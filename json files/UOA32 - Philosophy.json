The first of these, `Holy Communion', called for closer\u000d\u000aco-operation between religious and non-religious groups in tackling social ills such as poverty. The\u000d\u000asecond, `Beyond Belief', examined the nature of religious belief. It questioned claims that religions\u000d\u000ashould be identified solely as social institutions. The reach of this impact is demonstrated by the\u000d\u000amagazine's sales figures, and by online hits specific to Norman's articles:\u000d\u000a&#8212; `Holy Communion', in New Humanist, Vol. 122, Issue 6 (2007).

Sales figures for Vol. 124, Issue 6 are approximately 4,500 (3,500\u000d\u000asubscriptions; 1,000 news-stand) [Source A].\u000d\u000aThe content of these articles was also disseminated via a series of public lectures, which\u000d\u000adiscussed similar themes. The lectures also stressed the need for a better understanding of\u000d\u000ahumanist beliefs in order to help promote dialogue between humanist and non-humanist groups:\u000d\u000a&#8212; 17 November 2009: A talk at a joint meeting of the British Humanist Association and the\u000d\u000aInter-Faith Network for the UK. This took place as part of Inter-Faith Week, one of the aims\u000d\u000aof which was to foster a better understanding `between people of religious and non-religious\u000d\u000abelief'. An Inter-Faith Network report notes that `[a]t the end of the meeting there was\u000d\u000ageneral agreement that it had been a very useful and constructive occasion, which had led\u000d\u000ato some increase in understanding between the religious and humanist perspectives'\u000d\u000a[Source E].\u000d\u000a&#8212; 21 July 2010: A public lecture titled `On Humanism - Thinking in Action'.\u000d\u000a&#8212; 18 January 2012: A public lecture titled `Humanism for a Better World'.\u000d\u000aA recording of `On Humanism - Thinking in Action' is available on YouTube [Source F]. It has been\u000d\u000aviewed over 600 times.\u000d\u000aThese activities led to the publication of The Case for Secularism (2007), in association with the\u000d\u000aBritish Humanist Association (BHA). Norman edited and authored the text for this publication,\u000d\u000awhich was based on the results of extensive group debate between members of the BHA. On 18\u000d\u000aMarch 2010, The Case for Secularism was the focus of Parliamentary debate in the House of\u000d\u000aLords. One of the central themes of Norman's research, namely the desirability of creating a\u000d\u000asociety underpinned by shared liberal values, featured prominently in this debate. In her\u000d\u000acontribution to the debate, Baroness Massey of Darwen noted that `The Case for Secularism\u000d\u000amaintains that the state should be \"neutral between [...] differing values and should not impose a\u000d\u000aconception of the good life\". If only all states could do this, we might be spared some of the\u000d\u000aconflicts evident in our world today.' Lord McKenzie of Luton observed that The Case for\u000d\u000aSecularism `challenge[s] the misconception that humanists and other non-religious people are anti-religious' and recommended its `accessible and thoughtful contributions to public debate' [Source\u000d\u000aG].\u000d\u000aOn 3 November 2011, Norman spoke as a member of a panel at a meeting hosted by the All-Party\u000d\u000aParliamentary Humanist Group. This meeting was held to launch Right to Object: Conscientious\u000d\u000aObjection and Religious Conviction, a BHA publication co-authored by Norman. He addressed the\u000d\u000asame topic on 26 January 2011 for BBC Radio 4's The Moral Maze [Source I]. Debates on The\u000d\u000aMoral Maze consistently have about a million listeners on air and about 10,000 listeners online\u000d\u000a[Source J].\u000d\u000aThe impact which Norman's work has generated in the UK has also begun to generate further\u000d\u000aimpact on an international level. On 12 August 2011, Norman gave a keynote address at the World\u000d\u000aHumanist Congress, held in Oslo, which had over 500 attendees from 50 countries [Source D].\u000d\u000aThis address drew on issues raised in Ethics, Killing and War, discussing the need for humanists to\u000d\u000atake account of and build on the Christian tradition of ethical thinking about war. A video recording\u000d\u000aof this address has been uploaded to YouTube [Source H]. Norman spoke on a similar theme in\u000d\u000a2013, addressing the UK Armed Forces Humanist Association with a lecture entitled `The Ethics of\u000d\u000aKilling'.\u000d\u000aThe BHA describes Norman's research as making `an enormous impact in a number of public\u000d\u000apolicy areas', and as having `contributed significantly to the public understanding of humanist\u000d\u000athought' [Source B]. Philosopher Julian Baggini describes Norman's research as having `provided\u000d\u000aa valuable contribution to the public understanding of secular humanism which counters the more\u000d\u000ascientistic, strident, simplistic norm'. Due to Norman's public activities, he writes, `thousands of\u000d\u000apeople have had this direct contact with a serious humanist thinker and will have had important\u000d\u000aideas explained to and discussed with them at a much higher level of sophistication than they\u000d\u000awould otherwise' [Source C].\u000d\u000aIn sum, Norman has made use of a variety of channels to change the way the public thinks about\u000d\u000ahumanism: magazine articles, videos, talks, radio discussion, humanist publications and political\u000d\u000adebate. By promulgating his views, his work has been an important contributing factor in the recent\u000d\u000aresurgence of humanism (the BHA now has over 28,000 members and the International Humanist\u000d\u000aand Ethical Union has 117 member organisations from 38 countries). That humanist thought is\u000d\u000abecoming increasingly relevant is witnessed by the growth of the religiously unaffiliated in census\u000d\u000adata: the proportion of people who identify themselves as having no religion is up from 14.8% in\u000d\u000a2001 to 25.1% in 2011 in England and Wales; the proportion of religiously unaffiliated is up from\u000d\u000a15.3% in 2007 to 19.6% in 2012 in the US; about 16% of the global population, i.e., 1.1 billion\u000d\u000apeople, do not identify with any particular religion.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aProfessor Richard Norman's research has led to an improvement in the public awareness of\u000d\u000ahumanist thought and value, both at national and international level.

This book defines humanism as a non-religious worldview, but maintains that\u000d\u000athere is more to humanism than the simple rejection of religious beliefs. It does this by highlighting\u000d\u000athe contiguities between humanist and religious perspectives on morality, and on what makes for a\u000d\u000agood human life. Norman's research therefore departs from the movement sometimes referred to\u000d\u000aas `New Atheism'. New Atheism is uncompromisingly hostile to all manifestations of religious belief,\u000d\u000aand its exponents are often reluctant to identify any common ground between religious and non-religious perspectives. As a result, New Atheism is often considered to be socially divisive.\u000d\u000aNorman's work should be seen as a conciliatory corrective to the polemical tone of New Atheist\u000d\u000aliterature.\u000d\u000aNorman's research emphasises the need to pay close attention to the nuances of religious belief.\u000d\u000aThe potential to engage in constructive public debate is ill-served by commentators who fail to\u000d\u000aacknowledge the complexity of religion as a social phenomenon, and who do not appreciate the\u000d\u000aheterogeneous nature of religious belief. Norman emphasises the importance of this issue in his\u000d\u000aarticle `Secularism and Shared Values' (2009).\u000d\u000aIn `What do Religious Believers Believe?' (2011), Norman examines the nature of religious belief.\u000d\u000aHe responds to those philosophers who claim that modern religions exist primarily as social\u000d\u000ainstitutions, rather than as metaphysical explanations of the existence of the universe. Norman\u000d\u000aargues that religions necessarily make putatively factual statements about why the world is as it is.\u000d\u000aThis, he argues, shows that religious belief is a legitimate subject for rational debate, in a way that\u000d\u000ait would not be if religions were understood solely as social institutions.\u000d\u000aIn Ethics, Killing and War (1995), Norman critically discusses traditional approaches to just war\u000d\u000atheory. Just war theory was heavily influenced by early Christian thinkers such as Augustine, and\u000d\u000aNorman argues that this influence is still present in modern, secular attempts to legitimise war.\u000d\u000aNorman argues that there are serious philosophical deficiencies in traditional approaches to just\u000d\u000awar theory, and argues for the conclusion that, in more instances than are generally\u000d\u000aacknowledged, the decision to go to war is not morally justifiable. This position reflects the\u000d\u000ahumanist values which are the subject of Norman's later research, and the book as a whole\u000d\u000aexemplifies the way in which humanists can engage in constructive moral debate with religious\u000d\u000atraditions.\u000d\u000aThe key insights of Norman's research are:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThe standard of public debate regarding the place of religion in society must be improved\u000d\u000aby promoting a deeper understanding both of religious belief and of humanist thought.\u000d\u000aHumanism does not merely claim that God does not exist: it also actively engages with\u000d\u000amany of the ethical questions discussed by religious thinkers. Humanism is a perspective\u000d\u000afrom which both religious and non-religious individuals can engage in secular debate.\u000d\u000aA humanist perspective can make important contributions to political issues such as the\u000d\u000ajustification for going to war. It does this by highlighting the historical influence of religious\u000d\u000atraditions on such debates, and by suggesting alternative ways of thinking about those\u000d\u000aissues.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"1425","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As Rowett has shown, Presocratic philosophy continually inspires new\u000d\u000a      ideas in its readers in every\u000d\u000a      period of Western thought. This is no less true now, as is evident in the\u000d\u000a      recent thought-provoking\u000d\u000a      effect of her work on a variety of readerships beyond the academy, in the\u000d\u000a      UK and abroad. It should\u000d\u000a      be noted that making people think is itself the impact &#8212; not so much the\u000d\u000a      content of what they think,\u000d\u000a      since the point is not just to inform readers about the philosophy of the\u000d\u000a      past, but to provoke them to\u000d\u000a      engage in thinking afresh, about the questions that past philosophers\u000d\u000a      raise. The impact on\u000d\u000a      intellectual life is found in the very fact of people becoming interested\u000d\u000a      in what the Presocratics said,\u000d\u000a      and in their being caused to reflect on how those sayings apply to their\u000d\u000a      own life experiences.\u000d\u000a    Rowett's work in this field has generated two kinds of impact:\u000d\u000a    (a) Benefits to cultural and intellectual life in the UK and abroad,\u000d\u000a        particularly making people think\u000d\u000a        about philosophical ideas.\u000d\u000a    Osborne's Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction (IS1)\u000d\u000a      has been widely distributed, and\u000d\u000a      succeeds in transmitting the questions and puzzles opened for discussion\u000d\u000a      in the above research\u000d\u000a      (particularly RR2) to audiences outside academia. This generates awareness\u000d\u000a      of the riches of the\u000d\u000a      early history of western thought and of its relevance to the reader's own\u000d\u000a      concerns. Readers include\u000d\u000a      both the interested layman, and some of the people whom the REF calls\u000d\u000a      \"users\" of philosophical\u000d\u000a      research, evidenced (in this case) by Raymond Tallis (IS5), who then\u000d\u000a      provides further routes to\u000d\u000a      cultural and intellectual impact, particularly in his work for BBC Radio\u000d\u000a      (IS5, IS6). In addition, public\u000d\u000a      engagement achieves local impact in the UK: note particularly Rowett's\u000d\u000a      2012 Public Lecture in the\u000d\u000a      UEA Public Lectures on Philosophy and the Economic Crisis series, funded\u000d\u000a      by the Royal Institute\u000d\u000a      of Philosophy (IS10). Audience participation at the time (available on the\u000d\u000a      podcast) evidences the\u000d\u000a      activity of genuine open-minded thinking, including asking important\u000d\u000a      questions about current affairs\u000d\u000a      and policy, actually going on live in the lecture room on this occasion,\u000d\u000a      provoked by a lecture that\u000d\u000a      drew upon Presocratic ideas.\u000d\u000a    Reach:\u000d\u000a    We measure the reach of this intellectual impact by (i) sales of\u000d\u000a      IS1 (on the basis that with each\u000d\u000a      book bought, someone's thirst for knowledge of their cultural heritage is\u000d\u000a      slaked and their ability to\u000d\u000a      think philosophically is provoked), (ii) the demand for translations of\u000d\u000a      IS1 for markets beyond the UK\u000d\u000a      and America, and (iii) audience numbers at public events (IS3, IS4, IS10).\u000d\u000a    (i) Sales of IS1 in English currently exceed 10,000 (approaching 13,500\u000d\u000a      in 2013). For some\u000d\u000a      years it has been the best-selling book about Presocratic Philosophy on\u000d\u000a      Amazon.com (not\u000d\u000a      counting translations of the texts). Customer reviews on Amazon show that\u000d\u000a      the readers are\u000d\u000a      actively engaging with the research issues presented &#8212; that they are being\u000d\u000a      made to think. Some\u000d\u000a      respond enthusiastically, others more reluctantly, to that challenge: both\u000d\u000a      reactions show that\u000d\u000a      the challenge is working.\u000d\u000a    (ii) Free distribution of a Greek translation of IS1 in 2006 to over\u000d\u000a      40,000 readers of the Greek\u000d\u000a      daily newspaper has led to further translations being envisaged, e.g.\u000d\u000a      Portuguese, Vietnamese.\u000d\u000a      Further Francophone audiences are reached via Osborne's chapter in Histoire\u000d\u000a        de la\u000d\u000a        Philosophie ed.

Rowett's inaugural lecture in\u000d\u000a      2009 drew a mixed\u000d\u000a      audience of over 100. In April 2012 Rowett featured along with\u000d\u000a      primatologist Professor Volker\u000d\u000a      Sommer and anthropologist Professor Ruth Mace in a panel discussing the\u000d\u000a      \"origins of\u000d\u000a      humanity\" at the LSE (podcast available, IS4), part of a popular programme\u000d\u000a      for the public\u000d\u000a      organised by the Forum for European Philosophy, with 200+ in the audience.\u000d\u000a      Podcast hits in\u000d\u000a      five months, May-Sept 2012 totalled 14,260 (NB this measure is hits\u000d\u000a        recorded by the server,\u000d\u000a        not downloads or viewings.) Rowett co-tutored an extra-mural weekend\u000d\u000a      school for the Oxford\u000d\u000a      Department for Continuing Education at Rewley House, with Malcolm\u000d\u000a      Schofield, on The Origins\u000d\u000a        of Metaphysics in Presocratic Philosophy in May 2012 (IS3). There\u000d\u000a      were 46 resident attenders,\u000d\u000a      and the podcasts were then circulated to 330 members of the Oxford\u000d\u000a      Philosophical Society. In\u000d\u000a      Autumn 2012, Rowett's lecture `Learning from Greece: thinking about\u000d\u000a      austerity and monetary\u000d\u000a      union in Pythagorean and Platonic politics' in the UEA Philosophy Public\u000d\u000a      Lectures series on the\u000d\u000a      Economic Crisis drew an audience of c.70, and explored the roots of the\u000d\u000a      economic crisis and\u000d\u000a      possible solutions and revaluations by way of reflections on Pythagorean\u000d\u000a      and Platonic political\u000d\u000a      thought. (Podcast available: IS10).\u000d\u000a    Significance:\u000d\u000a    Quantifiable measures of the significance of this work include\u000d\u000a      statistical measures of the\u000d\u000a      uptake of the various events and publications, such as book sales,\u000d\u000a      audience numbers and\u000d\u000a      podcast visitors. These give some indication of the importance that people\u000d\u000a      attach in their lives\u000d\u000a      to such intellectual activity, by quantifying their commitment in terms of\u000d\u000a      the time and money\u000d\u000a      that they will spend on improving their understanding and engaging with\u000d\u000a      the cultural heritage of\u000d\u000a      Western thought. Another key marker of significance is the extent to which\u000d\u000a      these topics feature\u000d\u000a      in public debate, e.g. on BBC Radio, Oxford Literary Festival, Hay on Wye\u000d\u000a      Festival, European\u000d\u000a      Forum, etc. Raymond Tallis reports (IS5) that he found Rowett's work very\u000d\u000a      useful for situating\u000d\u000a      Parmenides, in preparing his Continuum 2007 book The Enduring Legacy\u000d\u000a        of Parmenides:\u000d\u000a        Unthinkable Thought, and that \"this fed into various popular\u000d\u000a      outlets: articles in Philosophy Now\u000d\u000a      and Prospect and Night Waves and a very well attended talk\u000d\u000a      at the Hay Festival.\" The Night\u000d\u000a        Waves programme (IS6) chaired by Philip Dodd, (BBC Radio 3, 19th\u000d\u000a      April 2011), investigated\u000d\u000a      Rowett's key question about the significance of Parmenides in Western\u000d\u000a      Philosophy,\u000d\u000a      problematised in RR2 and disseminated to non-academic users via IS1.\u000d\u000a      Tallis also has a\u000d\u000a      podcast on this topic, on Philosophybites.com, which has had 1,596 viewers\u000d\u000a      on YouTube (IS5).\u000d\u000a      The choice of \"Presocratic Metaphysics\" as a topic for IS3 (Oxford\u000d\u000a      Extra-Mural weekend\u000d\u000a      School) testifies to the importance this ancient wisdom has for those\u000d\u000a      outside professional\u000d\u000a      philosophy, for whom philosophy is (as it always has been) an authentic\u000d\u000a      way of life.\u000d\u000a    (b) Impact on new investors on the stock exchange\u000d\u000a    Rowett's work on the Sophists, has been adopted by the Reuters\u000d\u000a      journalist Alexander Davidson.\u000d\u000a      His book The Money Myth: A Classic Introduction to the Modern World of\u000d\u000a        Finance and Investing,\u000d\u000a      commissioned by FT Pearson (IS7), is a guide for beginners planning to\u000d\u000a      invest in stocks and\u000d\u000a      shares. It warns them of the risks of untrustworthy advisers. Of the\u000d\u000a      significance of Rowett's work,\u000d\u000a      Alexander Davidson writes (IS8) \"This book was my `eureka' moment as a\u000d\u000a      financial journalist. By\u000d\u000a      showing that the ancient Greek sophists were just like our spin-doctors,\u000d\u000a      Osborne proves there is\u000d\u000a      nothing new about the propagandist techniques that helped to crash the\u000d\u000a      City in the Credit Crunch\u000d\u000a      but then rescued it. I read this book in one sitting &#8212; and it gave me in\u000d\u000a      return a cutting edge seminar\u000d\u000a      in ancient philosophy and its modern messages.

Customer reviews\u000d\u000a      (IS9) and readers' correspondence would testify to a rather small part of\u000d\u000a      this.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research on Presocratic philosophy by Catherine Rowett (formerly Osborne)\u000d\u000a      has had impact on\u000d\u000a      the wider public, both at home and abroad, in two key areas: (a) it has\u000d\u000a      helped to satisfy the\u000d\u000a      intellectual and cultural curiosity of people in the UK and beyond; and\u000d\u000a      (b) it has extended public\u000d\u000a      understanding of the potential risks and rewards of stock-market\u000d\u000a      investments.

To date she has twelve research publications on the\u000d\u000a      Presocratics. About half\u000d\u000a      of them, including many recent publications, expose the importance of\u000d\u000a      these thinkers in the\u000d\u000a      Western intellectual heritage, including Christianity, Neoplatonism,\u000d\u000a      Cambridge Platonism, 17th\u000d\u000a      Century European philosophy and 19th\/20th Century\u000d\u000a      history of ideas. The significance of\u000d\u000a      Presocratic thought to all periods of Western thought, including our own,\u000d\u000a      is the most exciting\u000d\u000a      finding here: for in every generation we repeatedly repossess the earliest\u000d\u000a      ideas in recorded\u000d\u000a      western thought, and make them our own. This has ramifications for\u000d\u000a      understanding the\u000d\u000a      philosophical motivations of many later texts, including major works in\u000d\u000a      the canon of great classics\u000d\u000a      of Western civilization.\u000d\u000a    In 'Was there an Eleatic Revolution?' (RR2) Osborne traced the origins of\u000d\u000a      the current Anglo-American\u000d\u000a      habit of treating Parmenides as a turning point in Presocratic philosophy,\u000d\u000a      and regarding\u000d\u000a      Heraclitus as earlier, less inspired, even muddled. By contrast, in the\u000d\u000a      continental tradition,\u000d\u000a      Heraclitus is celebrated as the most inspirational thinker &#8212;\u000d\u000a      post-Parmenides and in conversation\u000d\u000a      with him. RR2 was written for the AHRC project `Rethinking Revolutions'.\u000d\u000a      It underpins Osborne's\u000d\u000a      popular Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford\u000d\u000a      University Press 2004) (IS1)\u000d\u000a      which was commissioned by the Open University Press in 2003 on the basis\u000d\u000a      of Osborne's existing\u000d\u000a      reputation for high quality research in this field. IS1 is the medium by\u000d\u000a      which the above research is\u000d\u000a      achieving impact: for instance IS1 was among the works read by Raymond\u000d\u000a      Tallis, which inspired\u000d\u000a      him to focus a BBC Radio 3 Nightwaves programme (IS6) on that very\u000d\u000a      question, \"Is Parmenides\u000d\u000a      the turning point?\"; and it was IS1 that inspired Alexander Davidson (IS7,\u000d\u000a      IS8).\u000d\u000a    Alexander Davidson (IS7) was particularly influenced by Osborne's\u000d\u000a      assessment of the Sophists as\u000d\u000a      \"spin doctors\" and sellers of education as a commodity. This line of\u000d\u000a      argument is developed not only\u000d\u000a      in her Presocratics research but also in some of Rowett's recent work on\u000d\u000a      Plato, particularly her\u000d\u000a      analysis the philosophical views of the character Protagoras in Plato's Protagoras\u000d\u000a      and Theaetetus\u000d\u000a      (RR6).

AFG is a new coalition of NGOs, who\u000d\u000ahave agreed to work \"to ensure that long-termism and the needs of future generations are brought\u000d\u000ainto the heart of UK democracy and policy processes, in order to safeguard the earth and secure\u000d\u000aintergenerational justice\". It includes groups such as Friends of the Earth, and WWF. Its members\u000d\u000acollectively run into millions.\u000d\u000aOn 28th October 2011, on the basis of these discussions, the AFG produced an Open Challenge\u000d\u000aPaper (IS2), for consideration towards the United Nations Conference on Sustainable\u000d\u000aDevelopment, Rio+20, to be held June 20-22nd 2012. This paper advocated the idea of \"High\u000d\u000aCommissioners for Future Generations\" and a \"Commission on future generations\" as central\u000d\u000atargets for implementation at Rio.\u000d\u000aIn January 2012, the co-Chairs of the Rio+20 UN Conference, on behalf of the Bureau, produced\u000d\u000athe draft Outcome document, entitled The Future We Want (IS3). This was the \"zero-draft\", for\u000d\u000aconsideration by Member States and other stakeholders, in preparation for Rio. IS3 contains a\u000d\u000aproposal for a \"UN High Commissioner for Future Generations\", as suggested by the AFG in IS2.\u000d\u000aSince the U.N. group who prepared IS3 had access to IS2, and IS3 closely mirrors IS2 in\u000d\u000asubstance, it is reasonable to assume some causation from IS1 by way of IS2 to IS3.\u000d\u000aIn the event, the finished Outcome Document signed off at the UN Conference Rio+20 fell short\u000d\u000aof the goals envisaged in the draft document. It did not follow IS3 to the point of appointing the\u000d\u000a\"High Commissioner\", as recommended in the draft Outcome Document.\u000d\u000aHowever, on 22nd June 2012 (the day that Rio+20 closed), UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon\u000d\u000aannounced that he would be appointing a `Special Representative for Future Generations'. We\u000d\u000aread in the BMZ Newsletter for July 2012 (IS4): \"UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced at\u000d\u000athe conference that he would be appointing a Special Representative for Future Generations.\u000d\u000aMinister Niebel welcomed the decision. \"This will give sustainability a recognisable face; that will\u000d\u000abe important in moving forward the international debate. ... The Special Representative will be a\u000d\u000akind of travelling advert for sustainability.\" The details of how this magistracy will be established\u000d\u000aand its role are still under discussion. In any case, it seems reasonable to see a causal route from\u000d\u000athe proposal presented by Rupert Read in 2011, to the creation of this new UN magistracy in 2012.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aii Impact in Europe:\u000d\u000aHungary already has a High Commissioner for Future Generations. The role is currently occupied\u000d\u000aby Sandor Fulop. Fulop and other experts in his office have identified Read's proposal as\u000d\u000apreferable to the current model used in Hungary, which offers less substantial protection.\u000d\u000aFulop has championed Read's solutions for Europe and the UK on several occasions. He sent a\u000d\u000amessage of support (IS7) to the launch event at the House of Commons in Jan 2012. He agreed to\u000d\u000aspeak, via Skype, at the King's Place event in April 2012. On that occasion he observed that \"a\u000d\u000aguardian or high representative for future generations somewhere in the organisational structure of\u000d\u000athe United Nations\" is badly needed. This too may have played a causal role in leading to Ban Ki-moon's decision to pursue such a policy following Rio+20.\u000d\u000aiii Impact in the UK:\u000d\u000aAt several high profile events in the UK, Read has brought his ideas to the attention of those\u000d\u000ainvolved in debating and formulating policy. We can confirm, on the basis of testimonials, that this\u000d\u000ahas significantly altered the terms of debate and the range of policy options for consideration.\u000d\u000aThe following narrative lists events and policy documents which together constitute evidence of\u000d\u000areaching the target audiences:\u000d\u000a(i) Documents explaining the proposal were forwarded to Parliament's Environmental Audit\u000d\u000aCommittee, in late 2010;\u000d\u000a(ii) Work-in-progress discussion papers and documents were presented at several meetings of the\u000d\u000a`Alliance for Future Generations', during 2011;\u000d\u000a(iii) The finished document \"Guardians of the Future\" (IS1) was launched at a high-profile event at\u000d\u000athe House of Commons, Jan. 10th 2012. Speakers included Caroline Lucas MP, Jon Cruddas MP\u000d\u000aand Norman Baker MP, a Co-ordinator of the AFG (Nicolo Wojewoda) and Peter Roderick (author\u000d\u000aof Taking the Longer View). There were comments from other politicians, journalists, and major\u000d\u000aplayers in British NGOs. A podcast of this event is available at IS5.\u000d\u000a(iv) On 25th April 2012, The Guardian, in collaboration with Green House, hosted an event at King's\u000d\u000aPlace in London. It was chaired by Damian Carrington, Environment Editor of The Guardian.\u000d\u000aRead's \"Guardians\" idea was one of two proposals concerning \"Care for the Future\" that had been\u000d\u000aselected for discussion. The event included an experiment with a mock \"super-jury\".\u000d\u000aThe following testimonials bear witness to the effects on political thinking in the UK:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aJon Cruddas MP, now leading Labour's Policy Review, commented at the Parliamentary event\u000d\u000ain Jan 2012 that the Guardians idea was \"deeply thought-provoking\" and that \"we need a\u000d\u000ahundred ideas like this\" (IS5).\u000d\u000aThe Rt Hon Lord Howarth of Newport writes (IS8) \"Dr Read has already influenced my own\u000d\u000athinking and spurred me to argue in Parliament (for example in my submission to the Political\u000d\u000aand Constitutional Reform Select Committee on House of Lords reform) that it is imperative that\u000d\u000awe find better ways institutionally to acquit ourselves of our responsibilities to future\u000d\u000agenerations\".\u000d\u000aIan Christie, an Associate of the Green Alliance think-tank, and former Senior Fellow, Policy\u000d\u000aStudies Institute, writes (IS10) \"Dr Rupert Read's paper on the scope for a system of\u000d\u000a'Guardians' for the interests of future generations has had a significant impact in many of the\u000d\u000anetworks in which I work. His paper has been very widely circulated and discussed online and in\u000d\u000athink-tank, NGO and academic circles known to me. It has been one of the main catalysts for\u000d\u000afresh thinking about future generations and their representation in democratic process, as\u000d\u000adeveloped recently by bodies such as the Alliance for Future Generations, the Foundation for\u000d\u000aDemocracy and Sustainable Development, and the think-tank Green House.\"\u000d\u000aPeter Roderick, author of the definitive report \"Taking the Longer View\" commissioned by WWF\u000d\u000aand the Foundation for Democracy and Sustainable Development, writes (IS9) \"I became aware\u000d\u000aof Dr Read's proposal for `guardians for future generations' during my work for WWF-UK on\u000d\u000along-term governance options in the face of increasing pressure on the stability and resilience of\u000d\u000athe Earth's natural processes. It was by far the most novel and far-reaching of such proposals\u000d\u000athat I looked at: giving guardians law-making powers had not previously been a part of the\u000d\u000adebate. It raised several thorny legal issues in my mind, and over time, with his willingness to\u000d\u000aengage with and work through these, I came to the view that the proposal was both workable\u000d\u000aand worthy of serious consideration. I therefore included it in my report (`Taking the longer view:\u000d\u000aUK governance options for a finite planet, December 2010), contributed to its continued\u000d\u000adevelopment and attended its presentation at the House of Commons.\"\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a(b) Public Discourse and public understanding\u000d\u000aOur impact on public discourse is evidenced by the uptake in public debating fora and the media.\u000d\u000ai Media coverage:\u000d\u000aPositive coverage by Damian Carrington in the Guardian online, 4th Jan 2012 (IS6), attracting\u000d\u000a325 comments between 4th and 11th Jan 2012; a polemical satire piece by Brendan O'Neill in\u000d\u000athe Telegraph online on 5th Jan 2012, attracting 118 comments between 5th and 14th January\u000d\u000a(many defending Read).\u000d\u000aExtensive local media coverage is listed on our impact sources web page (see IS6).\u000d\u000aii Websites and discussion fora:\u000d\u000aLinks to a selection of typical website coverage are provided on our web page (see IS6).

Read has presented his work at Camp for Climate\u000d\u000aAction Conference, London, 29\/11\/2009 and `Changing the climate: Utopias', Monash,\u000d\u000aAustralia 30\/8\/10-1\/9\/10 (by audiolink), and was invited to the Town and Country Planning\u000d\u000aAssociation Roundtable on Governance, for the 'Reconstructing England' Inquiry.\u000d\u000aiv Articles in print:\u000d\u000aRead writes for a range of popular and political magazines. See IS6.\u000d\u000aThe reach of these media and public-facing activities ranges from thousands to millions. The reach\u000d\u000aof our impact on public discourse is measured by audience numbers\/readership for programmes\u000d\u000aand articles, and in subsequent invitations to appear on the media.\u000d\u000aThe significance of the work is evident in the interest shown by the quality press, and particularly in\u000d\u000athe Guardian's interest in promoting the King's Place event.\u000d\u000aAs Peter Roderick explains (IS9): \"The proposal came at a time when civil society, both in the UK\u000d\u000aand internationally, has been paying greater attention to inter-generational equity, notably in the\u000d\u000arun-up to (and since) the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (June 2012). Recognition of\u000d\u000athe needs and interests of future generations remains a live and growing debate, and Dr Read's\u000d\u000aproposal has helped to focus minds not only on policies to reflect that recognition, but on where\u000d\u000awithin governance structures such recognition should be located. I think of his proposal and\u000d\u000aphilosophical approach as enriching, and as forming one of the book-ends of, that debate.\"\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThe aim of Guardians for future generations is to develop a method of giving future generations a\u000d\u000asay in current policy-making discussions, by applying Rupert Read's innovative thinking about the\u000d\u000anature and ideals of democracy.

This research activity has led to a number of publications\u000d\u000aincluding the following:\u000d\u000aRR1 is Read's forthcoming paper, 'Guardians for future generations: a modest Platonic proposal?',\u000d\u000ain JIRR.

Without their consent, the community\u000d\u000acannot legitimately make decisions.\u000d\u000aRR2-5 are earlier papers on future people. Read argues that that we need the same caring\/loving\u000d\u000aattitude toward future people as towards our own children. Attitudes based around \"justice\" are\u000d\u000ainsufficient, he suggests. His choice of the term \"guardian\" deliberately evokes the vicarious care\u000d\u000aof children.\u000d\u000aRR6-7 are on democracy. Read suggests that democracy, as an ideal, is hard to square with\u000d\u000alibertarianism or with liberalism as it currently exists. To achieve genuine democracy we need to go\u000d\u000abeyond aggregation of votes and distant representation.\u000d\u000aBarbara Goodwin's work on the 2005 revision of her `Justice by Lottery' was one stimulus feeding\u000d\u000ainto the earlier stages of Read's research on sortition, the results of which appear in RR1-7.\u000d\u000aGoodwin was at UEA until her retirement in 2011.\u000d\u000aOn the basis of this research on democratic theory and the idea of sortition, Read himself has\u000d\u000adeveloped and promoted a practical political proposal, for a body of appointed \"Guardians of the\u000d\u000aFuture\" in the UK. He has also recommended similar solutions in other contexts (e.g. the UN).\u000d\u000aThe route to impact from this research is by way of Read's own direct application of the ideas to\u000d\u000ainternational political structures, and via the enterprise activities of the UEA School of Philosophy,\u000d\u000ain promoting the ideas, in the media and to policy makers, with the results shown. NB The use of\u000d\u000asortition in Read's proposal has the explicit and deliberate effect of limiting the influence of party\u000d\u000apolitics.

It was a\u000a      response to a problem identified by teachers during an engagement and\u000a      outreach consultation. While independent critical thinking is an intrinsic\u000a      element of the A-level Philosophy syllabus, and the marking criteria for\u000a      the A-level examinations require critical engagement for gaining the\u000a      highest marks,5-1 there is a dearth of educational materials\u000a      able to foster it in relation to the set texts and topics. The skills of\u000a      critical engagement are learned through practice, which requires an\u000a      appropriate framework for developing conclusions, drawn from careful\u000a      consideration of alternatives. The insight for the Unit's research to\u000a      contribute in addressing this problem was that the contrasting positions\u000a      within some of the Unit's recent research publications on Nietzsche and on\u000a      moral philosophy naturally created such a framework. These publications\u000a      bear directly on two popular modules of the AS and A-level syllabus: `Why\u000a      Should I Be Moral?' (AS) and `Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil'\u000a      (A2). As a result, the booklet simultaneously provides research input at\u000a      the topic level and, through a set of questions and puzzles after the\u000a      texts, draws out the disagreements and encourages students to develop\u000a      views on the debate.\u000a    Process: The booklet was developed on the basis of\u000a      information gathered at two one-day conferences for A-level Philosophy\u000a      teachers and students held at Cardiff University in November 2011 (20\u000a      students, 5 teachers) and March 2012 (50 students, 5 teachers). The\u000a      conferences served two purposes. One was to identify through targeted\u000a      discussion what the teachers most wanted from new teaching materials. The\u000a      other was to gauge how sixth-formers responded to the ideas we presented,\u000a      so that we could calibrate explanations of our research at the appropriate\u000a      level of accessibility. The booklet was developed particularly through\u000a      close discussion with two A-level teachers in very different educational\u000a      settings: Marc Bevan of Llanidloes High School in rural Powys,5-6\u000a      and Pamela Marshall of Exeter College, a combined further and higher\u000a      education institution. Bevan used the conference handouts to structure\u000a      class discussion and Marshall tested first drafts of the booklet essays\u000a      with her students. Marshall was the one originally to propose that a\u000a      booklet might be developed to help A-level students with their critical\u000a      evaluation of Nietzsche.5-5\u000a    During the summer of 2012, the booklet of six 1000-word essays was\u000a      produced.5-2 The first half of the booklet comprises essays by\u000a      Robertson, Tanesini and Webber, laying out the core claims in their\u000a      respective research papers. These essays make the tensions between our\u000a      views apparent. Each essay is accompanied by two comprehension questions.\u000a      They are followed by two puzzle pages that set up the tasks of critically\u000a      comparing and assessing the ideas. The second half of the booklet deepens\u000a      the debate through three essays by the same authors that extend the\u000a      research discussions, again with comprehension questions. The booklet\u000a      closes with further puzzles concerning the disagreements between these\u000a      essays.\u000a    This design allows teachers and students to engage with the booklet in\u000a      the ways they find most appropriate. Teachers can use it to develop their\u000a      own teaching inputs or distribute it to their students. Engaging with a\u000a      single essay will be beneficial, but working through the first half of the\u000a      booklet provides a solid basis for independent argumentation concerning\u000a      Nietzsche's critique of morality. Students can check their understanding\u000a      using the comprehension questions, and can develop their own critical\u000a      views before they read the second essay set, so that, in effect, they gain\u000a      feedback on the ideas they have had.\u000a    The booklet was launched with a dedicated conference in December 2012. It\u000a      was made available as a free download under a Creative Commons licence.\u000a      Teachers can freely distribute it to their students in paper form or\u000a      through virtual learning environments. It was advertised through a network\u000a      of A-level Philosophy teachers, the Philosophy in Europe email list\u000a      (Philos-L), and our Twitter feed.\u000a    The change that this booklet has made to the set of available educational\u000a      materials is significant in that it not only informs students\u000a      about Nietzsche's work and opposing views of it, but also impacts on\u000a      students' meta-learning. That is, critical thinking practised in relation\u000a      to Nietzsche can be transferred to other topics within and beyond\u000a      philosophy.5-5,5-6 The head of Exeter College describes the\u000a      booklet as \"a great response to the problem I raised in discussion [with\u000a      the team]\" and says that \"the experience of working through the booklet\u000a      has improved my students' abilities to engage critically with philosophy\u000a      across the syllabus and generally to argue philosophically.\"5-5\u000a    Nature of impact: The booklet constitutes an effect on,\u000a        and benefit to, society in providing a new kind of study material\u000a      that influences the activity, awareness, capacity and understanding\u000a      of A-level students. The impact is significant in making a\u000a      tangible and effective change to the quality of philosophy teaching at\u000a      A-level. The booklet is a direct conduit of the research undertaken in the\u000a      Unit, which, in representing different philosophical views, creates the\u000a      basis for the critical discussion and evaluation that teachers reported\u000a      difficulty in achieving by other means. As for its reach, although\u000a      the text was developed in consultation with teachers and school students\u000a      in Wales and SW England, the booklet is in use across the UK. The AQA\u000a      Chief Examiner for A-level philosophy has approved the booklet for use as\u000a      a teaching and study resource (see below), and since the AQA offers the\u000a      only A-level philosophy syllabus, that means the booklet is a recognised\u000a      resource for every philosophy A-level student in the UK: some 2941 A-level\u000a      and 5129 AS level philosophy candidates in June 2013 (http:\/\/www.aqa.org.uk\/exams-administration\/about-\u000a        results\/results-statistics). Were the estimated 551 UK views and\u000a      downloads (see below) all from students, approximately one in 15 (6.8%) of\u000a      them (551\/8070) would have accessed the booklet in its first year.\u000a      However, our evidence below indicates that most downloads are from\u000a      teachers, strongly suggesting that a considerably higher proportion of A\u000a      and AS level students were reached. Making the booklet freely available\u000a      for download has reached an additional user group in 46 countries beyond\u000a      the UK (see below).\u000a    Evidence of impact:\u000a    Downloads: Between the Dec 2012 launch and 31\/07\/13 the\u000a      booklet was viewed or downloaded 1100 times.5-3 While views and\u000a      downloads beyond the UK (47 countries) are a welcome extra (see\u000a      illustration), ranging across the world from Mexico to Japan and Mongolia,\u000a      from Oman to Canada and Barbados, the primary target was the UK. 422 were\u000a      recognised as being from IP addresses within the UK.

AQA also recommended it to teachers who contacted\u000a      them directly for advice.5-4\u000a    Use with A-level students: We used an online survey in June\u000a      and July 2013 to gauge the impact of the booklet. We advertised this\u000a      through the same channels as we had advertised the booklet. Respondents\u000a      were A-level philosophy teachers in a variety of settings, including state\u000a      secondary schools, private schools, and sixth-form and further education\u000a      colleges in the UK, a charity school in Singapore, and a community college\u000a      in New Zealand. Most respondents had used the booklet. 75% of respondents\u000a      said they would definitely use it next year.5-7 They reported\u000a      its use already as recommended private reading for students and as the\u000a      basis of classroom discussions. Users praised it as a good framework for\u000a      students to develop their own critical perspectives through the activities\u000a      that draw out the disagreements between the essays.5-6,5-7\u000a      (These activities were also praised on Twitter by John Taylor (http:\/\/bit.ly\/12BmRjj),\u000a      Head of Philosophy at Rugby School and author of Think Again: A\u000a        Philosophical Approach to Teaching, Continuum 2012.)\u000a    All survey respondents who had used the booklet considered it to have\u000a      improved their students' abilities to engage with philosophy more\u000a      generally, not just to have improved student work in the area the booklet\u000a      focuses on.

It is widely agreed among philosophers\u000a      that if morality is intended to prescribe all our actions, then it is an\u000a      obstacle to living a fulfilling life. The lesson usually drawn is that\u000a      morality should only set constraints that rule out certain actions, but\u000a      which leave a wide range of options available. Robertson draws on\u000a      Nietzsche to argue that this is mistaken, since morality understood as a\u000a      set of constraints remains an obstacle to fulfilment. In particular, he\u000a      argues that such constraints would prevent the flourishing of great\u000a      individuals. Although elements of this philosophical position were\u000a      developed before his arrival at Cardiff, his booklet chapters reflect the\u000a      full position, developed at Cardiff and first published in this paper.\u000a    Tanesini's paper3-2 charts a course between the\u000a      realist view that moral values exist independently of the ways in which we\u000a      see the world and the subjectivist view that moral values are merely\u000a      expressions of opinion. Tanesini draws on Nietzsche to argue that mere\u000a      opinions are not genuinely ways of valuing something. She argues that\u000a      evaluative attitudes are rather grounded in long-term commitment to a\u000a      goal. It is this kind of self-determination, the mark of the great\u000a      individual, that gives rise to genuinely valuable ethical values.\u000a    Webber's paper3-3 defends Kant's idea that each\u000a      action lays down law which governs the future actions of that person.\u000a      Philosophers generally agree that Kant's idea of `self-legislation' is\u000a      nonsensical, but Webber argues that this consensus presupposes a\u000a      particular understanding of the kind of legislation involved. Instead of\u000a      reading it as analogous to the passing of statute, we should read it as\u000a      analogous to the way judges set precedent. Interpreted so, Kant views\u000a      morality as the set of restrictions that need to be observed for actions\u000a      to set precedents that can be respected.\u000a    Together, these papers generate debates over the nature and acceptability\u000a      of Nietzsche's critique of morality. One question is the relation between\u000a      Robertson's and Tanesini's papers. If genuine values are those pursued by\u000a      great individuals, why should we accept that the flourishing of great\u000a      individuals is genuinely valuable? Is it because some great individuals\u000a      value it, rather than each simply valuing their own flourishing? If so,\u000a      where is the evidence? A second question concerns the relationship between\u000a      morality and self-determination. Robertson defends the Nietzschean view\u000a      that morality is a threat to self-determination, but Webber presents a\u000a      Kantian argument that morality is required for self-determination.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3701","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact falls under three heads: (i) the media attention devoted to\u000d\u000a      Professor Bostrom's work; (ii) the popular `wiki site' inspired by it; and\u000d\u000a      (iii) the play World of Wires and the novels Bedlam and The\u000a        Simulator each inspired by it.\u000d\u000a    (i) Media Attention\u000d\u000a    Almost as soon as Professor Bostrom's original article appeared, it\u000d\u000a      attracted considerable media attention, and this attention has remained\u000d\u000a      extensive ever since. Prior to 2008, he was interviewed on the core\u000d\u000a      argument by several radio stations, for several television programmes and\u000d\u000a      for several periodicals. Since the beginning of 2008, the interviews have\u000d\u000a      continued.

There\u000d\u000a      is an outline of his argument on the US National Public Radio website[ii].\u000d\u000a      In 2010, a special issue of The Philosopher's Magazine, which\u000d\u000a      provides a venue for philosophy in an accessible and entertaining format\u000d\u000a      for as wide an audience as possible, included Professor Bostrom's idea in\u000d\u000a      its list of `ideas of the century'. An on-line blog accompanying the\u000d\u000a      television series Nova, which describes itself as the most watched\u000d\u000a      documentary series on public television, is devoted to his argument[iii].\u000d\u000a      In 2013, the University of Georgia Science Library created a library\u000d\u000a      exhibit based on the argument[iv]. The media attention\u000d\u000a      has recently been heightened by the attempt by physicist Silas Beane (in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with others) to provide an empirical test for whether we are\u000d\u000a      living in a computer simulation[v]: the article in which\u000d\u000a      Professor Beane presents this test and in which he explicitly indicates\u000d\u000a      Professor Bostrom's inspiration for his work, is itself cited, in\u000d\u000a      connection with Professor Bostrom, on a number of websites, including\u000d\u000a      TechSpot and i09, as well as receiving further extensive discussion in the\u000d\u000a      media, including discussions in Time and on the BBC programme Today\u000d\u000a      [vi].

On it, Mr Jansch records his\u000d\u000a      inspiration in the following terms: `Ever since reading \"The Simulation\u000d\u000a      Argument\" by Nick Bostrom, I've been planning to create a wiki about the\u000d\u000a      subject, and to bring the information in a less academic, more accessible,\u000d\u000a      format.

Those who visit the site are able to create an account and\u000d\u000a      contribute in various ways. Many have added essays of their own. Some have\u000d\u000a      advanced further arguments for and against Professor Bostrom's position.\u000d\u000a      There is even some poetry that has been inspired by the original idea.\u000d\u000a    (iii) The Play World of Wires, the Novel Bedlam, and\u000d\u000a        the Novel The Simulator\u000d\u000a    At the beginning of 2012, a play World of Wires, adapted from an\u000d\u000a      earlier screenplay by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and directed by Jay Scheib,\u000d\u000a      was premiered in The Kitchen in New York [viii]. The\u000d\u000a      advance publicity for this play made explicit mention of Professor\u000d\u000a      Bostrom's influence and highlighted the importance of the idea that the\u000d\u000a      simulation hypothesis is not just a sceptical hypothesis, but one to be\u000d\u000a      taken seriously as an account of our actual situation. The play is\u000d\u000a      described as `a performance about the unveiling of a computer simulation\u000d\u000a      so powerful that it is capable of simulating the world and everything in\u000d\u000a      it,' and it is said to be inspired by the works of Professor Nick Bostrom,\u000d\u000a      who, `in his 2003 paper titled \"Are You Living in a Computer\u000d\u000a      Simulation?\"... theorised that there is a high probability that we are\u000d\u000a      currently living in a computer simulation'. Subsequent publicity has been\u000d\u000a      similar. The play is described as `an all-bets-off homage to the startling\u000d\u000a      possibility that you too might actually really be ones and zeroes in\u000d\u000a      someone else's immaculately programmed world' and is then said to be\u000d\u000a      `inspired by the works of Oxford University professor Nick Bostrom,\u000d\u000a      including his compelling paper, \"Are You Living in a Computer\u000d\u000a      Simulation?\"'\u000d\u000a    In a contemporary arts and culture website called Culturebot, Jay Scheib\u000d\u000a      was interviewed about the play. He was asked how the disciplines of\u000d\u000a      computer science and artificial intelligence had helped him generate\u000d\u000a      material for his play and about `the interface with professionals or\u000d\u000a      research in these fields'. He responded as follows:\u000d\u000a    For this production, someone approached me after a performance of Untitled\u000a        Mars [i.e. an earlier play in a trilogy of which World of Wires\u000d\u000a      is the third part] and said, `Oh my God, do you know the work of Nick\u000d\u000a      Bostrom?' So I found this guy who is the Director of the Future of\u000d\u000a      Humanity Institute and Professor of Philosophy at Oxford University. He\u000d\u000a      wrote a paper called `Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?' [to which\u000d\u000a      there is a link]. In the white paper he speculates that there's a pretty\u000d\u000a      high probability that we are in fact living in a computer simulation. It\u000d\u000a      turns out that the idea has a healthy following. The article is brilliant\u000d\u000a      and synthesizes a number of interests that I've had over the years growing\u000d\u000a      up, reading about simulation and finding myself drawn into the world of\u000d\u000a      MIT and artificial intelligence, so it's been an interesting ride.\u000d\u000a          [ix]\u000d\u000a    Reviews of the play have also highlighted Professor Bostrom's influence.\u000d\u000a      In the New York Times review, the reviewer remarks that the play\u000d\u000a      `was... inspired by an essay in The Philosophical Quarterly (by\u000d\u000a      Nick Bostrom) titled \"Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?\"'\u000d\u000a          [x]. In the on-line version of the review this remark\u000d\u000a      includes a link to Professor Bostrom's website on his argument.\u000d\u000a    In 2013 ,Christopher Brookmyre published a novel entitled Bedlam,\u000d\u000a      whose main character Ross Baker is much exercised by Professor Bostrom's\u000d\u000a      argument because his mind has somehow been rerouted into a computer game.\u000d\u000a      The enthusiastic Guardian review of Bedlam, by Sam\u000d\u000a      Jordison, opens with a summary of Professor Bostrom's argument and\u000d\u000a      proceeds to expand on its critical relevance to the novel, quoting Ross\u000d\u000a      Baker's own account of the argument [xi]. Later in the\u000d\u000a      review, Mr Jordison says: `Ross's journey into knowledge takes in more\u000d\u000a      Bostrom-inspired philosophy about the nature of existence and ethical\u000d\u000a      considerations about our growing digital heritage.' In July 2013, Nicholas\u000d\u000a      Hark published a novel entitled The Simulator, which takes place\u000d\u000a      at a time in the future when technology has advanced enough to allow for\u000d\u000a      realistic computer simulations. The main conceit of the novel is that the\u000d\u000a      military has set up special intervention units that take part in both real\u000d\u000a      and simulated homeland security exercises, but with the twist that they\u000d\u000a      never know which. In an e-mail to Professor Bostrom, just after the\u000d\u000a      publication of the novel, the author wrote, `[My novel] has been inspired\u000d\u000a      by your work.' [1]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    In 2003, Professor Nick Bostrom published a ground-breaking article\u000d\u000a      entitled `Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?', in which he advanced\u000d\u000a      arguments to suggest that it is more than just a sceptical hypothesis that\u000d\u000a      we might be living in a computer simulation, it is almost certainly the\u000d\u000a      case.

The idea that we might be living in a\u000d\u000a      computer simulation&#8212;a twentieth-century descendant of the Cartesian idea\u000d\u000a      that all our thoughts and experiences might be caused by some malicious\u000d\u000a      demon who is out to deceive us&#8212;had been familiar to both philosophers and\u000d\u000a      non-philosophers for some while before then. What was novel in Professor\u000d\u000a      Bostrom's article was his combined use of conceptual and empirical\u000d\u000a      considerations to show that, unless two other plausible ideas are\u000d\u000a      rejected, then this idea is more than just a horrific sceptical\u000d\u000a      hypothesis: it almost certainly represents our actual situation. What had\u000d\u000a      appeared up until then as nothing more than an item of science fiction, a\u000d\u000a      philosopher's artifice designed to test our intuitions concerning how much\u000d\u000a      we know about our environment, suddenly took on the appearance of a\u000d\u000a      hypothesis that demanded to be taken with the utmost seriousness. This\u000d\u000a      naturally captured the public's imagination. Professor Bostrom has\u000d\u000a      continued to refine, develop, and adapt his argument ever since then,\u000d\u000a      partly in response to various counterarguments. He published summaries of\u000d\u000a      his ideas in The Times Higher Education Supplement in 2003, in a\u000d\u000a      collection of essays on The Matrix in 2005, and in New\u000d\u000a        Scientist in 2006. He responded to counterarguments by Brian\u000d\u000a      Weatherson in `The Simulation Argument: Reply to Weatherson' in 2005 and\u000d\u000a      by Anthony Brueckner in `The Simulation Argument: Some Explanations' in\u000d\u000a      2008. In an article entitled `A Patch for the Simulation Argument',\u000d\u000a      written jointly with Marcin Kulczycki and published in 2011, he noted and\u000d\u000a      addressed a problem with his original argument. Finally, he has created a\u000d\u000a      website devoted to his argument on which there are links to these and\u000d\u000a      other related publications, and on which he addresses a number of\u000d\u000a      frequently asked questions about his ideas.\u000d\u000a    The argument of the original article is designed to show that at least\u000d\u000a      one of the following three propositions must be true: first, that the\u000d\u000a      human species is very likely to become extinct before it reaches what\u000d\u000a      could be called a `post-human' stage of development, i.e. a stage of\u000d\u000a      development at which the capacities of its members radically exceed those\u000d\u000a      of present human beings; second, that a post-human civilisation is\u000d\u000a      extremely unlikely to run computer simulations of its own evolutionary\u000d\u000a      history; and third, that we are almost certainly living in a computer\u000d\u000a      simulation. If the argument is successful, then anyone who wishes to\u000d\u000a      reject the first two propositions is forced to accept the third.\u000d\u000a    In his reply to Weatherson, Professor Bostrom rebuts an argument that the\u000d\u000a      third of these propositions needs to be weakened. In his reply to\u000d\u000a      Brueckner, he counters a misunderstanding of his original argument that\u000d\u000a      turns on the issue of whether beings in a computer simulation could\u000d\u000a      themselves create beings in a computer simulation. And in his joint\u000d\u000a      article with Kulczycki, he notes a possibility that he overlooked in his\u000d\u000a      original argument&#8212;that civilisations that eventually reach a post-human\u000d\u000a      stage of development have unusually brief prior histories compared to\u000d\u000a      other civilisations&#8212;before proceeding to outline two ways of repairing\u000d\u000a      this problem, both of which maintain the original conclusion.\u000d\u000a    Professor Bostrom was appointed to a postdoctoral research fellowship in\u000d\u000a      the Faculty of Philosophy at the beginning of 2003, shortly before he\u000d\u000a      published his original article. Since 2005, he has been Director of the\u000d\u000a      Future of Humanity Institute and, since 2011, Director of the Programme on\u000d\u000a      the Impacts of Future Technology, both under the auspices of the Oxford\u000d\u000a      Martin School.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3702","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    (i) Dr Pickard's Module for Prison Staff Training\u000d\u000a    In 2011, Dr Pickard was invited by the Department of Health and the\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Justice to develop a training module based on her work on\u000d\u000a      responsibility without blame. This was for the Knowledge and Understanding\u000d\u000a      Framework (KUF) for Working Effectively with Personality Disorder in the\u000d\u000a      Prison System, a joint NHS and National Offender Management Service (NOMS)\u000d\u000a      initiative which, in the words of Guy Cross, the Mental Health Act\u000d\u000a      Approvals Manager, is `to increase awareness of personality disorder and\u000d\u000a      improve capacity of staff to work effectively and create more\u000d\u000a      psychologically informed and rehabilitative environments within the prison\u000d\u000a      system' [1]. Dr Pickard's contract was with NOMS, and\u000d\u000a      her brief was to develop her work into training for prison staff [2].\u000d\u000a      After initially setting up some focus groups within prison and\u000d\u000a      high-security hospital settings, she presented a proposal to the\u000d\u000a      Department of Health and Ministry of Justice in 2012, and was invited to\u000d\u000a      develop a module for prison staff training. In February 2013, she\u000d\u000a      delivered a pilot of the module. Feedback from those who attended included\u000d\u000a      the following comments: `[The training] was relevant and insightful.'\u000d\u000a      `[It] gave practical help in how to address issues which staff will be\u000d\u000a      able to practise.' `I will be more mindful of residents' background, why\u000d\u000a      they may... behave in a certain way, [and]... how I respond to specific\u000d\u000a      behaviours.' In March 2013, Dr Pickard delivered something similar for\u000d\u000a      prison officers at HMP Gartree. Feedback from those who attended included\u000d\u000a      the following comments: `[The training] expanded my understanding to a\u000d\u000a      higher level.' `[It] has enhanced my understanding and I believe given me\u000d\u000a      an extra tool to help explain to prisoners when I have to challenge them.'\u000d\u000a      `[It] gave me insight into some of the offenders that I work with and how\u000d\u000a      I engage with them... [I] will look at how I interact with prisoners and\u000d\u000a      how I challenge them and react to them.' `[It] will help when discussing\u000d\u000a      difficult prisoners to consider how not to blame them but get them to take\u000d\u000a      responsibility.' Dr Pickard later worked on this material in preparation\u000d\u000a      for further training of those who would eventually be doing the training.\u000d\u000a      Guy Cross writes, `We expect the KUF Prison System training to be...\u000d\u000a      rolled out nationally over the coming years... One of the potential values\u000d\u000a      of Dr Pickard's training is its capacity to address directly the natural\u000d\u000a      tendency to blame offenders for criminal and\/or problematic behaviour that\u000d\u000a      staff need to manage within the prison system, and the anti-rehabilitative\u000d\u000a      effect that blame has'[1].\u000d\u000a    (ii) Other Impacts on Public Policy\u000d\u000a    Dr Pickard's work on responsibility has attracted attention in other\u000d\u000a      ways. In 2013, she was invited to become a member of the National Mental\u000d\u000a      Health Development and Policy Innovation Group Initiative. This is a\u000d\u000a      collaborative venture by the Department of Health, the Institute for\u000d\u000a      Mental Health at the University of Nottingham, and the Centre for Mental\u000d\u000a      Health, to create policy in connection with mental health. In 2013, Dr\u000d\u000a      Pickard also spoke at the International Association of Forensic\u000d\u000a      Psychotherapy Workshop on Treating Evil. Later in the same year, she\u000d\u000a      spoke, at the invitation of the Governor, at the Grendon Annual Forum to\u000d\u000a      around eighty officers, prisoners, and policy makers. The Governer\u000d\u000a      subsequently invited her to write an article on responsibility without\u000d\u000a      blame for the Prison Service Journal in light of how well her\u000d\u000a      presentation had been received.\u000d\u000a    Dr Pickard's work has also received attention by those concerned with\u000d\u000a      drug laws and clinicians. Her paper `The Purpose of Chronic Addiction' is\u000d\u000a      cited as recommended reading by the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation[i],\u000d\u000a      and her ideas are discussed in Mirror of Justice, a blog dedicated\u000d\u000a      to the development of Catholic legal theory[ii]. Hilary\u000d\u000a      Richards, a graduate student in the School of Social Work at Wayne State\u000d\u000a      University, having consulted `The Purpose of Chronic Addiction' while\u000d\u000a      finishing her clinical internship at a residential substance abuse\u000d\u000a      treatment facility, wrote to her saying, `[This] outstanding article...\u000d\u000a      has broadened my understanding and perspective on addiction, which I\u000d\u000a      believe will improve my clinical approach in the field of substance\u000d\u000a      abuse.'[3]\u000d\u000a    In 2011, Dr Foddy was invited to participate in a seminar on `Ethics and\u000d\u000a      Behaviour Change' in the House of Lords. His evidence was subsequently\u000d\u000a      cited in a report of the House of Lords Science and Technology Select\u000d\u000a      Committee, which stated, in the context of the citation, `Witnesses who\u000d\u000a      gave evidence to us agreed that the behaviours which lead to obesity are a\u000d\u000a      consequence of a number of interacting influences working at various\u000d\u000a      levels... and involving social and environmental factors'[iii].\u000d\u000a      In 2011, Dr Foddy also gave a talk at 'Develop Liverpool', a conference\u000d\u000a      for videogame developers, on videogame addiction[iv].\u000d\u000a      This talk was subsequently reported in the popular computer and video game\u000d\u000a      magazine Edge and on the website of Videogamer.com, where\u000d\u000a      there was an accompanying interview with Dr Foddy. Later there were two\u000d\u000a      blog posts, in which participants discussed his findings and applied his\u000d\u000a      analysis to their own experiences of video game addiction.\u000d\u000a    The research has also attracted the attention of international\u000d\u000a      organisations concerned with addictions. In a background document for the\u000d\u000a      third meeting of the Technical Development Group for the World Health\u000d\u000a      Organization `Guidelines of Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacotherapy of\u000d\u000a      Opioid Dependence', Adrian Carter cites Dr Foddy's and Professor\u000d\u000a      Savulescu's article `Addiction and Autonomy' and adverts to the misleading\u000d\u000a      picture of addicts as `internally coerced by an irresistible force' (p.\u000d\u000a      25)[v]. The Food Addiction Institute, an independent\u000d\u000a      non-profit organisation whose mission is to support the healing of all\u000d\u000a      food addicts, cites Dr Foddy's and Professor Savulescu's article\u000d\u000a      `Addiction is not an Affliction' in its `Bibliography on the Science and\u000d\u000a      Treatment of Food Addiction'[vi]. And an article in Psychiatric\u000a        Times, a news resource aimed at clinicians, cites their article `A\u000d\u000a      Liberal Account of Addiction' and discusses the idea that psychiatry is\u000d\u000a      sometimes vitiated by a suspect normative element [vii].\u000d\u000a    (iii) Blog Discussions and Other Exposure for the Research\u000d\u000a    The research has also given rise to several active on-line blogs and\u000d\u000a      discussion threads[viii]. These include the\u000d\u000a      `Conversation Blog', which to date has had 63 comments, 189 Facebook Likes\u000d\u000a      and 64 tweets. Dr Simon Rippon, whilst a Fellow of the Uehiro Centre,\u000d\u000a      further promoted this research on `Practical Ethics', where he initiated a\u000d\u000a      debate on whether drug addiction is a lifestyle choice: this has so far\u000d\u000a      had nearly 1700 views, of which over 1400 were unique.

They\u000d\u000a      have sought to overturn a number of commonly held convictions about the\u000d\u000a      scope and limits of human responsibility.\u000d\u000a    A 2006 article by Dr Bennett Foddy and Professor Julian Savulescu\u000d\u000a      entitled `Addiction and Autonomy' challenges the commonsense view that the\u000d\u000a      autonomy of drug addicts is somehow compromised when they are choosing\u000d\u000a      whether or not to take their drug of addiction. The authors use both\u000d\u000a      empirical and conceptual considerations to counter this view, arguing that\u000d\u000a      an addictive desire is simply a very strong appetitive desire, on a par\u000d\u000a      with hunger or thirst. This has practical repercussions for how far we are\u000d\u000a      justified in protecting addicts by criminalizing the use of drugs. It also\u000d\u000a      calls into question the idea that addiction is some kind of disease. This\u000d\u000a      idea comes under further attack in a later joint article of theirs\u000d\u000a      published in 2007, `Addiction is not an Affliction', and in Dr Foddy's\u000d\u000a      2011 article, `Addiction and its Sciences'. In the former, the authors\u000d\u000a      argue that addiction is not a moral condition either, on the grounds that\u000d\u000a      the most that can be said about it in evaluative terms is that addictive\u000d\u000a      desires tend to be socially unacceptable for one reason or another. In a\u000d\u000a      third joint article published in 2010, `A Liberal Account of Addiction',\u000d\u000a      they identify a normative bias in the commonsense view of addiction that\u000d\u000a      they oppose.\u000d\u000a    Given the subsumption of addictive desires under appetitive desires, it\u000d\u000a      is natural to ask what potential there is for other appetitive desires to\u000d\u000a      become addictive. In `Addicted to Food, Hungry for Drugs', published in\u000d\u000a      2011, Dr Foddy identifies the desire for food as a case in point. He\u000d\u000a      argues that many cases of obesity have food addiction at their foundation.\u000d\u000a      He concludes his article by assessing some of the implications that his\u000d\u000a      argument has for policy and ethics.\u000d\u000a    In Dr Hanna Pickard's work on addiction, exemplified in her two articles\u000d\u000a      `The Instrumental Rationality of Addiction' and `The Purpose in Chronic\u000d\u000a      Addiction', published in 2011 and 2012 respectively, she takes up some\u000d\u000a      related issues about addictive drug use. She too combats the view of\u000d\u000a      addiction as a disease. One of her foci is the purpose served by drug use,\u000d\u000a      which is typically to alleviate severe psychological distress. This helps\u000d\u000a      her to characterize drug use as a chosen means to a rationally desired\u000d\u000a      end. Dr Pickard concludes her article by drawing some lessons for future\u000d\u000a      research and for effective treatment.\u000d\u000a    In `Responsibility Without Blame', published in 2011, Dr Pickard turns to\u000d\u000a      some different and somewhat broader issues about the nature of\u000d\u000a      responsibility. She argues that, in the case of many patients with\u000d\u000a      harm-causing personality disorders, encouraging them to take\u000d\u000a      responsibility for their actions is crucial to treating them, whereas\u000d\u000a      blaming them is detrimental to doing so. This raises the question of how\u000d\u000a      they can be held responsible without being blamed. Her answer is partly\u000d\u000a      conceptual and partly practical. It involves a distinction between two\u000d\u000a      sorts of blame: `detached' blame, in which judgements are directed at\u000d\u000a      actions, and `affective' blame, in which emotive responses are directed at\u000d\u000a      agents. It is only the latter, she argues, that is detrimental to treating\u000d\u000a      these patients. But the latter can be avoided by focusing on the patients'\u000d\u000a      past histories and coming to an empathetic understanding of the patients\u000d\u000a      while still holding them responsible for what they have done.\u000d\u000a    Professor Savulescu has been the Director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for\u000d\u000a      Practical Ethics (sponsored by the Uehiro Foundation) since 2002.

In\u000a      2010, he organised a workshop entitled `Human Enhancement and Genetic\u000a      Selection', at St Cross College Oxford, for the Norwegian Directorate of\u000a      Health, which is responsible for applying and interpreting laws and\u000a      regulations in the health and care sector in Norway. The NDH requested\u000a      that this workshop be held for its National Bioethics Advisory Committee\u000a      and for representatives from its advisory group, the former comprising\u000a      experts in medicine, law, and science, the latter comprising staff from\u000a      universities and university clinics with expertise in these fields and in\u000a      bioethics. In a subsequent e-mail to Professor Savulescu, Anne Forus, a\u000a      senior adviser, wrote: `Our group found the visit in Oxford and the\u000a      discussion with you and your research fellows very inspiring... The main\u000a      impact for the further work of our group, i.e. in our evaluation on the\u000a      Norwegian Act on medicinal use of biotechnology, has been the approach\u000a      your group presented for dealing with ethical challenges. This has been\u000a      taken on board in our further wor' [1].\u000a    Later that year, Professor Savulescu's joint article `Synthetic Biology\u000a      and the Ethics of Knowledge' was cited in The U.S. Presidential\u000a        Commission on Bioethics Briefing Book[i]. This\u000a      commission was to consider the scientific, social, and moral implications\u000a      of new biotechnological developments. The book states, in the context of\u000a      the citation, that, after careful deliberation, the Commission, in line\u000a      with Professor Savulescu, `was not persuaded by concerns that synthetic\u000a      biology fails to respect the proper relationship between humans and\u000a      nature'. It also refers, in the same context, to `the challenges of\u000a      defining \"nature\" or \"natural\" in this context, particularly in light of\u000a      humans' long history interacting with and affecting other species,\u000a      humankind, and the environment.' The same article was also cited in a\u000a      subsequent report of The U.S. Presidential Commission for the Study of\u000a        Bioethical Issues, this time to help counter concerns that the\u000a      creation of new organisms could have unexpected adverse consequences.\u000a    Professor Savulescu gave two lectures at the Australian Leadership\u000a      Retreat in Queensland in 2010[ii]. This retreat is a\u000a      unique, invitation-only forum for leaders in the business, political, and\u000a      academic communities to exchange ideas about Australia's defining\u000a      challenges. Professor Savulescu urged the case for human enhancement, and\u000a      was cited in the subsequent report as exploring `a new dimension to\u000a      individual resilience'. The report went on to state that `a resilient\u000a      society must continuously adapt to its environment' and, in the light of\u000a      Professor Savulescu's arguments among others, considered ways in which\u000a      Australia's healthcare stands in urgent need of reform.\u000a    (ii) Impact on Business and Industry\u000a      In 2010, Professor Savulescu delivered the keynote speech at a conference\u000a      entitled `Human Enhancement&#8212;Biotechnology in Sports', in Oslo, organised\u000a      by The Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board in collaboration with\u000a      Anti-Doping Norway: this conference was held for the benefit of athletes,\u000a      scientists, trainers, and the general public. His views have been sought\u000a      more generally by business and industry: for example, he has spoken to\u000a      several programmes at the Said Business School in Oxford, including more\u000a      than one programme for the State Farm Insurance Company and one for\u000a      SABMiller, and he has addressed a workshop led by Richard Branson on\u000a      Necker Island in 2011.\u000a    (iii) Impact Through Teaching Material and Through Engagement With the\u000a        Public\u000a      Professor Savulescu has made his ideas available through participation in\u000a      events at the London Science Museum and the Wellcome Collection: in the\u000a      latter case, an online talk of his is available on their website[iii].\u000a      The Wellcome Collection has also produced teaching resources, designed for\u000a      secondary school pupils, in which extensive use is made of his ideas[iv].\u000a      His work has been disseminated through books, journal and newspaper\u000a      articles, public lectures, podcasts, and media performances (including an\u000a      appearance on the BBC's Moral Maze in 2008 and a 2010 interview by\u000a      Richard Dawkins for BBC Radio 4's `The Age of the Genome', a very\u000a      high-profile three part series presented by Dawkins about the science of\u000a      genomes and resulting ethical issues). There were several national\u000a      newspaper and on-line media reports on a conference entitled `Science,\u000a      Ethics and Policy Challenges of Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Gametes'\u000a      that Professor Savulescu organised in Hinxton in April 2008[v].\u000a      Recognition of Professor Savulescu's position at the forefront of public\u000a      debate in this field was indicated by his selection as winner of the\u000a      `Thinkers' category of The Weekend Australian's top one hundred\u000a      Emerging Leaders awards in May 2009: this list is devised as a list of\u000a      Australians who are on the rise or newly established in roles of influence\u000a      and leadership[vi]. His ideas were discussed in the Sunday\u000a        Herald Sun in 2011[vii]. All of this has\u000a      contributed to the public awareness of the various questions that he has\u000a      addressed and the various ideas that he has advanced.\u000a    The public has had all sorts of opportunities to register its engagement\u000a      with Professor Savulescu's ideas. In 2010, he led the University of Oxford\u000a      Online Debate proposing the motion: `Performance enhancing drugs should be\u000a      allowed in sport'[viii]. The debate proved very popular,\u000a      with around 7500 visits, and the public posted comments throughout the\u000a      debate which closed with a public vote (18% in favour, 82% against). He\u000a      also contributed to the `Intelligence Squared Debate', first in New York\u000a      in 2008, then in London in 2009 (this appeared on YouTube), and finally in\u000a      Sydney in 2012[ix]. The last of these debates involved a\u000a      pre- and post-debate poll of the audience's opinion on whether there is\u000a      anything wrong with designer babies. There was a shift from 19.9% in\u000a      favour of Professor Savulescu's view, 36.7% undecided, and 43.3% against,\u000a      to 47% in favour, 10% undecided, and 43% against. There was a similar pre- and\u000a\u0009  post-debate poll after a debate on whether it is acceptable for\u000a      athletes to take performance-enhancing drugs, broadcast as the `IQ2'\u000a      debate on ABC and on BBC World, to which Professor Savulescu contributed[x].\u000a      This time there was a shift from 17.4% in favour of his view, 17.3%\u000a      undecided, and 65.3% against, to 33.5% in favour, 6.7% undecided, and\u000a      59.7% against.\u000a    Several of Professor Savulescu's newspaper and journal articles, in which\u000a      he summarizes his views, have been accompanied by extensive online blogs\u000a      debating the views[xi]. Examples include: a 2012 New\u000a        York Times opinion piece on doping; a 2012 New Scientist\u000a      article, written jointly with Anders Sandberg, on enhancing love; and a\u000a      2012 article in Australia's The Punch on gene selection (the blog\u000a      in this case attracted nearly 150 comments). Similar debate followed\u000a      extensive reference to his views in an article by Ian Steadman in Wired\u000a      in 2012 and a feature on his views in The Huffington Post in 2012.\u000a      Professor Savulescu also has over 1600 followers on Twitter, where he\u000a      engages with the general public in discussion of his views.\u000a    Among the highly distinguished public lectures and other public\u000a      presentations that Professor Savulescu has given on these issues are: a\u000a      contribution to the debate `Do We Have the Right to Improve Upon Human\u000a      Nature?' at the Smith Foundation, in New York, in 2008; two lectures at\u000a      the World Economic Forum in Davos, in 2009; the Fulvio Guerrini lecture in\u000a      Torino, in 2009; a lecture to the Royal Institution in London, in 2009; a\u000a      lecture at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas in Sydney, in 2009; a lecture\u000a      to Consilium 2010, a Davos-style event for business and political leaders\u000a      in Queensland, in 2010; a keynote address at `Visionary Education 2010'\u000a      and participation in a subsequent public seminar, in Melbourne, in 2010;\u000a      and a keynote address at `The Posthuman Condition', at Aarhus University,\u000a      in 2010.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    For over a decade, Professor Julian Savulescu has produced a body of work\u000a      on the enhancement of human beings and its ethical implications, including\u000a      work on the ethics of genetic selection and on the ethics of using\u000a      technology to enhance human capacities.

In the former case, his focus has\u000a      been on the use of genetic selection to enable parents to have children\u000a      with the best prospects of the best life: he coined the term `procreative\u000a      beneficence', which is now widespread in the literature. In the latter\u000a      case, his primary focus has been on the use of biotechnology to enhance\u000a      human cognitive capacities. One issue that he has addressed, in his 2002\u000a      article `The Embryonic Stem Cell Lottery and the Cannibalization of Human\u000a      Beings', is the ethics of embryonic stem research. In this article he\u000a      argued that, even if an embryo is a person, that fact alone does not mean\u000a      that there can be no justification for killing it.\u000a    Although Professor Savulescu has been especially concerned with the\u000a      enhancement of people's cognitive capacities, his more recent work,\u000a      particularly as represented in his 2009 article `Genetic Enhancement' and\u000a      in the volumes Human Enhancement and Enhancing Human\u000a        Capacities that he co-edited in 2009 and 2011, has also been\u000a      concerned with the enhancement of people's physical capacities (e.g.\u000a      through doping in sport), the enhancement of their moods, and the\u000a      enhancement of their relationships; and indeed there is now an emphasis,\u000a      most prominent in his 2008 article `The Perils of Cognitive Enhancement\u000a      and the Urgent Imperative to Enhance the Moral Character of Humanity' and\u000a      in his co-authored 2012 book Unfit for the Future, on people's\u000a      moral enhancement.\u000a    While some ethicists had previously argued that all these forms of\u000a      enhancing human beings were morally permissible, Professor Savulescu was\u000a      the first to argue that they are not only morally permissible, but morally\u000a      obligatory. It is this key idea that has attracted the most attention. The\u000a      recent emphasis on people's moral enhancement has been a natural\u000a      development of his earlier work. This is because other forms of\u000a      enhancement, in common with technological advances of other kinds, have\u000a      opened up possibilities of evil, including large-scale evil with\u000a      catastrophic effects; and they are likely to continue to do so at an\u000a      exponential rate, as discussed in his joint 2010 article `Synthetic\u000a      Biology and the Ethics of Knowledge'. Professor Savulescu has argued that\u000a      it is thus imperative that we try to ensure that research into moral\u000a      enhancement keeps pace with research into these other kinds of\u000a      enhancement&#8212;not least because, though there is good reason to believe that\u000a      moral enhancement by biomedical and genetic means is possible in\u000a      principle, in practice it remains a distant prospect.\u000a    Professor Savulescu has carried out his research in his capacity as the\u000a      Director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics (sponsored by\u000a      the Uehiro Foundation), a position that he took up in 2002.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4873","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Broome's work has attracted a good deal of attention among\u000d\u000a      individuals and organisations already concerned with climate change, as\u000d\u000a      well as bringing others to a fresh concern with it. His work has also been\u000d\u000a      used to shape policy.\u000d\u000a    (i) Work for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u000d\u000a      Most notably, Professor Broome was invited to serve as Lead Author for\u000d\u000a      Working Group III of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental\u000d\u000a      Panel on Climate Change, the leading international body for the assessment\u000d\u000a      of climate change. This invitation came in 2010 from Ottmar Edenhofer, the\u000d\u000a      Chairman of Working Group III, who was familiar with some of Professor\u000d\u000a      Broome's work on climate change. (Professor Broome was told informally\u000d\u000a      that the subsequent invitation to become a member of the IPCC's Synthesis\u000d\u000a      Report, where he serves as the only philosopher - an invitation that\u000d\u000a      likewise came from Ottmar Edenhofer - was driven by a conviction that the\u000d\u000a      scientific issues of climate change are now less pressing than the ethical\u000d\u000a      issues.) The report is intended for policy-makers, and it will include the\u000d\u000a      application of theory taken from Professor Broome's book Weighing\u000d\u000a        Lives. Professor Broome's first involvement with this report was to\u000d\u000a      take part in a preliminary meeting of authors for Working Groups II and\u000d\u000a      III, where he was on the scientific steering committee and chaired two\u000d\u000a      sessions: this meeting was designed `to support ongoing AR5 [Fifth\u000d\u000a      Assessment Report] efforts and promote coordination across AR5 author\u000d\u000a      teams..., [by summarising] the body of knowledge and [highlighting] key\u000d\u000a      issues related to this important set of topics [i.e. topics concerning\u000d\u000a      climate change].'[i] An early draft of the report\u000d\u000a      appeared in the late spring of 2013 and received extensive comments from\u000d\u000a      government officials. Professor Broome's research assistant Dr Levy, who\u000d\u000a      provides commentary on material drafted by Professor Broome for the IPCC,\u000d\u000a      has himself now been invited to act as an expert reviewer of other IPCC\u000d\u000a      reports.\u000d\u000a    (ii) Raising Awareness of the Issues\u000d\u000a      In 2012, Professor Broome spoke at a public policy conference in Austria,\u000d\u000a      organised by Joanneum Research, a research institute involved in public\u000d\u000a      policy research owned by the Austrian state of Styria. This was attended\u000d\u000a      both by members of the public and by public policy makers. Professor\u000d\u000a      Broome has also given many lectures beyond academia about climate change.\u000d\u000a      One of these was to the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences in 2008 (and was\u000d\u000a      attended by the King and Crown Princess). In 2009, he gave a talk on\u000d\u000a      Ethics and Public Policy, by video link, to a large conference in\u000d\u000a      Wellington that consisted mostly of public policy makers, but also\u000d\u000a      included a large number of civil servants. He also gave a talk to the\u000d\u000a      University of Toronto, after which finance columnist Ellen Roseman wrote\u000d\u000a      in The Star, a Canadian newspaper, `My head was exploding after\u000d\u000a      Professor Broome's lecture. And I realized why I was attracted to\u000d\u000a      philosophy - because of the fundamental questions it tries to address and\u000d\u000a      the reasoned debate it encourages.'[ii] He gave a Tanner\u000d\u000a      Lecture on the topic, open to members of the public, at the University of\u000d\u000a      Michigan in 2012. Later in 2012 Professor Broome gave talks at the UK\u000d\u000a      Treasury and the World Bank. For the former he used feedback forms, and\u000d\u000a      Fayyaz Muneer, organiser of the talk, commented, `I now know to\u000d\u000a      distinguish between good solutions and just solutions... I will also think\u000d\u000a      more carefully about what we owe to future generations... I'll be arguing\u000d\u000a      with people differently now.'[1] Other comments, all\u000d\u000a      from employees of the Treasury, included the following: `The talk offered\u000d\u000a      a new method of dealing with climate change...

Towards the end of 2012, he gave a talk in Oslo\u000d\u000a      organised by the Oxford University Norway Society and attended by the UK\u000d\u000a      Ambassador to Norway, Jane Owen.

It is cited in\u000d\u000a      several national government policy statements. For instance, the UK\u000d\u000a      Treasury wrote in its 2008 `action plan' on sustainable development that\u000d\u000a      `the Treasury will continue to propagate the findings of the Stern review\u000d\u000a      internationally and to use it as a basis for domestic actions to reduce\u000d\u000a      greenhouse gas emissions'[xii], and in its 2010 report\u000d\u000a      `Climate Plan', it adopts the review's main aims [xiii].\u000d\u000a      The Australian government, in its 2011 `Climate Change Plan', advocates\u000d\u000a      taking action to combat climate change with an extensive quotation from\u000d\u000a      the Stern review that concludes: `Tackling climate change is the\u000d\u000a      pro-growth strategy for the longer term, and it can be done in a way that\u000d\u000a      does not cap the aspirations for growth of rich or poor countries.

Since 2000, he has used a series of publications to\u000d\u000a      explore these questions in greater depth and to consider some of their\u000d\u000a      practical repercussions. In 2004, he published his seminal book Weighing\u000a        Lives. In this book, he reminds us how, both as individuals and as\u000d\u000a      societies, we are faced with choices that involve the weighing of people's\u000d\u000a      lives, sometimes against one another, sometimes against other goods.\u000d\u000a      Climate change introduces just such choices. This makes the question of\u000d\u000a      how we should weigh lives unavoidable. Professor Broome draws on precise\u000d\u000a      methods from economics in an attempt to develop a theoretical basis for\u000d\u000a      answering this question. In the course of doing so, he engages with the\u000d\u000a      intuition that changing the size of the world's population is, in itself,\u000d\u000a      neither good nor bad, and argues that this intuition is unsustainable in\u000d\u000a      any coherent theory of value. He further develops this argument in his\u000d\u000a      2005 article `Should We Value Population?', and points out the serious\u000d\u000a      problem that it poses for evaluating policies in response to global\u000d\u000a      warming - the point being that these policies are bound to have an effect\u000d\u000a      on the size of the world's overall diachronic population.\u000d\u000a    At around the same time as he wrote this article, Professor Broome also\u000d\u000a      wrote an article entitled `Valuing Policies in Response to Climate\u000d\u000a      Change', which helped to inform the Stern Review of the Economics of\u000d\u000a      Climate Change. In this article, Professor Broome confronts the question\u000d\u000a      of whether the well-being of future people can properly be discounted in\u000d\u000a      our current deliberations and urges that there are no convincing grounds\u000d\u000a      for thinking so.\u000d\u000a    In a Scientific American article in 2008, he introduces a\u000d\u000a      significant further twist to these considerations. Having argued that\u000d\u000a      future generations will suffer most from the harmful effects of global\u000d\u000a      climate change, he goes on to point out that, if the world economy grows,\u000d\u000a      they will be richer than we now are. This further complicates the choices\u000d\u000a      that we currently face. For it means that we must enlist the help of\u000d\u000a      expert economists to decide whether to use aggressive means to reduce the\u000d\u000a      chances of future harm or to let our possibly much richer future\u000d\u000a      descendants fend for themselves. The economists in turn will have to make\u000d\u000a      ethical decisions in formulating their advice. Even the tiny chance that\u000d\u000a      utter catastrophe will ensue from global warming means that they will have\u000d\u000a      to decide how to factor in that possibility, and this is, on Professor\u000d\u000a      Broome's account, a largely ethical decision, which returns us to some of\u000d\u000a      the difficult questions raised earlier about the value of people's\u000d\u000a      existing at all.\u000d\u000a    In `The Most Important Thing About Climate Change', which appeared in\u000d\u000a      2010, Professor Broome points out that we now have the wherewithal to\u000d\u000a      solve the problem of climate change without making any sacrifice. For we\u000d\u000a      can both reduce our profligate emission of greenhouse gases and compensate\u000d\u000a      ourselves in various ways for doing so. It would nevertheless be far\u000d\u000a      better, he argues, for us to do what the Stern Review advocated, namely\u000d\u000a      reduce our emissions without compensation, by sacrificially\u000d\u000a      redistributing wealth from present people to future people. In the light\u000d\u000a      of this, Professor Broome proposes various courses of action - reminding\u000d\u000a      us that there is a degree of urgency here which means we must act before\u000d\u000a      fully and satisfactorily addressing all of the ethical issues involved.\u000d\u000a    Professor Broome has been the White's Professor of Moral Philosophy in\u000d\u000a      the University of Oxford since 2000. He also has a research assistant, Dr\u000d\u000a      Yair Levy, who is employed on grants from the British Academy and John\u000d\u000a      Fell Fund, and who carries out his own background research on the ethics\u000d\u000a      and economics of climate change on which Professor Broome has been able to\u000d\u000a      draw.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5763","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Loughlin's research has had a major impact within the healthcare\u000a      community, influencing the\u000a      thinking of practitioners, service-users and the broader public. It has\u000a      been instrumental in enabling\u000a      an appreciation of the philosophical limitations of EBM, making an\u000a      important contribution to the\u000a      emergence of EIM (allowing practitioners and academics to consider\u000a      different ways of framing\u000a      practical problems); to the revival of the idea of Person-Centred Medicine\u000a      and a new dialogue\u000a      between traditional defenders of EBM and its critics - exemplified in the\u000a      debates between EBM-theorist Jeremy Howick and prominent practitioner and\u000a      EBM-critic Mark Tonelli, that Loughlin\u000a      organised as editor of the JECP philosophy-thematic issues. (Tonelli, a\u000a      major force in medical\u000a      education in the USA, credits Loughlin's \"original work and commentary\" as\u000a      having \"been central in\u000a      forcing the evolution of EBM over the last two decades\" and he notes that\u000a      Loughlin \"has been\u000a      instrumental in shining the bright light of philosophical analysis upon\u000a      the assumptions underlying\u000a      the EBM movement, revealing the poorly constructed framework for a claim\u000a      that the results of\u000a      clinical research should be prescriptive in the care of individual\u000a      patients\". This work has been of\u000a      benefit to practice because \"Very few philosophers have both the\u000a      willingness and the ability to take\u000a      their case to the right audience, often people who feel they have very\u000a      little use for philosophy. But\u000a      for ideas and arguments to matter, they need to be presented to those with\u000a      the ability to make\u000a      change.\") The underpinning research is embedded in the impact activities.\u000a      By linking the debates\u000a      about EBM with the quality movement and other policy initiatives, Loughlin\u000a      has \"at once located the\u000a      issues beyond medicine while showing their impact at the daily level of\u000a      clinical practice\" [C]This\u000a      work has been characterised as an \"international level intervention\"\u000a      benefitting patients and\u000a      practitioners by moving the debate about practice away from \"the framework\u000a      of scientistic\u000a      reductionism\" to one framed by the significance of the personhood of both\u000a      parties to the clinical\u000a      encounter [A].

As such\u000a      the work has had \"unprecedented\u000a      influence across many health professions and academic disciplines\u000a      achieving both inter-professional and trans-disciplinary significance\" [D]\u000a    Loughlin has been committed to disseminating his research beyond the\u000a      community of\u000a      philosophers, communicating ideas and arguments to practitioners through\u000a      healthcare journals,\u000a      conferences and addresses to professional bodies. During this Impact\u000a      period he has presented\u000a      more than 40 papers at conferences and professional gatherings, to groups\u000a      as diverse as dentists,\u000a      psychiatrists, social workers, NHS quality-improvement organisations,\u000a      osteopaths, educationalists,\u000a      GPs and construction managers.

He was invited to\u000a      give a major address to the prestigious Istituto Superiore di Sanita\u000a      in Rome, to an audience\u000a      including a diverse range of senior health staff and officials, where\u000a      fellow speakers included the\u000a      Head of the Italian Cochrane Association (later published as [3]).\u000a      He persuaded the British\u000a      Association for the study of Community Dentistry to reject\u000a      (overwhelmingly) the motion that quality-\u000a      of-life measures should provide the basis for commissioning local dental\u000a      services in the UK, in a\u000a      head-to-head debate with a leading designer of dental QoL measures (debate\u000a      hosted by the Royal\u000a      College of Physicians). On the basis of this presentation he was invited\u000a      to assist the Royal College\u000a      of Surgeons in designing and delivering its postgraduate programmes on\u000a      health policy and\u000a      leadership, and his work is credited with having \"stimulated debate,\u000a      helped clarify thinking and in\u000a      doing so, helped advance healthcare policy at numerous levels\" [B].\u000a      He has reached a wider,\u000a      public audience by giving radio interviews and writing for more populist\u000a      publications than the\u000a      academic journals cited above, including the Times Higher Education\u000a        Supplement (full page\u000a      article),The Philosophers Magazine and the online Scope\u000a        Magazine on the need for a proper\u000a      philosophical understanding of our current professional, health and social\u000a      problems.\u000a    Loughlin has made a significant impact on scholarship at the British\u000a      School of Osteopathy (BSO)\u000a      and through that institution, the osteopathic profession. The starting\u000a      point in the early 90s was the\u000a      supervision of Stephen Tyreman's PhD thesis, which applied philosophical\u000a      analysis to osteopathic\u000a      practice to elucidate the meaning of key ideas within osteopathy. This,\u000a      the first doctoral-level work\u000a      to come out of osteopathy, was then used to develop the undergraduate\u000a      degree. (Stephen\u000a      Tyreman, is now a Professor and Dean of Osteopathic Education Development,\u000a      and also Course\u000a      Leader for the Professional Doctorate in Osteopathy (Validated by\u000a      University of Bedfordshire) at\u000a      the British School of Osteopathy in London.) Since then Loughlin has\u000a      continued to be involved with\u000a      the BSO as an external examiner, where he supported the integration of\u000a      philosophy into the pre-\u000a      registration qualification award. He later was a visiting contributor to\u000a      postgraduate programmes,\u000a      where he supported the development of critical analytical thinking and\u000a      more recently he has made\u000a      a major contribution to the new Professional Doctorate programme in\u000a      Osteopathy. His work on the\u000a      limits of scientism [6] has been included in this doctoral\u000a      programme and forms the basis for a\u000a      defence of osteopathic understandings of evidence in the wake of renewed\u000a      attacks on the\u000a      discipline from EBM-protagonists.\u000a    As a result of his work Loughlin was invited in 2010 to co-author the\u000a      Policy Statement on Evidence\u000a      for the Science Advisory Council of the College of Medicine, a version of\u000a      which is on its website\u000a      and summarised in its launch document: http:\/\/www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk.\u000a      (He is the only\u000a      philosopher to have been invited to join its Scientific Advisory\u000a      Committee.) Loughlin is a regular\u000a      contributor to the postgraduate programmes in the Faculty of General\u000a      Dental Practice in the Royal\u000a      College of Surgeons, and has helped develop postgraduate provisions for\u000a      health professionals in\u000a      London, Bath and Buckingham, where he was awarded the title of Visiting\u000a      Professor in Philosophy\u000a      as Applied to Medicine, and addressed international audiences of\u000a      postgraduate medical students.\u000a    He has long-standing links with many organisations working in health and\u000a      social care. In 2011 he\u000a      addressed European Association of Schools of Social Work conference on\u000a      ethical reasoning in the\u000a      context of an irrational world, discussing the migration of the concept of\u000a      `Evidence-based practice'\u000a      from its origins in medicine to such areas as social work practice.

In 2013 he addressed an\u000a      international conference for health\u000a      professionals, policy-makers and researchers in Geneva, organised by the\u000a      Network .

The research\u000a      underpinning this case study is his work exemplifying and promoting\u000a      methods of analysis derived\u000a      from philosophy to clarify complex problems of policy and practice,\u000a      addressing foundational\u000a      questions about management, professional ethics, moral education, research\u000a      methodology (in\u000a      applied philosophy and social science), and the relationship between\u000a      knowledge, judgement and\u000a      evidence in medicine. A core philosophical concern in his work is the\u000a      centrality of the normative in\u000a      all practical discussion. Discussion of professional practice aims to\u000a      produce evaluative\u000a      conclusions, regarding what persons (acting in professional capacities) should\u000a      do. Yet background\u000a      assumptions associated with scientism cause us to search for impersonal\u000a      mechanisms, rather than\u000a      returning to discussions about intellectual and moral virtue, and what\u000a      makes a person a good\u000a      decision-maker in specific instances.\u000a    From January 1993 to date, Loughlin has published a large number of\u000a      influential essays in highly\u000a      esteemed international professional\/medical journals including: Health\u000a        Care Analysis; The Journal\u000a        of Evaluation in Clinical Practice (JECP); Journal of Medical\u000a        Ethics;Philosophy, Psychiatry and\u000a        Psychology;Philosophy of Management; European Journal of\u000a        Person-Centered Healthcare. He co-authored the influential\u000a      editorials of the JECP's widely read annual `EBM-thematic' issues (widely\u000a      credited with being the focus for developing an alternative approach to\u000a      EBM) from 2006 to 2011 - his other co-authors being senior medical\u000a      researchers and practitioners. The most recent of these\u000a      much-cited editorials argued for a move from EBM to Evidence-Informed\u000a      Medicine (EIM). In 2010\u000a      he edited the first ever thematic issue of a primarily clinical journal\u000a      devoted entirely to the\u000a      philosophy of medicine, discussing the nature of evidence, clinical\u000a      judgment and broader questions\u000a      of medical epistemology. On publication of the fourth of these\u000a      internationally acclaimed JECP\u000a      `philosophy-thematics', including papers on virtue epistemology and its\u000a      applications to clinical\u000a      reasoning, he was appointed Associate Editor of the journal, making him\u000a      one of the few\u000a      philosophers in the world to occupy so senior a role in a major clinical\u000a      journal.\u000a    In 2002 he published a monograph, Ethics, Management and Mythology\u000a      [1]. This study criticised\u000a      the role of management theory in undermining professional autonomy and\u000a      raised methodological\u000a      questions about quality measures, bioethics and the use of evidence in\u000a      health policy. It examined\u000a      the problems of applying scientific theory and methods to policy issues\u000a      and organisational\u000a      decision-making. Its criticisms of Total Quality Management and\u000a      Quality-of-Life measures\u000a      (employed by bodies such as the National Institute for Clinical\u000a      Excellence) provided the basis for\u000a      his 2001 address at LSE to launch the journal Philosophy of Management\u000a      (then Reason in\u000a        Practice) and were developed further in his 2004 article in the same\u000a      journal on `Management,\u000a      Science and Reality'.\u000a    A key concern is use of empirical data to establish normative conclusions\u000a      [4,5]. EBM's reliance on\u000a      statistical methods of analysis is logically inadequate to bridge the gap\u000a      between information and\u000a      evidence adequate to establish conclusions about the right course\u000a      of action in a specific and\u000a      potentially unique case [2, 3]. Approaches founded on unapologetic\u000a      discussion of the value of\u000a      medical practice place the concept of good judgement at the centre of\u000a      practical enquiry, rather than\u000a      relegating judgement to `opinion' with a low evidential status, as in\u000a      successive `evidence-hierarchies' [1,2,3,6]. The work on the limits\u000a      of scientific explanation [4,6] are also part of a broad\u000a      philosophical critique of scientism that informs opposition to\u000a      reductionist approaches such as EBM.\u000a    The background to the 2002 monograph [1] was the `Critique'\u000a      series of articles commissioned by\u000a      David Seedhouse when setting up the journal Health Care Analysis.\u000a      The aim of the series was to\u000a      take management and government documents regulating or `guiding' practice\u000a      in health areas, and\u000a      subject them to philosophical critique. On the basis of the reaction to\u000a      the series Loughlin was\u000a      invited to address professional groups, and Nigel Laurie invited him to\u000a      speak at the launch of the\u000a      journal now called Philosophy of Management and Andrew Miles\u000a      commissioned several articles for\u000a      the JECP. Miles is a major figure in the world of public health and runs a\u000a      number of international\u000a      organisations (including the European Society for Person-Centred\u000a      Healthcare). Loughlin joined\u000a      Miles and a group of practitioners and intellectuals including Ross\u000a      Upshur, Steven Buetow, Mona\u000a      Gupta and Mark Tonelli arguing against the then dominant EBM movement.\u000a      Loughlin co-authored\u000a      papers with them, and helped to organise and attended conferences to\u000a      disseminate the ideas to\u000a      practitioners.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6401","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Kieran has enriched the wider public understanding of artistic values\u000d\u000a      with his distinctive vision of the role of art in our lives.

This event\u000d\u000a        (including Professor Kieran's invaluable contribution) will help inform\u000d\u000a        the development of the Turning Point strategy as well as Pavilion's\u000d\u000a        curatorial thinking and artistic programme for the coming year.\" (F)\u000d\u000a    In 2010 Kieran was on the advisory panel of, and was an author for, the\u000d\u000a      Commission for Architecture and Built Environment public policy project\u000d\u000a      that measured the public's responses to beauty in the natural and built\u000d\u000a      environment and looked at the implications for planning. This generated\u000d\u000a      wider public debate and professional discussion including a Royal\u000d\u000a      Institute for Architecture conference involving architects, politicians\u000d\u000a      and policy makers. An essay commissioned from Kieran by the project, which\u000d\u000a      stressed the importance of beauty in everyday life and its connection to\u000d\u000a      practical motivations, was discussed in, for example, a Royal Society of\u000d\u000a      Arts commentary (http:\/\/www.thersa.org\/fellowship\/journal\/archive\/autumn-2010\/features\/on-beauty)\u000d\u000a      and the Planning Resource blog (http:\/\/planningblog.planningresource.co.uk\/2010\/11\/15\/defining-beauty\/).\u000a      (G)\u000d\u000a    Media coverage, Channel 4 documentary and Internet engagement\u000d\u000a      Kieran's work has had widespread impact, including interviews for the\u000d\u000a      BBC\/OU Ethics Bites podcast on his work on \"Art, Censorship and Morality\",\u000d\u000a      April 2008, and for national and international media, such as the Sunday\u000d\u000a        Times extended feature piece on `Censors and Sensibility' October 4th,\u000d\u000a      2009 and a feature piece in Le Monde, `L'Art Pervers' May 4th,\u000d\u000a      2013. He also talked on the Today programme, Radio 4, 13th April,\u000d\u000a      2012, on emotional transgression in Munch's Scream and has\u000d\u000a      published art criticism for The Philosopher's Magazine.\u000d\u000a    Such interviews helped establish a media presence and in 2011 - 2012\u000d\u000a      Kieran acted as the art consultant developing Channel 4's Hidden Talent\u000d\u000a      programme. Kieran's focus on the centrality of appreciators' skills and\u000d\u000a      capacities was reflected in the programme. He helped advise on\u000d\u000a      administering the Meier art test to over 1000 members of the public, which\u000d\u000a      led to the selection of the subject of the programme&#8212;Lee Yenson, a tractor\u000d\u000a      factory worker who had left school at 15. Kieran worked closely with\u000d\u000a      Yenson to develop his art appreciation skills, helped to devise the\u000d\u000a      relevant tests Lee had to overcome and explain to the audience what helps\u000d\u000a      to distinguish good from not so good or bad art. The impact on Yenson, who\u000d\u000a      had never entered an art gallery, was profound but the programme also\u000d\u000a      allowed Kieran's ideas to reach an audience of just under 2 million\u000d\u000a      viewers on 1st May, 2012. The programme attracted widespread\u000d\u000a      national and local media coverage. Kieran advised on YouTube videos\u000d\u000a      offering further advice to members of the public and helped design a\u000d\u000a      shortened version of the Meier test to go online to test the public's\u000d\u000a      artistic appreciation skills. The series producer said Kieran's thorough\u000d\u000a      approach and accessible style had \"encouraged many viewers to\u000d\u000a        participate in the online testing and explore art in a hugely accessible\u000d\u000a        arena.\" (H)\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Matthew Kieran's research focuses on the role that individual\u000d\u000a      motivations, skills and settled dispositions (i.e. someone's character)\u000d\u000a      actively play in artistic appreciation and creation.

Kieran (6) argued that a\u000d\u000a      judgment of a work to be obscene by an appreciator involves both aversion\u000d\u000a      and attraction as an upshot of character: aversion in going against the\u000d\u000a      appreciator's moral norms or dispositions and attraction in speaking to\u000d\u000a      other personal drives (such as certain sexual desires). Judging a work to\u000d\u000a      be obscene is thus in large part a function of how the work interacts with\u000d\u000a      an appreciator's moral and non-moral character. Kieran (5) then\u000d\u000a      went on to argue that an even wider range of works can be judged to be\u000d\u000a      morally problematic in ways that make them good as art. In particular an\u000d\u000a      appreciator's character can be challenged by morally problematic art in\u000d\u000a      ways that lead to insight through active appreciation (5). This\u000d\u000a      led to an invitation to write the monograph Revealing Art (4),\u000d\u000a      where Kieran argued that challenging works can be successful partly\u000d\u000a      because they get us to endorse or suspend attitudes in ways we are not\u000d\u000a      willing to in real life. Hence, whilst we may not admire Marat, be\u000d\u000a      sympathetic to certain forms of Christianity or endorse honour codes, in\u000d\u000a      actively appreciating David's Death of Marat, the Roettgen\u000d\u000a        Piet&#224; or the Iliad we may have much to learn about\u000d\u000a      ourselves. Indeed, Kieran (4) argues, this can be just as true of\u000d\u000a      pornographic art, which uses artistic techniques to arouse sexual\u000d\u000a      instincts and desires. Kieran (2) further expanded the account\u000d\u000a      regarding the role our emotions play in resisting, appreciating and\u000d\u000a      valuing morally troubling art. Emotionally troubling art, Kieran (2)\u000d\u000a      argues, often requires the appreciator to suspend judgement in exploring\u000d\u000a      what is taken to be morally problematic. Art that successfully gets good\u000d\u000a      appreciators to do this will often yield insight to people about\u000d\u000a      themselves or the world.\u000d\u000a    Whilst arguing that art may teach us about ourselves and the world (2,\u000a        4 and 5), Kieran (4) also argues for the claim that\u000d\u000a      art appreciation involves learning from art in a distinctive way, namely\u000d\u000a      through the cultivation of visual skills and mental capacities. Moreover,\u000d\u000a      Kieran (3) argues that part of what we should value about many art\u000d\u000a      works is a function of the imaginativeness, skill and creative character\u000d\u000a      of the artist. Most recently Kieran (1) has argued that good\u000d\u000a      appreciation and aesthetic creativity has to be driven by the right kind\u000d\u000a      of motivations to be most appropriate, reliable and rewarding. Where\u000d\u000a      someone is motivated by external goods such as money or social status,\u000d\u000a      appreciative activity (and often artistic judgement) will tend to be\u000d\u000a      impoverished (1). We should, rightly, be sceptical of appreciators\u000d\u000a      with a snobbish character and, just as importantly, look out for signs of\u000d\u000a      snobbishness in ourselves. Kieran's arguments here amount to the\u000d\u000a      development of a virtue approach to artistic appreciation and creativity -\u000d\u000a      putting character centre stage in the understanding of human engagement\u000d\u000a      with the arts.\u000d\u000a    Key Researcher:\u000d\u000a      Matthew Kieran (University of Leeds; Professor, 2009 - present;\u000d\u000a      Senior Lecturer, 2004 - 2009; Junior Lecturer, 1996 - 2004; Teaching\u000d\u000a      Fellow, 1994 - 1996)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6402","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our impact focuses on the role of habituation and organisational culture\u000a      in the development of individual good judgement which affectively\u000a      appreciates the significance of ethical reasons in professional life.\u000a    Our research has led to impactful changes on:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aprofessional bodies themselves, transforming their approach to\u000a        ethics from a mere statement of ethical codes to a focus on\u000a        quasi-experiential case study and training design, and on the contents\u000a        of ethics manuals; and via these,\u000a      \u000aindividual professional practice and good judgement.\u000a    \u000a    The impact has had considerable reach because of the size of the\u000a      professional bodies and organisations involved, and significance because\u000a      of the beneficial effect on the way individuals engage with ethics\u000a      training to develop good judgement, and in turn embed ethics in\u000a      professional life, as exemplified by the impact on the National Nuclear\u000a      Laboratory and the Leveson Inquiry. Examples include the following:\u000a    I. In engineering, the Royal Academy of Engineering's Ingenious\u000a      programme (2007-9) funded our development of training workshops to `bring\u000a      to life' the Academy's four ethical principles. The workshops helped\u000a      individuals to incorporate these in good judgement by creating case\u000a      studies, designed with practising engineers, that provided\u000a      quasi-experiential engagement with ethical issues to which the principles\u000a      applied. Approaching 150 attended from major firms (Amey, Arup, Jacobs\u000a      etc.) \"I enjoyed the case study and ethical interpretation of `lying'.\u000a        I will use what I have learned.\" \"Indeed it will impact my working life\u000a        and the decisions I will make in my profession\" (A)\u000a    The success of this quasi-experiential approach to `habituation' led to a\u000a      &#163;20,000 commission from the Institute of Engineering and Technology to\u000a      design web-based case studies that would help members to affectively\u000a      appreciate the significance of the principles of the IET's ethics code. On\u000a      average more than 800 members a month have visited the cases since January\u000a      2010. IET's Membership Manager commented: \"We wanted to provide a\u000a        support service for our members, who may face ethical dilemmas in an\u000a        engineering context ....We are absolutely delighted with the case\u000a        studies and judging by the web stats our members also greatly appreciate\u000a        the resource.\" (B)\u000a    Our approach was taken further through an invitation from the Royal\u000a      Academy of Engineering to develop its Guide to Ethics in Engineering\u000a        Practice. Aimed at all 350,000 UK engineers, this was launched in\u000a      September 2011 at a conference attended by 80 leaders in engineering.\u000a      13,000+ hits on the web version demonstrates regular usage. The Head of\u000a      Policy at the Academy commented: \"The IDEA CETL team has produced an\u000a        extremely useful set of case studies.... Professional engineers at all\u000a        stages of their career have found them thought provoking and important,\u000a        especially in the education and training of young engineers.\" (C)\u000a    These activities are also having significant impact on individual\u000a      engagement with ethics training and in turn on professional judgement. On\u000a      reading the Guide, the Chief Engineer at the National Nuclear Laboratory\u000a      (NNL; 800+ engineers), commissioned an ethics template to be incorporated\u000a      in all NNL project plans. As he commented: \"Through collaboration with\u000a        IDEA we have produced a practical tool to assure our activities against\u000a        the Royal Academy of Engineering's statement of ethical principles. This\u000a        will allow the NNL to make visible its commitment to ethical practice\u000a        alongside more established mechanisms to illustrate safety and quality\u000a        excellence.\" D)\u000a    II. In the financial area and beyond, the Institute of Chartered\u000a      Accountants for England and Wales (ICAEW) funded (&#163;46,146) a project on Promoting\u000a        Integrity in Organisations (2012). The importance here of\u000a      organisational culture and leadership reflects the neo-Aristotelian\u000a      approach (adopted by Megone) to the significance of wider\u000a      communities and exemplars for the habituation of ethical values, and the\u000a      relation of such embedding of values to promoting genuine integrity.\u000a    The significance and reach of this project is confirmed by the noteworthy\u000a      attendees at its launch events in London and Leeds (World Bank, FSA, Oxfam\u000a      etc.) and by continuing dissemination world wide (ICAEW events in Cyprus,\u000a      Singapore, Vietnam etc., and discussions in The Accountant, Chartered\u000a        Banker, Financial World). Impact on specific individuals was in part\u000a      achieved by the engagement of individual ICAEW members in the research\u000a      process (1500 in the qualitative research, more than 3x the usual\u000a      participation rate, and 96 in the quantitative research). (E)\u000a    The significant impact on individuals also extends to the Leveson\u000a        Inquiry on the Culture, Practice and Ethics of the Press. Our report\u000a      was submitted as part of written evidence on the role of organisational\u000a      culture and leadership in the development of good ethical judgement in the\u000a      media. Its impact can be seen in the use made of it in both Part I and\u000a      Part IV of Lord Leveson's final report.(F)\u000a    The Commonwealth Secretariat also engaged with our Integrity work as\u000a      shown by the Head of Thematic Programmes commissioning seminars at the\u000a      2011 Commonwealth Caribbean Cabinet Secretaries and Heads of Public\u000a      Services Annual Consultative Meeting on the Theme Leadership for\u000a        Development. The seminars, attended by delegates representing 14\u000a      different countries, were \"very well received\". (G)\u000a    We have also engaged with the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA,\u000a      worldwide membership 23,000, 59% UK, 41% overseas) and the Chartered\u000a      Institute of Insurance (CII), using the quasi-experiential approach to\u000a      habituation to improve their CPD work in ethics. The IFoA's professional\u000a      ethics training has been redesigned (initial contract c. &#163;80,000) through\u000a      collaboration with practising actuaries to create online ethics\u000a      case-studies that will foster affective engagement in the exercise of\u000a      ethical judgement. (From Feb 2012 to May 2013, 1011 members enrolled.) The\u000a      initial impact involves (required) engagement with ethics training in a\u000a      significantly revitalised form. For CII we have worked on similar methods\u000a      to promote `habituation' and have delivered workshops on developing good\u000a      ethical judgement, (2011 to 2013, 380 members enrolled) (H)\u000a    Through charitable funding we have made our work accessible to small\u000a      businesses and sole practitioners by developing a Professional Ethics\u000a      Network (membership 350+). This allows 40 practitioners to engage with our\u000a      experiential mode of ethics training every quarter (20+ events since 2008,\u000a      including several co-badged events with UK Inter-Professional Group).\u000a      Again we foster good judgement in part through quasi-experiential case\u000a      studies created with practitioners. (I)\u000a    Our work on promoting good judgement and integrity in individuals has\u000a      also incorporated an audit activity (for both the Higher Education Funding\u000a      Council for England and the Higher Education Academy). This interrogated\u000a      the extent to which effective habituation had given employees an affective\u000a      appreciation of the organisation's professional values. As the Head of\u000a      Internal Audit at HEFCE commented: \"Commissioning the Leeds IDEA team\u000a        to assess [our ethical] culture has proved invaluable. ... In\u000a        particular, it made the significant connection between our role, both\u000a        strategically and operationally, and theoretical ethical principles. ...\u000a        The final report, which leaves the Council with much to think about, has\u000a        been well received by the Council overall.\" (J)\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    More than a decade's research at the University of Leeds has focused on a\u000a      cohesive set of issues bearing directly and indirectly on ethics in the\u000a      workplace: reasons for action, moral psychology, good judgement, character\u000a      and integrity. The impact of this work covers: consultancy on\u000a      organisational ethics; development and delivery of CPD for engineers; use\u000a      of web-based and online materials to engage professionals in ethical\u000a      reasoning; applied research and engagement with practitioners on integrity\u000a      at work; a submission to the Leveson enquiry; and an ethics template for\u000a      the National Nuclear Laboratory.

However the\u000a      materials available to develop professional ethical judgement are often\u000a      limited. Professional ethics textbooks typically present practitioners\u000a      with a selection of `ethical theories' (utilitarianism, deontology ...) as\u000a      though judgement depends on picking a (correct) theory and applying it to\u000a      cases. Equally, professions have presented members either with a code of\u000a      rules, or a set of abstract principles. This leaves practitioners with the\u000a      challenge of arriving at good judgement in light of rules which are not\u000a      self-interpreting and may conflict or leave gaps.\u000a    Our research, carried out at Leeds since 1997, points out the limitations\u000a      of these approaches and underpins a different framework for practical\u000a      professional ethics by examining the role of good judgement and character\u000a      in ethical practice. Heuer (Senior Lecturer, Philosophy, since\u000a      2003) and Lawlor (Research Fellow, Inter-Disciplinary Ethics Applied\u000a      Centre (IDEA), since 2005) (1, 2) explore complications in the\u000a      relation between ethical theories such as deontology and consequentialism\u000a      and reasons for action and judgement. Rather than taking an abstract\u000a      theory, or a code of rules, as sufficient to resolving a practical\u000a      problem, professionals should consider the reasons that apply within the\u000a      case in question and reflect on the sources and significance of those\u000a      reasons.\u000a    The need for good judgement is further underpinned by V&#228;yrynen\u000a      (Senior Lecturer, Philosophy, since 2007) (3), Heuer and Lang\u000a      (Lecturer, Philosophy, since 2005) who all argue (against \"reasons\u000a      fundamentalism\") that reasons themselves need explanation. Explaining\u000a      reasons requires considering various normative factors such as values and\u000a      rights and using judgement to determine what reasons these factors ground\u000a      in the circumstances. This account of reasons for action as signposts to\u000a      what matters coheres well with the suggested importance of good judgement\u000a      in professional practice.\u000a    This foundational research is integrated with more concrete research on\u000a      practical decision-making in Megone's (Senior Lecturer then\u000a      Professor, Philosophy, since 1997) work on neo-Aristotelian moral\u000a      psychology (4, 5). This emphasises the role of `habituation' (the\u000a      acquisition of behavioural traits through guidance, practice and\u000a      repetition) in the development of character and the capacity for good\u000a      judgement. Of particular relevance here is research on the significance of\u000a      experience and quasi-experience in habituation -- their significance is\u000a      reinforced by work by Dow (Research Fellow, IDEA, since 2006) and Megone\u000a        (5, 6) on the role of emotions and affect in the appreciation of\u000a      values and reasons for action. This research grounds the role that\u000a      `affective engagement' plays in our applied analysis of what it takes for\u000a      an organisation to promote integrity (Promoting Integrity in\u000a        Organisations -see section 4.). Organisational values need to be\u000a      apprehended affectively by their members, through `habituation',\u000a      if they are reliably to inform practical decision making.\u000a    This experiential approach and the theoretical research underpinning it\u000a      suggest a particular role for case-studies, designed to achieve\u000a      appropriate emotional engagement, and for organisational culture, in order\u000a      to enhance skills in good judgement. In this way our research has directly\u000a      informed the design of ethics manuals and ethics training in the\u000a      professions, as featured in our portfolio of impactful activities below.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6403","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research projects led by Gooday and Radick in\u000a      collaboration with research students and postdoctoral fellows have allowed\u000a      UK museums and science institutions to develop a deeper understanding of\u000a      IP and its critical bearing on learning resources and on building\u000a      institutional legacies. The research has had a sustainable impact across\u000a      two major areas of collaboration: first through Gooday's\u000a      leadership on projects with the Thackray Medical Museum in Leeds and the\u000a      Museum of the History of Science at the University of Oxford, which have\u000a      helped motivate shifts in historical understanding and generated novel\u000a      engagement with schools; and second, through Radick's research and\u000a      regular consultation with the NIAB at joint supervisions of their Leeds\u000a      CDA students, which have helped re-position the NIAB archive as a\u000a      significant resource.\u000a    Museums and Archives\u000a    The above perspectives on patenting were brought to bear on ca. 1900\u000a      electrical medical technologies and the question of how to display these\u000a      so as to engage 21st Century audiences. The Thackray Medical Museum\u000a      (Leeds) has welcomed input on the multiple meanings of patents for its\u000a      displays. A one-year AHRC Knowledge Transfer Fellowship for a follow-up\u000a      project on re- interpreting the history of medical patents generated\u000a      outcomes that included revised interpretation of patented artefacts in\u000a      Thackray museum collections and a range of online materials (A);\u000a      articles for general medical audiences in the BMJ (B) and\u000a      general science audiences in the New Scientist (C); and\u000a      training workshops for six Thackray staff on 20th and 31st\u000a      January 2012 (corroboration in E). The Thackray's Assistant\u000a      Curator noted how \"the staff training was an opportunity to challenge\u000a        preconceptions around medical patents, the outcome of which was a more\u000a        diverse range of interpretation methods and enabled museum staff to look\u000a        at a collection differently, the outcome of which is inevitably a more\u000a        diverse range of interpretation methods.\" (D) In a\u000a      post-project interview, the Joint CEO at the Thackray reported that the\u000a      project \"was the first time the museum had worked in this way with\u000a        academic partners, but that this had proved so successful that she had\u000a        included the model in funding applications made since.\" (E)\u000a    Gooday's research on communications technologies have also emerged\u000a      as especially instructive for clarifying ca. 1900 IP relationships,\u000a      narrowly and broadly construed, providing the framework, for example, for\u000a      the interview with Elizabeth Bruton (a PhD student on Gooday's\u000a      AHRC-funded CDA project with BT Archives) on Marconi and patents in the\u000a      BBC television series, The Story of Electricity (2011) and The\u000a        Genius of Invention (2013) (F). Bruton is now a Leeds\u000a      postdoctoral researcher on an AHRC-funded Follow-on collaboration with the\u000a      Museum of the History of Science at the University of Oxford on\u000a      `Innovation in Combat', exploring IP issues in First World War\u000a      telecommunications. In collaboration with Leeds teachers, she has\u000a      developed a schools pack from Gooday's research on the patented\u000a      Fullerphone of 1916 that offers pupils a fresh approach to interpreting\u000a      WWI by focusing on inventions, especially in telecommunications, rather\u000a      than on weapons. The lead collaborative partner at Oxford anticipates that\u000a      this project will provide the Museum with \"an opportunity for novel\u000a        schools engagement, and the creation and delivery of new resources\".\u000a      A project workshop on 28 June 2013 engaged 40+ museums and archives staff\u000a      from across the UK with these results and collected evidence of impact\u000a      achieved. (G).\u000a    National Institute of Agricultural Botany\u000a    A seminar for NIAB staff in 2009 by Radick and AHRC project\u000a      student Charnley led to further collaborations, with the aim of using Radick's\u000a      IP-and-genetics research as a framework for putting NIAB's history on a\u000a      firmer scholarly footing. The research was also effective in redefining\u000a      that history, within NIAB and more widely, as a vital resource for\u000a      thinking through pressing questions about private\/public relations in the\u000a      sciences today. In her letter of support for the most recent AHRC CDA\u000a      application with NIAB, its CEO noted (10 November 2011) that the\u000a      partnership with Leeds had identified key issues that enhanced the\u000a      understanding of NIAB's historical foundation. The IP-narrow\/-broad\u000a      distinction has been central to revealing how NIAB's past is relevant to\u000a      its present, notably in energizing research on the difficulties\u000a      surrounding its foundation as servant of both the British state and\u000a      commercial plant breeders. Stressing that the challenges of funding the\u000a      NIAB's applied, translational work have never gone away, the CEO reported\u000a      that \"exploring that early rationale is helping us to position NIAB\u000a        firmly at the interface between basic plant science and application,\u000a        providing a pathway to impact for research.\" The strategic\u000a      importance of the work of the Leeds researchers in the run-up to NIAB's\u000a      centenary plans, in 2019, was further underscored, especially with regard\u000a      to facilitating understanding of how NIAB has adapted to major changes\u000a      affecting the ecosystem in which it operates. In expanding its work with\u000a      Leeds, it was noted, NIAB will be better able to make use of its history \"to\u000a        strengthen and guide our strategy, developing key messages about our\u000a        ability to adapt and respond, and positioning us to take advantage of\u000a        development opportunities.\" (I)\u000a    Taking forward this collaborative project, NIAB and Radick have\u000a      worked together to secure three CDA awards, funding research on the\u000a      Institute's value as a knowledge-making site over three periods: from its\u000a      founding in 1919 to 1969; from 1969 to the present; and in the present\u000a      day. The project student on the first CDA, Dominic Berry, has not only\u000a      organized NIAB's archive (J) but has presented his research at the\u000a      NIAB Founders Day (10 Feb. 2012) and other on-site events. As a result of\u000a      these activities (informed by Radick's IP-narrow\/-broad\u000a      framework), key aspects of NIAB's past have been made newly accessible and\u000a      relevant to staff there. In praising the transformation of NIAB's archive\u000a      into \"a much-valued resource,\" NIAB's Communications Manager\u000a      expressed particular appreciation for the way that the Leeds team's work\u000a      has revealed how far \"NIAB's original aims and objectives in\u000a        supporting the development of improved crop varieties and seeds to\u000a        safeguard food supplies are as relevant today in terms of addressing\u000a        food security as they were in 1919.\" (K)\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case demonstrates the impact of collaborative research undertaken at\u000a      the University of Leeds with regard to the role of intellectual property\u000a      (IP) in the technosciences.

Yet when researchers,\u000a      or the companies they work for, claim ownership rights over their\u000a      discoveries or inventions, the result is often profound unease. What, in\u000a      the twenty-first century, are the most valuable lessons to learn from\u000a      history about the proper place of ownership claims in the technosciences?\u000a      It was with the aim of answering this question that Graeme Gooday\u000a      (at Leeds since 1994) and Gregory Radick (at Leeds since 2000 and\u000a      working on this project since 2006) established an AHRC-funded project in\u000a      2007 (i) with Professor Christine MacLeod (Bristol) looking at IP\u000a      as shaping, and shaped by, British science and technology in the decades\u000a      around 1900. Each brought to bear distinctive research expertise: Gooday\u000a      in Victorian electrical technoscience and its contexts (1); Radick\u000a      in the history of genetics and its intersections with IP (2); and\u000a      MacLeod in early aeronautics and the British patent system.\u000a    A major outlet for the research of the project team (which included a\u000a      Leeds-based postdoctoral fellow, Dr Stathis Arapostathis, and a\u000a      postgraduate student Berris Charnley) is a recent special issue of the\u000a      journal Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, edited by\u000a      MacLeod and Radick (3). The nine papers make use of a new and\u000a      general conceptual framework developed by Radick for the analysis\u000a      of IP claims in the technosciences. The core proposal is to study\u000a      interactions between IP claims narrowly construed &#8212; the familiar legal\u000a      instruments of patents, trademarks and so on (`IP-narrow') &#8212; and other,\u000a      broader sorts of ownership claims (`IP-broad'), notably claims to have\u000a      discovered something first (`priority claims') and, on behalf of a\u000a      discipline, claims that its theoretical principles explain the success of\u000a      useful techniques and technologies (`productivity claims'). This\u000a      recognition of intersecting narrow and broad concepts of IP is making\u000a      possible a more comprehensive mapping of the complex ways in which\u000a      ownership claims have conditioned innovation in the sciences.\u000a    Beyond the special issue, project outputs include journal articles by Gooday\u000a        (4 &amp; 5), the PhD thesis by the Leeds-based AHRC project student\u000a      Berris Charnley, and an MIT Press monograph co-authored by Gooday\u000a      with Arapostathis (based at Leeds during the research and drafting), which\u000a      offers a detailed reconstruction of a number of extraordinary patent\u000a      controversies in late Victorian electrical technoscience (6). In\u000a      this work, Arapostathis and Gooday urge that the presumption in\u000a      patent law of a \"true and first\" inventor unhelpfully perpetuates the myth\u000a      that invention is an individual, rather than collective, activity.\u000a    The project has also generated `spin off' funded research initiatives,\u000a      notably collaborative PhD and postdoctoral projects on patents and\u000a      innovation in telecommunications and medicine and on the history of the\u000a      National Institute of Agricultural Botany, which was shown by Radick's\u000a      research to have been instrumental in securing the reputation of genetics\u000a      among British plant breeders (ii-v). In addition, Radick\u000a      established the IPBio regional and international research network on\u000a      intellectual property and the technosciences, serving to bring together\u000a      academics, lawyers and policymakers (vi).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7433","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Hobbs' research on Plato's ethics has underpinned her work engaging the\u000a      public with philosophy. In her media appearances and public talks she has\u000a      used ancient Greek philosophy to present new arguments and expression for\u000a      public discourse about contemporary social and political issues. She has\u000a      provided expert advice to government departments and charities on the\u000a      value of philosophy in education. The beneficiaries of her activities\u000a      include UK and international broadcasters and their audiences, primary and\u000a      secondary schools, policymakers, and educational charities.\u000a    Media\u000a      By speaking about her research on a range of television and radio\u000a      programmes, including historical programmes, features, current affairs and\u000a      news shows, Hobbs has offered new knowledge about the ancient world,\u000a      skills in reasoning, and a different perspective on social and political\u000a      issues. For instance, Hobbs participated in a panel discussion on the\u000a      London riots, a live broadcast from Birmingham city hall of the BBC Radio\u000a      4 programme Today (live audience of 800; 5.9.2011). In response to\u000a      government comments that the rioters were `a shameless, feral underclass',\u000a      Hobbs argued that `few human beings are without a sense of honour and\u000a      shame and a desire for status and desire to count for something', which\u000a      draws directly on her research about Plato's concept of the thumos\u000a      and `the need to believe that one counts for something'. Her appearance a\u000a      few days later on The Moral Maze `What are prisons for?' elicited\u000a      a number of listener responses. One email from a former criminal defence\u000a      solicitor said, `I feel very strongly about the way people talk about\u000a      youths who commit criminal offences and I found what you said both\u000a      sensitive and sensible and I really appreciated hearing your viewpoint. I\u000a      thought that you showed a true understanding of the way those who I used\u000a      to represent functioned.' [08.09.2011]\u000a    Her media appearances since 2008 include the Today programme on\u000a      morality and tax avoidance (28.7.2012; avg 6.6 million listeners), Nightwaves\u000a      (17.5.2012 on athletic performance and human potential; 8.11.2010 on\u000a      Heroes; 300,000 on the day listeners), Start the Week on heroism\u000a      and bravery (23.5.2011, avg 1.5 million listeners), Woman's Hour\u000a      (29.12.2011 on New Year's Resolutions, self-fulfilment and human\u000a      flourishing; avg 4 million listeners) and more than 20 appearances on In\u000a        Our Time (sample topics: Aristotle's Politics and Poetics;\u000a      Neoplatonism and Heraclitus; avg 2.2 million on the day listeners). She\u000a      has written articles for national newspapers on ethics: The Guardian's\u000a      `Citizen's Ethics in a Time of Crisis' (`Ethics of Money'; 11.7K reads and\u000a      5.1K embedded views on Scribd) and has been interviewed for the Financial\u000a        Times and the New York Times.\u000a    Many of her media appearances have been on programmes that cover news and\u000a      current affairs showing that producers recognise the value that a\u000a      philosophical perspective can bring to discussion about contemporary\u000a      issues. Audience responses demonstrate that her input resonates with the\u000a      listening public. As an example of the many emails she receives from\u000a      listeners: `Firstly I should say I would have previously been a little\u000a      dismissive of philosophy or the study of philosophy as a course. However,\u000a      listening to your interview on Radio 4 was really interesting and you drew\u000a      me in with what you had to say and how the study of philosophy can enrich\u000a      your life....As a 36 year old sales manager, I am not likely to go back to\u000a      university but I would be interested in learning more.' [17.10.2009]\u000a    Media producers who have invited Hobbs on to their shows have expressed\u000a      their appreciation for the value her perspective adds: `Thank you so much\u000a      for coming on STW [Start the Week] this morning - I thought you\u000a      presented your definition of heroes extremely well, and I'm very grateful\u000a      for the work you did in thinking about the questions for the other guests.\u000a      Think of us in the future if you have any interesting projects.'\u000a      [23.05.2011] Melvyn Bragg, presenter of In Our Time, has said that\u000a      Hobbs has been on the programme `more than any other contributor since it\u000a      began 14 years ago! Her ability to explain philosophy is remarkable. She\u000a      can explain it to the lay person both succinctly and comprehensively while\u000a      never letting go of the complexity and weight of the issue involved.'\u000a      [20.04.2012] Fellow public philosophers have also expressed admiration and\u000a      appreciation for Hobbs' work: `I've been following your work for a long\u000a      time now, with huge appreciation. You have utterly mastered your brief,\u000a      delivering first rate philosophy and true public engagement.' [10.01.2011]\u000a    Public Events\u000a      She has contributed to public discourse and enriched cultural life by\u000a      speaking about her research at public events such as the Hay-on-Wye\u000a      Literary Festival (2012), Bristol Festival of Ideas (2011), Cheltenham\u000a      Literary Festival (2011) and the BBC Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival\u000a      (2010). Broadcast simultaneously on Radio 3, her talk on `Heroes' was the\u000a      `Radio Choice' in The Daily Express (08.11.2010) and the `Pick of\u000a      the Day' in The Daily Telegraph (06.11.2010). As Chair of the\u000a      Trustees of the Institute of Art and Ideas (2010-11) she was responsible\u000a      for overseeing the organisation of the Trust's festival How the Light\u000a        Gets In, which aims `to get philosophy out of the academy and into\u000a      people's lives.' She has also spoken at the festival (2010-12) about her\u000a      research on Plato, love, metaphor and the myth of Atlantis. The Event\u000a      Producer said of her contribution that `the truth talk was one of the\u000a      highlights of Saturday.' [01.06.2010] In 2010, she was appointed `Town\u000a      Philosopher' for Malmesbury, Wiltshire where she also speaks at their\u000a      annual philosophy festival.\u000a    Educational and Charitable Activities\u000a      Hobbs has provided expert advice to government departments and charitable\u000a      organisations about the benefits of teaching philosophy in schools. She\u000a      was invited to become an Honorary Patron of the educational charity, The\u000a      Philosophy Foundation, and supports the voluntary organisation SAPERE who\u000a      promote philosophy in schools and communities. As Honorary Patron of The\u000a      Philosophy Foundation, Hobbs was invited to attend a meeting with the\u000a      senior policy adviser at the Department for Education and staff from the\u000a      National Curriculum Review and the Curriculum Policy divisions to discuss\u000a      including philosophy in the new national curriculum (07.12.2011). She\u000a      participated in the Philosopher's Football Match in May 2010 to raise\u000a      awareness of the 4Rs campaign (reading, writing, arithmetic and\u000a      reasoning). She has spoken at conferences on philosophy in education: she\u000a      was the keynote at the `Philosophy and Education' conference at Rugby\u000a      School, May 2012; The Sunday Times `Festival of Education', June\u000a      2011, where she spoke to audiences including politicians and educators;\u000a      and she was an invited speaker at the LSE's Roundtable on `Philosophy for\u000a      Children' (23.06.2011) where she spoke about how a school philosophy\u000a      programme can benefit from ancient Greek philosophy to an audience which\u000a      included school heads, charities, academics and policy advisors. The\u000a      organiser has said that `The feedback I have had from everyone I have\u000a      spoken to has been incredibly good - an in particular about your\u000a      presentation, which was brilliant! Thank you so much for all your support\u000a      and help here.' [30.06.2011] Hobbs has also given talks to A-level\u000a      students (nearly 20 schools since 2008). Feedback from her school visits\u000a      include: `Thank you so much for another stimulating talk. The students\u000a      were both stretched and fascinated, and I was reminded that Aristotle's\u000a      position is far more complex than A Level textbooks allow.' [16.05.2011]\u000a    Further evidence of the sapience that philosophy can contribute to public\u000a      discourse on major issues is highlighted by a speech in the House of Lords\u000a      by Bragg about cuts to arts funding (03.02.2011), `By chance, I did a\u000a      radio programme on Aristotle last week...Professor Angie Hobbs of Warwick\u000a      University pointed out that Aristotle thought of art as much more central\u000a      to human existence than mere pleasure. He believed that the correct\u000a      appreciation of art was crucial for the formation of a person's character\u000a      and would improve their behaviour in society as a whole.'\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    `What sort of person should I be?' is central to Plato's ethical\u000a      framework, and carries significant relevance for reflection on modern\u000a      society.

She has\u000a      also examined the use of language and metaphor in his philosophy,\u000a      especially in relation to the female body.\u000a    Her monograph Plato and the Hero (2000; paperback 2006) explored\u000a      the nature of true heroism through Plato's dialogues. By focussing on\u000a      courage as the central theme, Hobbs elevated courage to a new level of\u000a      prominence among the Platonic virtues. She examines Plato's critiques of\u000a      the notions and embodiments of manliness prevalent in his own culture,\u000a      particularly those of Homer, and his attempts to re-define them according\u000a      to his own ethical, psychological and metaphysical principles. Hobbs\u000a      locates the discussion of courage and manliness within the broader\u000a      framework of Plato's general approach to ethics - an approach which\u000a      focuses on the concepts of eudaimonia (flourishing) and virtue.\u000a      She argues that Plato's approach to ethics leads to close structural links\u000a      between ethical and aesthetic judgments - both are concerned with proper\u000a      mathematical relations between the parts and the whole. This attempted\u000a      unification creates tensions between human and divine ideals. To address\u000a      these themes Hobbs studied 10 of Plato's dialogues: The Republic,\u000a      Laches, Protagoras, Gorgias, Apology, Hippas\u000a        Minor, Hippas Major, The Symposium, Politicus\u000a      and Laws.\u000a    Dr Hobbs highlighted the important place of the thumos (spirit)\u000a      in The Republic as a major component of Plato's psychology. The thumos\u000a      is the part of the soul that centres on `the need to believe that one\u000a      counts for something'. At the heart of this need is the `tendency to form\u000a      an ideal image of oneself in accordance with one's conception of the fine\u000a      and noble' (p.30). It manifests itself both in the capacity for anger and\u000a      shame, and in the need for role models that embody one's aspirant\u000a      self-image. Closely associated to the thumos is Plato's concept of\u000a      andreia (courage) introduced in Book IV of The Republic.\u000a      Hobbs shows how the tripartite psychology of The Republic, which\u000a      now includes the thumos, allows Plato to account for the virtue of\u000a      courage, something he failed to do in previous dialogues. The thumos,\u000a      understood in Plato's earlier dialogues as `manliness', can be influenced\u000a      by proper education in which role models play an important role.\u000a    Another central theme of her book is whether Plato's concept of courage\u000a      should be equated with the predominantly male attributes of warfare and\u000a      physical prowess. This has implications for whether women can have courage\u000a      and thereby true human flourishing. Hobbs argues that Plato re-shapes the\u000a      notion of courage to make it suitable for philosophical life and therefore\u000a      gender neutral, but that Plato continued to use `manly' language as a way\u000a      of attracting men to the philosophical life. This use of gendered language\u000a      and imagery and how it reflects Plato's views about women is also explored\u000a      elsewhere in Hobbs' research. Hobbs argues that Plato uses both male and\u000a      female imagery to represent philosophy. Gender is an inevitable part of\u000a      everyday life and thus an acceptable reference point for rhetorical and\u000a      pedagogical purposes. Ultimately, Plato believes that ascension to the\u000a      realm of non-gendered forms is the ultimate human goal, rendering gender\u000a      irrelevant.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7434","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research on the aesthetics of photography has fired public debate\u000d\u000a      about the status of photography as an art.

These impacts have been achieved through an exhibition of an\u000d\u000a      under- exposed contemporary British photographer, workshops with gallery\u000d\u000a      curators and conservators, public events, and through non-academic\u000d\u000a      publications such as books, exhibition catalogues and podcasts.\u000d\u000a    High profile events have brought the researchers and their academic\u000d\u000a      networks into contact with practising photographic artists and curators.\u000d\u000a      These include: a two day panel with art theorists, curators and critics at\u000d\u000a      the Association of Art Historians Conference at Tate Britain\u000d\u000a      (3-4.04.2008), a two day event with photographic artists at the Institute\u000d\u000a      for Philosophy, London (21-22.11.2008) and a public conference, `Agency\u000d\u000a      and Automatism', at the Tate Modern (10-12.06.2010) with a keynote by Jeff\u000d\u000a      Wall, the most influential contemporary photographic artist. This\u000d\u000a      conference, ticketed by Tate (&#163;25\/&#163;20 concessions), sold out the 250-seat\u000d\u000a      Starr auditorium (for a total income of &#163;6250) and attracted a substantial\u000d\u000a      waiting list.

Photography after Conceptual Art, published\u000d\u000a      as a book in 2010, has sold over 2000 copies (as of August 2013) making it\u000d\u000a      the best-selling title ever in Art History's book list.\u000d\u000a    Costello was invited to curate `Twenty-Nine Pictures,' the first\u000d\u000a      mid-career retrospective of Hannah Starkey, an important but under-exposed\u000d\u000a      contemporary British photographer at the Mead Gallery, Warwick Arts Centre\u000d\u000a      (Jan-Mar 2011). This was accompanied by 85pp hardback colour catalogue,\u000d\u000a      with an essay by Iversen and an interview by Costello. The show was\u000d\u000a      reviewed in traditional media and online magazines\/blogs including the\u000d\u000a      Claudia Winkleman Show (BBC Radio 2, 04\/02\/11; approx. audience 2.5\u000d\u000a      million, RAJAR figures), The Times, The Independent, The\u000d\u000a        Telegraph, eight specialist photography magazines\/websites as well\u000d\u000a      as 30+ general websites and blogs. The Telegraph online culture\u000d\u000a      pages reprinted an extract from Costello's interview with the artist. The\u000d\u000a      show was listed as an `Art must-see' for January 2011 by the leading\u000d\u000a      culture website Culture24.\u000d\u000a    The exhibition recorded a footfall of 6812 visitors over 49 days, a daily\u000d\u000a      average of 139. In 2010-11 the Mead's average was 108, in 2009-2010 it was\u000d\u000a      94; as such it is the Mead's most successful show of the last 3 years. 100\u000d\u000a      copies of the catalogue were sold during the show at a special price of\u000d\u000a      &#163;10, 107 were sent to various critics, curators and institutions around\u000d\u000a      the world (at no cost), and a further 183 sold by the gallery's\u000d\u000a      distributor (at &#163;16 each; total &#163;2928). The evening discussion (1 Mar\u000d\u000a      2011) with Starkey was over-subscribed (138 turned up for a 100 seat event\u000d\u000a      and many stood) and the podcast has been downloaded 544 times to July\u000d\u000a      2013. This level of exposure helps justify the gallery's existence as the\u000d\u000a      only space-intensive, non-income generating resource within the Arts\u000d\u000a      Centre, and thereby ensure that it remains free to the public for the\u000d\u000a      foreseeable future. As her first curated retrospective, the show also\u000d\u000a      raised the profile of an important UK-based photographer, thereby\u000d\u000a      benefiting both the artist and her gallery, Maureen Paley (London),\u000d\u000a      generating interest in a further one-person show at Ormeau Baths Gallery\u000d\u000a      in Belfast (3.6 - 9.7.2011).\u000d\u000a    As part of Prof Lopes' Leverhulme Professorship, Costello and Lopes\u000d\u000a      convened a seminar for Tate curatorial staff, V&amp;A conservators and\u000d\u000a      invited specialists at Tate Modern (May 2012) to coincide with the\u000d\u000a      publication of their special journal issue `The Media of Photography'.\u000d\u000a      About the philosophical conceptions of photography discussed, Tate's\u000d\u000a      Director of Collection Care Research said:\u000d\u000a    `It is surprisingly rare that the divide between the museum and academy\u000d\u000a      is breached and in speaking to the museum curators and conservators\u000d\u000a      afterwards they very much appreciated the opportunity to engage in this\u000d\u000a      discourse. The discussion of the photographer Dan Holdsworth was picked up\u000d\u000a      the following week at a Photography Acquisition Meeting. This linked the\u000d\u000a      questions raised in the seminar about the defining characteristics of a\u000d\u000a      photograph to curatorial decisions and discussions. In this very direct\u000d\u000a      way, the seminar has had an impact on the discourse within the museum in\u000d\u000a      relation to contemporary photographic practice.'\u000d\u000a    Costello has also contributed to catalogues for exhibitions in the UK\u000d\u000a      (White Cube, London) and Russia (The Hermitage, St. Petersburg).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Since the 1960s, mainstream photographic art practice has undergone a\u000d\u000a      significant shift, from a primarily factual, documentary medium to a\u000d\u000a      vehicle of aesthetically rich, often narrative, pictorial art.\u000d\u000a      Photography's internalization of digital technology has hastened this\u000d\u000a      shift. In light of this, the research on `Aesthetics after Photography'\u000d\u000a      has re-evaluated the aesthetic capabilities of photography by examining\u000d\u000a      its use by artists since the 1960s. This re-assessment has changed the way\u000d\u000a      that curators and conservators (Tate, V&amp;A) conceptualise the nature of\u000d\u000a      photography. It has been used to curate a high-profile exhibition of a\u000d\u000a      leading British photographer, benefitting the galleries (Mead; Maureen\u000d\u000a      Paley) and the artist.

By the late 1970s photography had superseded painting as\u000d\u000a      contemporary art's privileged object of critical and theoretical enquiry.\u000d\u000a      Since the mid-1980s there has also been growing interest in photography as\u000d\u000a      a distinct domain of philosophical aesthetics. Three things are striking\u000d\u000a      about these debates, when taken together: i. they take place largely in\u000d\u000a      ignorance of one another; ii. they arrive at remarkably similar views\u000d\u000a      about what distinguishes photography from other forms of picture-making;\u000d\u000a      iii. despite this, they draw conflicting implications for photography's\u000d\u000a      status as an art. For many art critics and historians, the photographic\u000d\u000a      apparatus's capacity to limit artistic agency underwrites its promise as a\u000d\u000a      new artistic resource; for many philosophers, the `mind-independence' of\u000d\u000a      photographic image formation puts its artistic standing in question.\u000d\u000a    Given such opposed intuitions, we pursued an interdisciplinary approach\u000d\u000a      to advance debates in ways that could not be achieved in isolation,\u000d\u000a      thereby benefiting from expertise and methodologies normally kept apart.\u000d\u000a      For example, by drawing on art historical expertise and photographic art\u000d\u000a      we were able to show that standard philosophical theories of photography\u000d\u000a      are grounded on a narrow diet of examples and an implausibly thin\u000d\u000a      conception of the medium. Conversely, by drawing on characteristic forms\u000d\u000a      of philosophical argument, we were able to show that common assumptions\u000d\u000a      about the `ontological' differences between analogue and digital\u000d\u000a      photography in art history and criticism do not withstand philosophical\u000d\u000a      analysis. Throughout, our aim was to use each discipline to illuminate\u000d\u000a      blind-spots in the other.\u000d\u000a    Our focus was the relation between aesthetic theory and photographic art\u000d\u000a      over the last 50 years. Despite significant changes in the latter, the\u000d\u000a      former continues to reflect the hold of the same old underlying picture: a\u000d\u000a      causal, `mind-independent' process, mediated by a mechanical or automatic\u000d\u000a      apparatus, generating objective, `naturally counterfactually dependent'\u000d\u000a      images at odds with fully fledged artistic agency. The photographer may\u000d\u000a      tamper with the image, thereby weakening mind-independence and enhancing\u000d\u000a      its capacity to reflect artistic intentionality. But absent such\u000d\u000a      `extra-photographic' interventions in image production, photographs are\u000d\u000a      inherently compromised as vehicles for aesthetically relevant intention.\u000d\u000a      This picture permeates both philosophy and art history:\u000d\u000a      we concluded that there is good reason to question it. We do not take the\u000d\u000a      mechanical mediation of sound to undermine the art of playing piano, nor\u000d\u000a      the causal determinants of trajectory and velocity to undermine the art of\u000d\u000a      playing a winning pass in tennis. Pianist and tennis player alike act\u000d\u000a      through the causal process: why assume photography is any different? That\u000d\u000a      the transfer of paint from brush to canvas is wholly governed by causal\u000d\u000a      laws has never been taken to undermine painting's status as art.\u000d\u000a      Publications arising from the project have also shown orthodox accounts in\u000d\u000a      art history and philosophy remain committed to an unexamined conception of\u000d\u000a      what counts as a photograph that rule out imaging processes necessary to a\u000d\u000a      photograph's existence as `extra-photographic.'\u000d\u000a    The research was conducted between 2007 and 2011.

It is the backbone of not only philosophy courses but a range of\u000d\u000a      courses from political thought and law, to German studies and languages,\u000d\u000a      to medicine. In doing so, it has benefitted course leaders by providing a\u000d\u000a      structured approach for teaching Nietzsche and a single, convenient source\u000d\u000a      of key readings. It has brought economic benefits to the publishing\u000d\u000a      industry, selling ten times more copies worldwide than comparable works.\u000d\u000a    Students who use The Nietzsche Reader have benefitted from a\u000d\u000a      resource which makes Nietzsche's most important writings easily\u000d\u000a      accessible. The book's general introduction situates Nietzsche's thinking\u000d\u000a      in its cultural and intellectual contexts enabling students to understand\u000d\u000a      the wider influences on Nietzsche's philosophy. The chronological\u000d\u000a      presentation of Nietzsche's works enables students to see the intellectual\u000d\u000a      and stylistic development of Nietzsche's writing over time. The selections\u000d\u000a      of key readings focus students in on the main points of Nietzsche's\u000d\u000a      thought and on selections from the corpus that guide and inform current\u000d\u000a      research into Nietzsche, such as the renewed interest in the neglected\u000d\u000a      middle period texts from 1878-82 and the distinctive character of\u000d\u000a      Nietzsche's ethical naturalism. It does not privilege either an\u000d\u000a      `analytical' or a `continental' reading of Nietzsche but rather aims to\u000d\u000a      highlight what is unique, distinctive, and challenging about Nietzsche as\u000d\u000a      a philosopher.\u000d\u000a    The Nietzsche Reader is intended to replace A Nietzsche Reader\u000d\u000a      a Penguin Classic edited by Hollingdale and first published in 1977. The\u000d\u000a      Penguin Reader is a slim volume intended for the general reader, and not\u000d\u000a      informed by the latest scholarship or scholarly appreciation of Nietzsche.\u000d\u000a      The Nietzsche Reader is the set text for teaching Nietzsche at\u000d\u000a      university level. It is several times the length of the Penguin Reader,\u000d\u000a      and it adopts a chronological rather than a thematic approach. It includes\u000d\u000a      a general introduction, six mini-introductions to the selections, a\u000d\u000a      chronology of Nietzsche's life and work, and an extensive bibliography of\u000d\u000a      primary and secondary material. Of significance is that The Reader\u000d\u000a      includes early pieces of Nietzsche's writings that had never before been\u000d\u000a      collected into book format as well as new translations from Nachlass.\u000d\u000a      Key selections from Nachlass were first dealt with by\u000d\u000a      Ansell-Pearson in two publications in 2005 and 2006 and this research was\u000d\u000a      used to inform the introductory material in The Nietzsche Reader.\u000d\u000a      The Reader also takes into account recent developments in\u000d\u000a      Nietzschean scholarship, so providing an updated scholarly context.\u000d\u000a    The reach of the impact is demonstrated in the first instance by the\u000d\u000a      number of sales figures. By the end of the assessment period, The\u000d\u000a        Reader had sold more than 12,000 copies worldwide, the majority to\u000d\u000a      universities and colleges, 10 times comparable books - Ansell-Pearson's Reader's\u000a        Guide to Nietzsche's BGE has sold 1200 copies since 2011; Peter\u000d\u000a      Poellner's book on Nietzsche has sold 1200 copies since 2000; Brian Lieter\u000d\u000a      reports that his Nietzsche and Morality sold 1200 between 2007 and\u000d\u000a      2012. The sales figures are supported by popular reviews, receiving 4 out\u000d\u000a      of 5 stars on Amazon.com, librarything.com and goodreads.com (300\u000d\u000a      ratings).\u000d\u000a    Further evidence of its uptake in university courses is demonstrated by\u000d\u000a      course syllabi, including undergraduate and postgraduate courses in\u000d\u000a      philosophy, but also in other subjects, including political thought,\u000d\u000a      sociology, languages and German studies, being a required textbook on many\u000d\u000a      of these courses. Examples of the courses for which The Reader is\u000d\u000a      required include Modern Political Thought at Carleton University (Canada),\u000d\u000a      the History of Ideas postgraduate level course at the University of Texas,\u000d\u000a      Dallas (USA) and introductory philosophy courses at the University of New\u000d\u000a      South Wales (AUS), and Northwestern University (USA). The reach of the\u000d\u000a      impact also extends to FE colleges and independent schools who have used\u000d\u000a      the book to support the teaching of philosophy to A-level students in\u000d\u000a      preparation for university entrance, including for example, Ibstock Place\u000d\u000a      School (London) and Whitgift School (London).\u000d\u000a    The significance of the impact is demonstrated by the fact that it has\u000d\u000a      become the standard edition for teaching Nietzsche's writings in several\u000d\u000a      disciplines, replacing the previous introductory text published in 1977.\u000d\u000a      It offers teachers and students an up-to-date historiographical context\u000d\u000a      and recent scholarship on Nietzsche. Significance is also demonstrated by\u000d\u000a      repeated use: several colleges and universities, such as Loyola College\u000d\u000a      (USA) and the Medical School at the University of Louisville (USA)\u000d\u000a      continue to use the textbook on a yearly basis. Feedback from requestors\u000d\u000a      indicates that teachers of Nietzsche's philosophy have seen significant\u000d\u000a      value in using the resource. Readers commented that it is a `very good\u000d\u000a      general introduction' for Nietzsche studies and `extremely valuable as a\u000d\u000a      teaching resource'. Several readers complimented the choice of texts: `An\u000d\u000a      excellent survey'; and `This is a very good selection from the writings of\u000d\u000a      Nietzsche which is both careful and timely. It supersedes the earlier\u000d\u000a      selections from Nietzsche such as Kaufmann.' Thus, The Nietzsche\u000d\u000a        Reader has demonstrated that it has made a significant impact on the\u000d\u000a      ability of university-level course leaders around the world to deliver\u000d\u000a      Nietzsche in a manner accessible to students, providing them with insight\u000d\u000a      into the writings of a key thinker of the modern age.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study relates to impact on teaching in Higher Education which\u000d\u000a      extends significantly beyond Warwick and philosophy.

He has edited and annotated some of Nietzsche's key\u000d\u000a      texts, including The Genealogy of Morality (1994, rev. edn.,\u000d\u000a      2007); written on Nietzsche's political thought (1994) and on the\u000d\u000a      `philosophical biology' behind his theory of human evolution (1997); and\u000d\u000a      produced a reader's guide to Nietzsche's key text Beyond Good and Evil\u000d\u000a      (2011). His principal contributions to Nietzschean studies include a more\u000d\u000a      nuanced understanding of Nietzsche's role as a political theorist, an\u000d\u000a      attempt to illuminate Nietzsche's understanding of `life', and a critical\u000d\u000a      exposition of his perhaps most neglected text from 1881, Dawn (he\u000d\u000a      wrote the Afterword to the new translation and edition of the text\u000d\u000a      published by Stanford University Press in 2011 and in their prestigious\u000d\u000a      edition of `The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche'. He will publish a\u000d\u000a      commentary on the text in 2014\/15).\u000d\u000a    In his published work on Nietzsche Ansell-Pearson has illuminated\u000d\u000a      neglected and overlooked aspects of Nietzsche's thinking, as well as\u000d\u000a      complex and difficult notions such as the overhuman and the eternal\u000d\u000a      return. He has highlighted Nietzsche's specific philosophical\u000d\u000a      contributions and concerns; for example, the stress Nietzsche places on\u000d\u000a      our ability to `incorporate' truth. Nietzsche does not simply ask `what is\u000d\u000a      truth?' but rather shows that we need to learn how we can assimilate truth\u000d\u000a      practices and acquire truth and knowledge in our everyday habits and modes\u000d\u000a      of living. We can ask: is truth compatible with living where we know that\u000d\u000a      `life' depends on error and illusion?\u000d\u000a    Ansell-Pearson's expertise in Nietzsche's principal texts and his new\u000d\u000a      research into Nietzsche's previously unpublished writings has fed directly\u000d\u000a      into The Nietzsche Reader (2006), a textbook comprising\u000d\u000a      Nietzsche's key writings co-edited with Professor Duncan Large of Swansea\u000d\u000a      University. It does so in several ways. Research into Nietzsche's writings\u000d\u000a      informed the selection of material from Nietzsche, and a detailed\u000d\u000a      knowledge of Nietzsche's philosophical project and philosophical\u000d\u000a      development enabled a selection of texts that best illustrate his views\u000d\u000a      and show how they developed over the course of his life. The research\u000d\u000a      directly informed the general introduction and the introductions that\u000d\u000a      preface the five main sections (totalling about 50 pages). Research into\u000d\u000a      Nietzche's Nachlass made possible the translation and discussion\u000d\u000a      in the introductions of two Nachlass selections previously\u000d\u000a      unavailable in English.\u000d\u000a    The volume is of academic significance because it incorporates early\u000d\u000a      pieces of Nietzsche's writings that had never before been collected into\u000d\u000a      book form, as well as new translations from Nachlass, which\u000d\u000a      include Nietzsche's first outline of the doctrine of eternal return dated\u000d\u000a      1881 and his key notebook on European nihilism from 1887 (only now do we\u000d\u000a      have this available in unexpurgated form). A distinct feature of The\u000d\u000a        Reader is its greater focus on Nietzsche's early writings than\u000d\u000a      previous collections. There are generous selections from Nietzsche's most\u000d\u000a      studied texts, such as The Birth of Tragedy and On the\u000d\u000a        Genealogy of Morality, and also includes selections from lesser\u000d\u000a      known materials and texts, such as Nietzsche's very first attempts at\u000d\u000a      philosophical writing from 1862 (Emersonian-inspired essays on fate and\u000d\u000a      free will) and texts that are only now assuming importance for students\u000d\u000a      and scholars, such as Human, all too Human and Dawn.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7830","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Delivery\u000a    In order to benefit users and lead to impact, the underpinning research\u000a      was disseminated and\u000a      further developed with special focus on its practical applications through\u000a      (a) the training of\u000a      undergraduate philosophers in the tenets of the underpinning research and\u000a      the delivery of\u000a      workshops and lessons to young people; (b) the presentation of the\u000a      methodology at practitioner-conferences;\u000a      (c) freely accessible electronic resources.\u000a    (a)In partnership with Liverpool College and Liverpool Biennial,\u000a      Vassilopoulou trained students\u000a      (through an accredited undergraduate module and a volunteering scheme) in\u000a      classical\u000a      techniques of self understanding and the incorporation of metaphor and\u000a      story telling into\u000a      teaching, to deliver Philosophy and PSHE lessons to a selected group of\u000a      KS3 pupils during a\u000a      three week placement (2012-13) and facilitate free Philosophy and Art\u000a      workshops for children in\u000a      KS1&amp;2 (across the region) and their families as part of the official\u000a      programme of Liverpool\u000a        Biennial 2012.\u000a    (b) The methodology was further disseminated through presentations at\u000a      practitioner conferences at\u000a      which teachers and educationalists were present, such as Teaching\u000a          the Teaching of Philosophy\u000a          with Children (Greenwich, May 2012) and Educating\u000a        Wellbeing (Liverpool, October 2012),\u000a      fostering comparisons and evaluation of different methodologies and\u000a      best-practice sharing.\u000a    (c) Vassilopoulou's collaboration with the EU-funded Open Discovery Space\u000a      (ODS) project led to\u000a      the dissemination of research to the ODS's consortium, including\u000a      beneficiaries such as Intrasoft,\u000a      NGOs, and UNESCO and a network of 4,000 European school communities. We\u000a      designed\u000a      interactive learning objects that exemplify our methodology and\u000a      educational content, which\u000a      became available to all ODS users, thereby also facilitating knowledge\u000a      sharing between school\u000a      communities, educationalists and policy makers at international level.\u000a      This, then, expanded and\u000a      will continue to expand both the significance and reach of the Lyceum's\u000a      impact beyond the\u000a      directly targeted local communities. Moreover, international dissemination\u000a      was also achieved\u000a      through the Lyceum Project website,\u000a      which between April and July 2013 had over 2100 visitors\u000a      (15% of them international).\u000a    Measuring Impact\u000a    (i) Changes in Subjective Wellbeing Indicators:\u000a    In order to measure the impact on improving the subjective wellbeing of\u000a      pupils taking the PSHE\u000a      lessons informed by our methodology, we collaborated with New\u000a        Philanthropy Capital (NPC), a\u000a      consultancy think-tank, which has developed the Wellbeing\u000a        Measure Tool to analyse and evaluate\u000a      young persons' subjective wellbeing. We conducted this survey on 110\u000a      participating Liverpool\u000a      College pupils in Years 7 and 9 before and after our three-week Philosophy\u000a      and PSHE course in\u000a      February 2012. In terms of significance, the results demonstrate that the\u000a      project significantly\u000a      increased self-esteem, defined as \"a child's appraisal of his or\u000a      her own worth [...] closely linked\u000a      with self-confidence [...] important for a healthy, happy life\", and life-satisfaction,\u000a      \"a global measure\u000a      of a child's overall happiness or satisfaction where the child rates his\u000a      or her life\". In particular, the\u000a      average self-esteem score of the group relative to the national\u000a      base line increased from 51.4%\u000a      before the intervention, to 59.4% after, while life-satisfaction increased\u000a      from 49.5% to 55%. With\u000a      regards to self-esteem, the results were statistically significant\u000a      to 99.6% confidence, while with life-satisfaction\u000a      to 95.5% confidence. According to NPC, this means that we can be very\u000a      confident\u000a      (99.6% and 95.5% certain) that the changes are not just due to chance.\u000a    Wishing to correlate subjective wellbeing with end-users' evaluation of\u000a      the academic merits\u000a      of the project, we gathered responses from the 110 participating pupils to\u000a      an anonymous\u000a      questionnaire developed in consultation with NPC. The results demonstrated\u000a      that 83% agree or\u000a      strongly agree that the lessons were interesting and 74% agree or strongly\u000a      agree that they want to\u000a      have similar lessons in the future. Given the statistical significance and\u000a      correlation of these results,\u000a      the next priority for the project was to ensure that changes in the\u000a      subjective wellbeing of this target\u000a      group would inform changes in objective wellbeing, namely, educational\u000a      policy and practice, thus\u000a      expanding the significance of the project and its reach to national and\u000a      international users.\u000a    (ii) Changes in Objective wellbeing indicators:\u000a    The impact was also captured by changes in educational policy and\u000a      practice in schools and\u000a      cultural institutions, further supported by testimonials, all attesting to\u000a      an increase in objective\u000a      wellbeing via the enrichment of young persons' educational opportunities\u000a      for self-reflection,\u000a      dialogue and cultural engagement. These changes provide the mechanism to\u000a      ensure that the\u000a      changes in subjective wellbeing evidenced above will be long-lasting and\u000a      sustainable.\u000a    (a)Schools: In September 2012, Liverpool College\u000a      established the Philosophy and PSHE lessons\u000a      as an annual programme, and introduced Arete, a unique programme\u000a      replacing Religious\u000a      Studies: its educational priorities (as a space for reflection), the\u000a      topics it covers (conscience,\u000a      virtue, community) and its mode of delivery were the direct effect of\u000a      teachers' exposure to the\u000a      Lyceum Project pedagogy and the student-demand reflected in the\u000a      survey results above for\u000a      'similar lessons in the future'. Furthermore, H. Broekman, Principal of\u000a      Liverpool College,\u000a      comments, \"The Philosophy students who teach at our school have provided\u000a      intellectual rigour\u000a      and a lot of creativity. They have improved the school and enthused our\u000a      pupils\". D. McLaughlin,\u000a      Liverpool School Improvement Team EYFS, states: \"This philosophical\u000a      approach made me\u000a      reflect on my planned work ... will use it to get practitioners to reflect\u000a      as they work with children\".\u000a      With reference to our electronic resources accessed through ODS, M.\u000a      Fragaki, Headteacher\u000a      and trainer at the ICT Institute, Ministry of Education, Greece, writes:\u000a      \"they are unique and\u000a      stimulating, I have strongly recommended them for use in the Citizenship\u000a      lessons taught in my\u000a      school ... I will also be using these learning objects and ideas in the\u000a      teacher-training\u000a      programme I lead\". Dr A. Abu-Dayyeh, member of the UNESCO committee for\u000a      teaching\u000a      philosophy to children in four continents, has used our resources in\u000a      schools in Jordan and\u000a      identifies the Lyceum Project's contribution to UNESCO's aims as\u000a      `empower[ing] young people\u000a      to integrate in multicultural societies'.\u000a    (b) Cultural Institutions: As a result of the formal\u000a      inclusion of the Philosophy and Art workshops in\u000a      the Biennial's official programme of events (2012), a number of new\u000a      partners in the local area\u000a      came forward to be involved with the developing methodology. Hence, the\u000a      initial sessions led\u000a      not only to further collaboration with Liverpool Biennial, but also the\u000a      production of new tailor-made\u000a      workshops for The Bluecoat, National Museums Liverpool, FACT, and METAL.\u000a      These\u000a      new opportunities were developed under an AHRC Cultural Engagement award\u000a      (2\/2013-5\/2013)\u000a      with additional funding from the School of the Arts. The partnerships led\u000a      to the inclusion\u000a      of the Lyceum Project's methodology in the educational programmes\u000a      of the above institutions,\u000a      thereby changing their practice in this regard. Furthermore, the\u000a      contribution of the Lyceum\u000a        Project to their educational programmes was co-developed in\u000a      consultation meetings with these\u000a      leading institutions, and input from the meetings, as well as\u000a      self-assessment of the project by\u000a      the AHRC post-doctoral researcher (February-May 2013), fed back into the\u000a      refinement and\u000a      development of the methodology, so that it best reflected end-users needs.\u000a      A national\u000a      conference co-hosted by The Bluecoat (June 2013) brought together\u000a      theorists, educators,\u000a      curators, policy makers and artists and allowed for co-ordination of\u000a      educational strategies,\u000a      better understanding of user requirements, and increased awareness of the\u000a      links between\u000a      education and children wellbeing. Further evidence of the project's\u000a      contribution to local\u000a      educational programmes is given by the CEO Liverpool Biennial, who\u000a      comments on volunteers\u000a      and staff from the Department: \"They bring an informed and intelligent\u000a      approach to their work\u000a      and play a vital role in the delivery of the Biennial\" and from a parent's\u000a      point of view R. Clark,\u000a      states that she will \"definitely guide her children's engagement with art\u000a      differently as a result of\u000a      this workshop\"; and agrees that our workshop enabled her children to\u000a      reflect more on what art\u000a      means to them and \"helped them learn the importance of others' opinions\".\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Lyceum Project is an original programme, introduced in 2012\u000a      and led by Vassilopoulou,\u000a      disseminating and further developing departmental research in\u000a      philosophical pedagogy with the\u000a      aim to positively impact on children's wellbeing. Our distinctive\u000a      methodology for teaching\u000a      philosophy, applicable to both curricular and extra-curricular contexts,\u000a      promotes self-reflection,\u000a      creativity, rationality, and cultural engagement, all decisive factors in\u000a      shaping children's self-understanding,\u000a      experiences, values, and aspirations. This case study describes the\u000a      programme's\u000a      impact (February 2012 - July 2013) on children's wellbeing, by capturing\u000a      changes effected in (a)\u000a      subjective wellbeing indicators with respect to the national\u000a      baseline, especially self-esteem and life\u000a      satisfaction, and (b) objective wellbeing indicators, especially\u000a      educational provision, policy, and\u000a      practice.

The specific insights\u000a      of this research that underpin the Lyceum Project methodology and\u000a      resources are: (i) the key role\u000a      of classical techniques of self-understanding in promoting philosophical\u000a      inquiry and self-reflection\u000a      as a means for normative self-realisation, (Vassilopoulou #6, McGhee #4,\u000a      Clark #1), (ii) the\u000a      constitutive role of metaphor and story-telling in learning, and the\u000a      pedagogical significance of\u000a      encouraging young learners to engage creatively with pervasive metaphors\u000a      embedded in\u000a      contemporary cultures (including artworks) thereby prompting questioning\u000a      and fresh re-evaluation\u000a      of cultural stereotypes, (Vassilopoulou #7&amp;8, Clark #2&amp;3). This\u000a      further leads to the empowerment\u000a      of young persons and their integration rather than assimilation in\u000a      contemporary multicultural\u000a      societies (McGhee, #5). The research findings that inform the Lyceum\u000a      methodology distinguish it\u000a      from previous methodologies for introducing philosophy to children that\u000a      concentrate primarily on\u000a      critical enquiry skills, without forging explicit links between these and\u000a      personal development, social\u000a      integration, or the appropriation of cultural heritage.\u000a    The motivation for the development of a teaching methodology on the basis\u000a      of this research is\u000a      provided by an issue of acute concern for the educational and cultural\u000a      sectors: as illustrated by the\u000a      results of the 2007\u000a        UN survey on the wellbeing of children in 21 economically advanced\u000a      countries.\u000a      The UK startlingly ranks last, with \"Educational Wellbeing\", \"Family\u000a      Relationships\" and \"Subjective\u000a      Wellbeing\", identified among the weaker dimensions. The Lyceum\u000a      methodology responds directly\u000a      to this by pursuing, with the help of the conceptual tools outlined above,\u000a      the link between children's\u000a      subjective and educational wellbeing both (1) within the school\u000a        curriculum and (2) in extra-curricular\u000a        contexts:\u000a    (1) Curricular: Philosophy and Personal, Social and Health\u000a          Education (PSHE). Since 2010,\u000a      PSHE has become a compulsory part of the national curriculum in\u000a      recognition of its importance for\u000a      \"promoting well-being\" and \"developing capabilities children and young\u000a      people need to flourish in\u000a      life and at work\" (`PSHE\u000a        Education - Briefing for voluntary and community organisations').\u000a      However, a recent comprehensive mapping survey funded by the Department\u000a      for Education and\u000a      conducted by Formby et al., (2011) highlights a recognised need\u000a      for substantial development in\u000a      PSHE's delivery method and resources, and identifies a lack of clear links\u000a      between personal\u000a      development and learning broadly defined (Report DFE-RR080, `PSHE\u000a        Education: A mapping\u000a        study of the prevalent models of delivery and their effectiveness').\u000a      This strand's objective is to\u000a      contribute methodology and resources to the teaching of PSHE in order to\u000a      address the above\u000a      problems.\u000a    (2) Extra-Curricular: Philosophy and Art for children and\u000a          families. While in recent years\u000a      museums and galleries have been developing a wealth of educational\u000a      programmes, there is a\u000a      clear absence of self-reflective methodology when engaging young children\u000a      and their families with\u000a      art. This strand's objective is to enhance the current educational\u000a      provision of museums and\u000a      galleries by creating resources tailor-made to the institutions'\u000a      collections, sharing best practice in\u000a      staff training sessions, as well as running in situ workshops for children\u000a      and families by introducing\u000a      them to a philosophically-informed mode of engagement with art that could\u000a      be reenacted during\u000a      their independent visits to museums. The methodology and resources were\u000a      further developed\u000a      through participatory research activities: consultation meetings with\u000a      external partners and a\u000a      practitioner-conference led to a refining and retuning of our research.\u000a    The development of the Lyceum's pedagogy along these two strands\u000a      makes it distinctive in that its\u000a      relevance is not limited to the teaching of philosophy as a distinct\u000a      subject, but extends to the\u000a      teaching of other subjects that are already part of the curriculum and\u000a      systematically reaches\u000a      beyond the classroom into the space of art institutions.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7831","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Delivery\u000a      Users benefited from this research through two mechanisms: (a) the\u000a      participatory research method by means of which the report (Religious\u000a        Discrimination and Symbolism: A Philosophical Perspective) was first\u000a      generated; (b) the community-engagement activities devised to ensure the\u000a      research findings influenced users.\u000a    (a): The report was written in consultation with significant stakeholders\u000a      in local faith-based communities (such as the Hindu Cultural Organization,\u000a      the Liverpool Muslim Society, Education Islam, the North-West Zoroastrian\u000a      Community, Chaplains at local universities and Coventry Multi- Faith\u000a      Forum) together with other local and national religious practitioners (the\u000a      former Anglican Bishop of Rochester, the Roman-Catholic Archbishop of\u000a      Liverpool, a council member of the National Secular Society, a member of\u000a      the British Humanist Association and representatives from Christian\u000a      Concern, the Evangelical Alliance and the National Council of Hindu\u000a      Temples), as well as legal practitioners (such as leading religious-rights\u000a      barrister Mark Hill QC) and key policy makers (including Charles Clarke,\u000a      the former Home Secretary, and employees from the Equality and Human\u000a      Rights Commission). It was then reviewed by leading policy makers,\u000a      including several members of Parliament, pressure groups, and legal\u000a      counsel involved in some of the key cases (Eweida v British Airways\u000a      and Chaplin v Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital), and revised in the\u000a      light of comments received.\u000a    (b): The findings of the report were disseminated through interviews\u000a      given by Hill to local radio stations, a public debate in Manchester and\u000a      the Philosophy\u000a          in the City public blog. Whistler and Hill also held meetings\u000a      with key participants in the high-profile Eweida, Chaplin,\u000a      McFarlane, and Ladele cases to further the reach of the\u000a      report. These participants included Paul Diamond (representing Chaplin and\u000a      McFarlane), representatives from the Christian Legal Centre, and the\u000a      applicants, Shirley Chaplin and Gary McFarlane.\u000a    Impact on Public Discourse: Participatory Research\u000a      The monograph, The Right to Wear Religious Symbols, is itself\u000a      evidence of the involvement and investment of users in the construction of\u000a      the research findings. In accordance with the participatory-research\u000a      methodology devised in Whistler and Hill's research, interactive\u000a      discussion of the core research question and the report's contents\u000a      provided a means not only to engage non- academic users in discussion, but\u000a      also to promote philosophical skills, such as analysis. This model is\u000a      currently being redeployed and expanded in the Philosophy and\u000a        Religious Practices research network.\u000a    The impact of such active research participation, as well as of the\u000a      research findings themselves, on public discourse by enriching both users'\u000a      awareness of the concepts specifically at issue in legal cases concerning\u000a      religious discrimination, and their religious literacy more generally, is\u000a      attested by an end-of-project questionnaire (completed in November 2012).\u000a      100% stated that participation had improved their understanding of recent\u000a      legal debates; 100%, that it had improved their understanding of public\u000a      discussions surrounding religious discrimination; and 100%, that their\u000a      understanding of the role of symbolism in faith communities had been\u000a      improved. Participants spoke of gaining \"a much better knowledge of the\u000a      law and the practices of various faiths\", of gaining \"a greater depth of\u000a      understanding of the reasons for different religious practices in the UK\"\u000a      and \"better insight into the reasoning of the courts\". For many users,\u000a      this change in awareness also had transformative significance: 63%\u000a      maintained that participation in the research project had \"changed the way\u000a      they thought\" about issues surrounding religious discrimination.\u000a    Impact on Civil Life: Practice and Policy\u000a      After engaging with the disseminated findings, many new users recorded\u000a      changes in their religious literacy in connection with the project's\u000a      research findings, e.g. its identification of a `practical turn' in recent\u000a      European case rulings and conceptual analysis of that turn. 88% of those\u000a      responding to the end-of-project questionnaire found that the project had\u000a      significantly \"made a difference to their understanding\" of debates\u000a      surrounding religious discrimination.\u000a    This figure includes representatives from all the beneficiaries of the\u000a      project: religious practitioners, legal practitioners, and policy makers.\u000a      Of the religious practitioners, Michael Nazir-Ali, the former Bishop of\u000a      Rochester, spoke of the report as a resource to \"be widely used to promote\u000a      religious literacy in our common life\" and furthermore hoped that it would\u000a      be \"available to the employers, the employment tribunals and the courts\"\u000a      making decisions on the protection of religious symbols. Representatives\u000a      of a leading organisation for the raising of awareness of Islam in the UK,\u000a      Education Islam, also said that the report had been extremely\u000a      helpful for their future work. Of the legal practitioners, Mark Hill QC, a\u000a      leading barrister at Francis Taylor Buildings Chambers, spoke of being\u000a      \"delighted\" at the legal significance of the report, which, he added,\u000a      would be \"a matter of great interest\" to lawyers in the UK. And from the\u000a      policy makers involved in the project, Charles Clarke, the former Home\u000a      Secretary and Secretary of State for Education, described the report as\u000a      \"extremely valuable\" for rethinking policy in this area, and David Perfect\u000a      of the Equality and Human Rights Commission called the report \"very\u000a      useful\" for two policy projects on religion or belief being undertaken by\u000a      the EHRC in 2013. (All of these testimonials were collated in\u000a      Summer\/Autumn 2012.)\u000a    Only three months after the project finished, already a quarter of those\u000a      completing the end-of- project questionnaire claimed that they had put\u000a        the findings into practice outside the project. That is, the\u000a      project, having accomplished its aim to raise awareness, and offer new\u000a      understanding, of key concepts underlying the debate around religious\u000a      discrimination, also led to changes in practice in civil life on the basis\u000a      of its findings.\u000a    One significant example of such a change in practice took place at\u000a      Network Rail's Professional Equalities Training for Workforce-Development\u000a      Specialists in York in July 2012. A presenter at this meeting, who was\u000a      also a religious-practitioner participant in the Religious Symbolism\u000a        and Discrimination project, made substantial use of the findings of\u000a      the project in both the oral presentation that he gave on religious\u000a      symbolism in the workplace and also in printed material that he produced\u000a      for the team members. His presentation on this component of equalities\u000a      training was significantly altered through engaging with the research, and\u000a      he was subsequently asked to join the Inter-Faith Network at Network Rail.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Religious Symbolism and Discrimination project consists of a\u000a      body of research in the philosophy of religion that has effected changes\u000a      in practice and awareness among religious practitioners, legal\u000a      practitioners, and policy makers both within the North-West of England and\u000a      nationally.

In the light of recent public and media controversy over the rights\u000a      of individuals to wear religious symbols (such as crosses, niq&#257;bs, karas,\u000a      and chastity rings) in the public sphere, its core research question ran,\u000a      `when, if ever, is it acceptable to prohibit the use of religious\u000a      symbols?'. This question was answered by means of a two-fold research\u000a      methodology: a philosophical analysis of the concepts underlying debates\u000a      on religious discrimination (for example, the concepts of symbol and\u000a      belief), and participatory research into how these concepts are employed\u000a      by religious and legal practitioners and policy makers. The project\u000a      consisted of two elements, and the resulting monograph, The Right to\u000a        Wear Religious Symbols (Palgrave 2013), contains:\u000a    (a) a detailed account of the analytical research underpinning the\u000a      project;\u000a    (b) evidence of the participatory methodology carried out with research\u000a      users.\u000a    Formulation of Participatory Research Methodology\u000a      The project's innovative combination of theoretical methods and\u000a      participatory research follows the programme set out by Whistler in his\u000a      contribution to the Speculative Philosophies and Religious Practices\u000a      issue of Political Theology (2012), which develops a conception of\u000a      philosophy of religion as community-based research. On this model,\u000a      user-participation is not an extrinsic end-process conducted once research\u000a      answers have already been formulated, but an intrinsic component of the\u000a      philosophising. This research contributes to a reconceptualisation of the\u000a      practice of philosophy of religion, making it more responsive to lived\u000a      religion, and is now being further developed in Whistler's AHRC network, Philosophy\u000a        and Religious Practices (in collaboration with the University of\u000a      Chester, Liverpool Hope University, and local faith groups), which runs\u000a      from January 2013 to May 2014.\u000a    Research Findings\u000a      The underpinning philosophical analysis of concepts in Article 9 of the\u000a      European Convention of Human Rights found in The Right to Wear\u000a        Religious Symbols derives in part from research undertaken by\u000a      Whistler, particularly Schelling's Theory of Symbolic Language\u000a      (OUP 2013; the majority of the research carried out since Whistler joined\u000a      the University of Liverpool in October 2010; some background research\u000a      carried out at the University of Oxford prior to this date). Redeploying\u000a      the philosophical material collected in Schelling's Theory of Symbolic\u000a        Language, the research finds that a proper understanding of\u000a      symbolism would provide, significantly, a better theoretical framework for\u000a      the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. In particular,\u000a      Whistler and Hill argue that this jurisprudence has recently turned away\u000a      from interpreting the various uses of symbols solely in the light of\u000a      high-level, antecedent beliefs manifested by them to seeing them as\u000a      practices in their own right. This is developed in two ways:\u000a    (i) through a reading of the philosophical literature on symbols that\u000a      focuses on their capacity to create meaning independently of\u000a      belief-expression;\u000a    (ii) through a move away from looking at the uses of symbols in relation\u000a      to high-level theoretical belief systems (such as religions) in favour of\u000a      seeing them as expressions of low-level practical beliefs.\u000a    Against the background of public unease at the task of balancing the\u000a      rights of the individual to wear religious symbols and the rights of\u000a      others, culminating in the recent Strasbourg court case Eweida v UK,\u000a      the significance of the project as a whole lies in its use of the tools of\u000a      philosophy of religion to engage with the anxieties of specific religious\u000a      and secular communities, something which UK philosophy of religion has\u000a      rarely done. Evidence of this lack is how little work has been undertaken\u000a      on the way in which analyses of core religious concepts might benefit\u000a      policy and public debate. Trigg's Religion in Public Life (OUP\u000a      2007) and Equality, Freedom and Religion (OUP 2012) are alone in\u000a      doing this; however, the Religious Symbolism and Discrimination\u000a      project differs from Trigg's in its methodology.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8319","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact was initially focused on localities in Leeds and West\u000a      Yorkshire, with University staff and students working together with museum\u000a      professionals to optimise the educational potential of science, technology\u000a      and medicine collections through geographically informed research.\u000a      Subsequently, the adaptation of similar research-based approaches in the\u000a      museums sector on a national scale has built on the success of these\u000a      initiatives,including further collaborations and the development of public\u000a      learning resources\u000a    A) Yorkshire Museums and their Staff\u000a    Through strategic targeting of funding, especially of the AHRC's CDA\u000a      scheme, Gooday, Topham and Radick developed collaborations\u000a      with curators and other museum professionals to train Leeds- based PhD\u000a      students.

Using its pathology records, Finn has shown how the asylum's daily\u000a      practices were interwoven with research on brain function which made it\u000a      famous in the 1870s. In a post-project interview, it was reported that\u000a      Finn's research \"had bolstered work on constructing a business case to\u000a        advocate support for the museum\", and that, \"the museum is now\u000a        able to develop interpretation that juxtaposes historical with\u000a        contemporary experiences of mental health treatment.\" Finn has\u000a      continued this collaboration with AHRC impact funding.

On\u000a      this view, it makes no difference where an observation is made, or a\u000a      theory formulated, or a claim about nature considered, because scientific\u000a      knowledge is universally true. Challenging this customary dismissal has\u000a      been one of the most important developments in historical writing about\u000a      science, technology and medicine in the last quarter century. Researchers\u000a      at the University of Leeds, in particular Graeme Gooday (at Leeds\u000a      since 1994) and Jonathan Topham (at Leeds since 1999), have been\u000a      at the forefront of these developments.\u000a    Beginning with a now-classic 1998 paper on how nineteenth-century\u000a      laboratory scientists made their labs credible as windows onto reality (1),\u000a      Gooday has steadily expanded his interest in place, most recently\u000a      in studies of the role of apparently non-scientific locales in the rise of\u000a      electrical technology. He has shown, for example, how surprisingly\u000a      important theatres and aristocratic homes were in Britain in the\u000a      late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century as places that glamorized\u000a      electric lighting (2) while also serving to reassure (albeit also\u000a      occasionally alarm) the public about the risks (3). Electricity\u000a      was thus \"domesticated\" twice over, for it was only through the\u000a      electrification of such places that many people came to think of\u000a      electricity as unthreatening.\u000a    Topham's primary research agenda, laid out in a widely cited\u000a      historiographical paper published in 2000 (4), has been to explore\u000a      the critical role of the processes and practices of print communication in\u000a      understanding the acceptance, rejection, and appropriation of scientific\u000a      knowledge claims in different localities. His most recent paper in this\u000a      area examines the difficulties of interchange between Britain and France\u000a      during the Napoleonic wars, showing how British responses to French work\u000a      were conditioned by what Topham calls the \"technicians of print\":\u000a      the typically non-scientific people, from publishers and printers to\u000a      booksellers and translators, whose locally variable practices conditioned\u000a      what got to be read by whom and in what form (5). In common with Topham's\u000a      other studies, this paper has contributed to a reorientation towards\u000a      understanding knowledge-making in science as a process that is inherently\u000a      spatial.\u000a    Gregory Radick (at Leeds since 2000), has also engaged with\u000a      place, notably in an award-winning book on the origin-of-language debates\u000a      since Darwin (6). This was original in emphasizing experiments in\u000a      \"the field\" &#8212; here, the African landscapes inhabited by monkeys &#8212; as the\u000a      source of authority in resolving debates about the origins of language.\u000a    To advance their collective concern with place in science, Gooday,\u000a        Radick and Topham in 2006 initiated two long-term projects\u000a      that have turned Leeds itself into a kind of research laboratory for\u000a      testing the value of this geographic approach to scientific knowledge. One\u000a      is a growing set of collaborative relationships with Leeds-area museums (i-iii).\u000a      The other is the creation of a University of Leeds Museum of the History\u000a      of Science, Technology and Medicine (`Leeds HSTM Museum'), making use of\u000a      University collections within public displays and education events, both\u000a      on and off campus (iv).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8338","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Informed through their research, Cain and Boulter utilise this commitment\u000a      to essentialism to help\u000a      enable improved education outcomes for school children.

The sessions are highly targeted,\u000a      focussing on topics of real life\u000a      significance (for example, the role and legitimacy of stereotyping in\u000a      everyday life, the extent of an\u000a      individual's responsibility for their own educational and professional\u000a      success, the meaning and\u000a      extent of discrimination in contemporary Britain, the legitimacy of\u000a      positive discrimination, and so\u000a      on).The ultimate aim of the sessions is to boost the confidence and\u000a      academic aspirations of the\u000a      students so that they are more likely to apply to strive to go to\u000a      university and are more ambitious in\u000a      their applications.\u000a    Cain has now completed a first year of working at Highcrest and has had\u000a      extensive debriefing\u000a      conversations with the Assistant Headteacher. On the basis of interviewing\u000a      the students involved in\u000a      the Philosophical Enquiry sessions she has concluded that significant\u000a      positive benefit has taken\u000a      place for those involved. All of the students have been stimulated by the\u000a      sessions and this has lead\u000a      to a general rise in intellectual confidence, the ability to reason\u000a      logically, and the capacity to\u000a      engage in independent learning. In addition, the sessions have had a\u000a      transforming effect on a\u000a      number of students who had been identified by the school as highly able\u000a      but underachieving due to\u000a      a lack of confidence. These students are now firmly committed to applying\u000a      to go to University,\u000a      something that they hadn't previously envisaged doing. As a result of the\u000a      success of the\u000a      Philosophical Enquiry sessions this academic year Highcrest have invited\u000a      Cain to continue the\u000a      sessions next academic year with a broader range of students and view the\u000a      sessions as an\u000a      important element of their drive to increase the proportion of their\u000a      students who go to University.\u000a    In addition to the work with Highcrest Academy, Cain and Boulter have\u000a      built a relationship with a\u000a      second school, namely Chenderit School in Banbury. For the past two\u000a      academic years the head of\u000a      Philosophy at Chenderit school, has brought a group of 15 A Level\u000a      Philosophy students on an\u000a      annual day-trip to Brookes where they have engaged in a Philosophical\u000a      Enquiry session lead by\u000a      Boulter; the enquiry sessions are underpinned by Boulter's metaphilosophy\u000a      in that they explore\u000a      tensions in the world view of the students that have real life\u000a      implications through their relation to\u000a      issues of individual responsibility, fairness, moral conflict, pluralism,\u000a      social inequality, and so on.\u000a      As a result of the success of these sessions in boosting the engagement\u000a      and intellectual\u000a      confidence of the Chenderit students, Philosophical Enquiry has been\u000a      incorporated into the\u000a      Chenderit approach to teaching Philosophy at A level.\u000a    The success of this has led Chenderit, under the instigation of Head of\u000a      Philosophy, to initiate a\u000a      project of using Philosophical Enquiry throughout the school (beginning\u000a      with year 7 students) to\u000a      boost the capacity for reasoning and independence of thought of all\u000a      students that aims to address\u000a      Chenderit's concern that many of its students are not fully fledged\u000a      independent learners operating\u000a      with enquiring minds Chenderit have invited Cain and Boulter to\u000a      collaborate on this project and\u000a      they have met with school representatives to devise a syllabus which will\u000a      be implemented from\u000a      September 2013 and Cain will work with the school in supervising the\u000a      project and will lead some of\u000a      the sessions.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Philosophical Enquiry, informed by excellent research to explore the\u000a      metaphysical core of\u000a      essentialism, has enabled educational benefits to secondary school\u000a      children through improved\u000a      social mobility and supporting the development intellectually enquiring\u000a      minds.

Given this\u000a      causal relationship between essential and observable properties,\u000a      categorizing an object on the\u000a      basis of its observable properties will usually result in its being\u000a      assigned to the correct fundamental\u000a      category. However, such a procedure falls short of being fool proof as it\u000a      is possible for an entity to\u000a      have the observable properties typical of a member of a particular\u000a      fundamental category without\u000a      having the relevant essence. Dr Stephen Boulter (Senior Lecturer, Oxford\u000a      Brookes University,\u000a      2000 - Present) holds this to be a plausible metaphysical position and a\u000a      key element of his\u000a      research involves arguing for it. In particular, he argues that it has a\u000a      firm basis in commonsense1\u000a      and is supported by evolutionary considerations. Dr Mark Cain (Principal\u000a      Lecturer, Oxford Brookes\u000a      University, 2002 - Present) is interested in the idea that children are\u000a      innately essentialist, an idea\u000a      that has a lot of support in contemporary developmental psychology. This\u000a      idea is known as\u000a      psychological essentialism and one of Cain's research interests lies in\u000a      examining the implications\u000a      of psychological essentialism on a range of philosophical issues2, 3.\u000a    Together Cain and Boulter's research suggests that essentialism is a\u000a      prominent element of our\u000a      distinctively human perspective on reality. Being neither culturally nor\u000a      historically specific it is a key\u000a      element of human nature that is particularly prominent in childhood. In\u000a      addition, Boulter researches\u000a      in the area of Metaphilosophy where he has developed a distinctive view of\u000a      philosophy according\u000a      to which the concern of the discipline is to resolve tensions that emerge\u000a      from the clash of prima\u000a        facie inconsistent aspects of our general world view3.\u000a    Cain and Boulter's published research explores the metaphysical core of\u000a      essentialism which is\u000a      constituted by the idea that the essence of a thing is the causal basis of\u000a      its readily perceivable\u000a      surface properties. They argue that this metaphysical core has an\u000a      important consequence with\u000a      respect to the categorisation dispositions of ordinary people: one the one\u000a      hand, ordinary people\u000a      typically decide what type of thing something is on the basis of its\u000a      surface properties, but, on the\u000a      other hand, they recognise that surface properties can sometimes be\u000a      misleading as to what\u000a      something is and are therefore prepared to revise their categorisation\u000a      judgements if suitably\u000a      prompted.\u000a    Cain and Boulter draw out an implication of their account of essentialism\u000a      and its influence on the\u000a      categorisation dispositions of ordinary people to provide an explanation\u000a      of the social phenomenon\u000a      described earlier in this section. According to that explanation,\u000a      essentialism predisposes working\u000a      class children to view their surface properties as indicating their true\u000a      nature. Hence, they see their\u000a      own accent, social background, and such like as indicating that they have\u000a      an essence that makes\u000a      them ill-suited to higher education. However, their essentialism also\u000a      provides them with the\u000a      resources to overcome such a restricting outlook. For, if working class\u000a      children can be encouraged\u000a      to reason about the significance of their surface properties they can be\u000a      steered towards the\u000a      conclusion that such properties do not indicate their true nature,\u000a      particularly with respect to their\u000a      intellectual potential. From Boulter's metaphilosophical perspective this\u000a      is an example of a tension\u000a      generated by our everyday world view that can be resolved by philosophical\u000a      means.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8843","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"433561","Name":"Burundi"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In November 2009 Dr Ord founded the organisation Giving What We Can.\u000a      This organisation is dedicated to the fight against poverty in the\u000a      developing world. Its members pledge to give at least 10% of their income\u000a      to aid and to direct their giving to the organisations that have a\u000a      demonstrated ability to use their incomes most efficiently. The most\u000a      significant impact of his research is the amount of money pledged by the\u000a      326 members of this organisation: over US $130,000,000. (One notable\u000a      member is the philanthropist Dr Fred Mulder, who visited the organisation\u000a      in 2013 and who was sufficiently impressed by the passion and energy of\u000a      those working in it that he announced in a public lecture that very\u000a      evening that he would donate &#163;180,000 to the organisation, together with\u000a      &#163;80,000 over the next three years.) The money pledged has the potential to\u000a      save lives. In fact, if we accept an estimate in Disease Control\u000a        Priorities in Developing Countries, the amount pledged is enough to\u000a      save nearly 57,000 lives[i].\u000a    There is also a highly successful offshoot organisation called `80,000\u000a      hours', encouraging people to pursue careers that will enable them to\u000a      become more effective altruists[ii]. This was created by\u000a      graduate and undergraduate students in Oxford, but now has active support\u000a      throughout the world: its Director of Careers Research, its Career Impact\u000a      Assessor, and the person developing its on-line social network are all\u000a      working in American universities. Not long after these two organisations\u000a      had been established, they&#8212;along with two others, Effective Animal\u000a        Activism and The Life You Can Save&#8212;were united to constitute\u000a      the Centre for Effective Altruism[iii]. This Centre has\u000a      been a registered charity since 2012 and is now supported by six full time\u000a      team members, including staff and interns. Giving What We Can has\u000a      itself now grown to the extent that it has chapters not only at Oxford but\u000a      also at Cambridge, Princeton, Harvard, Rutgers, UC San Diego, Warwick,\u000a      Canberra, Switzerland, and Birmingham: these are local branches of the\u000a      organisation working in areas where there is a high density of people\u000a      interested in working together to promote its goals[iv].\u000a    Dr Ord provides ongoing advice on ethics and cost-effectiveness to Oxfam\u000a      Great Britain, and consultation on cost-effective ways to fight disease to\u000a      Oxford Analytica. He also wrote a chapter of a report for the Centre for\u000a      Global Development, launched at the House of Lords in 2012, and has had\u000a      talks with a special adviser to the Prime Minister, with the Secretary of\u000a      State for International Development, and with the World Health\u000a      Organisation[v]. In April 2013, he participated in a\u000a      working group of the World Health Organisation tasked with writing a\u000a      handbook on ethical advice for setting up universal coverage health\u000a      systems in developing countries: this handbook will include a special\u000a      emphasis in the cost-effectiveness that he advocates. That same month he\u000a      also met representatives of the World Bank to discuss the possibility of\u000a      the World Bank's undertaking a major project to set global priorities[vi].\u000a      Owen Barder, a senior fellow at the Centre for Global Development, said in\u000a      an interview in 2012, `One thing I have learned working in this industry\u000a      is that there is a tendency to [promote]... all these different good\u000a      causes...

This work\u000a      convinced him that the most important objects of assessment, within a\u000a      consequentialist framework, are not individual acts, but long-term\u000a      commitments. He argued that, by prioritizing long-term commitments in this\u000a      way, the consequentialist is able to bypass the somewhat arid\u000a      preoccupation that consequentialists and other moral theorists have tended\u000a      to have in the past with questions about which acts are impermissible,\u000a      which merely permissible, which obligatory, and which supererogatory. Dr\u000a      Ord also came to see that this in turn could have important practical\u000a      repercussions. In particular, it helps us to see that a single long-term\u000a      commitment to a cause not only avoids the burdens of continual one-off\u000a      decision-making in pursuit of that cause, it is also more effective, since\u000a      second-guessing about the effects of individual spending decisions is\u000a      largely futile. It also gives us a better understanding than act-based\u000a      consequentialism of what is wrong with not donating to charity: an\u000a      act-based consequentialist will find it hard to single out any particular\u000a      act of the non-donator as relevantly wrong.\u000a    While exploring these general structural issues, Dr Ord also considered\u000a      some more specific questions that would later bear directly on the\u000a      founding of the organisation Giving What We Can. He discovered\u000a      powerful and compelling new arguments why those of us who enjoy a certain\u000a      basic quality of life should give a significant proportion of our income\u000a      to poor people in developing countries. Some of these arguments addressed\u000a      hitherto unexplored questions about the phenomenology of moral conflict;\u000a      some took the form of counterarguments to the less demanding theories of\u000a      Richard Miller and Liam Murphy. This led him to the idea of setting an\u000a      achievable public standard of giving away 10% of one's income. Such a\u000a      standard, which is anticipated in the old practice of tithing, is both\u000a      less demanding and more intuitive than various others that a\u000a      consequentialist might be expected to set, which in turn means that it is\u000a      more likely to be followed. It is less demanding in the sense that it\u000a      creates a fixed allowance within which to live, free of the guilt and\u000a      self-censure that accompanies a life that is a constant and frequently\u000a      unsuccessful struggle to avoid luxuries. It is more intuitive in the sense\u000a      that it chimes better with our pre-theoretical convictions about how we\u000a      should live.\u000a    In 2009, during the early stages of his postdoctoral research fellowship,\u000a      Dr Ord was inspired to carry out some of the more empirical research that\u000a      would help him to convert his theoretical conclusions into something more\u000a      practical. In the course of this research, he debunked various myths about\u000a      aid, for example that it has no effect or is even counterproductive. He\u000a      also came to acknowledge a significant moral imperative to donate to the\u000a      most effective organisations, which led him to investigate the\u000a      cost-effectiveness of various interventions. In 2012, he wrote an article,\u000a      `The Moral Imperative Towards Cost-Effectiveness', in which he both argued\u000a      for and clarified this imperative. He made comparisons between charities,\u000a      and produced a list of charities that were particularly recommended for\u000a      their cost-effectiveness. At around the same time, Andreas Mogensen\u000a      provided additional relevant research in his article `Giving Without\u000a      Sacrifice?', in which he explored connections between income, happiness,\u000a      and giving, and argued that giving to charity is not only of benefit to\u000a      the recipients but also, in a variety of unexpected ways, to the donors.\u000a      The upshot is a set of powerfully interlocking arguments, some conceptual,\u000a      some empirical, some a mixture, which between them present a forceful case\u000a      for making the pledge that is the defining characteristic of Giving\u000a        What We Can.\u000a    From 2006, Dr Ord acted as a research associate both for the Uehiro\u000a      Centre for Practical Ethics and for the Future of Humanity Institute. He\u000a      has been a postdoctoral research fellow in the University of Oxford since\u000a      2009. Mr Mogensen has been a Fellow of All Souls College Oxford since\u000a      2010.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8850","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Professor Bostrom's work has led to his being invited to play a large\u000a      number of advisory and\u000a      consultation roles, to government departments, major insurance companies,\u000a      and other institutions,\u000a      and this in turn has led to his work's having a large impact on policy. In\u000a      2009, he advised Booz\u000a      Allen, a strategy and technology consulting firm. That same year, he\u000a      advised a joint meeting of the\u000a      Royal Society and the International Council of Life Sciences on biomedical\u000a      risk: the Royal Society\u000a      published a report from that meeting which was subsequently circulated to\u000a      the Presidential\u000a      Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues.

And that same year he advised Digital Sky\u000a      Technologies concerning\u000a      talking points for a roundtable discussion between its Chief Executive\u000a      Officer, Yuri Milner, and the\u000a      leaders of the G8 countries for the 37th Annual G8 Leaders\u000a      Summit in Deauville. The advice that\u000a      he gave Amlin Insurance impressed them to such an extent that they\u000a      subsequently contributed\u000a      &#163;900,000 towards funding a collaborative research project between them and\u000a      the Future of\u000a      Humanity Institute to investigate systemic risk.\u000a    Professor Bostrom has marshalled his ideas to give practical advice in\u000a      several other ways. He is\u000a      on the Advisory Board of the Singularity Institute, which aims to bring\u000a      rational analysis and rational\u000a      strategy to the challenges facing humanity and which holds an annual\u000a      summit to coordinate and\u000a      educate those concerned with these challenges.[iv] He\u000a      co-founded the Institute for Ethics and\u000a      Emerging Technology, whose mission is to be a centre for voices arguing\u000a      for a responsible\u000a      approach to the most powerful emerging technologies.[v]\u000a      He also founded the Existential Risk\u000a      Reduction Career Network, a community whose members discuss the strengths\u000a      and weaknesses\u000a      of different careers in terms of existential risk, share advice on job\u000a      applications and career\u000a      advancement, help one another to find interviews, and suchlike.\u000a    In July 2008, Professor Bostrom organised a conference entitled `Global\u000a      Catastrophic Risks',\u000a      concerned with the various ideas that were eventually published in that\u000a      same year in the collection\u000a      of the same name.[vi] Several of the conference's\u000a      participants had significant non-academic\u000a      profiles. They included: Joseph Cirincione, President of the Ploughshare\u000a      Fund, a foundation\u000a      dedicated to the reduction of nuclear proliferation; Chris Phoenix and\u000a      Mike Tredor, co-founders of\u000a      the Centre for Responsible Nanotechnology, an organisation whose mission\u000a      is to raise awareness\u000a      of, and to expedite the thorough examination of, the benefits and dangers\u000a      of advanced\u000a      nanotechnology, and to assist in the creation and implementation of the\u000a      responsible use of such\u000a      technology; and Sir Crispin Tickell, Director of the Policy Foresight\u000a      Programme at the James\u000a      Martin School. There was extensive coverage of this conference in New\u000a        Scientist, Reason Online,\u000a      The Scotsman, Earth and Sky, and CNN.\u000a    A significant additional part of the impact of Professor Bostrom's\u000a      research derives from the way in\u000a      which he has drawn the issues of existential risk to people's attention.\u000a      (For instance, his work has\u000a      inspired the setting up of an existential risk research centre in\u000a      Cambridge, for which he serves as\u000a      an external advisor.) He has disseminated his ideas widely through the\u000a      media in a way that has\u000a      attracted considerable public debate. Among the highly distinguished\u000a      public lectures and other\u000a      public presentations that he has given on these issues since 2008 are the\u000a      following:\u000a    \u000a      a keynote address to the Global Catastrophic Risks Conference in 2008;\u000a      the opening presentation at the Policy Foresight Programme Workshop in\u000a        2008;\u000a      a discussion with Sir Martin Rees at the Science Foo Camp, organised\u000a        by Nature, Google,\u000a        and O'Reilly Media in 2008;\u000a      the opening keynote address to the Guardian Activate Summit in 2009;\u000a      a talk to the Chancellor's Court of Benefactors in 2009;\u000a      a talk to the Future Scenarios Seminar run jointly by the\u000a        International Centre for Community\u000a        Development, the European Centre for Jewish Leadership, and the American\u000a        Jewish Joint\u000a        Distribution Committee in 2010;\u000a      a panel contribution to the Leaders of Change Summit in the Istanbul\u000a        World Political Forum\u000a        in 2011;\u000a      a keynote address at a Global Futures Forum workshop on\u000a        transformational technologies,\u000a        partly under the auspices of the US Department of State and the Italian\u000a        Intelligence\u000a        Community, in 2012.\u000a    \u000a    Since 2008, Professor Bostrom has also been interviewed on the issues of\u000a      existential risk by\u000a      (among others) the Discovery Channel for Canadian television, New\u000a        Scientist, The Scotsman,\u000a      Epoca (the premier Brazilian news weekly), Kultur Zeit for German\u000a      television, Time, Die Zeit, the\u000a      History Channel and Bloomberg News for American television, Time\u000a        Magazine, Bayerischer\u000a      Rundfunk for German radio, ABC, i (a Portuguese newspaper), World\u000a        Affairs Monthly, Il Sole 24\u000a        Ore (an Italian monthly magazine), Utbildningsradion (a Swedish\u000a      Educational Broadcasting\u000a      Company), The Times Online Magazine, The Guardian, Science\u000a        &amp; Vie, Scientific American[vii],\u000a      Bloomsberg Buisnessweek,[viii] The Economist,\u000a      the BBC (television and radio), Aeon (a digital\u000a      magazine with an online blog which in this case attracted very many\u000a      enthusiastic comments) and\u000a      Huffpost Line[x] (an online journal that reaches 27\u000a      million monthly viewers) as well as in the\u000a      documentary film Transhuman by Titus Nachbauer[xi].\u000a      An interview for The Atlantic,[xii] despite\u000a      being over 5,000 words long, received over half a million reads, was\u000a      shared over 6,000 times in\u000a      social media (Google+, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter) and made the front\u000a      cover of Reddit.

The period since 2006, when he became Director of the\u000a      Future Of Humanity\u000a      Institute in the Oxford Martin School, has seen significant developments\u000a      in this research. Indeed,\u000a      one of the founding aims of the Institute was precisely to bring\u000a      interdisciplinary expertise to bear on\u000a      the research in an attempt to tackle questions of crucial importance to\u000a      humanity that had previously\u000a      received remarkably little attention within academia.\u000a    Professor Bostrom defines an `existential risk' as a certain sort of\u000a      global catastrophic risk: one that\u000a      threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life\u000a      or the permanent and drastic\u000a      destruction of its potential for desirable future development. His\u000a      research includes investigation\u000a      both of potential causes of such risks and of biases and other flaws in\u000a      how we think about them.\u000a    In the 2005 article `How Unlikely is a Doomsday Catastrophe?', which\u000a      Professor Bostrom co-authored\u000a      with Max Tegmark, the authors consider such extreme existential risks as a\u000a      breakdown of\u000a      a metastable vacuum state triggered by a microscopic black hole. They\u000a      argue that many previous\u000a      bounds on the frequency of such events give a false sense of security due\u000a      to a failure to take into\u000a      account the fact that observers are by definition in places lucky enough\u000a      to have avoided\u000a      destruction: the authors derive their own new upper bound. In his 2011\u000a      article `Information\u000a      Hazards' Professor Bostrom explores a quite different type of risk. By an\u000a      `information hazard' he\u000a      means a risk that arises from the dissemination or the potential\u000a      dissemination of information that\u000a      may directly or indirectly cause harm. He argues that such hazards are\u000a      often much more subtle\u000a      than physical threats, and that it is therefore easy for us to overlook\u000a      them, though they can be just\u000a      as serious as physical threats. In `Anthropic Shadow', Professor Bostrom\u000a      joins forces with Dr Milan\u000a      &#262;irkovi&#263; and Dr Anders Sandberg to explore limitations on our ability to\u000a      assess risks. In particular,\u000a      they focus on an observation selection effect&#8212;what they call the\u000a      `anthropic shadow'&#8212;that prevents\u000a      us from observing certain sorts of catastrophes in our recent geological\u000a      and evolutionary past. The\u000a      significance of this is that it creates a kind of second-order risk,\u000a      namely the risk of our significantly\u000a      underestimating the risk of any type of catastrophe that lies within the\u000a      shadow.\u000a    In his 2009 article `The Future of Humanity', Professor Bostrom explains\u000a      more generally the\u000a      importance of our considering the risks that attend our own future. He\u000a      first raises some very broad\u000a      issues about the nature of predictability, drawing attention to ways in\u000a      which the long-term future\u000a      can be easier to predict than the short-term future, then looks in\u000a      particular at the question of\u000a      whether our long-term future can be expected to be `post-human', in the\u000a      sense, roughly, that it can\u000a      be expected to involve changes of degree in us profound enough to\u000a      constitute changes of kind. He\u000a      considers ways in which the assumptions that we make about these matters\u000a      shape the decisions\u000a      that we make, both in our personal lives and in public policy, and he\u000a      highlights the very unfortunate\u000a      consequences that sometimes accrue.\u000a    Professor Bostrom and Dr Milan &#262;irkovi&#263; are also joint editors of the\u000a      2008 collection Global\u000a        Catastrophic Risks, to which they contribute an introduction. This\u000a      collection explores a wide range\u000a      of existential risks currently facing us, including those associated with\u000a      natural catastrophes, nuclear\u000a      war, the use of biological weapons, terrorism, global warming, advanced\u000a      nanotechnology, artificial\u000a      intelligence, and social collapse.\u000a    Professor Bostrom has been Director of the Future of Humanity Institute\u000a      and of the Programme on\u000a      the Impacts of Future Technology since their inception as part of the\u000a      Oxford Martin School in 2005,\u000a      having for the two previous years been a postdoctoral research fellow in\u000a      the Faculty of Philosophy.\u000a      Milan &#262;irkovi&#263; has been a Research Associate at the Future of Humanity\u000a      Institute since 2008.\u000a      Anders Sandberg has been a James Martin Research Fellow at the Future of\u000a      Humanities Institute\u000a      and the Programme on the Impacts of Future Technology since 2005.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11832","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Lowe has a well-established reputation in the applied ontology community,\u000a      owing to his wide-ranging work in the `commonsense' tradition in\u000a      metaphysics. His research on the four-category\u000a      ontology is promoted by several world-leading figures in applied ontology.\u000a      The four-category\u000a      ontology is especially attractive to information systems designers for two\u000a      main reasons. First it\u000a      renders explicit &#8212; while also refining and formalising &#8212; our intuitive\u000a      classificatory distinctions,\u000a      making it a `human-friendly' formal system, which enables human users to\u000a      cope more easily and\u000a      effectively with the human\/machine interface in complex information\u000a      processing tasks. This quality\u000a      is vital for modern information systems, which include vast amounts of\u000a      information, of many\u000a      different kinds, from a great diversity of sources. Second, it is a\u000a      `top-level' and `domain-neutral'\u000a      ontology, which gives it enormous scope. (It is `top-level' in that it\u000a      focuses on the most general and\u000a      basic ontological categories, to one or other of which all entities\u000a      belong; it is `domain-neutral' in that\u000a      it can be applied in any field of inquiry.) Many existing information\u000a      systems utilise only lower-level\u000a      and domain-specific ontologies, encompassing only entities involved in a\u000a      relatively limited range of\u000a      data (for example, biochemical or neurological data). However, with the\u000a      information-processing\u000a      power of modern computers increasing exponentially, with a corresponding\u000a      increase in the quantity\u000a      and complexity of information, there is a growing desire and need to\u000a      systematise and collate\u000a      information across many different domains. This demands a `top-level' and\u000a      `domain-neutral'\u000a      ontology which can, in principle, accommodate any sort of entity whatever,\u000a      thereby providing a\u000a      framework for organising information from any possible source and domain.\u000a    Lowe's four-category ontology has fulfilled these requirements, providing\u000a      a robust ontology that\u000a      can classify information from all domains and sources according to\u000a      principles which are cognitively\u000a      intuitive and human-friendly. As a result, his research has had a\u000a      significant influence upon a\u000a      diverse range of applied ontologists and information systems designers.\u000a      Because of this, Lowe\u000a      was invited to present the opening keynote address at a premier conference\u000a      in the field, the\u000a      International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS)\u000a      in Ogunquit, Maine,\u000a      2001. Subsequent interaction between Lowe and applied ontologists\u000a      culminated in a two-day\u000a      workshop in May 2013, which focused on `Information Systems and the\u000a      Four-Category Ontology'.\u000a      Lowe has thus been in direct dialogue with world-leading applied\u000a      ontologists representing the three\u000a      main international centres for applied ontology: the Director of the\u000a      National Center for Ontological\u000a      Research (NCOR, Buffalo, New York), the Director of the Laboratory for\u000a      Applied Ontology (LAO,\u000a      Trento, Italy), and a leading researcher at the Institute for Formal\u000a      Ontology and Medical\u000a      Information Science (IFOMIS, Saarland University, Germany). All three were\u000a      present at the 2013\u000a      workshop, where Lowe presented recent developments in the four-category\u000a      ontology and\u000a      discussed potential practical applications to the current projects at\u000a      NCOR, LAO, and IFOMIS.\u000a    The research has proved indispensable to the applied ontology community\u000a      in two principal\u000a      ways:\u000a    (i) Development of Ontologies:\u000a    The four-category ontology has been fundamental to the work of the most\u000a      influential applied\u000a      ontologists. It is extensively cited in the biannual proceedings of the\u000a      Formal Ontology in Information\u000a      Systems conference (2004, 2006, 2010) and in all of the major articles by\u000a      the NCOR and LAO\u000a      directors, themselves amongst the most cited figures in applied ontology\u000a      and information systems\u000a      theory (with over 30,000 citations between them). The applied ontology and\u000a      information systems\u000a      community spans not only academic but also important industrial,\u000a      commercial, medical and\u000a      governmental organisations, and influences the design and\/or use of\u000a      information systems in a very\u000a      diverse range of contexts. For instance, non-academic partners of the main\u000a      centres at NCOR,\u000a      LAO, and IFOMIS include IBM, the US National Institute of Standards and\u000a      Technology, and the US\u000a      Department of Defense. Without Lowe's research, key developments in\u000a      applied ontology would not\u000a      have happened, developments that have been put into practice in both\u000a      academic and non-academic contexts. The NCOR director writes of Lowe's\u000a      `foundational role' in describing the `basic\u000a      ontological categories' upon which the NCOR relies, while the LAO director\u000a      explains that it was\u000a      through studying Lowe's work that he `realised that formal ontology can\u000a      capture the fundamental\u000a      categories and relations' needed for the design of effective information\u000a      systems. A researcher at\u000a      IFOMIS describes Lowe as `one of the analytical philosophers who have had\u000a      the greatest impact\u000a      on applied ontology research and development,' and comments that\u000a      `Professor Lowe's work on\u000a      ontology has been and still is indispensable for establishing applied\u000a      ontology as a field of its own in\u000a      the area of computing science in general and of information systems in\u000a      particular.'\u000a    To be more specific, Lowe's four-category ontology has contributed\u000a      fundamentally and\u000a      directly to the development of two of the most important formal ontologies\u000a      currently used in\u000a      information systems theory &#8212; namely, Domain Ontology for Linguistic and\u000a      Cognitive Engineering\u000a      (DOLCE), developed by researchers at the LAO, and Basic Formal Ontology\u000a      (BFO), developed by\u000a      the research groups at IFOMIS and, later, NCOR, which hosted a 2006\u000a      conference in Lowe's\u000a      honour, at which he gave the keynote address. Hence the principal\u000a      beneficiaries of this research\u000a      are the developers and users of these ontologies.\u000a    DOLCE and BFO were both launched in 2002 and have been continually used\u000a      and updated\u000a      ever since &#8212; for instance, BFO version 2 was launched in July 2012 &#8212; and\u000a      provide domain\u000a      ontologies that enable information retrieval, analysis, and integration in\u000a      scientific, medical, and\u000a      other domains. Those two ontologies between them form the basis of over\u000a      one hundred applied\u000a      projects in areas ranging from biomedical classification, cancer research,\u000a      pharmacology, earth\u000a      sciences, epidemiology and workflow management systems, all of which\u000a      require DOLCE and BFO\u000a      to organise and process vast amounts of data from diverse sources and\u000a      formalise it in human-friendly information systems. A total of 67 major\u000a      organisations are listed on the DOLCE and BFO\u000a      websites as users of these ontologies. They include AstraZeneca, IBM, the\u000a      UN Food and\u000a      Agriculture Organisation, the Bulgarian Academy of Science, and the New\u000a      York State Center of\u000a      Excellence in Bioinformatics &amp; Life Sciences.\u000a    Furthermore, Lowe's metaphysics is also playing a central role in the\u000a      development of particular\u000a      domain ontologies, of which two examples are given here. (i) Biomedical\u000a      ontologies that build upon\u000a      BFO have been influenced not just by Lowe's four-category ontology, but\u000a      also by his closely\u000a      connected work on individuation, identity, dispositions and tendencies.\u000a      These ontologies are of\u000a      special interest to biologists and epidemiologists, for instance when\u000a      attempting to model the spread\u000a      of infectious diseases. A leading biomedical ontologist describes Lowe as\u000a      `one of my main points\u000a      of reference' and confirms that that his research is `very much esteemed\u000a      in the bio-ontological\u000a      community'. In particular, Lowe's account of probabilistic dispositions\u000a      (roughly, `tendencies') has\u000a      initiated new avenues of research into biomedical ontology, especially in\u000a      relation to the\u000a      development of disease ontologies. (ii) Lowe's work is also applied in the\u000a      Library of Congress\u000a      Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) Ontology, which\u000a      is a general\u000a      conceptual model for bibliographic records (and relationships between\u000a      them), developed by the\u000a      International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions. The\u000a      model is designed to govern\u000a      the development of cataloguing rules within particular systems.\u000a    (ii) Education and training:\u000a    Lowe's research also has a wider influence on the fields of applied\u000a      ontology and information-systems design, by featuring prominently in\u000a      educational documents and training courses. His\u000a      distinctive conception of metaphysics and ontology is adopted by leading\u000a      state-of-the-art texts in\u000a      applied ontology, such as the IFOMIS training document `Ontology for the\u000a      Twenty First Century: An\u000a      Introduction with Recommendations' (a freely-available key training\u000a      resource for the applied\u000a      ontology community, hosted by organisations including the Neuroinformatics\u000a      Center at the\u000a      University of Oregon and the School of Information Science at the Federal\u000a      University of Minas\u000a      Gerais, Brazil) and Katherine Munn and Barry Smith's Applied Ontology:\u000a        An Introduction. Both of\u000a      these explicitly acknowledge the fundamental influence of Lowe's work upon\u000a      applied ontology and\u000a      information systems; for instance, the former lists Lowe alongside\u000a      Aristotle, Kant, and Quine as a\u000a      major figure in the history of ontology, while the latter describes him as\u000a      `one of the most important\u000a      contemporary representatives' of categorial ontology that is of special\u000a      value to the applied ontology\u000a      community.

Lowe at Durham University.\u000a      An ontology is a\u000a      system of categories, which identifies the kinds of beings that can exist\u000a      and co-exist, along with\u000a      their interrelations. Lowe argues in favour of a four-category ontology.\u000a      This was first set out in his\u000a      1998 book The Possibility of Metaphysics, and further developed in\u000a      a succession of other books\u000a      and articles. The four-category ontology assigns all actual and possible\u000a      entities to one of four\u000a      fundamental ontological categories: object (or individual\u000a        substance), kind, attribute, and mode (or\u000a      individual accident). Lowe argues that the four-category ontology\u000a      possesses a classificatory and\u000a      explanatory power unrivalled by more ontologically parsimonious systems\u000a      employing fewer or no\u000a      categories. He demonstrates this by providing a unified account of\u000a      identity and individuation,\u000a      causation, dispositions and tendencies, natural laws, necessity and\u000a      possibility, and truth-making\u000a      (that is, how true propositions are `ontologically grounded' by entities\u000a      whose existence explains\u000a      their truth).\u000a    The four-category ontology is distinctive in mirroring the natural or\u000a      intuitive classificatory practices\u000a      of human beings and belongs to a `common-sense' tradition in metaphysics\u000a      that can be traced\u000a      back to Aristotle. Furthermore, it also reflects the syntactic structures\u000a      of natural language much\u000a      more closely than do its chief rivals, giving it greater human\u000a      user-friendliness. It consequently\u000a      possesses an intelligibility and robustness that many other current\u000a      ontologies of philosophical\u000a      origin do not. Lowe has further developed these claims concerning human\u000a      cognition, natural\u000a      language, and the four-category ontology in his two most recent books, Forms\u000a        of Thought and\u000a      More Kinds of Being.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11833","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Dissemination and Overall Impact:\u000d\u000a    The research was originally disseminated through two monographs, eight\u000d\u000a      journal articles and, more widely, through Hamilton's reviews and articles\u000d\u000a      in jazz and classical music journals, and his public presentations. One\u000d\u000a      monograph is used as a teaching resource for musicians, the other is\u000d\u000a      widely read by non-academic musical practitioners. Published research\u000d\u000a      generated further correspondence with musicians, which then led to\u000d\u000a      speaking invitations and public engagement activities. These include\u000d\u000a      invited keynote addresses on the aesthetics of imperfection to non-\u000d\u000a      academic events at Kunstuniversit&#228;t Graz, Royal Northern College of Music,\u000d\u000a      UK Centre for Contemporary Music Practice, Music Faculty Brunel University\u000d\u000a      (all 2012), WDR jazz project, Cologne (Munster Jazz Workshop, 2011), New\u000d\u000a      York Jazz Journalism Conference, Columbia University (2007), and\u000d\u000a      Grahamstown Arts Festival (South Africa, 2007). Hamilton is engaged in\u000d\u000a      regular correspondence with several leading contemporary musicians. He has\u000d\u000a      discussed the aesthetics of imperfection in radio interviews for\u000d\u000a      Australian Broadcasting Corporation, San Francisco Jazz station KCSM Jazz\u000d\u000a      91, JAZZ 91.7 San Antonio, Radio Tees, Estonian Radio, Radio Corse and\u000d\u000a      others.\u000d\u000a    The level of interaction with relevant professionals has grown and\u000d\u000a      diversified over a period of several years. As a result of this\u000d\u000a      interaction, the research has also influenced teaching and training\u000d\u000a      courses. A master class at the Siena Jazz Festival (July 2008) was\u000d\u000a      attended by around eighty musicians, and a series of classes at Hong Kong\u000d\u000a      University Music Department (March\/April 2013), were attended by young\u000d\u000a      composers and musicians from East Asia, Europe and the USA. Hamilton's\u000d\u000a      work forms the basis of the `Philosophy of Music' course at Massachusetts\u000d\u000a      College of Liberal Arts, `Aesthetics of Music' course at Brunel\u000d\u000a      University, `Sound Cultures' course at the RMIT School of Art (Australia),\u000d\u000a      and other courses elsewhere. Hence impact has occurred not only through\u000d\u000a      Hamilton's direct engagement with musicians and other relevant\u000d\u000a      professionals, but also through its subsequent inclusion in teaching and\u000d\u000a      training courses.\u000d\u000a    Most recently, a cross-disciplinary workshop on Aesthetics of\u000d\u000a      Imperfection at Durham in May 2013 involved musicians, critics and\u000d\u000a      artists. Contributors addressed issues and arguments in Hamilton's seminal\u000d\u000a      British Journal of Aesthetics article (2000). A leading American\u000d\u000a      jazz critic and historian commented on the event that \"this type of\u000d\u000a      meeting-of-minds is as invaluable as it is rare. The workshop was a unique\u000d\u000a      event in my experience. It will have an impact on my work in showing how\u000d\u000a      dialogue between musicians, composers, visual artists and philosophers can\u000d\u000a      develop a deeper aesthetics of spontaneous musical performance, which will\u000d\u000a      inform my music criticism and historical writing &#8212; challenging me to\u000d\u000a      question conventional dichotomies of improvisation and composition\". An\u000d\u000a      Italian critic commented that \"Accepting imperfection...opens a different\u000d\u000a      way of thinking about performance and recording of music, but also about\u000d\u000a      other artistic expressions and methods of teaching...I came back with my\u000d\u000a      views enriched and changed\". And a leading Italian jazz pianist commented\u000d\u000a      that \"my mind was strongly stimulated to think about\u000d\u000a      perfection\/imperfection as a dyad\".\u000d\u000a    As a result of all this, the research has contributed to musical practice\u000d\u000a      by providing an original account of the nature of improvisation, and the\u000d\u000a      interpretation of composed works, that (1) clarifies the music performance\u000d\u000a      practices, especially those of improvised music, (2) affirms similarities\u000d\u000a      as well as contrasts between improvised and composed music, and (3)\u000d\u000a      affirms improvisation's distinctive nature, revealing practical and\u000d\u000a      aesthetic complexities obscured by the prioritising of composed music.\u000d\u000a      Increased self-consciousness in interpreting practice helps musicians\u000d\u000a      improvise with greater spontaneity and artistic depth. Principal users\u000d\u000a      are: (a) established musicians; (b) young musicians who are in training;\u000d\u000a      (c) music critics and commentators; and (d) other artists. The impact on\u000d\u000a      these users can be analysed as follows:\u000d\u000a    (a) Impact on established musicians:\u000d\u000a      The aesthetics of imperfection has provided accomplished and leading\u000d\u000a      musicians with a fertile new understanding of the distinctive nature of\u000d\u000a      improvisation and interpretation. One San Francisco-based jazz pianist\u000d\u000a      writes that Hamilton's work has \"tremendously enhanced my life as a\u000d\u000a      creative musician\". He observes that \"Andy's ideas that improvised music\u000d\u000a      adheres to an aesthetics of imperfection that is distinct from the\u000d\u000a      aesthetic values we associate with composed mediums has influenced me a\u000d\u000a      great deal...When you realise that the standards of logic and balance that\u000d\u000a      one expects from an edited composition are different from those of an\u000d\u000a      improvised musical event, it affects the way you approach practising. For\u000d\u000a      instance, practising being aware in the moment with its rhythmic and\u000d\u000a      melodic possibilities (or sources) takes precedence rather than over\u000d\u000a      polishing a melodic phrase.\" An eminent Australian improviser and composer\u000d\u000a      credits Hamilton's work with being an \"important part of a small\u000d\u000a      revolution\" in his music, as it dissolves misunderstandings surrounding\u000d\u000a      improvised performance versus composition: \"His writings have helped to\u000d\u000a      give me an historical perspective of my own musical endeavours. They have\u000d\u000a      helped to provide me with a framework with which to assess the relevance\u000d\u000a      and `positioning' of my work artistically, enabling me to think more\u000d\u000a      clearly about what I am hoping to achieve as a musician and composer.\"\u000d\u000a      Citing Hamilton's article `Rhythm and Stasis' (2011), which argues that\u000d\u000a      rhythm cannot be characterised simply in terms of duration, another\u000d\u000a      musician has been drawn to working with extended duration &#8212; a longer\u000d\u000a      time-scale of musical events &#8212; on his album on the Alt Vinyl label.\u000d\u000a    (b) Training young musicians:\u000d\u000a      The research has inspired young musicians to transcend more mechanistic,\u000d\u000a      unspontaneous approaches in favour of greater creativity. For one\u000d\u000a      Melbourne-based sound-artist and teacher who incorporates Hamilton's work\u000d\u000a      into two of his courses, it \"provides a unique viewpoint founded on a long\u000d\u000a      and deep engagement\" with the audio arts, pedagogically valuable because\u000d\u000a      it is \"directed towards themes and ideas [like improvisation] that are\u000d\u000a      usually overlooked or little discussed\" but are of central importance to\u000d\u000a      training musicians.\u000d\u000a    (c) Music reviewers and commentators:\u000d\u000a      Hamilton is widely credited &#8212; in such journals as The Wire and Current\u000a        Musicology &#8212; with an innovative approach to musical biography,\u000d\u000a      exemplified in his book on Lee Konitz. Here, philosophical\u000d\u000a      aesthetics informs a style of interviewing which articulates tacit\u000d\u000a      insights and ideas of musicians in a way that traditional biography cannot\u000d\u000a      achieve. It \"rethinks many of the conventions of the ubiquitous jazz\u000d\u000a      biography\" and offers a \"model for future writers\" (Brian Kane, Current\u000a        Musicology, 2008); for one eminent Miles Davis sideman it represents\u000d\u000a      an \"extraordinary approach to a biography\" and is \"the definition of a\u000d\u000a      living history\". The research has thus (1) demonstrated how\u000d\u000a      philosophically informed musical biography can capture practicing\u000d\u000a      musicians' insights into improvisation (and other musical practices) and\u000d\u000a      (2) provided a model for future biographers who draw on the testimonies of\u000d\u000a      musicians &#8212; hence one leading contemporary music magazine's suggestion\u000d\u000a      that Hamilton's research \"may well mark the inception of a format new to\u000d\u000a      writing on Western music\" (The Wire).\u000d\u000a    (d) Other artists:\u000d\u000a      The aesthetics of improvisation is enjoying widening influence on other\u000d\u000a      artists who use improvisational techniques. One UK-based photographer\u000d\u000a      elucidates the impact of the imperfection- perfection dichotomy: \"[Instead\u000d\u000a      of trying] on every occasion to make a `perfect' image in the camera, i.e.\u000d\u000a      exercise full control over the aperture, speed and framing of the image at\u000d\u000a      the `decisive moment' [with] little work in post-production...I would work\u000d\u000a      more spontaneously... in a less pre- conceived way, to pay less heed to\u000d\u000a      technical issues....instead of always striving to obtain maximum depth of\u000d\u000a      field when working close up...I began to experiment with random selections\u000d\u000a      of speed and aperture, focus and framing...There are fewer successes [but]\u000d\u000a      Andy has opened me up to new possibilities\". And, concerning Hamilton's\u000d\u000a      application of the aesthetics of imperfection to recording, one\u000d\u000a      London-based recording engineer states that \"although the idea of `pure'\u000d\u000a      or `authentic' recordings persists...through considering Andy's work I\u000d\u000a      have become aware that such conceptions of fidelity and authenticity are\u000d\u000a      questionable, irrespective of genre. I find this a liberating challenge.\"\u000d\u000a      Hamilton's research on improvisation has therefore had significant impact\u000d\u000a      on artistic practice beyond music.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The research by Professor Andy Hamilton (appointed at Durham in 1993) on\u000d\u000a      the `aesthetics of imperfection' has had three types of impact:\u000d\u000a    (1) Transforming the practice, teaching, and training of jazz musicians\u000d\u000a      by providing a novel aesthetic basis for creating and understanding both\u000d\u000a      improvised music, and the performance of composed music.\u000d\u000a    (2) Influencing other artists in the improvised and performing arts,\u000d\u000a      including sound artists, photographers and recording engineers.\u000d\u000a    (3) Providing music critics and writers with an innovative style of\u000d\u000a      interviewing, with broad appeal beyond an academic readership, designed to\u000d\u000a      identify and articulate otherwise tacit musical insights for the benefit\u000d\u000a      of other composers and performers.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Durham University\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Durham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Durham","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"North East","UKPRN":10007143}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"7521315","Name":"Munster"},{"GeoNamesId":"2778067","Name":"Graz"},{"GeoNamesId":"5391959","Name":"San Francisco"},{"GeoNamesId":"6254926","Name":"Massachusetts"},{"GeoNamesId":"4726206","Name":"San Antonio"},{"GeoNamesId":"1819729","Name":"Hong Kong"},{"GeoNamesId":"1000501","Name":"Grahamstown"},{"GeoNamesId":"2886242","Name":"Köln"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Outputs: Publications on the aesthetics of improvisation include:\u000d\u000a    \u000a&#8226; Hamilton, A. 2011. `Rhythm and Stasis: A Major and Almost Entirely\u000d\u000a      Neglected Philosophical Problem', Proceedings of the Aristotelian\u000d\u000a        Society, 111 (1): 25-42.\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000a&#8226; Hamilton, A. 2010. `Jazz as Classical Music', in M.

Hamilton defined\u000d\u000a      and defended an `aesthetics of imperfection' that values spontaneous\u000d\u000a      process over finished product, and which is expressed most clearly in the\u000d\u000a      work of improvising musicians. Furthermore, this ideal of spontaneous\u000d\u000a      creation also applies to the interpretation of composed music, which is\u000d\u000a      typically not mechanically reproduced, but creatively interpreted; here,\u000d\u000a      spontaneity at the micro-level, while still following a score, can create\u000d\u000a      a higher level of creative performance. An aesthetics of imperfection\u000d\u000a      therefore provides a theoretical framework that contrasts with traditional\u000d\u000a      \"perfectionist\" attitudes across the range of performance practice, and\u000d\u000a      deepens musicians' capacity to understand and appreciate both improvised\u000d\u000a      and composed music.\u000d\u000a    Hamilton argued that this distinctive aesthetic of spontaneous\u000d\u000a      performance could be found in the testimonies of musicians &#8212; initially,\u000d\u000a      jazz and improvising musicians, but also interpreters and composers &#8212; and\u000d\u000a      that an aesthetics of imperfection affords the resources to articulate and\u000d\u000a      understand those musicians' tacit insights. His 2007 book Lee Konitz:\u000d\u000a        Conversations on the Improviser's Art developed the aesthetics of\u000d\u000a      imperfection through its sustained dialogue with a leading contemporary\u000d\u000a      jazz musician and with other musicians he has worked with. Using his\u000d\u000a      aesthetics of imperfection, Hamilton was able to articulate\u000d\u000a      previously-neglected insights that subtly inform practices of\u000d\u000a      improvisation within jazz, correcting longstanding misunderstandings\u000d\u000a      concerning the significance of improvisation within contemporary music,\u000d\u000a      and more widely about its status as a skilful and teachable musical\u000d\u000a      practice.\u000d\u000a    For Hamilton, an aesthetics of imperfection addresses related problems:\u000d\u000a      (1) improvised music is often assessed using standards derived from\u000d\u000a      composed music, diminishing its perceived status and affecting the ability\u000d\u000a      to listen to it appreciatively; (2) its distinctive aims of spontaneous\u000d\u000a      creation are misunderstood by listeners, critics, teachers and even\u000d\u000a      musicians themselves; (3) its distinctive model of preparation and study\u000d\u000a      is also poorly understood &#8212; for example, one conventional model of\u000d\u000a      preparation involves rehearsal of patterns to be repeated in live\u000d\u000a      performance. Hamilton's model helps musicians to improvise at the highest\u000d\u000a      level, showing how they can prepare for spontaneous creation in the\u000d\u000a      moment, in interaction with others from whom they draw material &#8212; how they\u000d\u000a      can `prepare for the spontaneous effort'. Although the aesthetics of\u000d\u000a      imperfection is reflected in the reports of some improvisers, before\u000d\u000a      Hamilton's work it had been neglected by philosophers and musicologists,\u000d\u000a      and Hamilton's work shows how philosophical aesthetics offers rich\u000d\u000a      resources for its articulation. It should be stressed that the research on\u000d\u000a      the aesthetics of imperfection concerns musical performance of all kinds\u000d\u000a      owing to its implications for our understanding of interpretation and\u000d\u000a      performance of composed music &#8212; indeed, jazz emphasises the\u000d\u000a      interpenetration of composition and improvisation. The aesthetic can,\u000d\u000a      moreover, be extended to all performing, and indeed non-performing arts, a\u000d\u000a      process that is under development.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11834","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact has arisen progressively over several years, through\u000a      increasing interaction and\u000a      collaboration with beneficiaries. Principal beneficiaries are (1)\u000a      clinicians (mostly psychiatrists,\u000a      clinical psychologists and psychotherapists); (2) the mental health\u000a      charity SANE; and (3) mental\u000a      health service users.\u000a    Clinicians: Since 2005, Ratcliffe's published research has\u000a      received increasing attention from\u000a      clinicians, which has led to correspondence, speaking invitations and\u000a      several collaborations. These\u000a      have shaped the direction of the research, generating additional\u000a      publications and further\u000a      interactions with clinicians. At a 2005 conference (`Phenomenology and\u000a      Psychiatry for the 21st\u000a      Century', Maudsley Hospital, London), Ratcliffe introduced the concept of\u000a      `existential feeling' to an\u000a      audience of approximately 300 psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and\u000a      others. He has since given\u000a      over 40 conference or seminar presentations on existential feeling in 10\u000a      countries, most of which\u000a      involved clinicians. For example, his 2011 lecture at the Tavistock\u000a      Clinic, London, was attended by\u000a      over 100 people, mostly clinicians. Two AHRC projects associated with the\u000a      research involved\u000a      eleven conferences or workshops. Speakers included sixteen prominent\u000a      psychiatrists and clinical\u000a      psychologists, most of whom participated in more than one event.\u000a    The resulting impact consists in a better understanding of experiences\u000a      that are central to many\u000a      forms of psychiatric illness but generally neglected or misunderstood.\u000a      This improved understanding\u000a      has led to changes in practice. Research findings have assisted clinicians\u000a      by (a) challenging the\u000a      view that certain phenomena are to be understood in terms of localised\u000a      perceptual experiences\u000a      and \/ or beliefs, (b) analysing an aspect of experience that many\u000a      clinicians recognise but struggle\u000a      to describe and explain, and (c) clarifying the similarities and\u000a      differences between certain forms of\u000a      experience that occur in psychiatric illness. Prominent psychiatrists,\u000a      psychologists and therapists in\u000a      several countries have described how the research has enriched their\u000a      thinking, informed their\u000a      interactions with patients and been integrated into clinical training. For\u000a      example, the research has\u000a      influenced the practice of the Consultant Forensic Psychotherapist at\u000a      Broadmoor High Security\u000a      Psychiatric Hospital, UK. She frequently encounters kinds of experience\u000a      that are very difficult to\u000a      understand, which reflect the distinctive predicaments of patients with\u000a      psychiatric illness diagnoses\u000a      who also face the prospect of indefinite detention. The relationship\u000a      between her practice and\u000a      Ratcliffe's research was explored through correspondence between them,\u000a      which followed one of\u000a      his conference presentations. This culminated in a workshop on `Ways of\u000a      Being in Time' (Durham,\u000a      July 2013), which they organised together. The impact of such interactions\u000a      upon practice consists\u000a      in a more refined ability to interpret distress, which contributes to\u000a      therapeutic response. In her\u000a      words, the research \"helps clinicians like me reassess the lived\u000a      experience of time in\u000a      circumstances that are associated with high rates of depression and\u000a      suicidality [...] The particularly\u000a      important impact of this is that it helps clinicians maintain a more human\u000a      and humane approach to\u000a      care of those who are detained for years at a time; and helps develop the\u000a      compassionate stance\u000a      [...] This work deepens my clinical relationships with patients so we can\u000a      provide better care\".\u000a    Given the research's potential to enhance empathetic understanding and\u000a      thus shape clinician-\u000a      patient interaction, it is widely used in clinical teaching and training.\u000a      For instance, a senior clinician\u000a      at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, USA, uses\u000a      the research in clinical\u000a      training as well as in his own practice. He reports that it \"enhances\u000a      therapists' capacities to\u000a      understand psychological phenomena and be with clients\". Hence it is used\u000a      in \"professional\u000a      development seminars, training both interns and experienced clinicians\".\u000a      He adds that the research\u000a      has had a \"significant impact\" upon his own practice, \"enhancing\" the\u000a      \"ability to be empathetically\u000a      attuned with clients and facilitate their capacity for change\". At Mount\u000a      Holyoke College, also in\u000a      Massachusetts, a Professor of Psychology has similarly reported that the\u000a      research is having a\u000a      \"significant impact on the training of psychology students [...]\u000a      especially those likely to practice as\u000a      clinicians\"; it has \"enabled them to understand the complexities of\u000a      depression far more deeply than\u000a      [they] otherwise could have done\". The research also features heavily in\u000a      doctoral programmes in\u000a      clinical psychology and social work at Rutgers University, USA, aimed at\u000a      clinicians and senior mid-\u000a      career social workers. Because of this, Ratcliffe was invited to teach\u000a      three modules at Rutgers to\u000a      approximately thirty students taking the social work course, and he did so\u000a      in April 2013. In follow-\u000a      up exercises, students were instructed by the course leaders to\u000a      reinterpret clinical cases in the light\u000a      of Ratcliffe's findings. In Colombia, the research has been disseminated\u000a      through the Colombian\u000a      Association of Psychiatry, influencing clinical practice and training. For\u000a      instance, a psychiatrist\u000a      based at Universidad del Rosario, Bogota, uses \"the concept of existential\u000a      feeling in case studies\"\u000a      in order to train \"residents of psychiatry\". In the UK too, the research\u000a      has, to quote a prominent\u000a      psychiatrist, \"provided valuable training resources for clinicians\". He\u000a      uses it on clinical training\u000a      schemes in London and the West Midlands, as it allows trainees \"to\u000a      appreciate the pervasive and\u000a      diffuse nature of moods that chimes with the experiences patients relate\u000a      to us\" and to realize that\u000a      \"subjectivity and meaning remain important and crucial to clinical work\".\u000a    SANE: Due to interest generated by the AHRC and DFG-funded project\u000a      on depression, in 2008\u000a      Ratcliffe was approached for advice by the mental health charity SANE.\u000a      This led to a continuing\u000a      collaboration with SANE, and Ratcliffe is now a research advisor for the\u000a      charity. Central to SANE's\u000a      work is the provision of support for people suffering from psychiatric\u000a      illness, largely through\u000a      empathetic listening. `Front-line' staff members, consisting of\u000a      approximately 140 trained volunteers,\u000a      perform this role through a helpline, email and an on-line support forum.\u000a      Ratcliffe's publications on\u000a      existential feeling serve as an interpretative framework to help\u000a      articulate otherwise elusive aspects\u000a      of experience that are central to many service users' distress. This has\u000a      contributed to the research\u000a      of SANE's psychosocial research team on suicide, which itself feeds into\u000a      the practice of front-line\u000a      staff by facilitating greater understanding of service users' experiences\u000a      and thus better support for\u000a      them. Members of the SANE research team have benefited from their\u000a      attendance of four\u000a      AHRC\/DFG project conferences in the UK and Germany. Also central to the\u000a      collaboration were\u000a      three 2012 meetings involving Ratcliffe, staff from the Durham Philosophy\u000a      Department and Centre\u000a      for Medical Humanities, and employees of the charity. During the first two\u000a      meetings, the Durham\u000a      group gave the SANE research team a substantial body of first-person\u000a      testimony on experiences of\u000a      depression (145 detailed questionnaire responses), and discussed its\u000a      potential implications for the\u000a      practice of the charity's front-line staff. The third meeting was a focus\u000a      group that included the\u000a      charity's research team, Head of Services and several front-line staff. In\u000a      addition to this, the\u000a      conception of clinical empathy that Ratcliffe's research embodies is now\u000a      helping the psychosocial\u000a      research team to provide an interpretation of the \"SANE ethos\" that\u000a      underlies service delivery.\u000a      Under the direction of the Head of Services, this is being used to assist\u000a      with fundraising, develop\u000a      training for volunteers, and rewrite some of the \"Services\" section on the\u000a      charity's website.\u000a    The research has therefore assisted the charity by (1) providing\u000a      direction and support for the\u000a      SANE research team, which in turn feeds into practice (e.g. by\u000a      disseminating their research to\u000a      colleagues, producing leaflets, and through formal and informal\u000a      conversations), (2) engaging\u000a      directly with some of SANE's front-line staff so as to enhance their\u000a      understanding of service users'\u000a      experiences, (3) strengthening links between the charity's research and\u000a      practice, and (4) helping to\u000a      articulate the charity's aims.\u000a    Service Users: Many of Ratcliffe's presentations on existential\u000a      feeling and\/or depression have\u000a      been attended by mental health service users, and by others who have been\u000a      directly or indirectly\u000a      affected by psychiatric illness. His published research is also read by\u000a      service users, and this has\u000a      led to sustained correspondence in some cases. Ratcliffe has received\u000a      several unsolicited\u000a      communications from people with psychiatric diagnoses, stating that the\u000a      research serves to aid\u000a      both self-understanding and the ability to communicate psychiatric\u000a      distress. Some respondents to\u000a      the depression questionnaire study also commented on the helpfulness of\u000a      the research,\u000a      expressing relief that somebody was acknowledging the aspects of\u000a      experience they found most\u000a      troubling. This kind of impact is exemplified by the effect of the\u000a      research upon a well-known\u000a      service-user, who has published accounts of his experiences and also\u000a      produces a journal. He\u000a      informed Ratcliffe that \"Feelings of Being was an important book\u000a      for me to read as it validated my\u000a      lifelong struggle with derealization. I became aware that I had been\u000a      indeed laboring under a severe\u000a      handicap, which no one else had articulated. I shared the ideas of the\u000a      book with other long time\u000a      activists in National Alliance on Mental Illness\". Because of the\u000a      research's significance for those\u000a      who are directly or indirectly affected by psychiatric illness, Ratcliffe\u000a      was invited to give the keynote\u000a      lecture at the June 2013 NHS conference `Survivors of Bereavement by\u000a      Suicide'. The event was\u000a      attended by over 100 people, including bereaved relatives, mental health\u000a      service users and\u000a      healthcare professionals. Its principal aim was to raise awareness of\u000a      depression and suicide, and\u000a      facilitate understanding. Ratcliffe's presentation, `The World of\u000a      Depression' (an electronic version\u000a      of which was also made available to participants after the event) played a\u000a      central role in realising\u000a      this aim. It had a direct impact upon those who were present, by informing\u000a      their thinking about\u000a      psychiatric illness and their various responses to it. The organisers\u000a      reported a \"huge amount of\u000a      positive feedback from delegates, who gained a tremendous amount\" from the\u000a      presentation and\u000a      subsequent discussions, which they found \"fascinating and thought\u000a      provoking\".\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study details the impact of Professor Matthew Ratcliffe's\u000a      research on existential feeling\u000a      in psychiatric illness.

Instead,\u000a      Ratcliffe notes, people speak of `feelings' of unreality, heightened\u000a      reality, strangeness,\u000a      unfamiliarity, existence, isolation, oneness with things, and so on. He\u000a      maintains that such feelings\u000a      are distinctive in virtue of two characteristics. First, they amount to an\u000a      all-enveloping way of `finding\u000a      oneself in a world', rather than a more specifically focused experience or\u000a      judgment. Second, they\u000a      are `feelings', in the sense that they cannot be extricated from bodily\u000a      awareness. In his 2008 book,\u000a      Feelings of Being, Ratcliffe builds upon this characterisation and\u000a      offers a detailed analysis of\u000a      existential feeling, which provides a means to convey, distinguish and\u000a      further investigate a range of\u000a      elusive but profound experiential disturbances that are central to many\u000a      kinds of psychiatric illness.\u000a      Since then, he has further developed the analysis in 25 articles and book\u000a      chapters. In the process,\u000a      he has reconceptualised various phenomena that are usually construed in\u000a      terms of less\u000a      encompassing changes in perception and\/or belief, and also challenged\u000a      tendencies to separate\u000a      cognition from affect.\u000a    Since 2008, the research has focused upon the role of existential feeling\u000a      in experiences of\u000a      depression. According to the World Health Organisation, depression will be\u000a      the world's leading\u000a      cause of disability by 2020, with enormous personal, social and economic\u000a      costs. However,\u000a      psychiatrists and others have undertaken surprisingly little research on\u000a      what it is like to be\u000a      depressed, even though (a) most of the established diagnostic criteria for\u000a      depression are implicitly\u000a      or explicitly phenomenological, and (b) sufferers often complain that an\u000a      inability to convey the\u000a      experience to others adds to their suffering. Ratcliffe argues that the\u000a      elusiveness of the experience\u000a      is largely symptomatic of the fact that depression, in some cases at\u000a      least, involves a radical shift in\u000a      existential feeling &#8212; something that is seldom articulated or understood\u000a      in the course of everyday\u000a      life or, indeed, in psychiatry. Furthermore, labels such as `major\u000a      depression' fail to distinguish\u000a      importantly different forms of experience, adding to the problem.\u000a      Ratcliffe has published detailed\u000a      analyses of several aspects of depression, including despair, guilt,\u000a      altered temporal experience, a\u000a      sense of inability, belief that recovery is impossible, complaints of\u000a      `living in a different world', and\u000a      bodily symptoms. The research also involved a detailed,\u000a      philosophically-informed questionnaire\u000a      study on experiences of depression, which generated a substantial body of\u000a      first-person testimony\u000a      (see section 4).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12155","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Saul's work on this subject has reached large audiences due to the blog What\u000a        is it Like to be a Woman in Philosophy?

As part of Jennifer Saul's efforts to understand the causes of\u000d\u000a      this, she decided that she needed to learn more concerning the nature of\u000d\u000a      the issues that women face in the discipline. She therefore began\u000d\u000a      gathering stories of women philosophers' experiences at a blog, What\u000d\u000a        is it Like to be a Woman in Philosophy?: http:\/\/beingawomaninphilosophy.wordpress.com\/.\u000d\u000a      This blog was founded in October 2010, and receives up to 25,000 hits per\u000d\u000a      day. The stories gathered have helped to demonstrate vividly the\u000d\u000a      significance of the problem of sexual harassment for women in philosophy.\u000d\u000a      They have also shaped Saul's thinking on the subject and they play a key\u000d\u000a      role in the central argument of her paper [R1 below].\u000d\u000a    Since 2011 Saul has been working on a paper concerning sexual harassment\u000d\u000a      in philosophy, based on insights gained from running the blog, and it has\u000d\u000a      been presented in three different countries. It was first presented as a\u000d\u000a      paper in June 2012 in Valencia, and has also been presented as an invited\u000d\u000a      paper at Birkbeck, Reading and Oxford. It was presented in June 2013 at an\u000d\u000a      international conference on Diversity in Philosophy at the University of\u000d\u000a      Dayton, USA. From 2011 on, Saul discussed the arguments of the paper\u000d\u000a      widely with colleagues around the world. It has been accepted by the Journal\u000d\u000a        of Applied Philosophy.\u000d\u000a    This paper argues for two claims: (1) That those attempting to deal with\u000d\u000a      cases of sexual harassment in the real world have been excessively\u000d\u000a      focussed on formal claims procedures as a response; and (2) That\u000d\u000a      philosophers working on the topic of sexual harassment have been\u000d\u000a      excessively focussed on the definition of `sexual harassment'. This paper\u000d\u000a      also draws heavily on Christopher Bennett's work [R2 below] on informal\u000d\u000a      mechanisms for sanctioning wrongdoers. Bennett argues that `the withdrawal\u000d\u000a      of civility and solidarity' can be a powerful means by which a community\u000d\u000a      symbolises its attitude toward wrongdoers. This idea underpins the\u000d\u000a      informal approach that Saul argues has been wrongly neglected by those\u000d\u000a      seeking to deal with this problem, and thus Bennett's work has had an\u000d\u000a      indirect influence on the debate.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12156","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Saul's work on this subject has reached large audiences due to online\u000a      circulation of papers R1 and R2 above, and the Gendered Conference\u000a      Campaign online at Feminist Philosophers Blog (up to 20,000 hits\/day),\u000a      which has drawn heavily on Saul's research (see below). The BPA report\u000a      (item R3) has also been widely circulated to departments and related\u000a      bodies. As a result of this, Saul's work has brought about the following\u000a      significant changes:\u000a    1. Impact on the policies of departments (a few examples, others are\u000a      available):\u000a    a. Many Philosophy Departments have formed Climate, or Equity, or Women\u000a      in Philosophy committees as a result of Saul's papers on implicit bias. At\u000a      Sussex, for example, a key causal driver for this impact was the BPA\/SWIP\u000a      report that Saul co-authored with Helen Beebee, which was endorsed by the\u000a      BPA, and presented to a meeting of all UK department heads with a request\u000a      to implement its recommendations (S4).\u000a    b. At UCL, a member of the Philosophy Department reports `[Saul's]\u000a        paper, which many on the Widening Participation committee have read, was\u000a        influential in shaping our ideas about how we should make appointments\u000a        to staff posts. When we advertised some temporary lectureships a year\u000a        ago, we trialled a new procedure, whereby we anonymised the applications\u000a        before circulating them to the committee. This was in consequence of a\u000a        conviction that gender bias (as well as other biases) were likely\u000a        operating, and that a helpful countermeasure would be anonymity. More\u000a        generally, the committee has been monitoring statistics for\u000a        undergraduate and graduate applications, success in admission, and\u000a        achievement and this too has been influenced by the attention drawn by\u000a        your work to unconscious biases.'\u000a    c. As a result of the circulation and discussion of Saul's papers on\u000a      implicit bias, Rutgers University Philosophy Department has launched a\u000a      mentoring scheme; and added online resources about implicit bias and\u000a      stereotype threat.\u000a    d. Saul's paper on implicit bias and stereotype threat is affecting the\u000a      pedagogical training of PhD students teaching philosophy at the University\u000a      of California at Berkeley (S2). e. Research presented at the Implicit Bias\u000a      and Philosophy Research Network has led the Philosophy Department at Trent\u000a      University in Canada to adopt policies aimed at overcoming implicit bias\u000a      and stereotype threat.\u000a    2. Impact on journals: As a result of Saul's work on implicit bias and\u000a      philosophy, Analysis has moved to triple-anonymous review (S3) and\u000a      The Journal of Philosophy has moved to double-anonymous review.\u000a    3. Impact on conference organising: Saul's research provided the\u000a      theoretical underpinning for the Gendered Conference Campaign (http:\/\/feministphilosophers.wordpress.com\/gendered-conference-campaign\/),\u000a     of which Saul was one of the organisers. This campaign calls attention to\u000a      all-male conferences in philosophy, and argues that philosophers should\u000a      try to avoid organising such conferences in order to reduce stereotype\u000a      threat and implicit bias. This campaign has had several impacts:\u000a    \u000a      Impact on organisations such as the British Society for Ethical\u000a        Theory, which as a result has instituted a policy of seeking out women\u000a        invited speakers and has improved its anonymous review process for\u000a        submitted papers.\u000a      Impact on individuals: many individual conference organisers have been\u000a        in touch to tell Saul that they have changed their conference\u000a        organisation practices as a result of the Gendered Conference Campaign.\u000a      [text removed for publication]\u000a      There are three online petitions against all-male conferences (two\u000a        within philosophy and one in the sciences), which have their causal\u000a        origin in the Gendered Conference Campaign. Together, they have more\u000a        than 2500 signatures.\u000a    \u000a    4. Impact on the REF: As a result of Saul's research, a member of the REF\u000a      organisation asked her for advice regarding ways for the Philosophy REF\u000a      panel to improve their practices with regard to gender equity, and the\u000a      panel will be implementing some of the recommendations, including the\u000a      raising of awareness about implicit bias, the use of excellent papers by\u000a      women in the calibration phase and checking ratings statistics against\u000a      gender data for possible evidence of implicit bias.\u000a    5. Impact outside philosophy:\u000a    a. The University of Massachusetts Amherst has now made it possible for\u000a      work to be anonymously marked, as a result of Saul's research (S1).\u000a    b. Forensic Sciences: as a result of Saul's research on bias, she was\u000a      asked to speak at a conference of the Forensic Science Society. She has\u000a      continued consulting with a representative of LGC Forensics, who reports\u000a      that Saul's paper has led her to include bias in discussions regarding DNA\u000a      interpretation and as a potential factor in cases subject to appeal. She\u000a      has just accepted an invitation to join the Advisory Board of the\u000a      Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology at the University of North Texas.\u000a    c. A member of the Psychology Department at Hunter College, who works\u000a      with universities around the world to improve gender equity, makes use of\u000a      the Gendered Conference Campaign and its resources in this work (S5).\u000a    d. The Central European University in Bucharest has now adopted a gender\u000a      equity policy for conference organisation, linking to the Gendered\u000a      Conference Campaign for advice on how to avoid all-male conferences.\u000a    e. As a result of a paper Saul gave to launch the Women at the University\u000a      of Sheffield network, the decoration of a major hall used for examinations\u000a      is being reassessed with particular attention to issues of stereotype\u000a      threat.\u000a    f. The Gendered Conference Campaign inspired a song, `I Like to See the\u000a      Ladies' by the band the 20th Century Monads.\u000a    6.

Professor Jennifer Saul has\u000a      argued (drawing on research from social psychology) that implicit bias and\u000a      stereotype threat are likely to play a key role in the\u000a      under-representation of women in philosophy. Implicit biases are\u000a      unconscious, automatic biases against members of stigmatised groups that\u000a      are often contrary to the genuine conscious commitments of those who hold\u000a      them; stereotype threat is a psychological phenomenon that causes members\u000a      of under-represented groups to underperform. Implicit biases can, for\u000a      example, lead assessors to rate a CV as less impressive if it has a\u000a      woman's rather than a man's name at the top of it. Stereotype threat can\u000a      cause a woman to underperform in high-stakes situations when she is one of\u000a      very few women in the room.\u000a    Saul's research has also suggested various strategies that could be used\u000a      to improve the situation for women in philosophy in the face of the\u000a      problems of implicit bias and stereotype threat. One paper on this topic\u000a      [R1] was widely circulated online starting September 2010: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/lmo6ply\u000a      (The name of this paper was later changed). Saul's research has also\u000a      resulted in a co-authored report for the British Philosophical Association\u000a      and the Society for Women in Philosophy. Both the paper and the report\u000a      argue that implicit bias and stereotype threat are likely to play a role\u000a      in perpetuating the under-representation of women in philosophy. They also\u000a      argue that philosophers have very good reasons&#8212;moral, political and\u000a      academic&#8212;to combat these two issues.\u000a    A related strand of Saul's research explores the implications of implicit\u000a      bias for knowledge, and in particular for expert knowledge&#8212;a topic that\u000a      has been of great interest to forensics professionals. Here she has argued\u000a      that implicit bias is in some ways a greater threat to knowledge\u000a      (including expert knowledge) than traditional scepticism is. This work\u000a      makes crucial use of Christopher Hookway's idea (R5 and R6) that the most\u000a      interesting way to understand scepticism is as what he calls a challenge\u000a      to the reliability of our cognitive instruments. Saul argues that implicit\u000a      biases in some ways pose a far more powerful challenge to our cognitive\u000a      instruments than does traditional scepticism.\u000a    Saul's research includes not just her own single authored papers (and one\u000a      co-authored report), but also the Leverhulme International Research\u000a      Network on Implicit Bias and Philosophy, which brought together\u000a      philosophers, psychologists and practitioners from several countries to\u000a      work through a variety of philosophical issues related to implicit bias.\u000a      This both informed her research and aided in its dissemination.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12157","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The outreach programme run by the Philosophy Department and its students\u000a      has played a crucial role as a medium for communicating our research.\u000a      `Philosophy in the City' (PinC), which was founded in 2006 as a schools\u000a      outreach programme, now has links with eight local schools and other\u000a      institutions involving young people, such as afterschool clubs and the\u000a      Roundabout homeless shelter. A significant part of this activity is\u000a      student-led, where seminars and discussion groups are run by our\u000a      undergraduate and graduate students, based on the sort of research-led\u000a      teaching they have received themselves within the Department. PinC has\u000a      been very successful, serving as a model for programmes developed by other\u000a      departments at Sheffield (such as `History in the City'), while also\u000a      receiving external recognition (for example, in 2007 it came runner up in\u000a      the THES award for Outstanding Contribution to the Local Community).\u000a    From early June 2008, academics in the Department gave lectures at the\u000a      annual PinC conference called `Philosophize!' in which the schools came\u000a      into the University for a day of activities. More recently, teachers\u000a      involved in the programme suggested greater staff involvement and asked us\u000a      to provide lectures in schools, in addition to the seminars run by our\u000a      students. This process began in 2011, with individual staff visiting\u000a      particular schools. We have now intensified this activity with a series of\u000a      school visit days, an educational programme which we have called `The\u000a      Examined Life'. For these events, a variety of schools bring pupils into\u000a      the University for the day. The series has involved over 320 local Y10\u000a      students, from six schools. The main focus of the day is the staff\u000a      lecture, which is then backed up by seminars led by our students. Hopkins\u000a      and Bennett both gave lectures at Silverdale school and Stern and Saul\u000a      spoke at Outwood academy, while Olson, Stern, Hookway, Saul and Shemmer\u000a      have each given lectures to audiences from a variety of local schools in\u000a      the `Examined Life' series.\u000a    There is clear evidence that both forms of activity have been successful.\u000a      Reports from both teachers and students regarding the individual staff\u000a      visits were extremely positive. Commenting on the lectures by Hopkins and\u000a      Bennett at Silverdale, the teacher concerned remarked `Both of the\u000a        lectures were brilliant. Chris Bennett's lecture, and the preliminary\u000a        and follow-up sessions had a profound impact on the way that my students\u000a        thought about punishment. The idea that punishment was something that\u000a        someone might have a right to had never occurred to them previously. Rob\u000a        Hopkins' insights into the emotive aspects of the paradox of fiction\u000a        were equally novel and thought-provoking' [S1].\u000a    The `Examined Life' days have also been highly successful. The Head of\u000a      Philosophy\/RE at Meadowhead School commented on `A fantastic day that\u000a        delved deeper into the issues raised as it evolved through the seminars.\u000a        Students were able to develop their beliefs and challenge others to do\u000a        the same. A thoroughly enjoyable introduction to higher education'\u000a      [S2]. Feedback from the whole body of pupils also showed positive\u000a      engagement with the events, with enjoyment rated at 6\/10 overall, 23% of\u000a      the respondents rating the experience as 8\/10 or above and 28% expressing\u000a      an interest in studying Philosophy at degree level [S3]. Figures from\u000a      Silverdale school alone were even more impressive: 73% said they `thought\u000a      differently about the issues' after the Examined Life days, while 60% said\u000a      they were now more likely to go to university, with 80% saying they would\u000a      now choose Sheffield as the place to study for their degree [S4]. Comments\u000a      include: `Re-evaluated my thoughts on society and morals...influenced\u000a        me to question the origins of my morality more than ever before'; `I now\u000a        understand my concept of morals better', `it makes me think about\u000a        impacts of actions more', `made you think deeper about the things you\u000a        wouldn't normally', `it made me look at other aspects of Philosophy',\u000a        `gave me a chance to voice and discuss my opinions' [S3].\u000a     The success of these activities has led to local schools changing their\u000a      curriculum provision in line with the research areas of the department.\u000a      For example Silverdale school's entire KS4 RE and SMSC provision for Y10\u000a      students is delivered through `The Examined Life' series. Work from\u000a      Silverdale school shows a profound engagement with the research topics.\u000a      For example, a number of student essays now offer animalism as a sensible\u000a      approach to take on questions of personal identity, through exposure to\u000a      Prof Olson's work [S1].\u000a    In addition to the direct impact of our teaching on the school pupils, we\u000a      have also used our research expertise to engage with the teachers\u000a      themselves. On 24th June 2013 we organized a conference for A-level school\u000a      teachers working in philosophy, which was attended by 29 teachers and\u000a      covered 22 schools from across the country. This event enabled us to\u000a      broaden the teachers' understanding of the curriculum, and ways in which\u000a      it might be made of more interest to their pupils, by offering `state of\u000a      the art' accounts of current research, based upon our expertise. The\u000a      conference was a great success, with 71% of attendees rating the subject\u000a      knowledge refreshment aspect as Excellent. 93% felt the conference would\u000a      have a lasting impact (41% at a significant level) upon their teaching.\u000a      Comments included: `interesting new areas I wouldn't have previously\u000a        covered or would have done differently'; `extra \"string to bow\"\u000a        as a CPD\/INSET course'; `the content\/presentation of lectures\u000a        gave me a lot of good ideas for teaching similar areas of the\u000a        curriculum'. All attendees expressed an interest in attending\u000a      similar events in the future and all are keen to work with us to develop\u000a      the format and other school and college events [S5].\u000a\u0009Taken overall,\u000a      therefore, this case study shows how we have delivered impact at the level\u000a      of civil society, cultural life, education, public discourse and public\u000a      service, in the following respects:\u000a    \u000a      informing the intellectual lives of school children, while leading\u000a        them to think about and question various aspects of their ethical and\u000a        social lives, and their heritage\u000a      providing access to advanced philosophical ideas in an accessible way\u000a      helping provide ideas and intellectual skills to enable school\u000a        children to participate in discussions on philosophical issues\u000a      enabling schools to deliver education in these areas more effectively,\u000a        and assisting in the career development of teachers\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Through our very successful schools outreach programme, Philosophy in the\u000a      City, several members of staff have brought their research ideas to school\u000a      students and teachers, with considerable influence both on the students\u000a      themselves and on the way in which philosophy is taught and thought of\u000a      within those schools.

Moreover, as a result of this\u000a      expertise, our staff are in a position to offer guidance to the teachers\u000a      concerning how best to relate to the content of the curriculum, and how\u000a      best to present it to their pupils. The research expertise of staff is\u000a      therefore what has enabled them to have the influence documented within\u000a      this case study, where the relevant research is as follows:\u000a    Chris Bennett's book The Apology Ritual sets out a theory of how\u000a      punishment might be justified, which builds on the justification of\u000a      reactions such as blame and demand for apology [R1]. In chapter three, he\u000a      deals with the criticism that punishment cannot be 'deserved' because our\u000a      actions, and the mental states that lead to action, are not ultimately\u000a      under our control. In response, he argues that, if we look more closely at\u000a      what is going on when we hold someone morally responsible (for instance,\u000a      in expecting an apology), we see that blame is a response to the violation\u000a      of standards that a person can reasonably be expected to meet as a\u000a      self-governing member of a normatively demanding relationship. We thus\u000a      understand that the conditions for moral responsibility lie more in the\u000a      capacity to uphold a certain role within a set of relationships than in\u000a      the ability to exercise absolute control over one's actions and character.\u000a      The lecture looked at the way our aptness for certain sorts of moral\u000a      assessment is a kind of social status, and hence underpinned by conditions\u000a      that do not require ultimate control.\u000a    Chris Hookway's research examines a pragmatist approach to the nature of\u000a      science and knowledge. In chapter two of his recent book [R2], he\u000a      discusses tensions that arise when we take seriously two important ideas.\u000a      The first is that science provides us with knowledge and is aimed at\u000a      obtaining truth. And the second is `fallibilism', the idea that\u000a      that any of our beliefs might be mistaken, or that none of our\u000a      methods of inquiry are guaranteed to provide us with the truth. His\u000a      lecture raised a number of questions about what the aims of scientific\u000a      inquiry: and about just what it means to say that theories are true.\u000a    Robert Hopkins has published on the way we experience cinema and the\u000a      nature of cinematic representation [R3], and how these explain the\u000a      emotional power of film [R4]. His work explores how far our experience of\u000a      film involves illusion, tailoring the precise form such illusion takes\u000a      both to what is independently plausible and to the task of explaining\u000a      film's influence over emotion. He lectured on these issues.\u000a    Eric Olson, lectured on personal identity. This drew on three aspects of\u000a      his research [R5]: how to characterize the problem of personal identity\u000a      over time (which is frequently misunderstood), his criticisms of answers\u000a      to this question based on psychological continuity (which have dominated\u000a      the discussion since Locke), and his inquiries into the metaphysical\u000a      possibility of life after death.\u000a    Jenny Saul's work on sex and gender argues that our ordinary notions of\u000a      these concepts are deeply confused, and that these confusions have\u000a      worrying ethical and political consequences. In her [R7], she explored a\u000a      novel contextualist theory of terms like 'woman' and man', according to\u000a      which these terms sometimes refer to biological concepts based on, for\u000a      example, chromosomes' and sometimes to social concepts based on e.g. roles\u000a      in the family. The presentation she gave to The Examined Life centred\u000a      around the puzzles and confusions found in our ordinary concepts, and the\u000a      ethical and political significance of these puzzles.\u000a    Robert Stern based his talk around his current work on divine command\u000a      theories of moral obligation, which are discussed in his recent book on\u000a      this topic [R8]. In this work, he relates these theories to the problem of\u000a      autonomy, and also considers how far it is possible form them to offer\u000a      `intermediate' accounts, which explain obligation but not goodness by an\u000a      appeal to a divine command. He used these ideas in his lecture to offer a\u000a      defence of such theories against the standard objections based on the\u000a      Euthyphro dilemma, and suggested that alternatives to the divine command\u000a      account are themselves problematic.\u000a    Yonatan Shemmer spoke about the value of philosophy, and the notion of\u000a      `value' itself, where this relates to his recent work concerning\u000a      constructivism vs. realism about value. In his paper [R9], Shemmer\u000a      explores the foundations of the norms of coherence and consistency. He\u000a      argues that these norms ground all other norms and value judgments and\u000a      explores possible ways of justifying these norms. In particular he\u000a      assesses the idea that all justification has an instrumental form whereby\u000a      a norm or value is justified by showing that being guided by it helps to\u000a      promote a more fundamental norm.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15516","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Robson's research on mathematics education in ancient Iraq (e.g., Robson\u000a      2009) has been used extensively to help train modern mathematics teachers\u000a      and to develop mathematics enrichment activities for high-achieving school\u000a      children. From 2005 to 2008 Robson ran annual video- conferences on\u000a      Babylonian mathematics for primary schools in the UK and Pakistan for the\u000a      Motivate: Maths Enrichment for Schools scheme. In 2008 there were four\u000a      video conferences for students aged between 8 and 13 involving eight UK\u000a      schools and two in Karachi.\u000a    A multimedia resource pack [5.1] for KS2\/3 School Mathematics was\u000a      produced in 2010 and made freely available online with funding from the\u000a      university's HEIF 4 Knowledge Transfer Projects allocation. The pack\u000a      includes nine short videos in which Robson discusses Babylonian\u000a      mathematics, mathematical education for trainee scribes and life in\u000a      ancient Iraq. There are accompanying classroom activities and worksheets\u000a      with teacher guidance notes and support materials. The pack has attracted\u000a      over 14,500 page views\/downloads since 2010 and positive feedback from\u000a      mathematics teachers worldwide. One Australian teacher commented on its\u000a      influence on teaching practice: `After looking at your work, I was\u000a      encouraged to bring it into my mathematics classroom &#8212; much to the\u000a      interest of my colleagues in the history and art faculties... My students\u000a      were fascinated by the stories and the mathematics, and we ended the\u000a      lesson in an art room, rolling out clay to make our own tables and working\u000a      out how to make the indentations with the ends of chopsticks' [5.2].\u000a    In the USA, the Professor of Mathematics Education at Florida State\u000a      University [has used Robson's work to develop teacher training programmes\u000a      using cuneiform tablets from the collection of Florida State University [5.3.\u000a        5.4]. In 2008, a classroom instructional unit was created for use\u000a      with 46 students (aged 9 to 11) two classroom mathematics teachers at\u000a      Eustis Elementary School and two district mathematics supervisors as a\u000a      pilot project in Eustis, Florida. The classroom teachers stated that the\u000a      historical perspective and context contributed to increased pupil\u000a      engagement irrespective of their level of ability. One teacher commented:\u000a      `I was amazed at my lower performing students' ability to communicate\u000a      their processing skills ... Almost every student was eager to share their\u000a      ideas regarding the use of the cuneiform tablets. I witnessed my ESE\u000a      [exceptional and special education] students to be more actively involved\u000a      in this lesson than most others. I also observed my higher ability\u000a      students to be more engaged also.' (Evaluation, 11 October 2008: see [5.4]).\u000a    As a result of her research, Robson has received numerous invitations to\u000a      contribute to radio and television programmes about the history of\u000a      mathematics and\/or the history of the Middle East. She gave a mathematical\u000a      tour of the British Museum exhibition Babylon for the BBC Radio 4\u000a      programme More or Less (2009) and used mathematical tablets from the\u000a      British Museum to explain the Babylonian mathematics of time to a modern\u000a      astronomer for another Radio 4 programme (2009). She also contributed to\u000a      the British Museum's outstandingly popular exhibition, museum events,\u000a      radio series and book, A History of the World in 100 Objects (2010), being\u000a      interviewed for episode\/chapter 17 on the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, and\u000a      giving a gallery talk on 18 February 2010, 'Mathematical goddesses in\u000a      Sumerian culture', as part of the History of the World in 100 Objects:\u000a      Poetry, Mathematics, and Myth event. The average reach of the radio series\u000a      was four million; the gallery talk audience was 40, which was\u000a      full-capacity for the venue. In New York, the Institute for the Study of\u000a      the Ancient World staged an exhibition of mathematical cuneiform tablets\u000a      based largely on Robson's work (2010), citing Robson (2007d; 2008) as two\u000a      of the four core books on the subject and also listing four of her earlier\u000a      works in the suggested reading. The exhibition was extended due to popular\u000a      demand, running over eight weeks, attracting a high number of visitors\u000a      including 22 school groups, and receiving substantial positive feedback\u000a      both in the guest book and in the form of student letters [5.5].\u000a      Patricia Fara's recent overview of history of science for a general\u000a      readership, Science: A four thousand year history, opens with a\u000a      chapter on Babylonian mathematics, credited almost exclusively to Robson's\u000a      research ([5.6]: pp. 8-16).

The research was based on three\u000a      strategies: Assyriological, archaeological and socio-historical.\u000a    First, production of the first systematic catalogue, edition and\u000a      translation of nearly 1000 mathematical cuneiform tablets, written in a\u000a      variety of languages: Sumerian, Eblaite, and the Babylonian and Assyrian\u000a      dialects of Akkadian (Robson 2007a; 2007d; 2008a). The tablets are from a\u000a      range of locations, from southwest Iran to eastern Turkey, but mostly from\u000a      southern Iraq, and now housed in museums all over Europe, the Middle East\u000a      and North America. Work was based wherever possible on personal inspection\u000a      and photography (always so for the primary publication of about 100\u000a      tablets, e.g., Robson 2007f) but otherwise reliant on published\u000a      photographs and scale drawings.\u000a    Second, detailed investigation of the textual and archaeological context\u000a      for these tablets. Where all previous studies treated cuneiform\u000a      mathematics as a closed system, this research instead sought evidence for\u000a      the ancient individuals, communities and societies which produced them.\u000a      This entailed close examination of the buildings archaeological\u000a      assemblages in which mathematical tablets were found (e.g., Robson 2009);\u000a      prosopographical research into the practitioners and patrons named and\u000a      described in the mathematical tablets (e.g., Robson 2008c); and\u000a      investigation of references to and descriptions of mathematical practices\u000a      in a range of cuneiform genres from Sumerian literature to Babylonian\u000a      astronomy (e.g., Robson 2007e). It also explored the many complex\u000a      relationships between formal, professionally taught mathematical skills\u000a      and ideologies in ancient Iraq and a variety of informal, domestic and\u000a      artisanal numeracies attested in the writings and objects of the same\u000a      period (e.g., Robson 2007c).\u000a    Third, the use of historical and sociological approaches to account for\u000a      the particular character of mathematics at different times and places in\u000a      ancient Iraq (e.g., Robson 2007b) and to situate it with reference to\u000a      other mathematical cultures of the world (e.g., Robson 2008b). The\u000a      research identified three phases in the development of the cuneiform\u000a      mathematics of ancient Iraq and its neighbours: numerate apprenticeship\u000a      during much of the third millennium BC, during which time most\u000a      mathematical training was on-the-job and thus left little trace in the\u000a      textual and archaeological record; a 500-year period in the late third and\u000a      early second millennium BC, during which time a royal ideology of\u000a      metrological justice promoted formal scribal learning of the mathematical\u000a      properties of lines and areas as the abstraction of fair land measurement\u000a      and division; and, for much of the first millennium BC, the idea of divine\u000a      quantification, in which the gods were seen to have created an inherently\u000a      and subtly mathematised world in which many observable natural phenomena\u000a      were period and predictable. None of these aims or practices had much in\u000a      common with classical or Hellenistic Greek mathematics and were unlikely\u000a      to have influenced them directly (Robson 2008a).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15866","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A key member of Labour Left since it was established, Clack was\u000d\u000a      identified by the founder of Labour Left as providing intellectual support\u000d\u000a      for an ethical socialist vision. He asked her to contribute an essay on\u000d\u000a      ethical socialism for The Red Book, published in November 2011 as\u000d\u000a      an e-book and then as a paperback in January 2012. The book has generated\u000d\u000a      a significant amount of attention: the e-book has been downloaded just\u000d\u000a      under 30,000 times, while around 300 copies of the paperback have been\u000d\u000a      sold. The ideas contained within it have been debated on Labour Party\u000d\u000a      websites and Labour activist blogs. Through its websites, Twitter and\u000d\u000a      Facebook, Clack's essay has prompted discussion about the future direction\u000d\u000a      of Labour Party policy.\u000d\u000a    Charting a shift in political paradigms is rarely straightforward and\u000d\u000a      rarely lineal. The extent to which the ideas put forward by Clack in The\u000d\u000a        Red Book in November 2011 are shaping Labour discourse and policy\u000d\u000a      can be tracked by paralleling parts of it with Ed Miliband's leader's\u000d\u000a      speech to conference a year later in October 2012:\u000d\u000a    a) Clack: \"In order to develop an ethical socialism, the vision\u000d\u000a      of the individual at the heart of the neo-liberal account must be\u000d\u000a      challenged, and this means considering once again the relationship between\u000d\u000a      self and society. According to Aristotle, humans are `social animals' not\u000d\u000a      isolated units...Wellbeing, according to the New Economics Foundation, is\u000d\u000a      to be found not just in the achievement of personal goals, but in a sense\u000d\u000a      of oneself as socially grounded, part of a wider community. To focus on\u000d\u000a      `the individual' is to ignore the fact that we are human precisely because\u000d\u000a      we find our fulfilment in our relationships with each other. We need each\u000d\u000a      other.\" (p. 15).\u000d\u000a    Compared with Miliband: \"One Nation: a country where everyone has\u000d\u000a      a stake. One Nation: a country where prosperity is fairly shared. One\u000d\u000a      Nation: where we have a shared destiny, a sense of shared endeavour and a\u000d\u000a      common life that we lead together.\" And similarly, \"with so many people\u000d\u000a      having been told for so long that the only way to get on is to be on your\u000d\u000a      own, in it for yourself, we just can't succeed as a country.\"\u000d\u000a    b) Clack: \"A society recognising the value of all its parts would\u000d\u000a      look rather different from ours. Pay differentials between the top and the\u000d\u000a      bottom are shockingly out of proportion. These economic inequalities\u000d\u000a      suggest a society that has failed to think about what makes for society in\u000d\u000a      the first place; such failings must be addressed\" (p. 18).\u000d\u000a    Compared with Miliband: \"With the gap between rich and poor\u000d\u000a      growing wider and wider, we just can't succeed as a country. With millions\u000d\u000a      of people feeling that hard work and effort are not rewarded, we just\u000d\u000a      can't succeed as a country.\" And \"I will never accept an economy where the\u000d\u000a      gap between rich and poor just grows wider and wider. In One Nation, in my\u000d\u000a      faith, inequality matters.\"\u000d\u000a    c) Clack: \"Consider New Labour's promotion of `aspiration.'...The\u000d\u000a      problem with such an ideal is that it targets the aspiration of `gifted'\u000d\u000a      individuals without thinking about the kind of society that enables all to\u000d\u000a      flourish. Considering the way in which aspiration has been connected to\u000d\u000a      education exposes the paucity of this vision...What is desperately needed\u000d\u000a      is an holistic vision of society where the contribution of all its parts\u000d\u000a      is recognised and treated with dignity and respect.\"\u000d\u000a    Compared with Miliband: \"You see for a long time our party has\u000d\u000a      been focused on getting 50% of young people into university. I believe\u000d\u000a      that was right. But now it's time to put our focus on the forgotten 50%\u000d\u000a      who do not go to university.\"\u000d\u000a    d) Clack: \"a society that values all and that understands the\u000d\u000a      importance of strong communities as supportive places for individual\u000d\u000a      flourishing\" (p.19).\u000d\u000a    Compared with Miliband: \"a country for all, with everyone playing\u000d\u000a      their part\".\u000d\u000a    The relevance of ethical socialism for framing contemporary left politics\u000d\u000a      was first discussed at a Labour Party fringe event at the national\u000d\u000a      conference held in Liverpool in 2012. Clack spoke on a panel that included\u000d\u000a      the Chair of Labour Left and Labour MP for Easington. From this event came\u000d\u000a      a collaborative writing partnership with the Vice-Chair of Labour Left and\u000d\u000a      Clack now blogs regularly for the Huffington Post UK Labour site. She has\u000d\u000a      also written for the main Labour blog, Labour List, exploring the theme of\u000d\u000a      kindness as a political virtue.\u000d\u000a    As Chair of the Oxfordshire group of Labour Left, Clack organised and\u000d\u000a      spoke at a Red Book discussion on Ethical Socialism at Ruskin College\u000d\u000a      Oxford in February 2012. This attracted a large audience drawn from the\u000d\u000a      local party, the local Labour Women's Group, as well as members from\u000d\u000a      further afield. A follow up event took place in May 2013 when she\u000d\u000a      discussed with the political commentator Bill Keegan the legacy of Gordon\u000d\u000a      Brown and the lessons Labour policy makers might learn after the financial\u000d\u000a      crisis.\u000d\u000a    The renewal of interest in issues of ethics and the need to discuss more\u000d\u000a      explicitly the values that underpin political decision-making led to a\u000d\u000a      further invitation to speak at a fringe event at the 2013 Labour Party\u000d\u000a      conference fringe on Ethics in Public Life. Having been elected as a\u000d\u000a      Labour and Co-operative Party councillor in Oxford in May 2012, Clack\u000d\u000a      spoke as a philosopher who is also a local politician. This debate on\u000d\u000a      ethics took the form of Clack debating, with the MP for West Bromwich\u000d\u000a      East, the impact of the Leveson Enquiry. The points highlighted by Clack\u000d\u000a      focussed on the challenge it poses to the last 30 years of neo-liberal\u000d\u000a      consumerist values and the importance of moving towards policies that\u000d\u000a      enshrine a more communitarian form of society.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Labour Left, the Labour Party Think Tank, is a grassroots organisation\u000d\u000a      developing new public discourses that aim to move Labour towards an\u000d\u000a      ethical socialist position.

Her work with Labour Left draws explicitly upon aspects of her\u000d\u000a      research which relate the subject to civil society.\u000d\u000a    This distinctive approach is set out in two sets of publications:\u000d\u000a    Firstly, in her book Sex and Death (2002), Clack argued that\u000d\u000a      accepting one's mortality enables a deeper relationship with the world and\u000d\u000a      others, in contrast to approaches focused on ideals of transcendence.\u000d\u000a      Recognising vulnerability enables the significance of relationship to be\u000d\u000a      placed at the heart of life and thus to affect how human beings might live\u000d\u000a      with each other. This conclusion was also developed in Philosophy of\u000d\u000a        Religion: A Critical Introduction (1st edition1998; 2nd edition\u000d\u000a      2008). The final chapter of each edition grounded philosophical reflection\u000d\u000a      in consideration of contemporary issues. In the first edition, this\u000d\u000a      involved arguing for an account of religion that took seriously\u000d\u000a      secularisation. In the second, this shifted to an analysis of 9\/11\u000d\u000a      terrorist attacks and the effect living in what was then being described\u000d\u000a      as `the Age of Terror' might have on understandings of religion. In a\u000d\u000a      recent article, `Philosophy of Religion in an Age of Austerity: Towards a\u000d\u000a      Socially Engaged Philosophy for the Well-Lived Life', Clack considered the\u000d\u000a      challenges austerity poses for constructing a well-lived life.\u000d\u000a    Secondly, alongside proposing practical applications for philosophy of\u000d\u000a      religion, Clack has worked with educationalists to influence the\u000d\u000a      identification of wellbeing as a key driver for public policy. This\u000d\u000a      included the role of co-investigator for the ESRC seminar series `Changing\u000d\u000a      Notions of the Human Subject: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Emotional\u000d\u000a      Well-being and Social Justice in Education Policy and Practice' (2008).\u000d\u000a      This series of seminars brought together historians, psychologists and\u000d\u000a      philosophers with policy makers, political commentators and politicians.\u000d\u000a      Clack organised and spoke at the seminar on philosophical accounts of\u000d\u000a      well-being. The series enabled a critical perspective on well-being as a\u000d\u000a      policy initiative to develop, while also helping Clack to formulate, more\u000d\u000a      explicitly than had hitherto been the case, an understanding of the\u000d\u000a      practical and more directly political implications of her philosophical\u000d\u000a      position. This resulted in the article `What Difference Does It Make?\u000d\u000a      Philosophical Perspectives on the Nature of Wellbeing and the Role of\u000d\u000a      Educational Practice'. This article translates well-being into the\u000d\u000a      well-lived life: a concern under explored in the policy material and which\u000d\u000a      raises issues for future education policy. Routledge will publish this\u000d\u000a      edition in a new series during 2014, showing something of the scope of\u000d\u000a      influence of this theme. `The Human Face of Socialism' (The Red Book,\u000d\u000a      2012) explores the policies that might emanate from thinking about what\u000d\u000a      constitutes the well-lived life. Challenging the neo-liberal account of\u000d\u000a      the individual as consumer, it suggests ways of changing working practices\u000d\u000a      to accommodate a deeper sense of wellbeing.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18006","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    O'Neill has spoken to dozens of audiences about the topic of trust:\u000a      mainly professional and managerial bodies, charities, civil service.\u000a      Significant audiences since 2008 have included:\u000a    - Royal Statistical Society, Beveridge Memorial Lecture 2009 [5.1]\u000a    - National Council for Voluntary Organisations, Hinton Lecture 2010,\u000a      Onora O'Neill `Can Trust be Rebuilt?'

Since her retirement she has remained very active in\u000a      the Faculty, which still serves as her research base.\u000a    Her work in moral philosophy is inspired by Kant. Kantian moral\u000a      philosophy emphasises the importance both of the autonomy of the moral\u000a      agent, and their duty to a moral law whose nature is discovered by reason.\u000a      O'Neill has developed a specifically Kantian conception of autonomy in a\u000a      number of works, such as Towards Justice and Virtue (1996) [3.1]\u000a      and Autonomy and Trust in Bioethics (2002) [3.2]. Her\u000a      conception of trust derives from her non-individualistic conception of\u000a      autonomy, where autonomy is conceived of as a more complex phenomenon than\u000a      the mere freedom to choose. (Her ideas on trust were articulated for the\u000a      general public in her 2002 BBC Reith Lectures [3.3]).\u000a    According to O'Neill's Kantian conception of morality, we do not embark\u000a      on personal relationships from a position where we have to establish on\u000a      some independent basis which people we can trust and which we cannot.\u000a      Rather, we know that we can trust some people in certain contexts and\u000a      others in others, and we need a more refined conception of how we are\u000a      sensitive to the evidence of who is trustworthy about what\u000a      subject-matters.\u000a    O'Neill argues that the so-called `crisis of trust' in public life arises\u000a      not because people are in general untrustworthy (something we know to be\u000a      not true) but rather because there is an attitude or culture of suspicion.\u000a      We need to place trust in people carefully, not because we should be\u000a      sceptical of the trustworthiness of everybody, but because we should be\u000a      sensitive to the specific contextual evidence for when and where people\u000a      should be trusted.\u000a    Accordingly, she asks what practical norms should govern the placement of\u000a      trust: how should we `trust well'? She does not therefore directly address\u000a      the question of what trust is, but rather the question of when we should\u000a      find people trustworthy: `to place and refuse trust intelligently we need\u000a      first to judge others' trustworthiness, or their lack of trustworthiness,\u000a      in specific matters. Only when we can do so, will we be in a position to\u000a      place and refuse trust intelligently'. If we are to place trust\u000a      intelligently then we must be able to `grasp relevant evidence and\u000a      distinguish cases, and in particular get some sense of others' competence,\u000a      honesty and reliability in the relevant matters' [3.3]. Hence it\u000a      is crucial that in coming to understand trustworthiness, we also come to\u000a      understand how to apply these empirical, evidential details in particular\u000a      cases.\u000a    In public life this means that we need to pay more attention to the\u000a      accuracy of information provided to us. In the specific context of the\u000a      so-called `crisis of trust' in public life, O'Neill concludes that the\u000a      root cause of the problem here is an attitude or culture of suspicion. But\u000a      this suspicion is, as a general attitude, unjustified: particular reasons\u000a      for suspicion need to be assessed in particular practical contexts.\u000a    O'Neill's general thesis is that there is no general mechanism for\u000a      assessing trust, and that we should therefore be sceptical of excessive\u000a      regulations which attempt to enforce transparency and accountability in\u000a      public life, well-motivated as they may be. These regulations can have the\u000a      effect of undermining trust, rather than enforcing it.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18008","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    O'Neill research has had an impact via a variety of routes. Drawing on\u000a      her expertise in moral\u000a      philosophy and bioethics, O'Neill served on House of Lords select\u000a      committees on genomic\u000a      medicine (2008-2009) [5.1], nanotechnology and food (2009) [5.2]\u000a      and Behavioural Change (2011)\u000a      [5.3]. She was elected as Chair of the Nuffield Foundation\u000a      (1998-2010) and on 19 May 2011 she\u000a      gave the Foundation's annual public lecture, on the topic `Broadening\u000a      bioethics: clinical ethics,\u000a      public health and global health' [5.4]. Since 2012, she has been\u000a      Chair of the Equality and Human\u000a      Rights Commission [5.5] and also an expert lay member on the\u000a      Medical Research Council [5.6],\u000a      and she chairs the MRC's Ethics, Regulation and Public Involvement\u000a      Committee, whose role is `to\u000a      advise Council on policy concerning the conduct of research involving\u000a      human participants\u000a      (including personal information and human biological material) and\u000a      animals, with respect to ethics,\u000a      legislation and regulation' [5.7]. In 2008, she was awarded an\u000a      honorary degree from the University\u000a      of Newcastle. On the occasion of this award, it was said that `she has a\u000a      knack for making rigorous\u000a      analysis highly accessible to non-specialists. Few can match the flair\u000a      with which she successfully\u000a      marries lucidity to conciseness,' and that her `work has been key to the\u000a      creation of an enabling\u000a      environment' in stem cell research in the UK [5.8].\u000a    However, the focus of this case study is the impact on policy debate\u000a      achieved via her contribution\u000a      to the Commission on Assisted Dying in 2011. The Commission's brief was to\u000a      consider the current\u000a      state of the law on assisted dying, assisted suicide and voluntary\u000a      euthanasia. O'Neill gave\u000a      evidence to the Commission on 19 January 2011 [5.9]. In her\u000a      submission, she discussed three\u000a      different conceptions of autonomy: an idealized Kantian conception\u000a      (choosing according to\u000a      universalisable principles, something which she argued has little\u000a      relevance to medical ethics), a\u000a      simple conception of autonomy as `mere sheer choice', and a\u000a      non-individualistic conception of the\u000a      autonomous agent (also inspired by Kant) who balances their own needs with\u000a      the needs and\u000a      desires of others. Individual freedom of choice can be limited by the\u000a      circumstances of choice, and\u000a      the fully autonomous agent will recognize this. She then argued that such\u000a      abstract conceptions of\u000a      autonomy should not be applied slavishly in these discussions and that a\u000a      more practical approach\u000a      was needed.\u000a    Based on the views developed in the research cited above, she expressed\u000a      some skepticism about\u000a      the need for the law to be changed to allow assisted dying in any\u000a      straightforward way. Safeguards\u000a      are needed, and even as it currently is, the law will not provide a simple\u000a      decision procedure for\u000a      when various real cases of assisted dying should be the basis of\u000a      prosecution.\u000a    Ranging more broadly, O'Neill argued that a full discussion of this\u000a      question requires us to think\u000a      more openly about how we approach dying in general, in a society like\u000a      ours. She argued forcefully\u000a      for a more thought-out approach to, and more support for, palliative care\u000a      and hospice care.\u000a    Although the Commission concluded that the current state of the law on\u000a      assisted dying was\u000a      unsustainable, O'Neill's views were noted by the Commission:\u000a    `Baroness Onora O'Neill's evidence also highlighted the philosophical and\u000a      practical limits to the\u000a      concept of autonomy. She began by identifying three very different\u000a      conceptions of autonomy\u000a      employed in public and political debate: \"Kantian autonomy\",\u000a      \"existentialist autonomy\" and\u000a      \"rationalist autonomy\", and went on to explore their social and legal\u000a      implications...She said that the\u000a      more precise Kantian conception of autonomy \"plays almost no part in\u000a      contemporary debate on\u000a      medical ethics\". Instead, the more contemporary \"existentialist\" and\u000a      \"rationalist\" conceptions of\u000a      individual autonomy predominate public conceptions of autonomy... Baroness\u000a      O'Neill then\u000a      contrasted these \"endlessly complicated\" theoretical conceptions of\u000a      autonomy with a more\u000a      practical approach to the concept of autonomy, which she said was inspired\u000a      by the many letters\u000a      she received from members of the public when Lord Joffe's Assisted Dying\u000a      for the Terminally Ill Bill\u000a      was being debated... She commented finally in her evidence to us: \"I do\u000a      not believe that it is\u000a      possible to draft adequate safeguards without invoking misleading and\u000a      unrealisable fantasies\u000a      about individual autonomy... Whatever one thinks about the legitimacy of\u000a      assisted suicide it's not\u000a      legislatable; not safely legislatable\".' [5.10]\u000a    In addition, her argument that more adequate care needs to be provided in\u000a      general at the end of\u000a      life was endorsed in one of the Report's main conclusions:\u000a    `The issue of assisted dying cannot be viewed in isolation from the need\u000a      for adequate health and\u000a      social care or from the need to protect terminally ill people from the\u000a      risk of abuse or indirect social\u000a      pressure to end their lives, if such an option were to become available.\u000a      Therefore if an assisted\u000a      dying framework is to be implemented in the future, it must have these\u000a      concerns at its heart and its\u000a      purpose must be viewed as providing all people with access to high quality\u000a      end of life care.' [5.11]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Baroness Professor Onora O'Neill has applied ideas derived from her\u000a      extensive research in the\u000a      field of moral philosophy to substantive practical questions in bioethics:\u000a      for example, what is it for\u000a      patients to give their consent? Should assisted dying be legalised? And\u000a      more generally, what kinds\u000a      of safeguards should be employed to protect patients?

Neil Manson, with\u000a      whom she collaborated on some major research, was a postdoctoral research\u000a      fellow at King's\u000a      College Cambridge from 1998-2005.\u000a    O'Neill's work in bioethics is motivated by her more theoretical work on\u000a      moral philosophy. The idea\u000a      that moral agents are autonomous &#8212; that they act, in some sense, out of\u000a      their own motivation and\u000a      nature &#8212; has been a dominant idea in ethics, and in bioethics too. Yet\u000a      O'Neill argues that the\u000a      conceptions of individual autonomy so widely relied on in bioethics are\u000a      philosophically and ethically\u000a      inadequate. In a number of works [3.1-3.3] she proposes a more\u000a      Kantian, non-individualistic\u000a      conception of autonomy, which provides a stronger basis for a better\u000a      approach in bioethics. For\u000a      O'Neill, autonomy is not a matter of mere `existentialist' freedom of\u000a      choice, nor of simply acting as\u000a      some idealised version of reason demands, but rather should be understood\u000a      as a property of\u000a      principles of action: `Principles of action are Kantianly autonomous only\u000a      if they are law-like in form\u000a      and could be universal in scope; they are heteronomous if, although\u000a      law-like in form, they cannot\u000a      have universal scope' [3.3: p.1]. So it is a mistake to think of Kantian\u000a      autonomy in terms of agents\u000a      going about their business universalizing; it is rather that their actions\u000a      are universalisable if they\u000a      are governed by autonomous principles in the Kantian sense.\u000a    In Rethinking Informed Consent (2007) [3.2] Neil Manson\u000a      and O'Neill apply some of these ideas to\u000a      the question of consent in medical ethics. They argue that informed\u000a      consent can never be wholly\u000a      specific or explicit, and indeed, it would not be a good thing if it were.\u000a      In addition, Manson and\u000a      O'Neill argue that consent needs a particular kind of communicative\u000a      transaction, by which other\u000a      obligations, prohibitions, and rights can be waived or set aside in\u000a      controlled and specific ways.\u000a    The upshot of this research is that we should not expect that bioethics\u000a      can provide a set of rules or\u000a      procedures which remove the need for trust, trustworthiness and\u000a      interpretation.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18010","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Sex, Culture and Justice has had an unusually significant impact\u000a      on public discourse, perhaps because, as one reviewer put it, `Plenty of\u000a      feminists have tried to write books that have an impact on &#8212; in the sense\u000a      of altering &#8212; mainstream, androcentric, liberal theory.

Chambers's book\u000a      deftly avoids both of these problems, so there is real potential here for\u000a      this book to alter mainstream liberal thinking' Faith Armitage Feminist\u000a        Review (2009) 91: 200-203 [5.1].\u000a    Two examples in particular illustrate how the book has had an impact on\u000a      public discourse:\u000a\u0009  \u000a    \u000aAdoption of Chamber's work by the UK Feminista\u000a        campaign in 2012 and subsequent media appearances\u000a\u000a\u0009  \u000a    The Feminista campaign argued for a legal ban on the advertising\u000a      of certain cosmetic surgery practices. Chambers was an invited signatory\u000a      to the campaign's launch [5.2, 5.3] and an excerpt from her work\u000a      was chosen to be Feminista's first `thinkpiece' on its website [5.4,\u000a        5.5]. This was a result of the fact that one of the Feminista\u000a      organisers had read her work some time before: `I read some of your work\u000a      as a masters student a few years ago and now coming to run this campaign I\u000a      think that you would bring brilliant insight to the discussion with regard\u000a      to notions of choice and women's autonomy in the context of cosmetic\u000a      surgery as a harmful practice and gender inequalities in the UK' (Policy\u000a      and Campaigns Manager, UK Feminista) [5.6].\u000a    On the basis of the Feminista piece, Chambers was invited onto\u000a      BBC Woman's Hour [5.7]: `Having recently read some extracts from\u000a      your book Sex, Culture, and Justice on the UK Feminista\u000a      website, you sprung to mind as someone who could give us a really great\u000a      insight into how ideas of social norms are bringing more and more women to\u000a      have invasive surgery' (Producer, BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour) [5.8].\u000a      The context was a debate on cosmetic surgery and the concept of what is\u000a      `normal'.

The General Secretary of the Fabian Society (one of the\u000a      participants in the IPPR event) wrote that `Clare Chambers's presentation\u000a      combined the rigour of academic political theory with a focus on\u000a      real-world dilemmas relevant to her audience of political practitioners.\u000a      In highlighting the paradox of freely-chosen and enjoyed activities which\u000a      are also harmful, Chambers brought a new dimension to the Fabian Society's\u000a      on-going thinking on the limits of choice and markets in social democratic\u000a      politics. The questions of how to approach choice is critical to the\u000a      Society's efforts to promote new thinking within the British left that\u000a      moves beyond the conceptual and policy toolkit of new Labour's version of\u000a      liberalism.

In Sex, Culture\u000a        and Justice, however, Chambers argues that a just society cannot be\u000a      grounded solely on the fact of individual choice. She begins from the\u000a      observation that autonomous individuals often choose to do things that\u000a      harm themselves or undermine their equality. In particular, women often\u000a      choose to participate in practices of sexual inequality-cosmetic surgery,\u000a      gendered patterns of work and childcare, makeup, restrictive clothing, or\u000a      the sexual subordination required by membership in certain religious\u000a      groups. She goes on to argue that this predicament poses a fundamental\u000a      challenge to many existing liberal and multicultural theories that\u000a      dominate contemporary political philosophy. She argues that a theory of\u000a      justice cannot ignore the influence of culture and the role it plays in\u000a      shaping choices. If cultures shape choices, it is problematic to use those\u000a      choices as the measure of the justice of the culture. Drawing upon\u000a      feminist critiques of gender inequality and poststructuralist theories of\u000a      social construction, she argues that we should accept some of the\u000a      multicultural claims about the importance of culture in shaping our\u000a      actions and identities, but that we should reach the opposite normative\u000a      conclusion to that of multiculturalists and many liberals. Rather than\u000a      using the idea of social construction to justify cultural respect or\u000a      protection, we should use it to ground a critical stance toward cultural\u000a      norms. The book presents radical proposals for state action to promote\u000a      sexual and cultural justice.\u000a    One case that is of particular relevance to this case study and that\u000a      Chambers discusses at length in her book is cosmetic surgery (for example,\u000a      breast implants). Many women feel that their lives would be improved by\u000a      such surgery. Chambers argued that these views are ultimately damaging to\u000a      women and to their equality, even if the decision to undergo these\u000a      operations is taken voluntarily. So a genuinely just society &#8212; which aims\u000a      at equality &#8212; ought to limit voluntary choice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18011","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Museum practice: Embryos in Wax has stimulated many\u000a      medical, anatomical, zoological, and embryological museums and institutes\u000a      internationally to catalogue and effectively display permanent collections\u000a      of Ziegler models that previously languished unlabelled in store\u000a      cupboards. By providing an accessible illustrated history, photographs of\u000a      almost all models, tabulated information and extensive documentation, it\u000a      has enabled curators to label and contextualize once-nondescript objects.\u000a      As a result many institutes engage with their own histories by exhibiting\u000a      the oldest objects routinely to have survived on their premises. The\u000a      initial impact was between 2002 and 2008, but has continued strongly as\u000a      new institutions make use. Recent examples include Oxford University\u000a      Museum of Natural History (2008), Birmingham Medical School (2011), the\u000a      Alfred Denny Museum, Sheffield (2011) and a major new database of German\u000a      university collections (2010-12) [1].

At\u000a      Birmingham and Sheffield, Embryos in Wax also enabled the models\u000a      to be displayed in a wider context to students and the general public.

Making Visible Embryos directly informed\u000a      the choice of several images and their interpretation in the new permanent\u000a      display (2012) [3]. The research further shaped such major\u000a      temporary exhibitions as `Exquisite Bodies' at Wellcome Collection, London\u000a      (July-October 2009), for which Hopwood acted as a consultant [4].\u000a      Embryos in Wax was read by the lead curator, directed the choice of\u000a      exhibits, informed the loan of Ziegler models and was made available in a\u000a      reading area, bibliography and bookshop to the 52,667 visitors [5].\u000a      Embryos in Wax is also used in auction catalogues [6].\u000a    Public engagement and debate: Making Visible Embryos has\u000a      stimulated discussion and use of historic embryo images.

Specific impacts include: a\u000a      review at jezebel.com, the major postfeminist critique site (1.5M visits\u000a      per month in 2010) that generated several pages of comments on uses of\u000a      embryo images in abortion debates [8]; bloggers, other writers and\u000a      academics copying selected images and adding their own comments or\u000a      histories; schoolchildren using the site for projects; and use by\u000a      embryologists, sonographers and others to provide a historical perspective\u000a      on their work. Hopwood's Isis article intervened authoritatively\u000a      in the international controversy in evolutionary developmental biology,\u000a      and especially in the United States between creationists and evolutionists\u000a      over Haeckel's embryos, to improve the quality of evidence and argument.\u000a      E.g., it has been cited since 2008 on the website of the leading\u000a      anticreationist organization, the National Center for Science Education,\u000a      as a `comprehensive' investigation that rebuts claims of fraud [9].\u000a    Teaching: The research has enriched undergraduate and postgraduate\u000a      teaching at other HEIs by opening up new topics and approaches in HPSM and\u000a      neighbouring fields. Since 2009, for example, the `Visualising Science'\u000a      module of the University of Kent Science communication MSc has included a\u000a      session on embryo images, using Making Visible Embryos as the main\u000a      resource and Embryos in Wax and other work by Hopwood as key\u000a      readings [10]. Innovatively, Embryos in Wax and Models\u000a      have not only brought the history of 3-D models as a topic into the\u000a      higher-education curriculum&#8212;chapters from Models feature on many\u000a      reading lists internationally (e.g., a history of medicine survey,\u000a      University of Toronto)&#8212;they have also inspired collections-based\u000a      pedagogical projects. At the HPS Centre at Leeds, for example, Embryos\u000a        in Wax has since 2007 `been central to our ways of thinking about\u000a      our collection', which in 2012 was built up into a Museum of the History\u000a      of Science, Technology and Medicine [11]. Thanks to Embryos in\u000a        Wax, Ziegler models&#8212;previously all but unknown to\u000a      non-specialists&#8212;have become `the flagship objects' in this teaching\u000a      collection, and the book `has typically been the first port of call for\u000a      students conducting collections research and has greatly informed their\u000a      thinking' [12]. Through student projects the book `involved\u000a      students in new kinds of learning about conservation, display [and]\u000a      research'. Hopwood's research inspired a regular third-year philosophy of\u000a      biology seminar at Leeds, in which undergraduates have been shown Ziegler\u000a      models and asked to `consider [their] relations to evidence, theory,\u000a      medical education and practice ... [and] the craft and business of\u000a      model-making.' It is `unusual for [such a] course to incorporate the\u000a      material heritage of science'; at Leeds, `it had never happened before ...\u000a      it happened ... thanks to [Hopwood's] work' [13, 14].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Nick Hopwood's Embryos in Wax (2002) has impacted on museum\u000a      practice by enabling curators of many local and national collections to\u000a      catalogue the most important embryological models and display them\u000a      informatively in permanent and major temporary exhibitions.

He uncovered how in the nineteenth and twentieth\u000a      centuries anatomists and zoologists collaborated with artists to produce\u000a      serial representations of embryonic development that came to stand for the\u000a      course of a pregnancy and the history of life on earth and so to replace\u000a      competing views. Hopwood argued in `Producing development' (2000) that\u000a      these developmental series resulted from linked practices of collecting,\u000a      image-making, ordering, selecting and publication or display. This\u000a      contributed specifically and significantly to the interpretation of\u000a      embryological artefacts, especially wax models and printed images, and\u000a      more generally to historical studies of visual culture.\u000a    Embryos in Wax (2002) was the first and remains the definitive\u000a      guide to the output of the leading producer of academic wax models between\u000a      the 1850s and the 1930s. With Embryos in Wax and his contributions\u000a      to Models: The Third Dimension of Science (2004) Hopwood took a\u000a      lead in promoting a reevaluation of the history of 3-D models in the\u000a      sciences. He demonstrated how engaging with this previously neglected\u000a      medium could (i) uncover important aspects of past research as well as\u000a      teaching, (ii) highlight the politics of medium choice, and (iii) inform\u000a      reflection on the digital revolution.\u000a    Hopwood's other major focus has been on interpreting the making and uses\u000a      of printed pictures, both agreed technical standards and images that have\u000a      become standard through copying. The articles in Bulletin of the\u000a        History of Medicine (2000) and History of Science (2005)\u000a      revealed how normal plates, tables and stages were made authoritative\u000a      visual standards in embryology and developmental biology. The Isis\u000a      article offered the first archivally-based history of the most\u000a      controversial and some of the most successful pictures in the history of\u000a      science. Originally published in 1874, their author, the German Darwinist\u000a      Ernst Haeckel, was accused of fraud in major debates in the 1870s and\u000a      1908-10, but the figures were nevertheless reproduced in twentieth-century\u000a      high-school and college textbooks until 1997, when they sparked a third\u000a      controversy. In this recent debate, creationist advocates of so-called\u000a      `intelligent design' targeted authors and publishers through activism\u000a      around textbook adoption, science standards and legislation. Hopwood's\u000a      article showed definitively that Haeckel's questionable actions are not\u000a      well described as fraud, and that few competent contemporaries initially\u000a      saw the plates in this way, and opened up the case as a prime example of\u000a      the making of an icon of knowledge.\u000a    The online exhibition Making Visible Embryos synthesized all this\u000a      work, added new research and presented the result as the only substantial,\u000a      long-term survey of the history of human embryology in any medium. It\u000a      stresses the work of visualization and contains many expertly interpreted,\u000a      high-quality images, most of them displayed online for the first time.\u000a      Produced in collaboration with Tatjana Buklijas, a postdoc employed by the\u000a      University for the academic year 2004-5 as website researcher and\u000a      designer, the exhibition has been an influential experiment in presenting\u000a      research in history of science and medicine online.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18012","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Lewens' research into risk, trust and bioethics has had broad impact\u000d\u000a      across government, industry and the policy sector more generally.\u000d\u000a    Lewens' work on risk and precaution (Lewens 2008) was cited in the\u000d\u000a      Nuffield Council on Bioethics' recent (2011) report on Human Bodies:\u000d\u000a      Donation for Treatment and Research [1, p. 146]. As a Council member, and\u000d\u000a      working party member, Lewens took a leading role in writing the report's\u000d\u000a      ethical framework for donation, and that framework drew in important ways\u000d\u000a      on his own background work on altruism (outlined in Lewens (2007b)). An\u000d\u000a      official at the Nuffield Council clarified Lewens' involvement as follows:\u000d\u000a      \"The ethical framework in the Council's 2011 report Human Bodies: donation\u000d\u000a      for medicine and research derived substantially from the original ethical\u000d\u000a      analysis undertaken by Tim Lewens (a member both of the Working Party and\u000d\u000a      of the Council itself): in particular his detailed analysis of the\u000d\u000a      different claims associated with 'altruism', and his subsequent\u000d\u000a      categorisation of particular forms of encouragement to donate bodily\u000d\u000a      material as either 'altruist-focused' (interventions that act through\u000d\u000a      encouraging altruistic motivations) or 'non-altruist-focused'\u000d\u000a      (interventions that may act to encourage donation, regardless of whether\u000d\u000a      or not the potential donor may experience altruistic motivations). This\u000d\u000a      consideration of altruism was fundamental in shaping the Working Party's\u000d\u000a      consideration of the role of incentives in the context of donation. In the\u000d\u000a      additional contested area of consent for donation ('opt-in' vs. 'opt-out'\u000d\u000a      arguments for organ donation in particular), Tim's analysis of the\u000d\u000a      justifications offered for non-health opt-out schemes (such as those used\u000d\u000a      for occupational pensions) was vital in leading the working party to\u000d\u000a      conclude that the key ethical requirement in this area should be to ensure\u000d\u000a      that the taking of bodily materials after death should be based on the\u000d\u000a      clearest possible information as to the person's wishes.\" [2]\u000d\u000a    The report's recommendation for increasing payment to egg donors was\u000d\u000a      taken up by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). [3]\u000d\u000a      Lewens' own involvement in working on the Human Bodies report, especially\u000d\u000a      with respect to its discussion of `opt-in' and `opt-out' consent schemes\u000d\u000a      for donation, resulted in an invitation to give oral evidence to the Welsh\u000d\u000a      National Assembly in January 2013, in connection with its new Human\u000d\u000a      Transplantation (Wales) Bill [4]. His comments during the evidence session\u000d\u000a      on the need for clarity in communication associated with the proposed\u000d\u000a      changes to an `opt-out' system of consent, on the ethical defensibility of\u000d\u000a      a system of `presumed consent', and on the need to ensure suitable\u000d\u000a      donation of materials for research purposes were all translated into\u000d\u000a      recommendations in the National Assembly's Stage 1 Committee Report,\u000d\u000a      published in March 2013 [5]. Lewens was named several times in this report\u000d\u000a      as the source for these recommendations. He was subsequently invited (in\u000d\u000a      April 2013) by the Human Tissue Authority (HTA)&#8212;the official regulatory\u000d\u000a      body responsible for overseeing uses of human tissues&#8212;to offer advice and\u000d\u000a      comment on its draft Code of Conduct applying to the new Welsh Legislation\u000d\u000a      [6]. The Director of Strategy and Quality at the HTA has explained that\u000d\u000a      \"Dr Lewens was keen to work with us and his input on stressing the\u000d\u000a      legislation was permissive rather than prescriptive, that Specialist\u000d\u000a      Nurses for Organ Donation do have discretion and this should be\u000d\u000a      highlighted and that there should be no inference that deemed consent was\u000d\u000a      a lesser form of consent, all added significantly to the second draft of\u000d\u000a      the document. Dr Lewens also suggested drafting amendments to change the\u000d\u000a      tone of the document, which were a great help and we believe make the\u000d\u000a      redraft more accessible. The draft document would not be either as well\u000d\u000a      drafted or well thought through without the input of Dr Lewens, and we are\u000d\u000a      grateful for his support.\" [6]\u000d\u000a    Lewens' work on trust, precaution, human nature and genetic enhancement\u000d\u000a      (Lewens 2004, Lewens 2009, Lewens and John 2010, Lewens 2012) has been\u000d\u000a      cited by two further Nuffield Council reports: one entitled Emerging\u000d\u000a      Biotechnologies (2012), another entitled Novel Techniques for the\u000d\u000a      Prevention of Mitochondrial DNA Disorders (2012) [7, pp. 54, 60, 61].\u000d\u000a      Again, Lewens was centrally involved in formulating the ethical arguments\u000d\u000a      relating to identity and germ-line interventions which underpinned the\u000d\u000a      Mitochondrial Disorders report [8]. The Director of the Nuffield Council,\u000d\u000a      has stated that \"The role that Tim Lewens played in the preparation and\u000d\u000a      drafting of this important report was particularly notable. His work in\u000d\u000a      developing the ethical considerations, and especially in addressing issues\u000d\u000a      around identity in relation to genetic therapies, formed a very\u000d\u000a      substantial part of the arguments that sit at the heart of the report. His\u000d\u000a      further contribution in applying these ethical discussions to the novel\u000d\u000a      case of potential treatments for mitochondrial disorders was also critical\u000d\u000a      to the success of this report\" [8]. Lewens presented results of that\u000d\u000a      report at a launch event in the Palace of Westminster (June 2012), and at\u000d\u000a      the Trilateral Meeting of the French, German and UK National Ethics\u000d\u000a      Committees (November 2012). The report has been discussed in a recent\u000d\u000a      (March 2013) Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) report\u000d\u000a      on Preventing Mitochondrial Disease [9]. The Nuffield Council's\u000d\u000a      conclusions regarding the ethical permissibility of mitochondrial\u000d\u000a      donation, the recommendation that gamete donors need not be mandatorily\u000d\u000a      identifiable to children in this particular context, and the requirement\u000d\u000a      of follow-up studies, were all echoed in the (March 2013) advice to\u000d\u000a      Ministers from the HFEA [10].

In 2002 he became a University Lecturer, was promoted to\u000d\u000a      Senior Lecturer in 2006, to Reader in 2010 and now to a Professorship in\u000d\u000a      the Department from this October. Since 2000 he has undertaken a series of\u000d\u000a      innovative studies of the concepts of risk, trust and their related roles\u000d\u000a      in discussions of bioethics and technology policy. Most of this work was\u000d\u000a      conducted by Lewens working alone, but some elements of the work have\u000d\u000a      involved substantial contributions from others. The most notable example\u000d\u000a      of this collaborative work was the co-authored report on The Universal\u000d\u000a      Ethical Code for Scientists and the `Crisis of Trust in Science' (2010),\u000d\u000a      which Tim Lewens wrote with Dr Stephen John, also of HPS. This piece of\u000d\u000a      novel research, which argued against the very idea of a generic crisis of\u000d\u000a      trust in science, and instead urged focus on more specific ways in which\u000d\u000a      scientific evidence is used within policy formation, was commissioned as\u000d\u000a      part of the government's Science in Society Programme review of `Science\u000d\u000a      and Trust' in 2009-10.\u000d\u000a    In broad terms, Lewens' work on risk (e.g. Lewens 2007a, 2008) aimed to\u000d\u000a      sketch a defensible version of the precautionary principle, and also to\u000d\u000a      clarify the ethical status of various forms of risk cost-benefit analysis.\u000d\u000a      His work in bioethics has assessed issues relating to modern\u000d\u000a      biotechnology, risk and identity (e.g. Lewens 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012). He\u000d\u000a      has criticised fashionable appeals to notions of human nature as they are\u000d\u000a      often applied to debates over the introduction of new and potentially\u000d\u000a      risky biotechnologies (Lewens 2012), arguing that biology grounds only\u000d\u000a      very permissive conceptions of human nature, which cannot be used to\u000d\u000a      justify conservative opposition to human enhancement. He has also been a\u000d\u000a      consistent opponent of `genetic exceptionalism', whereby genetic\u000d\u000a      technologies are singled out for specific forms of regulatory oversight or\u000d\u000a      ethical censure (e.g. Lewens 2002, 2004, 2009). In this work Lewens casts\u000d\u000a      doubt on the basic ethical justification for wholesale bans on\u000d\u000a      modifications to the `germ-line', for example, in a manner which has\u000d\u000a      consequences for the ethical permissibility of very new techniques for\u000d\u000a      modification of mitochondrial genomes. In all cases, Lewens' work is\u000d\u000a      grounded in appeals to work in modern biology, as well as to the broader\u000d\u000a      historical contexts of these debates. He has consistently aimed to link\u000d\u000a      this work to issues of political concern, as exemplified by his work on\u000d\u000a      altruism and the political use of images of human nature in his (2007b)\u000d\u000a      Darwin. This book distinguished various important notions of altruism, and\u000d\u000a      clarified their relationship to moral images of human nature.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18013","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has had impact on the development of museum displays and\u000a      interpretation of the\u000a      material culture and instrumentation of the period of the Scientific\u000a      Revolution and the\u000a      Enlightenment.

The senior curator and head of science and technology at the\u000a      Museum states that\u000a      Schaffer's research on early modern instruments in the physical sciences\u000a      `has had an important\u000a      influence' on these projects [5.3]. A direct output of the research was a\u000a      JISC programme to release\u000a      the entire manuscript archive of the Board in a digitized edition of more\u000a      than 65000 images\u000a      available online through free public access, together with links through\u000a      to images and\u000a      documentation of each instrument and measurement device mentioned in the\u000a      archive, released\u000a      worldwide in July 2013. This material is officially described as `a\u000a      wonderful resource for research\u000a      and education in many spheres' and of very wide `public interest' [5.4].\u000a      Schaffer's research project\u000a      has provided selection, thematic commentaries, and much of the metadata of\u000a      the JISC digital\u000a      edition to aid the preservation of extremely fragile and sensitive papers.\u000a      Schaffer's research has\u000a      attracted significant press coverage of the digitized longitude archive\u000a      [5.5] and the production of a\u000a      BBC audio slideshow [5.6].\u000a    This research has also underpinned programming in BBC radio interviews\u000a      with Schaffer about the\u000a      interpretation of the material culture of early modern and eighteenth\u000a      century sciences.

This research project started in 1997-98. Public support for the\u000a      research was gained from\u000a      the British Academy, Leverhulme Trust, and Arts and Humanities Research\u000a      Council (including a\u000a      major Research Grant in 2010-14 with Schaffer as principal investigator to\u000a      study the development\u000a      of instruments and archives of the Board of Longitude). The research\u000a      included the detailed\u000a      analysis of the pathways of production, distribution and use of a range of\u000a      accurate mechanisms in\u000a      astronomical and experimental sciences between the late seventeenth and\u000a      early nineteenth\u000a      centuries. Three sets of devices provided the focus of this geographical\u000a      and commercial study: (a)\u000a      automatic machinery both as simulacra of human activity (Schaffer 1999)\u000a      and as recording devices\u000a      that are used to capture and display variables that require permanent and\u000a      vigilant observation\u000a      (Schaffer 2012); (b) optical devices deployed in land based surveys for\u000a      cadastral and economic\u000a      purposes and in astronomical and marine surveys of position (Schaffer\u000a      2009; Schaffer 2012); (c)\u000a      analytical instruments to assay the quality and properties of a range of\u000a      commodities, including\u000a      precious metals and chemical products, whose distribution and consumption\u000a      was decisive for the\u000a      development of global mercantile and colonial systems (Schaffer 2002;\u000a      Schaffer 2005). The project\u000a      has drawn on many the major museum collections of scientific instruments,\u000a      notably those at the\u000a      National Maritime Museum, the Science Museum London, and the Whipple\u000a      Museum Cambridge.\u000a      Evidence from trade cards, from manuscript logs, correspondence and\u000a      reports to the metropolis,\u000a      was combined with statements based on machine and instrument use in the\u000a      range of printed\u000a      formats that travellers, savants and entrepreneurs then published.\u000a      Important in this approach has\u000a      been an attention to the fundamental aspects of the lives of instruments\u000a      and machines, since it has\u000a      been shown that none of these devices was so weak that its meaning was\u000a      entirely dictated by the\u000a      particular setting of its use, nor so robust that its use stayed constant\u000a      across all these settings.\u000a      Thus, an approach drawn from historical geography has been followed, in\u000a      which the model of\u000a      enlightened sciences, based on precision design and accurate observation,\u000a      were complemented\u000a      by a cartography of the many sites at which these machines were put to use\u000a      (Schaffer 2009;\u000a      Schaffer 2009a). A complementary aspect of the research has been the study\u000a      of the manifold\u000a      interactions between the design of new self-acting machines in the epoch\u000a      of industrialisation,\u000a      developments in clockwork, and the long career of automata and androids in\u000a      the eighteenth\u000a      century (Schaffer 1999). The research has therefore generated important\u000a      results connecting the\u000a      practice of enlightened sciences worldwide, including significant sites\u000a      such as southern and\u000a      eastern Asia and the south Pacific with the use of the material culture of\u000a      these sciences as objects\u000a      of trade, of status and of control.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18036","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Professor Smith's paper at the Philosophy and Wine conference has\u000a      had ongoing impact from\u000a      2004 to the present.

He organised an\u000a      international conference to present his research at the School of Advanced\u000a      Study, University of\u000a      London, 3rd December 2004. The conference,`Philosophy and\u000a      Wine', in which philosophers,\u000a      winemakers, critics and other wine professionals participated, launched a\u000a      new field of\u000a      interdisciplinary research, the Philosophy of Wine.\u000a    Smith's conference paper `The Objectivity of Tastes and Tasting' evoked a\u000a      strong and\u000a      favourable response from the wine industry and from several wine critics\u000a      (including Jancis\u000a      Robinson). The paper rejects the common assumption that tastes are just\u000a      sensations: it\u000a      distinguishes the subjective experience of tasting from the objective\u000a      tastes encountered in a\u000a      wine. It argues that tasting is a complex experience, and that we can\u000a      learn to assess the\u000a      perceptible qualities of a wine by distinguishing perception of objective\u000a      flavour properties from\u000a      personal preferences. This paper, along with others presented at the\u000a      conference Questions of\u000a        Taste: the Philosophy of Wine, was published in an Oxford University\u000a      Press volume and by\u000a      Signal books, thanks to these publishers inviting Smith to produce a book\u000a      based on the\u000a      conference (Ref 1). The volume was favourably reviewed in wine magazines\u000a      and newspapers\u000a      including the TLS (June 2007) and The New York Times\u000a      (September 2007), and it featured\u000a      among Tim Akin's top five wine books of the year in The Observer\u000a      (Dec 2007). Favourable\u000a      reviews also appeared in two academic journals&#8212;The British Journal of\u000a        Aesthetics (2008) and\u000a        Mind (2009). Smith's defence of the objectivity of taste has been\u000a      picked up by others: it was the\u000a      subject of chapter 4 of Cain Todd's The Philosophy of Wine\u000a      (Ashgate 2011), and of articles in\u000a      the British Journal of Aesthetics 2012, and in The Aesthetics\u000a        of Wine, eds. D.Burnham and\u000a      O.Shilleas (Wiley 2012).\u000a    As Director of the Institute of Philosophy, seconded from Birkbeck since\u000a      2008, Smith continued\u000a      to develop his research in this area, working closely with psychologists\u000a      and neuroscientists on\u000a      how interactions between our senses influence flavour perception. He was\u000a      an invited participant\u000a      in international conferences of professional chemists and oenologists\u000a      working in the wine\u000a      industry, Wine Active Compounds, in Beaune in 2008 and in 2011;\u000a      and he contributed to the\u000a      scientific proceedings of both conference (Refs 2 and 3).\u000a    In 2009 Smith founded the Centre for the Study of the Senses (CenSes) at\u000a      the Institute of\u000a      Philosophy with a view to promoting innovative and collaborative research\u000a      between\u000a      philosophers, psychologists and neuroscientists. In 2012, he contributed\u000a      to a scientific paper in\u000a      the journal Food Quality and Preference, and he published a paper\u000a      in Nature (Ref 4). He has\u000a      contributed an article on `Philosophical Perspectives on Taste' for The\u000a        Encyclopaedia of Mind\u000a      (Sage January 2013). With co-authors Charles Spence and Mailika Auvray, he\u000a      has contributed a\u000a      paper `Confusing Tastes and Flavours' to Perception and its Modalities,\u000a      and is sole author of a\u000a      paper `The Chemical Senses' in The Oxford Handbook of Perception\u000a      (both OUP forthcoming).\u000a    Smith was awarded a British Academy Latin American-Caribbean Link Grant\u000a      to run two\u000a      workshops on `Sensory Exploration and Evaluation of Flavour' in Bogota\u000a      (attended by 300\u000a      delegates and streamed to a further 3000 internationally) and London\u000a      (2010-12).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18136","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council","British Academy","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research into the history of evolution in Cambridge has had a\u000d\u000a      profound impact on public understanding of science as a cooperative,\u000d\u000a      collaborative enterprise involving men and women from different\u000d\u000a      backgrounds. Several hundred articles have appeared in print, from the New\u000a        York Times and the Guardian to the Frankfurter\u000d\u000a        Allegmeine Zeitung and the Sun [5.4, 5.6]. Professor\u000d\u000a      Secord, Dr Pearn, Dr White and other members of the Darwin Correspondence\u000d\u000a      Project staff feature regularly on television and radio programmes in many\u000d\u000a      different countries. In the Darwin bicentennial year of 2009, in Britain\u000d\u000a      these included In Our Time, Women's Hour, the Today Programme, Bang Goes\u000d\u000a      the Theory, and The Story of Science [5.3, 5.5]. The Project's research is\u000d\u000a      consulted by documentary producers and feature filmmakers, and has served\u000d\u000a      as the basis for several dramas. For example, the major television\u000d\u000a      dramatization `Darwin's Darkest Hour', was produced in by National\u000d\u000a      Geographic (in association with NOVA) with using extensive material from\u000d\u000a      the Correspondence Project. In 2008 the Project commissioned the\u000d\u000a      playwright Craig Baxter to write Re:design, based on the\u000d\u000a      correspondence between Darwin and the American botanist Asa Gray. This has\u000d\u000a      been widely performed on both sides of the Atlantic, having been\u000d\u000a      translated into Danish, German, Spanish and Turkish; performances in all\u000d\u000a      these languages occurred during 2009 [5.1].\u000d\u000a    Cambridge has a strong record of outreach relating to the history of\u000d\u000a      evolution and the Darwin bicentenary offered a unique opportunity to build\u000d\u000a      on this. Two popular selections of letters were issued, as well as an\u000d\u000a      illustrated version of the complete letters relating to the Beagle\u000d\u000a      voyage, which sold over 4,500 copies. A major exhibition [3.2] was mounted\u000d\u000a      in the University Library in Cambridge, which attracted a record of over\u000d\u000a      22,000 visitors; a smaller exhibition about Darwin's public reputation was\u000d\u000a      staged in the Whipple Museum of the History of Science. In 2012 the Darwin\u000d\u000a      Project participated in a further exhibition in the University Library,\u000d\u000a      `Books and Babies: Communicating Reproduction'. As chair of the science\u000d\u000a      programme at the Cambridge 2009 Darwin Festival, Professor Secord ensured\u000d\u000a      that themes from history and philosophy became a feature of this public\u000d\u000a      meeting, which attracted 1500 participants from 39 countries; every major\u000d\u000a      session began with a reading from a Darwin letter. There have been over\u000d\u000a      880,000 viewings of the Festival recordings. In January 2009 he also spoke\u000d\u000a      on his research on `Global Darwin' in the Darwin College public lecture\u000d\u000a      series. This hour-long lecture [5.5] has been downloaded over 23,000\u000d\u000a      times.\u000d\u000a    The Darwin Online Project has had a transformative effect at all levels\u000d\u000a      of public understanding across the world, with several hundred million\u000d\u000a      hits since 2008 [5.4]. In a continuing process of providing fresh\u000d\u000a      materials to a wide public, this project has made clearly sourced editions\u000d\u000a      of Darwin's published writings and manuscripts (including those in the\u000d\u000a      University Library at Cambridge) freely available for the first time. The\u000d\u000a      materials have substantially improved the quality of discussion about\u000d\u000a      Darwin and evolution on the internet and in schools.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Cultural Life\u000d\u000a    Professor Secord's approach, with its stress on the public audiences and\u000d\u000a      wider contexts of Darwin and Darwinism, was fundamental to a major\u000d\u000a      exhibition held by the Fitzwilliam Museum and the Yale Center for British\u000d\u000a      Art staged in 2009, `Endless Forms: Darwin, Natural Science and the Visual\u000d\u000a      Arts'. He was instrumental in the discussions that led to the exhibition\u000d\u000a      and was appointed as its chief consultant on the history of science,\u000d\u000a      advising the curators at every stage. He contributed a podcast (on his\u000d\u000a      research [5.12] and gave several public lectures and gallery tours.\u000d\u000a      Attracting a record-breaking 93,000 visitors to the Fitzwilliam, including\u000d\u000a      many from around the world, `Endless Forms' was named Exhibition of the\u000d\u000a      Year by Apollo magazine, and its catalogue [5.8] won the Berger\u000d\u000a      Prize for the best book in British art history of the year. As the\u000d\u000a      curators said, `We share the honour with contributing authors, colleagues\u000d\u000a      at the Yale Center for British Art and especially with the book's\u000d\u000a      scientific advisor Professor James Secord'.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Education\u000d\u000a    During the past three years, the Darwin Correspondence Project has\u000d\u000a      initiated a major programme of outreach in schools and colleges. In part,\u000d\u000a      this builds on earlier experiences, including the provision of major\u000d\u000a      online resources relating to evolution and religion, and a `Write a Letter\u000d\u000a      to Darwin' programme in 2009 involving use of the online correspondence\u000d\u000a      and sponsored by the University of Exeter and South West Schools. The\u000d\u000a      current Cambridge-based initiative provides full downloadable packages\u000d\u000a      available for key stages 3 and 4 and A\/AS level in Science, English, and\u000d\u000a      History. The material has been developed through close consultation with\u000d\u000a      teachers and has been piloted by Sally Stafford, the Project's full-time\u000d\u000a      education officer from 2010 to 2013, in selected UK schools. As the\u000d\u000a      materials were released in May 2013 the scale of classroom use is not yet\u000d\u000a      available, but external evaluation [5.10] has confirmed that students and\u000d\u000a      teachers found the letters revealed the human side of science, developed\u000d\u000a      skills in writing, experimenting and asking questions, and in\u000d\u000a      understanding the role of collaboration and debate in science. A further\u000d\u000a      body of materials relating to university teaching about Darwin, gender and\u000d\u000a      women was released in August 2013 [5.7, 5.9], with coverage in national\u000d\u000a      newspapers and on national TV news.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study focuses on the impact of research carried out at the\u000d\u000a      University of Cambridge into the history of evolution by Professor James\u000d\u000a      Secord and co-workers, notably the impact of two research programmes: the\u000d\u000a      Darwin Correspondence Project and Darwin Online. These projects have\u000d\u000a      contributed to a substantial reorientation of public discourse on the\u000d\u000a      history of evolution. The impact has been achieved through web resources;\u000d\u000a      museum and library exhibitions; teaching materials for schools and\u000d\u000a      universities; and radio and television programmes. These outputs have\u000d\u000a      encouraged public understanding of the range of contributors to science,\u000d\u000a      including women; an awareness of the diversity of positions in the\u000d\u000a      evolutionary debate; and an appreciation of the complex relations between\u000d\u000a      evolutionary science and faith.

His book, Victorian\u000a        Sensation (2000), is a reinterpretation of the evolutionary\u000d\u000a      controversies, focused on the publication and reception of the anonymous\u000d\u000a      best-seller Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844),\u000d\u000a      which was written by the Edinburgh publisher and author, Robert Chambers.\u000d\u000a      It provides a fresh understanding of the evolutionary debates,\u000d\u000a      particularly in relation to religion, in the period before publication of\u000d\u000a      the Origin of Species; it also is the most thorough study of the\u000d\u000a      reading and reception of a single book (other than the Bible) ever\u000d\u000a      undertaken. The wider consequences of an approach to history of science\u000d\u000a      based on communication are drawn out in the widely cited Secord (2004).\u000d\u000a      This work on evolution has also involved making sound texts of the key\u000d\u000a      works available with introductions, including works by Charles Lyell,\u000d\u000a      Chambers and Darwin.\u000d\u000a    Since 2006 Professor Secord has been Director of the Darwin\u000d\u000a      Correspondence Project (founded in 1974), which is transcribing, editing\u000d\u000a      and footnoting all the 15,000 letters to and from Darwin at the highest\u000d\u000a      academic standards. This currently involves a team of seven editors, as\u000d\u000a      well as associated staff involved in outreach and provision of online\u000d\u000a      resources. The letters are published as books by Cambridge University\u000d\u000a      Press and are also available freely on the web. Professor Secord was also\u000d\u000a      the Principal Investigator for the Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online\u000d\u000a      project, which has made available first editions of all of Darwin's works\u000d\u000a      (and images of many manuscripts) online for free. The project was directed\u000d\u000a      by Dr John van Wyhe, a postdoctoral fellow at Cambridge from 2005 to 2009.\u000d\u000a      As one of the referees wrote in 2009 on the conclusion of the initial\u000d\u000a      funding award, `This is a resource closely linked to top-level scholarly\u000d\u000a      research, of clearly international significance, and meeting all the key\u000d\u000a      objectives of AHRC funding, including knowledge transfer. It is a matter\u000d\u000a      for celebration that the AHRC has supported this project.'\u000d\u000a    The research has had three aims in contributing to public discussions of\u000d\u000a      the evolutionary controversies of the nineteenth century. The first has\u000d\u000a      been to reorient the history of evolution before publication of On the\u000d\u000a        Origin of Species. The second is to place the work of Charles Darwin\u000d\u000a      in this broader setting, by making available his correspondence and other\u000d\u000a      writings available to a wide audience. The third is to use these sources\u000d\u000a      to provide new understandings of the role of evolutionary discussion in\u000d\u000a      the public sphere and as a global phenomenon. Correspondence provides a\u000d\u000a      model in which relations between different religious and cultural groups\u000d\u000a      can be seen in terms of exchange and interaction, rather than as\u000d\u000a      confrontation.\u000d\u000a    The editorial research on Darwin has led to an extensive range of\u000d\u000a      associated academic outcomes, particularly in relation to the Descent\u000d\u000a        of Man (1871), The Expression of the Emotions (1872) and the\u000d\u000a      international debates sparked by these works. This has included\u000d\u000a      publications by Project staff on Darwin's attitudes towards the emotions,\u000d\u000a      on the nature of correspondence as a literary genre (White 2007, 2008),\u000d\u000a      and extensive original material on the website by Dr Sophie Defrance\u000d\u000a      (Research Associate, 2010-13), Dr Philippa Hardman (Research Associate,\u000d\u000a      2010-13), Dr Alison Pearn (Associate Director and Editor, 1996-) and Dr\u000d\u000a      Paul White (Associate Editor, 1997-) relating to gender, human nature and\u000d\u000a      religion. A significant focus of the underpinning work on the letters has\u000d\u000a      been the global reception of evolutionary theory and its relation to\u000d\u000a      empire and ideologies of progress in the nineteenth century (Secord 2008,\u000d\u000a      Secord 2009), including collaboration with Chinese colleagues in a grant\u000d\u000a      from the British Council, and participation in conferences in Europe,\u000d\u000a      Africa, Asia and North America.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18762","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Type of impact: The impact is change to society and\u000d\u000a        public policy in relation to awareness, policy and practice\u000d\u000a      on the part of organisations with national and international\u000d\u000a      responsibilities.

The research-to-impact trails outlined\u000d\u000a      here demonstrate that the impact is centrally founded on Chadwick's\u000d\u000a          research.

The project\u000d\u000a      monitors the effect of open consent on recruitment, as outlined in the\u000d\u000a      team's 2008 paper.3-2 Such monitoring aligns with\u000d\u000a     Chadwick's position that the value impact of bio-technology is far from\u000d\u000a      static. In 2012, PGP Canada adopted open consent, with built-in\u000d\u000a      three-monthly monitorings of the consequences, positive and negative, of\u000d\u000a      donation.5-2 This step reflects Chadwick's articulation of the\u000d\u000a      need to surface the consequences of biobanking in order to inform future\u000d\u000a      decision-making.3-5 Open consent is a social experiment,\u000d\u000a      testing the power of the communitarian turn in bioethics3-5 by\u000d\u000a      relying on the willingness of donors to give DNA in full knowledge of the\u000d\u000a      potential risks.3-2 Are humans that altruistic, and will they\u000d\u000a      remain so when more is known about the reality of the hypothetical risks?\u000d\u000a      The Personal Genome Projects (PGP) in the US and Canada are gathering data\u000d\u000a      from participants to find out.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    b) The Wellcome Trust and NIH funded Human Heredity and Health Africa\u000d\u000a      (H3Africa) Consortium facilitates \"a contemporary research approach to the\u000d\u000a      study of genomics and environmental determinants of common diseases with\u000d\u000a      the goal of improving the health of African populations\" (http:\/\/www.h3africa.org\/).\u000d\u000a      In 2013, H3Africa developed guidelines for `informed consent' that bear\u000d\u000a      many hallmarks of open consent, for use in DNA data collection across\u000d\u000a      projects in Africa.5-3 They include not only wordings for\u000d\u000a      consent forms, but explanations of the underlying issues, and advice on\u000d\u000a      how to ensure the generalised material is appropriate to the local context\u000d\u000a      (e.g.p.8). Chadwick, a member of the Expert Committee,5-4\u000d\u000a      presented the case for open consent at the H3Africa inaugural conference5-5\u000d\u000a\u0009  and is acknowledged (p.4) as a primary advisor on the draft. The\u000d\u000a      text reflects her case3-3 that while consent practices need to\u000d\u000a      be harmonised, to protect vulnerable populations, they must be sensitive\u000d\u000a      to local conditions and beliefs, without undermining equity or veracity\u000d\u000a      (e.g. p.18).\u000d\u000a    Impact on the biobanks debate\u000d\u000a    c) As a member of the UN Panel of Eminent Experts on Ethics in Food and\u000d\u000a      Agriculture, Chadwick contributed research ideas3-4 to a\u000d\u000a      report on the future of global food security, authoring the section on\u000d\u000a      nutrigenomics5-6 (p.40-44). It raises asks whether ngx might:\u000d\u000a      distract from the right to food; contribute to or distract from public\u000d\u000a      health goals; benefit only selected populations; and create challenges for\u000d\u000a      cultural difference, and it asks what an ethically robust ngx policy\u000d\u000a      should look like.\u000d\u000a    d) Two reports for the Nuffield Council on Bioethics (NCB) drew on\u000d\u000a      Chadwick's research. The NCB promotes discussion of ethical issues arising\u000d\u000a      from biological and medical research, and publishes recommendations on\u000d\u000a      policy. One report was an independent evaluation of solidarity as a\u000d\u000a      concept in bioethics (2011).5-7 At two workshops, Chadwick\u000d\u000a      explained and debated solidarity and open consent, informing the report's\u000d\u000a      emerging account of the `communitarian turn' in bioethics.\u000d\u000a    Addressing the ownership of information and the notion of open consent\u000d\u000a      (chap 6), veracity as a driving force is acknowledged as a core claim of\u000d\u000a      the 2008 paper.3-1 The authors propose an approach \"based on\u000d\u000a      the core assumption that when individuals decide to participate in\u000d\u000a      biobank-based research, they are willing to accept the possibility that\u000d\u000a      [a] certain level of costs may need to be carried by them for the sake of\u000d\u000a      communal benefit\"5-7 They cite the PGP (see a),\u000d\u000a      as a model for their recommended practices (p.61). The NCB 2012 report on\u000d\u000a      Emerging Biotechnologies5-8 also reflects and\u000d\u000a      acknowledges Chadwick's research. Of the principles of public solidarity,\u000d\u000a      the report states: \"This new orientation is towards a notion of the public\u000d\u000a      good rather than&#8212;and distinct from&#8212;the concern for negotiation between\u000d\u000a      individual interests engaged by bioethical questions\"5-8\u000d\u000a      (p.62).\u000d\u000a    Hugh Whittall, Director of NCB since 2007, states: \"The Council's work on\u000d\u000a      both publications to which Professor Chadwick has contributed has been\u000d\u000a      influential in promoting the principle of solidarity in bioethics and in\u000d\u000a      developing it as an underpinning framework for policy.\" He adds,\u000d\u000a      \"Especially useful was her research into the way concepts of solidarity\u000d\u000a      have changed in the context of modern genetics, and her interest in\u000d\u000a      openness and honesty with those donating to biobanks.\"5-9 e)\u000d\u000a      Chadwick chaired a working group to draft a White Paper for the Human\u000d\u000a      Genome Organisation (HUGO), 2013.5-10 It explores issues\u000d\u000a      arising from relinquishing confidentiality. Acknowledging open consent in\u000d\u000a      the PGP's as socially beneficial, it yet notes: \"privacy and\u000d\u000a      confidentially still have a role in genetic data processing and storage,\"\u000d\u000a      echoing Chadwick's position that the ethical entailments of consent\u000d\u000a      remain, at this time of rapid development in biotechnology, conflicting\u000d\u000a      and unresolved.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    [Key: Bold: text from REF guidelines; Bold italic\/italic:\u000d\u000a      emphasis; Superscript: references in sections 3 and 5]\u000d\u000a    Research by Chadwick has influenced research protocols and policies\u000d\u000a      regarding the ethical consequences of collecting DNA for research. Her\u000d\u000a      impact is most visible in the Personal Genome Project, and the work of the\u000d\u000a      Nuffield Council on Bioethics, UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, Human\u000d\u000a      Genome Project and H3Africa. Her contributions to discussions and\u000d\u000a      documents resulted in changes to how consent is gained from DNA donors. In\u000d\u000a      particular, the changes address important issues that she raised regarding\u000d\u000a      the practicality and acceptability of the undertakings made in current\u000d\u000a      consent protocols about confidentiality and the future use of data.\u000d\u000a      Chadwick's underpinning research claims relate to the fact that genetic\u000d\u000a      information, and the attendant genetic technology, are derived from, and\u000d\u000a      significant to, populations as a whole. She maintains that\u000d\u000a      biotechnological advances are changing our ethical values, particularly\u000d\u000a      regarding conflicts between personal interests and large-group needs. For\u000d\u000a      her, practical ethics cannot apply normative ethical concepts and theories\u000d\u000a      arising from abstract philosophical reasoning. Rather, the conceptual and\u000d\u000a      theoretical structures themselves must be developed through philosophical\u000d\u000a      engagement with the scientific details of the project. Her collaboration\u000d\u000a      with bodies responsible for the protocols of consent reflects a\u000d\u000a      `bottom-up' moral philosophy rather than the traditional `top-down'\u000d\u000a      theory-driven approach.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Cardiff University\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Cardiff University","InstitutionName":"Cardiff University","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Wales","UKPRN":10007814}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    All publications are available from the HEI.\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

Her research responded\u000d\u000a      to the ethical concerns raised by fast technological and aspirational\u000d\u000a      change in biotechnology, triggered by the first human genome sequences in\u000d\u000a      2003 and 2007, and took up the challenge raised in Nature Genetics\u000d\u000a      28: 297f in 2001, to \"provide pragmatic, moral guidance to all that are\u000d\u000a      affected by genomics\" by \"defining a new bioethics that promises real\u000d\u000a      world solutions to real world problems.\"\u000d\u000a    a. Value impact. How changes in our lives impact on our\u000d\u000a      values (`value impact') is nowhere more evident than in biotechnology.\u000d\u000a      Chadwick argues: \"we may find that principles that have worked very well\u000d\u000a      in specific contexts in the past are not simply transferable.\"3-5\u000d\u000a      In 2006-13, Chadwick tracked value impact (her own term, Chadwick 1999, Health,\u000d\u000a        Risk &amp; Society 1,3: 294), in the wake of new possibilities and\u000d\u000a      expectations. She articulated contradictions that cannot be easily\u000d\u000a      resolved: the individual vs the community;3-5 autonomy vs\u000d\u000a      responsibility;3-4 inclusion\/equity vs pragmatism and profit;3-1\u000d\u000a\u0009confidentiality vs personalised feedback;3-1,3-4\u000d\u000a      caution vs veracity;3-2 intercultural harmonisation vs\u000d\u000a      standardisation.3-3 By recognising the relevance of the\u000d\u000a      `communitarian turn' in bioethics to these issues, Chadwick articulated a\u000d\u000a      distinctive and compelling approach to the value impact of biotechnology,3-1,3-5\u000d\u000a      whereby the needs of a wider group (family, ethnic group, world-wide\u000d\u000a      population) take precedence over personal interests. Participating in\u000d\u000a      medical research has often entailed altruism, in that the findings will\u000d\u000a      come too late to help the donor, but donations to DNA bio- banks raise the\u000d\u000a      stakes on personal costs because of the many potential long term risks of\u000d\u000a      donation (see d below). With reference to her research in\u000d\u000a      three domains: pharmacogenomics,3-1 medical research3-2,3-3,3-5\u000d\u000a      and nutrigenomics,3-4 she demonstrated \"how the applicability\u000d\u000a      of traditional ethical frameworks ... is coming under challenge ...\u000d\u000a      Justice, privacy, informed consent, and autonomy: all these are subject to\u000d\u000a      reconstrual in the light of developments in genetics\"3-1\u000d\u000a      (p.787-8).\u000d\u000a    b. The effect of personalisation on autonomy. Genome\u000d\u000a      sequencing enables the personalisation of drug therapies\u000d\u000a      (pharmacogenomics, `pgx') and dietary advice (nutrigenomics, `ngx').\u000d\u000a      Chadwick has contributed three arguments in the ethical debate. (1) Pgx\u000d\u000a      risks creating two-tier medicine. `Orphan' populations will emerge: those\u000d\u000a      unable to afford personalised medicine, and the minorities whose genetic\u000d\u000a      profile is not suitable for drugs developed, for reasons of profit, only\u000d\u000a      to suit the majority.3-1 (2) The promise of `tailored' medicine\u000d\u000a      or nutritional advice understates the continued role of population\u000d\u000a      statistics to determine the most likely profile of the individual.3-4\u000d\u000a      In practice, an individual still might not receive the optimum treatment\u000d\u000a      because the statistics conceal finer points of difference or generalise\u000d\u000a      inappropriately.3-1 (3) Personalised feedback may extend beyond\u000d\u000a      what the individual wishes to know. Ethical practices should include a\u000d\u000a      \"right not to know\" about, say, \"a late onset disorder for which there was\u000d\u000a      no effective treatment.\"3-1\u000d\u000a    Chadwick3-1,3-5argues that the entire foundation of\u000d\u000a      biomedical ethics, \"primarily concerned with protecting the interests of\u000d\u000a      individuals in medical contexts,\" is undermined by personalisation.\u000d\u000a      Personalisation \"is associated not only with the rhetoric of `choice' (and\u000d\u000a      autonomy), but also with facilitating more individual responsibility for\u000d\u000a      health\".3-1 Dietary advice may seem to enable what she terms\u000d\u000a      `thin' individual autonomy: factual information is provided, for free\u000d\u000a      choice of action. However, there is a continuum from smoking advice, where\u000d\u000a      others can be caused harm by one's actions, to binge eating, which can\u000d\u000a      cost the health service money. Thus, she argues that the vision of ngx\u000d\u000a      presented in the UK Dept of Health white paper `Choosing Health' (2005)\u000d\u000a      entails `thick' autonomy: there is an agenda of responsibility, even\u000d\u000a      though the rhetoric is still one of choice. \"[T]here is a barely hidden\u000d\u000a      assumption that people given information will make certain sorts of\u000d\u000a      choices.\"\u000d\u000a    c. Harmonisation vs standardisation. Chadwick argues that,\u000d\u000a      as many biobanks are international, harmonised or standardised ethical\u000d\u000a      procedures are needed so that data collected under tight control in one\u000d\u000a      place is not misused under laxer controls in another. Chadwick &amp;\u000d\u000a      Strange3-3 point out that some existing policies are\u000d\u000a      culture-centric in their assumptions about the relative importance of\u000d\u000a      individual and group interests. Yet cultural differences make it difficult\u000d\u000a      to have a single approach: \"the harmonisation of ethics may be better\u000d\u000a      served by establishing broad universal foundations that allow for diverse\u000d\u000a      interpretations rather than many specific guidelines or principles.\"3-3\u000d\u000a      This idea is put into practice in policy documents such as the H3Africa\u000d\u000a      ethics guidelines (see section 4).\u000d\u000a    d. Veracity and open access. For Chadwick, a major ethical\u000d\u000a      issue is lack of transparency about the possible future uses of data, and\u000d\u000a      the potential risks for the donor. This led her to examine the potential\u000d\u000a      for greater openness, or veracity. In an agenda-setting piece in Nature\u000d\u000a        Genetics 20083-2 Chadwick and her co-authors observe\u000d\u000a      that, with genetic data, \"the guarantee of absolute privacy and\u000d\u000a      confidentiality is not a promise that medical and scientific researchers\u000d\u000a      can deliver any longer.\" They argue that \"the reality of the new genetics\u000d\u000a      and genomics urges us to abandon the traditional concept of medical\u000d\u000a      confidentiality\" and \"new models are needed to offer robust moral guidance\u000d\u000a      while keeping the reality of a dynamic science in mind.\" Cyber-attack,\u000d\u000a      data mismanagement, and, particularly, unforeseen new technological\u000d\u000a      capabilities, are a \"real threat to privacy.\"3-5 The key\u000d\u000a      question raised is whether it is ethical to reiterate and strengthen\u000d\u000a      current promises of privacy and confidentiality, without knowing if they\u000d\u000a      are actually robust. DNA is not like other kinds of data. Even if the\u000d\u000a      donor's name and address are not collected, information from a sample\u000d\u000a      could be tracked back to the individual, e.g. through cross-comparison\u000d\u000a      with medical records, police databases, ngx data, genealogy data. And the\u000d\u000a      risks extend to family members, because of their shared DNA.\u000d\u000a    DNA samples are increasingly stored for long-term sharing. Ethics\u000d\u000a      protocols typically require an articulation of the future uses of the\u000d\u000a      data, but this is impossible, since many will involve techniques yet to be\u000d\u000a      invented. The default of returning to the donor for additional consent is\u000d\u000a      impractical and would hinder research progress. Various kinds of consent\u000d\u000a      (e.g. default with opt out, blanket, informed, broad) all have their\u000d\u000a      problems. Chadwick is co-author of a paper that introduces `open consent.'\u000d\u000a      Here, \"volunteers consent to unrestricted re-disclosure of data\u000d\u000a      originating from a con-fidential relationship, namely their health\u000d\u000a      records, and to unrestricted disclosure of information that emerges from\u000d\u000a      any future research on their genotype-phenotype data set, the information\u000d\u000a      content of which cannot be predicted. No promises of anonymity, privacy or\u000d\u000a      confidentiality are made.\"3-2 Open consent blows open the\u000d\u000a      hidden contrast between what donors typically expect and are promised, and\u000d\u000a      what is, or in future might, actually happen to their data. In open\u000d\u000a      consent, \"The leading moral principle is veracity&#8212;telling the truth&#8212;which\u000d\u000a      should precede autonomy\".3-2\u000d\u000a    Notwithstanding Chadwick's involvement with the development of open\u000d\u000a      consent practices, her role is less one of advocacy than balanced advice.\u000d\u000a      Open consent does not solve the confidentiality problem, only adopts\u000d\u000a      veracity in place of unsustainable promises. Through her practical work\u000d\u000a      with policy-makers (see section 4), Chadwick continues to surface\u000d\u000a      contradictions and ask new questions about what is ethically appropriate\u000d\u000a      for current and future biotechnological data collection.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18768","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research has been presented in numerous public forums\u000d\u000a      including non-academic books, public lectures and debates, radio\u000d\u000a      programmes, literary festivals, YouTube videos and podcasts, and\u000d\u000a      conferences for secondary school teachers (with information packs).

The assistant editor of Philosophy\u000a        Now writes, `We changed service provider a year or so ago, and since\u000d\u000a      that time have not been able to collect statistics for the downloads. I\u000d\u000a      can tell you that at the time of the change, Ken's Nietzsche show was the\u000d\u000a      most popular of all the shows, and had downloads of just under 25,000. The\u000d\u000a      Love one was almost as popular, with coming up to 20,000, and the Tragedy\u000d\u000a      one lagging only a bit behind with just under 15,000. Judging by the\u000d\u000a      patterns of growth at that time, it's reasonable to say that the stats\u000d\u000a      would have at least doubled by now, and probably more; so conservative\u000d\u000a      estimates would be 50,000, 40,000, and 30,000 respectively, but they may\u000d\u000a      now each be tens of thousands higher' (Source 5).

The research\u000d\u000a      aimed to explain nihilism and its destruction of our received notions of\u000d\u000a      values and the self, and to explore ways in which new life affirming\u000d\u000a      values might be constructed without reference to God. A key finding is\u000d\u000a      that nihilism is not to be glossed simply as an intellectual belief, such\u000d\u000a      as the belief that there are no ultimate values. More profoundly nihilism\u000d\u000a      involves an affective disposition by means of which drives that would\u000d\u000a      naturally be expressed in external actions are turned inwards and against\u000d\u000a      the self. A further key finding is that free will and selfhood are\u000d\u000a      achievements rather than a God-given birthright. The philosophical\u000d\u000a      literature tends to argue that either all humans have free will or none\u000d\u000a      do, and that every human has a self (or some such soul-analogue) or none\u000d\u000a      do. Nietzsche's work provides the basis for arguments to the conclusion\u000d\u000a      that both free will and having a genuine self are accomplishments achieved\u000d\u000a      by a select few. May subsequently went on to develop the idea that in the\u000d\u000a      modern world the one unquestioned value that has survived the onslaught of\u000d\u000a      nihilism is the value of love. In a thoroughly Nietzschean spirit he has\u000d\u000a      produced a genealogy of various concepts of love.\u000d\u000a    Gemes and May's research partnership dates back thirteen years. May's\u000d\u000a      first book on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's Ethics and his War on Morality\u000d\u000a      was published in 1999 and was the product of research he had undertaken as\u000d\u000a      a visiting fellow at Birkbeck over the previous three years. When Gemes\u000d\u000a      came to Birkbeck in 2000 he organized a series of weekly seminars with May\u000d\u000a      that discussed May's book chapter by chapter over a period of 8 weeks (Ref\u000d\u000a      5). Gemes and May subsequently met regularly at Birkbeck to discuss\u000d\u000a      various Nietzschean topics. They have participated together in numerous\u000d\u000a      conferences, three of which were organized by Gemes, including one that\u000d\u000a      led to a jointly edited OUP volume (Ref 1).\u000d\u000a    Professor Gemes, with particular reference to Nietzsche, has written a\u000d\u000a      series of articles (Refs 2, 3, 4) exploring the nature of nihilism, what\u000d\u000a      notions of the self and freedom we can construct without reference to an\u000d\u000a      immaterial soul, and how we might still find grounds for affirming life in\u000d\u000a      the absence of God and the soul. Professor May, with reference to\u000d\u000a      Nietzsche, has similarly explored the questions of nihilism, the self,\u000d\u000a      freedom and affirmation in articles (such as Ref 6), and additionally has\u000d\u000a      argued in his monograph (Ref 5) that, after the death of God, love remains\u000d\u000a      as the one unquestionable value.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19240","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    (i) The Impact of Signature\u000d\u000a    In October 2007 Frederick Burwick and James C. McKusick published Faustus:\u000a      From the German of Goethe.[i] This translation of Faustus\u000d\u000a    had originally been published anonymously, but their version carried the\u000d\u000a    bold subtitle Translated by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The last\u000d\u000a    chapter of their volume consisted of a `Stylometric Analysis of the Faust\u000d\u000a    Translations', using Professor Millican's Signature software to corroborate\u000d\u000a    the authors' claim that Coleridge was indeed the translator. From the\u000d\u000a    beginning of 2008 this provoked a major literary controversy that has\u000d\u000a    persisted ever since, in numerous websites and journals (including The\u000d\u000a      Times Literary Supplement and The Guardian). The society Friends\u000d\u000a      of Coleridge, which aims to foster interest in the life and works of\u000d\u000a    Coleridge and his circle, has a page on its website with links to the\u000d\u000a    various responses that they have received to Burwick's and McKusick's claim.[ii]\u000d\u000a    Secondly, very shortly before the US Election in November 2008, Professor\u000d\u000a      Millican was involved in a controversy about Barack Obama's autobiography\u000d\u000a      Dreams From my Father. Some Republican commentators advanced claims\u000d\u000a      that this autobiography was either written or ghost-written by Bill Ayers,\u000d\u000a      a Vietnam-era domestic terrorist. Author Jack Cashill claimed that his own\u000d\u000a      analysis of the book showed Ayers' writing style, and backed this up by\u000d\u000a      citing analyses by American researchers using Professor Millican's\u000d\u000a      Signature software. In 2008 Professor Millican himself was approached by\u000d\u000a      US Congressman Chris Cannon, who attempted to hire him to prove Ayers'\u000d\u000a      authorship using computer analysis. Professor Millican refused, after he\u000d\u000a      was not given any advance assurance that the results would be published\u000d\u000a      irrespective of their outcome. He later carried out his own research and\u000d\u000a      criticized the claim, saying that he could find no evidence for Cashill's\u000d\u000a      hypothesis. The story made the front page of the Sunday Times in\u000d\u000a      November 2008, after Professor Millican had written an article about the\u000d\u000a      affair for that paper.[iii]\u000d\u000a    Finally, in July 2013, The Sunday Times again referred to his\u000d\u000a      work, this time after he had used his software to corroborate a suspicion\u000d\u000a      raised by Richard Brooks, the arts editor of the New York Times,\u000d\u000a      that the supposedly debut novel The Cuckoo's Calling by Robert\u000d\u000a      Galbraith was in fact written by J.K. Rowling under a pseudonym.[iv]\u000d\u000a      Professor Millican noted that this novel was significantly closer in text\u000d\u000a      comparison to other work by Rowling &#8212; including her Harry Potter work &#8212;\u000d\u000a      than it was to other crime books. Rowling subsequently confessed that the\u000d\u000a      work was indeed hers and commented on her own website, `I hoped to keep\u000d\u000a      this secret a little longer.'\u000d\u000a    (ii) The Impact of Elizabeth and its Associated Research on Marketing\u000d\u000a    In August 2005 Professor Millican received an e-mail from Craig Kolb[v],\u000d\u000a      a business analyst with the company Ask Afrika. Kolb wanted to try to use\u000d\u000a      chatterbot technology in a marketing context, and had identified Professor\u000d\u000a      Millican's Elizabeth system as the most suitable for the purpose, owing to\u000d\u000a      its power, its control, and its flexibility. Working together, Millican\u000d\u000a      and Kolb developed a script that the latter then used to investigate South\u000d\u000a      African consumers' reasons for choosing their mobile phone network.\u000d\u000a      Exploiting the feedback from this exercise, they have in the last year\u000d\u000a      undertaken further work towards producing an online version of Elizabeth\u000d\u000a      capable of augmenting online surveys.\u000d\u000a    (iii) The Impact of Turtle and its Associated Research on Primary and\u000d\u000a        Secondary Education\u000d\u000a      Professor Millican's Turtle system is designed to enable beginning\u000d\u000a      students to script their own chatterbots and, in doing so, to learn about\u000d\u000a      artificial intelligence. This has led to his being involved in\u000d\u000a      consultation on Michael Gove's plans to develop the teaching of computer\u000d\u000a      science in schools, in place of the information and communication\u000d\u000a      technology that exists at present. Because of his philosophical interests,\u000d\u000a      Professor Millican was put in touch with Vanessa Pittard, who works at the\u000d\u000a      Department of Education and holds responsibility for the technology in\u000d\u000a      schools strategy and who is leading this initiative. He was subsequently\u000d\u000a      invited to participate in a conference organized by the National\u000d\u000a      Association of Advisors for Computers in Education, a community of\u000d\u000a      educators, technologists, and policy makers concerned with the role of\u000d\u000a      technology in advancing education: this conference took place in Easter\u000d\u000a      2012. A year later Professor Millican was invited by the Lord Empey of\u000d\u000a      Shandon to a meeting at the House of Lords on the teaching of computer\u000d\u000a      science in schools. This in turn issued in invitations to two HEA\u000d\u000a      workshops at Oxford Brookes for Computer Science and ICT teachers, at both\u000d\u000a      of which he displayed and promoted his software. Several of the teachers\u000d\u000a      decided to try out his software in their schools. These workshops were\u000d\u000a      organized by Alistair Surrall, the Oxfordshire `Computing in Schools\u000d\u000a      Coordinator', who writes, `Oxfordshire schools are lucky to have a local\u000d\u000a      university as supportive as Oxford... The workshops were a great\u000d\u000a      success... Some local schools have been trialling Professor Millican's\u000d\u000a      teaching tool Turtle, created to engage students (and teachers) in the new\u000d\u000a      Computer Science curriculum. We're now investigating the possibility of\u000d\u000a      running robotics workshops in local schools using the university's\u000d\u000a      resources to support the work being done in our classrooms.'[1]\u000d\u000a    Professor Millican also organized a visit for primary school children\u000d\u000a      from Westfields Junior School in Yateley to Oxford, where they used his\u000d\u000a      Turtle system to learn some basic techniques of programming. On a return\u000d\u000a      visit to their school he gave them further exposure to the system, using\u000d\u000a      the most recent hugely improved version of his software. Karine George,\u000d\u000a      headmistress of the school, writes, `As a consequence of [the first visit,\u000d\u000a      the school IT Manager began]... a programming club... using [Professor\u000d\u000a      Millican's software]. The children... gained a great deal from the\u000d\u000a      experience... We do not want our children to be passive consumers of\u000d\u000a      technology, but better able to use their creative talents to imagine a new\u000d\u000a      future... [Professor Millican's] work in [the] school and at Oxford\u000d\u000a      University... has taken [their] coding to a new level... Our year 6\u000d\u000a      children have also been involved in the \"APPs for Good\" programme,\u000d\u000a      normally the reserve of 11 - 18 year olds. This has also involved coding\u000d\u000a      and resulted in them getting to the finals in London.'[2]\u000d\u000a    Among those who have been following and promoting Professor Millican's\u000d\u000a      work in relation to primary and secondary education is David Brown, the\u000d\u000a      Ofsted National Lead for Information and Communication Technology.

This in turn inspired the introduction of a similar degree in\u000d\u000a      Computer Science and Philosophy at the University of York, where he was\u000d\u000a      made an Honorary Visiting Professor in Philosophy in 2011. Members of the\u000d\u000a      Philosophy Department at York had heard Professor Millican's account of\u000d\u000a      the new Oxford degree, and members of both the Philosophy Department and\u000d\u000a      the Computer Science Department had been impressed by the associated\u000d\u000a      research on his website. They were persuaded that there would be\u000d\u000a      considerable interest in a degree at York that combined the two\u000d\u000a      disciplines, and such a degree was established in 2012. Professor Tom\u000d\u000a      Stoneham, Head of the Philosophy Department, has said that he is happy to\u000d\u000a      corroborate this account.[4]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Peter Millican's research on the philosophy of computer\u000d\u000a      programming, and in particular on issues that arise from the power of\u000d\u000a      computation to mimic important intellectual feats, has had a variety of\u000d\u000a      impacts. One of Professor Millican's interests has been stylometrics, and\u000d\u000a      he has developed software which has been used to corroborate a\u000d\u000a      controversial claim that a certain translation of Goethe's Faustus\u000d\u000a      was written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, to cast doubt on a claim that\u000d\u000a      Barack Obama's autobiography was ghost-written by Bill Ayers, and to help\u000d\u000a      expose J.K.

His most important\u000d\u000a      philosophical ideas about these issues, which he has been honing for many\u000d\u000a      years, were eventually published in his 2012 paper `The Philosophical\u000d\u000a      Significance of the Turing Machine and the Turing Test'. His principal\u000d\u000a      conclusion in that paper, which supports the effectiveness of the Turing\u000d\u000a      test, is that if a machine could reliably generate conversation of the\u000d\u000a      quality originally envisaged by Turing himself, then we would have\u000d\u000a      excellent reason for counting the machine as intelligent. There are,\u000d\u000a      however, two caveats to this conclusion. The first is that we would\u000d\u000a      nevertheless have no good reason for counting the machine as consciously\u000d\u000a      aware of anything. The second caveat is that the Turing test is a very\u000d\u000a      poor measure of intelligence. But, partly for these very reasons,\u000d\u000a      Professor Millican is emboldened to claim that machines, however well they\u000d\u000a      might or might not be able to mimic human intelligence, have the potential\u000d\u000a      to be outstandingly good tutors. Indeed he takes it to be an open question\u000d\u000a      whether, and in which fields, a machine could teach as effectively as any\u000d\u000a      good human tutor.\u000d\u000a    As a result of these interests he has also been led to develop several\u000d\u000a      significant programmes in which the power of computation to mimic\u000d\u000a      important intellectual feats, and\/or to serve as teaching resources, has\u000d\u000a      been both tested and exploited. A clear example is Signature, a\u000d\u000a      stylometric system that has attracted attention not least because of its\u000d\u000a      ease of use. Professor Millican has been refining and improving this\u000d\u000a      system ever since he was appointed to his current post in Oxford. It is\u000d\u000a      designed to facilitate a stylistic analysis and comparison of texts, with\u000d\u000a      a particular emphasis on author identification, thereby making it\u000d\u000a      serviceable in helping to cast light on problems of disputed authorship.\u000d\u000a      Another example is Elizabeth. This too is a system that Professor Millican\u000d\u000a      has been refining and improving since he has been in Oxford. It was partly\u000d\u000a      developed to complement and illustrate the philosophical problems about\u000d\u000a      the Turing test that he had been exploring. Although he began to develop\u000d\u000a      the system many years ago, he did not properly think through its\u000d\u000a      implications for the Turing test until late in 2005, when he significantly\u000d\u000a      updated it. Elizabeth is based on the well known paradigm of\u000d\u000a      `chatterbots', namely Joseph Weizenbaum's system Eliza. Indeed it is\u000d\u000a      probably the only system in existence that precisely and transparently\u000d\u000a      mimics Eliza. But it greatly extends Eliza to facilitate the teaching of\u000d\u000a      general principles of artificial intelligence and natural language\u000d\u000a      processing. It uses rules which can be inspected and edited in detail and\u000d\u000a      traced in their precise operation, step by step. Finally there is Turtle,\u000d\u000a      yet another system that Professor Millican has been refining and improving\u000d\u000a      ever since he has been in Oxford. This is an innovative programming system\u000d\u000a      which uses graphics to explain basic principles of programming and\u000d\u000a      compilation and which also provides a series of carefully graded exercise\u000d\u000a      for self-teaching.\u000d\u000a\u0009  Peter Millican is a Professor of Philosophy and has\u000d\u000a      been a Tutorial Fellow at Hertford College since 2005.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19241","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dr Howick's work into philosophical issues concerning the ethics of using\u000a      placebos in clinical trials and in clinical practice has helped to\u000a      determine what types of trial are conducted and what types of treatment\u000a      are used in clinical practice. It has also increased the understanding of\u000a      the general public on the use of placebos.\u000a    (i) Impact on Clinical Tests and Clinical Practice\u000a     `Levels of evidence' had first been introduced in 1998 by the Oxford\u000a      Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, in an attempt to make both the process\u000a      of finding appropriate evidence for diagnostic techniques, prognostic\u000a      markers, therapeutic benefits, and economic analysis and the task of\u000a      explicitly stating the results of that process feasible. On the strength\u000a      of the research for his book The Philosophy of Evidence-Based Medicine,\u000a      Dr Howick was commissioned by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based\u000a      Medicine (OCEBM) to participate in the working group revising the 1998\u000a      levels. The updated version was published in 2011(i) and\u000a      included not only new data but also the new conceptual considerations that\u000a      Dr Howick advances in his book. These new OCEBM levels of evidence\u000a      constitute one of the most widely used systems for ranking evidence in the\u000a      world: direct appeal is made to this system in deciding whether treatments\u000a      are effective, whether diagnoses are accurate, how prevalent diseases are,\u000a      how successful prognostic markers are, and ultimately which treatments\u000a      shall receive approval for marketing. The system is thus used not only by\u000a      medical researchers but also by care-givers, patients, and policy makers.\u000a      Examples of the many and varied recommendations and clinical advice that\u000a      incorporate this system are the 2012 Canadian Guidelines for the\u000a        diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia syndrome and clinical\u000a      practice guidelines on sudden hearing loss that were published in Otolaryngology\u000a      in 2012(ii). Discussions of the practising of evidence-based\u000a      medicine, with links to the levels of evidence, are available on the\u000a      Patient.co.uk website. The levels are also used in teaching, e.g. at the\u000a      University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa(iii).\u000a    Following the ethical concerns expressed in the article `Questioning the\u000a      Methodologic Superiority of \"Placebo\" Over \"Active\" Controlled Trials' a\u000a      change in clinical tests and clinical practice has been observed. Placebo\u000a      use in clinical trials is controversial where an established treatment is\u000a      available: clinicians are generally against its use while methodologists\u000a      claim placebo use is sometimes required to establish efficacy. The article\u000a      examined the controversy and specified well-defined criteria that need to\u000a      be met in order for placebo controlled trials to be ethical. It is having\u000a      an influence on the way policy makers think about placebo controls, as\u000a      evidenced in the article `The Rationale for Placebo-Controlled Trials:\u000a      Methodology and Policy Considerations', by Franklin Miller, Senior Faculty\u000a      of the National Institutes of Health and advisor to the United States Food\u000a      and Drug Administration(iv). The research findings are also\u000a      having a bearing on the way research on placebo controls is being\u000a      conducted, both in the medical sphere(v) and in other areas\u000a      such as social policy(vi). Specifically, the use of placebo\u000a      controls, especially for complex interventions, is coming under increasing\u000a      scrutiny.\u000a    In response to a draft of the survey results of placebo use by UK primary\u000a      care practitioners the General Medical Council (GMC) issued a revision to\u000a      their Good Practice in Prescribing and Managing Medicines and Devices\u000a      guide in clarification of their stance on placebos(vii).\u000a    (ii) Impact on the Reporting of Trials\u000a      The article `What's in Placebos: Who Knows?' prompted a clarification\u000a      from the authors of the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials\u000a      (CONSORT)(viii). CONSORT is a set of recommendations for the\u000a      reporting of trials: it contains a checklist, and many of the top medical\u000a      journals (including British Medical Journal, The Lancet, Journal\u000a        of the American Medical Association, and Annals of Internal\u000a        Medicine) require that potential authors complete the checklist\u000a      before being considered for publication. Evidence for the impact that the\u000a      article has had on how trials are reported is provided by the fact that,\u000a      whereas at the time when the article was written, 83% of trials failed to\u000a      report the composition of the placebo concerned, a later study by\u000a      Ravikiran Sonawane and others, published in 2012(ix), showed\u000a      that this figure, at least in respiratory medicine, had come down to 38%.\u000a    (iii) Increased Public Awareness\u000a      The findings of the article `The Evidence Underpinning Sports Performance\u000a      Products' formed the basis of an edition of BBC's Panorama in July\u000a      2012(x). Both article and documentary received widespread media\u000a      coverage in the UK and internationally, e.g. in Canada, India, and\u000a      Australia where additional comments were included from local sports\u000a      experts and nutritionists(xi).The research and findings were\u000a      also summarised on the NHS website in a discussion section on news\u000a      headlines(xii) and have thereby contributed to changing the way\u000a      in which people think about consuming sports drinks and spending money on\u000a      expensive sports equipment.\u000a    The survey of placebo use by UK primary care practitioners was widely\u000a      picked up by the media (including BBC and Channel 4 news, The Times,\u000a      The Independent, and The Daily Mail)(xiii) and\u000a      therefore increased public awareness of the issues. The article `What's in\u000a      Placebos: Who Knows?' also captured the attention of the general public:\u000a      it was widely reported in the press (including Reuters(xiv), The\u000a        Wall Street Journal, and Science Daily).\u000a    (iv) Advising Professional Groups\u000a      Following the well publicised findings of Dr Howick's research, he is\u000a      often invited to talk to professional groups to discuss professional and\u000a      methodological practices in a variety of fields. Recent examples include a\u000a      Presidential Address to the American Neurophysiological Monitoring Society\u000a      on `Evidence-Based Neurophysiological Monitoring' in Salt Lake City, USA,\u000a      in May 2012; a Plenary Lecture to the European Organization for Research\u000a      and Treatment of Cancer on `New Concepts in Levels of Evidence' in\u000a      Brussels in December 2012, and a talk on `The necessity of conducting\u000a      randomized trials (but not placebo controlled randomized trials) for\u000a      complex interventions in allied health professions' in London in May 2013.\u000a      Following this last meeting Dr Howick was invited to author a follow up\u000a      paper that will guide the use of placebos in UK physiotherapy trials(1).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Jeremy Howick's research into philosophical issues concerning the\u000a      nature of the evidence invoked in evidence-based medicine has led both to\u000a      a revision of the standards for reporting trials, and to a redesign of the\u000a      Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine `Levels of Evidence': one of the\u000a      most widely used systems for ranking medical evidence, and thereby for\u000a      deciding whether treatments are effective, in the world.

Paramount among these are\u000a      issues about the use of placebos. For instance, there are methodological\u000a      issues concerning the level of evidence that the use of placebos affords;\u000a      and there are ethical issues concerning the deception that their use\u000a      involves. These issues are not only interesting in their own right: they\u000a      are also interesting in their interconnection. Take the fact that placebo\u000a      controls are often used in clinical trials when there is an established\u000a      treatment with which the patients mistakenly think the new treatment is\u000a      being compared: the deception involved here seems ethically problematic,\u000a      as indeed does the fact that some of the patients are thereby being denied\u000a      the benefits of the established therapy. But the justification that is\u000a      normally given for the use of placebos in such cases is that placebo\u000a      controlled trials give better evidence than trials using two active\u000a      therapies. So the ethical issues about the use of placebos are directly\u000a      connected to the methodological issues about the level of evidence that\u000a      their use provides.\u000a    Dr Howick is a philosopher of science and ethicist who, since 2007, has\u000a      held a non-clinical research fellowship in the Department of Primary Care\u000a      Health Sciences at Oxford, where he leads a module on the history and\u000a      philosophy of evidence-based healthcare. His research has been concerned\u000a      with exploring the full range of these philosophical issues. He notes that\u000a      there is no way of adequately addressing these questions without first\u000a      grappling with some basic conceptual questions about what a placebo is.\u000a      These questions are more difficult than they appear. For example, it is\u000a      usually claimed that placebos are somehow inactive or have no specific\u000a      effect, but one of the most interesting facts about them is precisely that\u000a      they do often have a specific effect. Furthermore the term `placebo' is\u000a      used to describe a bewildering variety of treatments, ranging from sham\u000a      surgery and sugar pills to attention controls. This wide usage exacerbates\u000a      a problem that arises anyway, namely that a very good treatment may fail\u000a      to outperform a placebo in a given trial simply because the placebo used\u000a      in that trial is itself relatively effective, while a worse rival\u000a      treatment may outperform the placebo that is used in another trial because\u000a      the placebo used in that second trial is not at all effective. Another\u000a      problem is that the term `placebo' may be used whether or not the testing\u000a      is double-blind, but whether or not the testing is double-blind may in\u000a      turn have a significant subliminal bearing on how the patients react to\u000a      the treatment that is administered to them.\u000a    In his article `Questioning the Methodologic Superiority of \"Placebo\"\u000a      Over \"Active\" Controlled Trials', Dr Howick exploits his answers to some\u000a      of these basic conceptual questions to consider the reasons that are\u000a      commonly given for thinking that placebo controlled trials afford better\u000a      evidence than trials using two active therapies. He concludes that these\u000a      reasons are inadequate, and that the ethical concerns about placebo\u000a      controlled trials therefore remain unmitigated.\u000a    In the article `What's in Placebos: Who Knows?' he and his co-authors\u000a      (from the University of California at San Diego) note that there is no\u000a      regulation concerning placebo composition &#8212; which is itself a further\u000a      illustration of how widely the term `placebo' can be used &#8212; and that, at\u000a      the time, the great majority of trials involving pills or capsules (nearly\u000a      92%) and the majority of trials involving injections and other treatments\u000a      (over 73%) fail to report the composition of the placebo concerned,\u000a      despite its obvious potential influence on the outcome of the trial. The\u000a      authors conclude that this is another ethically and methodologically\u000a      unsatisfactory feature of the common use of placebos.\u000a    In Dr Howick's book The Philosophy of Evidence-Based Medicine he\u000a      turns his attention to the more overtly methodological issues about the\u000a      nature and quality of the evidence invoked in evidence-based medicine and\u000a      provides a theoretical framework for distinguishing between different\u000a      levels of such evidence. And in `The Evidence Underpinning Sports\u000a      Performance Products', Dr Howick and others appeal to these revised levels\u000a      of evidence to expose ways in which products that are supposed to improve\u000a      sports performance are misleadingly advertised.\u000a    In 2012 a web-based questionnaire was used to survey UK General\u000a      Practitioners (GPs) in an attempt to quantify the routine use of placebos\u000a      in UK primary care. Dr Howick was the lead author of the 2013 report in\u000a      which the results were published. It showed that placebos were one of the\u000a      more commonly used treatments by GPs and raised unresolved ethical issues\u000a      about how GPs approach informed consent, in relation to their\u000a      prescriptions of placebos.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23151","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The principal impact of Dawson's work has been on the development of\u000d\u000a        public health ethics\u000d\u000a        frameworks, which have led to changes to policy and professional\u000d\u000a      behaviour around the\u000d\u000a      implementation of public health ethics programmes. In addition to the\u000d\u000a      impact of his publications, he\u000d\u000a      has also used his research when acting as a consultant on expert advisory\u000d\u000a      panels. The research\u000d\u000a      and public engagement have influenced each other.\u000d\u000a    (a) World Health Organisation Task Force: Ethical Guidance for\u000d\u000a          Tuberculosis interventions\u000d\u000a      As a result of his research on bioethics, vaccinations and infectious\u000d\u000a      diseases, Professor Dawson\u000d\u000a      was appointed as one of the twenty-two Expert Members of the World Health\u000d\u000a      Organisation (WHO)\u000d\u000a      Task Force on Addressing Ethical Issues in Tuberculosis Care and\u000d\u000a        Control Programmes, which\u000d\u000a      was formed in 2008. The Task Force was required to complete a\u000d\u000a      comprehensive analysis of the\u000d\u000a      ethical issues in TB and formulate and produce guidance. The resulting\u000d\u000a      document, Guidance on\u000d\u000a        ethics of tuberculosis prevention, care and control [source 1], was\u000d\u000a      published in Dec 2010 with the\u000d\u000a      purpose of providing governments and other stakeholders with guidance on\u000d\u000a      how to implement TB\u000d\u000a      care and control programmes in an ethical way [source 2]. Dawson wrote the\u000d\u000a      first draft of the\u000d\u000a      section on values at the start of the document (a fifth of the total text)\u000d\u000a      and his definition of public\u000d\u000a      health is used centrally in the document to identify the need for\u000d\u000a      co-ordinated action to generate\u000d\u000a      conditions in which all members of the community are protected (p. 6).\u000d\u000a      This document provides the\u000d\u000a      ethical reasoning for the collectively organised (public health) action on\u000d\u000a      TB that the WHO\u000d\u000a      advocate, and adds significant weight to the WHO argument that access to\u000d\u000a      TB care is a global\u000d\u000a      welfare right that governments have a duty to provide. The impact of this\u000d\u000a      document has been\u000d\u000a      substantial in the attention that has been paid to it by the target\u000d\u000a      audience; for example, it is cited by\u000d\u000a      Public Health England as a key document on TB for Health Workers [source\u000d\u000a      3]; its impact\u000d\u000a      continues as this document is still used today as a basis of training\u000d\u000a      workshops focused on frontline\u000d\u000a      medical staff and national policy makers by WHO's Stop TB campaign all\u000d\u000a      around the world.\u000d\u000a    (b) A Public Health Ethics Framework: Ontario, Canada\u000d\u000a      Public Health Ontario is responsible for all aspects of public health\u000d\u000a      activity in Ontario (the most\u000d\u000a      populous province in Canada). Dawson was one of six members of the\u000d\u000a      Conceptual Framework\u000d\u000a      Working Group. The group's first publication was a consultation document An\u000d\u000a        Ethical Framework\u000d\u000a        for Public Health Projects: A Discussion Paper. The document uses\u000d\u000a      Verweij and Dawson's\u000d\u000a      definition of Public Health as a key definition (2011, source 4, p. 3).\u000d\u000a      This was circulated to various\u000d\u000a      public health professionals and academics in the Province. This discussion\u000d\u000a      paper and subsequent\u000d\u000a      feedback was then used to inform the development of a framework in 2012, A\u000d\u000a        Framework for the\u000d\u000a        Ethical Conduct of Public Health Initiatives [source 5], to `guide\u000d\u000a      the ethical conduct of evidence-generating\u000d\u000a      public health initiatives'. This white paper adopts the public health\u000d\u000a      framework approach\u000d\u000a      of Dawson whereby questions are used to examine the issues and to consider\u000d\u000a      the interests of all\u000d\u000a      stakeholders, particularly emphasising the positive obligation to promote\u000d\u000a      equality and reciprocity\u000d\u000a      [source 5]. It cites Dawson and his work throughout, in particular drawing\u000d\u000a      on his research to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate the need to develop a framework specifically for public health\u000d\u000a      ethics (p. 6) and to\u000d\u000a      explain how the framework is necessary for providing guidance to determine\u000d\u000a      when public health\u000d\u000a      interventions may restrict individual autonomy (p. 7). This framework has\u000d\u000a      been useful in guiding\u000d\u000a      Public Health Ontario (PHO) in the development of a new ethics review\u000d\u000a      approach, with the\u000d\u000a      framework being used to guide investigators in the ethical reflection of\u000d\u000a      core principles in the\u000d\u000a      planning and review of evidence-generating public health initiatives, for\u000d\u000a      example in program\u000d\u000a      evaluation, surveillance, quality improvement activities, and public\u000d\u000a      health research. This approach\u000d\u000a      is currently being piloted by Public Health Ontario staff through a suite\u000d\u000a      of ethics support services\u000d\u000a      which include (1) ethics advisory services, (2) ethics education, (3)\u000d\u000a      public health ethics resources\u000d\u000a      and (4) ethics review process and board, and so is used by public health\u000d\u000a      professionals in Ontario\u000d\u000a      on a daily basis [source 6].\u000d\u000a    (c) British Medical Association: Advice on Hepatitis B vaccination\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a      Dawson's research has influenced debate among medical practitioners about\u000d\u000a      universal\u000d\u000a      vaccination. An article by Dawson in The Lancet (Dawson, 2005)\u000d\u000a      advocates the universal\u000d\u000a      immunisation of children in low-risk countries, such as the UK, as a\u000d\u000a      preventative measure against\u000d\u000a      the dangers posed by this quickly spreading disease based on his wider\u000d\u000a      arguments about public\u000d\u000a      health. This appears as a key citation in the British Medical\u000d\u000a      Association's policy on \"Hepatitis\u000d\u000a      vaccination in childhood\" [source 7], in support of their call for\u000d\u000a      universal immunisation. When it was\u000d\u000a      first published in 2006 (subsequently updated, in 2010) it received wide\u000d\u000a      media attention [source 8].\u000d\u000a      Dawson's article is also cited in a paper on childhood vaccinations\u000d\u000a      [source 9] in a practitioner\u000d\u000a      journal for paediatricians and health care professionals. The paper\u000d\u000a      advocates Hep B childhood\u000d\u000a      vaccinations and uses Dawson's article to support this argument.\u000d\u000a    (d) M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) Ethics Review Board\u000d\u000a      Dawson has been a member of M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res Ethics Review Board\u000d\u000a      (MSF ERB) since\u000d\u000a      2009. The ERB reviews all MSF research (used by MSF to improve its\u000d\u000a      clinical practice and\u000d\u000a      advocacy work) and provides guidance on working\/practical issues and\u000d\u000a      policies. In 2013 the ERB\u000d\u000a      produced a new document entitled Ethical Guidelines for Research.\u000d\u000a      This document was largely\u000d\u000a      written by Dawson and adopts his approach to frameworks (Dawson 2009) &#8212; a\u000d\u000a      series of ordered\u000d\u000a      questions to facilitate deliberation by researchers and other non-experts\u000d\u000a      &#8212; about how to produce\u000d\u000a      ethical research. This is now the key document for discussing ethics in\u000d\u000a      all research conducted by\u000d\u000a      or sponsored by MSF [source 10].\u000d\u000a    Outlined here are specific examples where Dawson has had significant\u000d\u000a      impact on the development\u000d\u000a      of particular approaches to addressing public health ethics. But by\u000d\u000a      establishing public health ethics\u000d\u000a      as a distinct sub-discipline within bioethics (for example, through\u000d\u000a      establishing the key Public Health\u000d\u000a      Ethics Journal and editing collections of papers) Dawson has been\u000d\u000a      instrumental in the construction\u000d\u000a      of public health ethics in itself and therefore has facilitated the\u000d\u000a      impacts of others working in the\u000d\u000a      field.

His central argument is that\u000d\u000a      it is essential to explore\u000d\u000a      the relevant ethical issues within the context of public health as a\u000d\u000a      practice, rather than adopting the\u000d\u000a      dominant approach drawn from medical ethics. The main thrust of Dawson's\u000d\u000a      research has been:\u000d\u000a      (1) to draw out the unique aspects of ethical decision-making in public\u000d\u000a      health interventions and\u000d\u000a      policy, and (2) to provide an approach to developing ethical frameworks\u000d\u000a      through which public\u000d\u000a      health ethical decisions can be made.\u000d\u000a    (1) Defining Public Health Ethics:\u000d\u000a    Dawson's work focuses on articulating an account of public health ethics\u000d\u000a      that builds upon both an\u000d\u000a      account of `public health' as a concept, as well as the values that are\u000d\u000a      visible in public health as a\u000d\u000a      practice. Dawson argues that our account of public health ethics should be\u000d\u000a      of practical and\u000d\u000a      operational use in public health decision-making, and should not just\u000d\u000a      uncritically employ values\u000d\u000a      from elsewhere (such as medical ethics) (Dawson, 2010, 2011).\u000d\u000a    He has argued that through focusing on different senses of `public' at\u000d\u000a      work in `public health' we can\u000d\u000a      make the best case for exploring the acceptability of public health\u000d\u000a      interventions (Verweij &amp;\u000d\u000a      Dawson, 2007). Further, he argues that citizens, as members of a community\u000d\u000a      and society, are\u000d\u000a      under some obligation to contribute to the common good and, as such, this\u000d\u000a      may justify an\u000d\u000a      obligation to participate in public health programmes. Additionally, the\u000d\u000a      magnitudes of the risks and\u000d\u000a      goods will contribute to the strength of the case for this obligation to\u000d\u000a      participate (Dawson 2004,\u000d\u000a      2005a, 2005b, 2007).\u000d\u000a    This final aspect of Dawson's definition of public health ethics, that\u000d\u000a      citizens may be obligated to\u000d\u000a      participate in public health interventions, challenges what he refers to\u000d\u000a      as the special status given to\u000d\u000a      the `liberal' position in medical ethics, whereby individuals are `free'\u000d\u000a      to make their own decisions\u000d\u000a      about the best course of action for themselves. While his work maintains\u000d\u000a      that individual liberty is\u000d\u000a      still an essential value, he argues that there are other values of equal\u000d\u000a      importance that should be\u000d\u000a      considered alongside this. He proposes a reorientation to look at what is\u000d\u000a      shared by human beings\u000d\u000a      as social creatures, arguing that this enables debates about public health\u000d\u000a      to be informed by\u000d\u000a      considerations concerning the common good alongside respect for individual\u000d\u000a      freedom. This suggests a\u000d\u000a      pluralistic system for public health that is able to consider both the\u000d\u000a      individual and the collective\u000d\u000a      (Dawson 2010, 2011).\u000d\u000a    (2) A Public Health Ethics Framework:\u000d\u000a      In light of his approach to public health ethics, Dawson has argued that\u000d\u000a      developing frameworks\u000d\u000a      related to decisions to be made about public health interventions aids\u000d\u000a      deliberation by making\u000d\u000a      relevant values explicit (Dawson 2009, 2010, 2011). He argues that this\u000d\u000a      type of ethical framework\u000d\u000a      should ask questions of potential public health interventions as a means\u000d\u000a      of aiding deliberation,\u000d\u000a      rather than providing a checklist of instructions to be ticked off. This\u000d\u000a      method of developing and\u000d\u000a      using a framework provides a sophisticated means of opening up more\u000d\u000a      complex ethical questions &#8212; a\u000d\u000a      way of challenging but not necessarily overriding privileged and assumed\u000d\u000a      positions, particularly\u000d\u000a      that of the solitary and unconnected individual and the liberty of that\u000d\u000a      individual. In this way, Dawson\u000d\u000a      argues that good policy framework allows for broader questions, such as\u000d\u000a      about the kind of society\u000d\u000a      we want to live in and the way in which public health interventions may\u000d\u000a      help achieve these ends, to\u000d\u000a      be articulated.\u000d\u000a    Dawson was at Keele from 2000 to 2011 as Lecturer and Senior Lecturer.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23237","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Wilkinson's research impacts fall into two main categories: (a) targeted\u000d\u000a      interventions in\u000d\u000a      policymaking processes, which seek to influence and\/or inform law and\u000d\u000a      policy; (b) public and\u000d\u000a      stakeholder engagement, which seeks to stimulate and to improve the\u000d\u000a      quality of debate.\u000d\u000a    Influencing and Informing Policymaking\u000d\u000a      Since the mid-2000s, Wilkinson has sought to influence and improve\u000d\u000a      policymaking by providing\u000d\u000a      information and evidence to those involved in policy formation processes\u000d\u000a      (including but not limited\u000d\u000a      to law reform). Some key examples are listed below.\u000d\u000a    (a) Sheldon and Wilkinson's work on `saviour siblings' influenced the\u000d\u000a        Human Fertilisation and\u000d\u000a        Embryology (HFE) Act 2008. Research carried out between 2003 and\u000d\u000a      2009 generated novel\u000d\u000a      arguments not only for permitting what came to be known as the creation\u000d\u000a      and selection of `saviour\u000d\u000a      siblings' but also for the extension of this practice to cases in which\u000d\u000a      the recipient is not a sibling,\u000d\u000a      cases in which the tissue in question is a solid organ rather than merely\u000d\u000a      umbilical cord blood, and\u000d\u000a      cases involving non-life-threatening conditions.\u000d\u000a    As well as enabling a challenge to `conventional wisdom', this work\u000d\u000a      influenced the wording of the\u000d\u000a      HFE legislation. One important issue debated in Parliament was whether or\u000d\u000a      not the use of `saviour\u000d\u000a      siblings' should be restricted to medical conditions which are\u000d\u000a      life-threatening or life-shortening.\u000d\u000a      Sheldon and Wilkinson submitted written evidence to the Joint Committee on\u000d\u000a      the Human Tissue\u000d\u000a      and Embryos (Draft) Bill and Lord Jenkin of Roding claimed in the House of\u000d\u000a      Lords that this was the\u000d\u000a      basis on which his committee came to its view on this matter. He stated &#8212;\u000d\u000a      \"We [the Joint\u000d\u000a      Committee] came to the conclusion that it really would be unduly\u000d\u000a      restrictive to refuse permission for\u000d\u000a      a saviour sibling to be used in those circumstances. We based this on\u000d\u000a        the evidence of two\u000d\u000a        distinguished academics, Professor Sheldon and Professor Wilkinson\".\u000d\u000a      The statement is to be\u000d\u000a      found in their memorandum at pages 454 and 455 of the evidence [Source 1].\u000d\u000a      In addition, Sheldon\u000d\u000a      and Wilkinson's evidence is discussed alongside that of the Human\u000d\u000a      Fertilisation and Embryology\u000d\u000a      Authority (HFEA) in the written report of the Joint Committee on the Human\u000d\u000a      Tissue and Embryos\u000d\u000a      (Draft) Bill [Source 2].\u000d\u000a    (b) Wilkinson submitted written evidence (based on his earlier research\u000d\u000a      on selective reproduction)\u000d\u000a      to the July 2013 Parliamentary Inquiry into Abortion on the Grounds of\u000d\u000a        Disability [Source 3].\u000d\u000a      He is mentioned eight times in the report.\u000d\u000a    (c) Wilkinson is mentioned six times in the Nuffield Council on\u000d\u000a        Bioethics' high-profile 2011\u000d\u000a        report, Human Bodies donation for medicine and research [Source\u000d\u000a      4]. Wilkinson (2003) is\u000d\u000a      favourably cited, and the Nuffield Council testify that Wilkinson provided\u000d\u000a      thoughtful and challenging\u000d\u000a      critiques of the draft ethics chapters, leading to the Working Party\u000d\u000a      re-working and\/or strengthening\u000d\u000a      the arguments made.\u000d\u000a    (d) Wilkinson's research on the ethics of organ donation and sale led to\u000d\u000a      membership of the Ethical\u000d\u000a        Advisory Sub-Group of the Organ Donation Task Force (established by\u000d\u000a      the Department of\u000d\u000a      Health). The remit of this group was to advise the main Task Force on the\u000d\u000a      ethical bases of different\u000d\u000a      consent systems and the ethical acceptability of different systems. The\u000d\u000a      work of the Sub-Group was\u000d\u000a      reported in the Organ Donation Task Force's report: The Potential\u000d\u000a        Impact of an Opt Out System for\u000d\u000a        Organ Donation in the UK (November 2008). \u000d\u000a    (e) In 2012, Wilkinson acted as the `ethics expert' at a public dialogue\u000d\u000a      event in Newcastle-upon-Tyne,\u000d\u000a      organised for the HFEA by Dialogue by Design, a consultancy that\u000d\u000a      specialises in running\u000d\u000a      public and stakeholder engagement processes. The consultation in question\u000d\u000a      was entitled Medical\u000d\u000a        Frontiers: debating mitochondrial replacement, which the HFEA ran on\u000d\u000a      behalf of the UK\u000d\u000a      government. His role included giving three short talks on the ethical\u000d\u000a      questions, and being on hand\u000d\u000a      to help members of the public understand particular issues. These events\u000d\u000a      eventually fed into the\u000d\u000a      HFEA's 2013 policy recommendations on mitochondrial replacement, which\u000d\u000a      have been broadly\u000d\u000a      accepted by the UK government.\u000d\u000a    Stimulating and Improving Debate\u000d\u000a    Wilkinson's work on `social' sex selection stimulated debate amongst the\u000d\u000a      public and stakeholders\u000d\u000a      and has enabled improved public understanding via a series of appearances\u000d\u000a      in popular news\u000d\u000a      media. The key findings of this work were widely reported in the media and\u000d\u000a      were made available\u000d\u000a      via short pieces on the BBC News and This is Staffordshire\u000d\u000a      websites. In 2010, these pieces in turn\u000d\u000a      led to considerable media interest with interviews given to more than ten\u000d\u000a      UK local radio stations, as\u000d\u000a      well as to BBC Radio 5 Live, the World Service, LBC, BBC Radio Scotland,\u000d\u000a      the BBC TV News\u000d\u000a      Channel, and BBC 1 TV's The One Show which at that time had an\u000d\u000a      audience of around four million\u000d\u000a      viewers. He also appeared on a 30-minute panel discussion on Voice of\u000d\u000a      Russia Radio in 2010 to\u000d\u000a      discuss Sex Selection.\u000d\u000a    In 2011-12, Wilkinson held a Wellcome Trust Dissemination Award\u000d\u000a      (&#163;34,000). This grant funded\u000d\u000a      the following activities:\u000d\u000a    (a) Two stakeholder engagement seminars (2011).

A spin-off from this project was a range of new sensory\u000d\u000a      augmentation devices for iPod and iPhones, which are freely available\u000d\u000a      through iTunes. (See corroboration [1 a &amp; b]).\u000d\u000a    Clark's (2008) book also led to his recruitment, in 2011, as scientific\u000d\u000a      advisor to a game design studio, 'Hide &amp; Seek', which develops iPhone,\u000d\u000a      Xbox, and Kinect apps that give users a chance to experiment with emerging\u000d\u000a      technologies, thereby increasing public engagement with, and understanding\u000d\u000a      of, the sciences. For example, `Hide &amp; Seek' were interested in\u000d\u000a      exploring scientific effects relating to sensory augmentation and the\u000d\u000a      distribution of control, where this interest was embedded within the\u000d\u000a      philosophical framework set out in Clark (2008). (See corroboration [2],\u000d\u000a      [10]).\u000d\u000a    In 2012 Clark presented the extended mind thesis at a meeting held at the\u000d\u000a      Pompidou Centre in Paris devoted to the emerging science of the web. A\u000d\u000a      second presentation for web developers at the Googleplex (Mountain View,\u000d\u000a      California) followed in 2013. Clark's work has already impacted on the\u000d\u000a      emerging theory of web science, as shown by technical reports such as Paul\u000d\u000a      Smart's `The Web Extended Mind'. This report (which develops the notion of\u000d\u000a      the so-called `real-world web') repeatedly references Clark's ideas, and\u000d\u000a      makes explicit use of three key criteria for cognitive extension drawn\u000d\u000a      from Clark (2008) and (2010a). (See corroboration [3 a, b, c &amp; d],\u000d\u000a      [11]).\u000d\u000a    The concept of the extended mind as presented in Clark (2008) has also\u000d\u000a    impacted on the general area of technical communications research, as\u000d\u000a    evidenced by the recent report in Technical Communication Quarterly\u000d\u000a    (`Future Convergences: Technical Communication Research as Cognitive\u000d\u000a    Science'). This report, written for professionals in technical\u000d\u000a    communication, begins by citing Clark (2008)f8e7indeed, Clark is the only\u000d\u000a    author mentioned in the report's abstractf8e7and contains 135 references to\u000d\u000a    Clark's work on the extended mind hypothesis. (See corroboration [4]).\u000d\u000a    (ii) Impact on Public Discourse\u000d\u000a    Clark presented the technological developments that came about as part of\u000d\u000a      the AHRC `e-sense' project (see `grants' above) to more than 300\u000d\u000a      schoolchildren at the `Bright Sparks' event at the Brighton Science\u000d\u000a      Festival in 2009 (an event which was attended by around 2000 people). (See\u000d\u000a      corroboration [5]).\u000d\u000a    Clark presented the main ideas in Clark (2008) as part of a public\u000d\u000a      discussion on `Reclaiming the Body' that was held at the How the Light\u000d\u000a        Gets In festival that formed part of the 2010 Hay-on-Wye\u000d\u000a      international book festival. The theme for the How the Light Gets In\u000d\u000a      festival was `Being Human'. It was attended by more than 3000 people over\u000d\u000a      the two weekends of talks, and was widely reported in the mainstream\u000d\u000a      media. (See corroboration [6]).\u000d\u000a    In 2010 Clark was invited to write a blog for the New York Times\u000d\u000a      based on his (2008) work on the extended mind hypothesis. This resulted in\u000d\u000a      a significant and inspectable feedback cycle whereby public responses\u000d\u000a      appeared on the blog, with replies from Clark (both in the blog and to\u000d\u000a      individual emailers). The blog piece, `Out of Our Brains', appeared on the\u000d\u000a      New York Times `Opinionator' blog in 2010, a blog that is read by\u000d\u000a      around 500K people.

(See corroboration [8]).\u000d\u000a    (iii) Think Tank\u000d\u000a    There is now an online, Finland-based, `Extended Mind Think Tank' that is\u000d\u000a      devoted to drawing together the technological, psychological, and\u000d\u000a      conceptual implications of the extended mind thesis. The Extended Mind\u000d\u000a      Think Tank is \"a loosely put together informal group of people interested\u000d\u000a      in figuring out what the extended mind is, and how it could be implemented\u000d\u000a      and used\". The Think Tank includes, as active members, computer games\u000d\u000a      developers and the CEOs of several internet companies. This initiative was\u000d\u000a      directly influenced by Clark's work on the extended mind, especially Clark\u000d\u000a      (2008). (See corroboration [9]).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Clark is the foremost exponent of the extended mind hypothesis,\u000d\u000a      which is the claim that what constitutes human thought and reason are not\u000d\u000a      factors entirely `in the head', but can include technologies, social\u000d\u000a      networks, and institutional structures. This research has generated impact\u000d\u000a      across a diverse range of non-academic beneficiaries. First, there has\u000d\u000a      been technological impact: this research has led to the production\u000d\u000a      of novel technologies, such as new gaming applications, and has\u000d\u000a      contributed to scientific thinking within the IT industry and within the\u000d\u000a      field of technical communications. Second, there has been an impact on public\u000a        discourse, including educational impact: Clark's presentation of\u000d\u000a      these ideas has led to an enhanced public understanding of the important\u000d\u000a      social and cultural implications of our contemporary dependence on\u000d\u000a      technology and social networks. Third, this research has led to the\u000d\u000a      development of an online think tank that brings together the\u000d\u000a      technological, psychological, and conceptual ramifications of the extended\u000d\u000a      mind hypothesis. This is impact that is in the first instance cultural,\u000d\u000a      but which also has obvious implications for economic development\u000d\u000a      and policy making.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    The University of Edinburgh\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Edinburgh (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Edinburgh","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007790}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2654710","Name":"Brighton"},{"GeoNamesId":"2988507","Name":"Paris"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    PUBLICATIONS\u000d\u000a    \u000aClark, A.

This hypothesis invites\u000d\u000a      us to consider technologies, social networks, and institutional structures\u000d\u000a      as proper parts of distributed organs for thought. The extended mind\u000d\u000a      hypothesis was originally formulated by Clark in collaboration with David\u000d\u000a      Chalmers in the late 1990s (see their 1998 paper, `The Extended Mind' Analysis\u000d\u000a      58, 7-19). But its recent impact is directly traceable to Clark's highly\u000d\u000a      regarded 2008 Oxford University Press monograph, Supersizing the Mind:\u000d\u000a        Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension. The importance of this\u000d\u000a      work is reflected in the fact that it is one of the most widely cited\u000d\u000a      monographs in philosophy in recent years, with over 1000 citations already\u000d\u000a      (source: Google Scholar).\u000d\u000a    To see the shape of the claim, it helps to start with a simple comparison\u000d\u000a      to the use of prosthetic limbs. After a while, a good prosthetic limb\u000d\u000a      functions not as a mere tool but as a non-biological body part.\u000d\u000a      Increasingly, the form and structure of such limbs is geared to specific\u000d\u000a      functions and need not replicate the full form and structure of the\u000d\u000a      original biological template. As our information-processing technologies\u000d\u000a      improve and become better adapted to fit the niche provided by the\u000d\u000a      biological brain, they too become more like such prosthetics. But they are\u000d\u000a      cognitive prosthetics: non-biological circuits looping outside the\u000d\u000a      biological organism that come to be integrated into the material\u000d\u000a      underpinnings of human minds. Contentiously, the extended mind hypothesis\u000d\u000a      depicts such integrations as occurring without the need for direct wiring\u000d\u000a      using `brain-ports' or other such technologies. By shifting the emphasis\u000d\u000a      from implants with wired interfacing to `explants' with wire-free\u000d\u000a      communication, the claim embraces a large sweep of new (and old) devices\u000d\u000a      and technologies. If a wired interface is acceptable then, at least in\u000d\u000a      principle, a wire-free interface (such as one that links your brain to\u000d\u000a      your notepad, Blackberry or iPhone) should be acceptable too. What counts\u000d\u000a      is the flow and alteration of information, not the medium through which it\u000d\u000a      moves.\u000d\u000a    Some of the research themes in Clark (2008) have been further developed\u000d\u000a      in Clark (2010a; 2010b; 2010c). Clark (2008) has also recently been the\u000d\u000a      subject of an important and high-profile book symposium that incorporates\u000d\u000a      a significant new contribution from Clark (see Clark 2011). This body of\u000d\u000a      research has also been very important to Clark's role in two large\u000d\u000a      collaborative research grant projects (see `grants' below), both of which\u000d\u000a      are centrally concerned with the extended mind hypothesis, and both of\u000d\u000a      which have been judged as completed successfully by the funding bodies\u000d\u000a      concerned.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24028","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    There are two impacts of Phemister's research on embodied values, one on\u000a      artistic output and the other on psychotherapeutic theory and practice. In\u000a      both cases there is clear evidence that the relevant non-academic parties\u000a      did not merely engage with Phemister's research, but that it also directly\u000a      influenced their professional practice in important and discernible ways.\u000a    (i) Art\u000a    The first example of impact concerns the artistic output of the prominent\u000a      ecological artists Tim Collins and Reiko Goto (formerly research fellows\u000a      at the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, CMU, Pittsburgh, and more recently\u000a      involved in the EDEN3 five-year project, which brings together artists and\u000a      scientists in understanding the biogenic interaction of trees with the\u000a      changing environment and climate of cities; see corroboration [2], [3 a\u000a      &amp; b]). Collins and Goto participated in the 2007-08 British Academy\u000a      `Embodied Values' workshops with which Phemister was centrally involved\u000a      (see `grants' above and corroboration [4]). Since this time, Phemister has\u000a      had many conversations with them, and particularly with Collins, on\u000a      human-environment relations, especially those grounded in relations based\u000a      on sympathy or empathy, the role of relations in the formation of\u000a      individual identity, representation\/mirroring, and the possibility of\u000a      symbiotic transfers of values from humans to environment in places\u000a      considered as `value-places'. These interconnected concepts are\u000a      foundational to the ecological metaphysics that Phemister has been\u000a      expounding since the mid-2000s&#8212;see, especially, Phemister (2011).\u000a      Accordingly, her work became very influential on Collins's thinking as an\u000a      artist (and, through him, influential on the work of his main artistic\u000a      collaborator, Goto, as well). As Collins himself noted, in a (transcribed)\u000a      talk that he gave while he was a Visiting Fellow at Edinburgh's Institute\u000a      for Advanced Studies in the Humanities (IASH) in 2010 (see corroboration\u000a      [5 a &amp; b]): \"This is all very experimental work and the philosophy\u000a      [...] on the video comes out of the conversations I was having with\u000a      Pauline [Phemister].\"\u000a    Phemister's research has also been instrumental in the development of new\u000a      works of art. In particular, as Collins makes explicit in his written\u000a      supporting testimony (see corroboration [1]), Phemister's work was crucial\u000a      to the development of Collins &amp; Goto's `Plein Air: The Schelling Piper\u000a      Experiments' artwork, exhibited in 2010 at the Peacock Centre in Aberdeen\u000a      as part of the Plein Air: The Ethical Aesthetic Impulse\u000a      exhibition. In his supporting testimony Collins writes that Phemister's\u000a      \"argument for the evolution of a space of relational value, a new\u000a      conjoined responsibility that is the antithesis of dominion\" influenced\u000a      him to the extent that it \"resulted in the production of new work\", where\u000a      by this he means the Collins &amp; Goto `Plein Air: The Schelling Piper\u000a      Experiments' artwork. This is a multi-media installation monitoring the\u000a      life of a single tree in Aberdeen city centre over a 24-hour period, and\u000a      its response to atmospheric changes, in particular to the effect of CO2\u000a      levels, as an experiential tangible interface with climate change. Data\u000a      are translated into sounds and the multi-media exhibit is designed to be\u000a      portable to public forests, gardens and parks. (See corroboration [1], [5\u000a      a &amp; b], [6]).\u000a    Phemister's research on embodied values has thus not only influenced the\u000a      work of two important contemporary artists, but directly led to the\u000a      production of a significant and high-profile work of art.\u000a    (ii) Psychotherapy\u000a    The influential Romanian psychotherapist, Dr. Alexandra Parvan, of the\u000a      Bucharest-based Romanian Society for Experiential Psychotherapy&#8212;Societatea\u000a        de Psihoterapie Experien&#354;ial&#259; Rom&#226;n&#259; (SPER)&#8212;has been heavily\u000a      influenced by Phemister's work on embodied values. As she notes in her\u000a      written supporting testimony (see corroboration [7]), Phemister's\u000a      research&#8212;in particular, Phemister (2011)&#8212;has had a \"profound impact on my\u000a      work as a mental health practitioner.\" She goes on to say that Phemister's\u000a      research made her \"more aware of the way I am experiencing my own self as\u000a      being placed within what she [Phemister] calls `physical' and\u000a      `psychical' spaces\" and prompted her to \"consciously explore my relation\u000a      with the immediate environment and the consequences of my active or\u000a      passive engagement with it.\" Phemister's research, she writes, \"made me\u000a      realise that philosophical ideas on human beings' placedness or placed\u000a      existence can constitute an important resource for psychotherapeutic\u000a      work.\" Given the prominence of Dr. Parvan within Romanian\u000a      psychotherapeutic practitioners&#8212;through, in particular, her engagement\u000a      with SPER, where she is a leading figure&#8212;the influence of Phemister's\u000a      research on how Dr. Parvan approaches her professional work has\u000a      implications beyond her own individual therapeutic practices. (See\u000a      corroboration [7], [8]).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Phemister has developed a distinctive body of work that articulates a\u000a      non-anthropocentric, ecological, relational metaphysics and ethics, a\u000a      position that she describes as embodied values.

This involves a teleological, relational\u000a      theory of space that is at once physical and psychical, arising not only\u000a      from relations among the bodies of living creatures, but equally from\u000a      relations deriving from their conative and perceptual qualities (primarily\u000a      relations grounded in perceptions of beauty that give rise to feelings of\u000a      love and a conception of justice as universal benevolence). Phemister's\u000a      aim has been to find new ways of thinking about spaces and places in terms\u000a      of their moral, aesthetic and spiritual values.\u000a    This research led to a series of funded projects, starting in 2007 (see\u000a      `grants' below), with which Phemister was centrally involved and which\u000a      provided her with an opportunity to engage with others interested in\u000a      ecological issues, not just outside of her subject area, but also outside\u000a      of academia altogether, such as artists and practising psychotherapists.\u000a      Both of the finished projects have been judged to have been completed\u000a      successfully by the relevant funding bodies. This body of research, which\u000a      has been extensively presented and disseminated to both academic and\u000a      non-academic interested parties since the mid-2000s, has since been\u000a      published by internationally respected publishers and in peer-reviewed\u000a      journals (Phemister 2010; 2011; Brady &amp; Phemister 2012).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24029","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Vierkant has a long-standing track-record of internationally regarded\u000a      research on the philosophical implications of recent advances in\u000a      neuroscience, particularly with regard to the topics of free will and\u000a      moral responsibility (Vierkant 2005; 2007; 2008; 2011; 2012; 2013). For\u000a      many years now Vierkant has been involved in using this research to tackle\u000a      misperceptions of the neurosciences in the public sphere, such as they\u000a      arise in the media or with regard to public policy and the law.\u000a    Since 2007 Vierkant has been extensively involved with the Scottish\u000a      Imaging Network (`SINAPSE') project on `Brain Imaging and Society'. This\u000a      project is concerned with the implications that brain imaging has for\u000a      society, where this covers such issues as the relationship between\u000a      contemporary neuroscience and free will. In 2010 he was a speaker and\u000a      commentator at a major international conference that was hosted as part of\u000a      this projectf8e7entitled `Brain Imaging and Society: Law'f8e7which looked\u000a      at the legal implications, such as in terms of the scope of an agent's\u000a      moral responsibility for her actions, of recent developments in\u000a      contemporary neuroscience. This event was attended by a wide cross-section\u000a      of interested parties, including judges, NHS medical directors, and\u000a      representatives of the Scottish Parliament's Scottish Future's Forum (an\u000a      organisation created by the Scottish Parliament to interface with policy\u000a      makers, business, and academia, with a view to formulating long-term\u000a      Scottish Government policy). While Vierkant's research has informed his\u000a      contribution to this project, he has also published research that has\u000a      directly arisen out of his engagement with the project, such as Vierkant\u000a      (2011). (See corroboration [1 a, b &amp; c]).\u000a    In contributing to the SINAPSE project Vierkant came into contact with\u000a      the policy officer of the Church of Scotland. On the basis of Vierkant's\u000a      research expertise, he was invited by the policy officer to join their\u000a      Society, Religion and Technology working group. In particular, he was\u000a      commissioned by the Church of Scotland to advise them on issues\u000a      surrounding the importance of neuroscience for free will and moral\u000a      responsibility. (See corroboration [2], [8]).\u000a    Vierkant became a key member of this working group, and also participated\u000a      in related activities. For example, he participated in the organisation of\u000a      a Church of Scotland conference on the topic of neuroscience and ethics,\u000a      entitled, `It Wasn't Me, It Was My Neurons', which took place in 2011.\u000a      Vierkant was asked to write roughly half of the group's report,\u000a      `Neurobiology, Free Will and Moral Responsibility'. Vierkant also helped\u000a      formulate the report's recommendations to the Church of Scotland. In\u000a      particular, he played an important role in formulating two specific\u000a      recommendations. First, that the Church of Scotland should recognise that\u000a      the implications of contemporary neuroscience for free will and moral\u000a      responsibility are more complex than sometimes supposed (in the sense that\u000a      contemporary neuroscience on the one hand does not pose any direct\u000a      challenge to free will and moral responsibility, but on the other hand\u000a      does call for a re-evaluation of traditional philosophical concepts like\u000a      autonomy). Second, that the Church of Scotland should accordingly play an\u000a      active and on-going role in exploring these implications. Vierkant's\u000a      contribution to this report drew heavily on his research in this area,\u000a      particularly Vierkant (2005; 2007, 2008), but also Vierkant (2011, 2012,\u000a      2013). (See corroboration [3], [4], [8]).\u000a    This report was widely disseminated, including being made freely\u000a      available on the Church of Scotland's website and informing a widely\u000a      available Church of Scotland leaflet on Neurobiology. It was also\u000a      submitted to the Church of Scotland's General Assembly in 2012 where it\u000a      was discussed and, crucially, all of its recommendations approved. For\u000a      each report from a working group there is a series of resolutions (known\u000a      as `deliverances') for commissioners at the General Assembly to accept,\u000a      reject, add to or amend. During the General Assembly, council and\u000a      committee conveners present reports from the working groups to\u000a      commissioners for debate. Decisions agreed become `law' which means that\u000a      they determine how the Church of Scotland operates. It is precisely in\u000a      this sense that the recommendations set out in the Society, Religion and\u000a      Technology working group's report, substantially authored by Vierkant\u000a      (both as a whole, and as regards its recommendations), have now become\u000a      part of the Church of Scotland's official policy. In particular, these\u000a      recommendations have been integrated into the Church of Scotland's 2012\u000a      `Blue Book', which contains the laws and policies of the Church. (See\u000a      corroboration [5], [6], [7], [8]).\u000a    It was the quality of Vierkant's research, and his willingness to engage\u000a      with relevant non-academic partners, which led to this work being deemed\u000a      relevant to the Church of Scotland's Society, Religion and Technology\u000a      working group. Vierkant's research then informed a significant part of the\u000a      report produced by this working group for the Church of Scotland's General\u000a      Assembly. Finally, by approving the recommendations made in this report,\u000a      and incorporating these recommendations into the laws and policies of the\u000a      Church, Vierkant's research has had an impact on the laws and policies of\u000a      a large socially important non-academic body.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Vierkant has produced a distinctive body of work that explores the\u000a      implications of contemporary neuroscience for the notions of free\u000a        will and moral responsibility.

To take two\u000a      prominent examples, the work of the neurophysiologist Benjamin Libet and\u000a      the social psychologist Daniel Wegner has been interpreted as showing that\u000a      the conscious self is nothing but an illusion and that our actions are\u000a      really fully controlled by `zombie' (i.e. unconscious) mechanisms. If it\u000a      is true that free will is an illusion, then this has profound\u000a      philosophical implications. For example, standard conceptions of moral\u000a      responsibility presuppose that moral agents are free, so if free will is\u000a      an illusion then so too, potentially, is the very idea that a subject can\u000a      be held morally responsible for her actions.\u000a    In a key thread of his research conducted over the last decade, Vierkant\u000a      (2005; 2007; 2008; 2011; 2012; 2013) has clarified the kinds of threats\u000a      posed to our conception of ourselves as free (and thus morally\u000a      responsible) agents by this scientific work. In particular, he argues that\u000a      while there is indeed a prima facie challenge in play here, the\u000a      real threat posed by this work is often misunderstood. For example, it is\u000a      often argued that these experiments show that we cannot be free, because\u000a      they demonstrate that our brains determine what we do. Vierkant (2007;\u000a      2008; 2013) claims that this line of argument is a red herring, because it\u000a      ignores the possibilityf8e7widely defended within philosophyf8e7that\u000a      determinism and free will are compatible. Vierkant (2013) further argues,\u000a      however, that there is a perfectly rational explanation for why the\u000a      science is perceived as threatening the possibility of free will. This is\u000a      because it is often portrayed as generating predictions of behaviour that\u000a      always come out true, independent of the choices of the subject. Portrayed\u000a      in this way, these scientific predictions appear to render the choices of\u000a      the conscious subject powerless. If these portrayals were accurate, then\u000a      it would indeed be rational to be fatalistic, in that free will would be\u000a      an illusion. By looking more closely at the experiments, Vierkant shows\u000a      that these portrayals are false. Indeed, conceptual analysis reveals that\u000a      this kind of prediction might even be metaphysically implausible.\u000a    More positively, Vierkant's (2005; 2007; 2008; 2011; 2012; 2013) research\u000a      also involves showing that while the challenges for free will routinely\u000a      portrayed from these scientific results is illusory, there is an\u000a      underlying challenge that is entirely genuine. This consists in the fact\u000a      that our picture of the autonomous, rational agent that underpins the\u000a      ordinary notion of free will and agential responsibility is demonstrated\u000a      by these results to be problematic, and is thus in need of substantial\u000a      amendment. It follows that contemporary neuroscience and social psychology\u000a      do have important implications for free will and thus moral\u000a      responsibility, albeit not quite the implications that are often reported.\u000a    Vierkant's research on these topics was also important to his role in two\u000a      large collaborative research grant projects with which he was involved\u000a      between 2006 and 2010, both of which have been judged to have been\u000a      successfully completed by the funding bodies concerned (see `grants'\u000a      below).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24406","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Drug development, technological advancements and improved living\u000d      conditions have had a huge influence on the field of medicine and\u000d      healthcare practitioners. More than ever doctors need critical and\u000d      independent thought, empathy and understanding, and the ability to\u000d      communicate as they and their patients navigate the multitude of choices\u000d      now available from before conception to post-mortem examination.\u000d      Incorporating elements of the arts and humanities into the rigorous\u000d      discipline that is the study of medicine allows future doctors to gain\u000d      insight into the human conditions of illness and suffering, to sharpen\u000d      their powers of perception &#8212; of their professionalism and that of others\u000d      and of their responsibilities to self, colleagues and patients. Exposing\u000d      them to the arts and literature has been shown to develop their\u000d      observational skills, analytical reasoning, empathy and self-reflection.\u000d    Over 30 years of research initiated at UoG has led directly to:\u000d    &#8212; early recognition by the General Medical Council of the importance of\u000d      humanities elements as part of the medical curriculum for `tomorrow's\u000d      doctors';\u000d    &#8212; recognition by key agencies &#8212; including the Nuffield, Wellcome &#8212; of the\u000d      importance of the field and support for its development &#8212; eg, the journal\u000d      Medical Humanities was established with support from the British\u000d      Medical Association and first edited by Macnaughton to 2010); and the\u000d      Association of Medical Humanities was established with Nuffield support in\u000d      2002 `to promote the medical humanities in education, healthcare and\u000d      research in the UK and Ireland';\u000d    &#8212; the establishment of the first Centre of Medical Humanities at Durham\u000d      University, with a total of 24 such centres or units worldwide in 2013;\u000d    &#8212; thirty of the UK's 32 medical schools now offer medical humanities as\u000d      undergraduate modules or as postgraduate degree programmes &#8212; in 2013 the\u000d      majority of students in schools of medicine in the UK will have a\u000d      humanities component in their curriculum.\u000d    All of the above are continuing impacts, which have been ongoing\u000d      throughout the census period. The Special Study Modules first offered by\u000d      UoG and advocated by the General Medical Council are now an integral\u000d      curricular component, with the importance of medical humanities for\u000d      doctors and patients widely recognised. By 2010 the majority of the\u000d      medical schools in the UK had accepted this finding. Following on from the\u000d      success of the pioneering work at UoG and the establishment of the centre\u000d      at Durham, the Universities of Aberdeen, St Bartholomew's, Brighton and\u000d      Sussex, Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Exeter,\u000d      Hull-York Medical School, Keele, King's College London, Leeds, Leicester,\u000d      Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Oxford, Plymouth, Sheffield,\u000d      Southampton, St Andrews, University College London and Warwick all\u000d      subsequently opened Medical Humanities units offering a range of courses\u000d      from modules to postgraduate study. Between them, these institutions\u000d      represent about 80% of the undergraduate medical teaching offered in the\u000d      UK, meaning that the vast majority now incorporate a medical humanities\u000d      element to their teaching.\u000d    The NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde operate the Glasgow Medical\u000d      Humanities Unit in collaboration with the University of Glasgow &#8212; it was\u000d      the first unit of its kind in Scotland. In addition to the dedicated\u000d      centres, a number of institutions have gone beyond the offering of the\u000d      Glasgow-model SSMs to provide intercalated and postgraduate masters'\u000d      degrees.\u000d    In his capacity as former Chief Medical Officer for the UK and Scotland,\u000d      Professor Sir Kenneth Calman writes:\u000d    It is relevant to reflect on the impact the studies in Glasgow had on the\u000d      wider medical community. Medical education and practice has always been\u000d      based on a broad range of values, and had a strong ethical component. The\u000d      work in Glasgow on the medical humanities provided an important new focus\u000d      and impetus for considering medicine from the point of the patient, and in\u000d      ensuring that the ethical values were maintained. The initiative came at\u000d      just the right time and [...] began to feature in educational programmes\u000d      in ethics, palliative care, discussions on quality of life, care of the\u000d      elderly and public health challenges. Each of these benefitted from\u000d      viewing the subject from a different angle, and this had consequences in\u000d      clinical practice and patient well-being. It provided a catalyst for new\u000d      thinking and bringing together people from different backgrounds and\u000d      interests all focussed on improving patient care.\u000d    UoG's Centre for Medical Humanities focuses on the healing environment\u000d      and the role of visual arts in improving the experience of patients. In\u000d      2009 funding was obtained from the Scottish Arts Council (now Creative\u000d      Scotland) to develop the centre's work with participation by visiting\u000d      artists. The result was the establishment of an SSM entitled `Framework\u000a        for healing: the arts, architecture and the doctor's working\u000d        environment'. In 2011 Creative Scotland funded teaching in an SSM on\u000d      `Medicine, the arts, and the doctor's way of seeing' and the `Creative\u000d      Space' was opened in Glasgow Western Infirmary, a collaboration between\u000d      the Medical Humanities Unit and NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde. The\u000d      Creative Space facilities an exhibition programme and arts events within a\u000d      healthcare context, with the aim of bring arts and health practitioners\u000d      together in an acute medical context.\u000d    As Brazil is seeking to incorporate a humanities strand into its\u000d      provision of medical education, Downie was interviewed in late 2012 by a\u000d      researcher from the Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (Paulista School of\u000d      Medicine) interested in learning about the development of the UoG model\u000d      and the successful implementation of Special Study Modules. The prolonged\u000d      consultation with Downie inspired the Brazilian university to develop\u000d      their `Laboratory of Humanities': `...it made our prolonged dreams become\u000d      solid research ideas become government sponsored grants. It also made us\u000d      less wary about trying to find reverberating voices [in Brazil] and to\u000d      rather develop our own way of configuring this as a new discipline within\u000d      Medical Schools in Brazil today.' The now-established Centre for the\u000d      History and Philosophy of the Health Sciences offers postgraduate degrees\u000d      and special modules for undergraduates, and an average of 50 participants\u000d      each week discussing literature and philosophy in their Laboratory of\u000d      Humanities, in much the same way that the original extra-curricular clubs\u000d      operated for medical students in Glasgow.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    The field of medicine has become more complex and morally demanding as it\u000d      faces the challenges of technological advances, changing social attitudes\u000d      and financial constraints, all dramatically highlighted in the recent\u000d      Francis Report. These challenges require a profession with independent\u000d      judgment and a willingness to listen to, and communicate humanely with,\u000d      patients. The complex skills required for this can be developed through\u000d      what have become known as the `medical humanities', or the application of\u000d      philosophy and other humanities to medical education.\u000d    This argument was first explored and tested in the UK by researchers at\u000d      the University of Glasgow (UoG), where the key actors in the UK medical\u000d      humanities movement worked together to articulate and trial humanities\u000d      content to students of medicine.\u000d    The impact this can have on medical practice has been recognised by the\u000d      General Medical Council, funding streams in the Wellcome Trust and other\u000d      major funding bodies, the Royal Colleges and NHS units.

The first critical\u000d      research into the value of the arts and humanities to the training,\u000d      mindset and understanding of future doctors, and the most effective\u000d      channels of delivery for these elements, was carried out at UoG through\u000d      the 1990s-2000s. Among the originators of the medical humanities movement\u000d      in the UK, each playing a unique role in its development and its\u000d      widespread adoption, were:\u000d    &#8212; Robin Downie (UoG: Professor of Moral Philosophy, 1969-2002; and,\u000d      Professorial Research Fellow 2002-);\u000d    &#8212; Sir Kenneth Calman (UoG: Professor of Oncology, 1974-84; and, Dean of\u000d      Postgraduate Medicine 1984-89. Later Chief Medical Officer for Scotland;\u000d      Chief Medical Officer UK; and, Vice-Chancellor of the University of\u000d      Durham. UoG: Chancellor, 2006-present); and,\u000d    &#8212; Jane Macnaughton (UoG: Lecturer in the School of Medicine's Department\u000d      of General Practice, 1995-2000. Later Director of UK's first Medical\u000d      Humanities Centre at University of Durham, under Calman's\u000d      vice-chancellorship).\u000d    The initial insights into the value of an arts education in the medical\u000d      curriculum were gained 1987-1995, pre-dating but continuing into the REF\u000d      Impact timeframe. After 1995 Downie and Calman built on successful\u000d      extra-curricular student clubs they had established that offered\u000d      discussions of literature, poems and the arts for students and staff in\u000d      UoG's then Faculty of Medicine: this was an entirely new concept at the\u000d      time. In 1991 Calman was appointed Chief Medical Officer for Her Majesty's\u000d      Government and was in a position to use UoG research to influence thinking\u000d      at the General Medical Council (GMC). Following his intervention, the GMC\u000d      incorporated a humanities element into their suggested medical curriculum\u000d      via Special Study Modules (SSMs) as they were called in the initial\u000d      version of Tomorrow's Doctors (1993): since 2003 they have been\u000d      called Student-Selected Components.\u000d    Between 1995 and 2000 Downie and Macnaughton focused their research on\u000d      the development of initial findings regarding the value of, and most\u000d      effective delivery channels for, humanities elements in medical education.\u000d      Downie and Calman had argued that students should be trained to be\u000d      interested in the patient as a whole &#8212; including being aware of his\/her\u000d      social context &#8212; rather than just disease symptoms. This training requires\u000d      attention to values and to the language of communication, which are skills\u000d      central to the humanities. In order to investigate this further, Downie\u000d      and Macnaughton offered a Special Studies Module in Philosophy in which\u000d      second-year medical students attended a course normally taken by\u000d      philosophy students. The medical students spent five weeks studying\u000d      Plato's `Republic' and attending lectures on political philosophy. These\u000d      lectures were not tailored to medical students but instead were aimed at\u000d      bringing them into a very different academic field and culture, training\u000d      them to apply philosophical analysis in their approach to an argument. The\u000d      researchers found that this approach was effective in enabling medical\u000d      students to assess the strength of an argument and to question received\u000d      wisdom. In their evaluations, the successive cohorts of medical students\u000d      claimed that they had developed skills enabling them to assess claims &#8212;\u000d      eg, made by pharmaceutical companies &#8212; and had also gained a greater\u000d      understanding of the moral values underpinning the society in which they\u000d      were to practise.\u000d    Macnaughton conducted further research at UoG, supervised by Downie, on\u000d      the value of the humanities in informing and guiding clinical judgement.\u000d      This led to her PhD in 1998, and subsequently to a book jointly written by\u000d      Downie and Macnaughton entitled Clinical Judgement: Evidence in\u000d        Practice (OUP, 2000). The researchers argued that `good clinical\u000d      judgement requires both technical evidence and a humane attitude. [...] A\u000d      humane attitude involves ethical sensitivity, but also a broad educated\u000d      perspective which can be derived from the arts.' In other words, sound\u000d      clinical judgment requires more than a technical component, and the `more'\u000d      can be developed via the humanities.\u000d    During this period, through a combination of the ongoing research at UoG\u000d      and the continued support for medical humanities from Calman, the UoG\u000d      training model was gaining acceptance well beyond this HEI. In June 1996 a\u000d      commentary written by Calman and Downie was published in The Lancet:\u000d      `Why arts courses for medical curricula?' argued that the restructuring\u000d      that was taking place in medical curricula following new GMC guidelines\u000d      meant that there was a `modest slot [...] for the introduction of an\u000d      \"arts\" component via special study modules.' In December 1996 Calman\u000d      convened the first in a series of meetings, supported by the Nuffield\u000d      Foundation, to explore the benefits and challenges of incorporating\u000d      humanities into medical education.\u000d    In 1997 the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons at Glasgow (RCPS)\u000d      celebrated its 400th anniversary by hosting a medical\u000d      humanities conference, co-organised by Downie. This was the first\u000d      conference in the UK on the topic held by a Royal College. As part of the\u000d      RCPS celebrations the British Medical Journal, in conjunction with Downie,\u000d      organised a short story competition for doctors. This provided an\u000d      opportunity for doctors to articulate their experiences for a wider\u000d      readership, and encouraged the development of creative writing in medical\u000d      education.\u000d    By 2000 Calman had been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the University of\u000d      Durham. Collaboration with Downie and Macnaughton had continued\u000d      throughout, and at his instigation Macnaughton took on the inaugural\u000d      directorship of the UK's first centre for medical humanities at Durham in\u000d      2000. This Centre became one of two to gain strategic awards in Medical\u000d      Humanities from the Wellcome Trust in 2007.\u000d    Between 2000-07 Downie and Macnaughton continued to research the specific\u000d      benefits to medical education offered by the humanities and, in\u000d      particular, how ethics can be taught via the humanities. In parallel,\u000d      Downie and Fiona Randall (part-time researcher at Glasgow, 1999-2006; and,\u000d      NHS consultant in palliative medicine) also researched and developed a\u000d      programme around the use of philosophy as a tool to offer both a critique\u000d      and positive suggestions for the speciality of palliative medicine.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24959","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Art is such a contested area in our culture that the term is extremely\u000d\u000a      difficult to define.\u000d\u000a      Developments in art since the early 20th century have made the issue\u000d\u000a      particularly problematic.\u000d\u000a      Matravers' work on the subject rejects the view that institutional\u000d\u000a      definitions excuse the art world\u000d\u000a      from having to engage in reasoned discourse, making his work of interest\u000d\u000a      to members of the public\u000d\u000a      who engage with art and used by people within the art world.

The podcast has been used in\u000d\u000a      various educational\u000d\u000a      contexts (for example, on a wiki at Middle Tennessee State University and\u000d\u000a      an Academy in\u000d\u000a      Argentina) and is discussed in various blogs (for example, The\u000d\u000a        Wondering Kiwi and The Chaotic\u000d\u000a        Semiotic).\u000d\u000a    Furthermore, the transcript of the talk was one of 25 published in\u000d\u000a      PhilosophyBites (OUP, 2010).\u000d\u000a      This book aims to bring interviews with leading philosophers to a general\u000d\u000a      audience: to date, it has\u000d\u000a      sold more than 12,000 copies. In a review in The Guardian, the\u000d\u000a      book was described as `an\u000d\u000a      excellent sampler of key philosophical issues'.\u000d\u000a    Matravers has also published an introduction to the philosophy of art,\u000d\u000a      including a discussion of his\u000d\u000a      views on the definition of art, which is aimed at the general public and,\u000d\u000a      specifically, at interested\u000d\u000a      members of the art world (The Philosophy of Art: An Introduction with\u000d\u000a        Eight Examples, Acumen,\u000d\u000a      2013). The book is carried by art gallery bookshops; Tate Modern, for\u000d\u000a      example. Although it is too\u000d\u000a      early to get meaningful sales figures, the book has already led to\u000d\u000a      invitations to give talks on the\u000d\u000a      book: first, to the Oxford University Continuing Education Department and\u000d\u000a      second, to students at\u000d\u000a      Hills Road VIth Form College.\u000d\u000a    Matravers' discussions with the artist Alana Jelinek (artist in residence\u000d\u000a      at the Museum of\u000d\u000a      Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge) have contributed directly to\u000d\u000a      her work. In particular,\u000d\u000a      he worked with her on a conceptual art piece, `Not praising, burying', in\u000d\u000a      which ten academics and\u000d\u000a      artists painted pots and discussed the nature and value of art. The event\u000d\u000a      was held in the\u000d\u000a      Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge on 2 November 2012. The work was performed\u000d\u000a      in private,\u000d\u000a      although a record of it is publicly available (problematising the ontology\u000d\u000a      of artworks being part of\u000d\u000a      the point of the work). A follow up discussion took place on 8 November in\u000d\u000a      front of a public\u000d\u000a      audience of about 40 people. Jelinek has said that:\u000d\u000a    \"This is Not Art: activism and other not-art' (2013) [her book] and the\u000d\u000a      artworks, `Not\u000d\u000a      Praising, Burying' (2012) and `The Field' (2009-ongoing) in particular\u000d\u000a      have been an attempt\u000d\u000a      to introduce the ideas of Derek Matravers to the contemporary art world\u000d\u000a      and engage with\u000d\u000a      them critically within that context.'\u000d\u000a    Matravers has been invited to continue this in a paper to be published in\u000d\u000a      the fine art journal, The\u000d\u000a        Journal of Visual Arts Practice.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Derek Matravers' research in aesthetics has contributed to the public\u000d\u000a      discourse on art by offering a\u000d\u000a      plausible postmodern definition of `art'.

The dominant philosophical\u000d\u000a      answer is some version of\u000d\u000a      George Dickie's `Institutional Theory'. This holds that something is art\u000d\u000a      if and only if it stands in the\u000d\u000a      right relation to some social practice: the art world (Art and the\u000d\u000a        Aesthetic, Cornell University Press).\u000d\u000a      An approximation to the theory is that something is art if the right kind\u000d\u000a      of person puts it forward as\u000d\u000a      art. However, this theory is widely thought to suffer from a fatal\u000d\u000a      dilemma: either the person putting\u000d\u000a      the object forward has reasons for doing so, or they do not. If they do,\u000d\u000a      then those reasons can form\u000d\u000a      the basis for a definition of art. If they do not, then all we are left\u000d\u000a      with is an arbitrary collection: a\u000d\u000a      collection of objects for no reason at all.\u000d\u000a    Matravers' research into the definition of art spans a decade and emerged\u000d\u000a      from his interest in the\u000d\u000a      `crisis of legitimacy' in the arts, grounded in the rejection of the need\u000d\u000a      to provide reasons by some of\u000d\u000a      the art world. His insight was that the dilemma could be answered by\u000d\u000a      pointing out a scope\u000d\u000a      ambiguity: although there is no reason such that everything that is put\u000d\u000a      forward is put forward for\u000d\u000a      that reason, it is nonetheless the case that, for everything that has been\u000d\u000a      put forward, it has been\u000d\u000a      put forward for a reason. This is a much more interesting and defensible\u000d\u000a      version of the Institutional\u000d\u000a      Theory.\u000d\u000a    Recently, Berys Gaut has produced a further attempt to elucidate the\u000d\u000a      concept of art (`\"Art\" as a\u000d\u000a      Cluster Concept' in Theories of Art Today (ed.) Noel Carroll,\u000d\u000a      University of Wisconsin Press, pp.\u000d\u000a      25-44). Gaut claims that `art' is a `cluster concept': there is a list of\u000d\u000a      conditions that make something\u000d\u000a      art. One of these (that the object is an artefact) is necessary, and (in\u000d\u000a      particular cases) some\u000d\u000a      number will be sufficient for something to be art. Matravers has argued\u000d\u000a      that this attempt fails for a\u000d\u000a      number of reasons. However, using the earlier research, it can be shown\u000d\u000a      that Gaut's insights can\u000d\u000a      be combined with an Institutional Theory to show that it is a mistake to\u000d\u000a      think that the Institutional\u000d\u000a      Theory can excuse those working in the art world from any need to justify\u000d\u000a      their practices.\u000d\u000a    Matravers' demonstration that accounts of art cannot avoid reason-giving\u000d\u000a      opens the opportunity for\u000d\u000a      debate about what is and what is not art, and why. Public scepticism about\u000d\u000a      much contemporary art\u000d\u000a      (that it is obscure and self-serving) should be answered with debate about\u000d\u000a      the nature and value of\u000d\u000a      art, and the nature and value of particular purported works of art.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24967","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Chappell's engagement with a diverse range of non-academic and academic\u000a      audiences has\u000a      resulted in his research influencing and challenging healthcare\u000a      professionals in the NHS to\u000a      providing the impetus for an interdisciplinary approach to religious\u000a      studies in Latin America.\u000a    As Director of the OU Ethics Centre, he seeks out opportunities to\u000a      challenge and expand thinking\u000a      about ethics, both in the UK and internationally.

In June 2009 he presented the research that became `On the Very\u000a      Idea of Criteria for\u000a      Personhood' (Chappell 2011a) in a `Grand Round' talk at Northampton\u000a      General Hospital; this drew\u000a      a very positive response from an audience of several hundred healthcare\u000a      professionals. This\u000a      presentation was part of a continuing working relationship between\u000a      Chappell and a consultant\u000a      paediatrician at Northampton General Hospital, who said of the talk:\u000a      `Professor Chappell used the\u000a      lecture not only to demonstrate the necessity of having a meaningful\u000a      philosophical structure to\u000a      underpin how one lives one's life, but also particularly within the\u000a      challenging context of health care,\u000a      of making decisions and living with the decisions you have to make.'\u000a    Over the last five years Chappell and this paediatrician have cooperated\u000a      on a number of projects.\u000a      The consultant is the author of several dramas on medical themes, on which\u000a      Chappell has worked\u000a      as an informal ethical advisor.

A full\u000a      presentation of the programme is in his forthcoming monograph Knowing\u000a        What To Do: Virtue,\u000a        Imagination, and Platonism in Ethics (OUP, 2014).\u000a    Chappell argues that the kind of virtue ethics derivable from Plato and\u000a      Aristotle constitutes an\u000a      ethical outlook rather than a systematic moral theory (2009a).\u000a      Plato was engaged, and Aristotle to\u000a      some degree succeeded (2009b), in articulating an understanding of the\u000a      ethical role of the\u000a      imagination and the passions. Aristotle was officially interested, and\u000a      Plato unofficially, in how these\u000a      passions, as educated by the virtues, were expressed in (for example)\u000a      poetry and tragedy.\u000a    These interests gave Plato and Aristotle significant advantages over some\u000a      contemporary moral\u000a      theorists. Three particular ways in which academic moral theory today can\u000a      easily disconnect itself\u000a      from extra-academic reality are (1) lack of imagination, (2) professed\u000a      value-neutrality, and\u000a      (3) insensitivity to the character of actual ethical experience.\u000a    These are general flaws and Chappell's research diagnoses their presence\u000a      in a number of\u000a      contexts (see 2011b). As far back as 1997, Chappell suggested that\u000a      philosophers might fruitfully\u000a      take a more explicitly value-laden approach to personal identity. Chappell\u000a      (2011a) now argues that\u000a      all three flaws are present in contemporary discussions of personhood.\u000a    Bioethicists now routinely assert that counting as a person simply means\u000a      meeting some test or\u000a      criterion for personhood&#8212;rationality, sentience, emotionality, or the\u000a      like. They assume (1) that\u000a      there is no conceivable alternative to such criteria and no practical\u000a      problem about applying them,\u000a      (2) that `success' or `failure' in these tests is best judged from an\u000a      impersonal, value-neutral\u000a      standpoint, and (3) that any counter-intuitive consequences of the\u000a      application of such criteria for\u000a      personhood are to be toughed out as `sentimentality' or otherwise\u000a      irrational emotion.\u000a    Chappell (2011a) rejects all three assumptions.\u000a    (1) As soon as we apply our imaginations to thinking what it would be\u000a      like to actually judge\u000a      `candidate persons' by such criteria, the psychological unreality (and\u000a      inhumanity) of the procedure\u000a      becomes blatant. What we do in practice is take characteristics like\u000a      rationality and sentience not as\u000a      criteria for admission to the `persons club', but as dimensions\u000a        of interpretation of creatures that we\u000a      already take to be persons.\u000a    (2) Our actual engagement with other persons is neither value-neutral nor\u000a      impersonal. It is\u000a      essentially second-personal: it can be described with a useful pun as an\u000a      exercise of the\u000a      principle of charity.\u000a    (3) That our actual engagement with other persons is always an exercise\u000a      of compassion for each\u000a      other's essential vulnerability, given that we are all what MacIntyre\u000a      calls `dependent rational\u000a      animals' &#8212; this explains how (at our best) our intuitive response to\u000a      humans who are very young,\u000a      very disabled, very ill, or very unconscious is not to dismiss them as\u000a      `non-persons' because they\u000a      fail some armchair a priori test, but to embrace them as\u000a      fellow-mortals.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27164","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of this research takes three main forms.\u000a    \u000a      Increasing the ethical understanding of HIV health-workers and\u000a          policy-makers\u000a    \u000a    As a result of their publications, and presentations to exclusively\u000a      medical audiences (e.g. 5th International AIDs Conference, Durban, South\u000a      Africa, 2011), Allais and Venter's work has enhanced the ethical\u000a      understanding of HIV health-workers and policy-makers. Evidence of this\u000a      takes two forms.\u000a    \u000a      First, Allais was invited to participate in a closed World Health\u000a        Organisation meeting on HIV self-testing (`The Legal, Ethical, Gender,\u000a        Human Rights and Public Health Implications of HIV Self-Testing\u000a        Scale-up, Brocher Foundation, Geneva, 8-9 April 2013). The aim was to\u000a        see whether there is a broad consensus about going forward with\u000a        developing self-testing and scaling it up, and to identify research\u000a        questions, including ethical concerns, which need to be addressed. Fifty\u000a        doctors and academics, of whom Allais was the only philosopher, were\u000a        invited to develop ideas in discussion (rather than via papers). The\u000a        meeting jointly produced a consensus statement on the legal, ethical,\u000a        gender, human rights, and public health implications of HIV Self-Testing\u000a        scale-up, published in the wider `Report on the First International\u000a        Symposium on Self-Testing for HIV: The Legal, Ethical, Gender, Human\u000a        Rights and Public Health Implications' [see Section 5, C1], now\u000a        available on the WHO website. Following the meeting, Allais was invited\u000a        to submit for consideration to the journal AIDS and Behavior, an\u000a        abstract entitled `An evaluation of the ethical and human rights\u000a        considerations of HIV self-testing'. She was then invited to develop the\u000a        abstract into an article for publication as part of the March 2014\u000a        special edition of the journal on HIV self-testing. In addition, the\u000a        review panel suggested by email [C2] that she and Professor Anne Scott\u000a        (Head of the School of Nursing, Dublin City University) collaborate in\u000a        further bringing to light the ethical and human rights issues addressed\u000a        by the abstract.\u000a      Second, positive influence is attested in communications to the\u000a        Philosophy Department, following presentations of Allais and Venter's\u000a        work both on HIV status-ignorance (presented by Allais), and the\u000a        `concurrency' explanation (presented by Venter), at the Royal Sussex\u000a        County Hospital in Brighton in December 2012 [C3]. Several participants\u000a        commented on how what they had heard had informed them and caused them\u000a        to think differently about the issues. For instance: `It made me think\u000a        differently about a question that arose more than once afterwards, which\u000a        was whether some form of \"compulsory\" testing might compensate for the\u000a        increasing rates of STIs, HIV and unprotected sex. My immediate response\u000a        would have been negative, but especially the philosophical\u000a        presentation\/discussion and the narrative on the South African\u000a        experience made me think twice' (Chief Executive of HIV Scotland until\u000a        October 2011); and `What I found particularly useful was the integration\u000a        of philosophical considerations with multidisciplinary clinical research\u000a        disciplines... Particularly for me it brought to the fore the importance\u000a        of philosophical and ethical considerations' (Reader in Palliative Care,\u000a        King's College London). A researcher from the Tuke Institute attended\u000a        the event, and in October 2013 Dr Rupert Whitaker, co-founder of the\u000a        Terrence Higgins Trust and founder of the Tuke Institute, approached\u000a        Kathleen Stock with a view to organising a multi-disciplinary research\u000a        group on Rights and Responsibilities in HIV at Sussex, including\u000a        Philosophy.\u000a\u0009\u0009\u000a\u0009\u0009\u000a\u0009\u0009Positively influencing the design of a cholera drug trial\u000a    \u000a    Allais's work has led to her involvement in the design of a cholera drug\u000a      trial. Helen Rees, a doctor and vaccine expert at Witswaterand,\u000a      recommended Allais to the organiser of the trial at the Center for Vaccine\u000a      Ethics and Policy at NYU\/Wistar Institute\/CHOP on the basis of Allais'\u000a      research. Allais was invited to comment on the trial and her comments are\u000a      reproduced in their entirety (pp. 51-53) in the White Paper which followed\u000a      [C4]. Her comments concerned the use of a placebo in the trial, whether\u000a      informed consent would be achieved from socio-economically deprived\u000a      participants, the compensation of any harm resulting from the trial, the\u000a      need for community involvement in it, and the training that would be given\u000a      to the research ethics committee. Correspondence from the Center's\u000a      Director [C5] attests that `This consultation was complex insofar as it\u000a      was proposed to be conducted in a country where the vaccine in question\u000a      was already licensed, and was already WHO pre-qualified as a two-dose\u000a      regimen.

She was\u000a        subsequently interviewed for radio and primetime TV news slots.\u000a        According to media monitoring services at the University of\u000a        Witswaterand, the debate generated exposure of about R 230,650 (&#163;14,120)\u000a        in Advertising Value Equivalency (AVE), and an estimated PR value of R\u000a        922,600 (&#163;5,638,315).

In connection with her Kantian background, she has\u000a      developed an interest in ethics [see Section 3, R1], and particularly\u000a      matters related to notions of personal autonomy, personhood, and rights,\u000a      as they pertain to healthcare and disease transmission. Her work on the\u000a      sexual ethics of disease transmission and of mandatory testing stems from\u000a      this interest, since each raises questions about its relationship to the\u000a      infringement of one's own and others' rights, and the exercise of personal\u000a      autonomy. With Dr Francois Venter, a former President for the Southern\u000a      African HIV Clinicians' Society, she has co-authored two articles, which\u000a      are the underpinning research for this study. [R2, R3]\u000a    In `HIV, logic and sex' [R2], Allais and Venter identify two problems\u000a      with the widely accepted explanation of the dramatically high rates of HIV\u000a      infection in sub-Saharan Africa: that HIV prevalence is due to a\u000a      supposedly distinct model of sexual partnering referred to as `multiple\u000a      concurrent partnerships' or `concurrency', common in the region. They\u000a      argue that the `concurrency' explanation does not contribute to\u000a      understanding the unusual rates of HIV infection in the region; that there\u000a      is no single `concurrency hypothesis', and that the term `concurrency' is\u000a      imprecise and does not pick out one distinct form of sexual behaviour, so\u000a      is not explanatorily useful.\u000a    In `Exposure ethics: does HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis raise ethical\u000a      problems for the health care provider and policy maker?' [R3], Allais and\u000a      Venter argue that, contrary to widespread opinion within the medical\u000a      profession, the development of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) does\u000a      not raise new ethical concerns. They suggest that some of the questions\u000a      posed by PrEP are not specific to HIV prophylaxis, but are simply standard\u000a      public-health considerations about resource allocation and striking a\u000a      balance between individual benefit and public good. They consider sexual\u000a      disinhibition in the context of private prescriptions, and conclude that\u000a      only unjustified HIV-exceptionalism (treating HIV as different, in moral\u000a      terms, from other infectious diseases) or inappropriate moralism about sex\u000a      supports the thinking that PrEP raises new ethical problems. This negative\u000a      conclusion is significant in a context where supposedly ethical concerns\u000a      about PrEP have been raised, and in the context of HIV exceptionalism.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27169","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    \u000a      Building relationships with schools to improve teaching and\u000a            learning\u000a    Since 2003, we have alternated biannually between holding conferences for\u000a      Philosophy teachers and for sixth-form Philosophy and Religious Studies\u000a      students.

To the question `What did you find the most useful about the\u000a      conference today?' there was acknowledgement of the extent to which the\u000a      talks had increased comprehension, in answers such as\u000a    \u000a      `...the challenge to my own conceptions about materialism and\u000a        physicalism' [see Section 5, C1];\u000a      `The Philosophy of Mind and Political Philosophy were particularly\u000a        useful' [C1];\u000a      `The mind-body talk on Physicalism and Materialism will be essential\u000a        to my teaching of the life-after-death topic, and it corrects my major\u000a        misconception of materialism' [C1];\u000a      `Consideration of the anti-individualism\/individualism distinction in\u000a        relation to the claim (e.g. Searle's) that non-reductive monist theories\u000a        need not entail property dualism [C1];\u000a      `Philosophy of mind &#8212; a deeper analysis of token identity theory and\u000a        also other property dualist views than just the very basic, broad\u000a        argument' [C1].\u000a    \u000a    Inspiring the production of new teaching materials\u000a    Feedback also showed that the papers would make a difference to the\u000a      future production of teaching resources:\u000a    \u000a      `I will use the definitions of materialism and physicalism given to\u000a        help show a distinction between views' [C1];\u000a      `Lectures 4 and 5 (for example) would make an ideal pairing for two\u000a        consecutive lessons on \"autonomy\".

The strategy of the Department is to ensure that\u000a      research relates to teaching interests in a way that is accessible and not\u000a      too esoteric.

In her 2012 talk, `Autonomy and\u000a        the \"permanent interests of man\": Kant vs Mill', she focused on freedom\u000a        of expression in order to relate to the curriculum material on\u000a        toleration. She explored justification for ethical questions and, in\u000a        particular, Mill's use of the idea of the permanent interests of man,\u000a        and Kant's notion of autonomy [see Section 3, R1].\u000a      Morris's `Akrasia in the Protagoras and the Republic' interprets Plato\u000a        as making a decisive move in the overall argument of the Republic\u000a        (a set text for both A-level and the IB). The move in question is\u000a        achieved by the argument in Republic IV in which Plato\u000a        distinguishes between three parts of the soul, to correspond to the\u000a        three classes of the city he has already identified. This argument\u000a        clearly conflicts with an argument to be found in the Protagoras,\u000a        whose purpose is to show that akrasia is impossible. The aim of his 2012\u000a        talk `Plato and Akrasia' was to use an analysis of the Protagoras\u000a        argument to raise focused questions about the interpretation of the Republic\u000a        argument [R2].\u000a      In `There is no viable notion of narrow content', Sawyer argues that a\u000a        false equation is often made, both in the philosophical literature and\u000a        in the Philosophy A-level curriculum, between two distinct positions in\u000a        the philosophy of mind: materialism and physicalism.

The report was particularly\u000d\u000a      opportune, as flood insurance policy is currently under review by the\u000d\u000a      Department for Environment Food &amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA), with their\u000d\u000a      initial 2011 report `Flood Risk and Insurance: A Roadmap to 2013 and\u000d\u000a      Beyond' arguing for a free market in flood insurance that is fully\u000d\u000a      sensitive to risks of flooding. This position was criticised by John\u000d\u000a      O'Neill and Martin O'Neill in their JRF report [A] that the JRF noted \"is\u000a        important as it is a clear example of where social justice\u000d\u000a        considerations need to be taken into consideration in policy development\u000d\u000a        in light of climate change and where the issues need addressing\u000d\u000a        together\" [1].\u000d\u000a    The JRF report was the first to systematically examine underlying\u000d\u000a      principles of justice that could be invoked in the justification of\u000d\u000a      different insurance regimes. This was integrated into a detailed\u000d\u000a      discussion of the existing distribution of flood insurance, alongside\u000d\u000a      international comparisons of different insurance systems. Earlier versions\u000d\u000a      of the report were commented on by key players in the debates, in\u000d\u000a      particular the National Flood Forum (NFF), the Morpeth Flood Action Group\u000d\u000a      (MFAG) and the Association of British Insurers (ABI). The latter noted\u000d\u000a      that the report \"helped a variety of stakeholders (insurers, community\u000d\u000a        groups etc.) elucidate their feelings about what is the `right approach'\u000d\u000a        to dealing with catastrophic flood risk in the UK, in a professional and\u000d\u000a        credible way. The thorough discussion of different concepts of\u000d\u000a        `fairness', has provided proponents of `pooling solutions', such as the\u000d\u000a        ABI, with reassurance that they are making the right arguments and\u000d\u000a        chasing the right solutions to what is a very difficult and emotive\u000d\u000a        problem... The JRF report was, and continues to be, a very helpful and\u000d\u000a        timely piece of work for the ABI internally... [I]t is always reassuring\u000d\u000a        to know that the principles of a policy proposal have credible academic\u000d\u000a        backing\" [2].\u000d\u000a    At the time the JRF report was published, those speaking on behalf of\u000d\u000a      flooded communities, such as NFF and MFAG, were together with the ABI\u000d\u000a      arguing for different versions of more solidaristic schemes, as against\u000d\u000a      the free market position that was emerging from DEFRA. The JRF report was\u000d\u000a      launched (after DEFRA's report) to the NFF conference `Insurance,\u000d\u000a      Communities, Flood Risk: What Will the Future Hold?' (7th March\u000d\u000a      2012). As JRF confirm, alongside representatives from the insurance\u000d\u000a      industry, \"the event was attended by Defra Minister Richard Benyon,\u000d\u000a        Shadow Minister Gavin Shuker and Liberal Democrat Stephen Gilbert. All\u000d\u000a        were made aware of the report, Gavin Shuker endorsed it and the Minister\u000d\u000a        promised to follow up on it\" [1]. As the NFF Chief Executive\u000d\u000a      explains: \"The launch of the report at the National Flood Forum\u000d\u000a        conference was timely... [It] provided an explicit dimension,\u000d\u000a        social justice, that lies at the heart of the concept of insurance, but\u000d\u000a        which is rarely articulated. The portrayal of different aspects of\u000d\u000a        social justice allowed people to better understand some of its\u000d\u000a        complexity, but also to consider what insurance is for and how the\u000d\u000a        different models address this. The report also demonstrated to\u000d\u000a        Government that there was an academic underpinning to the views of\u000d\u000a        stakeholders... [S]ocial justice has been at the heart of the debate\u000d\u000a        over the last year, with ministers repeatedly asserting that they wish\u000d\u000a        to put in place something rather better than the existing Statement of\u000d\u000a        Principle, so this work has been particularly influential in supporting\u000d\u000a        the debate.\" The research enabled the NFF to develop a `consensus\u000d\u000a      note, delivered to DEFRA in March 2013. Commenting on the JRF report, the\u000d\u000a      NFF chairman noted that: \"whatever the new [Secretary of State] eventually\u000d\u000a        decides, I am convinced that this had a significant impact on the policy\u000d\u000a        makers\" [3].\u000d\u000a    During the period March 2012-June 2013, John O'Neill and Martin O'Neill\u000d\u000a      have been in ongoing discussions about the future of insurance policy with\u000d\u000a      MFAG and JRF. As the JRF programme manager verifies: \"The JRF raised\u000d\u000a        the issues at a national coastal erosion and flood risk management forum\u000d\u000a        convened by Defra and the EA and subsequently the JRF and research team\u000d\u000a        were invited to discussions with Defra, HMT and other stakeholders\u000d\u000a      [including NFF and ABI] about the issue to share perspectives as part\u000d\u000a        of policy development\" [1]. Meetings were also held with the Labour\u000d\u000a      Party's shadow ministerial team, with Gavin Shukar MP (Shadow Minister for\u000d\u000a      Water and Waste) making a number of references to the JRF report\u000d\u000a      influencing Labour Party policy on the future of flood insurance. He\u000d\u000a      notes: \"Leaving this issue to the free market ducks the challenge of\u000d\u000a        fairness and equity. It is simply untenable to leave homes and\u000d\u000a        businesses to unfettered risk from flooding. This issue of fairness\u000d\u000a        ...is one made well by Martin O'Neill and John O'Neill... They make the\u000d\u000a        case for a government as an arbiter of fairness in determining a\u000d\u000a        societal view of flood risk [4].\u000d\u000a    The JRF report continued to have a significant impact on discussions\u000d\u000a      between DEFRA, H.M. Treasury, the insurance industry and the major flood\u000d\u000a      action groups. Indeed, MFAG testimony &#8212; from a meeting between the NFF and\u000d\u000a      the ABI &#8212; noted: \"It was agreed that the JRF report has altered the\u000d\u000a        playing field. Defra and HMT are only too aware of this\" [5]. The\u000d\u000a      report was also successful in influencing wider debates around climate\u000d\u000a      justice, appearing in a Guardian newspaper article that quoted the NFF\u000d\u000a      Chairman's assertion that the JRF report \"gives overwhelming weight to\u000d\u000a        the case for government to step up to the plate to ensure that the\u000d\u000a        market in flood insurance is fair and equitable. On present evidence\u000d\u000a        they need to do more\" [6]. As he subsequently elucidated, the work\u000d\u000a      was vital in shaping the debate at a pivotal moment during 2012, assisting\u000d\u000a      the NFF \"by developing the intellectual argument for social justice in\u000d\u000a        flood insurance &#8212; something we believed to be true but could not have\u000d\u000a        presented in the way [the report] did\" [3]. Longer pieces\u000d\u000a      have also appeared in specialist magazines, such as Energy &amp;\u000d\u000a        Environmental Management [6].\u000d\u000a    In June 2013, DEFRA announced a new agreement that \"after\u000d\u000a        negotiations with the Association of British Insurers (ABI)... replaces\u000d\u000a        the current `Statement of Principles' that runs out at the end of July\u000d\u000a        and will bring peace of mind to people who will soon need to renew their\u000d\u000a        insurance. The new agreement will cap flood insurance premiums, linking\u000d\u000a        them to council tax bands so that people will know the maximum they will\u000d\u000a        have to pay. To fund this, a new industry-backed levy will enable\u000d\u000a        insurance companies to cover those at most risk of flooding. All UK\u000d\u000a        household insurers will have to pay into this pool, creating a fund that\u000d\u000a        can be used to pay claims for people in high-risk homes.\" [7]. The\u000d\u000a      new agreement is a compromise document which in the short term rules out a\u000d\u000a      fully risk sensitive market in insurance and introduces a form of\u000d\u000a      cross-subsidy from low to high risk households. The NFF chief executive\u000d\u000a      was cautiously optimistic: \"What we don't have are answers to the\u000d\u000a        impact on households, and how affordable and accessible this scheme will\u000d\u000a        be for people, and whether it protects those who are vulnerable...\u000d\u000a        However, this is the preferred approach because it actually does what\u000d\u000a        insurance is supposed to do, which is providing cover for everybody and\u000d\u000a        sharing risk between them, whereas other models didn't do this\" [8]\u000d\u000a      However, the government has retained its view that in the longer term\u000d\u000a      policy should shift towards a market-based approach that is fully-risk\u000d\u000a      sensitive. Ongoing work by John O'Neill and Martin O'Neill continues to\u000d\u000a      influence the development of JRF's critical response to this aspect of the\u000d\u000a      new agreement, in particular through the Government's own consultation on\u000d\u000a      the policy and related draft flood insurance clauses in the new Water Bill\u000d\u000a      2013-2014 (HC Bill 82).\u000d\u000a    Additional impacts have followed around biodiversity protection and\u000d\u000a        environmental compensation. Internal reports for EJOLT have dealt\u000d\u000a      with questions concerning the consistency of NGO critiques of the monetary\u000d\u000a      valuation of environmental goods in the context of both cost-benefit\u000d\u000a      analyses, and the acceptance of monetary damages in legal compensation\u000d\u000a      cases. O'Neill's contribution considered a legal case against Texaco in\u000d\u000a      Ecuador, arguing that contrary to some economic theories, the two\u000d\u000a      attitudes present &#8212; forward-looking cases of cost-benefit analysis, and\u000d\u000a      backward-looking cases involving compensatory justice &#8212; are consistent.\u000d\u000a      This has informed several NGOs.

This research\u000d\u000a      considered the relationship between the work of Neurath in the socialist\u000d\u000a      calculation debates, and its subsequent role in the development of\u000d\u000a      arguments within the tradition of ecological economics concerning the\u000d\u000a      limits of market modes of governance for the valuation of environmental\u000d\u000a      goods [C][F]. The programme of research continued when O'Neill was\u000d\u000a      appointed as Hallsworth Professor in 2005, and has led to further\u000d\u000a      publications, including more general critical responses to economic\u000d\u000a      defences of markets in the environmental sphere [B][D][E]. A number of\u000d\u000a        European projects on the market valuation of environmental goods have\u000d\u000a        also been undertaken during this time. O'Neill, Scott and Knights\u000d\u000a      are currently involved in a major European project that considers the\u000d\u000a      limits of economic valuation in biodiversity policy, and the defensibility\u000d\u000a      of emerging biodiversity off-set markets &#8212; `Motivational Strength of\u000d\u000a      Ecosystem Services and Alternative Ways to Express the Value of\u000d\u000a      Biodiversity' (BIOMOT, 2011-2015, &#8364;490,000). Additionally, O'Neill is a\u000d\u000a      partner in the EU `Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and\u000d\u000a      Trade' (EJOLT) project, which brings together academics alongside global\u000d\u000a      NGOs and civil society actors working on environmental justice,\u000d\u000a      liabilities and trade. For EJOLT, O'Neill has composed an internal\u000d\u000a      discussion document on the role of monetary valuation in the distinct\u000d\u000a      contexts of cost-benefit analysis and compensation cases for environmental\u000d\u000a      damage.\u000d\u000a    Policy Application: Recent research has achieved direct policy\u000d\u000a      impact, with the most significant project `Climate Change, Insurance and\u000d\u000a      Social Justice' (2011), funded by JRF. Within the final report the\u000d\u000a      limitations of markets for climate change policy was considered. Existent\u000d\u000a      work on the use of market based forms of governance in climate change\u000d\u000a      policy has been largely concerned with the use of emissions trading\u000d\u000a      schemes for climate mitigation. In contrast, this project considered\u000d\u000a      adaptation policy, in particular the use of insurance markets in climate\u000d\u000a      adaptation. The recent literature on the future of flood insurance is\u000d\u000a      dominated by economic arguments for market-based insurance policy, which\u000d\u000a      claim that differentiating premiums by risk is both fairer and more\u000d\u000a      efficient. Against this view, the final report `Social Justice and the\u000d\u000a        Future of Flood Insurance' defended a more solidaristic approach in\u000d\u000a        which those at lower risk support those who suffer from higher risk.\u000d\u000a      [A]\u000d\u000a    Through a consideration of underlying principles of justice, the report\u000d\u000a      provided a distinctive contribution to debates about the future of flood\u000d\u000a      insurance in the UK. This was especially timely as the current agreement\u000d\u000a      (the `Statement of Principles') between the Association of British\u000d\u000a      Insurers (ABI) and the UK Government is due to end in 2013. The report\u000d\u000a      contrasted two models for the future of insurance:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aindividualist, risk-sensitive insurance, provided through a\u000d\u000a        market in which individuals' payments are proportional to their level of\u000d\u000a        risk\u000d\u000a      \u000asolidaristic, risk-insensitive insurance, in which those at\u000d\u000a        lower risk contribute to the support of those at higher risk\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Against the view being developed in government documents, that\u000d\u000a      risk-sensitive insurance is both more efficient and fairer, the report\u000d\u000a      argued that justice required rather a more solidaristic approach. It\u000d\u000a      distinguished three different approaches to `fairness' in the provision of\u000d\u000a      flood insurance:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000apure actuarial fairness according to which insurance costs to\u000d\u000a        individuals should directly reflect their risk level\u000d\u000a      \u000achoice-sensitive fairness according to which insurance costs to\u000d\u000a        individuals should reflect only those risks that result from\u000d\u000a        each individual's choices\u000d\u000a      \u000afairness as social justice according to which insurance in the\u000d\u000a        provision of goods that are basic requirements of social justice should\u000d\u000a        be provided independently of individuals' risks and choices\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The report argued that `pure actuarial fairness' cannot provide a\u000d\u000a      compelling approach to flood insurance. It defended the `fairness as\u000d\u000a      social justice' approach, but it showed that neither this approach nor\u000d\u000a      `choice-sensitive fairness' could justify a free market in insurance that\u000d\u000a      was fully sensitive to risk. Both give good grounds for a more\u000d\u000a      solidaristic flood insurance regime.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28130","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Background: The JRF report developed a multi-dimensional\u000a      capabilities approach to well-being to take into account the social,\u000a      as well as the physical, personal and environmental factors that are\u000a      involved in the conversion of external stresses into losses in well-being.\u000a      In collaboration with colleagues from the Department of Geography (UoM),\u000a      these were incorporated into a detailed socio-spatial index of\u000a      vulnerability, which permits a thorough mapping and statistical analysis\u000a      of the distribution of climate disadvantage. This methodology permits an\u000a      approach to local and national mapping that grants policy makers not only\u000a      a sense of where the main concentrations of climate disadvantage are to be\u000a      found, but also more fine-grained information on what the specific sources\u000a      of disadvantage are in different locations. This is crucial, as different\u000a      locations require distinctive policy interventions, depending on the\u000a      specific local conversion factors at play.\u000a    Pathways: The JRF report was disseminated at a series of meetings\u000a      with national policy making bodies, local authorities, housing\u000a      organisations and civil society groups. As a result of subsequent uptake,\u000a      a range of actors are now able to better target adaptation strategies and\u000a      policies to the specific needs of different populations. The primary\u000a          impact of this research can therefore be charted at two\u000a      levels.\u000a    (1) Nations and Regions: At the UK level, results\u000a      were presented to the `Adaptation Sub-Committee' (ASC) to the Committee on\u000a      Climate Change meeting (London, 5th April 2011), with [A] then\u000a      utilised extensively within the ASC report (2011) that informed the `UK\u000a      Climate Change Risk Assessment' (2012). It states: \"Vulnerability is\u000a        also determined by the characteristics of local populations, including\u000a        age structure, income levels, education, health and mobility. A recent\u000a        study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has found that these\u000a        socio-economic characteristics can have a significant effect on the\u000a        inherent vulnerability of a local community to climate risks. For\u000a        example, the study found that the North West and Yorkshire had a higher\u000a        proportion of communities vulnerable to flood risk than the South East\".\u000a      The `Risk Assessment' also cites [A], as does a 2012 ASC report that\u000a      revisits [A], citing the finding that \"deprived communities...\u000a        generally have a lower capacity to prepare, respond and recover from\u000a        flood events\" [1].\u000a    In Wales a special meeting was organised with the Welsh\u000a      Government (Cardiff, 10th October 2011), with research outputs\u000a      being subsequently utilised internally to engage stakeholders (including\u000a      Ministers) around key principles, and moving to ensure that social\u000a      vulnerability and related justice issues were given appropriate\u000a      consideration in their activities. As the Welsh Government's knowledge\u000a      transfer advisor notes, the JRF report was \"particular[ly]\u000a        useful as this had a Welsh perspective and looked at a number of\u000a        different angles that I had not seen covered elsewhere e.g. deprivation\u000a        and access to services\" [2]. In Scotland, the work was\u000a      picked up by the ASC in their report to the Scottish Government.\u000a      Subsequently two meetings were held in Edinburgh (16th May\u000a      &amp; 12th September 2012) which acknowledged the potential to\u000a      transform the research into useful policy, encouraging SEPA to fund a\u000a      follow-on project, using additional SEPA datasets to map climate\u000a      disadvantage in Scotland. The Scottish Government's Principal Research\u000a      Officer recognises this, noting that: \"Through the original work and\u000a        the work under the Scottish Government contract, there has been a\u000a        greater awareness within SG of the importance of considering\u000a        geographical patterns in flood social (or socio-spatial) vulnerability\u000a        in addition to the geography of flood hazard-exposure\", also\u000a      confirming that the report for the Scottish Government was \"referred to\u000a        within the forthcoming Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme\"\u000a      [3].\u000a    The JRF `Climate Change and Social Justice' programme was the subject of\u000a      an independent evaluation which showed that [A] was one of the most\u000a      important pieces of work commissioned by JRF, and has `substantial\u000a      traction' amongst JRF's key audiences, with \"many examples of\u000a        instances where the messages from this project have been picked up\"\u000a      [4]. For instance, the Environment Agency (EA), which advises local\u000a      authorities and communities on flooding were \"impressed with the JRF's\u000a        well-grounded academic framework and robust research\" noting that: \"JRF\u000a        research on adaptation and social justice has been at the cutting edge.\u000a        We specifically changed some of our research plans in order to build on\u000a        JRF findings, rather than duplicate work they had already done\" [2].\u000a      Finally, JRF noted the importance of this work within their own ongoing\u000a      programme: \"we have prioritised it in our own communications activity\u000a        and JRF's programme manager has devoted substantial time and resources\u000a        to support its dissemination including seeking out opportunities to\u000a        present the findings and discuss the implications with key audiences in\u000a        many fora\" [4]. This is also evidenced through substantial\u000a      dissemination support, and the subsequent funding of ClimateJust (JRF\/EA).\u000a    (2) Local and Civil Society: At a local authority\u000a        level the research was disseminated though a series of meetings with\u000a      `Regional Climate Change Partnerships' for local authorities including:\u000a      Leicestershire, Leicester and Rutland (16th April 2012); South\u000a      East (23rd October 2012); Yorkshire and Humberside (27th\u000a      November 2012) [4]. The director of Climate East Midlands notes that: \"It\u000a        was particularly helpful for those audiences and for Climate East\u000a        Midlands partners to gain new insights into climate justice... via the\u000a        local case studies of specific neighbourhoods...This research work is\u000a        starting to have a positive effect on practitioners and policy makers in\u000a        the East Midlands, for instance by reference to its findings in the\u000a        Leicestershire Climate Ready Plan... This is the first type of area\u000a        based adaptation plan in the East Midlands and is promoted by Climate\u000a        East Midlands as an example of leading best practice. It contains an\u000a        action, with nominated lead responsibility to `map socio-spatial\u000a        vulnerability to climate change in Leicestershire\" [5]. These and\u000a      other events led to requests for information and further meetings with\u000a      additional local authorities including Calderdale, Cheshire West and\u000a      Chester, East Riding of Yorkshire, Knowsley, North East Lincolnshire,\u000a      North Lincolnshire, Powys, Rossendale and Wigan. The JRF evaluation\u000a      revealed that the report was \"being used widely by local authorities\u000a        in their own climate change work to draw out social justice arguments\u000a        and inform discussions with colleagues to create a shared agenda\"\u000a      [4]. For example, one local authority officer reports: \"We found the\u000a        mapping work... to be very useful and have applied it locally using our\u000a        own datasets in conjunction with adult services. We are currently adding\u000a        in datasets on public health to the map. I think it could make a\u000a        difference to how services are delivered in the future for example\u000a        through the relocation of adult day care centres\" [2]. Also,\u000a      Hampshire County Council \"has been using the mapping approach in its\u000a        own analysis of social vulnerability\" at an enhanced local scale\u000a      [4], and Wigan Council has stated that as a response to this work, they\u000a      are \"revising our climate change strategy and action plan and will\u000a        place a particular focus on climate change adaptation\" [6]. Finally,\u000a      the JRF report is \"being used as a basic evidence source for local\u000a        Health and Wellbeing Boards' Joint Strategic Needs Assessment promoted\u000a        in the guidance provided by DH officials... [and] used to scope\u000a        local action plans\" [4].\u000a    At the civil society level, meetings have taken place with\u000a      community groups (Westminster, 22nd September 2011) and housing\u000a      associations (Manchester, 10th October 2012). The research has\u000a      since been used by groups to formulate responses to adaptation. For\u000a      example, The Mersey Forest has used the data to help define an area for a\u000a      Big Lottery `Communities Living Sustainably Fund' application on community\u000a      led adaptation in practice. The research has also garnered wider media\u000a      coverage around the theme of justice in climate change adaptation,\u000a      including an article in The Guardian [7]. Overall, the JRF report has\u000a      reached a wide audience and garnered \"... international interest...\u000a        linked to a presentation by JRF at the Future Cities adaptation\u000a        conference held in Hastings on 26\/7 February 2013 which was attended by\u000a        a range of European cities involved in a European project on adaptation\u000a        where social justice issues were new to some of the audience and some\u000a        participants particularly remarked on the interesting approach taken on\u000a        the vulnerability work\" [4].\u000a    A range of secondary impacts have also emerged from the\u000a      research at UoM. The SDC project `Redefining Prosperity' considered\u000a      whether improvements in well-being can be decoupled from increased\u000a      material consumption. Undertaken prior to Professor O'Neill's JRF work,\u000a      his `think piece', commissioned by the SDC, `Living Well Within Limits:\u000a      Well-Being, Time and Sustainability' (2008), considers both the promise\u000a      and limitations of hedonic theories of well-being in answering this\u000a      question, arguing that objective state theories offer a better starting\u000a      point for both addressing the question, and for understanding the nature\u000a      of inter-generational moral and prudential concern. The brief was utilised\u000a      in the final SDC report, written in 2009 [8]. The research has also been\u000a      presented to the public through philosophical societies in Manchester,\u000a      Lancaster and Kendal, and also at the Cambridge Festival of Ideas (28th\u000a      October 2011); a presentation is available online, with 1046 viewings [9].\u000a      In May 2009 Professor O'Neill's invited contribution on well-being\u000a      informed the Commission for Rural Communities (CRE) inquiry into the\u000a      `Future for England's Upland Communities', as acknowledged in a later\u000a      report [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Preference-satisfaction models of welfare dominate environmental policy\u000a      but are problematic both in respect to the value placed on environmental\u000a      goods and as a basis for environmental decision making.

Key collaborators in the Geography: Sarah Lindley\u000a      (Senior Lecturer, 1993-present); Joseph Kandeh (Post-doctoral fellow,\u000a      2010-2011). Professor O'Neill has also worked with the Department of\u000a      Politics and the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research.\u000a    This case builds on research initially undertaken by O'Neill as a\u000a      visiting Hallsworth Research Fellow (2001-2002), and continued since his\u000a      appointment as Hallsworth Professor (2005). It includes a series of\u000a        projects on climate justice, concerned with the conceptualisation,\u000a        measurement and mapping of climate change vulnerability in the UK\u000a        associated with flooding and heatwaves. The key project was\u000a      `Justice, Vulnerability and Climate Change: An Integrated Framework'\u000a      funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) (2011-2012; &#163;56,723) [A].\u000a      This was followed by grants to undertake additional work through the JRF\u000a      and Environment Agency (EA) project `ClimateJust' (2013-2014; &#163;89,845) and\u000a      the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), `Climate Change,\u000a      Justice and Vulnerability in Scotland' (2012-2013; &#163;1928). During this\u000a      period subsidiary work was also undertaken through the `Sustainable\u000a      Development Commission' (SDC) research programme on consumption and\u000a      sustainability. O'Neill also acted as an advisor on a Leipzig-based\u000a      project on capability-based approaches to sustainability (GeNECA &#8212; Just\u000a      Sustainable Development on the Basis of the Capability Approach,\u000a      2010-2012) [B].\u000a    The research focuses on developing an alternative to preference-satisfaction\u000a        conceptions of welfare, which avoids their weaknesses.\u000a      Preference-satisfaction conceptions, which take well-being to consist in\u000a      the satisfaction of preferences, have widely informed environmental\u000a      thinking and policy-making. In contrast, the research develops an\u000a      alternative objective state conception &#8212; according to which\u000a      well-being consists in the realisation of certain objective states such as\u000a      bodily health, interpersonal relationships, achievements and autonomy &#8212;\u000a      and considers its measurement and implementation in policy. Key themes\u000a      developed in the research include the following:\u000a\u0009  \u000a    \u000aWell-being, preferences and objective states: The\u000a      preference-satisfaction account fails to capture the impacts of\u000a      environmental `goods' and `bads' on human well-being. An Aristotelian\u000a      objective state account of well-being provides a better basis for\u000a      environmental policy making [C][F].\u000a    \u000aValuation over time: An objective state account offers a more\u000a      defensible alternative to preference-satisfaction accounts than recent\u000a      hedonic approaches to well-being. In particular it offers better accounts\u000a      of how well-being should be assessed over periods of time, as well as how\u000a      it might be sustained within environmental limits [E].\u000a    \u000aNeeds and capabilities: The differences between needs-based\u000a      and capabilities-based versions of an objective state account of\u000a      well-being are fewer than is often assumed, if needs are properly\u000a      conceptualised [B].\u000a    \u000aMulti-dimensional measures: Any defensible account of\u000a      well-being requires measures that are multi-dimensional and rich in their\u000a      content. Such an account of well-being can be found not only in recent\u000a      capabilities approaches, but also in the accounts of the standard of\u000a      living developed within the Vienna Circle [D].\u000a    \u000aDistribution: An objective state approach provides the most\u000a      defensible basis for conceptualisation and measurement of welfare for the\u000a      purpose of mapping distributive impacts of environmental changes [A][C].\u000a\u0009  \u000a    This philosophical perspective on well-being provides the conceptual and\u000a      normative underpinning for the first systematic mapping of vulnerability\u000a      to the welfare impacts of climate change in the UK [A]. The project\u000a      developed a novel approach to measuring and mapping climate disadvantage\u000a      and vulnerability. Climate disadvantage is understood to be a\u000a      function of the likelihood and degree of exposure to a climate hazard such\u000a      as flood and heatwave, and the vulnerability of individuals to such\u000a      hazards. Vulnerability is characterised by the degree to which an\u000a      event is likely to convert into losses in the well-being of those\u000a      affected. Understanding and measuring vulnerability to climate change\u000a      requires an account of the different dimensions of well-being that are\u000a      made insecure by floods and heatwaves, and requires a grasp of the factors\u000a      involved in converting these weather events into losses in well-being. Standard\u000a        economic and hedonic approaches to well-being fail to capture this full\u000a        range of losses, and standard physical climate models fail to capture\u000a        the full range of conversion factors.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28673","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Crome's and Hutchinson's bodies of work are united in their promotion of\u000a      philosophical literacy as\u000a      a method of facilitating professionals' own identification, rational\u000a      appraisal and practical adjustment\u000a      of the conceptual frames operative in the areas of pedagogy (Crome) and\u000a      public health\u000a      (Hutchinson).

He was also invited\u000a      to contribute to a panel\u000a      addressing a large gathering of teachers and educationalists at the 14th\u000a      International Writing\u000a      Development in Higher Education Conference at Liverpool Hope University in\u000a      July 2012. Currently\u000a      Crome is preparing a collaborative bid with philosophers at Nottingham\u000a      Trent University to the HEA\u000a      in 2014.The bid builds on his research concerning event-based pedagogic\u000a      practices. The aim is to\u000a      establish a web-based resource for teachers in Higher Education that will\u000a      constitute a reservoir of\u000a      reflections on classroom encounters. It will set out a series of\u000a      practices, activities and\u000a      engagements appropriate to each stage of an undergraduate Philosophy\u000a      programme.\u000a    Since 2011 Hutchinson has delivered public talks in Zurich, Moscow and\u000a      London problematising\u000a      the currently prevalent understanding of the relationship between science\u000a      and philosophy, and in\u000a      doing so has connected the declarations of the death of philosophy by\u000a      prominent science writers\u000a      such as Stephen Hawking, Peter Atkins and David Colquhoun with current\u000a      trends in public policy.\u000a      His recently-established blog, which explores these and related issues in\u000a      a manner accessible to\u000a      non-academics, is currently averaging 1000 views per calendar month (http:\/\/bit.ly\/16cYWt3).\u000a    Supported by MMU's new research strategy (see REF 3a), which makes the\u000a      involvement of non-academic\u000a      stakeholders and research `end-users' an integral element of all research\u000a      activity, Crome\u000a      and Hutchinson have opened up collaborative partnership links with\u000a      professionals in the spheres of\u000a      health-care, social work and Higher Education. Hutchinson organised a\u000a      series of three one-day\u000a      workshops on Evidence-Based Practice (http:\/\/bit.ly\/14pw57n)\u000a      in November 2012. These\u000a      workshops brought together philosophers with academics from a variety of\u000a      disciplines as well as\u000a      practitioners representing the professions of teaching, healthcare and\u000a      social work, professions in\u000a      which the Evidence-Based Practice movement has been influential in shaping\u000a      policy, as\u000a      demonstrated by Loughlin's work (see Case Study 1). These discussions with\u000a      healthcare\u000a      practitioners have led Hutchinson, in alignment with EPG's impact strategy\u000a      outlined in REF3a, to\u000a      initiate a new project exploring with NHS and other third-sector partners\u000a      how shame adversely\u000a      impacts on combating and treating HIV and STIs. This project now has three\u000a      non-academic\u000a      partners: the National Aids Trust [E], the Sexual Health Team at\u000a      the Genito-Urinary Medicine\u000a      (GUM) Clinic at Leighton Hospital, Mid Cheshire [F] and the Sexual\u000a      Health Team at the\u000a      Hathersage Centre (GUM Clinic) at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI). The\u000a      project is formally\u000a      endorsed and supported by Public Health England [G] and North West\u000a      NHS Sexual Health Group.\u000a      In close collaboration with his healthcare, government-agency and other\u000a      third-sector partners\u000a      Hutchinson has identified four ways in which shame negatively impacts on\u000a      attempts to combat and\u000a      treat HIV, which are: 1. Shame prevents individuals presenting for STI\u000a      testing. 2. Shame prevents\u000a      individuals from disclosing all the relevant facts about their sexual\u000a      history to the physician. 3.\u000a      Shame can prevent an individual from disclosing their HIV (or STI) status\u000a      to new sexual partners.\u000a      4. Shame can psychologically imprison people, making the task of living\u000a      with HIV a much worse\u000a      experience than it needs to be. The project sets out to allay and, if\u000a      possible, erase these factors\u000a      and thus make a significant contribution to better public health.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impacts of Hutchinson's and Crome's separate, yet closely interlinked\u000a      bodies of research\u000a      emerge from their shared commitment to the value of philosophical\u000a      literacy. They have both\u000a      argued that professional practice across the domains of Education and\u000a      Public Health is subject to\u000a      the effects of cognitive and conceptual frames, which Philosophy can help\u000a      to identify, appraise and\u000a      improve.

The research generating\u000a      Crome's impact dates\u000a      back to two MMU-funded studies (`Text-Based Teaching and Learning in\u000a      Philosophy', 2002;\u000a      `Improving Student Progression and Retention', 2003) and three HEA-funded\u000a      studies (totalling\u000a      &#163;11,000; see Section 3) examining principles of `autonomous learning'.\u000a      Crome's research seeks to\u000a      identify the conceptual frameworks and background assumptions that inform\u000a      prescriptive\u000a      guidelines on how successful teaching should be undertaken, and shape both\u000a      public and\u000a      professional discourse on pedagogical policy. Taking the widely deplored\u000a      deficit of reading skills in\u000a      university entrants as his point of departure whilst proposing that a set\u000a      of such skills cannot be\u000a      inculcated in students as a fixed package, Crome's enquiry into\u000a      `text-based' philosophy teaching\u000a      identified the method of `autonomous learning' as a pedagogically more\u000a      effective way to impart the\u000a      subject-specific and generic skills required by students to succeed in the\u000a      study of Philosophy at\u000a      university level [1]. On the basis of this research, Crome was\u000a      then invited by the HEA Philosophy\u000a        and Religious Studies Learning and Teaching Support Network (HEA\u000a      PRS-LTSN:\u000a      http:\/\/bit.ly\/1a34o4X) to collaborate\u000a      on a project aimed at enhancing academic achievement among\u000a      Philosophy students, which led to a jointly authored article evaluating\u000a      the success of the project for\u000a      the benefit of Philosophy lecturers [2]. Building on this early\u000a      research, in 2009 Crome embarked on\u000a      a new project designed to further elaborate on the idea of `autonomous\u000a      learning'. Crome argued\u000a      that the current `learning aims and objectives' approach to pedagogy has\u000a      limitations and that these\u000a      derive from widely unacknowledged framing assumptions. By observing and\u000a      analysing actual\u000a      teaching practice in the classroom, Crome came to articulate an\u000a      alternative `event-focussed' way of\u000a      conceptualising effective pedagogy, which frames teaching and learning as\u000a      an ad hominem and\u000a      dialogic process, that is, as a genuine interpersonal encounter between\u000a      student and tutor [3].\u000a    Whereas Crome's work promotes philosophical literacy in pedagogical\u000a      practice through proposing\u000a      a reframing of current teaching and learning strategies, Hutchinson\u000a      pursues a cognate agenda by\u000a      applying his work on shame to an enquiry into the role and impact of\u000a      emotion on current modi\u000a        operandi in public health provision. Hutchinson joined MMU in 2004\u000a      and is currently Senior\u000a      Lecturer in Philosophy in the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at\u000a      MMU Cheshire. In his\u000a      monograph Shame and Philosophy [4], published in 2008,\u000a      Hutchinson argues that 1) shame is an\u000a      emotion of central importance to moral psychology but which has been\u000a      relatively neglected in\u000a      modern and contemporary philosophy, and that 2) understanding expressions\u000a      of shame requires\u000a      an understanding of the extent to which shame is a rational response to\u000a      the conceptually-mediated\u000a      life-world and operates at the level of conceptual frames (as opposed to\u000a      propositional attitudes).\u000a      Hutchinson's work proposes a new framework for understanding expressions\u000a      of shame. Themes\u000a      central to the argument in the book have undergone further elaboration in\u000a      two subsequent articles:\u000a    \"Facing Atrocity: Shame and Its Absence\" [5], which argues for a\u000a      revaluation of the importance of\u000a      shame in debates on moral perception and moral motivation, and\u000a      \"Emotion-Philosophy-Science\"\u000a      [6], which delivers a reinforcement of the monograph's argument for\u000a      understanding shame as a\u000a      rational reaction (rather than `causal' response) to the\u000a      conceptually-mediated life-world.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28883","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A broad range of beneficiaries, some from quite disparate domains, have\u000a      engaged with the body of\u000a      research described in section 2. In part this is a product of the\u000a      pro-active approach taken to\u000a      maximising the scope and depth of benefits generated by the unit's\u000a      research, described in REF3a,\u000a      section b; it also reflects the transformative nature of Currie's\u000a      research into narrative and character.\u000a    Consequently, mental health care and education are two key\u000a      domains to have benefited from the\u000a      research, and we also note that the research has stimulated public\u000a        debate to a significant degree.\u000a      The different beneficiaries (in all we report 6; 4.1-4.6) indicate the\u000a      far-reaching applications of the\u000a      body of research.\u000a    Context: Mental Health Benefits\u000a      Since 2008, Staff at Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital (AWCH) have\u000a      used Currie's work in\u000a      order to support an approach to the treatment of mental health issues\u000a      which mental health\u000a      practitioners believe to have beneficial outcomes for patients. The\u000a      research has also influenced a\u000a      training programme, the purpose of which is to educate mental health\u000a      practitioners in the use of this\u000a      treatment method. [5.1]\u000a    The approach taken to mental health issues emphasises building narratives\u000a      as the most ethically\u000a      responsible way to work with young people. To give some context: during\u000a      the period 2008-2012\u000a      AWCH had 24,045 Outpatients and 1,812 Inpatients. [5.1]\u000a    4.1 Benefits for Mental Health Care Patients\u000a      Research findings [3.1 &amp; 3.2] were embedded into care programmes at\u000a      AWCH, by Jureidini, where\u000a      he continues to work in the area of Psychological medicine. This research\u000a      suggests a different\u000a      approach to treatment and patient care; the patient is encouraged to talk\u000a      to their physician (or a\u000a      confidante) about their feelings in order to challenge the dominant\u000a      narrative. For example, a young\u000a      patient with externalizing disorders (i.e., attention-deficit\u000a      hyperactivity disorder, conduct problems)\u000a      might perceive their disruptive actions as products of their own\u000a      characters (a story with emotional\u000a      appeal and coherence), rather than seeing these actions as legitimate\u000a      responses to particular\u000a      circumstances (e.g., parental break-up). This treatment path trades upon\u000a      the notion that certain\u000a      psychotic states are \"disorders of narrative\". Where appropriate, this\u000a      \"narrative\" that patients `tell\u000a      themselves' can be challenged. Currie's research has been integral to\u000a      this: \"We rely on Currie's\u000a        work to support our emphasis on building more authentic narratives as\u000a        the most ethically\u000a        responsible way to work with young people\" [5.1]\u000a    This approach to patient care, developed using Currie's collaborative\u000a      research with Jureidini, is\u000a      taken to have very specific benefits. According to the former Head\u000a      of Psychological medicine at\u000a      AWCH, there is no evidence in favour of medication or specific forms of\u000a      psychotherapy as the best\u000a      means with which to engage some types of patient. However, `\"[t]hrough a\u000a      combination of `watchful\u000a      waiting' and physical and emotional rehabilitation, physicians may be\u000a        able to actively intervene\u000a        without reliance on medication or formulaic psychotherapy\". [5.1]\u000a      4.2 Training for Mental Health Care Professionals\u000a    Also since 2008, a training unit has been developed, and it serves to\u000a        help spread the\u000a        influence of Currie's research. The unit is the Paediatric Mental\u000a      Health Training Unit (PMHTU);\u000a      the training portfolio delivered there, and developed by Jureidini, uses\u000a      findings from his\u000a      collaborative research with Currie. As noted: `PMHTU is quickly building\u000a        a strong profile\u000a        meaning that narrative approaches developed with Currie are influencing\u000a        a wide range of\u000a        practitioners'. [5.1]\u000a    More than 300 members of staff (including medical students, general\u000a      practitioners, allied health\u000a      professionals, teachers and counselors) have been trained (for at least 6\u000a      hours, each) in the use of\u000a      a care model that seeks to explore young people's distress with the aim of\u000a      developing a narrative\u000a      that explains their predicament. [5.1]\u000a    Context: improving confidence and attainment for school children\u000a      Seeking to apply Currie's body of research in a different domain, in 2011\u000a      the unit used existing links\u000a      with local schools to translate the research into workshops on narrative\u000a      and character for primary\u000a      school pupils. The workshops helped develop children's understanding\u000a        of character and story\u000a        writing, improved their confidence, and instilled in them a desire to\u000a        read. Similar workshops\u000a      for secondary-age pupils had substantial effects upon student\u000a        attainment at the IGCSE.\u000a    4.3 Primary School Improvement\u000a      Insight into character and its role in narrative was seen as especially\u000a      valuable to children looking to\u000a      construct compelling and vivid narratives for themselves. Workshops on\u000a      narrative were designed.\u000a      Their aim was to teach children about Currie's research findings:\u000a      specifically, about the important\u000a      role that character plays in narrative, by character adding to the\u000a      coherence of the narrative and\u000a      enriching the connections between events. The sessions also taught\u000a      children that fictional\u000a      characters need not be like real people to do this, and that it often aids\u000a      the narrative if they are not.\u000a    Feedback from the sessions attests to their success in raising authorial\u000a      confidence. A teacher notes\u000a      that, `[the] project has not only developed my children's understanding\u000a        of character and\u000a        story writing but, most importantly, instilled in them a love of\u000a        literature and a desire to read'.\u000a      [5.3] Children themselves reported benefits: most of those surveyed were more\u000a        confident that\u000a        they understood why interesting characters are important to stories\u000a      than they were before, and\u000a      they felt that they had learned something that would help them to\u000a        write a better story. [5.4]\u000a    4.4 Influencing School Curricula\u000a      Teacher-training sessions delivered to teachers from 5 schools in December\u000a      2012 led to three of\u000a      the Primary schools feeling able to run the sessions&#8212;described as\u000a      `Thinking Space' sessions&#8212;in\u000a      school straight away. Teachers from two special schools who attended also\u000a      found the workshop\u000a      valuable for further encouraging thinking skills and open ended thought.\u000a      [5.2] The training sessions\u000a      were designed to show-case to teachers how to deliver the workshops\u000a      created by the unit,\u000a      explaining how they were built around philosophical research, and looking\u000a      to articulate the value of\u000a      that research to the teachers.\u000a    4.5 Secondary School Attainment\u000a      To help pupils prepare for their English IGCSE a more advanced version of\u000a      the workshop on\u000a      narrative was designed in collaboration with a local Secondary\u000a      School&#8212;Nottingham University\u000a      Samworth Academy (NUSA)&#8212;which had substantial effects upon student\u000a        attainment at the\u000a      IGCSE in June 2013. 26 of the students attending declared themselves more\u000a        confident in their\u000a      understanding of the role of character in narrative; 25 that responded\u000a      that they had learned\u000a        something that would help them with their GCSE. [5.4] Their teacher\u000a      said that `Results show\u000a      that pupils had made considerable achievement at this stage in their\u000a        learning. The\u000a        intervention ... played a significant role in this success.' By\u000a      using research to explain the\u000a      benefits of creating unrealistic characters, the University of Nottingham\u000a      staff enabled pupils to\u000a      produce imaginative coursework that showed a greater level of maturity in\u000a      their writing.' [5.5] NUSA\u000a      have taken the decision to run the workshops on an annual basis, to\u000a      support their students, such\u000a      was the success of the programme. [5.5] This reflects a substantive\u000a        change to their curriculum.\u000a    Context: The Influence on Public Debate\u000a      Issued by the University of Nottingham in 2011 [5.6], a press release used\u000a      Currie's research to\u000a      explain the appeal of the Harry Potter series and thereby stimulated\u000a        wider debate within the\u000a      press, and provoked considerable social media engagement with Currie's\u000a        research.\u000a      Specifically, it drew on two of Currie's claims: that character adds a\u000a      great deal to narrative, even in\u000a      the absence of real character in the world itself, and\u000a      that fictional characters need not be (indeed,\u000a      should not be) at all like real people in order to play the\u000a      role required of them in successful\u000a      narrative. The press release builds on this insight in order to argue that\u000a      it is Potter's character that\u000a      ultimately drives the success of the franchise.\u000a    4.6: Stimulating Public Debate\u000a      The Daily Telegraph subsequently (2011) published a report on\u000a      Currie's research. It was tweeted\u000a      47 times, linked to on Facebook 61 times and `shared' a further 108 times\u000a      [5.6]. Following on from\u000a      this, a second article in the Daily Telegraph (2012) discusses\u000a      Currie's view on the Potter series.\u000a      This second article was tweeted 65 times, linked to on Facebook 356 times\u000a      and `shared' a total of\u000a      421 times. The latter piece is also cited in an article in the Times\u000a        Higher Education during May\u000a      2012.

In particular, Currie and\u000a      Jureidini considered what we\u000a      might call pathologies of narrative; this includes the tendency to\u000a      exaggerate the effect of a person's\u000a      character, and particularly their intentions, on the explanation of\u000a      events.\u000a    Reviewing earlier work on Munchausen by proxy syndrome, Currie and\u000a      Jureidini [3.1] argue that the\u000a      narrative form itself has a tendency to encourage this exaggeration due to\u000a      its opportunities to \"tell\u000a      stories\" about why things happen which have emotional appeal, coherence\u000a      and intelligibility, rather\u000a      than scientific-explanatory virtues of evidential support, theoretical\u000a      parsimony, etc.\u000a    They also [3.2] suggest that narrative modes of thinking are writ large\u000a      in psychosis. Certain features\u000a      normally present in a standard fictional story, such as unrealistic\u000a      emphasis on the role of character\u000a      and intention (and the assumption that everything that happens in the\u000a      story is significant), are\u000a      grossly exaggerated in psychosis. They hypothesised that certain psychotic\u000a      states are therefore\u000a      \"disorders of narrative\".\u000a    Building on the discussion of narrative found in [3.1] and [3.2], Currie\u000a      [3.3 &amp; 3.4] then focuses on\u000a      the way in which the construction of a fictional story is enhanced and\u000a      enlivened through the use of\u000a      character. Currie argues that character may add to the coherence of\u000a      fictional narrative by enriching\u000a      the connections between events as it helps generate the emotional appeal,\u000a      coherence and\u000a      intelligibility of the fictional narrative. Thus, the same factors vivid\u000a      in the hypothesis that psychotic\u000a      states are \"disorders of narrative\" are, Currie claims, those that play an\u000a      active and important role in\u000a      a compelling fictional narrative.\u000a    Currie brings together and evaluates the literature and evidence from\u000a      empirical psychology,\u000a      drawing two findings from this work that trouble his hypothesis regarding\u000a      fictional narratives: we\u000a      tend to think that people's behaviour justifies attributions of character\u000a      when it does not; people\u000a      behave in ways that are strongly determined by circumstances. Both\u000a      findings suggest that real\u000a      character is far less significant than one might imagine to how people\u000a      behave in the world. That\u000a      threatens the suggestion that character adds to narrative: if there is no\u000a      such thing as real character,\u000a      then it is hard to see what value fictional character will have in\u000a      narrative.\u000a    Against this threat, Currie suggests we view character, less as a\u000a      psychological-explanatory tool,\u000a      and more as a device for making vivid and coherent the interplay of other,\u000a      psychologically real\u000a      factors. So, Currie suggests, character adds a great deal to narrative,\u000a      even in the absence of real\u000a      character in the world itself. Fictional characters need not be\u000a      (indeed, should not be) at all like real\u000a      people in order to play the role required of them in successful narrative.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28884","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In their consultancy roles, Mumford and Tallant have both\u000d\u000a      deployed their research to help refine and enhance software tools and\u000d\u000a      generate commercial value for commercial partners.\u000d\u000a    FACE, with whom Mumford engaged in his consultancy,\u000d\u000a      specialise in the development of assessment tools and software for health\u000d\u000a      and social care, and have a client base of more than 50 Primary Care\u000d\u000a      Trusts and a range of other hospitals and other health bodies. [5.1]\u000d\u000a\u0009  Mumford's involvement with FACE began in 2011and since then his research has\u000d\u000a      shaped the successful design of a database tool. Mumford drew on his\u000d\u000a      research, during the consultancy, and, working with FACE, was able\u000d\u000a      to help develop four important modifications to the tool, described below.\u000d\u000a      A product based upon the tool has now been developed. FACE recently turned\u000d\u000a      down a bid of $5m (US) for this product. [5.2]\u000d\u000a    FACE regard Mumford's input as significant, noting that Mumford\u000d\u000a      has played an, \"important role in helping us refine and develop the\u000d\u000a        tool.\" [5.2]\u000d\u000a    In his consulting role during the development of the database tool,\u000d\u000a      Mumford was in a position to bring the results of his research in ontology\u000d\u000a      directly to bear in modifying the product. His initial meetings with the\u000d\u000a      company helped develop the relationship, and have since been formalised\u000d\u000a      under a commercial arrangement. In their own words:\u000d\u000a    \"We are developing a new information system which challenges the\u000d\u000a      existing, long entrenched approach to database design...this system could\u000d\u000a      pave the way for a fresh new approach to information management in all\u000d\u000a      sectors of commerce and industry. Professor Mumford's advice to us was\u000d\u000a        very valuable.\" [5.2]\u000d\u000a    As noted above, there were four areas where Mumford's work had a\u000d\u000a      particular influence over the design of the database tool; these are\u000d\u000a      described in turn. As a result of Mumford's intervention:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aChanges were made to the design of the database so that it\u000d\u000a          could represent what is not the case. [5.2] Until Mumford's\u000d\u000a        involvement the database was able to depict only what is the case: the\u000d\u000a        `positive' truths. It could not capture the so-called negative truths.\u000d\u000a        It may be crucial in health care, for instance, that a patient is not\u000d\u000a        allergic to drug X or that they are not currently presenting\u000d\u000a        symptom S. Mumford challenged the designer to consider\u000d\u000a        whether and how they could represent such negative truths given, as Mumford\u000d\u000a        [3.3] (and also, Tallant [3.4]) showed, negative truths cannot\u000d\u000a        be straightforwardly derived from the positive ones.\u000d\u000a      \u000aChanges were made to the design of the database so that it\u000d\u000a          could represent what has been the case, but is no longer.\u000d\u000a        [5.2] Drawing on Mumford's research [3.2], to show that previous\u000d\u000a        tendencies (dispositions) can prove a significant factor in a medical\u000d\u000a        assessment, Mumford was able to point out the need for\u000d\u000a        refinements to handle specific cases. For instance, that someone is a\u000d\u000a        former-alcoholic may be crucial to a treatment plan.\u000d\u000a      \u000aChanges were made to the design of the database so that it\u000d\u000a          could represent not merely what something actually does, but also what\u000d\u000a          something may be disposed to do or have the capacity to do. [5.2]\u000d\u000a        A patient may not currently be unwell but it can be vital to know if\u000d\u000a        they have a vulnerability that, if put to the test, might be serious or\u000d\u000a        fatal, so the database needed to be able to record not just the actual\u000d\u000a        facts, but what could be the case, based on our knowledge of\u000d\u000a        dispositions and capacities. Mumford's expertise on the nature\u000d\u000a        of dispositions was crucial to this addition.\u000d\u000a      \u000aChanges were made so that the database was able to perform\u000d\u000a          more than merely additive functions on its data. [5.2] Having\u000d\u000a        recorded facts Fa, Ga and Ha, for instance, about particular a, the\u000d\u000a        database was able to form the conjunction Fa &amp; Ga &amp; Ha. Mumford\u000d\u000a        was able to improve the tool so that it could perform a range of other\u000d\u000a        functions. As shown [3.1], composition of causal factors often occurs\u000d\u000a        according to a nonlinear function, meaning that resultant causal powers\u000d\u000a        are not simply the mereological sum of component powers. To handle this,\u000d\u000a        the database had to be designed to be able to record facts relative to\u000d\u000a        an appropriate level of nature. For example, there can be facts about\u000d\u000a        persons that are more than just the sum of facts about their parts; the\u000d\u000a        database had to reflect this.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Tallant's involvement with Time.ly began in March 2012,\u000d\u000a      and since then his research has shaped the current design of the software\u000d\u000a      and supported a successful promotional campaign, after which the company\u000d\u000a      has recently been valued at $8.4m (CAN).\u000d\u000a    Themes from Tallant's research on presentism were disseminated\u000d\u000a      via the Department's YouTube channel in August 2011. This led to the video\u000d\u000a      being viewed more than 75,000 times, receiving 746 comments interacting\u000d\u000a      with the material and more than 1,000 `likes' (recommendations). [5.4]\u000d\u000a    The video was viewed by the technology company, Time.ly. A\u000d\u000a      Canadian software company, the key product that Time.ly produces\u000d\u000a      for users is event planning and calendar software, which is currently used\u000d\u000a      by more than 65,000 websites. [5.3] Clients include geographical based\u000d\u000a      communities such as Happening In Aspen or Logan Squarist\u000d\u000a      and also sector based communities like Brixton Buzz for music, or Geekwire\u000d\u000a      for technology. [5.3] Tallant joined Time.ly in an\u000d\u000a      advisory capacity in March 2012. Since then, they have taken part in\u000d\u000a      regular consultation meetings via Skype. [5.3]\u000d\u000a    Tallant's work has yielded a change to how the product will\u000d\u000a      represent time. In particular, Tallant has suggested that Time.ly\u000d\u000a      refine the product to bring out the significance of the present moment. He\u000d\u000a      has also explained how we can represent future events as in the\u000d\u000a        present as things that are going to be the case. This is to\u000d\u000a      treat them as akin to presently existing properties that point towards\u000d\u000a      the future (in the manner that the tensed facts described in section 2 point\u000a        towards other times). These ideas draw on Tallant's defence\u000d\u000a      and descriptions of tensed facts. [3.4 &amp; 3.6]\u000d\u000a    Tallant also noted that the product made by Time.ly is\u000d\u000a      currently presented in a standard calendar view; a static format that\u000d\u000a      fails to take into account the sense of importance that we normally\u000d\u000a      attribute to the present, and that also fails to represent the sense that\u000d\u000a      we have of moving through time, and the sense of time's passage\u000d\u000a      that we have&#8212;a theme developed in Tallant's research. [3.5]\u000d\u000a    Tallant's suggestions have fed directly into the design of\u000d\u000a        planned future iterations of the product and modifications will become\u000d\u000a        available to users. [5.3]\u000d\u000a    Tallant's work for Time.ly has demonstrably been commercially\u000d\u000a        valuable. Tallant has written a number of promotional items\u000d\u000a      for Time.ly [5.3], drawing upon his research on how people\u000d\u000a      naturally think about and experience time. [3.4 &amp; 3.5] This work with\u000d\u000a      Time.ly has \"helped the company to engage with a wider audience\".\u000a      [5.3] This is of financial value since, \"[a]udience is a crucial\u000d\u000a        factor for a company like Time.ly whose value depends upon the\u000d\u000a        number of users they can engage\".

The first is that it is perfectly coherent (desirable,\u000d\u000a      even) to treat at least some properties as being irreducibly directed\u000d\u000a        towards some particular state.\u000d\u000a    For instance, Mumford [3.2] has argued that it is central to our\u000d\u000a      best theory of properties that we treat them as dispositions for\u000d\u000a      some state. To illustrate, just as the property of being soluble can be\u000d\u000a      thought of as a disposition to dissolve in water, so we can think of all\u000d\u000a      properties as being tendencies to behave in some way once brought into the\u000d\u000a      right conditions. What is crucial, then, isn't merely that objects have\u000d\u000a      some particular properties, but the natures of these\u000d\u000a      properties&#8212;they are tendencies.\u000d\u000a    Mumford [3.1] (with co-author Anjum) expands this theory of\u000d\u000a      properties to develop a theory of causation that treats causation itself\u000d\u000a      as being a product of many different dispositions being brought together.\u000d\u000a      Thus, the cause of the fire isn't simply that the match was struck, but\u000d\u000a      needs to be understood as a far more complex arrangement, involving the\u000d\u000a      properties of the match, of oxygen and various other factors&#8212;all of which\u000d\u000a      are to be understood in dispositional terms. Mumford also argues\u000d\u000a      that we should see these dispositions as not necessarily being additive.\u000d\u000a      That is, it is not always true that a disposition to A and another\u000d\u000a      disposition to A leads to a disposition to A that is of twice the\u000d\u000a      intensity. For instance, one might think of ice as having a disposition to\u000d\u000a      reduce swelling if applied to an injury for a short duration. One would\u000d\u000a      naturally think that applying ice to a swelling for twice that duration\u000d\u000a      would double the anti-inflamatory effects. But, in fact, if ice is applied\u000d\u000a      to a swelling for too long it can actually lead to increased\u000d\u000a      swelling. To deal with cases like this, Mumford has developed a\u000d\u000a      model of dispositions where they are taken to not be additive.\u000d\u000a    In turn, Tallant [3.4 &amp; 3.6] has defended the view that there\u000d\u000a      are tensed facts or properties. This is the view that the world currently\u000d\u000a      instantiates (for instance) properties of the form having contained\u000d\u000a        dinosaurs, that are irreducibly past-directed properties. To speak\u000d\u000a      loosely, the properties defended by both Mumford and Tallant do not make a\u000d\u000a      difference to how their bearers are. Rather, they make a\u000d\u000a      difference to how they could be or have been.\u000d\u000a    Tallant has used this account of properties, alongside other parts\u000d\u000a      of his research [3. 5], to develop a defence of presentism. Tallant\u000d\u000a      defends the view that only present objects exist, but also [in particular\u000d\u000a      in 3.5] that there is constant change in which things these are. This\u000d\u000a      position is most naturally thought of as a dynamic theory of time that is\u000d\u000a      quite badly capture by static representations of time (such as those given\u000d\u000a      by a time-line).\u000d\u000a    The second common strand present in the works described concerns\u000d\u000a      `negative truths'&#8212;truths of the form `there are no xs'. Specifically, both\u000d\u000a      Mumford [3. 3] and Tallant [3. 4] have defended the view\u000d\u000a      that the negative truths do not have truthmakers. That is, truths like\u000d\u000a      `there are no unicorns' are not true because some object exists. Some\u000d\u000a      other explanation is to be given of why we think negative truths are\u000d\u000a      truths.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30412","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Ethical particularism is important in this case study because it is now\u000a      being discussed and debated within the legal profession, not just among\u000a      scholars but also practitioners. Specifically, tort lawyers have taken\u000a      cognizance of ethical particularism in the context of whether and to what\u000a      extent negligence determinations should be left to a jury, given the\u000a      variation of features across similar cases and the impossibility of\u000a      proposing hard and fast negligence rules.\u000a    In addition, particularism has become an important part of general\u000a      ethical debate among the public. This has partly arisen serendipitously,\u000a      via opportunities presented to Dancy, and capitalised on by him, to\u000a      publicise his research to a broad audience. He has on various occasions\u000a      presented his theory in an accessible way to non-academics, using concrete\u000a      examples of moral reasoning to illustrate abstract ideas in an engaging\u000a      and provocative way &#8212; especially the clash between our belief in\u000a      exceptionless general principles of morality, and our willingness to make\u000a      exceptions and qualifications in particular cases\u000a    Impact on the legal profession\u000a    Dancy's particularist theory has &#8212; in a way that is rare for the work of\u000a      a philosopher who is not a jurisprude &#8212; entered legal discourse as a\u000a      theory to be taken seriously in helping lawyers understand recent and past\u000a      rulings.\u000a    The most important evidence of the impact of particularism in the law\u000a      comes from the American Law Institute's (ALI's) Restatement of the Law of\u000a      Torts, 3rd edition, pub. 2010. ALI Restatements are internationally\u000a      recognised as highly significant legal documents. They are essentially\u000a      codifications of case law, i.e. common law judge-made doctrines that\u000a      develop gradually over time. Although Restatements are not binding\u000a      authority in and of themselves, they reflect the consensus of the American\u000a      legal community as to what the law is (and in some areas, what it should\u000a      become). There are then good grounds for viewing the Restatements as the\u000a      most influential secondary authority in this area. The above Restatement\u000a      (Ch.3 sec.8) says: `Tort law has thus accepted an ethics of particularism,\u000a      which tends to cast doubt on the viability of general rules capable of\u000a      producing determinate results and which requires that actual moral\u000a      judgments be based on the circumstances of each individual situation. Tort\u000a      law's affirmation of this requirement highlights the primary role\u000a      necessarily fulfilled by the jury.'\u000a    The citation for this passage names Dancy as the progenitor of\u000a      particularism and refers to a paper of his from 1983. It is extremely rare\u000a      for a contemporary philosopher to receive mention in an ALI Restatement\u000a      (indeed we are aware of no other examples). Although this citation refers\u000a      to a very early publication which predates Dancy's employment at Reading,\u000a      it is clear that it is the theory of particularism itself, developed over\u000a      several decades and reaching its mature and complete form in 2004, that\u000a      has led to the impact here, as opposed to a single early paper. This\u000a      assumption has been confirmed by email correspondence with the lawyer in\u000a      charge of the project. Furthermore, it is worth stressing that this impact\u000a      is on legal practice itself, not merely on academic discussion. The theory\u000a      of particularism is providing part of the intellectual toolkit by which\u000a      legal practitioners conceptualise and structure their domain, with ensuing\u000a      changes and benefits to practice and understanding amongst this community.\u000a    \u000a      The reach of particularism into judicial practice is also discussed in\u000a        a paper in the Hofstra Law Review, 2008. Here an academic lawyer argues\u000a        that a preference for particularism explains the way in which judges\u000a        decide certain cases and he makes explicit reference numerous times to\u000a        Dancy. Again, the point to stress here is that it is the judges and\u000a        lawyers on whom particularism is held to have had an influence, even if\u000a        it may be through the medium of academic legal interpretation: the\u000a        decisions judges reach are being shaped by, and can best be understood\u000a        by practitioners in terms of, ethical particularism.\u000a      Finally, a recent US Supreme Court decision, Hosanna-Tabor (2012) has\u000a        received much discussion amongst legal experts. One blog, Mirror of\u000a        Justice, discusses it at some length, with the author, a legal academic,\u000a        referring to the work of Dancy and `judicial particularism' as a way of\u000a        interpreting the decision. This leads to posts by a non-academic (as it\u000a        seems) debating the issue with the author\u000a        (http:\/\/mirrorofjustice.blogs.com\/mirrorofjustice\/2012\/01\/what-does-it-mean-to-call-a-judicial-opinion-particularist.html).\u000aIf\u000a        the interpretation by the original post's author is correct, then it can\u000a        also be claimed with plausibility that particularism has influenced the\u000a        Supreme Court justices themselves, even if they have not heard of Dancy\u000a        by name.\u000a      Given the influence and importance of ALI Restatements and the\u000a        recentness of this evidence of impact, we think it reasonable to suggest\u000a        that the impact seen thus far, though significant in its own right, also\u000a        constitutes only the initial stages of potential impact. The Department\u000a        is committed to working closely with Dancy to consolidate the impact of\u000a        his research in this crucial area, ensuring maximum reach for his\u000a        important philosophical work.\u000a    \u000a    General impact outside academia\u000a    Dancy's research has also found its way into the arena of general public\u000a      debate about morality:\u000a    \u000a      Dancy, extremely unusually for a professional philosopher, was invited\u000a        to appear on a popular TV show in 2010. His interview on the US\u000a        late-night talk show The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson (audience\u000a        1.4 million) was devoted almost entirely to explaining moral\u000a        particularism to a general audience, which Dancy did admirably well. Not\u000a        only was the interviewer enthralled, but follow-up comments on the\u000a        Internet show non-academics engaging with the topic. Ferguson himself\u000a        joked that the research was just the thing to appeal to the 18-35 `kids'\u000a        in his audience demographic.\u000a      The cultural reach of moral particularism is also evidenced by a\u000a        lengthy discussion, with Dancy prominently named, in a 2013 article for\u000a        the digital magazine Aeon (which `seeks to invigorate conversations\u000a        about worldviews...open to diverse perspectives and committed to\u000a        progressive social change'). The discussion has thus far generated 62\u000a        comments from interested lay readers (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/ompx87e),\u000a        together with 1000 `likes' on Facebook and 200 tweets.\u000a      Members of the public engaged with Colin Allen and Jonathan Dancy in\u000a        general ethical debate about whether there could be `moral machines' in\u000a        the blog On The Human (2011). Allen, an academic, tries to use Dancy's\u000a        particularism (cited by name) in the context of defending the\u000a        possibility of `moral machines' or `moral robots' capable of responding\u000a        to novel and variable moral situations rather than being programmed\u000a        (impossibly) to follow general principles. This leads to a response by\u000a        Dancy himself, debating with Allen over the extent of their\u000a        agreement\/disagreement, as well as a number of non-academics weighing in\u000a        with various opinions about particularism and the possibility of moral\u000a        machines.\u000a      A blog for discussion of theology and philosophy of religion (2010)\u000a        contains posts by non-academics discussing moral particularism, with\u000a        Dancy mentioned by name. His Stanford Encyclopaedia article on moral\u000a        particularism is cited, as well as the Wikipedia entry on him.\u000a      Finally, Dancy's Philosophy Bites podcast (a series aimed at\u000a        presenting philosophical research in a format accessible for\u000a        non-specialists), discussing moral particularism, has been downloaded\u000a        nearly 49,000 times. We can very safely be sure that the vast majority\u000a        of downloaders are non-academics for whom the podcasts are designed.\u000a        Again, we take this as evidence that his work has helped to inform and\u000a        shape views about morality among this group.\u000a    \u000a    Beneficiaries\u000a    Lawyers are now seeing particularism as a way of understanding judicial\u000a      determinations, especially in negligence cases (see for instance the\u000a      discussion of the decisions made by Justice Stevens at http:\/\/www.scotusblog.com\/2010\/04\/justice-stevens-particularist\/).\u000a      It has caused them to reflect on whether general principles can actually\u000a      determine a decision in factually similar cases.\u000a    Members of the public who have expressed opinions about the theory are\u000a      divided as to its strength. Some see it as a challenge to the very idea of\u000a      objectivity in ethics, others as a welcome alternative to a rigorously\u000a      rule-based application of morality to various situations. Some have\u000a      clearly been stimulated to apply particularist thinking to their own\u000a      specific concerns. All are provoked and challenged by the theory to think\u000a      more deeply about the content of an ethical system.\u000a    Reach and significance\u000a    It is hard to think of a much more significant impact on the American\u000a      legal profession than being mentioned in an ALI Restatement. Together with\u000a      the articles and online discussion cited above, we think this can ground a\u000a      claim for the highly significant reach of particularism in the profession.\u000a      Furthermore we know from a 2010 Wake Forest Law Review study that nearly\u000a      one third of US Supreme Court decisions cite academic articles published\u000a      in law reviews (http:\/\/www.abajournal.com\/magazine\/article\/the_high_bench_vs._the_ivory_tower\/),\u000a      suggesting that the impact of particularism is also being enhanced by its\u000a      discussion in academic legal journals. As far as wider cultural impact is\u000a      concerned, as with most philosophy it is hard to assess the number of\u000a      people influenced by a position or theory. The Craig Ferguson show\u000a      regularly attracts around 1.4 million viewers, of whom one can be certain\u000a      that thousands would at least have been challenged by the interview to\u000a      think more about ethical decision-making. Again, intensity of influence is\u000a      difficult to measure. Some viewers were sufficiently interested to read up\u000a      on particularism, especially Dancy's article in the Stanford\u000a      Encyclopaedia; one found the theory `very appealing' and wondered whether\u000a      further reading might `keep me from sleeping tonight'.\u000a    Evidence\u000a    In the case of Dancy's impact on legal reasoning in general and judicial\u000a      reasoning in particular, the evidence is that cited above. Furthermore,\u000a      there are a significant number of references to Dancy's work on ethical\u000a      particularism in various other legal journals, including his most recent\u000a      work such as the 2004 book, as well as secondary literature discussing his\u000a      theory. These include The Supreme Court Review (2004), The Stanford Law\u000a      Review (2002), The University of Chicago Law Review (2008), The Modern Law\u000a      Review (2005), and The Oxford Journal of Legal Studies (2009).\u000a    There are two points to make about this evidence. First, all of these\u000a      publications are contributed to and read by legal academics, who then\u000a      disseminate the ideas at conferences and workshops, where they often\u000a      become the common currency of debate within the legal profession itself.\u000a      We cannot prove that judicial particularist leanings in various decisions\u000a      such as Hosanna-Tabor were informed by ideas that originated in academic\u000a      journals. Judges do not usually cite academic works or opinions in their\u000a      decisions (but see above concerning the US Supreme Court). Nor, however,\u000a      do their interpretations of the law emanate from nothing more than their\u000a      personal and idiosyncratic predilections. Rather, their judicial work is\u000a      informed by, and taps into, the existing climate of debate over\u000a      interpretation, policy, the use of precedent, etc. This debate is to a\u000a      large extent shaped by the original work of academic specialists, some of\u000a      whom are practitioners themselves. Secondly, judges and legal\u000a      practitioners read academic journals and are directly informed by their\u000a      contents. We are therefore confident that Dancy's particularism has had an\u000a      impact, albeit indirect and via academic discussion in legal journals, on\u000a      non-academic thinking in the legal profession.\u000a    In the case of Dancy's work as it pertains to the wider community, there\u000a      can be no doubt that particularism has become a lively topic of discussion\u000a      among philosophically interested members of the public. The examples above\u000a      are typical. And here is a TV critic for Entertainment Weekly commenting\u000a      on Dancy's appearance on the Craig Ferguson show:\u000a    \"True to his desire, Ferguson hosted a segment with Dancy last night. May\u000a      I say that I not only found it a more entertaining segment than the one\u000a      that had preceded it &#8212; someone named Robin Williams was the first guest &#8212;\u000a      but that I want to take a class with Professor Dancy right now? Dancy is a\u000a      very big cheese in his field. [He] came very close to making a dunderhead\u000a      like me understand what he was getting at in making distinctions between\u000a      right and wrong and the context in which such terms have meaning.

Ethical\u000a      generalists, as they are often called, believe that to be a moral person\u000a      you must know and act on principles, which at their strongest are\u000a      exceptionless commands and prohibitions, such as `Love your neighbour' and\u000a      `Don't steal'. Without moral principles there can be no difference between\u000a      right and wrong, and no hope for an agent to be fully virtuous.\u000a    Over several decades of sustained research, Dancy has argued forcefully\u000a      against this traditional view of moral reasoning. He holds that there are\u000a      moral principles in the sense of rules of thumb, maxims, counsels, etc.,\u000a      but their function is not to guide action in an invariable way across\u000a      circumstances. Rather, a feature of a situation that makes an act, say,\u000a      wrong in one case may work differently in another situation to make that\u000a      act right. That A has taken B's property without permission does not\u000a      invariably contravene the supposed principle against theft, though it is a\u000a      feature of the case that usually counts against what A did, even if not\u000a      overwhelmingly. If B's property is a samurai sword and B is insane, it\u000a      would be right for A to take it off him without consent if he can. But if\u000a      B is sane and the sword is a mere ornament hanging harmlessly on B's wall,\u000a      taking it without permission would be theft.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34771","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2029969","Name":"Mongolia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research by Jonathan Wolff has had a significant influence on the design\u000a      and delivery of curricula\u000a      in the UK and beyond, particularly through the publication of the two\u000a      major research-based books\u000a      ([e] and [f]) described above. Both IPP and EPP were consciously developed\u000a      to serve as useful\u000a      pedagogical resources to engage students and self-directed learners,\u000a      including those with little\u000a      prior exposure to political philosophy, while at the same time drawing on\u000a      and presenting substantial\u000a      original research.\u000a    Although An Introduction to Political Philosophy [e] was first\u000a      published in 1996, it has continued to\u000a      have a lasting and substantial impact on the development and delivery of\u000a      philosophical education\u000a      throughout the period of assessment. Since 2008 the average yearly sales\u000a      figures for the English\u000a      language edition alone are 5,000 and have not fallen below 3,900 per year\u000a      [1]. The revised edition,\u000a      published in 2006, has sold over 25,000 copies since 2008: 43% in the UK,\u000a      24% in the US, 14% in\u000a      Europe, and 19% in the rest of the world. Sales regularly spike\u000a      significantly in September,\u000a      indicating that it is predominantly use for teaching [1]. IPP is also\u000a      widely disseminated through\u000a      photocopying, and has generated more than &#163;23,000 in photocopying\u000a      royalties since 2008; about\u000a      half from UK schools and further education colleges, a further third from\u000a      UK higher education and\u000a      the remainder from overseas [2].\u000a    Students of philosophy, political science and other fields have all\u000a      benefited from the research. The\u000a      reach of the books' impacts on education in these fields is\u000a      demonstrated by their use in a large\u000a      number of institutions across several countries (including China,\u000a      Bangladesh, Switzerland, the US\u000a      and Canada) [3], and by the diversity of their readers, who range from\u000a      school students and\u000a      undergraduates to postgraduates and adult learners. The significance\u000a      of their impact upon these\u000a      beneficiaries is suggested by the high number of modules and courses\u000a      modelled, in part or in\u000a      whole, on the books, and by the excellent feedback received from\u000a      instructors and students who\u000a      have used them. It is also demonstrated by the sheer fact that so many\u000a      courses have continued to\u000a      rely on IPP 17 years since its initial publication, and despite the\u000a      subsequent appearance of many\u000a      excellent competing texts. In spite of being less than two years in print\u000a      by July 2013, EPP has\u000a      similarly already become a core text for some courses on applied ethics.\u000a    Impacts on curricula for university students: Both books are key\u000a      texts for courses at a range of\u000a      institutions in the UK and overseas [3], where they have received\u000a      excellent feedback from both\u000a      students and teachers. In many cases, the courses that use them rely very\u000a      heavily indeed on the\u000a      books: at the University of Lancaster, for example, the first part of the\u000a      course Understanding\u000a      Politics and Governance follows IPP chapter by chapter [4]; the same is\u000a      true at Florida State\u000a      University, whose Introduction to Political Philosophy course (PHM 2300)\u000a      is likewise structured,\u000a      chapter by chapter, almost entirely around IPP. In Canada, the University\u000a      of Western Ontario used\u000a      IPP as the basis for a very large course, POL1020E, and set EPP for course\u000a      tutorials [5]. In 2012&#8212;3\u000a      around 500 students were enrolled on this course, which is required for\u000a      Political Science\u000a      programmes, and the course is currently being repeated in 2013&#8212;4 with a\u000a      similar enrolment [5].\u000a    The longevity of these courses suggests the significance of the\u000a      use of these books to them. At the\u000a      Open University, for example, extracts from IPP were used in the set book\u000a      (Arguments for\u000a        Freedom) used for course A211 which ran for ten years until 2011\u000a      with an average student\u000a      enrolment of 700, and for AA311, half of which was organised explicitly\u000a      around IPP [6].\u000a    Further evidence of the significance of the text to course leaders in the\u000a      field may be found in the\u000a      feedback they provide, both directly to Wolff, and to their students,\u000a      wherein they have also cited\u000a      the significance of these books to their teaching. At Dublin City\u000a      University, for example, where IPP\u000a      is essential reading for the course LG116, the course module guide ends\u000a      with the words: \"By far\u000a      the best and most accessible introduction to political philosophy. Read it\u000a      from start to finish, and\u000a      you may surprise yourself by enjoying it\" [7].\u000a    Further global impacts: As the book sales and royalties listed\u000a      above indicate, IPP reaches a\u000a      large audience overseas. Its English language version is used in overseas\u000a      territories such as\u000a      Japan, Bangladesh, Norway and Germany, as well as the USA, Canada, and\u000a      Australia. It has been\u000a      translated into Traditional Chinese (for Taiwan and Hong Kong) Simplified\u000a      Chinese (twice),\u000a      Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Lithuanian, Mongolian, and\u000a      Persian (an unauthorised\u000a      translation for the Iranian market) [1].\u000a    An example of its international use comes from China where IPP is a\u000a      widely used book on political\u000a      philosophy. For example, on DangDang.com, the largest book retailer in the\u000a      country, the Chinese\u000a      edition received 180 reviews between its publication in 2009 and July\u000a      2013, 99.4% of which\u000a      awarded the book at least 4 of a maximum 5 stars [8]. The newly\u000a      established Asian University for\u000a      Women in Chittagong, Bangladesh, likewise structured its introductory\u000a      course on Political\u000a      Philosophy (first taught in 2012) around IPP, which was also the assigned\u000a      primary text [3].\u000a    At a more anecdotal level Wolff has, over the years, received many\u000a      unsolicited emails about the\u000a      book from university and school students, members of the public and\u000a      teachers, commending it as a\u000a      compelling and accessible exploration of research. As a Jordanian\u000a      undergraduate at the Ludwig\u000a      Maximilian University of Munich explained: 'It's really one of the very\u000a      few books that actually get\u000a      the ideas across so easily, without having to over-complicate things.' (24\u000a      April 2012) [9]. This\u000a      accessible but comprehensive presentation of Wolff's research findings\u000a      allows the book's wide-ranging\u000a      readership to engage meaningfully &#8212; often for the first time &#8212; with key\u000a      tenets of Western\u000a      political philosophy.\u000a    Impacts on learning outside the university: The reach of the\u000a      educational impacts of IPP and\u000a      EPP extends even beyond its very significant contributions to curricula at\u000a      higher education\u000a      institutions (HEI) internationally. These wider impacts are delivered\u000a      particularly through its use as\u000a      the basis for less traditional higher education learning resources, which\u000a      allow a broader cross-\u000a      section of both UK and international communities to engage with political\u000a      philosophy at\u000a      undergraduate level. At a local level, for example, The University of the\u000a      Third Age (U3A) in Poole\u000a      organised a reading group for mature students using EPP in 2012; the group\u000a      was so successful\u000a      that it was recommended to other U3A groups [10]. Rather wider,\u000a      international benefits accrued\u000a      from Wolff being contracted in April 2006 to write an online module for\u000a      the Oxford University\u000a      Extension Course, which follows IPP chapter by chapter. The course ran 11\u000a      times between 2009\u000a      and 2013, and was taken by approximately 320 students internationally\u000a      [11].\u000a    The books have, moreover, introduced political philosophy to new, young\u000a      audiences, including\u000a      school students. Both IPP and EPP are designed to enable students to\u000a      engage with questions of\u000a      philosophy and consider their applications to issues or debates relevant\u000a      to their own daily\u000a      experience. This makes the two books particularly well suited for\u000a      non-traditional learners, and even\u000a      for GCE students. Alongside the reader Political Thought (also\u000a      co-edited by Wolff), IPP is the only\u000a      work of political philosophy listed in the Teacher Resource Bank for GCE\u000a      Philosophy published by\u000a      AQA, the UK's largest provider of academic qualifications for 14-19 year\u000a      olds. In 2013, 2,491\u000a      students took the Philosophy A level and 5,129 the AS level [12].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Jonathan Wolff at UCL has produced several important monographs\u000a      which are aimed at\u000a      both researchers and students, including An Introduction to Political\u000a        Philosophy (1996 and 2006)\u000a      and Ethics and Public Policy (2011).

The first of these is his exploration of contemporary problems in\u000a      political philosophy drawing\u000a      on the works of the great political philosophers of the past. This gives\u000a      rise not only to a better\u000a      understanding of philosophical problems, but also to insights into how\u000a      earlier political philosophers\u000a      can be read. The fruits of this research include, for example, a reading\u000a      of Hobbes that sharply\u000a      contrasts the `actual contract' elements of his argument with his\u000a      `hypothetical contract' and\u000a      explores their contrasting strengths and weaknesses [a]; an exploration of\u000a      the limits to voluntarist\u000a      theories of political obligation and the theory of fairness [b]; a\u000a      discovery of a previously unnoticed\u000a      paradox in democracy based on the distinction between voting on\u000a      self-interested grounds and\u000a      voting on ideas of the common good [c]; and a detailed discussion of a\u000a      difficult passage in Mill on\u000a      the regulation of indecency, which is used to motivate a `progressive\u000a      indirect utilitarian' reading of\u000a      Mill's liberty principle [d].\u000a    In 1996, Wolff published An Introduction to Political Philosophy\u000a      (hereafter IPP) [e], in which much\u000a      of this earlier research is combined with fresh research and presented for\u000a      a non-expert audience.\u000a      Rather than merely summarising the seminal texts and debates about the\u000a      interpretation and merits\u000a      of the ideas and arguments of political philosophers past and present, IPP\u000a      integrated Wolff's\u000a      ongoing research into those debates. Thus, clear accounts of the work of\u000a      the major political\u000a      philosophers and main questions in political philosophy are interrogated\u000a      through a series of linked\u000a      questions (beginning with `why should anyone be entitled to hold political\u000a      power?'), each of which\u000a      is addressed by drawing on Wolff's earlier work (including, but not being\u000a      limited to [a], [b], [c], [d]) to\u000a      answer questions about the nature, justification, and organisation of the\u000a      state and of citizens'\u000a      obligations, and to explore the concept of liberty and its limits. The\u000a      book also explores distributive\u000a      justice and the feminist critique of individualism.\u000a    The second strand of Wolff's research lies in applied ethics, and is\u000a      taken forward in his 2011\u000a      monograph Ethics and Public Policy (EPP) [f]. In this book the\u000a      research described above is\u000a      developed further via consideration of moral and political dilemmas of\u000a      public life, many of them\u000a      related to Wolff's work with public policy bodies or committees such as\u000a      the Gambling Review Body,\u000a      Rail Safety and Standards Board, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the\u000a      Academy of Medical\u000a      Sciences. EPP includes applications of philosophical ideas on topics such\u000a      as the regulation of\u000a      gambling, social provision for disability, the value of universal health\u000a      care, crime and the\u000a      justification of punishment, drug policy, public safety and the limits of\u000a      the free market, as well as a\u000a      methodological investigation of how moral and political philosophy can\u000a      shed light on public policy.\u000a      Much of the book is a reflection on the surprising and unwelcome discovery\u000a      that the straightforward\u000a      application of philosophical ideas to public policy will often yield\u000a      unacceptable social policies.\u000a      Nevertheless it aims to provide a model of the contribution that\u000a      philosophers can make to the\u000a      formation of ethically acceptable public policies.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34998","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Wolff's research on alternative approaches to injustice helped provide\u000d\u000a      the intellectual framework for pioneering work on self-directed support in\u000d\u000a      social care by a national charity, In Control. A collaboration between\u000d\u000a      Wolff and Simon Duffy, then Chief Executive of In Control, began in 2002\u000d\u000a      when Duffy, who had been experimenting with personal budgets for adults\u000d\u000a      with intellectual disabilities, attended a seminar at the University of\u000d\u000a      Sheffield, given by Wolff on the subject of disability. In subsequent\u000d\u000a      discussions, the two realised that Wolff's conceptual framework could\u000d\u000a      support Duffy's practical work, and this conjunction of Wolff and Duffy's\u000d\u000a      respective skills as a theoretician and a policy maker resulted in the\u000d\u000a      expansion of self-directed support and its adoption by the UK government.\u000d\u000a      Since 2008, the two major impacts of this have been:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Shaping government policy at both a national and local level.\u000d\u000a      Improving the health and quality of life of disabled citizens and\u000d\u000a        their carers by improving service delivery.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Self-directed support enables people eligible for social care to make\u000d\u000a      decisions regarding their care using a personal budget allocated to them.\u000d\u000a      This enables individuals to direct resources where they are most needed\u000d\u000a      and thus take control of their own care, and reduces the burden on social\u000d\u000a      workers and others working in social care. As a result, in 2012-13 alone,\u000d\u000a      over 600,000 people with intellectual and physical disabilities, including\u000d\u000a      many older people and people with mental health problems have been able to\u000d\u000a      direct their own care through personal budgets [10].\u000d\u000a    The idea of personal budgets had been treated with suspicion in some\u000d\u000a      political circles, in the belief that it was a revival of a `voucher'\u000d\u000a      system designed simply to save money, and would undermine collective\u000d\u000a      facilities such as day centres. Wolff's research provided a way to justify\u000d\u000a      personal budgets by emphasising the positive benefits of developing the\u000d\u000a      autonomy of disabled people who previously had little control over their\u000d\u000a      own lives, as well improving the efficiency of government spending. Those\u000d\u000a      receiving personal budgets could choose to spend money on collective\u000d\u000a      goods, as many did when the collective goods were of a decent standard.\u000d\u000a      Having the choice meant that individuals can design their own care package\u000d\u000a      which would typically also have other elements. Duffy renamed Wolff's\u000d\u000a      concept of `targeted resource enhancement' `Conditional Resource\u000d\u000a      Entitlement' (CRE) and used it as the basis for the development of an\u000d\u000a      innovative and workable concept of adult social care [see for example 2].\u000d\u000a      CRE provides a way to explain the nature of an individual budget as a\u000d\u000a      resource under the control of the person to whom it is delivered, but\u000d\u000a      subject to some conditionality or rules. According to Duffy, Wolff's\u000d\u000a      research paved the way for expansion of In Control's work by setting out a\u000d\u000a      conceptual framework that helped strengthen the intellectual foundations\u000d\u000a      of the work, clarified and framed the central questions it needed to\u000d\u000a      address and to explore novel ways of differentiating and conceiving policy\u000d\u000a      choices. This is acknowledged, for example, in the introduction to a 2010\u000d\u000a      article, where Duffy states: \"This article builds on initial analysis\u000d\u000a      first presented to the English Department of Health in 2007 via Waters and\u000d\u000a      Duffy's report for In Control on Individual budget integration. As\u000d\u000a      acknowledged in this initial report and in the current article, much of In\u000d\u000a      Control's initial thinking in this area has been influenced by the work of\u000d\u000a      Jonathan Wolff on disadvantage, inequality and different forms of redress\u000d\u000a      (see, for example, Wolff, 1998, 2002, 2003)\" [3, p. 506. Wolff 2003 is\u000d\u000a      [a], above]. Duffy's adoption of Wolff's approach enabled him to present\u000d\u000a      its advantages in seminars and meetings with local and national government\u000d\u000a      officials, such as to the Cabinet Office in 2004, in a concise and\u000d\u000a      rigorous fashion that made it appealing to local and national agencies\u000d\u000a      alike [9].\u000d\u000a    Wolff continued to be involved in In Control's later, larger experiments,\u000d\u000a      connecting disability service provision with the `capability approach' in\u000d\u000a      political philosophy and stressing the importance of evaluating the\u000d\u000a      service to ensure that the burden of care was not simply transferred to\u000d\u000a      others in the community or family, such as mothers.\u000d\u000a    Self-directed support has since formed a key part of the personalisation\u000d\u000a      movement, which seeks to increase choice and control for adult users of\u000d\u000a      social services. This has influenced several national government policies.\u000d\u000a      In 2006, after successfully testing self-directed support model, the\u000d\u000a      Department of Health commissioned an In Control report on individual\u000d\u000a      budgets. That report, to which Wolff was a contributor, appeals to\u000d\u000a      conditional resource entitlement and draws `heavily from the recent work\u000d\u000a      of Jonathan Wolff on disadvantage, inequality and different forms of\u000d\u000a      redress' [1, p. 58]. It formed one of the bases of the development of the\u000d\u000a      Putting People First ministerial concordat, signed by 6 cabinet ministers\u000d\u000a      in December 2007, implemented from 2008, and adopted as a national\u000d\u000a      strategy from 2009 to 2011 [4]. Putting People First explicitly recognised\u000d\u000a      In Control as the pioneer of personal budgets. It has, in turn, catalysed\u000d\u000a      and informed over a hundred local government policies directly affecting\u000d\u000a      service provision, and influenced further government policy and programmes\u000d\u000a      such as Think Local Act Personal (January 2011), the cross-sectoral\u000d\u000a      partnership that succeeded Putting People First and which is based on\u000d\u000a      `self-directed support' [7]. In Control's influence among policy-makers\u000d\u000a      across the UK continues to grow and can also be seen in the newly\u000d\u000a      implemented Social Care (Self-Directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013.\u000d\u000a    By leading to improved social care service delivery, Wolff and Duffy's\u000d\u000a      collaboration has improved the health and quality of life both of citizens\u000d\u000a      who receive self-directed support, and of their carers. By March 2011 all\u000d\u000a      councils in England had implemented Putting People First [6], to the\u000d\u000a      benefit of at least 338,000 service users: in this context alone, the\u000d\u000a      research informed the deployment of more than &#163;1.5 billion of government\u000d\u000a      allocations in support of personal budgets [7, p. 3]. Specific examples of\u000d\u000a      local councils are Barnsley and West Berkshire, both of whom implemented\u000d\u000a      Putting People First from 2008 [6]. In 2012-13, \"the number of people\u000d\u000a      receiving self-directed support was 609,000 (an increase of 16% from\u000d\u000a      2011-12). Of these, 151,000 received a direct payment &#8212; up 8% from\u000d\u000a      2011-12. The number of carers receiving self-directed support was 100,000\u000d\u000a      (an increase of 28% from 2011-12)\" [10, p. 5]. Evaluations of the service\u000d\u000a      found those receiving personal budgets were significantly more likely to\u000d\u000a      feel in control of their daily lives, the support they accessed and how it\u000d\u000a      was delivered [8]. This confirms Wolff's hypothesis that `targeted\u000d\u000a      resource enhancement' can improve an individual's autonomy, independently\u000d\u000a      of any other effects on well-being. And as Wolff also argued, such\u000d\u000a      policies are likely to have further positive effects on the well-being\u000d\u000a      both of the individual who receives the budget and his or her carers. Even\u000d\u000a      when other factors were accounted for, personal budgets were also found to\u000d\u000a      be associated with statistically significant positive effects on carers'\u000d\u000a      quality of life and social care outcomes, without increasing public\u000d\u000a      expenditure [8]. Use of personal health budgets was further found to be\u000d\u000a      associated with a significant improvement in care-related quality of life\u000d\u000a      and psychological wellbeing [8].\u000d\u000a    The principal direct impact of Wolff's collaboration with In Control is,\u000d\u000a      of course, its effect on the more than 600,000 people who were in receipt\u000d\u000a      of self-directed support by 2012-13. However it is also important to note\u000d\u000a      that it has only been able to achieve this scale of influence through two\u000d\u000a      other types of impact. One is its impact on national government policy [4]\u000d\u000a      [5], which was essential for the programme to be implemented at scale. The\u000d\u000a      other is the way in which the programmes have been embedded in local\u000d\u000a      action [6] both prior and subsequent to its adoption as a national\u000d\u000a      programme. Putting People First was itself unique in establishing a\u000d\u000a      collaboration between central and local Government, the sector's\u000d\u000a      professional leadership, providers and the regulator; In Control's role in\u000d\u000a      pilot programmes &#8212; supported by Wolff's research &#8212; also represented a new\u000d\u000a      partnership between government and the third sector.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Jonathan Wolff provided the intellectual framework for\u000d\u000a      pioneering work on self-directed support in social care by In Control, a\u000d\u000a      national charity whose mission is `to create a fairer society where\u000d\u000a      everyone needing additional support has the right, responsibility and\u000d\u000a      freedom to control that support'.

Jonathan Wolff\u000d\u000a      (joined UCL as Lecturer in 1986; Professor of Philosophy since 2000)\u000d\u000a      became dissatisfied with this approach on the grounds that, first, it\u000d\u000a      assumes that all goods are commensurable and their lack can be remedied\u000d\u000a      with cash, and second, that it ignores the social structures that can\u000d\u000a      profoundly influence our well-being. Wolff began exploring alternative\u000d\u000a      approaches in the early 1990s and, in a project starting in 1997, Wolff\u000d\u000a      turned his attention to the question of how a society of equals should\u000d\u000a      treat issues of disability. He has since presented his findings on\u000d\u000a      disability in the UK, Europe, the USA and Africa.\u000d\u000a    In developing his own approach, Wolff suggested that the transfer of\u000d\u000a      resources is not always the best way to overcome disadvantage in cases of\u000d\u000a      disability. Transferring resources to a disabled person, in virtue of\u000d\u000a      their disability, appears to convey the message that they are to be\u000d\u000a      compensated for an inherent defect that makes them less able than others\u000d\u000a      in some relevant respect. This initially led Wolff to focus on a social\u000d\u000a      model of disability, in which the disadvantages faced by disabled people\u000d\u000a      are remedied by altering the social environment to allow them to function\u000d\u000a      more successfully within it. In 1999, Wolff wrote a paper integrating the\u000d\u000a      social model of disability into contemporary theories of equality.\u000d\u000a      Although this paper was widely circulated and later used in a 2002 USA\u000d\u000a      National Endowment for the Humanities summer school on disability, it was\u000d\u000a      never published in its original form because Wolff continued to develop\u000d\u000a      his thinking in more detail and came to question whether the social model\u000d\u000a      of disability was capable of covering all cases, especially those of\u000d\u000a      intellectual disability. Following discussions with disability activists\u000d\u000a      around 2001 and consideration of new experimental policies (especially\u000d\u000a      those of Simon Duffy, see section 4), Wolff concluded that in some cases\u000d\u000a      transferring money to disabled people is the most defensible\u000d\u000a      strategy after all. Even though changes to the physical, legal or cultural\u000d\u000a      environment will almost always be highly beneficial for people with\u000d\u000a      disabilities, such changes will not always be enough to remedy their\u000d\u000a      disadvantages. Consequently Wolff modified his view, allowing that tax and\u000d\u000a      transfer has a role alongside other approaches. That modified view &#8212; which\u000d\u000a      is of central importance to the impacts described here &#8212; was first\u000d\u000a      sketched out [a] and then more fully developed [b, c] in a series of\u000d\u000a      publications between 2002 and 2013, which first of all showed how the\u000d\u000a      social model of disability could be used to develop a new account of\u000d\u000a      `addressing disadvantage' more broadly in political philosophy, and then\u000d\u000a      went on to show that nevertheless it needed to be supplemented by other\u000d\u000a      forms of redress in the case of disability. Wolff drew on his experience\u000d\u000a      with In Control (as described in section 4), to present the joint work to\u000d\u000a      a philosophical audience [d], which was the first time he had explicitly\u000d\u000a      applied his framework to cognitive disability in detail. The work was\u000d\u000a      further developed in the context of a wide-ranging analysis of\u000d\u000a      disadvantage in a joint study with Avner de-Shalit (Hebrew University,\u000d\u000a      Jerusalem) in 2007 [e]. A further version was included as a chapter of\u000d\u000a      Wolff's solely authored book on ethics and public policy in 2011. [f]\u000d\u000a    At the centre of this research is Wolff's distinction between two\u000d\u000a      different rationales for providing money to people with disabilities:\u000d\u000a      `pure compensation', in which alternative goods are provided to make up\u000d\u000a      for the miseries or lack of `internal resources' of disabled people, and\u000d\u000a      what Wolff called `targeted resource enhancement' (later renamed\u000d\u000a      `Conditional Resource Entitlement' &#8212; see section 4), in which people are\u000d\u000a      provided with the means to buy goods and services so that they can achieve\u000d\u000a      a flourishing life in their own way. Wolff remains critical of pure\u000d\u000a      compensation policies, but argues that the disadvantages faced by a\u000d\u000a      disabled person can sometimes be best addressed by providing her with\u000d\u000a      money, not on the grounds that she is to be compensated for an inherent\u000d\u000a      defect, but rather that society should provide her with the means to\u000d\u000a      flourish in her own way. This has every chance of advancing not only the\u000d\u000a      individual's well-being, but also his or her autonomy, which, especially\u000d\u000a      for younger people with cognitive disabilities, has often been ignored or\u000d\u000a      overlooked.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35179","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    1.

The programme has also inspired them to find innovative ways\u000d\u000a      of bridging the gap between theory and practice as confirmed by a recent\u000d\u000a      GEMMA graduate statement\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/masteres.ugr.es\/gemma\/pages\/actividades\/cronicas-personales).\u000d\u000a    b. via British Council sponsored visits to universities in Chile, India\u000d\u000a      and Pakistan\u000d\u000a    Members of the Centre for Gender Studies successfully applied to the\u000d\u000a      British Council for a project of bilateral cooperation with the University\u000d\u000a      of Chile. This bi-lateral cooperation extended from 2002-2005. Its primary\u000d\u000a      aim was to reinforce and enrich the postgraduate curricula of the\u000d\u000a      University of Chile in the area of Gender Studies utilising as a model the\u000d\u000a      postgraduate modules developed in the University of Hull. The co-operation\u000d\u000a      involved extensive visits to Chile by Gonz&#225;lez Arnal who communicated in\u000d\u000a      lectures and seminars the distinctive features of the research in Gender\u000d\u000a      Studies undertaken in the University of Hull and explained in pedagogic\u000d\u000a      terms the structure of the postgraduate provision of Gender Studies in the\u000d\u000a      University of Hull. She also provided a wide range of research and\u000d\u000a      educational material (for example, books and papers authored by members of\u000d\u000a      the Centre of Gender Studies and module handbooks and handouts). These\u000d\u000a      lectures, seminars and the provided educational materials led to the\u000d\u000a      development of a curriculum for the Master Programme of Studies in Gender\u000d\u000a      and Culture at the University of Chile which is still running. Similar\u000d\u000a      bi-lateral co-operations funded by the British Council during the period\u000d\u000a      2000-2005 were established with the Haryana Agricultural University\u000d\u000a      (India) and the University of Peshawar (Pakistan) that led to similar\u000d\u000a      developments in postgraduate provision including at the latter institution\u000d\u000a      the founding of a Department of Gender Studies as part of the Institute of\u000d\u000a      Social Work, Sociology and Gender Studies.\u000d\u000a    2. Increase in knowledge and understanding of gendered body identity and\u000d\u000a      its relation to ethical and social issues of body modification. \u000d\u000a    This impact has been achieved in two ways. First, it has been achieved\u000d\u000a      locally in relation to the non-academic participants of a wide range of\u000d\u000a      activities organised by the Centre for Gender Studies and the Centre for\u000d\u000a      Research in Embodied Subjectivity. As explained in the impact template the\u000d\u000a      organisation of impact related interdisciplinary conferences, seminars,\u000d\u000a      and talks has been an essential feature of the approach to impact adopted\u000d\u000a      by Philosophy at Hull. During the assessed period, 6 main related\u000d\u000a      activities have been organised: a conference on Embodiment and\u000d\u000a      Subjectivity (May 2008), a conference on the Phenomenology of Illness (May\u000d\u000a      2010), and a series of seminars on Feminism Now (2011\/12), Reading the\u000d\u000a      Vulnerable Body (2010\/11), New Directions in Biology (2009\/10), Issues of\u000d\u000a      Transgender and Intersex (2008\/9). All these activities were open access\u000d\u000a      and attracted a diverse audience ranging from pressure groups concerned\u000d\u000a      with gender identity, including transgender groups to health care\u000d\u000a      professionals and artists. Each one of the two conferences attracted\u000d\u000a      approximately 50 non-academic participants while each of the seminars had\u000d\u000a      a regular number of approximately 20 non-academic participants.\u000d\u000a    Second, this impact has been achieved by the delivery of modules,\u000d\u000a      throughout the English speaking world, devised with reference to the\u000d\u000a      research undertaken at Hull. This concerns primarily the book Theorizing\u000a        Gender co-authored by Kathleen Lennon which provides a theoretical\u000d\u000a      overview of approaches to gender. It discusses the major theories\u000d\u000a      concerned with the ways in which we become engendered, and explains and\u000d\u000a      evaluates naturalist, psychoanalytic, materialist and post-structuralist\u000d\u000a      accounts. Theorizing Gender has been the basic textbook for\u000d\u000a      undergraduate and postgraduate modules on Gender Theory in both the UK and\u000d\u000a      the US. It is also the basic textbook for the core module `Feminist\u000d\u000a      Theory: Between Diversity and Difference' of the GEMMA programme.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Innovative research into gendered identities at the University of Hull,\u000d\u000a      under the auspices of the Centre for Gender Studies and the Centre for\u000d\u000a      Research into Embodied Subjectivity, led to the design and delivery of new\u000d\u000a      curricula in higher education internationally including the European\u000d\u000a      Union, the US and in Chile, India and Pakistan.

The key researchers for gender\u000d\u000a      theory include an interdisciplinary group of academics based in Philosophy\u000d\u000a      and the Social Sciences: Kathleen Lennon (Senior Lecturer, 1979 to 2007;\u000d\u000a      Professor, 2008 to 2014), Stella Gonz&#225;lez Arnal (Lecturer, 2002 to\u000d\u000a      present), Gill Jagger (Lecturer, 2007 to present), Rachel Alsop (Lecturer,\u000d\u000a      1996 to present), Suzanne Clisby (2000 to present), Annette Fitzsimons\u000d\u000a      (Lecturer, 2002 to 2012), and Mark Johnson (Lecturer 1996 to 2000, Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer 2000 to 2011, Reader 2011 to present).\u000d\u000a    At a time when feminist research into sex differences nationally and\u000d\u000a      internationally was concentrated within Women's Studies and foregrounded\u000d\u000a      the experiences of women, the Centre for Gender Studies at Hull viewed\u000d\u000a      gender as a relational phenomenon and paid attention to both masculinity\u000d\u000a      and femininity and, crucially for the theory that developed, put the\u000d\u000a      experiences of transgendered, transsexual and intersex people at the\u000d\u000a      centre of theory. Theories of gender were developed which thereby\u000d\u000a      scrutinised the phenomenology of gendered embodiment, and interrogated the\u000d\u000a      importance of biology; the role of psychoanalysis; difference and\u000d\u000a      diversity within masculine and feminine experiences; and the intersection\u000d\u000a      of gender and sexuality from these multiple perspectives. This led to an\u000d\u000a      exploration of the relation between naturalism, phenomenology and\u000d\u000a      post-structuralism (including crucially Queer Theory). The research was\u000d\u000a      informed by the speakers at a continuous series of seminars and workshops\u000d\u000a      in which gendered experiences and their impact on everyday life were the\u000d\u000a      focus of attention. Many speakers, who generously shared their personal\u000d\u000a      experiences or their empirical and theoretical work with us, also came\u000d\u000a      into the classroom to share these with our students, who recognised that\u000d\u000a      they were engaged in pioneering thinking. The establishment of the Journal\u000a        of Gender Studies (1991-present) was an important part of the\u000d\u000a      research and whose editors and editorial board include members of the\u000d\u000a      Centre for Gender Studies at the University of Hull (currently Alsop,\u000d\u000a      Clisby, Gonz&#225;lez Arnal and Jagger). A special issue on Transgendering\u000d\u000a      (November 1998) was guest edited by Stephen Whittle from Press for Change\u000d\u000a      and at that time introduced issues surrounding pregnant (transsexual) men\u000d\u000a      which has in the last two years been a focus of much media attention.\u000d\u000a    The research led to publications (see selection below) and informed the\u000d\u000a      development of the modules `Theorising Gender' and `Gender Science and\u000d\u000a      Knowledge' at the undergraduate level and `Feminist Theory: between\u000d\u000a      Difference and Diversity' at the masters level at Hull.

It has\u000d\u000a      brought about improvement in widening participation and it has helped the\u000d\u000a      development of policies and practices which will improve equal\u000d\u000a      opportunities in these HE institutions. It also had an impact on curricula\u000d\u000a      development in these countries.\u000d\u000a    More specifically, through MISEAL the research at Hull has fed into: (1)\u000d\u000a      the construction of intersectional indicators (which measure levels of\u000d\u000a      exclusion, discrimination and inequality) and principles of the process of\u000d\u000a      standardization of these indicators across HE institutions in Latin\u000d\u000a      America; (2) the design of a tool for the application of the standardized\u000d\u000a      intersectional indicators (which allows for comparative analysis); (3) the\u000d\u000a      guide and guidelines for workshops that aim at increasing awareness of\u000d\u000a      social inequality and exclusion in HE institutions in Latin America; and\u000d\u000a      (4) the strategy for analysis of the regulations and policies of HE\u000d\u000a      institutions in Latin America which aim at increasing widening\u000d\u000a      participation and equal opportunities. (The documents describing (1)-(4)\u000d\u000a      are already published on the MISEAL website.)\u000d\u000a    (1) and (2) have already been applied to the collection of statistical\u000d\u000a      data, regarding the student and staff populations in the participant Latin\u000d\u000a      American institutions &#8212; following an intersectional model- concerning age,\u000d\u000a      gender, sexual orientation, disability, socioeconomic background and race.\u000d\u000a      (Detailed information is provided in the MISEAL website.) Some of these\u000d\u000a      statistical data were never collected before (not even by international\u000d\u000a      bodies or NGOs). (3) has been informed by pilot workshops in 4 Latin\u000d\u000a      American HE institutions. The workshops provided training for students and\u000d\u000a      members of staff (both academic and administrative) in widening\u000d\u000a      participation and equal opportunities issues within an intersectional\u000d\u000a      approach. The participants used training materials written by the\u000d\u000a      consortium. The pilot workshops took place in Colombia, Uruguay, Costa\u000d\u000a      Rica and Nicaragua. (4) has been used for the collection and analysis of\u000d\u000a      relevant university regulations and policies.\u000d\u000a    Furthermore, the realisation of the importance of the collection of\u000d\u000a      relevant statistical data and of having a framework of protocols and\u000d\u000a      policies about widening participation and equal opportunities has led some\u000d\u000a      of the participant HE institutions to establish administrative and\u000d\u000a      research units to collect relevant statistical data and introduce relevant\u000d\u000a      regulations. For example: the Nicaraguan partner university has created a\u000d\u000a      university committee (Comite Institucional de Genero (CIG)) which has\u000d\u000a      overseen the creation of policies for gender equality in the university;\u000d\u000a      the Peruvian partner university has established an academic unit on gender\u000d\u000a      research (DIVERGEN) and a centre (VIDICP) which aims at making disability\u000d\u000a      visible; Ecuador in collaboration with the national degree accreditation\u000d\u000a      council CEAACES (Consejo de evaluacion, acreditacion y aseguramiento de la\u000d\u000a      calidad de la education superior) has established gender equality as an\u000d\u000a      area of research (including the provision of funding for PhD students).\u000d\u000a    MISEAL has also supported the collaboration between participant HE\u000d\u000a      institutions in Latin America and governmental and non-governmental bodies\u000d\u000a      in a number of projects to improve widening participation and equal\u000d\u000a      opportunities. For example, the participant HE institution in El Salvador,\u000d\u000a      under the auspices of MISEAL, has collaborated with the Department of\u000d\u000a      Social Inclusion of the Presidency of the Republic of Salvador to develop\u000d\u000a      a `Policy to promote inclusion and participation of disabled people in\u000d\u000a      HE'. They also developed a university diploma to promote inclusion of\u000d\u000a      disabled people in the university. The Peruvian partner university has\u000d\u000a      collaborated with the National Council for the Integration of Disabled\u000d\u000a      People (CONADIS) for the creation of an observatory which promotes and\u000d\u000a      monitors the integration of disabled people in society.\u000d\u000a    The HE institutions in Latin America under the auspices of MISEAL have\u000d\u000a      organized and participated in a large number of events (15 recorded events\u000d\u000a      in the first 7 months of the project-details available on the MISEAL\u000d\u000a      website) that have brought together students, members of staff,\u000d\u000a      representatives of governments and of groups of people who are vulnerable\u000d\u000a      or non-represented in universities. In these meetings the results\u000d\u000a      (statistical analyses and analyses of regulations) obtained by MISEAL have\u000d\u000a      been shared. For example: The Uruguayan partner HE institution organised\u000d\u000a      an event promoting the goals of MISEAL in which 1000 non-academic\u000d\u000a      potential beneficiaries participated. The Nicaraguan partner university\u000d\u000a      organized the event `Foro sobre ejes de desigualdad en la education\u000d\u000a      superior: propuestas de inclusion desde la unviersidad centroamericana'\u000d\u000a      the participants of which were students, staff (administrators, senior\u000d\u000a      staff) and representatives of NGOs and civil society from marginalized\u000d\u000a      groups (30 participants). The Universities from Colombia and Ecuador also\u000d\u000a      organized similar events and they invited representatives of\u000d\u000a      Afro-descendants collectives, LGBT groups and indigenous groups.\u000d\u000a    Finally, MISEAL has created a network of experts on intersectionality,\u000d\u000a      widening participation and equal opportunities. These experts have\u000d\u000a      participated in the production and exchange of knowledge in these areas.\u000d\u000a      Relevant outputs include a number of reports available on the MISEAL\u000d\u000a      website. Furthermore, the members of the consortium have participated in\u000d\u000a      two international conferences in Berlin (2010) and in Brazil (2012) (the\u000d\u000a      papers from which will be published) and many other international meetings\u000d\u000a      and conferences which involved external participants (see MISEAL webpage\u000d\u000a      for information about the events).\u000d\u000a    The beneficiaries of the project outside UK HE include:\u000d\u000a    (a) The EU and Latin American HE participant institutions.\u000d\u000a    (b) Students in the target groups &#8212; indigenous Latin American\u000d\u000a      populations, students of African origin, women, students with\u000d\u000a      disabilities, mature students, students from lower socioeconomic\u000d\u000a      backgrounds.\u000d\u000a    (c) Academic and administrative staff at the Latin American HE\u000d\u000a      institutions who benefit from enhanced awareness of widening participation\u000d\u000a      and are able to participate in the network established to share good\u000d\u000a      practice.

It was facilitated by the Centre for Gender Studies, founded\u000d\u000a      in 1996 and later also by the Centre into Research into Embodied\u000d\u000a      Subjectivity founded in 2007. The key researchers include Stella Gonz&#225;lez\u000d\u000a      Arnal (Lecturer, 2002 to present), Rachel Alsop (Lecturer, 1996 to\u000d\u000a      present) and Kathleen Lennon (Senior Lecturer, 1979 to 2007; Professor,\u000d\u000a      2008 to 2014).\u000d\u000a    The relevant research had two main strands. The first combined empirical\u000d\u000a      research on implemented policies of widening participation in tertiary\u000d\u000a      education with philosophical analysis of their theoretical underpinnings\u000d\u000a      (primarily the model of rationality they presupposed). Gonz&#225;lez Arnal and\u000d\u000a      Aslop (see item 1 in references) explored ways of improving the\u000d\u000a      recruitment and retention of students from under-represented groups\u000d\u000a      (mature students, students with disabilities, part-time students and\u000d\u000a      students from ethnic minorities) in HE in the UK and proposed specific\u000d\u000a      policies that would improve the university experience of these students.\u000d\u000a      The research was further expanded to address issues created by the change\u000d\u000a      in policies on university funding in the UK that expected students to pay\u000d\u000a      fees. It was argued (see items 2 and 3 in references) that the model of\u000d\u000a      student which underpinned the new policy was that of a traditional\u000d\u000a      student, without caring responsibilities, who took decisions about\u000d\u000a      education by calculating its rates of economic return. Non-traditional\u000d\u000a      students, however, with caring responsibilities seemed to follow a\u000d\u000a      different model of decision making within tertiary education which focuses\u000d\u000a      on the needs of their dependants. The recognition of different models of\u000d\u000a      rationality at play here rested on research into the nature of rationality\u000d\u000a      undertaken by Gonz&#225;lez Arnal (item 4 in references) and the work of Lennon\u000d\u000a      et al. (see item 5 in references) on issues of difference and\u000d\u000a      diversity.\u000d\u000a    The second research strand focused on intersectionality which explores\u000d\u000a      the ways in which different categories (such as gender, class, race, age,\u000d\u000a      sexual orientation etc) combine to produce different types of inequalities\u000d\u000a      in different social contexts and different identities. This concept is\u000d\u000a      currently a major focus in feminist theory, particularly in transnational\u000d\u000a      contexts. Relevant research was already ongoing within the context of the\u000d\u000a      Centre of Gender Studies but it was further prompted by critical reflexion\u000d\u000a      on the methodology of MISEAL and its application in the context of Latin\u000d\u000a      America. The use of an intersectional methodology is a core characteristic\u000d\u000a      of MISEAL, but Latin American thinkers have argued that the use of\u000d\u000a      intersectional analysis furthers colonial oppression. They believe that\u000d\u000a      intersectionality imposes a colonial `logic of purity' on identity\u000d\u000a      categories which shapes the sense of self of those who have been\u000d\u000a      colonized. Gonz&#225;lez Arnal (item 6 in references) explored, via\u000d\u000a      philosophical analysis, some of the political and ethical consequences of\u000d\u000a      using intersectionality in the Latin-American context and argued that it\u000d\u000a      is possible to use it in a reflective manner that is non-oppressive and\u000d\u000a      that furthers equality.\u000d\u000a    Dissemination\u000d\u000a    The relevant research on widening participation and equal opportunities\u000d\u000a      in tertiary education was disseminated at a preliminary meeting of the\u000d\u000a      consortium which applied for the EU grant, when Gonz&#225;lez Arnal delivered\u000d\u000a      the paper `Politicas de inclusion de grupos minoritarios y su relacion con\u000d\u000a      el genero: las experiencias de los estudiantes' (the paper is published in\u000d\u000a      a volume with the title Incluyendo sin Excluir.

The relevant research on\u000d\u000a      intersectionality was disseminated at the first MISEAL international\u000d\u000a      congress, in the Freie Universit&#228;t Berlin, November 2012, where item 6 was\u000d\u000a      first presented.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35314","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Philosophers at St Andrews have engaged in a variety of activities which\u000d\u000a      have interested and\u000d\u000a      involved the wider community in discussions surrounding the history of\u000d\u000a      philosophy.

In January 2010 Craig\u000d\u000a      Smith appeared with Antony Giddens\u000d\u000a      and Naomi Klein on the BBC World Service programme Business Daily\u000d\u000a      to discuss the economic\u000d\u000a      and political ideas of Adam Smith (drawing on research including [5]).

Haldane writes frequently for The Scotsman, among\u000d\u000a      other print outlets, and has used\u000d\u000a      his column to show the relevance to modern questions of philosophers such\u000d\u000a      as Hume and Thomas\u000d\u000a      Reid, and of the Scottish Enlightenment more generally (drawing on the\u000d\u000a      research of Harris and\u000d\u000a      Smith, e.g. [3], [4] and [5]). Haldane's writing in The Scotsman\u000d\u000a      reliably generates comment. One\u000d\u000a      reader on his Hume piece, for example, wrote: \"Any more of this stuff\u000d\u000a        and people will start\u000d\u000a        regarding The Scotsman as a serious newspaper\". Harris has\u000d\u000a      written on Hume for The RSA\u000d\u000a        Journal, the main readership of which is the approx. 25 000 Fellows\u000d\u000a      of the RSA (motto: 21st\u000d\u000a      Century Enlightenment), but which is also available to all online.\u000d\u000a      He has written on Reid for The\u000d\u000a        Philosopher's Magazine, a magazine intended to bring philosophy to a\u000d\u000a      popular audience (including\u000d\u000a      school students), drawing on his [3] and [4]. The Philosopher's\u000d\u000a        Magazine has a vibrant online\u000d\u000a      presence, and Haldane has written a blog post there on the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Enlightenment, described in\u000d\u000a      the comment thread as \"heart-warming\" [S5]. Mention should also be\u000d\u000a      made here of Craig Smith's\u000d\u000a      book (written with Tom Miers) Democracy and the Fall of the West\u000d\u000a      (Imprint Academic, 2011). This\u000d\u000a      book, which draws in part on Smith's work on Adam Smith and the liberal\u000d\u000a      tradition, is intended for a\u000d\u000a      wide, non-specialist audience, and has provoked substantial comment on the\u000d\u000a      web [e.g., S6, S7].\u000d\u000a    Impact via personal interactions\u000d\u000a      We have given several lectures to large non-academic audiences. 2010 was\u000d\u000a      the tercentenary of\u000d\u000a      the birth of Reid and 2011 the tercentenary of the birth of Hume, and both\u000d\u000a      anniversaries were the\u000d\u000a      occasion of events that drew large public audiences. In April 2010 Haldane\u000d\u000a      spoke on Reid at the\u000d\u000a      Royal Society of Edinburgh. The lecture is available on YouTube and has\u000d\u000a      been viewed almost\u000d\u000a      2000 times [S8]. In May 2011 Harris spoke on Hume to an audience of\u000d\u000a      approximately 100 at the\u000d\u000a      Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities at Edinburgh. In July 2011\u000d\u000a      Harris organised a major\u000d\u000a      international conference on Hume in Edinburgh. The plenary sessions of the\u000d\u000a      conference were\u000d\u000a      open to the public, and a lecture by the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen drew\u000d\u000a      an audience of close to\u000d\u000a      1 000. The conference was reported on in the local media, and Harris\u000d\u000a      contributed to a Newsnight\u000d\u000a      Scotland segment on the conference. The segment is on YouTube and has been\u000d\u000a      viewed over 700\u000d\u000a      times [S9]. We have also been invited to speak on themes from the history\u000d\u000a      of philosophy in a\u000d\u000a      variety of non-academic settings: Smith has given talks to Loretto High\u000d\u000a      School (audience c. 40)\u000d\u000a      and the Dimensional Investment Fund (audience c. 100), whose `company\u000d\u000a      philosophy' is `markets\u000d\u000a        work'. Harris spoke on the Scottish Enlightenment to the 2010 annual\u000d\u000a      meeting of the Royal Society\u000d\u000a      of Anaesthetists (audience c. 300). Smith and Harris organized a session\u000d\u000a      on the Scottish tradition\u000d\u000a      of political thought at the 2012 Festival of Politics, part of that year's\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh Festival. All 80\u000d\u000a      tickets were reserved prior to the event. In all these instances,\u000d\u000a      researchers are drawing on their\u000d\u000a      own and their colleague's published research, including the items cited in\u000d\u000a      section 3, and earlier\u000d\u000a      publications.\u000d\u000a    Impact in the art world\u000d\u000a      We have brought our work in the history of philosophy into dialogue with\u000d\u000a      contemporary artists with\u000d\u000a      significant followings. In April 2010 Haldane organized a 'Festival of\u000d\u000a      Philosophy' at St Andrews that\u000d\u000a      featured philosophical and musical exchanges between Roger Scruton and the\u000d\u000a      composer James\u000d\u000a      Macmillan. This event was open to the public, as were Scruton's Gifford\u000d\u000a      Lectures at St Andrews of\u000d\u000a      the same year. These lectures were published as The Face of God in\u000d\u000a      2012, and the book has\u000d\u000a      been widely reviewed and commented upon [e.g., S10].\u000d\u000a    Haldane's intellectual influence has been acknowledged by Turner Prize\u000d\u000a      shortlisted artist David\u000d\u000a      Tremlett. Tremlett made a grid-text piece entitled `Faithful Reason p.\u000d\u000a      104, 2010', based on\u000d\u000a      Haldane's text Faithful Reason [S11] He also commissioned Haldane\u000d\u000a      to write a catalogue essay\u000d\u000a      for an exhibition `Walls' in Italy (2010) and to deliver a public lecture\u000d\u000a      in connection with a major\u000d\u000a      exhibition of his work at the Hamburg Kunstalle (2011).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Researchers in the history of philosophy at the University of St Andrews\u000d\u000a      have brought their findings\u000d\u000a      into public discourse both within Scotland and beyond.

In addition, he has\u000d\u000a      built on the work of earlier\u000d\u000a      generations of philosophers in developing a philosophical approach that\u000d\u000a      synthesises ideas and\u000d\u000a      arguments of Aquinas with the methods and achievements of analytical\u000d\u000a      philosophy, which he\u000d\u000a      termed `Analytical Thomism'. This has been taken up and is the subject of\u000d\u000a      print and online\u000d\u000a      encyclopaedia entries, internet discussions, as well as academic\u000d\u000a      publications, e.g. Analytical\u000d\u000a        Thomism: Traditions in Dialogue (Ashgate 2006). Haldane's principal\u000d\u000a      writings relevant to this\u000d\u000a      research are (with JJC. Smart) Atheism and Theism (2nd\u000d\u000a      Edition, Blackwell, 2003), Faithful Reason\u000d\u000a      (Routledge, 2004) [1], and Reasonable Faith (Routledge, 2010) [2],\u000d\u000a      in all of which the broad\u000d\u000a      Analytical Thomist approach is developed. Haldane has also pursued\u000d\u000a      research on Reid and his\u000d\u000a      contemporaries, producing four edited journal special issues including\u000d\u000a      co-edited issues of the\u000d\u000a      Philosophical Quarterly (2002) and of the Monist (2006).\u000d\u000a    Hume and the Scottish Enlightenment more generally are the principal\u000d\u000a      subjects of recent research\u000d\u000a      by James Harris, Reader, in post since 2004. In a series of\u000d\u000a      articles published in journals and\u000d\u000a      edited collections, Harris has explored the contexts for the philosophical\u000d\u000a      projects of eighteenth-century\u000d\u000a      Scots, examining in particular the role played by theological concepts in\u000d\u000a      the period's moral\u000d\u000a      philosophy [3], and the ways in which key figures of the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Enlightenment engaged with and\u000d\u000a      adapted ideas derived from the philosophical schools of Ancient Greece and\u000d\u000a      Rome (Stoicism and\u000d\u000a      Epicureanism in particular). He has been developing a comprehensive\u000d\u000a      interpretation of the\u000d\u000a      intellectual biography of David Hume, an interpretation that explores the\u000d\u000a      origins of Hume's\u000d\u000a      philosophical thought, and is able to make sense of the fact that Hume\u000d\u000a      made significant\u000d\u000a      contributions, not only to philosophy, but also to political theory,\u000d\u000a      political economy, and political\u000d\u000a      history [e.g., 4]. Harris has also prepared new editions of texts that,\u000d\u000a      while influential in the\u000d\u000a      eighteenth century, have since been neglected by historians of philosophy.\u000d\u000a    Craig Smith (Lecturer, 2007 &#8212; December 2012) specializes in\u000d\u000a      eighteenth-century Scottish thought,\u000d\u000a      in particular Adam Smith and Adam Ferguson. His main focus has been on the\u000d\u000a      methodology of the\u000d\u000a      `science of man' in the Scottish Enlightenment. In a series of articles he\u000d\u000a      has explored the\u000d\u000a      implications of the Scottish focus on unintended consequences for the\u000d\u000a      theoretical consideration of\u000d\u000a      social, political and economic phenomena. [5] Perhaps the most famous\u000d\u000a      iteration of this idea is\u000d\u000a      Adam Smith's `invisible hand'. Work on this concept led to articles on the\u000d\u000a      legacy of the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Enlightenment for contemporary social and political thought. Smith has\u000d\u000a      engaged in the continuing\u000d\u000a      controversy over Adam Smith's alleged relationship to contemporary\u000d\u000a      political thinkers of the left\u000d\u000a      and right. He is interested in conceptual history, the evolution of ideas\u000d\u000a      and the development and\u000d\u000a      coherence of traditions of thought. In addition to his academic work on\u000d\u000a      political philosophy, Smith\u000d\u000a      has contributed to policy papers that seek to apply the lessons of the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Enlightenment to\u000d\u000a      contemporary political issues.\u000d\u000a    Professor Roger Scruton, Professorial Fellow, in post since 2011,\u000d\u000a      has a longstanding interest in\u000d\u000a      Kantian ideas, particularly in relation to the beautiful and the sublime,\u000d\u000a      and drew upon this interest\u000d\u000a      in his Gifford Lectures at St Andrews, published as The Face of God\u000d\u000a      [6]\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35315","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research has translated into impact both via direct interactions\u000d\u000a      between researchers and user groups, and via more expository publications\u000d\u000a      based on the primary research, publications which are more accessible to\u000d\u000a      this audience of non-specialist teachers and their students.

These more accessible versions\u000d\u000a      of the primary research outputs have provided teachers with materials that\u000d\u000a      have improved their critical understanding of the two major moral\u000d\u000a      approaches at the core of the Ethics syllabi they deliver in their\u000d\u000a      schools, boosted their confidence in delivering these, and informed their\u000d\u000a      teaching at the level of lesson plans and content.

In total,\u000d\u000a      1100 SQCF philosophy credits have been earned by teachers via these\u000d\u000a      modules, and new teachers continue to sign up each year. The modules are\u000d\u000a      listed on the Education Scotland webpages, under their `CPD find' facility\u000d\u000a      [S3 and S6]. The reach of the modules has recently expanded further,\u000d\u000a      following a new collaboration with EIS, which will see the modules\u000d\u000a      promoted amongst 65,000 teacher members of this union [S1]. http:\/\/www.st-andrews.ac.uk\/philosophy\/pops\/onlinemodules\/\u000d\u000a    Impact on Teaching and Learning at Primary- and Nursery-School Level\u000d\u000a    Gaut's work on creativity and skill [&#167;3, (6)] has led to the development\u000d\u000a      of a method for carrying out philosophical enquiry sessions with very\u000d\u000a      young children, articulated in a textbook Philosophy for Young\u000d\u000a      Children (by Berys Gaut and Morag Gaut), which sold 880 copies\u000d\u000a      between publication in August 2011 and 31st July 2013. The\u000d\u000a      method was presented to a primary teachers' masterclass held in St Andrews\u000d\u000a      (April 2011) and primary teachers from 3 schools in Buckhaven (Fife) went\u000d\u000a      on to use this textbook to carry out philosophical enquiry sessions in\u000d\u000a      their classrooms as part of the `curriculum for excellence'. They have\u000d\u000a      benefitted from the introduction and use of this resource in terms of\u000d\u000a      increased confidence and improved ability to plan and maintain class\u000d\u000a      discussions of philosophical concepts and ideas. One of these teachers,\u000d\u000a      giving feedback on the success she had doing philosophical enquiries with\u000d\u000a      her primary pupils in the school [S2], noted that HMI inspectors carrying\u000d\u000a      out their inspection of her primary school had commented specifically on\u000d\u000a      the advanced thinking skills of her pupils, which she credits to the\u000d\u000a      philosophy sessions [corroborated by Colin Davidson of EIS, S1]. The\u000d\u000a      Gauts' method was presented again at the November one-day conference,\u000d\u000a      reaching an audience of 19 other primary teachers. 100% gave feedback to\u000d\u000a      the effect that they would alter their practice in some way as a result of\u000d\u000a      attending the sessions; one nursery teacher reported that Philosophy `will\u000a      now become part of the curriculum at St Andrews nursery', and also\u000d\u000a      that she intends to seek for philosophy to be promoted into the cluster\u000d\u000a      schools for the local high school. An educationalist from Moray House\u000d\u000a      School of Education, Edinburgh, reported that the conference would inform\u000d\u000a      his work on course design for primary student teachers [S5]. Following the\u000d\u000a      one-day conference, the Gaut textbook is now used by staff at Anstruther\u000d\u000a      Primary School Nursery (Fife), St Andrews Nursery Centre (Fife), Bright\u000d\u000a      Horizons Nursery (Fife), the Secret Garden Outdoor Nursery (Fife), and\u000d\u000a      Walton Lane Nursery School (Lancashire).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The published research of University of St Andrews philosophers has been\u000d\u000a      used to inform, support, and develop the work of teachers of philosophy in\u000d\u000a      primary and secondary education, principally within Scotland where the\u000d\u000a      teaching of philosophy has doubled in the last 10 years [S7].

They have published significant research in\u000d\u000a      these areas, and have also written texts making this research accessible\u000d\u000a      to a wider audience, by providing clear and accessible exposition of\u000d\u000a      philosophical theories, concepts, and methods that school teachers are\u000d\u000a      tasked with delivering in their classrooms; these illustrate how critical\u000d\u000a      analysis and evaluation of said theories and concepts is carried out. In\u000d\u000a      addition, Gaut's research in the area of creativity and pedagogy has led\u000d\u000a      to important pragmatic findings regarding the practise of philosophy with\u000d\u000a      very young children.\u000d\u000a    Harris (in post since 2004) has conducted extensive research into many\u000d\u000a      aspects of Hume's philosophy. His Of Liberty and Necessity [1]\u000d\u000a      provides the first comprehensive account of free will in British\u000d\u000a      eighteenth-century philosophy, addressing Hume in the context of his\u000d\u000a      predecessors and interlocutors; he has also written on the relationship\u000d\u000a      between reason and the passions in Hume [e.g. 2], on ideas of innateness\u000d\u000a      in this period, and on Hume and Reid on character. Mulgan (in post since\u000d\u000a      2005) is recognised as an authority on consequentialism, particularly\u000d\u000a      known for his work both on future generations [3], and on the\u000d\u000a      demandingness of consequentialist ethical theories. Timmermann (in post\u000d\u000a      since 2000) has written widely on the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant\u000d\u000a      [e.g. 4]. In particular, he has reshaped our thinking about Kant's Groundwork\u000a        of the Metaphysics of Morals, editing and contributing to the CUP Critical\u000a        Guide to the Groundwork, and publishing a new German text with\u000d\u000a      facing-page English translation, commentary and bilingual index [5].\u000d\u000a    Gaut (at St Andrews since 1990) has researched and published articles on\u000d\u000a      the topic of creativity.

This\u000d\u000a      applies to philosophy, amongst other domains, and the practical\u000d\u000a      development of the approach has resulted in a textbook (Berys Gaut and\u000d\u000a      Morag Gaut, Philosophy for Young Children: A Practical Guide,\u000d\u000a      Routledge, 2011) for teachers of nursery and primary school children,\u000d\u000a      which provides guidance and resources to introduce philosophical enquiry\u000d\u000a      sessions into classrooms (see &#167;4 for more detail).

Feedback on these courses includes \"Excellent\u000d\u000a        contribution that set agenda for a very lively discussion of a wide\u000d\u000a        range of topical issues with direct bearing on judicial work\"\u000d\u000a      (25\/2\/2010) and \"made me give thought to the time I take in my working\u000d\u000a        day to think of fundamental ethical or philosophical issues arising in\u000d\u000a        cases. I will now make time\" (2\/2\/11). [S2]\u000d\u000a    In developing this training, Jones and Haldane used various elements of\u000d\u000a      Haldane's research in practical philosophy. For example, `Crime,\u000d\u000a      Compensation and Social Solidarity' ([1], chapter 11), was relevant to the\u000d\u000a      following session held in 2012-13: \"`Ethics of Punishment' by Prof John\u000d\u000a        Haldane, University of St Andrews. This presentation looked at theories\u000d\u000a        of punishment and the philosophical angle of what punishment entails.\u000d\u000a        This was followed by some problem scenarios put to the participants,\u000d\u000a        looking at ethical dilemmas they could potentially face. Feedback for\u000d\u000a        the course was positive.

He has\u000d\u000a      developed a distinctive account of the role of philosophy in the wider\u000d\u000a      world, arguing against an idea of `applied philosophy' according to which\u000d\u000a      philosophy is first completed and then applied to practical issues,\u000d\u000a      preferring instead a `practical philosophy' which begins with questions\u000d\u000a      posed by human practice and develops philosophical responses to the issues\u000d\u000a      raised [1, especially the `Introduction' and chapter 1]. Haldane\u000d\u000a      articulates an account of the `public philosopher', set in contrast with\u000d\u000a      those presented by Rawls and by Habermas, with a particular focus on\u000d\u000a      questions about how religious commitments and concepts can enter into\u000d\u000a      public reasoning about the practical challenges which face us [2].\u000d\u000a    Haldane has a long-standing research interest in the role of values in\u000d\u000a      education, in the context of an account of education as a norm-bearing and\u000d\u000a      norm-constrained social practice. For example, he edited Values,\u000d\u000a        Education and the Human World (St Andrews Studies in Philosophy and\u000d\u000a      Public Affairs, Imprint Academic, 2004), a collection of the Victor Cook\u000d\u000a      lectures, contributing his own chapter `The Nature of Values' to section I\u000d\u000a      `Values and Values Education'; the volume was described as `highly\u000d\u000a      engaging...well-written and thought-provoking' (Journal of the\u000d\u000a        Philosophy of Education). Earlier work includes `Education:\u000d\u000a      Conserving Tradition' in Almond (ed.) An Introduction to Applied\u000d\u000a        Ethics (Blackwell 1995), and `The Very Idea of Spiritual Values'\u000d\u000a      [3]. Haldane's recent `Understanding Education' (chapter 13 of [1]) argues\u000d\u000a      for a conception of education as `conserving bodies of knowledge,\u000d\u000a      sentiment and conduct as these are incarnate in traditional practices.'\u000d\u000a      (p.333)\u000d\u000a    Roger Scruton (Professorial Fellow, in post since 2011) argues for\u000d\u000a      a conservative environmentalism in his Green Philosophy: How to think\u000d\u000a        seriously about the Planet [4]. Ideas of trusteeship, tradition,\u000d\u000a      home and land are set in a philosophical context reaching back to Hume,\u000d\u000a      Smith, Burke, Hegel, and Tocqueville; Scruton develops a notion of\u000d\u000a      `oikophilia', love of the household, which enables him to distinguish his\u000d\u000a      conservatism from more market-focused strains. For example, chapter 8,\u000d\u000a      `Beauty, Piety and Desecration', draws upon Scruton's earlier work in\u000d\u000a      aesthetics, particularly his books on architecture, to argue that `no\u000d\u000a      cogent environmental policy can be developed that does not, in the contest\u000d\u000a      between beauty and utility, put beauty first' [4, p.257].\u000d\u000a    Tim Mulgan (Professor, in post since 2005) has developed a\u000d\u000a      much-discussed theory of our obligations to future generations, based on a\u000d\u000a      distinctive rule-consequentialist account of the morality of individual\u000d\u000a      reproduction. In his Future People [5], he argues that the\u000d\u000a      resulting theory accounts for a wide range of independently plausible\u000d\u000a      intuitions concerning individual morality, intergenerational justice, and\u000d\u000a      international justice. In his `The Demanding Future' [6], he develops\u000d\u000a      these ideas further, by drawing on connections with his earlier book The\u000a        Demands of Consequentialism (Oxford University Press 2005).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35822","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research network, symposia, workshops, exhibitions and dialogues\u000a      allowed for the following specific impacts:\u000a    \u000a      increased awareness among educational and art practitioners of recent\u000a        feminist thought for educational and art practice; (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\u000a      increased awareness of pedagogical and artistic relations involving\u000a        gender, by creators, administrators, educationists and users; (1, 2, 3,\u000a        4, 5)\u000a      dissemination of a range of strategies for negotiating gender issues,\u000a        based on feminist philosophy, prison and community education, philosophy\u000a        for children, and art practices. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7)\u000a    \u000a    Evidence:\u000a    There were 26 respondents to a survey on the Engendering Dialogue events\u000a      (38% non-academics). 70 % agreed\/strongly agreed these events\u000a      increased\/developed their understanding of the significance of gender in\u000a      areas in which they work or practice. 85% of respondents agreed\/strongly\u000a      agreed these events made them aware of new practices, approaches or\u000a      theories relevant to areas of work or practice. (4)\u000a    These figures, allied to responses from several individuals, suggest this\u000a      understanding and awareness are leading to concrete changes in practice.\u000a      For example, respondents said that the events:\u000a    \u000a      led directly to collaboration between two young artists who as a\u000a        result will be taking part in a women's art collective in Leith, July\u000a        2013 (4);\u000a      had a direct impact on gender related activities among young women in\u000a        Dundee: one participant notes the event gave her the confidence to help\u000a        establish a University feminist society and to attend a Rape Crisis\u000a        Scottish conference on her own; this generated contacts leading to a\u000a        Rape Crisis workshop for the Dundee feminist society (4);\u000a      had a direct impact on teaching practice, this included one primary\u000a        school teacher and a teacher trainer (4).\u000a    \u000a    Many participants testified to the value of cross-generational\u000a      networking, contact, and collaboration between theorists and practitioners\u000a      (in the arts and across different pedagogical contexts). The point of this\u000a      research and its impact is to facilitate such change by allowing concepts,\u000a      problems and practical strategies from feminist philosophy to gain\u000a      traction outside academia (80% of survey respondents agreed\/strongly\u000a      agreed that the events were useful for stimulating\/ supporting activities\u000a      outside academia). It thereby contributed to the Scottish Government aim\u000a      of raising gender awareness; increased awareness of philosophical\u000a      resources around gender; and added to changes in social networks as well\u000a      as pedagogical and art practice. (4, 6)\u000a    This development from increases in awareness and understanding to\u000a      concrete changes was supported by events bringing artists and\u000a      educationists together with researchers at symposia and exhibitions. The\u000a      following groups were brought together in events where new art works,\u000a      discussion papers and connections were forged around concepts developed in\u000a      the research. In parallel to a public lecture and symposium on feminism\u000a      and the visual arts, an exhibition was organised at the University's\u000a      Centrespace gallery (Dundee Contemporary Arts). A workshop was held to\u000a      allow young artists to benefit from contact with more established\u000a      practitioners and feminist philosophers. Artists involved included Eleanor\u000a      Morgan, Beth Savage, Hannah Champion, Beth Fisher, Janet McKenzie, Ingrid\u000a      Pollard and Gina Wall. (7)\u000a    A panel discussion on art and feminist philosophy with artists (Fisher,\u000a      Pollard and Wall) was held in the exhibition space as part of the\u000a      symposium; this was open to the public. Young Scottish artists (Savage and\u000a      Champion) produced performance pieces specifically for the project in\u000a      direct response to questions posed about bodies and gender by the feminist\u000a      philosophy that framed the event. The workshop and discussions explored\u000a      how gender does (and does not) affect art practice. All the events were\u000a      attended by Dr Jones, artists and theorists, including members of a\u000a      Dundee-based performance art collective. (1, 2, 3, 5)\u000a    For the work on feminist philosophy and education, a symposium was held\u000a      with teachers and individuals involved in teacher training (in the UK,\u000a      Ireland and the USA), philosophy for children, teaching within the prison,\u000a      and community education. Key participants were: Kath Jones, leader of\u000a      Blooming Minds, on the transformational effects of teaching of philosophy\u000a      in primary schools, accompanied by a student teacher involved in the\u000a      Blooming Minds project; Amy Shuffleton, Department of Educational\u000a      Foundations, University of Wisconsin-Whitewater; Ann Louise Gilligan,\u000a      Director, Centre for Progressive Change, Dublin; and Merlyn Riggs, an\u000a      Aberdeen-based artist and facilitator working with food to generate\u000a      educational interventions, particularly in relation to work with\u000a      prostitutes and the police. A particular focus at the symposium was the\u000a      significance of gender in the context of work and education in prisons,\u000a      with Jim King, Head of Offender Learning &amp; Skills Services, Scottish\u000a      Prison Service, and filmmaker Jonathan Cummins, working with political\u000a      prisoners in Northern Ireland.

The main research work of international excellence\u000a      was a monograph, Irigaray: Towards a Sexuate Philosophy, on the\u000a      French feminist philosopher Luce Irigaray (2011). The monograph is in a\u000a      longstanding and influential series published by Polity Press, after\u000a      excellent reports from their international readers. The monograph has been\u000a      well-received in academic reviews, including International Journal of\u000a      Philosophical Studies 20 (5), 2012 and L'Esprit Cr&#233;ateur, Volume 52,\u000a      Number 3, Fall 2012. Alongside the monograph, Jones published an article\u000a      on Irigaray and Lyotard in Hypatia that explores many of the key\u000a      ideas linked to the impact: `Irigaray and Lyotard: Birth, Infancy, and\u000a      Metaphysics' (2011). Hypatia is one of the foremost international feminist\u000a      journals with a remit to broaden and refine feminist philosophy.\u000a    These two high level research outputs were prepared for by over a decade\u000a      of research on feminism and the work of Irigaray, beginning with the\u000a      chapter \"Aesthetics in the Gaps: Subverting the Sublime for a Female\u000a      Subject\" in Differential Aesthetics (2001). This was followed by\u000a      chapters on gender and philosophy in several edited collections; multiple\u000a      conference papers on feminist philosophy delivered in the UK, Europe,\u000a      Australia and North America; and invited papers on feminism and\u000a      embodiment, such as `Embodied Art: Thinking Through the Skin' for the Art,\u000a      Body, Embodiment: COGS interdisciplinary symposium (2005). Conferences\u000a      were organised by Jones around key ideas, such as the conference\u000a      `Natality, Embodiment and the Political: Feminist Conversations' in 2009.\u000a      This was further supported by editorial work for Women's Philosophy Review\u000a      and participation in the Women in Philosophy of Education Seminar hosted\u000a      by the University of Edinburgh (2010-12).\u000a    In the research, Jones argues that gender must be understood through the\u000a      concept of sexuate difference and that feminist thought, following\u000a      Irigaray, demonstrates the importance of sexuate difference in the social\u000a      and political place of women. The leading impact-oriented research\u000a      questions are then `What is the nature of sexuate difference?' and `How\u000a      should social and political structures take account of that difference?'\u000a      The insistence is on taking account of the differences between men and\u000a      women without seeing these as either simply biologically determined or\u000a      wholly culturally constructed, but as unfolding across lived experience in\u000a      ways that are inextricable from bodily, social and cultural\u000a      processes. This means challenging the dominant discourses of feminism\u000a      understood in terms of equality and asking how we can best attend to\u000a      difference in socio-political institutions and practices.\u000a    In order to bring these research ideas to practitioners in art and\u000a      education, Jones successfully applied for a grant designed to bring gender\u000a      and feminism into contemporary debates in art, science and education\u000a      (Royal Society of Edinburgh Funded Research Network in the Arts and\u000a      Humanities: Engendering Dialogue: feminist thought and contemporary\u000a      debates in art, science, and education.

When asked\u000a      \"what have you gained\u000a      from the Network?\" many answered that it had increased their understanding\u000a      of Spinoza and the\u000a      literature on him. Some noted they enjoyed the conference podcasts and one\u000a      said the Network had\u000a      given him\/her \"motivation to better myself\". (1)\u000a    Respondents were asked what direct and indirect impacts the Network had\u000a      on their work and\u000a      activities outside academia.

Two members who work in nursing and mental\u000a      health commented that\u000a      they use Spinoza's thinking to inform their practice.

(1, 5)\u000a    An artist (Tim Long) and a filmmaker posted work to the Facebook page for\u000a      members' comments;\u000a      three artists (who are not academics) were subsequently invited to publish\u000a      their work in Spinoza\u000a      Beyond Philosophy. Artist Patrick Fontana has used the Network to find\u000a      participants for a\u000a      collaborative multimedia artwork based on Spinoza's Ethics. The artwork\u000a      will be a sound and\u000a      image manual for the Ethics. It will bring the work to a wide audience in\u000a      a novel form which aims to\u000a      allow for an additional visual experience of the work. In these ways, the\u000a      Network has created a\u000a      space for new cultural works to emerge, provided an audience for existing\u000a      artworks, and\u000a      contributed to the public understanding of philosophy through creative and\u000a      imaginative works.(1, 5)\u000a      To achieve these impacts, the website (www.spinozaresearchnetwork.wordpress.com)\u000a      offers\u000a      podcasts of conference papers, event listings and resources.

A\u000a      Facebook group enables\u000a      members to speak to one another and share links and content. This has been\u000a      a success with non-academic\u000a      Network members.

It contributed to public discourse about\u000a      atheism, faith and science. The\u000a      broadcast generated a spike of visitors to the Network website, with 185\u000a      people visiting the site on\u000a      6 June 2011 alone (as opposed to 20-30 hits on a normal day), 31 were\u000a      directed to it from the ABC\u000a      website.

She published articles and delivered papers on this subject in\u000a      the UK, US, Europe, and\u000a      Australia. She collaborated with researchers at the University of Western\u000a      Sydney (UWS) on a\u000a      Spinoza and Narrative project supported by a UWS IRIS grant of AUS$11K.\u000a      Throughout this\u000a      research the guiding impact-oriented questions were `How are Spinoza's\u000a      ideas of living well based\u000a      on his Ethics?' and `How to make Spinoza's philosophy accessible\u000a      and culturally relevant?'\u000a    This research underpinned Lord's development, funding and organisation of\u000a      the Spinoza Research\u000a      Network through its arguments about Spinoza's relevance beyond philosophy,\u000a      in politics, law,\u000a      neuroscience, history and literature. Funding stemmed from the research\u000a      through an AHRC grant\u000a      (Networks and Workshops Scheme, &#163;25K, 2008 &#8212; 2010). Lord's research\u000a      explained why Spinoza's\u000a      philosophy should attract interest through its theory of human\u000a      relationships and as a guide to \"living\u000a      well\". This conception of living well extends to fields and interests\u000a      beyond philosophy by showing\u000a      the ethical and practical imperatives at work in them. In the same way as\u000a      Kant's philosophy has a\u000a      wide influence on current ideas about right and justice, Spinoza's work,\u000a      and its influence and\u000a      critical contrasts to Kant, offer a set of directions for connecting the\u000a      idea of a life lived well with\u000a      practices in fields such as politics, law and literature. The aim of the\u000a      network was to bring together\u000a      philosophical researchers with academics and non-academics, in order to\u000a      exchange and advance\u000a      new interdisciplinary research, and bring it to a wider academic and\u000a      non-academic audience. The\u000a      objectives were to draw Lord's research into the following: improving\u000a      understanding of Spinoza's\u000a      relevance in different disciplines; creating a network and resources to\u000a      support new research and\u000a      activities around his ideas; and building a stronger public culture of the\u000a      relevance of the history of\u000a      philosophy.\u000a    The guiding idea of the research network, following on from Lord's new\u000a      interpretation of the\u000a      meaning and place of Spinoza's work in relation to other subjects and to\u000a      the Kantian legacy, was\u000a      that Spinoza's significance is not restricted to academic philosophy. His\u000a      programme for living a life\u000a      well is relevant in numerous fields. Thus Network members come from over\u000a      15 different subject\u000a      areas, and 15% of members are non-academics. For instance, there are\u000a      artists, writers, and\u000a      filmmakers who use Spinoza's ideas to inform their practice. The creation\u000a      of the Network enabled\u000a      them to communicate their work to relevant audiences and collaborators.\u000a      These links between\u000a      philosophy and non-academic readers and users were revealed by the\u000a      project, which brought\u000a      researchers and practitioners together, making them aware of one another's\u000a      work.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36405","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    It is notoriously rare for academic philosophers to have their research\u000a      discussed outside academia.\u000a      There are quite a number of professional philosophers who make a career as\u000a      popularisers of the\u000a      views of others; many non-academics are familiar with such people. But for\u000a      a philosopher to have\u000a      their own original research discussed, repeatedly and at length, outside\u000a      academia, in the `public\u000a      square', is uncommon. Strawson's own research is rigorous and original.\u000a      His views are sometimes\u000a      radical, challenging our preconceptions about such topics as free will,\u000a      consciousness, personal\u000a      identity, and moral responsibility.\u000a    This has stimulated non-academics to question their assumptions and to\u000a      engage in debate with\u000a      each other about Strawson's theories. The impact is direct and continuing,\u000a      significant in its reach,\u000a      and clearly a prime example of how philosophy, done at its best, can\u000a      influence public opinion.\u000a      What is especially noteworthy is that so much of Strawson's impact derives\u000a      from his theoretical\u000a      rather than ethical research, though the former has ethical implications.\u000a      In philosophy, it is nearly\u000a      always ethicists who, for obvious reasons, have the most impact.\u000a      Strawson's case is unusual and\u000a      important in this regard.\u000a    Strawson's research, embodied in monographs and articles on the topics\u000a      listed above, has been\u000a      disseminated directly by Strawson and through third parties. Examples of\u000a      direct dissemination\u000a      through non-academic channels include Strawson's popular presentation of\u000a      his own original\u000a      research in his enormously popular New York Times opinion piece,\u000a      `Your Move: The Maze of Free\u000a      will' (2010) (http:\/\/opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com\/2010\/07\/22\/your-move-the-maze-of-free-will\/)\u000a      and\u000a      his appearances on radio and television, presenting and discussing his\u000a      ideas, such as his\u000a      participation in the 500th episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme of ideas,\u000a      In Our Time (2011,\u000a      weekly audience of 2 million) discussing free will with two other\u000a      philosophers. Comments on the\u000a      programme can be found at http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/radio4\/features\/in-our-time\/comments\/b00z5y9z\/,\u000a      with a commentary by the host, Melvyn Bragg, at http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/radio4\/features\/in-our-\u000a      time\/newsletter\/b00z5y9z\/.\u000a      Strawson has also appeared on television in the US (PBS, 2012, and\u000a      NPR, 2010) and Canada (CBC, 2010).\u000a    Strawson's research is also widely disseminated and discussed by\u000a      non-academics on Internet\u000a      blogs. For example, Strawson's article `Against Narrativity' was the\u000a      subject of a 2011 blog post,\u000a      with follow-up discussion: (http:\/\/whoistheabsurdman.blogspot.com\/2011\/01\/living-episodic-\u000a        life.html). In another instance, a non-academic posts a discussion\u000a      of, and is clearly persuaded by,\u000a      Strawson's research in philosophy of mind: http:\/\/integral-options.blogspot.com\/2010\/04\/toward-\u000a        science-of-consciousness-galen.html (2010). At http:\/\/guidetoreality.blogspot.com\/2006\/04\/thank-\u000a        you-galen-strawson.html, a non-academic blogger explicitly thanks\u000a      Strawson for persuading him of\u000a      the truth of panexperientialism, of which Strawson is the leading\u000a      exponent. (Originally posted 2006\u000a      but updated 2009.)\u000a    Strawson's work has also been promoted and stimulated debate through\u000a      online video clips. For\u000a      example, there are a number of YouTube videos in which non-academics, or\u000a      Strawson himself,\u000a      present and discuss his research. At http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kBUsrdk4f1s\u000a      a non-\u000a      academic discusses Strawson on free will (420+ views), and at\u000a      http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CtDgCQ5vehE\u000a      Strawson presents his views on the self (1,380+\u000a      views). In the YouTube video at http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kYUZWyAY9Lw\u000a      (2009),\u000a      someone who is not a professional academic (though evidently educated in\u000a      philosophy) presents\u000a      Strawson's research on moral responsibility to a lay public, generating\u000a      discussion.\u000a    (In all cases the content, context, or what the authors\/discussants say\u000a      about themselves in their\u000a      profiles, suggests that these are non-academics responding to Strawson's\u000a      work.)\u000a    While these instances give a general indication of interest in and\u000a      engagement with Strawson's\u000a      research beyond academia, two more-detailed examples will serve to\u000a      illustrate the nature and\u000a      extent of the debates that Strawson's work has fuelled in the public\u000a      arena:\u000a    Example 1: Strawson on the narrative conception of\u000a        personal identity.\u000a    Strawson argues against the popular view, defended increasingly within\u000a      professional philosophy by\u000a      narrative theories of identity, that people construct their identities\u000a      over time by means of a narrative\u000a      of their lives that continually builds on past experiences. The narrative\u000a      takes on a certain shape\u000a      peculiar to each individual. The normative claim often associated with\u000a      this descriptive claim is that\u000a      we ought to live our lives as if they were ongoing narratives.\u000a    Strawson subjects narrativity to sustained criticism in his 2004 Ratio\u000a      article, revised and reprinted\u000a      in his widely-discussed collection of essays, Real Materialism\u000a      (2008). This article is read and\u000a      discussed at length in the blog referred to above, where non-academic\u000a      bloggers outline Strawson's\u000a      case and express reasons for agreement with it. There follow comments by\u000a      readers of the blog,\u000a      some agreeing and others disagreeing. Some praise the more episodic\u000a      conception of personal\u000a      identity championed by Strawson and the freedom he thinks it entails.\u000a      Others warn of the dangers\u000a      of living life as if it were a series of episodes. Clearly these are\u000a      non-academics engaging directly\u000a      with Strawson's research, not merely agreeing or disagreeing but\u000a      explaining it to each other,\u000a      finding good and bad points in the argument, and subjecting Strawson to\u000a      some decent non-academic\u000a      evaluation. (Strawson himself has received a considerable number of\u000a      private\u000a      communications from people who do not fit the narrative mould, thanking\u000a      him for developing and\u000a      defending the non-narrative position.)\u000a    Example 2: Strawson on free will and moral\u000a        responsibility.\u000a    Strawson's original 1994 paper `The Impossibility of Moral\u000a      Responsibility' was revised, updated,\u000a      and published in Real Materialism (2008) as `The Impossibility of\u000a      Ultimate Moral Responsibility'.\u000a      This paper has generated an enormous amount of debate both within and\u000a      without academia. The\u000a      research was presented by Strawson in popular form in 2010, as a New\u000a        York Times opinion piece.\u000a      The public response was massive (for a piece by a philosopher) &#8212; over 600\u000a      comments, with people\u000a      agreeing, disagreeing, or just commenting on Strawson's belief that\u000a      ultimate moral responsibility is\u000a      impossible. This on its own is an extraordinary example of impact.\u000a    Commenters on the New York Times site defended or disputed\u000a      various premises in Strawson's\u000a      argument. Many focused on the key idea that we cannot be ultimately\u000a      responsible for the way we\u000a      are. Others wondered about a world in which free will was an illusion, or\u000a      something other than what\u000a      most people think it needs to be for there to be ultimate moral\u000a      responsibility.\u000a    Bloggers on other sites, such as http:\/\/www.thewarfareismental.net\/b\/2011\/04\/01\/on-galen-\u000a        strawsons-basic-argument\/, explain and discuss Strawson's views\u000a      (with over 100 comments on\u000a      this site alone). On http:\/\/blip.tv\/exploring-the-illusion-of-free-will\/28-galen-strawson-s-nothing-can-\u000a        be-causa-sui-refutation-of-free-will-5539216, George Ortega has\u000a      produced a series of videos on\u000a      free will, including an episode devoted to Strawson. (He also produces TV\u000a      shows and other videos\u000a      on sundry philosophical topics.) Clearly, Strawson's impact on\u000a      non-academics is significant and\u000a      ongoing.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Prof. Galen Strawson has developed ideas challenging our central\u000a      conceptions of the self,\u000a      freedom, agency, responsibility, and the nature of mental life. The impact\u000a      of his research at the\u000a      University of Reading has been a continuing one on cultural life and civil\u000a      society, helping to shape\u000a      the views of people outside the academy on these most important aspects of\u000a      our thought about\u000a      ourselves. Very unusually for an academic philosopher, Strawson has made\u000a      significant\u000a      contributions to popular debate on philosophy of mind, in particular free\u000a      will and consciousness,\u000a      and its implications for ethical thinking. This impact includes\u000a      contributions on national and\u000a      international radio, television, newspapers and blogs. Through these\u000a      means, Strawson's radical\u000a      thinking about subjectivity, the mind, personal identity, free will, and\u000a      moral responsibility has had a\u000a      direct impact on non-academic opinion and stimulated lively debate as a\u000a      result.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Reading\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Reading (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Reading","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007802}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    The research has been externally peer-reviewed and assessed to be of at\u000a      least 2* quality.\u000a    Books:\u000a    \u000a1.

In the background stand Socrates'\u000a      ethical questions: How should\u000a      we live? How should we live well?\u000a    Among Strawson's principal influences are Hume and William James. Other\u000a      important sources are\u000a      the ethical writings of Nietzsche and Montaigne. He also draws regularly\u000a      on current empirical work\u000a      in experimental and clinical psychology, on `life-writing' and literary\u000a      sources.\u000a    The research underpinning the impacts of Strawson's work on non-academic\u000a      opinion falls under\u000a      five main headings: consciousness; free will; the self; personal identity;\u000a      and the notion of narrative.\u000a      All these topics interconnect; all are of recurrent interest to the wider\u000a      community; passions can run\u000a      high. Strawson has published work on all these questions, and has\u000a      discussed them on radio\u000a      (BBC4, CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation), NPR (US National Public\u000a      Radio)) and on\u000a      television (US PBS), in newspapers, in public debates, in podcasts, and in\u000a      online videos.\u000a    Consciousness: The main drive of the work on consciousness is to\u000a      combat reductive approaches:\u000a      to show, for example, that there is no conflict between materialism,\u000a      properly understood, and full\u000a      acknowledgement of the reality and overwhelming importance of\u000a      consciousness. Of particular\u000a      relevance here is Strawson's vigorous defence of the reality of\u000a      subjectivity and the impossibility of\u000a      explaining it in narrowly physicalistic terms. Rather, he questions\u000a      whether we know enough about\u000a      the nature of matter to be confident that physics alone, at least as\u000a      currently understood, can\u000a      account for the emergence of consciousness.\u000a    Free will: There is intense debate in the public sphere about the\u000a      notion of free will and about\u000a      whether it is threatened by scientific advances, particularly advances in\u000a      brain science. Strawson's\u000a      main work here is to cast doubt on one popular but overly strong\u000a      conception of free will, and at the\u000a      same time to show that scientific advances pose no threat to any viable\u000a      notion of free will. Here,\u000a      the focus is on moral responsibility, where Strawson challenges the\u000a      commonly held belief that we\u000a      can be truly morally responsible for our actions, in the strong sense of\u000a      being the ultimate cause of\u000a      the mental states in virtue of which those actions are ours.\u000a    The self, personal identity, and narrativity: these three topics are\u000a      particularly closely connected.\u000a      There are two highly influential views worth mentioning. The first is that\u000a      normal people experience\u000a      or conceive of their lives and themselves in a `narrative' way, and in\u000a      some manner live in and\u000a      through this conception; the second is that people ought to live in this\u000a      way. Strawson has\u000a      questioned both these claims, arguing that they're not true for everyone,\u000a      and can even be\u000a      damaging for some.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38427","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In 2013 Archard was re-appointed after 7 years' service as one of twelve\u000a      members of the\u000a      Authority and as its sole philosopher. In 2013 the Government reversed its\u000a      decision to abolish the\u000a      Authority in acknowledgement of its importance in shaping policy and\u000a      practice at a national level.\u000a      The HFEA's example of regulation and licensing has been hugely influential\u000a      on other regulators of\u000a      fertility treatment and embryo research throughout the world.\u000a    Archard's role on the Authority is three-fold, and in all three aspects\u000a      his expertise as a\u000a      moral philosopher is critical.\u000a    First, he provides ethical oversight of all of its policy and regulatory\u000a      decisions. He thereby\u000a      influences professional standards and behaviour within the fertility\u000a      sector, and provides expert\u000a      guidance to Government. Ensuring that the Authority acts in an ethically\u000a      appropriate manner\u000a      retains public confidence in its key regulatory role and Government\u000a      contentment with delegation\u000a      of that role to an independent body. The Chief Executive of the HFEA\u000a      comments that `his voice is\u000a      listened to with great respect and he is one of the Authority's most\u000a      influential members'.\u000a      Archard has been prominent in discussion of every major HFEA issue over\u000a      the last seven years,\u000a      thereby influencing critical debates in public policy.\u000a    This has included the appropriateness of making payments to gamete\u000a      donors, where his `lone'\u000a      dissenting voice was reported in the national press\u000a      (http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/health\/healthnews\/8836470\/Egg-donors-to-receive-750-flat-fee.html\u000a        ),\u000a      and the debate on the licensing of the treatment of mitochondrial\u000a      conditions, a new and morally\u000a      controversial procedure. Archard made critical changes to the final\u000a      consultation document\u000a      submitted to the Government. As a result of the decision taken in March\u000a      2013 by the Authority the\u000a      door is now open to the United Kingdom being the first and perhaps only\u000a      government to allow\u000a      research into such treatment. (http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.co.uk\/2013\/03\/20\/three-parents_n_2917206.html)\u000a    Second, Archard has brought the insights of moral philosophy into direct\u000a      relation with all those\u000a      stake-holders affected by the general decision-making of the Authority,\u000a      thereby contributing to\u000a      widening public access to and participation in the political process. Thus\u000a      he has convened and\u000a      chaired workshops on the ethical aspects of key Authority policy, such as\u000a      that on the morality\u000a      of gamete donation (http:\/\/www.bica.net\/external-event\/ethical-issues-gamete-and-embryo-donation)\u000a      and contributed to workshops with clinics on PGD.\u000a    Third, Archard has performed a particular licensing role. In 2013 the\u000a      HEFA delegated the\u000a      authorisation of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, of the export and\u000a      import licences for\u000a      gametes, and of the use of any novel or controversial processes in\u000a      fertility treatment to a small\u000a      Statutory Approvals Committee, chaired and guided by Archard, meeting\u000a      monthly.\u000a    The Committee is legally authorised to license the testing of embryos to\u000a      detect genetic conditions\u000a      by means of Pre-Implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD). The statutory test\u000a      that must be met\u000a      before a licence can be approved is that the embryos being tested are at\u000a      `significant risk' of\u000a      inheriting `serious genetic conditions'. The Human Fertilisation and\u000a      Embryology Act (1990) does\u000a      not specify what is `significant' or `serious'. Understanding,\u000a      interpreting and applying this test is\u000a      down to the Committee Archard directs, which is in effect an expert panel\u000a      determining official\u000a      policy in this area on behalf of the Government.\u000a    Archard ensures that decisions are fair, proportionate, protect the best\u000a      interests of all children, are\u000a      morally and legally permitted, and are the best possible within the\u000a      context of non-ideal decision-making.\u000a      This work has been directly informed by his own research on the ethics of\u000a      procreation,\u000a      the best interests of children, and the appropriate role of ethical theory\u000a      in collective decision-making.\u000a      Well over a hundred such genetic conditions &#8212; including Alzheimer's, Beta\u000a      Thalassemia,\u000a      Huntington Chorea, Muscular Dystrophy, and Sickle Cell Anaemia &#8212; have now\u000a      been licensed and\u000a      around five new conditions are submitted for license approval monthly.\u000a    The impact of this work has been on thousands of prospective carrier or\u000a      affected parents who have\u000a      been able to avoid the transmission of serious genetic conditions to their\u000a      children, and on all those\u000a      children born without the conditions in question. It has also determined\u000a      the scope of the lawful work\u000a      that may be done by fertility clinics licensed in the United Kingdom to\u000a      perform PGD. It has impacted\u000a      upon the work of the Government thereby able to delegate decision-making\u000a      to the Authority, and\u000a      upon a general public that can retain its confidence in the proper\u000a      regulation of the uses of biomedical\u000a      developments. The Chief Executive of the HFEA reports, `that we have not\u000a      been challenged [in the\u000a      courts] to date is testimony to the quality of decision-making and the\u000a      skills of Professor Archard as\u000a      Chair.'\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) regulates a\u000a      central domain of current\u000a      biotechnological practice: fertility treatment and embryo research.\u000a      Appointed as the only philosopher\u000a      on an Authority of 12 members and as Deputy Chair of the HFEA's Ethics and\u000a      Law Advisory\u000a      Committee Archard has provided ethical advice on all new biotechnological\u000a      developments affecting\u000a      those tens of thousands of prospective parents seeking fertility\u000a      treatment.

The independent review of the Human Tissue Authority and\u000a      HFEA by Justin\u000a      McCracken in July 2013 recommended the continued independent existence of\u000a      the HFEA. Its\u000a      role is to protect patients and the public interest, to drive improvement\u000a      in the treatment and\u000a      research sectors, and to provide information to the public and\u000a      policymakers about treatment and\u000a      research.\u000a    Archard's original appointment to the HFEA in November 2005, and his\u000a      re-appointment in\u000a      December 2012 as the sole moral philosopher on the Authority was made in\u000a      recognition of\u000a      his internationally distinguished research in moral, legal and political\u000a      philosophy.\u000a    Archard's published research since his appointment at QUB on June 1st\u000a      2012 confirms his\u000a      reputation and distinctive role within the Authority. This research also\u000a      supplies key and original\u000a      insights of direct relevance to his work on the Authority. These concern\u000a      the significance of a best\u000a      interest principle as determinative of law and policy in respect of\u000a      children, and the nature of the\u000a      role of philosophers in collective decision-making in non-ideal\u000a      circumstances.\u000a    The principle of best interest is controversial, and is charged,\u000a      famously, with being ill-defined and\u000a      indeterminate. Archard's work has sought to explicate the principle and to\u000a      evaluate its proper\u000a      limits, especially in relation to other regulative principles, such as the\u000a      presumptive rights of parents\u000a      over their own children, the public good, and the right of a child to have\u000a      its views in respect of its\u000a      own interests given appropriate weight. The welfare of the child provision\u000a      is a key constraint in the\u000a      regulation of fertility treatment. It is also critically relevant to the\u000a      interpretation of PGD licensing,\u000a      where the relevant statutes demand that only where children are at\u000a      `significant risk' of `serious\u000a      conditions' can a genetic abnormality be licensed.\u000a    Archard has also conducted underpinning research into the proper role of\u000a      the normative theorist in\u000a      developing and implementing public policy. This has resulted in important\u000a      and entirely original work on\u000a      the nature of `moral compromise' and on the complicity of the public in\u000a      the morally sub-optimal\u000a      decisions of law makers.\u000a    Applied normative theorists trying to change the law and policy in the\u000a      light of their own theory must\u000a      acknowledge that any such changes can only be managed in non-ideal\u000a      contexts. Crucially\u000a      philosophers must make decisions conjointly with non-philosophers and in\u000a      circumstances where the\u000a      views of any individual philosopher need not have any especial or\u000a      determinative weight. Archard acts\u000a      as one Member but the sole philosopher on the Human Fertilisation and\u000a      Embryology Authority. The\u000a      specific and distinctive nature of that contribution is acknowledged. His\u000a      research on `moral\u000a      compromise', the `moral authority' of the philosopher, and complicity in\u000a      non-ideal collective decision-making,\u000a      all directly contribute to the manner in which he has discharged the\u000a      critical role of Chair of the\u000a      Licence, and then Statutory Approvals Committee, guiding its collective\u000a      deliberations to the fair and\u000a      proportionate licensing of genetic conditions.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38428","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The need for high-quality citizenship education in Northern Ireland is\u000d\u000a      made all-the-more acute by\u000d\u000a      the recent history of violence, sectarianism and alienation from the\u000d\u000a      political process.

Paul Carswell, Principal of St Bride's Primary\u000d\u000a      School, Belfast, explains:\u000d\u000a    `We have run the Philosophy for Citizenship course for the past two years\u000d\u000a      in six of our P7\u000d\u000a      classes (approximately 180 children). The course has been of tremendous\u000d\u000a      value to the\u000d\u000a      children. It has been extremely valuable in developing thinking, listening\u000d\u000a      and interpersonal\u000d\u000a      skills. One activity which generated a lot of discussion was when children\u000d\u000a      were given a\u000d\u000a      statement `Who would you forgive?' and had to justify their responses and\u000d\u000a      reach agreement as\u000d\u000a      a group. These kind of moral dilemma activities add real value to the\u000d\u000a      curriculum.'\u000d\u000a    In a similar vein, Elizabeth Smith, Headmistress of Sullivan Upper School\u000d\u000a      Prep Department,\u000d\u000a      Holywood, comments:\u000d\u000a    `We have hosted the Philosophy for Citizenship course for the past two\u000d\u000a      years. Archard and\u000d\u000a      Watkins' work has given the children an important insight into\u000d\u000a      philosophical issues surrounding\u000d\u000a      citizenship. Aside from developing their understanding of questions\u000d\u000a      concerning fairness,\u000d\u000a      responsibility and dealing with the past, it has also had an impact on\u000d\u000a      their ability to work\u000d\u000a      together, negotiate and reason.'\u000d\u000a    Secondly, the research has had an impact on the classroom practice of\u000d\u000a      those teachers who've\u000d\u000a      attended one of the training courses. Of the 15 teachers surveyed\u000d\u000a      following the most recent\u000d\u000a      course in June, 2013, everyone agreed that it would make a positive\u000d\u000a      difference to their subsequent\u000d\u000a      teaching. Ciara Lynch, a primary school teacher from St. Seachnall's\u000d\u000a      National School, Co. Meath,\u000d\u000a      remarks: `The training course was excellent. The teaching resource pack\u000d\u000a      was very helpful. I am\u000d\u000a      trying to use all of these materials in my teaching'. Sarah Wright, a\u000d\u000a      teacher at Victoria Prep\u000d\u000a      School, Belfast, writes: `The Philosophy for Citizenship course has not\u000d\u000a      only improved my class's\u000d\u000a      listening and communication skills, but it has also inspired me to use\u000d\u000a      some of the course materials\u000d\u000a      and ideas elsewhere in my teaching &#8212; for example, as part of drama\u000d\u000a      lessons.'\u000d\u000a    Thirdly, it has had an impact on broader curriculum design. Although\u000d\u000a      obtaining top-down support\u000d\u000a      for a new subject is an extremely slow process, the work has already\u000d\u000a      attracted the attention of the\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland Council for Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment\u000d\u000a      (CCEA). Alan McMurray,\u000d\u000a      Education Manager at the CCEA comments: `lt is worth considering how the\u000d\u000a      Philosophy for\u000d\u000a      Citizenship initiative can be further developed as part of the NI\u000d\u000a      citizenship curriculum'. At the\u000d\u000a      grassroots level, too, a number of teachers have been motivated to press\u000d\u000a      for philosophy within\u000d\u000a      their schools. Vera McClenaghan, a teacher at Hazelwood Integrated Primary\u000d\u000a      School,\u000d\u000a      Newtownabbey, writes that, `as a result of the training course, I am\u000d\u000a      trying to build philosophy into\u000d\u000a      my timetable on a weekly basis', and Paul Taggart, a politics teacher at\u000d\u000a      Sacred Heart Grammar\u000d\u000a      School, Newry, comments that `due to Archard and Watkins' work, I am\u000d\u000a      pressing my senior\u000d\u000a      colleagues to include philosophy as part of our \"Learning for Life and\u000d\u000a      Work\" programme'.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Sustained research on citizenship issues by Professor David Archard and\u000d\u000a      Dr Jeremy Watkins has:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Provided the intellectual content for a Philosophy for Citizenship\u000d\u000a        course which has been\u000d\u000a        undertaken by hundreds of children in schools across Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a        since its inception in\u000d\u000a        January, 2012;\u000d\u000a      Improved children's intellectual and interpersonal skills by promoting\u000d\u000a        better quality\u000d\u000a        reasoning, listening and oral communication;\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    and,\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Delivered a sustainable model of citizenship education that is\u000d\u000a        particularly tailored to the\u000d\u000a        needs of post-conflict societies and that has been embedded in a number\u000d\u000a        of teacher\u000d\u000a        training courses in Northern Ireland.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Queen's University Belfast\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen's University Belfast","InstitutionName":"Queen's University Belfast","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Northern Ireland","UKPRN":10005343}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aArchard, D.

The research undertaken by Professor Archard and Dr Watkins sheds\u000d\u000a      light on both aspects\u000d\u000a      of this challenge, bringing together insights on themes such as\u000d\u000a      responsibility, reparations and\u000d\u000a      forgiveness with normative claims concerning civic status, autonomy and\u000d\u000a      democracy.\u000d\u000a    Watkins' research (Watkins, 2009, 2011; Crawford and Watkins, 2010),\u000d\u000a      which has been crucial in\u000d\u000a      developing the Philosophy for Citizenship course, has concentrated on two\u000d\u000a      questions which are\u000d\u000a      particularly relevant to responsible citizenship in post-conflict\u000d\u000a      societies, namely (1) how should\u000d\u000a      such societies address the legacies of mass violence and human rights\u000d\u000a      violations, and (2) what\u000d\u000a      principles, if any, should be used to apportion blame.\u000d\u000a    In his response to the first of these questions, Watkins has sought to\u000d\u000a      develop a pluralistic approach\u000d\u000a      that acknowledges a place for norms of retribution and reparation whilst\u000d\u000a      at the same time stressing\u000d\u000a      the value of forgiveness both as a self-standing virtue and as a means of\u000d\u000a      promoting civic\u000d\u000a      reconciliation. Among the insights which have emerged from his work has\u000d\u000a      been a clearer account\u000d\u000a      of the forms of conditionality to which forgiveness is subject: against\u000d\u000a      the prevailing orthodoxy, he\u000d\u000a      has argued that forgiveness can be justified in the absence of perpetrator\u000d\u000a      acknowledgement so\u000d\u000a      long as the perpetrator is amenable to future relationships which are\u000d\u000a      based on respect and non-violence.\u000d\u000a    His approach to the second question is motivated by his opposition to an\u000d\u000a      overly abstract way of\u000d\u000a      theorising about collective responsibility. Many of those who write on\u000d\u000a      this subject assume that\u000d\u000a      there is a binary choice between blaming groups for past violence or\u000d\u000a      blaming individuals. Against\u000d\u000a      this opposition, Watkins argues that there isn't a single set of\u000d\u000a      metaphysical facts about\u000d\u000a      responsibility that determines the level at which blame should be assigned\u000d\u000a      but, rather, a number of\u000d\u000a      practical paradigms that permit a differentiated approach towards\u000d\u000a      responsibility. In Crawford and\u000d\u000a      Watkins (2010), for example, he argues that groups should sometimes be\u000d\u000a      blamed for past violence\u000d\u000a      under a `civil law' paradigm of responsibility but not under a `criminal\u000d\u000a      law' paradigm.\u000d\u000a    Archard's contribution to the Philosophy for Citizenship project has been\u000d\u000a      through his research on\u000d\u000a      autonomy, democracy, civic membership and the family. In his recent\u000d\u000a      publications on these\u000d\u000a      subjects (Archard, 2013a and 2013b), he has been concerned with the `best\u000d\u000a      interests' principle,\u000d\u000a      especially as it bears on public policy issues concerning the treatment of\u000d\u000a      children. He has sought\u000d\u000a      to clarify the nature of this principle and to consider its relation to\u000d\u000a      other regulative ideals, such as\u000d\u000a      the public good, the rights of parents and the autonomy of children. In\u000d\u000a      his work on `dirty hands',\u000d\u000a      Archard has also explored the extent to which all citizens within a\u000d\u000a      democracy may be complicit in\u000d\u000a      the evil done by their elected leaders, thus illuminating the issue of\u000d\u000a      political responsibility.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38529","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    There is a political demand that policies are made transparent, but Nudges\u000a      rely on less than fully rational decision-making and they work better when\u000a      their implementation is not made fully transparent to the subjects. Bovens\u000a      has argued that there is a difference between type transparency\u000a      (i.e. transparency about the use of Nudges in policy making) and token\u000a        transparency (i.e. transparency at the time of implementation of a\u000a      particular Nudge). Nudge policies should be type\u000a      transparent and though they need not be token transparent, they do need to\u000a      be in principle token transparent&#8212;i.e. it should be possible\u000a      for an attentive subject to recognise a Nudge at the time of\u000a      implementation. This insight is taken up in a UK House of Lords Behaviour\u000a        Change Report which cites Bovens' work [7] and in key RLI\u000a      recommendations [8, 9].\u000a    In his RLI contribution, Bovens makes a range of specific recommendations\u000a      which are reflected in the RLI's recommendations to the Dutch government:\u000a      (i) behavioural policies should respect the private sphere and life-style\u000a      of citizens, unless there is harm to others; (ii) behavioural policies\u000a      that provide rewards for the targeted behaviour should make sure that the\u000a      rewards are in the same sphere as the targeted behaviour to avoid\u000a      charges of cynicism and manipulation; (iii) government should maximise the\u000a      mitigation of new risks that are introduced due to the institution of\u000a      behavioural policies; (iv) behavioural policies should reach vulnerable\u000a      groups and not encourage segregation and stratification; (v) social\u000a      advertisement should be truthful so as not to erode trust in government;\u000a      (vi) behavioural policies should be seen as part of a mix of policies to\u000a      encourage sustainability (including regulation); (vii) behavioural\u000a      policies are best implemented at a local level; (viii) local initiatives\u000a      must be carefully monitored: There should be a threat of regulation if\u000a      partnerships with businesses fail and outputs should be measured so as to\u000a      identify models of good practice. This contribution is included in a\u000a      document containing three other academic contributions, an overview, and a\u000a      set of policy recommendations by the RLI and was approved by the RLI in\u000a      June 2013. The material has been communicated to Dutch policy makers and\u000a      it is at the core of the RLI's advice [8, 9] to the Dutch government and\u000a      parliament.\u000a    The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) advises the Dutch\u000a      Government on the climate adaptation policy which is embodied in their\u000a      Delta Programme [10]. In 2012, they published the \"Advisory Board Report:\u000a      KNMY'13 Scenarios\". In 2011\/2012, the Chief Scientist of the PBL\u000a      Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, Professor Petersen, who is\u000a      also a core member of the KNMI Advisory Board, approached the LSE Climate\u000a      Modelling Group (CMG) for advice on what kinds of evidence should form the\u000a      basis of future climate policy decisions. Should the KNMI follow recent\u000a      trends and adopt a probabilistic approach, or should it follow a\u000a      scenario-based approach? This issue is pressing in the UK as well, because\u000a      the UK government has opted to endorse a probabilistic approach and funds\u000a      a large scale project (UKCP09) that provides decision makers with\u000a      fine-grained probabilistic forecasts for future values of a number of\u000a      decision-relevant weather variables.\u000a    The LSE group's research shows that the scenario-based approach is\u000a      preferable because probabilistic approaches make claims that are not\u000a      warranted by the scientific evidence. Furthermore, the content of reports\u000a      based on probabilistic approaches is conveyed to the citizens through the\u000a      media in such a way that they do not become aware of the severity of the\u000a      situation which leads to inaction among politicians and policy makers on\u000a      the ground. Scenario-based approaches display both a higher level of\u000a      scientific sincerity and accountability and warrant greater penetration to\u000a      the citizen base.\u000a    Petersen has been affiliated with LSE as a Visiting Professor since 2009\u000a      [11]. Through his interaction with LSE CMG he has become convinced of the\u000a      perils of probabilistic climate predictions and shares the group's\u000a      rejection of such methods as a basis for decisions in public policy. He\u000a      had a crucial influence on the contents of the Advisory Board Report [12].\u000a      He communicated the LSE CMG's critical outlook to the Board.\u000a      Notwithstanding considerable pressure to adopt the now-fashionable\u000a      probabilistic approach, KNMI has decided not to do so and its choice for a\u000a      scenario-based approach permeates the document.\u000a    We do not pretend that there was a one-way street from the LSE CMG\u000a      research over Peterson's intervention to the KNMI's final position. Ideas\u000a      are born and developed in context with mutual enrichment. But the import\u000a      of the LSE CMG's work and Frigg's co-authored publications is substantial,\u000a      as is clearly evidenced in the attached letter by Peterson [13].\u000a    Our work has had an impact on the terms of the debate and on the content\u000a      of the advice to policy makers offered by the RLI [8 and 9] and the KNMI\u000a      [13 and 14]. Why does this impact matter? First, RLI's\u000a      recommendations set out the potential and moral scope of behavioural\u000a      policies in the Netherlands, which has so far been relatively averse to\u000a      such policies in comparison to, say, the UK and Germany. Such policies\u000a      leave the choice set intact and hence respect freedom and they stimulate\u000a      the search for creative local solutions, Second, LSE CMG's work, through\u000a      the KNMI advice, counteracts a recent international trend towards\u000a      probabilistic climate forecasting as a basis for policy making.

He lays out a set of conditions on what constitutes a Nudge\u000a      and examines the many variables that enter into determining the\u000a      permissibility of a Nudge. For example, one should consider (i)\u000a      whether particular Nudges respect reflective preferences; (ii)\u000a      whether they infantilise the citizenry and hamper the opportunity to\u000a      develop moral character; (iii) whether there is a democratic mandate for\u000a      the policies in question; (iv) whether there is less or more urgency to\u000a      the situation, (v) to what extent autonomy is respected; and (vi) whether\u000a      they respect a requirement of transparency on governmental agency. Bovens\u000a      [2] discusses the constraint of respect for autonomy in Nudge\u000a      policies. Bovens [3] extends [1] and [2] to behavioural policies in the\u000a      area of sustainability. He creates a taxonomy and constructs a database of\u000a      behavioural policies in areas of sustainability, including recycling, food\u000a      waste, domestic energy usage and transport. He lays out ethical\u000a      constraints on the implementation of such policies, in particular, how to\u000a      deal with (i) the imposition of new risks; (ii) threats to various\u000a      vulnerable groups; and (iii) violations of privacy and truthfulness. This\u000a      discussion leads to a number of recommendations concerning the duties of\u000a      and caveats for government in instituting behavioural policies in the area\u000a      of sustainability.\u000a    The LSE climate modelling group was formed in 2009 when Frigg and Leonard\u000a      Smith (Director of the Centre for the Analysis of Time Series at LSE)\u000a      started collaborating on a project about the epistemic warrant for climate\u000a      predictions which would ground policy making in evidence. Political\u000a      decisions have to be taken long before climate predictions become\u000a      testable, and so we have to act on predictions before there is empirical\u000a      evidence supporting them. This poses a special challenge to evidence-based\u000a      policy making towards climate change.\u000a    Increasingly, climate predictions handed down to policy makers are\u000a      fine-grained probabilistic predictions, specifying the\u000a      probabilities that certain specific local events will occur. Using state\u000a      of the art climate models, uncertainty about parameters and initial\u000a      conditions is turned into outcome probabilities, and these probabilities\u000a      are offered to policy makers and the general public as decision relevant\u000a      information. The UK's climate policy is almost entirely based on such\u000a      probabilities (generated by UKCP09), and there is an international trend\u000a      towards adapting these probabilistic methods.\u000a    But is there epistemic warrant for such predictions? The project has\u000a      studied the methodology behind such predictions and found that they lack\u000a      robustness and can be seriously misleading in policy making. In climate\u000a      models two problems come together, viz. chaos and model error, with the\u000a      consequence that probabilities in the model may have little connection\u000a      with the real world. This conclusion is supported both (i) by arguments\u000a      showing that probabilities are the wrong tool to capture uncertainties in\u000a      climate models; and (ii) by simulations in a simple system where the\u000a      mismatch between model-probabilities and the system's behaviour become\u000a      easily palpable. Instead, it is recommended that (a) climate scientists\u000a      use model-based reasoning to formulate different plausible scenarios;\u000a      that (b) decisions about adaptation are taken on the basis of these\u000a      scenarios; and that (c) information to the citizenry is disseminated in\u000a      these terms [4, 5 and 6]. Bovens and Frigg are both members of LSE's\u000a      Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, which\u000a      in turn has fostered conversations and linkages between their research\u000a      projects. Bovens' work on risk in the context of sustainability is\u000a      informed by uncertainty management in policy making. Frigg's work on\u000a      knowledge representation of climate change predictions securing optimal\u000a      end-user uptake is informed by behavioural insights.\u000a    Key Researchers: Bovens has been at LSE since 2004; Frigg since\u000a      2003.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38769","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Commission Report (see Sources 10 and 11) draws on and was informed\u000d\u000a      by several\u000d\u000a      publications on which Fleurbaey worked at LSE.

It is proposed that about 50 concrete actions will be carried out\u000d\u000a      by 2020.\"\u000d\u000a    Among other things, the European Statistical System (ESS) commits itself\u000d\u000a      to:\u000d\u000a    a. The introduction of new cross-country standardised measures of the\u000d\u000a      following goods: non-market\u000d\u000a      consumption; leisure time; financial fragility; health; the quality of\u000d\u000a      social\u000d\u000a      relationships; and subjective well-being.\u000d\u000a    b. New multi-dimensional measures of quality of life. The latter include\u000d\u000a      new data on \"material\u000d\u000a      living conditions, productive and valued activities (incl. work), health,\u000d\u000a      education, leisure and\u000d\u000a      social interactions, economic, job and physical insecurity, governance and\u000d\u000a      basic rights,\u000d\u000a      natural and living environment as well as overall experience of life\"\u000d\u000a      [Source 13, p. 21].\u000d\u000a    c. Assess inequalities in these indicators in a comprehensive way [Source\u000d\u000a      13, p. 21].\u000d\u000a    For several reasons, these changes are of great importance. First, by\u000d\u000a      making available new,\u000d\u000a      reliable, cross-country comparable indices of many aspects of well-being,\u000d\u000a      the ESS will allow public\u000d\u000a      debate and decision-making to draw on more than just the established\u000d\u000a      indicators, which have\u000d\u000a      traditionally focused on economic matters, such as income and employment.\u000d\u000a      Second, the richer,\u000d\u000a      standardized data on the distribution of key indicators in the population\u000d\u000a      will allow for a better-informed\u000d\u000a      debate on distributive issues, including the extent and badness of\u000d\u000a      particular inequalities\u000d\u000a      within and between particular member states and the sensitivity of\u000d\u000a      inequality to policies in different\u000d\u000a      states. Third, the resources of the ESS will be devoted to valuable\u000d\u000a      innovation in the space of social\u000d\u000a      indicators. In sum, these commitments by the ESS are an important step\u000d\u000a      towards ending what the\u000d\u000a      Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission called the \"mis-measuring of our lives\"\u000d\u000a      and the impoverishment\u000d\u000a      of public debate and policy-making that stems from an excessive focus on\u000d\u000a      average attainment and\u000d\u000a      on economic indicators.\u000d\u000a    2. Public debates around the world\u000d\u000a    The Report of the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance\u000d\u000a      and Social\u000d\u000a      Progress was launched on September 14, 2009. It had an immediate impact on\u000d\u000a      the debate among\u000d\u000a      the public, opinion-makers, politicians and global institutions. The\u000d\u000a      report was published on major\u000d\u000a      newspapers' websites, and was discussed extensively by at least 60 leading\u000d\u000a      newspapers around\u000d\u000a      world, including the Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, Time,\u000d\u000a      etc. (See Source [14].) Several major\u000d\u000a      conferences on the report were organised, including by the Bertelsmann\u000d\u000a      Stiftung in Berlin and the\u000d\u000a      OECD in Paris (see Sources [15] and [16]). As of September 2013, according\u000d\u000a      to Google Scholar,\u000d\u000a      the report has been cited in academic research and government institutes'\u000d\u000a      documents over 1000\u000d\u000a      times.\u000d\u000a    3. Policy debates in international and national organisations\u000d\u000a    The work Fleurbaey undertook for the Commission and at LSE has led to\u000d\u000a      further policy-relevant\u000d\u000a      use of his ideas:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      In recognition of the importance of Fleurbaey's contribution to the\u000d\u000a        Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi\u000d\u000a        Commission, he was appointed to the Working Group III of the IPCC, 5th\u000d\u000a        Assessment Report\u000d\u000a        (2010-2014). Chapter 3 of this Working Group's report (on Social,\u000d\u000a        Economic and Ethical\u000d\u000a        Concepts) is strongly influenced by work Fleurbaey did at LSE; he is\u000d\u000a        coordinating lead author\u000d\u000a        of Chapter 4 (on Sustainability and Equity).\u000d\u000a      In France, steps towards using the \"equivalent incomes\" approach\u000d\u000a        advocated by Fleurbaey in\u000d\u000a        the reimbursement of medicines were discussed with Fleurbaey at the\u000d\u000a        French Health Care\u000d\u000a        Authority (Haute Autorit&#233; de Sant&#233;) on 30\/10\/2012 and at the French\u000d\u000a        Parliament on\u000d\u000a        22\/11\/2012 with his co-author Prof. Erik Schokkaert (see Source [17]).\u000d\u000a        (Schokkaert held the\u000d\u000a        2012-13 Belgian Chair in the LSE Philosophy Department and is currently\u000d\u000a        a Visiting Professor.)\u000d\u000a      Schokkaert and Bovens ran a conference on Fleurbaey and Schokkaert's\u000d\u000a        work in June 2013\u000d\u000a        with participation of the UK Office of National Statistics and the OECD\u000d\u000a        (see Source [18].)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    These impacts are important for several reasons. Politicians and the\u000d\u000a      public rightly want to know: (i)\u000d\u000a      what matters to the quality of individuals' lives; (ii) how to measure the\u000d\u000a      things that matter; (iii) how\u000d\u000a      these things are distributed in the population; and (iv) how they\u000d\u000a      should be distributed on grounds of\u000d\u000a      fairness. Through his work at the Commission, the IPCC, and his engagement\u000d\u000a      with policy-makers,\u000d\u000a      Fleurbaey's research at LSE has impacted on all four issues. Fleurbaey's\u000d\u000a      collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      department on these research topics remains close&#8212;he has co-published on\u000d\u000a      these topics with\u000d\u000a      Voorhoeve, Bovens, and Schokkaert.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Marc Fleurbaey was appointed to the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi\u000d\u000a      Commission (instituted by\u000d\u000a      President Sarkozy) on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social\u000d\u000a      Progress during\u000d\u000a      2007-09. His work at the LSE on measures of the quality of life and on\u000d\u000a      criteria for the fair allocation\u000d\u000a      of resources significantly shaped the Commission's thinking and had three\u000d\u000a      forms of impact.

He argued that\u000d\u000a      leading justifications for using GDP as an indicator of citizens'\u000d\u000a      wellbeing and command over the\u000d\u000a      resources they need to pursue their plans of life were seriously flawed.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, he critically\u000d\u000a      reviewed the case for proposed alternative indicators. The paper presented\u000d\u000a      a comprehensive\u000d\u000a      analysis of existing arguments for and against various indicators and\u000d\u000a      offered new justifications for\u000d\u000a      some of these measures [1]. This document was circulated in the Commission\u000d\u000a      and discussed in its\u000d\u000a      first meeting [see Sources 10 and 11]. The Commission's report follows [1]\u000d\u000a      in arguing that the\u000d\u000a      standard attempted justifications for using GDP as an indicator of\u000d\u000a      individual well-being or as an\u000d\u000a      indicator of individuals' command of important resources are unsuccessful.\u000d\u000a      The report also follows\u000d\u000a      Fleurbaey's argument that the following three alternatives to GDP are\u000d\u000a      especially worth developing:\u000d\u000a    (1) An \"equivalent income\" approach. This measure is an individual's\u000d\u000a      current income minus the\u000d\u000a      amount she would be willing to pay to have a reference level of\u000d\u000a      non-monetary quality of life along\u000d\u000a      various dimensions. For example, suppose the reference non-monetary\u000d\u000a      quality of life is perfect\u000d\u000a      health. Also suppose Jones has an actual income of &#163;30,000 and has poor\u000d\u000a      health. Jones would be\u000d\u000a      willing to give up &#163;17,000 to be in perfect health. Then her equivalent\u000d\u000a      income is &#163;30,000 &#8212; &#163;17,000\u000d\u000a      = &#163;13,000. She will then be considered worse off than Smith, who has an\u000d\u000a      income of &#163;15,000 and\u000d\u000a      is in perfect health. This approach has a long history in welfare\u000d\u000a      economics. While at LSE,\u000d\u000a      Fleurbaey provided a new theoretical justification for its use in\u000d\u000a      combination with an egalitarian\u000d\u000a      criterion for judging the distribution of equivalent incomes. (In brief,\u000d\u000a      Fleurbaey argued that ranking\u000d\u000a      social states by a fair distribution of equivalent incomes follows if one\u000d\u000a      weakens one of the axioms\u000d\u000a      of Arrow's famous \"Impossibility Theorem\" and adds an axiom that captures\u000d\u000a      a concern for equality;\u000d\u000a      see, e.g. [1], sec. 4 and [2].) Moreover, he rebutted well-known critiques\u000d\u000a      of this criterion. (Among\u000d\u000a      others, Sen had criticised it for its alleged insensitivity to individual\u000d\u000a      variations in need. Fleurbaey\u000d\u000a      argued that one can make the measure sensitive to any number of relevant\u000d\u000a      personal variables,\u000d\u000a      such as physical health, education, etc.) He also did new applied work\u000d\u000a      ([3] and [4]).\u000d\u000a    (2) A \"subjective well-being\" approach. This draws on both cognitive\u000d\u000a      evaluations&#8212;what people\u000d\u000a      think of their life, e.g. in answer to \"ladder-of-life\" questionnaires\u000d\u000a      asking respondents to rank their\u000d\u000a      life on a scale between 0 (worst possible life) and 10 (best possible\u000d\u000a      life)&#8212;and on affective reports\u000d\u000a      (e.g. how they report feeling during particular life episodes).\u000d\u000a    (3) The \"capability approach\" propounded by Amartya Sen. The two key\u000d\u000a      terms in the approach are\u000d\u000a      \"functionings\" and \"capability sets\" and they are defined as follows.\u000d\u000a      \"Functioning\" is a catchword for\u000d\u000a      any doing or being in the life of an individual, such as a consumption\u000d\u000a      bundle, a health condition, or\u000d\u000a      a level of education, and so on. At any moment in life, or over the whole\u000d\u000a      life cycle, the actual\u000d\u000a      situation of an individual can be described by a functioning vector. A\u000d\u000a      \"capability set\" is the set of\u000d\u000a      potential functioning vectors that an individual can obtain if he so\u000d\u000a      chooses. Fleurbaey's [1], [5] and\u000d\u000a      [6] advanced the debate on measuring such capability sets, criticising\u000d\u000a      some proposed measures\u000d\u000a      and proposing new ones.\u000d\u000a    Finally, the report's criticism of average indicators (such as GDP per\u000d\u000a      capita) and advocacy of\u000d\u000a      indicators that focus on the whole distribution and that highlight\u000d\u000a      inequality and the plight of the\u000d\u000a      worst off was shaped by Fleurbaey's input to the deliberations. His\u000d\u000a      advocacy of egalitarian\u000d\u000a      measures drew on the contributions he made to the theory of fair\u000d\u000a      distribution during his time as a\u000d\u000a      Lachmann Fellow (see [2], [7], [8] and [9]).\u000d\u000a    Key Researcher: Fleurbaey was a Lachmann Fellow in the Philosophy\u000d\u000a      Department from 2006-09.\u000d\u000a      This is a prestigious research position remunerated through the LSE\u000d\u000a      payroll. As a staff member of\u000d\u000a      the LSE, he was submitted for the 2008 RAE. Fleurbaey was also a Visiting\u000d\u000a      Professor in the 2009-10\u000d\u000a      academic year.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38901","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of Widdows's research is most clearly evident in her\u000a      appointment and work on the EGC of UKB (2007-2013). UKB is a 30-year\u000a      epidemiological study building the world's largest information and\u000a      material resource in its area and has recruited half a million UK citizens\u000a      (c.2% of the 40-69 eligible age group).UKB's funders include the Wellcome\u000a      trust, the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Department of Health (DoH),\u000a      the Scottish Government, the Northwest Regional Development Agency, Welsh\u000a      Assembly Government and the British Heart Foundation. UKB is the first of\u000a      its size and type and its significance is attested to by the media\u000a      coverage it has received. Over 20 features by the BBC and features in most\u000a      broadsheets, including The Guardian, The Financial Times, Nature\u000a      and New Scientist. (Further details at: http:\/\/www.ukbiobank.ac.uk\/news-\u000a        releases\/). It is the first biobank of its type to abandon informed\u000a      consent and accordingly UKB is developing new forms of governance which\u000a      are being adopted globally and as a member of the EGC Widdows has made\u000a        major contributions to the development of the policy and practice of UKB\u000a        and in the ethical practices adopted by UKB.\u000a    As a member of the EGC Widdows has fed directly into the policy\u000a        development of UKB. The EGC is not a `policy commission' or an\u000a      academic body or thinktank, but an independent body designed to evolve new\u000a      ethics and governance appropriate to the new structures developed by UKB.\u000a      It is demanding with at least 4 full council meetings a year and numerous\u000a      sub-group meetings and public meetings. Widdows was selected as a member\u000a      of the ECG because of her expertise and research track record in the area\u000a      of genetic ethics and governance and was interviewed by representatives\u000a      from the DoH, the Chair of the MRC and the Chair of the Wellcome Trust.\u000a      Widdows was appointed via a rigorous selection process over many more\u000a      senior academics, precisely because of her research on genetic ethics,\u000a      particularly on rethinking consent, and her interest in the public good;\u000a      and these matters were discussed in the meeting (research in the PropEur\u000a      project, and particularly R1, R2, R4 &amp; R5). Members usually serve for\u000a      a 3 or 4 year period, but Widdows was asked to extend her membership given\u000a      her pivotal role in the development of the UKB's access policies.\u000a    Widdows has had impact in the following ways:\u000a    \u000a      In the critique of informed consent for biobanking and genetic\u000a          research in general;\u000a      In policy recognition that standard ethical procedures fail in\u000a          biobanking;\u000a      In development of new ethical models;\u000a      In promoting the public good as an ethical justification;\u000a      In making the public good and public interest key ethical criteria.\u000a    \u000a    As explained in section 2, informed consent is not appropriate for\u000a      biobanks. Widdows' critique and her work on new forms of governance\u000a      (particularly in the ProEur project) contributed to her appointment to the\u000a      EGC. Widdows has had distinctive impact in showing UKB the\u000a        implications of having broad consent rather than informed consent\u000a      (see [2] - publicly available minutes from meetings 18, 20 and 21). This\u000a      recognition that informed consent is not appropriate for biobanking was\u000a      the reason she was invited to be the UK representative and keynote speaker\u000a      at the World Medical Association `Expert Conference on the revision of the\u000a      Declaration of Helsinki' (Tokyo, 2013). This Declaration is the code that\u000a      governs research globally and sets ethical standards against which all\u000a      researchers are judged. Widdows gave the keynote address to an audience\u000a      which included the international Chair of the World Medical Association\u000a      and chairs of all the national medical associations as well as significant\u000a      policy lobbyists (including government representatives from Japan and US)\u000a      and lobbyists from Pharmaceutical companies. She was invited to speak precisely\u000a      because her work on revising consent and genetics (especially with regard\u000a      to biobanks) is setting world agendas. In the recent draft version of\u000a        the Declaration of Helsinki (now released for consultation, see [3])\u000a        biobanks are explicitly mentioned for the first time. The suggested\u000a      revision recognises Prof. Widdows' claim that these are \"exceptional\u000a      situations where consent would be impossible or impractical\" (Clause 32 of\u000a      the current consultation document). In addition to having impact in\u000a      ensuring the failure of informed consent is recognised she has had impact\u000a        on the development of new ethical models which do not rely on\u000a      informed consent, such as that adopted by UKB. Her impact in the\u000a      development of these in UKB, and her insistence that UKB continue to\u000a      consider alternative models such as benefit- and\/or profit-sharing can be\u000a      seen in the minutes of the committee (see [2] and minutes from meetings 16\u000a      and 26).\u000a    Crucial to the new governance model adopted by UKB is the foregrounding\u000a        of public good and the role this plays as an ethical criterion when\u000a      informed consent is not used. Widdows' role, as key stakeholders in the\u000a      process have attested, has been pivotal in ensuring that UKB understands\u000a      the extent of the public good requirement of the biobank's aim, namely\u000a      that all research must be demonstrably in the public interest and that\u000a      this is ascertained before access is granted (see [7] and [8]). Shown in\u000a      minutes from meetings 14, 20, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30 ([2]). This impact\u000a        is shown in the final access policy and processes which require that\u000a      public good criteria are met for access to be granted. Widdows' work in\u000a      its development are shown in minutes from meetings 14, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26,\u000a      27, 28, 29 and 30.\u000a    Further evidence for all this impact can be attained from the respective\u000a      Chairs and secretary. For instance, one former Chair of ECG states, \"had\u000a      she not been so relentlessly insistent about the responsibilities of both\u000a      the EGC and UKB, as trustees for the interests of participants as well as\u000a      being stewards for the public interest, it is unlikely that the\u000a        resulting Protocol would have been as explicit as it is in embedding\u000a        these interests\". Likewise the Secretary states, \"It was Heather,\u000a      with full backing of the access subgroup, that proposed an extension to\u000a      this exception to include Intellectual Property Rights that are being used\u000a      to restrict access to health-care unreasonably. The proposed extension\u000a        has been adopted by UK Biobank\" and \"I believe that through\u000a      Heather's input the `public interest' features more prominently in the\u000a      access procedures than it would otherwise have done\".\u000a    Taken together Widdows has shaped policy-making both nationally and\u000a      internationally:\u000a    \u000a      As a key member of the IP and Access Sub-Group of the EGC\u000a      As a keynote speaker 2013 World Medical Association Conference feeding\u000a        into the redrafting of the Declaration of Helsinki (the code governing\u000a        research globally)\u000a    \u000a    In these arenas her work on consent, trust and genetic governance has\u000a      shaped understandings of genetic ethics, which has created new policy:\u000a    \u000a      Nationally in the development of the policies and processes of UKB\u000a      Internationally, as the processes and lessons of UKB are taken up by\u000a        other biobanks &#8212; demonstrated by the interest in UKB as the first of its\u000a        kind from international consortia (such as the P3G &#8212; Public Population\u000a        Project in Genetics).\u000a      Internationally, in her impact on the revision of the Declaration of\u000a        Helsinki in the explicit mention of biobanks in the current draft.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Widdows has shaped policy-making in areas of genetic ethics and\u000a      especially biobanking.

It includes a monograph, a co-edited collection\u000a      and a journal special issue, and over ten single and co-authored journal\u000a      articles and book chapters. The impact of her research is global as\u000a      biobanks are being developed nationally and regionally, and new and\u000a      appropriate methods of ethics and governance for genetic data and biobanks\u000a      are urgent necessities (informed consent is ineffective for biobanking\u000a      ethics and governance).\u000a    Widdows' research begins with issues of genetic ethics, property and the\u000a      body generally (from 2000 onwards) and develops a more focused concern for\u000a      the emerging phenomenon of biobanking and population genetics (from around\u000a      2005 and continuing). The research was carried out through individual\u000a      research and production of papers and chapters &#8212; highlighting the\u000a      inadequacy of current ethical frameworks to address the issues of the\u000a      genetic era, particularly those which are emerging in biobanking &#8212; as well\u000a      as in collaborative projects. The key collaborative research emerged from\u000a      two EC-funded projects (details below). Widdows was PI of the first\u000a      project, PropEur, which focused on alternative models of governance, with\u000a      a focus on the genome, then Co-I on the second project, Tiss.EU,\u000a      responsible for the theme of `biobanking'. Both projects involved\u000a      stakeholder groups and spanned the theory, policy and practice spectrum.\u000a      Participants in the project workshops included academics from many\u000a      disciplines as well as policy-makers, members of NGOs and activists in\u000a      order to ensure that recommendations and conclusions were as relevant and\u000a      practical as possible. Appropriate ethics for biobanks, and for genetic\u000a      data, is a focus throughout this body of work and in the latest\u000a      publication The Connected Self (see R1 below).\u000a    Research findings:\u000a    \u000a      that current frameworks of ethics and governance are inadequate in the\u000a        genetic era, as are current `gold-standard' practices of informed\u000a        consent and confidentiality.\u000a      that while problematic in general in genetic ethics, consent and\u000a        confidentiality are particularly problematic when it comes to\u000a        biobanking. This is for two main reasons: first, consent is `one- off',\u000a        and cannot address the future-orientated and long-term nature of\u000a        biobanks; second, consent can never meet the criteria to count as\u000a        `informed' (as required by policy documents such as the Declaration\u000a          of Helsinki) as at the time of consent it is not known what\u000a        research will be undertaken using the participants' samples and data.\u000a      that alternative frameworks such as the `Trust' model (being put into\u000a        practice for the first time in UKB), should be trialed, tested, and\u000a        amended as possible alternatives to informed consent.\u000a      that to understand why it is difficult to introduce new frameworks one\u000a        must understand the dominance of the `choice model' (the reliance on the\u000a        practice of consent) and the `fear of paternalism'.\u000a    \u000a    This research speaks to a current fault-line in contemporary public\u000a      ethics, that of how to balance individual rights against public goods, for\u000a      instance in the security debate (civil liberties v. security) and the\u000a      environmental debate (future generations and sustainability v. individual\u000a      freedom). This research questions these dichotomies and suggests that if\u000a      one uses alternative frameworks, such as trust, then there is less\u000a      conflict between individual rights and common goods.\u000a    All this work was conducted while Widdows was a full time member of staff\u000a      at Birmingham University (she took up a post in 2000 as a Research Fellow,\u000a      became a lecturer in 2003, as SL in 2005 and a Professor in 2009).

By raising awareness about the ethical issues emerging in\u000d\u000a      these contexts and providing clear recommendations, University of\u000d\u000a      Birmingham research (see R2-R4 above) contributed to:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000athe creation of ethically informed and ethically sound professional\u000d\u000a          codes of conduct for the use of counter-terrorism and\u000d\u000a        border-control technology (e.g., in the case of FRONTEX see source 2\u000d\u000a        below);\u000d\u000a      \u000aknowledge of possible infringement of human rights that police\u000d\u000a        officers require when using such technology and reviewing and\u000d\u000a        authorising surveillance applications (source 2).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    As a result of the closed meetings described above, organised and\u000d\u000a      coordinated by the University of Birmingham, the project promoted exchange\u000d\u000a      of ideas between different users, and significantly enhanced the\u000d\u000a        participants' understanding and appreciation of the ethics of\u000d\u000a      counter-terrorism technology and measures (sources 1-4). The long-term\u000d\u000a      impact of the research, however, is likely to be much broader. University\u000d\u000a      of Birmingham research not only has informed the use and review of existing\u000d\u000a      counter-terrorism technologies, but will also inform the design of new\u000d\u000a        technologies. At the meetings, technology developers were able to\u000d\u000a      obtain direct feedback on their products from end users (the\u000d\u000a      counter-terrorism professionals) and from researchers, and the suggestions\u000a        made contributed to the implementation of privacy solutions in\u000d\u000a        developers' products. For instance, one attendee attests: `this\u000d\u000a      forum did contribute to the evolution of our privacy solution during the\u000d\u000a      further development of our... product' (source 4). It is also hoped\u000d\u000a      therefore, that future products will be more likely to respond to the\u000d\u000a      needs of users without compromising the rights of targets in\u000d\u000a      counter-terrorism units.\u000d\u000a    The final project conference organised by the University of Birmingham\u000d\u000a      was held in Brussels in September 2011. The research findings were shared\u000d\u000a      more widely than in the user groups, to representatives from EU member\u000d\u000a      states, IBM and GCHQ and MEPs (70 participants). At the conference a\u000d\u000a      series of policy recommendations were made by DETECTER regarding, for\u000d\u000a      instance, thresholds for authorising surveillance, reliance on automated\u000d\u000a      profiles and the use of watch-lists.

Research conducted as part of the project\u000d\u000a      concerned the ethical and legal implications of detection technology in\u000d\u000a      counter-terrorism. The University of Birmingham led the project, and\u000d\u000a      carried out the work in philosophical ethics which formed the foundation\u000d\u000a      for the project.

Recommendaton Rec (2005) 10 of the\u000d\u000a      Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe suggests that the least\u000d\u000a      intrusive special investigation measures should be used, if at all, only\u000d\u000a      when the prevention or prosecution of serious crime requires it, and not\u000d\u000a      in a way that conflicts with the right of anyone arrested to a fair trial.\u000d\u000a      The principles reflect legal privacy protections under European Convention\u000d\u000a      on Human Rights, Article 8, and Convention 108. It was argued that liberal\u000d\u000a      theory supports the approach of Rec (2005) 10 by permitting the use of\u000d\u000a      special investigative techniques in preventive policing if the crime that\u000d\u000a      these techniques are intended to prevent is very serious, e.g. a terrorist\u000d\u000a      attack. In particular, liberal theory permits the use of secret\u000d\u000a      surveillance, if the choice of targets for the surveillance is\u000d\u000a      evidence-based.\u000d\u000a    Outputs also included ten reports (quarterly updates) to the European\u000d\u000a        Commission on new surveillance technologies. The ten updates have\u000d\u000a      surveyed developments in surveillance technology across Europe, including\u000d\u000a      new products coming to market as well as reporting on the changes to\u000d\u000a      regulation in national legislatures and uses by national governments. The\u000d\u000a      updates have also employed a taxonomy of different moral risks raised by\u000d\u000a      the range of technologies considered.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40328","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Publications. Both of GW's books recount the history of major\u000a      human scourges and the attempts to defeat them in a scientifically\u000a      rigorous fashion, while engaging the general reader as well as health\u000a      professionals. Angel of Death [1] has sold over 3,600 copies,\u000a      making this the second best-selling title in the Palgrave Academic History\u000a      series 2010-13, and the eighth bestselling history title for Palgrave\u000a      since 2000. It was shortlisted for the Wellcome Trust Book Prize 2010, the\u000a      BMA Medical Book Awards 2012 and for the Medical Journalists' Open Book\u000a      Awards 2011. Historian Michael Neve described the book as \"medical history\u000a      at its absolute best\". This book has led to over 60 invitations for GW to\u000a      speak at schools, health professional meetings, history societies and\u000a      literary festivals in Britain and abroad (see below). Paralysed with\u000a        Fear [2] has also garnered positive reviews from the general public,\u000a      professional publications and polio survivors in the short time since its\u000a      publication.

GW has given\u000a      numerous lectures to a variety of audiences in the UK and overseas, on the\u000a      history of smallpox, Jenner and vaccination, and the history of polio. The\u000a      same qualities of clarity, scholarship and accessibility praised in his\u000a      books have also been prominent in feedback from GW's lectures and\u000a      presentations, by both health professional and lay audiences (see below).\u000a      He has also appeared on national and international radio and TV to discuss\u000a      vaccination and smallpox, including the Today Programme (18\/5\/11), BBC\u000a      World Service, BBC World TV and BBC Parliament [b].\u000a    GW has recently given lectures on the history of polio at the Tavistock\u000a      Festival (29\/04\/13), the Edward Jenner Museum (where he was Writer in\u000a      Residence in June 2013), Gresham College (12\/06\/14), the Gladstone Library\u000a      (03\/10\/13), and the Heswall Festival (02\/10\/13). Future presentations\u000a      include the Thackray Medical Museum, Leeds (08\/02\/14). Dr Robert Spencer\u000a      of the Health Protection Agency comments that the audience for GW's\u000a      presentations is \"very widespread &#8212; [including the] general public,\u000a      scientists, medical both junior and senior grades\" [c].\u000a    GW's research has generated impact in several domains:\u000a    1) Engaging health professionals\u000a    GW has given numerous talks on the history of smallpox and polio\u000a      vaccination to physicians, nurses, and other health professionals.\u000a      Selected talks: Milroy Lecture to the Royal College of Physicians, London\u000a      (30\/10\/12); Anglo-French Medical Society (1\/10\/10); Royal College of\u000a      Physicians of Edinburgh (10\/11\/10); Anglo-Swiss Medical Society, Geneva\u000a      (16\/2\/11); Southmead Hospital, Bristol (5\/9\/11); Vaccine Development\u000a      Group, Merck Pharmaceuticals, Pennsylvania, US (11\/11\/11); Infection\u000a      Control Conference, South-West Region, Bristol (29\/5\/12); Rudolf Korec\u000a      Memorial Conference, Topolcianky, Slovakia (21\/2\/13); International Day\u000a      for Fighting Infection, Verona (23\/4\/13). Audience feedback from the 8th\u000a      Annual Infection Control Conference (29\/5\/2012), delivered to 184 NHS\u000a      professionals was very positive. 91% of delegates who responded thought\u000a      that GW's talk was `excellent' or `very good'. Several commented that the\u000a      talk was `very interesting' and GW was described as a `very knowledgeable\u000a      and inspiring speaker' [d].\u000a    GW has run seminars for the Health Protection Agency (29\/11\/10); Centre\u000a      Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne (15\/2\/11); Research Summer\u000a      School, Facult&#233; de M&#233;decine, Angers (10\/7\/11, 3\/7\/12, 1\/7\/13); Bloomberg\u000a      School of Public Health, John Hopkins University, Baltimore (9\/11\/11). Dr\u000a      D.A. Henderson (University of Pittsburgh and Johns Hopkins University)\u000a      commented that in engaging medical professionals GW \"is an especially\u000a      effective advocate\" by his \"open, friendly manner, and his internationally\u000a      respected knowledge of immunization\" [e]. Dr Trevor Thompson (Reader in\u000a      Healthcare Education, University of Bristol) notes that GW \"had a\u000a      considerable impact on the [medical] profession's awareness\" of the\u000a      history of vaccination [g].\u000a    2) Promoting the history of medicine to medical and allied\u000a        professions students\u000a    GW speaks at the Research Summer School, Facult&#233; de M&#233;decine, Universit&#233;\u000a      d'Angers (10\/7\/11, 3\/7\/12, 1\/7\/13). This annual EU-funded workshop brings\u000a      together 70 students in medicine and allied professions from across Europe\u000a      for a residential course. GW has given the introductory lecture at each\u000a      course since its inception. GW lectures students in the Faculty of\u000a      Medicine at the University of Bristol, their only formal lecture on the\u000a      history of medicine.\u000a    3) Engaging the public and schools\u000a    GW has spoken about vaccination in a wide variety of public fora, ranging\u000a      from schools to internationally renowned literary festivals. He has\u000a      addressed audiences of over 100 at the UK's two foremost literary\u000a      festivals, Hay Festival 2010 [g] and The Telegraph's Way with\u000a      Words festival 2011 [h]. Talks at schools include: St. George's School,\u000a      Montreux, Switzerland (14\/2\/11); Mockton Combe School, Bath (8\/3\/11);\u000a      Marlwood School, Thornbury (11\/5\/11); Redland Green, Bristol (13\/9\/11);\u000a      Clifton College, Bristol (4\/5\/12). Timna Lyons, Academic Mentor at Redland\u000a      Green School, notes that student feedback was \"unanimously very positive\",\u000a      citing the following student comments: \"the explanation and stories made\u000a      [the workshop] very interesting\"; \"[the workshop] was very interactive\";\u000a      \"[GW] took real interest in everyone\"; \"use [GW] again\". This evidences\u000a      the success of GW's approach in engaging young people in the history of\u000a      vaccination. He has also given other public lectures, including Thornbury\u000a      Arts Festival (29\/4\/10); University of Bristol Twilight Talks, Watershed,\u000a      Bristol (10\/6\/10); Cyder House Talks, Edward Jenner Museum (22\/7\/10);\u000a      Gladstone Festival, St. Deiniol's Library, Flintshire (9\/9\/10); Thornbury\u000a      Science Festival (7\/7\/11); Tavistock Music and Arts Festival, The Wharf\u000a      Arts Centre, Devon (23\/4\/12); Wellcome Trust series, `Matters of Life and\u000a      Death', Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol (4\/413). GW addressed a public\u000a      audience of over 100 at Gresham College, London. His talk has been viewed\u000a      over 2,300 times [i]. Richard Taverner (r.taverner@gresham.ac.uk)\u000a      reports that numerous requests have been received for a full transcript of\u000a      the lecture. Widespread attention has also been given to GW's media work.\u000a      Public figures such as Clive Anderson (writer and television presenter)\u000a      have positively advocated his work. Dr Henderson noted that Angel of\u000a        Death was \"widely reviewed and quoted\" [e]. It has been warmly\u000a      reviewed in the Times Higher Education Supplement, the Lancet,\u000a      BBC History Magazine, The Times, New Scientist, Laboratory\u000a        News, The Week, and at www.historyextra.com.\u000a    4) Promoting Edward Jenner's legacy\u000a    GW has done much to promote the UK's intellectual heritage by campaigning\u000a      for greater recognition of Edward Jenner, the creator of the smallpox\u000a      vaccine. Unlike Alexander Fleming, who played an analogous role in the\u000a      history of bacterial disease, Jenner's achievement in the prevention of\u000a      viruses has not been sufficiently appreciated in this country. GW was a\u000a      Trustee at Dr Jenner's House, Berkeley (now the Edward Jenner Museum) from\u000a      2009-11 and was the Chair of the Trust from 2010-11 (http:\/\/www.jennermuseum.com\/).\u000a      GW appears in the introductory video at the Jenner Museum and Angel of\u000a      Death is on sale. He is a regular speaker and fundraiser at the museum,\u000a      which receives the royalties from his book. He also speaks at the annual\u000a      Oxford Brookes infectious disease control nursing course held at the\u000a      museum.

This work provided the basis for Angel of\u000a        Death [1], which describes the history of smallpox. This\u000a      110,000-word book is a comprehensive account of smallpox and its\u000a      eradication, from prehistory to the present day, covering the medical,\u000a      scientific, social and political aspects of the disease. The scientific\u000a      and medical basis of smallpox and vaccination are clearly explained and\u000a      the historical and current arguments for and against vaccination presented\u000a      in a balanced fashion. Primary sources included archives at the Edward\u000a      Jenner Museum (Berkeley), the Royal College of Physicians and the Wellcome\u000a      Library (London) and the Gladstone Library (Hawarden), and interviews with\u000a      British experts in smallpox, vaccines and germ warfare. The book has been\u000a      extremely well-received by medical professionals and historians (see\u000a      section 4).\u000a    During 2011-2, GW researched and wrote Paralysed with Fear: the Story\u000a        of Polio [2] (128,000 words). This book is the first comprehensive\u000a      history of polio for over 40 years; the medical, scientific and social\u000a      aspects of the disease are covered comprehensively. The legacy of Polio is\u000a      also examined. The research was assisted by a grant from the Wellcome\u000a      Trust to visit the US to interview leading authorities on polio and\u000a      vaccination. Archives consulted included the Thackray Medical Museum\u000a      (Leeds), the British Polio Fellowship and the College of Physicians\u000a      (Philadelphia); there were also interviews of polio survivors in Britain\u000a      and Hungary.\u000a    A central feature of GW's research has been to identify the sources of\u000a      opposition to vaccination. Since vaccination was first invented by Edward\u000a      Jenner, it has faced strong opposition from a variety of groups. GW has\u000a      also been invited to write articles for the Lancet and the British\u000a        Medical Journal about the history of vaccination, highlighting the\u000a      importance (and neglect) of Jenner and the Edward Jenner Museum [j, k]. He\u000a      supervised numerous medical student projects on the history of medicine,\u000a      including a project on the role of Benjamin Jesty in vaccination, which\u000a      was published as a full paper in the Maltese Medical Journal [3].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40440","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The potential social benefits of life and medical science are at once\u000a      indeterminate and incalculable,\u000a      and the research outlined above has helped to improve the validity and\u000a      hence social value of\u000a      controlled trials around the world. Beneficiaries include both the\u000a      organisers of, and participants in,\u000a      trials themselves, but also extend to all the patients to whom the results\u000a      of those trials apply.\u000a      Edwards' work relates to the considerable number of clinical trials run\u000a      each year. For example, in\u000a      2012, the UK regulator approved 952 applications to run clinical trials of\u000a      new medicinal drugs. In the\u000a      same year, figures from the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)\u000a      show that almost 638,000\u000a      patients volunteered for clinical trials in the UK.\u000a    Those benefits accrue particularly from the use of Edwards' research to\u000a      inform significant changes\u000a      in the guidelines of bodies governing the conduct of research both\u000a      internationally and in individual\u000a      countries (the UK, Europe, US, and Canada), including supporting\u000a      improvements in the\u000a      international governance of cluster trials delivered in developing\u000a      countries. The numbers of such\u000a      trials are increasing as more vaccines, educational and behavioural\u000a      interventions are evaluated. In\u000a      turn, this has led to changes in the ways in which research trials are\u000a      conducted, particularly by\u000a      ensuring the use of a more robust ethical framework for participants.\u000a      Edwards' research has also\u000a      benefited individuals participating in controlled trials by promoting\u000a      autonomous participation\u000a      (especially informed withdrawal) throughout trials &#8212; rather than only at\u000a      the point of consent &#8212; and by\u000a      protecting the rights and interests of individuals in defined communities\u000a      recruited for cluster trials. In\u000a      so doing, the research has helped to address the problem of `missing data'\u000a      from trial drop-outs.\u000a    In 2008 the Canadian National Institute for Health (NIH) funded a project\u000a      [a] to produce the first\u000a      internationally recognised guidelines on the ethics of cluster trials,\u000a      based on Edwards' longstanding\u000a      work on moral problems in such trials. Edwards was invited to join the\u000a      project's Canadian Working\u000a      Group, which met in Ottawa in 2009; this group comprised biostatisticians\u000a      (including the person\u000a      who invented the cluster design), methodologists, trialists, health policy\u000a      professionals from WHO,\u000a      and another bioethicist [1]. The Working Group wrote the Ottawa\u000a        Statement on the ethical conduct\u000a      of cluster trials, with a pr&#233;cis in the BMJ [1], which is used by\u000a      researchers and ethics committees for\u000a      guidance on the design and conduct of such trials. Edwards contributed\u000a      particularly to\u000a      Recommendation 14 of that Statement, which recognises that clusters may\u000a      contain vulnerable\u000a      participants and obliges researchers and ethics committees to consider the\u000a      need for additional\u000a      protections ensuring that consent procedures are appropriate for such\u000a      participants. Furthermore,\u000a      the Statement's fundamental recognition that inequalities may exist within\u000a      clusters, and might be\u000a      exacerbated by participation in the research, is explicitly based on [d]\u000a      (see section 3 in [1]).\u000a    Following the Working Group meeting, its representatives presented the\u000a      resultant Statement,\u000a      including Recommendation 14, at a meeting in July 2013 of the US\u000a      Secretary's Advisory Committee\u000a      on Human Research Protections (SACHRP); this meeting prepared the first\u000a      publicly available\u000a      recommendations in the US on how the US Department of Health and Human\u000a      Services (HHS) and\u000a      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations should be applied to\u000a      cluster trials. These\u000a      recommendations will, for the first time, guide investigators of all\u000a        FDA funded trials of this sort as\u000a      well as their Institutional Review Boards. The SACHRP discussed the\u000a      recommendations at the\u000a      meeting for final approval in October 2013 [2].\u000a    In 2010, Edwards contributed to a World Health Organisation (WHO)\u000a      Working Party set up to\u000a      produce guidelines on the ethics of patient safety research [3]. Those\u000a      guidelines, which were\u000a      published in 2013, provide guidance on patient safety in research taking\u000a      place in resource-poor\u000a      contexts. Recognising that many projects on patient safety resemble\u000a      cluster study designs,\u000a      Edwards' research [d] was cited to support the first guidance point that\u000a      \"vulnerable populations\u000a      should not be differentially exposed to any extra risks brought up by the\u000a      research without good\u000a      reason, to avoid exacerbating inequalities\". This point responded directly\u000a      to the findings in [d].\u000a    As part of her research in Mumbai, Edwards piloted a study of this WHO\u000a      guidance point in an\u000a      international cluster trial of health services. The study was designed to\u000a      develop and test a model\u000a      strategy to improve women's and children's health in 40 Mumbai\u000a      communities; it was funded by the\u000a      Wellcome Trust and led by Dr David Osrin of UCL. The 24,000 households\u000a      recruited, from February\u000a      2012 to present, benefited from access to health services [g].\u000a    In April 2013, the World Medical Association (WMA) released for public\u000a      comment a draft revision of\u000a      the Declaration of Helsinki. Although not binding in itself, it is\u000a      widely recognised as the most\u000a      authoritative guidance for human research ethics, and provides a basis for\u000a      the regulation of\u000a      research around the world. For example, it is enshrined in the EU\u000a      Directive on, and UK regulations\u000a      for, clinical trials which cover all investigational medicinal products.\u000a      Following the release of the\u000a      April 2013 draft revision, and based on her philosophical and empirical\u000a      work, Edwards was invited\u000a      in July 2013 by the Chair of the Working Party to draft a clause on the\u000a      right to withdraw [4].\u000a    Edwards' research has further improved the development and\u000a        implementation of clinical trials\u000a        through its use as the basis for professional training. Again, the\u000a      reach of these impacts\u000a      extends both across and significantly beyond the UK. The National\u000a        Research Ethics Service\u000a      (NRES) oversees the operation of 69 NHS research ethics committees whose\u000a      approval is legally\u000a      required for clinical research projects in the UK. In 2008, Edwards was\u000a      awarded a competitive\u000a      contract to provide research-based training to members of NHS and Social\u000a      Care committees. Since\u000a      2008, she has provided training on consent and its limits for 160\u000a      committee members, based on her\u000a      research and its uptake in professional and legal guidelines [5]. Ninety\u000a      percent of members scored\u000a      the content of her training as 4-6 on a six-point scale.\u000a    This training also led to sustained refinements in the advice\u000a        provided by the NRES. In 2011 the\u000a      NRES training lead, who had attended Edwards' training sessions, included\u000a      her arguments in\u000a      favour of limiting the right to withdraw from research (developed in [a])\u000a      in Article 6.2.2 of NRES'\u000a      official policy document on Participant Information on \"What will happen\u000a      if I don't want to carry on\u000a      with the study?\" [6]. Governed by this document, 10,883 research\u000a        projects were approved by NHS\u000a      and Social Care ethics committees in England between December 2011 and\u000a      March 2013 [7]. The\u000a      recognition of Edwards' framework as best practice is indicated by the\u000a      fact that this Article will be\u000a      retained in a major revision of this document in 2013 [6].\u000a    The Association of Research Ethics Committees (AREC), an\u000a      independent umbrella group for\u000a      research ethics committees, provides training and resources for more than\u000a      2,500 members across\u000a      the UK. In 2012 it invited Edwards to draft a short guide to cluster\u000a      trials after committee members\u000a      asked for guidance on this topic, in light of the increasing numbers of\u000a      cluster trials they were asked\u000a      to review [9]. That draft was approved for publication in early 2013 by\u000a      the AREC board and is now\u000a      increasingly used for training, since AREC organises the full training\u000a      programme for NRES [8].\u000a    Edwards drew on her research to develop and deliver a large-scale\u000a        continuous professional\u000a        development programme on research ethics and governance through UCL\u000a      Partners, an academic\u000a      health-science partnership based in the south-east of England. Between\u000a      2009 and July 2013, she\u000a      trained 493 researchers over 7 one-day events, a substantial component of\u000a      which focused on the\u000a      issue of consent and its limits in research. The training course was rated\u000a      3-5 on a five-point scale\u000a      by 92% of delegates [9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Patients in clinical trials tend to have a very high drop-out rate which\u000a      compromises results.\u000a      Research by Sarah Edwards provided the key ethical framework for limiting\u000a      individual choice in\u000a      designing research involving human subjects.

Herein, the right to\u000a      withdraw is treated as a simple extension of the right to refuse to\u000a      participate all together. Research\u000a      by Dr Sarah J. L. Edwards (Senior Lecturer in Research Ethics and\u000a      Governance at UCL, 2008 &#8212; present)\u000a      explores the moral justifications for limiting individual choice in order\u000a      to improve\u000a      methodological efficiency and promote autonomous participation (especially\u000a      informed withdrawal) in\u000a      different research designs and contexts. Edwards' work has included\u000a      consideration of what consent\u000a      means in research participation and of the adverse effects introduced by\u000a      offering an unconditional\u000a      `right' of withdrawal. She used findings of this work to suggest that\u000a      participants should, at consent,\u000a      assume some responsibility for the internal validity of the trial.\u000a    There are two strands to this research. The first is a philosophical\u000a        analysis of justifications for\u000a        placing limits on a research subject's right to withdraw from\u000a      research once initial consent has\u000a      been granted. In 2011, Edwards developed the idea that research subjects\u000a      should, at the time of\u000a      consent, relinquish some of the (hitherto standard) unconditional rights\u000a      to withdraw. She developed\u000a      a philosophical and legal analysis of contractual relationships between\u000a      researchers and their\u000a      subjects, arguing that subjects cannot be said, individually and\u000a      separately, to assume moral duties\u000a      to future patients simply by consenting to participate in a trial. This is\u000a      because any single subject\u000a      cannot be said to have caused any individual patient harm in the\u000a      future. Rather, a single subject\u000a      contributes only to the statistical problem of missing data (resulting in\u000a      underpowered or biased trial\u000a      evidence), which could then mislead doctors resulting in the prescription\u000a      of ineffective or harmful\u000a      treatments [a]. This argument was based on earlier work (2005) in which\u000a      Edwards developed the\u000a      first philosophical analysis of autonomous participation in research\u000a      (beyond the notion of simple\u000a      consent) by limiting or qualifying rights to withdraw.\u000a    In April-June 2012, she completed a survey of 262 responding members of\u000a      NHS research ethics\u000a      committees, which found that they would welcome her proposal for policies\u000a      specifically qualifying a\u000a      research subject's right to withdraw in the context of weight management\u000a      trials [b]. Methods of\u000a      reducing withdrawal rates included provision of information at consent and\u000a      at the point of\u000a      withdrawal, in emphasising the probable consequences for the results, as\u000a      well as asking those who\u000a      withdraw for their reasons. These methods were piloted in trials conducted\u000a      in July 2011-December\u000a      2012 through the UCL Clinical Trials Unit, including a Bupa funded\u000a      surgical randomised control trial,\u000a      QUEST (Quality of life after mastectomy and breast reconstruction) [c]. A\u000a      focus group discussion in\u000a      July 2013 with patients and the public showed similar support for the case\u000a      to limit subjects' right to\u000a      withdraw from trials.\u000a    The second strand is a philosophical analysis of fair recruitment of\u000a        people to cluster trials,\u000a      wherein consent from individuals to be randomly allocated, in groups or\u000a      clusters, to treatments is\u000a      limited to a greater or lesser extent. Cluster trials involve\u000a      allocating groups (rather than individuals)\u000a      to receive different treatments. In 2011, Edwards developed her\u000a      preliminary taxonomy of consent\u000a      by clarifying the options open to individual members of clusters and\u000a      exploring the feasibility of\u000a      individuals withdrawing from treatments assigned to these clusters. This,\u000a      the first philosophical\u000a      analysis of fair recruitment to cluster trials, explained their tendency,\u000a      over traditional randomised\u000a      controlled trials (RCTs), to exacerbate pre-existing inequalities between\u000a      groups, showing why\u000a      standard measures of redressing inequalities in research ex post\u000a      may not be helpful [d]. How\u000a      clusters are identified and selected may be partially determined by their\u000a      statistical efficiency (the\u000a      fewer individuals within each cluster, the better). Edwards argues that\u000a      this concern should be\u000a      balanced against the perceived strength and social cohesion of\u000a      pre-existing communities, and the\u000a      consequences for overall health status. These questions can be gauged\u000a      empirically through\u000a      community engagement exercises. In Autumn 2012 Edwards and Dr David Osrin\u000a      (UCL Institute for\u000a      Global Health) organised the study of a target cluster trial, involving\u000a      health resource centres in\u000a      Mumbai, where groups were defined by geographical landmarks between\u000a      dwellings for\u000a      convenience. For this trial, the researchers enrolled 40 Mumbai slum\u000a      communities of at least\u000a      24,000 households [e].\u000a    However, the problem of showing what needs to happen for the just\u000a      treatment of patients in cluster\u000a      trials, and what choices individuals should be allowed to make, might\u000a      depend critically on the\u000a      context within which the need for research arises. Edwards subsequently\u000a      showed that, during a\u000a      public health emergency involving a new pathogen, cluster trials could\u000a      better respond to problems\u000a      of justice than can traditional RCTs because cluster trials allow the\u000a      introduction of new treatments\u000a      incrementally (to groups which are already segregated to contain the\u000a      communicable disease)\u000a      thereby better respecting individuals' right to health [f].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41074","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the research on the education and curating programmes of\u000a      three international art\u000a      institutions in the UK, Norway and Italy, and on associated public\u000a      discourses, has been via a\u000a      sustained process of both public engagement (though public lectures and\u000a      catalogue essays) and\u000a      institutional engagement (via consultancy and curation). Insofar as the\u000a      modes of public and\u000a      institutional engagement involved represent innovations in the educational\u000a      and artistic\u000a      programming of the institutions concerned, they constitute impact on those\u000a      institutions themselves.\u000a      These impacts occurred between January 2008 and July 2013.\u000a    The beneficiaries\u000a    The main non-academic beneficiaries of the research have been:\u000a    (i) the Adult Programmes Department of Tate Britain, 2008-10;\u000a    (ii) the Office for Contemporary Art Norway (OCA), 2009-11;\u000a    (iii) the Norwegian Representation at the 54th Venice\u000a      Biennale, 2010-11;\u000a    What changed?\u000a    (i) Adult Programmes, Education Department, Tate Britain, 2008-10\u000a    The research influenced adult educational programming at Tate Britain\u000a      through the introduction of\u000a      a focus on the philosophical aspects of contemporary art, including\u000a      specifically, (a) the conceptual\u000a      character of contemporary art, and (b) an enrichment of the understanding\u000a      of the importance of\u000a      broader intellectual contexts &#8212; philosophical and cultural-theoretical &#8212;\u000a      to the understanding of\u000a      contemporary art. This represented a break with previous programming\u000a      practices, which were\u000a      focused more narrowly on art history, connected to Tate Britain's\u000a      collection, and more general\u000a      introductory topics.\u000a    The main means through which this was effected were: (a) consultancy\u000a      (Osborne was a consultant\u000a      to Tate Britain, Adult Programmes for the international conference,\u000a      `Global Modernities', connected\u000a      to the Tate Triennial, 2009, and for the talks series that he subsequently\u000a      designed, `Anthropologies\u000a      of the Present', 2009-10); and (b) public lectures at Tate Britain\u000a      in 2008 &amp; 2009. After the delivery\u000a      of his lecture to the October 2008 `What is British Art?' conference (`To\u000a      Each Past, Its Own\u000a      Prehistory'), he was invited to conduct an in-house seminar for Tate\u000a      Britain Adult Programming\u000a      staff on its significance for their programming. The lecture had an impact\u000a      on the institutional self-consciousness\u000a      of the programming team.\u000a    (ii) Office for Contemporary Art Norway (OCA &#8212; a foundation created by\u000a        the Norwegian Ministry of\u000a        Culture and Church Affairs and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign\u000a        Affairs), 2009-11\u000a    The research influenced the curatorial programme at OCA in 2009, through\u000a      its effect on its director\u000a      and main curator. Osborne has a history of collaboration with OCA dating\u000a      back to consultancies for\u000a      its education programming and publishing in 2006 &amp; 2007, based on\u000a      their interest in his research.\u000a      In 2009, he collaborated with its director on the exhibition, Sol\u000a        LeWitt, Sentences on Conceptual\u000a        Art: Manuscripts and Draft Materials 1968-69 (21 Oct.-19 Dec. 2009)\u000a      &#8212; visiting the collector\u000a      Herman Daled in Brussels and helping to conceptualize and to select\u000a      manuscripts for the show.\u000a      Osborne gave the public lecture on the occasion of its opening, published\u000a      as the catalogue essay.\u000a      The exhibition of these manuscript texts as works and their connection,\u000a      via the catalogue, to\u000a      German philosophical Romanticism of the late 1790s, was a practical public\u000a      enactment of\u000a      arguments from Osborne's research.\u000a    OCA is the body that commissions the Norwegian Representation at the\u000a      Venice Biennale,\u000a      historically, the world's leading regular international art exhibition. In\u000a      Sept. 2010 Osborne was\u000a      appointed by OCA to a 9-month contract as Consultant to `The\u000a      Representation of Norway at the\u000a      54th Venice Biennale. The main impact of the research in the\u000a      philosophy of art has been via this\u000a      consultancy.\u000a    (iii) Norwegian Representation at the 54th Venice Biennale,\u000a        2010-11\u000a    Norway's representation at the Venice Biennale 2011 was the first by a\u000a      participating country to\u000a      have replaced the centrality of a conventional national artistic\u000a      representation by a visual artist, or\u000a      artists, with a philosophically based talks programme, framed in terms of\u000a      the critical role played by\u000a      art within the philosophical discourse of modernity and the emphasis\u000a      within contemporary art on\u000a      the primacy of diagnoses of the historical present. Following on from his\u000a      role as a consultant for the\u000a      representation, Osborne acted as co-curator of the Norwegian programme,\u000a      defining the theme\u000a      (`The State of Things') and selecting the speakers for the public lectures\u000a      in Venice, running June-November\u000a      2011. He introduced the series at the Instituto Veneto di scienze Lettero\u000a      ed Arti, in\u000a      Venice, 1 June 2011, during the opening of the Biennale.\u000a    This curatorial decision subsequently caused considerable controversy in\u000a      Norway, regarding the\u000a      public policy on national representation and art funding (problematising\u000a      OCA's relationship with the\u000a      Ministry of Culture and the Foreign Ministry). It was the subject of a\u000a      public debate in Oslo, with the\u000a      Head of the Section of Visual Arts of the Arts Council Norway and other\u000a      senior members of the\u000a      Norwegian arts community, regarding OCA's policy, the funding of the\u000a      Norwegian Representation\u000a      and the autonomy of the foundation (20 November 2012). Its effects\u000a      continue to resonate within\u000a      public debates on cultural policy in Norway.

2, below). This critical\u000a      history has two main philosophical features: first, the claim that\u000a      conceptual art represents a\u000a      transformation in the historical ontology of the artwork; second, the\u000a      development and application of\u000a      a method for constructing such an ontology, through the treatment of the\u000a      historical field of\u000a      conceptual artworks as the product of a constellation of negations of\u000a      features hitherto considered\u000a      central to modern art.\u000a    In the second phase of the research these two ideas were explored further\u000a      with respect to: (i) the\u000a      broader relationships between `aesthetics', philosophy of art, art\u000a      criticism and the history of art\u000a      (Ref. 3.); (ii) a philosophical reconstruction of the concept of\u000a      modernism, with respect to a\u000a      generalization of the previously developed methodology of constitutive\u000a      negation (Ref. 4); and (iii)\u000a      application to contemporary art through theoretical engagement with the\u000a      works of both now-canonical\u000a      US artists of the 1960s (Sol LeWitt, Gordon Matta-Clark, Robert Smithson)\u000a      and currently\u000a      practising European and north American artists (The Atlas Group, Victor\u000a      Burgin, Elmgreen &amp;\u000a      Dragset, Tracey Emin, Gerhard Richter, Jeff Wall). This latter work was\u000a      developed in the context of\u000a      engagement with a series of major European art institutions, through\u000a      public lectures, consultancy\u000a      and the writing of catalogue essays (six of which are collected together,\u000a      in Spanish translation, in\u000a      Part IV of Ref. 5, pp. 289-412).\u000a    More recently, the work from the second phase of the research has been\u000a      brought together in a\u000a      revised form to receive a more integral and conceptually systematic\u000a      presentation (Ref. 6). This has\u000a      involved the elaboration of a further aspect to the research, which has\u000a      connected it up with\u000a      Osborne's previous research on the philosophy of time: namely, the\u000a      construction of a critical\u000a      concept of `the contemporary', understood as a category of the philosophy\u000a      of history. Research in\u000a      the philosophy of art over two decades, 1993-2012, underpinning the impact\u000a      in this cycle, has\u000a      thereby acquired a strong retrospective conceptual unity.\u000a    Peter Osborne is Professor of Modern European Philosophy and Director of\u000a      the Centre for\u000a      Research in Modern European Philosophy (CRMEP), Kingston University\u000a    The research was conducted while at Middlesex University (1993-2010) and\u000a      Kingston University\u000a      (2010-12) in the Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy\u000a      (CRMEP).

It is\u000a      widely recommended as the\u000a      key text for anyone wishing to understand the political turmoil in Haiti.\u000a      The book is credited with\u000a      changing the way journalists report on Haiti, ensuring the economic\u000a      viability of a campaigning\u000a      media organisation, and contributing to political reform in that country.\u000a    Activists and NGOs\u000a    Damming the Flood is regarded as a key resource by NGOs and activist\u000a      organisations working in\u000a      Haiti. The Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti requires that new\u000a      staff and interns read the\u000a      book in order to understand the issues central to their campaigning work,\u000a      while Partners in Health\u000a      recommends the book not only to new staff and interns (c.50% of staff have\u000a      read it) but also to the\u000a      partners they work with in Haiti [1].\u000a    The Director of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti has\u000a      said:\u000a    \"Damming the Flood is by far the most detailed and reliable\u000a      account of events leading up to\u000a      the 2004 coup in Haiti, and we continue to recommend it to researchers,\u000a      students and\u000a      journalists interested in the period... Anecdotally, many ... journalists\u000a      expressed gratitude\u000a      for having such a credible and meticulously sourced resource, and I have\u000a      seen their work\u000a      improved as a result of having studied the book.\u000a    Being able to refer people to Damming the Flood saved IJDH\u000a      significant staff time, as we\u000a      could refer people to the book rather than collecting the information\u000a      ourselves ...\u000a    It allowed newer staff members and volunteers to get up to speed quickly,\u000a      and was a handy\u000a      source for more experienced staffers to find the quote or cite they\u000a      needed. This was useful\u000a      in a range of activities, including legal filings in international courts,\u000a      asylum hearings in the\u000a      U.S., academic papers, briefing memos, book chapters, action alerts and\u000a      Congressional\u000a      briefings.\u000a    Damming the Flood was highly influential in the Haiti solidarity\u000a      community in the period\u000a      before the 2010 earthquake. We sold several boxes of the books... mostly\u000a      to activists in\u000a      North America. The book informed, influenced and inspired a whole range of\u000a      activism. It is\u000a      hard to measure this impact, but I believe the book did help hasten the\u000a      return of democracy\u000a      in Haiti.\" [2]\u000a    The Haiti Support Group and the Canada Haiti Action Network both\u000a      recommend Damming the\u000a        Flood as essential background for understanding the challenges\u000a      facing Haitian civil society today\u000a      and for contributing to the modern struggle to establish political\u000a      democracy [3]. The book has been\u000a      a hugely important resource for the Center for Economic Policy Research\u000a      from the time it was\u000a      published to the present day.\u000a    The distribution of the book to the activist community on Haiti was also\u000a      of crucial economic benefit\u000a      to Haiti Libert&#233;, the Haitian weekly campaigning newspaper,\u000a      according to one of its journalists:\u000a    \"We sold several hundred books, and those sales provided critically\u000a      needed revenue when\u000a      we were just launching both the newspaper and community center in the\u000a      second half of\u000a      2007. The sales of the book may have indeed have been the one critical\u000a      element that\u000a      assured our survival at that embryonic stage.\" [4]\u000a    Journalists\u000a    The wealth of detail and rigour of argument in Damming the Flood\u000a      made it a resource that was\u000a      prized by journalists. For example, freelance journalist Reed Lindsay has\u000a      said:\u000a    \"Of great importance, his book is the only one of its kind that refutes\u000a      the mainstream\u000a      narrative, a much-needed counterweight to Michael Deibert's Notes From\u000a        the Last\u000a        Testament. Peter's book has been an invaluable resource, and it will\u000a      continue to be so for\u000a      years to come. It is so refreshing to see such a practical and useful book\u000a      coming out of a\u000a      Philosophy department.\"\u000a    The book influenced the reporting by journalists of the political\u000a      situation is Haiti, by improving their\u000a      understanding of the context of current events. A freelance journalist who\u000a      was based in Haiti from\u000a      2010 to 2011 has said:\u000a    \"Peter's book was a central influence in our understanding of Haiti's\u000a      history and politics. I\u000a      brought Damming the Flood everywhere... I would also refer\u000a      correspondents and other\u000a      journalists who flew in for short periods to his book pointing out\u000a      chapters and sections they\u000a      should read... I was living ... with dozens of other Haitians,\u000a      journalists, activists, advocacy\u000a      and NGO types. There were many books in the house, but Damming the\u000a        Flood was the\u000a      only one we had multiple copies of. [It was]...regularly discussed and\u000a      recommended as the\u000a      definitive history of the Aristide years.\" [5]\u000a    while Daniel Lak, journalist with Al Jazeera, has stated that:\u000a    \"I found the book immensely helpful in provoking thoughts and curiosity\u000a      about how\u000a      international players (Canada, France and especially the U.S.) were\u000a      involved in the\u000a      downfall of JB Aristide and Famni Lavalas.\"\u000a    Despite activist organisations having put out some similar information\u000a      previously, journalists\u000a      regarded Damming the Flood as the only publication to have told\u000a      this story. In the assessment of\u000a      the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, this illustrates the\u000a      reluctance that journalists often\u000a      have in accepting narratives that go against mainstream official sources,\u000a      and the key role that a\u000a      rigorous academic work can play in changing how the media reports complex\u000a      and controversial\u000a      stories.

For most of the\u000a      twentieth century,\u000a      Haiti was governed by dictatorships that were more less directly\u000a      controlled by the USA, but in the\u000a      late 1980s a popular mobilization known as Lavalas, or `the\u000a      flood', sought to liberate the island\u000a      from dictatorial rule. In 1990, Lavalas leader Jean-Bertrand Aristide\u000a      became president after a\u000a      landslide election victory. Nine months later the Haitian army, with US\u000a      support, overthrew the\u000a      government. Subsequently, Aristide was obliged, as a condition for a\u000a      return to democracy in 1994,\u000a      to accept neoliberal economic policies that undercut Haiti's agrarian\u000a      economy, weakened its\u000a      government, privatised its remaining public assets and rendered millions\u000a      of its people destitute.\u000a    Hallward's research attempts to explain why and how Aristide's opponents\u000a      in Haiti, the US, France\u000a      and Canada ensured that his second government, elected with another\u000a      overwhelming majority in\u000a      2000, was toppled by a further coup in 2004.\u000a    The goal of the research was to clarify the nature of the anti-Lavalas\u000a      campaign, to articulate the\u000a      international and national political interests behind it, and to draw\u000a      connections to ongoing political\u000a      struggles in Latin America and the rest of the postcolonial world. An\u000a      analysis of Haiti's\u000a      contemporary predicament, Hallward argues, should be based on an\u000a      understanding of this long\u000a      campaign to thwart its partial transition to democracy. The impotence of\u000a      the Haitian government\u000a      was exposed, at tremendous cost, in the wake of the disastrous January\u000a      2010 earthquake, which\u000a      destroyed much of Port-au-Prince. Haiti's dramatic dependence on\u000a      foreign-provided reconstruction\u000a      funds has reduced it, further, to the status of a neocolonial\u000a      protectorate.\u000a    The research involved scores of interviews with current and recent\u000a      politicians, cabinet ministers\u000a      (including the former president and former prime minister), mayors,\u000a      officials, journalists, and\u000a      political activists in Haiti. In 2006-07 Hallward worked with journalists\u000a      from Haiti Progr&#232;s, Radio\u000a        Solidarit&#233;, Haiti en Marche, Radio M&#233;lodie, and SOS\u000a        Journalistes.\u000a    The main research underpinning the impact is historical and empirical\u000a      research into Haitian and\u000a      international politics. However, it is connected to the construction of\u000a      political arguments that have a\u000a      broader intellectual basis in Hallward's work in political philosophy, and\u000a      their context in the mission\u000a      and research of the submitting unit. The Centre for Research in Modern\u000a      European Philosophy\u000a      (CRMEP) is dedicated to research in European philosophy `characterised by\u000a      a strong emphasis on\u000a      broad cultural and intellectual contexts and a distinctive sense of social\u000a      and political engagement'.\u000a      Hallward's research on Haiti is the `applied' side of his main ongoing\u000a      research project on the\u000a      concepts of `political will' and `the people' in European philosophy since\u000a      the 18th century. (A\u000a      preliminary outcome is his Output 3, in section 3 below.) That research is\u000a      grounded in a study of\u000a      Rousseau's political philosophy (forthcoming as the book Rousseau and\u000a        Political Will, Verso,\u000a      2014), which grounds the notion of democratic self-determination and the\u000a      conceptual opposition\u000a      `will\/containment' that structures the empirical research.\u000a    The research was undertaken while Hallward was Professor of Modern\u000a      European Philosophy in\u000a      the CRMEP at Middlesex University, 2005-10 and at Kingston 2010&#8212;11. (HECFE\u000a      have recognised\u000a      this period at Middlesex as `transferable' to Kingston for the purposes of\u000a      REF impact, as a result of\u000a      the transfer of the CRMEP from Middlesex to Kingston in July 2010.)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41288","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"6254930","Name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Professor Rai Gaita is one of Australia's foremost public intellectuals.\u000a      The connection between his philosophical research and his more\u000a      general-public works was captured in the citation for the award of the\u000a      degree of Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of Antwerp, 2009: `for\u000a      his exceptional contribution to contemporary moral philosophy and for his\u000a      singular contribution to the role of the intellectual in today's academic\u000a      world'. In 2011, Flinders University organised a conference in his honour;\u000a      speakers included writers, filmmakers, lawyers, social workers, political\u000a      and literary theorists and poets. In recognition of the cultural\u000a      importance of his work, the National Library of Australia has asked for\u000a      Gaita's papers for their collection, and the Australian National Portrait\u000a      Gallery commissioned his portrait in 2012. (There is also a street\u000a      graffiti portrait of Gaita in Melbourne). His work has influenced public\u000a      attitudes towards justice (to humans and animals), multiculturalism, war\u000a      and reconciliation, collective responsibility, racism, genocide and crimes\u000a      against humanity, and also the general public's understanding of the\u000a      experiences of immigrants in Australia. The following are examples of\u000a      these impacts on different groups of beneficiaries.\u000a    The General Public. Described by Nobel Laureate J.M. Coetzee as\u000a      `one of those miraculous books ... that have an unpredictable life of\u000a      their own', Gaita's book Romulus, My Father has sold more than\u000a      100,000 copies in English and is one `of Australia's best loved books' (The\u000a        Australian, 19.8.2011). The film adaption reached even more people:\u000a      it was seen by approximately 10% of Australians (i.e., over 2m) on its\u000a      release, and it continues to be viewed throughout the world in cinemas &#8212;\u000a      now primarily at festivals and in art houses, on television and on DVD\u000a      (the latter has sold about 30,000 copies). Both book and film have made\u000a      people re-examine how they live their lives and have inspired them to\u000a      re-evaluate their choices. These are just two examples among many of\u000a      testimonies by email correspondence since 2008:\u000a    `I just saw the film Romulus, My Father with a friend, and we both\u000a      enjoyed it tremendously. I feel honoured to be writing you... You are an\u000a      inspiration. Your work is certain to get people talking ... and ultimately\u000a      will help many people overcome burdens in their own lives.'\u000a    `In seeing the movie and reading your book several times I sense the\u000a      sadness, despair, sympathy, love, hope and heartbreak of young Rai. The\u000a      things that you wrote about your mother were very personal and must have\u000a      been difficult to open to public scrutiny (...) Here I am, a person who\u000a      was born forty years and half a world away from Christina who thanks to\u000a      her son and his love and sympathy for her I recognised and admitted to\u000a      myself what I've been suffering for so long. And for this I thank you\u000a      Professor Gaita.'\u000a    The book has a significant profile in the Australian Education System and\u000a      is currently on the reading list for the Higher School Certificate in New\u000a      South Wales and Victoria. The text is required to help children reflect on\u000a      the cultural diversity of their community and to encourage affirming\u000a      perspectives. To date it has been selected for assessment by over 10,000\u000a      children in Victoria. The use of the book in schools has ensured `that the\u000a      ethical and philosophical questions posed by Professor Gaita's story are\u000a      considered by a broad cross section of our community, not just those\u000a      undertaking a formal study of philosophy' (Vice-Chancellor, University of\u000a      Melbourne. Letter, March, 2013).\u000a    Since 2009, Gaita has spoken every year to large groups of schoolchildren\u000a      (up to 700) for whom Romulus is a set text. The Director of Information\u000a      Access gives a telling description of the impact of these talks on\u000a      children:\u000a    `Having last left off reading the years of Raimond as a child, they\u000a      experience standing before them now someone who not only survived the\u000a      experiences but who offers philosophical pathways to integrate challenging\u000a      human experience' (Email correspondence, 2013).\u000a    The film Romulus, My Father was the most successful of all Australian\u000a      releases in 2007, earning ca. $2.6 million and won the 2007 Australian\u000a      Film Institute (AFI) award. Since then, it has not only reached the\u000a      general public, but it also influenced Australia's cultural and creative\u000a      landscape. In the words of its producer: 'The cinema, DVD, and television\u000a      release of ROMULUS reached an estimated audience of 2.5 million\u000a      Australians... The film also had a huge global reach, premiering at the\u000a      prestigious Toronto International Film Festival and selling in many\u000a      territories throughout the world.... There is a significant cultural\u000a      impact and importance in telling Australian stories like this on the\u000a      global scale achieved by ROMULUS, MY FATHER....We worked with the\u000a      Australian Teachers of Media (ATOM) to develop a study guide and support\u000a      screenings in schools. [...] The film and associated props and screenplays\u000a      [have formed an important part of Australia's cultural heritage and] are\u000a      held in the collection of the National Film and Sound Archive in Canberra.\u000a      ... [The] wonderful book ROMULUS, MY FATHER brought together a group of\u000a      filmmakers to create a film that has had a huge reach, ... prompting many\u000a      and varied discussions and articles about its themes and the important\u000a      ideas it explores.' (Email correspondence 2013).\u000a    Policymakers. Gaita's work on human rights and international\u000a      justice has had international reach and a profound effect on the\u000a      understanding of nationalism and international politics. These examples,\u000a      selected among others, serve to illustrate the claim:\u000a    - Gaita was invited to speak at a major international policy event\u000a      sponsored by the Austrian foreign ministry, `Trilogue. Global Visions: are\u000a      we Speaking a Common Language?' in Salzburg 2008. Participants included\u000a      the Rt. Hon. Kim Campbell (former Prime Minister of Canada), Peter\u000a      Sutherland (chairman of BP) and Michael Fleischhacker (chief editor of Die\u000a        Presse). His letter of invitation recognised the impact of his work\u000a      on debates about nationalism and international politics.\u000a    - In November 2010, Gaita was invited to discuss the morality of the\u000a      Israeli-Palestinian conflict with three eminent military figures: Colonel\u000a      Richard Kemp, Major General Yaakov Amidror and Major General Jim Molan.\u000a      Organized by NSW Jewish National Fund, it attracted over 900 guests,\u000a      including influential members of the Australian Jewish community. His\u000a      contribution caused a significant stir, prompting a debate with the head\u000a      of the NSWJNF, reported in the local press.\u000a    - In 2012 the International Melbourne Writers Festival invited him to\u000a      discuss the prospects for peace in the Middle East with Martyn Indyk,\u000a      former US Ambassador to Israel under President Clinton and presently\u000a      President Obama's envoy to negotiations between Israel and Palestine.\u000a    - Gaita's work is often used by public figures and policymakers, for\u000a      example in former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams' book Faith\u000a        in the Public Square (2012, p. 17), to deepen their understanding of\u000a      contemporary issues, as attested by the Vice Chancellor of Melbourne\u000a      University:\u000a    `Professor Gaita is a public intellectual of considerable standing. He\u000a      has demonstrated an ability to engage the higher education sector and the\u000a      broader community in considered mediation, constantly challenging ideas\u000a      and proposing new thought. (...) In 2011 and 2012 Professor Gaita\u000a      organized the Wednesday lectures series here at Melbourne University. They\u000a      are a highly popular part of our calendar of events and are well attended\u000a      by students, staff and the general public. (...) the lectures are much\u000a      anticipated by colleagues for their thought-provoking discussion and\u000a      ideas.' (Vice Chancellor of Melbourne University, The `Wednesday lecture\u000a      series' are open to the public and regularly draw audiences of c.200-300\u000a      people. Email correspondence, 2013).\u000a    In 2008 Gaita was invited to speak to senior leaders and new graduates at\u000a      the Australian Government's Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Its\u000a      secretary, Andrew Metcalfe AO, described the expected impact of that talk\u000a      as helping `to develop and strengthen the leadership group's appreciation\u000a      of its central role in promoting good governance throughout the\u000a      organization'.\u000a    The Legal Profession. Gaita regularly gives seminars and lectures\u000a      to both academic and practicing lawyers. In 2010 he spoke to the Victorian\u000a      Association of Magistrates on the subject of `Morality, Moralizing and the\u000a      Law'. The c.200 audience included senior members of the Victorian legal\u000a      establishment. Gaita's absolute conception of human value has influenced\u000a      the thinking of lawyers, especially on justice and human rights. For\u000a      example, Julian Burnside, one of Australia's most prominent human rights\u000a      lawyers, writes: `Rai Gaita's work had a powerful impact on me. My\u000a      involvement in human rights work was increasing significantly, and his\u000a      book [3.3] helped shape my response to a number of human rights problems.\u000a      The... book was profoundly important in helping me think about social\u000a      justice and human rights' (email correspondence, 2013).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Rai Gaita's work brings a distinctive conception of good and evil to bear\u000a      on a range of central and abiding moral questions. His work has shaped and\u000a      changed the understanding of core moral and political issues by the\u000a      general public in Australia and in other countries, and it has influenced\u000a      the attitudes of policy makers and lawyers. Some of his books are on the\u000a      reading list for the Higher School Certificate in Australia and have\u000a      therefore had an immediate impact on the moral sensitivities of young\u000a      Australians.\u000a    Not many contemporary moral philosophers have had such impact beyond the\u000a      academic sphere. Why and how has Gaita achieved this impact? While\u000a      academic philosophers tend to present their ideas in more technical form,\u000a      Gaita's work crosses the boundaries between philosophical inquiry and\u000a      literature. He brings philosophical issues to life by using the narrative\u000a      form. For instance, his book Romulus, My Father, which uses\u000a      biography to meditate on the human condition, has reached and influenced\u000a      vast numbers of people. It was adapted into a film of the same title\u000a      internationally released in 2007 and 2008. The inextricable connection\u000a      between form and content in Gaita's work enables non-philosophical\u000a      audiences to engage with, and respond to, his moral philosophy. In\u000a      addition, his work has made a substantial contribution to the publishing\u000a      and creative industries through the outstanding success of his books and\u000a      related outputs.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    King's College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"King's College London","InstitutionName":"King's College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003645}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2803138","Name":"Antwerpen"},{"GeoNamesId":"2158177","Name":"Melbourne"},{"GeoNamesId":"2766824","Name":"Salzburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2172517","Name":"Canberra"},{"GeoNamesId":"2803138","Name":"Antwerp"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1.

From 1999 to his retirement in\u000a      2010 he was Professor of Moral Philosophy at King's, where he is now\u000a      emeritus professor. From 2000 to 2011 he was also Foundation Professor of\u000a      Philosophy at the Australian Catholic University. In 2002 he was elected a\u000a      Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities.\u000a    Gaita was a central member of the philosophy department at King's who\u000a      attracted many graduate students (22 in the period). He published research\u000a      papers in a number of international journals (Philosophical Quarterly,\u000a      Inquiry, Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society) as well\u000a      as several monographs. In 2011 Routledge published a festschrift: `Philosophy,\u000a        Ethics and a Common Humanity: Essays in Honour of Raimond Gaita',\u000a      edited by Christopher Cordner.\u000a    His first book, Good and Evil: An Absolute Conception (3.1)\u000a      developed a conception of absolute value based on the Socratic affirmation\u000a      that it is better to suffer evil than to do it. It elaborates an\u000a      integrative conception of value that takes goodness to be fully revealed\u000a      in the works of saintly love, characterises evil as an assault on what he\u000a      calls `the inalienably preciousness' of every human being, and offers an\u000a      original account of the importance of remorse as distinct from shame.\u000a      Alasdair Macintyre called it `an outstanding contribution to moral\u000a      philosophy'. A Common Humanity: Thinking about Love and Truth and\u000a        Justice (3.3) explores the implications of this conception of good\u000a      and evil for understanding the complex relations between morality, law and\u000a      politics. Based on these two research monographs are two philosophical\u000a      memoirs.\u000a    The first, Romulus, My Father (3.2) tells the story of Gaita's\u000a      father and reflects philosophically on it. It was made into a film,\u000a      released in 2007-08. The second, The Philosopher's Dog (3.4),\u000a      explores the nature of goodness and character, the role of political\u000a      ideals, and our relationship with and treatment of animals.\u000a    Both books are, to use Roger Scruton's term (The Telegraph, 2003),\u000a      experiments in narrative philosophy. Gaita's use of the genre of\u000a      philosophical memoir is fuelled by his philosophical investigation into\u000a      the nature of philosophy. In a suggestive paper he argued that philosophy\u000a      is a discursive discipline, but that the discourse is not restricted to\u000a      `the kind of thought in which form and content are separable' (3.5, 277.)\u000a      Hence, in his work `there will be no marked distinction between the\u000a      narratives that must to some degree nourish inquiry and philosophical\u000a      engagement with them' (Ibid.). Gaita's books implement this view: they are\u000a      philosophical inquiries in which form and content are inseparable. Thus\u000a      Gaita's narrative philosophy opens up philosophy for the non-academic\u000a      public.\u000a    Since 2008 Gaita has elaborated upon these themes in his collection After\u000a        Romulus (3.6). And more recently he has explored the consequences of\u000a      an inclusive understanding of humanity and human values for\u000a      multiculturalism in his book Essays on Muslims and Multiculturalism\u000a      (3.7), nominated for the 2012 Inaugural Award of the International Center\u000a      for Muslim and Non-Muslim Understanding, University of South Australia,\u000a      for `Promotion of Understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims'.\u000a    Because of their accessibility to the general public, those last four\u000a      books, the film, and Gaita's numerous media contributions and public\u000a      engagements (e.g. over 20 lectures internationally in the period) have\u000a      been the main pathways for his philosophical work on morality and humanity\u000a      to achieve its extraordinary impact beyond academic circles, as documented\u000a      below.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41289","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The podcast project has benefited thousands of users internationally,\u000a      inspiring them, enriching\u000a      their lives and informing and influencing their intellectual, cultural and\u000a      personal development. This\u000a      has been made possible by the way in which the project makes high-level\u000a      research physically and\u000a      intellectually accessible. The format of the podcast series makes it\u000a      possible to convey advanced\u000a      and detailed philosophical research findings to a broad audience.\u000a      Moreover, the podcasts are\u000a      easily and freely available, as they can be downloaded from an RSS feed\u000a      (via software such as\u000a      iTunes). This has ensured that the podcasts have reached a broad audience,\u000a      both in academic\u000a      and non-academic settings. The total number of downloads as of\u000a      July 31, 2013 was over 4\u000a        million for 139 episodes &#8212; an average of almost 30,000 downloads per\u000a      episode. Within 1-2\u000a      weeks, an episode will typically be downloaded about 7,000 times. The\u000a      podcast homepage has\u000a      been viewed just under 600,000 times. Total views for each episode are\u000a      available amongst the\u000a      sources in 5 below, but here is a sample of relevant statistics: the first\u000a      episode has been viewed on\u000a      the website about 38,000 times, an early interview with MM McCabe on\u000a      Heraclitus 10,000 times, a\u000a      more recent episode on al-Kindi about 3,000 times. This indicates how many\u000a      times people have\u000a      listened to episodes streaming directly off the website, as opposed to\u000a      downloading them.\u000a    In light of these statistics it is clear that the podcasts have thousands\u000a      of regular listeners. This\u000a      impression is confirmed by the facebook fan page of the podcasts, which\u000a      has over 4000 fans; and\u000a      the Twitter account (@HistPhilosophy) maintained by Prof. Adamson which\u000a      has about 2600\u000a      followers. Both the facebook page and Twitter account are used to\u000a      publicize new episodes, to\u000a      interact with listeners and answer questions, and to disseminate related\u000a      information such as\u000a      philosophy events in London and beyond.\u000a    Because podcasts can be accessed globally, listeners have written from\u000a      far-flung places like\u000a      Australia, Canada, Mexico, Norway and Russia. Two listeners got in touch\u000a      from Brazil and Korea\u000a      to ask about translating the podcasts into Portuguese and Korean. Many\u000a      listeners indicate that\u000a      they are not academics &#8212; for instance one listener said that they enjoyed\u000a      listening while driving\u000a      their UPS truck, another wrote to say that they are writing a blog about\u000a      their attempts to replicate\u000a      the educational experience of a BA using only freely available internet\u000a      resources, and that with the\u000a      help of this podcast they are `majoring in philosophy.'\u000a    The impact of the podcasts is also shown by hundreds of comments on\u000a      iTunes, the podcasts\u000a      website, facebook page, and direct emails to Prof. Adamson. These\u000a      illustrate the fact that the\u000a      podcasts produce great excitement and inspiration in regular listeners of\u000a      all ages and\u000a      backgrounds, and have been taken up in formal education from secondary to\u000a      university graduate\u000a      levels.

Until very recently I was a stranger to\u000a      philosophy, but since\u000a      taking a course on Roman history at university I've began to open the door\u000a      to its vaulted treasures.\u000a      It feels like I'm still only peeking through a crack in the door &#8212; much of\u000a      the information in your\u000a      podcast is entirely new to me &#8212; yet the position I'm in is a deeply\u000a      exciting one.'\u000a    `I am thoroughly enjoying the podcasts. At age 72 I have `suddenly'\u000a      discovered Philosophy and am\u000a      quite taken by Aristotle and St Thomas Aquinas.

I have always enjoyed philosophy though, and the\u000a      podcast has been both\u000a      a delight and a way to make up for lost time! Keep up the excellent work!'\u000a    `I have been listening intently. I use it as I drive to and from work\u000a      where I take 000 calls.

I'm a mailman, not a scholar... Will be listening to the\u000a      entire library.'\u000a    `I'm 19 years old and have recently developed a passing interest in\u000a      philosophy. Before I go ahead\u000a      and start to learn on a more in-depth level about particular philosophers,\u000a      I'm trying to develop a\u000a      good core knowledge of the whole subject. That way, I can choose which\u000a      aspects appeal to me the\u000a      most and find some more specialised material on them. Your podcast series\u000a      is a brilliant starting\u000a      point for me, since you talk in a way that even somebody, like me, who is\u000a      not a student in the\u000a      subject can understand. You don't assume that the person listening to the\u000a      podcast is already\u000a      educated in philosophy like some of the other resources that I have found\u000a      do.'\u000a    `I thought you might like to know that alongside Nigel Warburton's\u000a      Philosophy Bites your podcasts\u000a      are also becoming part of my A-Level teaching and that my students are\u000a      making use of them to get\u000a      insights and opinions I have not offered. I merely provide a sheet of\u000a      timed questions and some\u000a      headphones and set them off.

For\u000a      instance, in episode 6,\u000a      Prof. McCabe discusses her influential view that Heraclitus' fragments\u000a      need to be read as an\u000a      invitation to a kind of `dialogue' with the reader; in episode 50, three\u000a      current King's ancient\u000a      philosophers discuss work they have done on Aristotle's reaction to Plato;\u000a      in episodes 17 and 72,\u000a      Dr. Woolf draws on his published studies of Socrates and Cicero.\u000a      Similarly, the podcasts have\u000a      allowed Prof. Adamson to give other scholars from outside King's a chance\u000a      to disseminate the\u000a      fruits of their research. Interviews on ancient philosophy have featured\u000a      Malcolm Schofield, David\u000a      Sedley, George Boys-Stones, Serafina Cuomo, R.J. Hankinson, and numerous\u000a      others.\u000a    Prof. Adamson's own research became especially important for the podcasts\u000a      starting with\u000a      episodes which aired in spring of 2013, when he reached philosophy in the\u000a      Islamic world. A major\u000a      goal of the podcasts is to disseminate Prof. Adamson's work on philosophy\u000a      in the late ancient and\u000a      Islamic traditions, by first building an audience through episodes on\u000a      classical philosophy, and then\u000a      covering late antiquity and the Islamic world in considerable detail. To\u000a      give just one example, Prof.\u000a      Adamson is the author of a monograph on al-Kindi, the first Muslim\u000a      philosopher, and the podcasts\u000a      will give him an opportunity to disseminate this research to a wide\u000a      audience. The same point goes\u000a      for Plotinus, Avicenna, Averroes and other philosophers dealt with in\u000a      Prof. Adamson's publications.\u000a      Some indication of the tight relationship between his research and the\u000a      podcasts is the `further\u000a      reading' recommended on the podcasts' website, which indicates primary and\u000a      secondary literature\u000a      for listeners to pursue further, and on which the episodes were based. As\u000a      of episode 120, the\u000a      further reading nearly always includes one or more of Adamson's\u000a      publications, the relevant\u000a      episodes being partly or wholly concise presentations of these\u000a      publications.\u000a      Prof. Adamson is Professor of Ancient and Medieval Philosophy at King's,\u000a      and Professor of Late\u000a      Antique and Arabic Philosophy at the LMU in Munich. He began at King's in\u000a      2000.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41290","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The commentaries on Aristotle constitute approximately half of the total\u000a      ancient philosophical\u000a      corpus, but before this Project they were barely recognized as part of\u000a      that corpus by most scholars\u000a      in the field, let alone the broader public interested in philosophy. Now\u000a      discussion of Aristotle is\u000a      routinely informed by interpretations found in the commentators, and the\u000a      study of the\u000a      commentators has been integrated into the study and teaching of late\u000a      antiquity as a whole.\u000a    The project has transformed our understanding of the development of the\u000a      Western intellectual\u000a      tradition through the medieval period and beyond. Philoponus and others\u000a      commentators were\u000a      translated into Arabic, and Porphyry and Boethius wrote commentaries that\u000a      were hugely influential\u000a      in Latin medieval thought. The background of Christian-pagan philosophical\u000a      controversy can now\u000a      be better appreciated, and medieval discussions of topics ranging from\u000a      logical theory to theories of\u000a      intellect or the eternity of the universe have been brought into focus.\u000a    To take just one example, the eternity of the universe, the Project has\u000a      given us English versions of\u000a      Philoponus' critique of Aristotle's arguments for eternity, the responses\u000a      to this critique by the\u000a      Platonist Simplicius, a further massive work by Philoponus refuting\u000a      Proclus on the same topic, and\u000a      most recently a pair of texts by Christian authors anticipating arguments\u000a      later given by Philoponus.\u000a    This has brought out the philosophical connections between cosmology and\u000a      theology and revealed\u000a      a subtle cultural debate between pagan and Christian intellectuals that\u000a      lasted over centuries. Thus\u000a      in the Islamic world Philoponus was gratefully used to stop the\u000a      Aristotelian endorsement of the\u000a      eternity of the universe's limiting God's creative powers, while figures\u000a      like Avicenna and Duns\u000a      Scotus made advances in modal logic designed to reconfigure the whole\u000a      debate by severing the\u000a      link between necessity and eternity.\u000a    The translations have also reached Islamicists, theologians, historians\u000a      of philosophy, historians of\u000a      ancient Greece and Byzantium, Medieval and Renaissance scholars, Latinists\u000a      and Hellenists,\u000a      historians of science and society, scholars of ancient education,\u000a      literature and lexicography, and\u000a      scholars working in many other areas where light is cast by the ancient\u000a      commentators. What was\u000a      once largely inaccessible is now easily available. As Myles Burnyeat has\u000a      written, as a result of the\u000a      project, '[t]he Greek commentators are now being read around the world\u000a      with an intensity of\u000a      interest they have not received since they were first written' (Myles\u000a      Burnyeat, Classical Association\u000a        News). The enormous scale of the scholarly task involved has also\u000a      made it into the popular\u000a      consciousness, with Harry Mount describing the project in a Daily\u000a      Telegraph blog as `the most\u000a      extraordinary feat of British scholarship ever'.\u000a    The most easily documentable impact of the Project has been in\u000a      educational contexts. Broadly\u000a      speaking, the project has affected the teaching of ancient philosophy in\u000a      two ways. First, it has\u000a      altered the teaching of Aristotle himself. By looking at ancient\u000a      commentators, we are far better\u000a      placed to understand his thought. A good example is his philosophy of\u000a      mind. Thus, on the\u000a      mysterious `maker intellect' of On the Soul 3.5, or on whether the\u000a      human soul can survive without a\u000a      body, the commentators offer extensive exegetical discussion where\u000a      Aristotle provides only\u000a      tantalizing suggestions. Indeed the commentaries are models of exegesis:\u000a      every word is given\u000a      careful consideration, contextualized within the purposes of the work as a\u000a      whole, and\u000a      interpretations are checked for philosophical plausibility and\u000a      compatibility with the source author's\u000a      other commitments. In this sense the project offers a unique opportunity\u000a      to teach the art of\u000a      exegesis while also teaching students about a previously unexplored part\u000a      of the history of\u000a      philosophy.\u000a    Second, the commentators can be taught as a subject in their own right.\u000a      The commentaries are full\u000a      of novel philosophical insights, and colleagues around the world have used\u000a      the volumes to bring\u000a      this material to their students. The late antique commentators provide a\u000a      unique perspective on\u000a      ancient philosophy. For example, one of the Project's volumes contains the\u000a      commentaries of\u000a      Ammonius and Boethius on On Interpretation 9, allowing students to\u000a      see how the ancients\u000a      understood Aristotle's response to the famous sea-battle argument.\u000a      Furthermore, the volumes\u000a      include some of the most important sources for Presocratic and Hellenistic\u000a      thought (especially\u000a      Simplicius). Thus for the first time it is possible for the Greek-less\u000a      reader to see the context in\u000a      which these earlier authors are quoted, rather than simply reading English\u000a      versions of those\u000a      fragments. This allows students to see figures like Parmenides,\u000a      Empedocles, or Chrysippus as\u000a      existing outside a body of static doctrine put forward by a handful of\u000a      great thinkers (Socrates, Plato\u000a      and Aristotle) and as participants in an active living debate, much like\u000a      philosophy today.\u000a    Courses that in the last five years have used editions from the\u000a      Commentators' project or Sorabji's\u000a      three-volume sourcebook include (HEI followed by course level and title):\u000a      Birkbeck College,\u000a      London, undergraduate course `Further History of Philosophy'; Leiden\u000a      University, the Netherlands,\u000a      MA seminars on `Images of Stoic Thought', `Ethics, Psychology and\u000a      Education in Ancient and\u000a      Medieval Philosophy', `Science and Philosophy in Ancient Curriculum' and\u000a      `Memory and\u000a      Imagination in Ancient and Medieval Philosophy'; Princeton University,\u000a      USA, graduate seminar on\u000a      `the Presocratics'; University of Cologne, Germany,\u000a      undergraduate\/postgraduate seminar\u000a      `Forschungskolloquium Antike und Sp&#228;tantike Philosophie'; LMU, Munich,\u000a      Germany, graduate\u000a      seminars on Aristotle's Metaphysics (using esp. Alexander and\u000a      Syrianus); Emory University, USA,\u000a      graduate teaching used in seminars (using esp. Alexander of Aphrodisias,\u000a      Simplicius and Proclus'\u000a      De Malorum Subsistentia); University of Rome, Italy, undergraduate\u000a      course on `Aristotle's\u000a      Categories' and MA course on Plotinus; Universidad Panamericana,\u000a      Mexico, graduate seminars on\u000a      the `Commentaries on Physics and Metaphysics'; University\u000a      of Paris-Diderot, France, graduate\u000a      seminars on `Physical Transmission', `On Philoponus' Natural Philosophy',\u000a      and on `Averroes'\u000a      Commentary on the De caelo'; University of Freiburg, Germany,\u000a      undergraduate and postgraduate\u000a      seminars `On the Categories'; Marquette University, USA, graduate course\u000a      `The Neoplatonic\u000a      Reading of Aristotle'.\u000a    The Project has meant that the philosophy and ideas revealed by the\u000a      commentators can readily be\u000a      taught in undergraduate courses, Masters programmes and doctoral seminars.\u000a      Nor is it only the\u000a      Greek-less student who benefits from the commentaries. Even students with\u000a      Greek acknowledge\u000a      the importance of good editions of translations, particularly of such\u000a      difficult and often technical\u000a      texts. Thus one teacher says that `The (...) volumes dedicated to\u000a      Simplicius' commentary on De\u000a        caelo are of great help, because of their textual emendations,\u000a      because they offer a translation (and\u000a      a translation is always welcome even for those who know Greek) and because\u000a      of their illuminating\u000a      introductions and annotations' (Ahmad Hasnaoui, University of\u000a      Paris-Diderot, France). Similarly,\u000a      New York University classicist David Konstan says: `I can and do freely\u000a      refer students to the\u000a      commentators, now that most of the significant material has been\u000a      translated. The impact of the\u000a      project has been enormous' (David Konstan, Classics, NYU, USA).\u000a    Because of English's status as an academic lingua franca, classes and\u000a      seminars across the world\u000a      have been reshaped and restructured to allow students to learn from the\u000a      commentators. `It has\u000a      made it vastly easier to include these materials in syllabi. I was able to\u000a      structure a whole\u000a      semester's graduate class on the commentator's responses to Aristotle'\u000a      (Owen Goldin, Marquette\u000a      University, USA). `The Duckworth translations are (...) constantly\u000a      referred to in my classes (...), by\u000a      students (both undergrad and grad) in their reports, in their MA and PhD\u000a      theses, etc.' (Amos\u000a      Bertolacci, Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy). A recent (Sept. 2012)\u000a      job advert for teaching in\u000a      Ancient Philosophy at the University of Freiburg included `extensive\u000a      expertise in the Greek\u000a      Commentators' as an asset (http:\/\/philjobs.org\/job\/show\/1222).\u000a      This was unheard of before the\u000a      project.\u000a    Apart from their influence on the teaching of western Philosophy, the\u000a      texts are also being used to\u000a      teach Arabic Philosophy, in virtue of their major influence on this\u000a      tradition. For instance, at McGill\u000a      University, Canada, graduate seminars using the texts are offered on\u000a      Arabic Philosophy, `Modal\u000a      syllogistic', `Philosophy of language and 02bfilm al-wa1e0d02bf'\u000a      and `Dialectic and &#257;d&#257;b al-ba1e25th'. At Yale\u000a      University, USA, graduate seminars using the editions are offered in both\u000a      Arabic Philosophy and\u000a      Avicenna. As Yale's Dimitri Gutas states, the commentators' project\u000a      `revolutionized the study of\u000a      ancient philosophy and made the life of us Arabic philosophy specialists\u000a      so much easier: in the\u000a      past, I could hardly recommend to my students in Arabic philosophy to read\u000a      any commentary in the\u000a      Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca. (...) Now all I have to do&#8212;and I\u000a      do it as a matter of fact for\u000a      my Philosophy and especially Avicenna seminars&#8212;is list the commentaries\u000a      (...) that students\u000a      should read, and it's done'. Overall, the educational significance of this\u000a      project for understanding\u000a      Arabic Philosophy has been profound. Indeed, according to A. Hasnaoui, the\u000a      Commentators\u000a      Project has been '[w]ithout any doubt the most important event of recent\u000a      decades in the study of\u000a      Arabic philosophy', (A. Hasnaoui, Arabic Sciences and Philosophy).\u000a      The Commentators are also\u000a      opening up teaching possibilities in the area of Jewish thought, with\u000a      Bar-Ilan University, Israel,\u000a      offering a new graduate seminar on Gersonides' commentaries on Averroes'\u000a      commentaries on\u000a      Aristotle, which uses translations of Philoponus and Simplicius from the\u000a      series.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study concerns the impact of a major translation and publishing\u000a      project unique in its\u000a      scale and ambition. The surviving ancient Greek commentaries on Aristotle\u000a      were published in a\u000a      series titled Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca (ed. Diels,\u000a      1882-1909). This made the texts\u000a      available to readers of ancient Greek, but their length and technical\u000a      nature meant that even\u000a      classically trained scholars made rather sparing use of the commentaries.\u000a      The Ancient\u000a      Commentators Project was initiated in 1987 in order to translate these\u000a      texts into English. The\u000a      project has now succeeded beyond all original expectations. The 100th\u000a      volume was published in\u000a      December 2012, and nearly the entire corpus of late antique commentaries\u000a      is now available in\u000a      English.\u000a    By making the commentaries accessible to a vastly increased audience, the\u000a      project has made a\u000a      contribution to the preservation and presentation of our cultural\u000a      heritage. This impact has been felt\u000a      especially in the field of education: the availability of these primary\u000a      sources has influenced deeply\u000a      and widely the design and delivery of curricula of ancient and medieval\u000a      philosophy at HEIs\u000a      internationally.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    King's College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"King's College London","InstitutionName":"King's College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003645}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    3.1 Commentators Volumes (104 vols.) include: Philoponus (30\u000a      vols.); Alexander (19 vols.);\u000a      Simplicius (29 vols.)

Its aim was to translate the principal Greek commentaries on\u000a      Aristotle into English for the\u000a      first time (along with a number of related philosophical texts from late\u000a      antiquity, sometimes from\u000a      languages other than Greek) and publish them, accompanied by an\u000a      explanatory introduction and\u000a      notes.\u000a    To date, over 100 volumes have been published with a further 20 assigned\u000a      or under consideration.\u000a      86 of the 104 volumes appeared between 1993 and 2013. The next volumes\u000a      will expand coverage\u000a      even further. They will translate the remaining commentaries on Aristotle\u000a      from Diels' original series\u000a      in Greek, and will add translations of some newly discovered Greek\u000a      fragments and of Syriac,\u000a      Hebrew and Arabic texts of commentaries whose Greek versions have been\u000a      lost.\u000a    A number of ancillary publications have emerged from the Project: several\u000a      collections of papers on\u000a      the commentators, including Aristotle Transformed and a two-volume\u000a      collection on the\u000a      commentators which appeared with the Institute of Classical Studies in\u000a      2004. Particularly important\u000a      for the project's impact has been the publication of Prof. Sorabji's\u000a      three-volume sourcebook on the\u000a      commentators (2004). These textbooks, together with the translations, have\u000a      made it possible for\u000a      the first time to teach this rich and important material in an accessible\u000a      manner.\u000a    As well as through publication of the volumes and other texts, the\u000a      project's findings have been\u000a      disseminated through Prof. Sorabji's numerous talks and media\u000a      participation (print, TV, radio and\u000a      online). The publication of the 100th volume was marked with a\u000a      four-day international conference in\u000a      December 2012, in London (Institute of Philosophy and King's) and Oxford\u000a      (Wolfson College).\u000a    The first 100 volumes were digitalized by December 2012, and paperback\u000a      editions have been\u000a      added at less than half the price of the hardback. This has increased\u000a      accessibility, secured long-term\u000a      retention in print, and made the word indexes and translations searchable,\u000a      enhancing\u000a      accessibility of content and offering an indispensable resource for\u000a      unfamiliar late Greek word\u000a      usage. In particular, the online availability of the word indices to these\u000a      volumes substantially\u000a      supplements the otherwise very limited information about late antique\u000a      Greek philosophical\u000a      terminology provided in Liddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon. Indeed these\u000a      indices collectively\u000a      represent the largest single corpus for that terminology, and can be used\u000a      by translators and\u000a      classicists working on related texts and by lexicographers. This has\u000a      widened and consolidated the\u000a      project's contribution to the preservation and presentation of our\u000a      intellectual heritage.\u000a    The project constitutes a significant publishing enterprise, facilitated\u000a      by tremendous fundraising\u000a      success. For example, in the USA, the first 60 volumes have sold 45,574\u000a      copies to date. In the EU\u000a      and the UK, the series sold 2,143 copies across the 100 titles in the past\u000a      twelve months alone.\u000a      Overall the project has received in excess of &#163;2.25m from government and\u000a      private funding bodies,\u000a      as well as from private individuals, with donations ranging from &#163;1,000 to\u000a      &#163;500K, as detailed in\u000a      section 3.\u000a    The Project has been led by Prof. Richard Sorabji (retired from King's in\u000a      2000) and, since 2000,\u000a      with the assistance of Prof. Peter Adamson (at King's from 2000-present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41641","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    [a] Overseas Development Assistance\u000a    Cartwright's work brought her to the attention of a number of bodies\u000a      concerned with policy (and\u000a      with the right ways for evidence to impact on policy) in the US as well as\u000a      in the UK. For example, a\u000a      study was commissioned in 2011 by the DFID (Department for International\u000a      Development) into\u000a      `Broadening the Range of Designs and Methods for Impact Evaluations' [6]\u000a      with the particular\u000a      impact at issue here being that of aid initiatives. Cartwright was\u000a      extensively consulted as an\u000a      advisor to the study team headed by Elliot Stern. The Study Group\u000a      published their DFID Report in\u000a      2012. Stern [7] wrote to Cartwright on publication: `I am grateful for\u000a      your inputs both active (in your\u000a      very helpful comments) and indirectly by informing us through your\u000a      writings.' There are 14\u000a      references to Cartwright's work (often leading into extensive\u000a      presentations of her views) in the\u000a      Report [6] especially to her [1] and [2]]; the Appendix, characterised as\u000a      a `Background Paper' to\u000a      the Report and with the title `Models of Causality and Causal Inference`\u000a      draws almost entirely and\u000a      in detail on her approach; section 3.62 entitled `The `strength' of causal\u000a      influence' draws on her\u000a      distinction between `clinchers' and `vouchers' [Cartwright [1])]; and\u000a      section 4.5 is entitled `Impact\u000a      Evaluation Question 4: Will the Intervention Work Elsewhere?' which is the\u000a      central question that\u000a      Cartwright is addressing in her work. Donor agencies (including the World\u000a      Bank, OECD, and\u000a      country donors such as DFID) have organised conferences discussing the\u000a      report's findings and\u000a      have used its findings in staff training. Stern co-produced a report for\u000a      the Research Program on\u000a      Aquatic Agricultural systems (part of the Collaborative Group on\u000a      International Agricultural\u000a      Research), which explicitly cites Cartwright and draws on her analysis of\u000a      causation and evidence\u000a      (see [8]). Through the DFID report, Michael Woolcock, Lead Social\u000a      Development Specialist at the\u000a      World Bank's Development Research Group, has become influenced by\u000a      Cartwright's views &#8212; a\u000a      recent working paper [9] makes much of Cartwright and Hardie's book. And\u000a      Cartwright's ideas are\u000a      influencing researchers at the World Bank more generally (see, e.g.,\u000a      [10]).\u000a    [b] Mental Health Care Provision\u000a    The New Savoy Partnership is a grouping of organisations &#8212; including the\u000a      Royal College of\u000a      Psychiatrists, the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP), Mind\u000a      and several others &#8212;\u000a      aimed at improving mental health care provision in the UK. It had noted\u000a      that concerns had been\u000a      raised by a Health Select Committee Inquiry in 2007 about the evaluation\u000a      methodology used by\u000a      NICE (the National Institute for Clinical Excellence) for `talking\u000a      therapies'. The Partnership\u000a      determined in 2011 to return to this issue with a view to affecting NICE\u000a      procedures directly. A\u000a      working party was set up with Cartwright as a member. This led to a\u000a      roundtable discussion which\u000a      produced a series of questions to be raised at a Keynote Panel discussion\u000a      at the\u000a      Partnership's Conference in September 2011 &#8212; this panel was chaired by Sir\u000a      Michael Rawlins,\u000a      then Head of NICE and included Cartwright (see [11]).\u000a    The views of the working party were published in a report by UKCP [12].\u000a      In line with Cartwright's\u000a      views, this report suggests `that an over-reliance on RCT evidence is\u000a      likely to impair and distort\u000a      guideline recommendations for psychological therapies'. It points out\u000a      ([12], p.5) that `what works in\u000a      a particular place [may be] less good at predicting whether something\u000a      would work for other people\u000a      in other places; and suggests that `studies need to focus much more on how\u000a      treatments work\u000a      (mechanisms of change) and the factors that support or hinder them in\u000a      different ... contexts' (pp. 5-6).\u000a      These points are at the core of Cartwright's work. The group subsequently\u000a      agreed a\u000a      `consensus statement on evidence' [13] submitted to NICE as a proposed\u000a      `starting point for NICE\u000a      to review its approach'. Cartwright was one of 9 initial signatories of\u000a      this statement. This in turn\u000a      informed the submission made by UKCP to the Health Select Committee\u000a      Inquiry into NICE in\u000a      Autumn 2012 which called, inter alia, for a `more pluralistic approach to\u000a      the evidence base around\u000a      effective treatments in relation to mental health'. At that 2012 Health\u000a      Select Committee Inquiry the\u000a      incoming head of NICE, Professor David Haslam, committed himself to a\u000a      review of the way NICE\u000a      assesses the effectiveness of psychological therapies &#8212; discussions with\u000a      NICE are on-going and\u000a      changes to their Public Health Guidelines in line with UKCP's proposals\u000a      are expected ([14]).\u000a    [c] The Munro Report\u000a    Professor Eileen Munro from the LSE's Social Policy Department became\u000a      interested in\u000a      Cartwright's work on causes and evidence, and was one of the researchers\u000a      on the project\u000a      `Evidence for Use' led by Cartwright and housed at the LSE's CPNSS. The\u000a      two did research\u000a      together leading to a joint paper in 2010 ([15]). This paper shows the\u000a      extent to which Munro's\u000a      views on evidence for the effectiveness of intervention were shaped by\u000a      Cartwright's. It considers\u000a      the case of multisystemic therapy, `an internationally adopted\u000a      intervention to try to diminish\u000a      antisocial behaviour in young people'. It argues, following Cartwright's\u000a      general line, that evidence\u000a      for the effectiveness of this therapy has incorrectly been sought in terms\u000a      of RCTs and the like,\u000a      whereas the issue of whether the therapy will work in practice requires a\u000a      much more subtle view of\u000a      the evidence &#8212; essentially looking to build up evidence for the existence\u000a      of a stable capacity. ([15],\u000a      pp.260-3)\u000a    At the time that this joint research was published (2010), Munro was\u000a      asked by the Secretary of\u000a      State for Education to review the UK child protection system in the wake\u000a      of `Baby P' and other\u000a      cases. She produced her final Report in 2011 ([16]).\u000a      Unsurprisingly the approach to evidence that\u000a      Munro took in producing that Report reflects Cartwright's\u000a      influence. According to Munro ([17]),\u000a      Cartwright's work, `helped form ... the whole approach [taken in the Report]\u000a      to the real role of\u000a      research findings in [the] area and especially to the role of expertise\u000a      and expert reasoning'. And\u000a      she further attests (ibid.):\u000a    The Report, in particular chapter 6, and even more especially\u000a      sections 6.31 to 6.39 bear the\u000a      direct hallmarks of Cartwright's analysis. It would have been very\u000a      different without her impact\u000a      that helped me clarify my thinking on the role and limitations of research\u000a      findings and to have\u000a      confidence to challenge the dominant version of evidence-based practice.\u000a      These sections\u000a      have the title `Using Evidence' and then cover a range of types of\u000a      evidence. Without\u000a      Cartwright's influence on my work, I would have gone along with the\u000a      dominant usage where\u000a      `evidence' is being equated with \"empirical research findings\".\u000a    The Report made 15 recommendations, all of which were accepted by\u000a      the Government ([18]), thus\u000a      producing major changes in the education of social workers involved in\u000a      child care, the appraisal of\u000a      their work and impact, and the child care system in general ([19], [20]).\u000a      The Report has also had\u000a      impact beyond the UK. For example, Munro was asked to give evidence to two\u000a      state government\u000a      reviews of child care in Australia and a charity in Queensland is running\u000a      a campaign to persuade\u000a      the state government to learn from her work.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Nancy Cartwright has undertaken highly influential research on causation,\u000a      evidence for causes,\u000a      and the generalizability of evidence from one context to another.

This research goes back to\u000a      Peter Urbach and was\u000a      continued by John Worrall. Nancy Cartwright, as well as developing her own\u000a      slant on the initial\u000a      issues, has importantly extended the discussion in a number of ways; in\u000a      particular by extending the\u000a      analysis (a) beyond medicine to the social sciences where RCT methodology\u000a      has also become\u000a      particularly prominent; and thence (b) to the area of the impact of\u000a      evidence (whether from RCTs or\u000a      other research studies) on policy [References 1-5].\u000a    There are a number of innovations in Cartwright's approach, but the\u000a      central contribution of interest\u000a      here concerns the issue of the generalizability of evidence for the\u000a      effectiveness of some proposed\u000a      treatment from the precise conditions of a clinical trial to the\u000a      invariably messier situation in which\u000a      we would like to apply the treatment. Her work argues that, even supposing\u000a      that randomizing gives\u000a      us perfect information about the effectiveness of an intervention within a\u000a      trial, it by no means\u000a      follows (either in medicine or in the social realm) that that intervention\u000a      will work `for us' &#8212; i.e. in\u000a      some non-trial situation to which we might apply it. She highlights a\u000a      number of cases in which the\u000a      results of trials failed (often spectacularly) to generalize.\u000a    This problem has often been discussed under the heading of `external\u000a      validity'. Cartwright's\u000a      original contribution is best understood against the background of her\u000a      detailed and influential\u000a      analysis of causation in terms of `capacities'. Cartwright shows what\u000a      conditions must be assumed\u000a      to hold if indeed some experimental result is to generalize in the\u000a      appropriate way; shows how\u000a      robust those assumptions are; and indicates carefully the sorts of\u000a      evidence that we need if we are\u000a      to have any grounds for supposing that those assumptions do indeed hold.\u000a      She analyses what it\u000a      means for a factor to have a `stable capacity to promote some outcome' and\u000a      argues that we have\u000a      grounds for holding that evidence is likely to generalise only if that\u000a      evidence includes evidence for\u000a      some stable capacity. She shows that no RCT on its own can establish (or\u000a      even provide strong\u000a      evidence for) the existence of stable capacities (and nor can any other\u000a      single investigation in the\u000a      tradition of Mill's method of difference). She also shows in detail the\u000a      sorts of epistemic problems\u000a      that need to be overcome if we are to claim evidence for capacities. Her\u000a      conclusion is that there is\u000a      no escaping the reliance on background theories. This runs contrary to the\u000a      underlying view of\u000a      RCT-advocates who (erroneously) see the chief virtue of RCTs as that of\u000a      ruling out all possible\u000a      confounders and hence being independent of theory.\u000a    Cartwright's work, then, has important implications for policy both in\u000a      medicine and in social science\u000a      and policy: having grounds to think that some intervention will work in\u000a      the way its proponents\u000a      would like it to can never be a question of just doing sufficiently many\u000a      and sufficiently careful RCTs\u000a      (or Mill's methods studies more generally). We must be aware of the\u000a      difficulties and complexities\u000a      involved in the `will it work for us' issue and, where necessary, learn to\u000a      handle uncertainty. This\u000a      has helped promote a much more nuanced view of evidence in these areas.\u000a    Key Researchers: All of the work and impact cited here was carried\u000a      out while Cartwright was a\u000a      staff member at LSE from 1991-2012.

For example, he organised a series of public debates and events\u000a      stemming specifically from the underpinning research described above. He\u000a      also engaged in several media interviews (particularly surrounding the\u000a      topic of `smart drugs') and wrote for a general audience on topics\u000a      concerning `smart drugs' and doping in sport in OpenDemocracy, the\u000a      Huffington Post and The Philosophers Magazine. In addition\u000a      a letter written to the New York Times on the topic of health care\u000a      has been used by the United Steelworkers Union (USA) as a model of how\u000a      stakeholders should express their positions in a public forum [S1].\u000a      Meacham also participated in a `Festival of Ideas' \/\u000a        mircophilosophy@foyles public event with Professor Steve Fuller.\u000a      They discussed Fuller's recent book `Humanity 2.0' in front of around 100\u000a      members of the public. The model of intersubjective relations developed in\u000a      the underpinning research was used as a counterpoint to Fuller's arguments\u000a      about post-human future of humanity [S3].\u000a    In December 2011, Meacham organised and moderated a public debate\u000a      `Experiencing Disability: The right to be impaired vs. the legacy of\u000a      eugenics', held at the Watershed Media Centre in Bristol. The event\u000a      consisted of short presentations by Professor Christien van den Anker\u000a      (UWE), a political theorist and disability rights activist, and Alex\u000a      McKeown (University of Bristol) followed by a discussion and debate. The\u000a      presentations addressed the lived-experience of impairment and how the\u000a      legacy of eugenics in its various forms impacts upon the lived experience\u000a      of impairment. This links directly to the phenomenological approach to\u000a      health and enhancement that Meacham developed in the underpinning\u000a      research. The ethics of `liberal eugenics' is a major topic in the\u000a      discourse around `enhancement and health'. Attitudes often accepted by the\u000a      general public were challenged at the event, which was attended by more\u000a      than eighty people. For example, an interior designer for impaired people\u000a      wrote: `I found it interesting because the presentation challenged ideas\u000a      and put forward a personal experience of this world that was very\u000a      relevant, yet different to my experience. As professionally I have to\u000a      engage with design for disability, it was useful for raising awareness.'\u000a      [S2]. Professor van den Anker's contribution to the debate will appear in\u000a      a volume, Medicine and Society: New Continental Perspectives,\u000a      edited by Meacham.\u000a    The `Experiencing Disability' event was part of a series of public\u000a      seminars and debates on the theme of `Medicine and Society', sponsored by\u000a      the Royal Institute of Philosophy. These also included talks by Dr Niall\u000a      Keane (Limerick) on the `Enigma of Health', Dr John Sellars (Birkbeck\u000a      College) on `Stoicism and Cognitive Psychotherapy', Professor S.K. Toombs\u000a      (Baylor) on `Three Primary Manifestations of Vulnerability in Illness',\u000a      and Dr. Eran Dorfman (Tel Aviv) on `Writing on Illness and Other Emergency\u000a      Phenomena'. All of these talks were held at a local cultural venue and\u000a      each attracted capacity audiences of more than forty people. Impact from\u000a      these events have included Niall Keane being invited back to Bristol to\u000a      give a masterclass with Meacham on health and hermeneutics to nursing and\u000a      other medical professionals. The podcast from Toombs's talk has also been\u000a      provided for use in nursing education [S4]. S.K. Toombs was a pioneer of\u000a      the phenomenological approach to health and impairment that is further\u000a      developed in the underpinning research.\u000a    The final `Medicine and Society' event was a public debate on the use of\u000a      so-called `smart drugs' in education (9 January 2013). The idea for a\u000a      debate on the ethics and fundamental questions surrounding the use of\u000a      `cognitive enhancing' pharmaceuticals was based in the approach to doping\u000a      that was developed in `Outliers, Freaks and Cheats: Constituting Normality\u000a      in the Age of Enhancement' [R3 above]. The aim of the `Should Students\u000a      Take Smart Drugs?' debate was to involve stakeholders in the debate over\u000a      the use of `cognitive enhancement' drugs in education, including those who\u000a      are responsible or will be responsible for designing and implementing\u000a      secondary school and university policy concerning the use of cognitive\u000a      enhancing pharmaceuticals in education. The event attracted considerable\u000a      media attention leading to interviews with Meacham in the following media\u000a      outlets: BBC Bristol Morning News, Heart Radio evening news, Jack FM\u000a      evening news, and BBC Gloucestershire morning news. The event was also\u000a      discussed on the BBC web pages [S5]. As a result of the debate, the UWE\u000a      student newspaper The Western Eye called for the university to develop a\u000a      `smart drugs policy' [S6].\u000a    Stakeholder Feedback from the debate included the following comments\u000a      [S7]:\u000a    \u000a      The event definitely provided me with an expanded view point on the\u000a        issue, and made me aware of new perspectives. Given that info, I would\u000a        absolutely be interested in a future public event similar to this one.\u000a        Overall I think it was a success!\u000a      It made me question the efficacy of SMART drugs and whether there was\u000a        any proven evidence of their effectiveness. The discussions around the\u000a        topic also gave me an insight to other disadvantages of these drugs\u000a        which I hadn't considered before\u000a      I came to the event with misgivings (about use of `Smart Drugs') that\u000a        I was quite willing to have dispelled, as I wasn't entirely sure they\u000a        weren't based on ignorance, and I would be very interested in a bit of\u000a        cognitive enhancement. But I was interested to hear that many on the\u000a        panel, and a pharmacologist in the audience, also had informed doubts\u000a        and objections. There are still so many questions and risks involved.\u000a      (The) evidence of efficacy or lack of (was) interesting [from a\u000a        neuropsychologist's point of view]\u000a    \u000a    The smart drugs debate was complemented by three general audience pieces\u000a      written by Meacham in OpenDemocracy [S8], Huffington Post\u000a      [S9], and The Philosophers' Magazine [S10]. All of these pieces\u000a      present for a lay audience and are based upon positions developed in the\u000a      underpinning research.

This\u000a      approach risks neglecting the embodied and socially embedded nature of the\u000a      subject. Meacham's research favours an approach that places greater\u000a      emphasis on the role of bodily and intersubjective relations in\u000a      structuring the subject and its ethical relations. The phenomenological\u000a      approach to the embodied and social dimensions of subjectivity was\u000a      developed in [R1] and [R2]. These two pieces developed a theory of the\u000a      subject and intersubjectivity around the concepts of `Institution' and\u000a      `Style'.\u000a    Drawing on the conceptual framework elaborated in this fundamental\u000a      research, [R3] addressed the question of doping as a violation of `human\u000a      nature' and the `normal' in sport. [R3] argues that negative attitudes\u000a      toward enhancement in sport are connected to a discomfort with a perceived\u000a      violation of the `normal'. Using Husserl's phenomenology, Meacham argues\u000a      that an ideal norm of experience is something that structures experience\u000a      in its sharedness, and that it forms something like the pole around which\u000a      a common world of collective projects can be formed. Discomfort with\u000a      enhancement in sport&#8212;the most visible arena for enhancement technology&#8212;can\u000a      be linked the idea of losing (to greater or lesser degree) the pole of a\u000a      commonly experienced world in which collective praxis is based. While this\u000a      must be separated from a narrow moral outrage with cheating, it does\u000a      relate to the aesthetics of sport: human capacity is understood as a kind\u000a      of common project, and watching the way it gets pushed creates a sort of\u000a      aesthetic pleasure. By blurring the parameters of sport as a common\u000a      project, enhancement can harm the aesthetic experience of sport.\u000a    This research began with an invitation to speak at a workshop on human\u000a      nature and athletic enhancement at the University of Leuven in March 2011.\u000a      The paper was published as a book chapter in January 2013. Meacham was at\u000a      UWE for the duration of the research.\u000a    Meacham is further developing the theoretical basis for the argument made\u000a      in [R3]. In a paper titled, `Empathy and Alteration: The Ethical Relevance\u000a      of a Phenomenological Species Concept', he argues that ethical behaviour,\u000a      and in particular relations of solidarity, are founded in an experience of\u000a      empathy, which entails sharing a common world and similar enough\u000a      structures of experience. The paper contends that, in terms of relations\u000a      of solidarity, it is especially important to be able to empathize with\u000a      another's experiences of illness or vulnerability to illness and injury.\u000a      Meacham explores whether some forms of enhancement technology might weaken\u000a      these relations of empathy and the bonds of solidarity that they underpin\u000a      and addresses the manner in which the `species integrity' question is\u000a      dealt with in the literature, arguing that both sides of the debate\u000a      (species integrity matters ethically or not) miss the point that what is\u000a      ethically salient is how others are experienced and this is not a question\u000a      of biological taxonomy. Versions of the paper have been presented at a\u000a      conference on Human Enhancement at the University of Texas, Dallas (April\u000a      2011) and the University of Bristol Philosophy of Medicine Seminar Series\u000a      (March 2013). It is currently in press in the Journal of Medicine and\u000a        Philosophy.\u000a    Meacham has argued that the potential social and political impact of\u000a      enhancement is best studied phenomenologically, i.e. in terms of how the\u000a      meanings of ethical and social structures are constituted by subjects'\u000a      lived and embodied relations to the world and to others. He has also\u000a      argued that this phenomenological approach has distinct advantages over\u000a      approaches that might attempt to apply abstract ethical theory to the\u000a      novel ethical and social situations that human enhancement technologies\u000a      may present.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42447","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Carel has employed a variety of means to ensure public and professional\u000a      engagement with her research, resulting in widespread influence and uptake\u000a      among a diverse range of people and stakeholders. Particular emphasis has\u000a      been placed on maximising knowledge exchange through interaction with\u000a      health practitioners.\u000a    Carel's book, Illness, received an enthusiastic reception. It was\u000a      shortlisted for the Wellcome Trust Book Prize 2009 and was swiftly\u000a      translated into several languages. A doctor at Cheltenham Royal Hospital\u000a      wrote that \"as a doctor who tries and regularly fails to get things right,\u000a      it has already informed my practice and views\" [S1]. The AHRC, in its\u000a      annual report 2009\/10, highlighted the exemplary nature of its influence\u000a      on health professionals and policy makers [S2]. Patients also valued the\u000a      book as helping them understand and articulate their own perspective of\u000a      illness [S3]. The book is currently used in the teaching of medical\u000a      students in numerous universities including Cambridge, Cornell, Duke,\u000a      Temple, Bristol, Durham, Lancaster, Central Lancashire, Aberdeen and Kings\u000a      College London [S4]. Its impact has spread well beyond the health\u000a      professional arena, for example inspiring the work of artist Kamina Walton\u000a      who quoted from Carel's book in her touring exhibition `Heavy Words,\u000a      stories from the cervix: a visual exploration of cervical cancer\" [S5].\u000a    Illness triggered an international debate on the experience and\u000a      understanding of illness through widespread media coverage and internet\u000a      discussions. For example, an interview on Australia's ABC Radio's The\u000a      Philosopher's Zone [S5] and a video debate on the meaning of pain for\u000a      iai.tv (philosophy for our times: cutting edge debates and talks from the\u000a      world's leading thinkers) [S7]. Among the many blogs that discuss the\u000a      book, an example [S8] from New Zealand commented that it is \"a book I\u000a      would recommend for anyone &#8212; healthy and non-philosophically inclined\u000a      included &#8212; because inevitably, directly or indirectly, sooner or later,\u000a      the way you yourself and society around you thinks about illness will have\u000a      a major impact on your life.\"\u000a    As a consequence of the widespread interest in her work, Carel\u000a      participated in book festivals, such as the Dartington Literary Festival\u000a      (2009), the Durham Book Festival (2010) and `How the Light Gets In' (the\u000a      philosophy and music festival at Hay on Wye) (2012). She appeared on Radio\u000a      3's Free Thinking Festival (2010) and discussed the book and its practical\u000a      application in the medical arena with numerous groups of physicians and\u000a      nurses at events such as Medfest (2011), Medicine Unboxed (2011) and the\u000a      `Schwartz Center Rounds' in Gloucester and Cheltenham Hospitals (supported\u000a      by the Kings' Fund and designed to help healthcare staff provide\u000a      compassionate care). Carel's work was at the core of a multidisciplinary\u000a      research network supported by AHRC on `Concepts of Health, Illness and\u000a      Disease'. The book's reach has even extended into prisons; in a pilot\u000a      project at Erlestoke Prison, Wiltshire, inmates were able to relate the\u000a      book's discussion of a changed geography and a new relationship to space\u000a      brought about through illness to their own experience of dislocation as\u000a      prisoners.\u000a    In a podcast interview with Carel and a feature article in the AHRC\u000a      research magazine Carel's two-year network grant was flagged up by the\u000a      AHRC as promoting innovative high-impact research [S2]. It also resulted\u000a      in a multidisciplinary and accessible volume (Health, Illness and\u000a        Disease, Acumen, 2012)\u000a    The AHRC project included public events that were free, open to all, and\u000a      widely advertised. Each event was attended by more than 100 members of the\u000a      public, health professionals and other practitioners. For example, an\u000a      event on \"Addiction: should we penalise or treat?\" held at the Watershed,\u000a      Bristol (2010) received widespread coverage in local media and attracted\u000a      many health and social care practitioners. Analysis of more than 50\u000a      feedback forms showed that around two thirds of practitioners believed\u000a      that the event had provided them with new ways of thinking about their\u000a      professional practice which would continue to influence their work. One\u000a      participant wrote that \"the event impacted on my practice in understanding\u000a      that how we frame our attitudes to the client affects their ideas of\u000a      agency\" [S10]. At a similar event on `Organ Donation' more than three\u000a      quarters of participants said that it had provided new ways of thinking\u000a      about their practice and many said, on a personal level, that it had made\u000a      them re-think the need for an open discussion about organ donation with\u000a      family members [S10]. The events were made available as freely accessible\u000a      podcasts.\u000a    Carel's publications have engaged the medical profession in particular;\u000a      for example, her British Medical Journal article has been\u000a      downloaded nearly 3,000 times. Her work with health professionals has also\u000a      included invitations to speak at high profile meetings such as keynotes to\u000a      the British Medical Acupuncture Society Annual Conference 2010 and the\u000a      British Pain Society Annual Conference 2011. Not content with simply\u000a      disseminating her research, Carel has sought to engage health professional\u000a      directly by designing and running bespoke workshops. Piloted on nurses and\u000a      physiotherapists, the workshops have since been used with groups of\u000a      psychiatry trainees, respiratory registrars and respiratory nurses. These\u000a      workshops enable participants to reflect on their professional practice,\u000a      making them aware of and influencing, their underlying thinking about the\u000a      human body.\u000a    Proactive engagement with the media has brought Carel's work to a wider\u000a      public audience. She has written for the Independent and The\u000a        Daily Telegraph [S8] and been interviewed on BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio\u000a      Bristol, Y-net, Israel and ABC Radio, Australia [S6]. She has received\u000a      many responses and reactions to her public engagement work and continues\u000a      to exert influence in key policy areas and in cognate fields. For example,\u000a      she has been invited to act as an advisor to the King's Fund on the\u000a      benefit to patients of the `Schwartz Center Rounds' (2013) and her work as\u000a      been commended by Sir Tom Shakespeare, Disability Advisor to the WHO at an\u000a      event at the Sage, Gateshead as part of the Free Thinking Festival (BBC\u000a      Radio 3, 2010).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Havi Carel's work on the experience of illness has had wide-ranging and\u000a      significant impact on health professionals, patients and their families,\u000a      policy makers and health researchers throughout the world. Her influential\u000a      book, Illness, sparked a public debate on the importance of the\u000a      first-person experience of illness.

It consisted of four main\u000a      strands: 1. A philosophical examination of how illness is experienced by\u000a      patients; 2. The development of a phenomenological analysis of this\u000a      experience; 3. An application of this analysis to healthcare provision;\u000a      and 4. An examination of the effects of ill health on wellbeing.\u000a    Building on Carel's earlier research which examined happiness (or\u000a      wellbeing) and its relationship to health [R1] and the concept of death\u000a      [R2], the project began by identifying a deficiency in the naturalistic\u000a      approach to illness and proposing to augment naturalism with a\u000a      phenomenological perspective. It then developed this phenomenological\u000a      approach in two monographs and a series of papers.\u000a    Carel's main claims are that medicine and healthcare as practised in the\u000a      West overlook the lived experience of illness, and that phenomenology\u000a      provides a useful framework to explore this experience and communicate it\u000a      to health professionals [R3, R4, R5]. In these publications, Carel\u000a      identified several problems that arise from this oversight, notably: the\u000a      hampering of patient-physician communication; a limited understanding of\u000a      noncompliance; medical interventions that are not amply informed by\u000a      patient needs and preferences; a feeling of alienation among patients from\u000a      healthcare provision and healthcare institutions; and patients not being\u000a      supported in trying to make sense of their illness [R3, R4].\u000a    The research was first presented in a book, Illness [R3]. The\u000a      ideas were then worked out in detail and published as academic research\u000a      publications (8 articles in peer reviewed journals, 5 book chapters and 3\u000a      edited collections) with the support of AHRC, Leverhulme Trust and British\u000a      Academy research fellowships and grants. Given the focus of the work, some\u000a      of the underpinning research was also published in prestigious medical\u000a      journals such as the Lancet [R6] and the British Medical\u000a        Journal, (2010), as well as in leading philosophy of medicine\u000a      journals [R4, R5]. It also featured in two journal special issues (Studies\u000a        in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences\u000a      41(4) (2010) and Philosophy 67 (2012)), and an edited collection (Health,\u000a        Illness and Disease, Acumen, 2012).\u000a    Emerging from this research, Carel developed a phenomenological toolkit\u000a      for patients aimed at exploring their personal experiences of illness and\u000a      changes to their lives caused by illness. The toolkit also communicates\u000a      aspects of patient experience that are not well understood [R4]. The\u000a      toolkit has been (and continues to be) presented to patient groups and\u000a      groups of medical staff and has been a key means of influencing people's\u000a      perception of illness and enhancing professional healthcare practice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43372","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The project's rationale was, firstly, that the best and most gripping\u000a      contemporary philosophical puzzles require no prior knowledge of\u000a      philosophy (if explained clearly and concisely enough); secondly, that\u000a      there is a growing demand for academic podcasts among laypersons, with the\u000a      internet providing a user-friendly and easily-accessed platform for\u000a      distribution.\u000a    `Lotteries' and `Lotteries II' Podcast Episodes\u000a    In `Lotteries' and `Lotteries II', the lottery puzzle was presented in\u000a      the form of a dilemma: can you know that your lottery ticket has lost,\u000a      after the draw but prior to the announcement? If you can, then it is hard\u000a      to explain why you bought it in the first place, why you are unwilling to\u000a      sell it for 1p, or why it's improper for you to assert `I know my ticket\u000a      has lost'. If you cannot, then any explanation of this knowledge failure\u000a      seems to generalize to many other propositions that you ordinarily think\u000a      you do know, e.g. that your car is now parked where you left it, or that\u000a      you will go to work tomorrow. The podcast considers some of the standard\u000a      responses to this puzzle and outlines their advantages and the problems\u000a      that beset them. The debate on issues raised by Dodd's 2012 paper is\u000a      traced in some detail.\u000a    Work on the episode script of `Lotteries' began in September 2011 and\u000a      recording and editing took place in mid-October 2011. The episode\u000a      `Lotteries' was first made available for download on October 16, 2011. As\u000a      of September 19th, 2013, it had been downloaded 5,808 times. This served\u000a      as the foundation for more in-depth discussion of the philosophical issues\u000a      arising from lotteries, with McGlynn's recently worked-out views\u000a      providing a strong impetus. Work on the episode `Lotteries II' began in\u000a      early May 2012, and the complete episode was first made available for\u000a      download on June 12, 2012.

The driving question\u000a      of this debate is: is it possible for two people to genuinely disagree\u000a      about some gustatory, aesthetic, or moral matter without either party\u000a      being somehow mistaken? The podcast considers the contextualist, realist\u000a      and relativist replies, and explains the limits of these responses\u000a      observed in the current literature. Work on this episode began in early\u000a      November 2011, with weekly Relativism and Rational Tolerance\u000a      project seminars providing a fertile backdrop. `Faultless Disagreement'\u000a      was made available for download on Dec 14, 2011.

The main\u000d\u000a      aim of these activities is not simply to disseminate research by exposing\u000d\u000a      non-academic groups to cutting-edge research issues in philosophy; it is\u000d\u000a      also&#8212;and crucially&#8212;to involve such groups in the NIP-inspired practice of\u000d\u000a      collaborative discussion, where views are put forward, revised and\u000d\u000a      sharpened in the light of friendly criticism in order to reach a deeper\u000d\u000a      understanding of genuinely puzzling issues.

The aim of\u000d\u000a      the course was to introduce primary and secondary schoolteachers to the\u000d\u000a      benefits of using the collaborative group discussion model of NIP in a\u000d\u000a      classroom setting. Both courses were fully booked, with a total of 38\u000d\u000a      educators in attendance.

Since January 2012 Luzzi\u000d\u000a      has run twenty-eight hour-long Philosophy group discussions with pupils\u000d\u000a      from St Peter's Primary School. From January to July 2012 he worked with a\u000d\u000a      P5 class while from January to March 2013 he worked with a P3 and a P6\u000d\u000a      class. A total of 60 pupils were involved.\u000d\u000a    Since 2011, NIP has obtained funding from the Royal Institute of\u000d\u000a      Philosophy to run Philosophy courses of 15 contact hours in local\u000d\u000a      secondary schools. The courses' topics are taken from areas of strong\u000d\u000a      research expertise and the NIP model of collaborative group discussion is\u000d\u000a      typically implemented in these sessions. Collaborations have taken place\u000d\u000a      with Dyce Academy (Luzzi, Spring 2011, 60 pupils), Albyn School (Melis\u000d\u000a      (PhD student), Spring 2012, 70 pupils; Spring 2013, 70 pupils), and Robert\u000d\u000a      Gordon's College (Luzzi, Spring 2011, 50 pupils; Melis,\u000d\u000a      Spring 2012, 35 pupils).\u000d\u000a    The NIP research model of collaborative discussion of central\u000d\u000a      philosophical questions encompasses all four streams. The specific\u000d\u000a      research outputs mentioned in section 3 were used as foundations in the\u000d\u000a      development and refinement of lesson plans with accompanying activities\u000d\u000a      and stimuli for group discussion that were used in three of the streams:\u000d\u000a      social partnerships, school collaborations and public engagement. For\u000d\u000a      example, in the wake of research activity on the \"Basic Knowledge\"\u000d\u000a      project, NIP developed a lesson plan centered on the topic of so-called\u000d\u000a      `lottery' scepticism for use in non-academic settings. Initially, this was\u000d\u000a      tested as one of the Philosophy sessions of five five-session mini-courses\u000d\u000a      running at Robert Gordon's College (22, 23 and 24 March 2011) and two\u000d\u000a      five-session mini-courses at Dyce Academy (23, 25 March 2011). On the\u000d\u000a      basis of this experience, the lesson plan was revised and adjusted for use\u000d\u000a      as part of five five-week Philosophy courses at Albyn School (March 2012);\u000d\u000a      as part of three five-week Philosophy courses at Robert Gordon's College\u000d\u000a      (March 2012); as part of two six-week Philosophy courses on the Lifeshapers\u000d\u000a      programme for young unemployed persons and ex-drug abusers run by the\u000d\u000a      charity AberdeenFoyer (25 June 2012, 05 Sep 2012); as part of a three-week\u000d\u000a      Philosophy course for prisoners at HM Prison Aberdeen Grampian (6 July\u000d\u000a      2012); for an Aberdeen Skeptics in the Pub public engagement\u000d\u000a      session (22 November 2012, Cellar 32 pub, audience of 23).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    NIP Public is the Northern Institute of Philosophy's (NIP) programme to\u000d\u000a      propagate the benefits of NIP's own collaborative research models to local\u000d\u000a      non-academic communities, specifically schools, charities, and\u000d\u000a      non-academic institutions.

Here we will first describe the research model;\u000d\u000a      then we will describe some of the research outputs (A Case Study Part 1),\u000d\u000a      whose impact is presented in section 4 (A Case Study Part 2).\u000d\u000a    (a) The Research Model\u000d\u000a    Since the start of NIP in late 2009, research teams for each pilot or\u000d\u000a      funded NIP project&#8212; comprising the PI, postdoctoral fellows and project\u000d\u000a      students&#8212;met during term-time in weekly two- hour seminars. In each\u000d\u000a      seminar a definite cluster of research questions was investigated, with\u000d\u000a      team members critically assessing existing reasons and proposing new\u000d\u000a      reasons for various answers to these questions in collaborative group\u000d\u000a      discussion.\u000d\u000a    The key premise for exporting this model of philosophical inquiry to a\u000d\u000a      non-academic setting is that no prior expertise is needed in order for\u000d\u000a      someone to benefit from it: even complete novices to philosophy can, when\u000d\u000a      properly exposed to research themes in a clear and accessible manner and\u000d\u000a      properly guided by an expert, profitably engage with philosophical\u000d\u000a      research questions and enjoy the intellectual and social benefits of so\u000d\u000a      doing.\u000d\u000a    (b) Research Outputs\u000d\u000a    The research outputs underpinning the impact came from work undertaken on\u000d\u000a      NIP projects. One of the main foci of the AHRC-funded \"Basic Knowledge\"\u000d\u000a      project, which ran at NIP in the period 2009- 2012, was external-world\u000d\u000a        scepticism. Several research seminars were dedicated to the topic or\u000d\u000a      issues directly relevant to it. Four key research outputs arose from these\u000d\u000a      seminars and from the research presented in two \"Basic Knowledge\"\u000d\u000a      Conferences and eight two-day project workshops held during this period.\u000d\u000a      The research outputs concern ways in which we might respond to the\u000d\u000a      challenge of external-world scepticism, the view that we know very little\u000d\u000a      of what we think we know about the world around us. One recent shape this\u000d\u000a      view has taken is `lottery scepticism'. The main argument in favour of\u000d\u000a      lottery scepticism starts from the common intuition that when you hold one\u000d\u000a      ticket of a large fair lottery, you do not know&#8212;after the draw but before\u000d\u000a      the announcement&#8212;that your ticket has lost, despite its being extremely\u000d\u000a      likely that your ticket has lost. The problem generalizes dramatically. If\u000d\u000a      the reason why you can't know in the lottery scenario is that there is a\u000d\u000a      very small chance of being wrong (i.e. there is a small chance that your\u000d\u000a      ticket has won), then because there is a very small chance that our senses\u000d\u000a      deceive us, we can't know anything about the world around us. Four key\u000d\u000a      outputs from this project (Dodd (2011,2012), McGlynn (2013), Moretti\u000d\u000a      (2012) underpinned the lesson plans on external-world scepticism used in\u000d\u000a      our collaborations with local schools, HM Prison Aberdeen and the charity\u000d\u000a      AberdeenFoyer.\u000d\u000a    The NIP \"Truth and Paradox\" project and Berto's (2013) work on\u000d\u000a      dialetheism&#8212;the view that there can be true contradictions, developed as a\u000d\u000a      response to central semantic paradoxes&#8212;underpinned the Caf&#233;\u000d\u000a        Philosophique event `What Can Paradoxes Teach Us?', while the NIP\u000d\u000a      \"Relativism and Rational Tolerance\" project and Baker's (2012)\u000d\u000a      work on disagreement underpinned the Caf&#233; Philosophique event\u000d\u000a      `Should We Tolerate Moral Disagreement?' and the development of lesson\u000d\u000a      plans on disagreement used in our collaborations with local schools, HM\u000d\u000a      Prison Aberdeen and the charity AberdeenFoyer.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43487","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The initial impact of the report occurred in the period 2002-2005 in the\u000a      UK. However, its plausibility and substance &#8212; as evidence of which we\u000a      quote the initial response to the report below &#8212; has led to it having a\u000a      continuing international impact with important developments within the REF\u000a      period with a substantial range of its expected beneficiaries, namely\u000a      legislatures, the courts and policy makers in countries where genetic\u000a      patenting is a substantial issue, such as the USA and the EU.\u000a    When it was published in 2002 this report was widely regarded as a major\u000a      development in the discussion of the contentious issue of `gene patents'.\u000a      Maggie Ponder, chair of the Genetic Interest Group, said: \"Families and\u000a      individuals affected by genetic disorders wish to see the speediest\u000a      development of new understanding and techniques. They also want to see the\u000a      affordable application of this knowledge and technology. In the view of\u000a      the Genetic Interest Group, the Nuffield Council have struck the right\u000a      balance between what can be competing pressures in both research and\u000a      applications.\" Dr Robin Lovell-Badge, Head of Development Genetics at the\u000a      National Institute for Medical Research, agreed \"I think this report will\u000a      be very useful. I agree that in most cases a simple DNA sequence should\u000a      not be patentable. But it is not always so obvious that a particular DNA\u000a      sequence causes a disease, and a considerable investment of time and\u000a      resources may be involved in its discovery. In these cases it seems more\u000a      reasonable that a company should be able to protect its investment and\u000a      discovery with a patent.\" For more detailed responses at the time of\u000a      publication in 2002 from the full range of potential beneficiaries, see http:\/\/www.sciencemediacentre.org\/scientists-comment-on-dna-ethics-report-2\/\u000a    Lawyers in particular welcomed the report's approach of using well\u000a      established criteria for the validity of patents to criticise some DNA\u000a      patents as unwarranted. While a wholesale denunciation of the morality of\u000a      gene patents might have attracted popular support, it would not have had\u000a      much practical impact. Lawyers have also taken up the report's distinction\u000a      between patents based only on diagnostic tests and those based on new\u000a      methods of producing therapeutic proteins. In the USA much recent interest\u000a      in this issue has been aroused by the case started in 2009 by the American\u000a      Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to challenge the patents on breast cancer\u000a      genes granted to the Myriad Corporation on the basis of their use in\u000a      diagnostic tests for susceptibility to breast cancer. In 2010 Justice\u000a      Sweet upheld the ACLU case against Myriad in the New York Federal District\u000a      court on grounds similar to those articulated in the Nuffield Report.\u000a      Myriad's appeal against this decision was largely upheld in the Federal\u000a      Circuit Court of Appeals, but the case was sent to the US Supreme Court\u000a      which reached a complex judgment in June 2013, striking down Myriad's\u000a      patents on naturally occurring DNA sequences, but allowing the\u000a      patentability of complementary DNA sequences which lack naturally\u000a      occurring introns. In the present context, what is significant about the\u000a      debates surrounding this case is the way in which the Nuffield report is\u000a      still cited in discussions of the issues as an authoritative contribution\u000a      and the fact that the court's emphasis on the significance of the\u000a      invention\/discovery test largely replicates that in the Nuffield report.\u000a      Our case is that the evidence of reception of the report, continued\u000a      reference to it in other contexts, and structural similarity of the\u000a      reasoning, makes it plausible that this is a further evidence of its\u000a      impact.\u000a    As further evidence of the report's crossing of the Atlantic to influence\u000a      the legal debate there, and as a substantial impact on the legislature in\u000a      the US in its own right, it is notable that the report also turns up in a\u000a      US Congressional report and National Institutes of Health (NIH) briefings\u000a      in the period. Further, in their 2009 submission to the Senate Standing\u000a      Committee on Community Affairs Inquiry into Genes, the Australian Law\u000a      Reform Commission (ALRC) referred to their report on Genes and Ingenuity:\u000a      Gene Patenting and Human Health (ALRC 99, 2004). This report describes the\u000a      approach to the test for inventiveness recommended in the Nuffield report\u000a      (see 6.83-7 of the ALRC report) and in its conclusion it affirmed the\u000a      Nuffield position (see 6.95-7). A recent briefing note by the UK\u000a      Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology on this issue (taking note\u000a      of the legal debates in the USA) also cites the Nuffield report in 2012.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Ethics of Patenting DNA was a Nuffield Council on Bioethics Report by\u000a      a working party of which Thomas Baldwin was a member with responsibility\u000a      for providing the ethical framework for the report.

This Idea that there can be\u000a      fundamental but practice-based duties is an underlying principle in all\u000a      Baldwin's work in applied ethics, allowing him to avoid both relativism\u000a      and particularism while accepting that the detailed principles endorsed,\u000a      about for example patenting DNA, are dependent upon the contingencies of\u000a      the situation in which we find ourselves. We illustrate this point in more\u000a      detail below.\u000a    Baldwin's main responsibility, as the philosophical representative on the\u000a      working party assessing the ethical legitimacy of intellectual property in\u000a      respect of DNA sequences, was to elucidate the normative basis of the\u000a      present legal systems for intellectual property and assess the application\u000a      of this system to DNA sequences. Within the report his contribution occurs\u000a      largely in chapter 2 (`The patent system') and chapter 3 (`Patenting\u000a      DNA'), but the group worked closely together on all aspects of the report,\u000a      including the recommendations. Since the publication of the report he has\u000a      continued to work in this field.\u000a    The report aimed to strike a balance between wholesale rejection of\u000a      patents which involve human DNA sequences and straightforward endorsement\u000a      of the practice by patent offices. While there is considerable public\u000a      support for the former alternative since the very idea of patenting human\u000a      genes seems repugnant, it fails to take account of the development of\u000a      intellectual property (IP) law in biology during the 20th century. For\u000a      that law has accepted the principle that the production of valuable\u000a      compounds by innovative methods for purifying naturally occurring\u000a      substances does merit patent protection where their utility has been\u000a      established and disclosed. The report accepts this principle, but argues\u000a      that in some cases it has not been properly applied when used to justify\u000a      the grant of a patent to applications for patents on human DNA sequences.\u000a      For patents on DNA sequences have been granted by patent offices, and,\u000a      when challenged, confirmed by the courts, despite the facts (a) that the\u000a      methods or products on which the patents were granted had not been\u000a      properly assessed by the normal tests for inventiveness and utility, and\u000a      (b) that in some cases the patents granted were much too broad, in that\u000a      they covered speculative future applications not substantiated in the\u000a      application. The report also argues that there is an important distinction\u000a      between (i) the development of diagnostic tests which use discoveries\u000a      concerning the significance of certain human DNA sequences and (ii) the\u000a      production of synthetic proteins by novel techniques which start from\u000a      discoveries concerning the human DNA sequences which are responsible for\u000a      their production in the human body. In the first case it is argued that\u000a      the granting of patents for DNA sequences used in genetic diagnostic tests\u000a      is contrary to the traditional invention\/discovery distinction since it is\u000a      only inventions that are patentable, whereas genetic diagnostic tests rely\u000a      only on discoveries concerning the significance of certain DNA sequences.\u000a      By contrast, the granting of patents for the production of synthetic\u000a      proteins by novel techniques based on DNA sequences is in principle\u000a      acceptable, but in such cases the patent should primarily cover the method\u000a      of synthesis disclosed in the patent application and not the basic DNA\u000a      sequence as well, since that is not an invention but a discovery.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43488","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact noted in this case study is on the way that philosophy of\u000d\u000a      literature is being taught and conceived. Analytic philosophers have dealt\u000d\u000a      piecemeal with loosely related issues but these have seemed marginal in\u000d\u000a      literary circles and have never been consolidated into a coherent\u000d\u000a      `philosophy of literature' grounded in analytical methods. The anthology\u000d\u000a      provides a package of material that would be appropriate to an integrated\u000d\u000a      course on analytic approaches to both art and literature. Lamarque's\u000d\u000a      monograph goes further, advancing a highly distinctive analytic treatment\u000d\u000a      of the philosophy of literature, representing a radical departure; which\u000d\u000a      has at its core the idea of literature as an `institution' governed by\u000d\u000a      conventions and concepts with deep historical roots, although seldom given\u000d\u000a      explicit analysis, helping to explain the underlying values in both the\u000d\u000a      creation and reception of literary works. Furthermore, given the supremacy\u000d\u000a      of analytic philosophy in Anglophone Philosophy Departments, this\u000d\u000a      refocusing has also helped to bring aesthetics and the philosophy of\u000d\u000a      literature into the mainstream of philosophy.\u000d\u000a    The impact of the books is, thus, revealed, first, by the spread of\u000d\u000a      straight philosophy of literature courses now available in Higher\u000d\u000a      Education Institutions that use these books as preliminary reading or\u000d\u000a      reading around which a course is structured and, second, the recognition\u000d\u000a      of the significance of these books, or their use, in courses in related\u000d\u000a      disciplines, or by leading figures in these disciplines.\u000d\u000a    In the UK, Philosophy Departments at universities including Bristol,\u000d\u000a      Cambridge, Edinburgh, Heythrop, Lancaster, Leeds, Sheffield, St Andrews,\u000d\u000a      Warwick, and others, use one or both of the cited books as texts. Outside\u000d\u000a      the UK, Universities in Continental Europe (notably Germany, France,\u000d\u000a      Spain, Portugal, Italy, Scandinavia), Australia, New Zealand, USA, Canada,\u000d\u000a      and South Africa (see below) use these texts. Prof. Dr. Tilmann K&#246;ppe at\u000d\u000a      the University of Goettingen, Germany writes: \"I have had the opportunity\u000d\u000a      to use your excellent books for teaching purposes in literary studies\u000d\u000a      several times. Most recently, I have taught a course on \"Problems of\u000d\u000a      Literary Theory\" (fall semester 2011\/2012)\".\u000d\u000a    The monograph is also used for courses addressed at the general public,\u000d\u000a      for example, the Department of Continuing Education, Oxford, suggested\u000d\u000a      reading, also link to Lamarque's website. And it is being translated into\u000d\u000a      Persian and Chinese despite only having been available since 2008.\u000d\u000a    Currently standard approaches to literature&#8212;at least those recognized by\u000d\u000a      theorists and critics&#8212; have been based on the work of Continental\u000d\u000a      philosophers (such as Derrida, Levinas, Foucault, Kristeva and Irigerary).\u000d\u000a      Evidence that Lamarque's approach is making its mark even on literary\u000d\u000a      theory comes from Terry Eagleton's book The Event of Literature (2012),\u000d\u000a      which is a close engagement with analytical philosophy of literature, and\u000d\u000a      with Lamarque's book in particular. Eagleton is one of the most prominent\u000d\u000a      literary theorists in the world and has up to now shown virtually no\u000d\u000a      interest in the work of analytic philosophers in this field. However, in\u000d\u000a      this new book, his approach has radically changed. He writes: \"the rigour\u000d\u000a      and technical expertise of the best philosophy of literature contrasts\u000d\u000a      favourably with the intellectual looseness of some literary theory, and\u000d\u000a      has addressed questions ... left mostly unexamined by those in the other\u000d\u000a      camp\" (p.ix). There are references throughout the book to Lamarque's work:\u000d\u000a      e.g. pp.21-23, 47-56, 63-66, 80-1, etc. as well as his work with Olsen,\u000d\u000a      more so than to any other analytic philosophers.\u000d\u000a    Thus, the significance of the impact of these two books can be summed up\u000d\u000a      as follows: (a) 30 years ago the term `philosophy of literature' was\u000d\u000a      barely used, and unified analytical approaches to the topics virtually\u000d\u000a      non-existent, either in aesthetics or literary theory, but now there are\u000d\u000a      courses on this aspect of literary study in HE institutions across the\u000d\u000a      world (see below); (b) this branch of aesthetics, informed by analytical\u000d\u000a      philosophy, has acquired an identity and a focus largely through the work\u000d\u000a      of Lamarque; (c) this is having a growing influence on the way that the\u000d\u000a      theory of literature is conceived, taught and disseminated; (d) being\u000d\u000a      grounded in analytic philosophy, which is mainstream philosophy at least\u000d\u000a      across the English-speaking world, this approach to the theory of\u000d\u000a      literature shows its strong intellectual credentials; (e) it not only\u000d\u000a      introduces rigour into the articulation of the problems, but it offers\u000d\u000a      genuine insight and illumination into the very foundations of literary\u000d\u000a      study; (f) it gives students across the humanities and even in the social\u000d\u000a      sciences a radically new perspective through which to think about the arts\u000d\u000a      and literature in particular; and (g), above all, it establishes deep\u000d\u000a      intellectual links between the disciplines of literary criticism and\u000d\u000a      philosophy, as well as showing where inter-disciplinary boundaries are\u000d\u000a      justifiable and where they are porous or unfounded.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Impact arises from two books that have helped reshape and give new focus\u000d\u000a      to the teaching of philosophy of art and, in particular, the philosophy of\u000d\u000a      literature by giving wide acceptance to analytic methods and producing an\u000d\u000a      alternative paradigm to previously dominant `continental' approaches to\u000d\u000a      philosophy of literature and critical theory.

Analytic philosophers have discussed topics related to\u000d\u000a      literature before&#8212;e.g. the so-called paradox of fiction, the intentional\u000d\u000a      fallacy in criticism, the distinction between fiction \/ non-fiction, the\u000d\u000a      cognitive values of literary fiction, and the relation between ethical and\u000d\u000a      aesthetic value&#8212;but (a) there has been little attempt to integrate these\u000d\u000a      discussions into a comprehensive philosophical approach to literature, (b)\u000d\u000a      the focus has been less on specifically literary applications, more on\u000d\u000a      their relation to the wider contexts of philosophy of language, philosophy\u000d\u000a      of mind or value theory from which they arise, and as a result, (c), these\u000d\u000a      enquiries have rarely been given much attention by literary theorists or\u000d\u000a      critics. What is distinctive about Lamarque's Philosophy of Literature\u000d\u000a      (2008) is that it provides comprehensive interlinked coverage of all\u000d\u000a      central aspects of literature, viewed through the analytical lens. It\u000d\u000a      draws on a wealth of examples from literature itself and from literary\u000d\u000a      criticism in exploring fundamental features of a practice which, so it is\u000d\u000a      argued, makes possible the very existence of literary works and reveals\u000d\u000a      their role and significance in human lives.\u000d\u000a    This book and his co-edited anthology Aesthetics and the Philosophy of\u000d\u000a      Art: The Analytic Tradition: An Anthology (2004) display how a certain\u000d\u000a      approach to the problems discussed under the heading of philosophy of art\u000d\u000a      or literature could make substantial progress. In the anthology, the\u000d\u000a      selected papers in aesthetics employ only analytical methods, dating from\u000d\u000a      the early 1950s to the present, and such a selection, for use as a\u000d\u000a      teaching textbook in aesthetics, is unique. Analytic philosophers have\u000d\u000a      taught aesthetics courses before but the analytical methodology is seldom\u000d\u000a      highlighted as such and it is common in such courses to have a large\u000d\u000a      element from the history of the subject or draw upon non-analytic\u000d\u000a      approaches to philosophical engagement with literature (this is notable in\u000d\u000a      the standard teaching anthologies on aesthetics: A. Neill and A. Ridley,\u000d\u000a      eds. The Philosophy of Art: Readings Ancient and Modern, McGraw-Hill,\u000d\u000a      1994, and S. Cahn and A. Meskin, eds. Aesthetics: A Comprehensive\u000d\u000a      Anthology, Wiley-Blackwell, 2008). In contrast the Lamarque &amp; Olsen\u000d\u000a      anthology focuses on the analytic approach and reveals both its depth and\u000d\u000a      its range. The monograph The Philosophy of Literature is also unique in\u000d\u000a      essentially defining a new branch of analytic philosophy and illustrating\u000d\u000a      how analytical methods can illuminate philosophical issues about\u000d\u000a      literature (long thought of as the province of Continental philosophy and\u000d\u000a      literary theory).

The stewardship model and the\u000d\u000a      intervention ladder, in particular, have been referenced extensively by\u000d\u000a      policy makers, the legislature and governmental bodies, and continue to be\u000d\u000a      an important influence to this day. The report thus succeeded in making a\u000d\u000a      substantial contribution to a complex debate on the relationship between\u000d\u000a      the state and the individual, as well as to a topical, relevant, field of\u000d\u000a      practical policy making, reaching many potential beneficiaries of such a\u000d\u000a      research contribution.\u000d\u000a    The significance of the report was recognized when it was published in\u000d\u000a      2007 and its impact can be seen in references to it in the House of Lords\u000d\u000a      2008 debate on disease surveillance. It was also discussed extensively in\u000d\u000a      the 2012 report on Behaviour change by the House of Lords Science and\u000d\u000a      Technology select committee. Even more significant was the fact that in\u000d\u000a      2010 NICE endorsed the main themes of the report and adopted the\u000d\u000a      stewardship model as a reference point for guiding decisions about what\u000d\u000a      types of intervention may be justified. NICE has subsequently referred to\u000d\u000a      the Nuffield Report in its 2010 guidance concerning Alcohol Use Disorders\u000d\u000a      and reaffirmed the general relevance of the Nuffield approach in its\u000d\u000a      current advice for the development of public health guidance.\u000d\u000a    Baldwin's role in producing the report led to an invitation to join the\u000d\u000a      Department of Health's Expert Advisory Committee on Obesity which was\u000d\u000a      established in 2007 to advise the Government in the development of a\u000d\u000a      policy to address the problem of obesity (which had been discussed in the\u000d\u000a      Nuffield Report). The policy was eventually published in 2008 as Healthy\u000d\u000a      Weight, Healthy Lives. Although there is no explicit reference in this\u000d\u000a      paper to the Nuffield Report, Baldwin had considerable contact with the\u000d\u000a      team who drew it up and the policy follows the approach to public health\u000d\u000a      recommended in the Nuffield Report. Thus the report starts with the\u000d\u000a      following statement by Gordon Brown, who was then Prime Minister:\u000d\u000a    \"There should be no doubt that maintaining a healthy weight must be the\u000d\u000a      responsibility of individuals first &#8212; it is not the role of Government to\u000d\u000a      tell people how to live their lives and nor would this work. ...\u000d\u000a    The responsibility of Government, and wider society, is to make sure that\u000d\u000a      individuals and families have access to the opportunities they want and\u000d\u000a      the information they need in order to make healthy choices and exercise\u000d\u000a      greater control over their health and their lives. This is what Government\u000d\u000a      can do, and it is what will make a real and sustainable difference to all\u000d\u000a      of us in trying to make healthy choices and lead healthy lives\" (Healthy\u000d\u000a      Weight, Healthy Lives, p. iii).\u000d\u000a    The new coalition's public health policy document Healthy Lives, Healthy\u000d\u000a      People also draws on themes from the Nuffield report (especially the\u000d\u000a      `Nuffield intervention ladder' (see &#182;&#182;2.25-35, 29-30). Baldwin has\u000d\u000a      presented these ideas to senior staff at the Department of Health, and the\u000d\u000a      previous Secretary of State (Andrew Lansley) was been explicit in using\u000d\u000a      them, as is clear from the following report in the BMJ:\u000d\u000a    \"During a BMA organised debate on health inequalities on 28 October 2010,\u000d\u000a      England's health secretary, Andrew Lansley, was questioned over a comment\u000d\u000a      about \"collaborative working\" with the drink and food industry. ....\u000d\u000a    Mr Lansley said, \"A couple of years ago the Nuffield Council on Bioethics\u000d\u000a      produced what I found was a very helpful illustration of what they\u000d\u000a      described as a ladder or hierarchy of interventions. At the bottom of it\u000d\u000a      was to do nothing, but it went up with starting to impact on behaviour\u000d\u000a      change, influencing choices, default choices, intervention, and possibly\u000d\u000a      introducing a full ban on something'. \"We know that tobacco control is\u000d\u000a      quite high up that ladder due to the necessity of doing so because the\u000d\u000a      less intrusive measures have not delivered the objectives we are looking\u000d\u000a      for. In other areas, such as the consumption of food, we are capable of\u000d\u000a      making faster and more meaningful progress through a voluntary partnership\u000d\u000a      with the food industry than in an adversarial relationship.\"\u000d\u000a    In many other areas of public health, the Nuffield Report continues to be\u000d\u000a      cited in policy debates &#8212; e.g. concerning vaccination and fluoridisation\u000d\u000a      and, most recently, regarding the hiring of smokers; it is also cited in\u000d\u000a      regional public health reports, such as the 2012 report from the Leeds\u000d\u000a      Director of Public Health (see sources below for details).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The impact is on public health policy.

An important strand of this work has been the proper\u000d\u000a      understanding of freedom and the relationship between personal freedom and\u000d\u000a      the state's authority. In particular, since 2000 Baldwin has developed\u000d\u000a      this research in the context of problems of public health policy and\u000d\u000a      bioethics (see also `Understanding the opposition' Prenatal Diagnosis 26\u000d\u000a      (2006), 637-645).\u000d\u000a    Much of Baldwin's research into this problem was published in the report\u000d\u000a      of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Public health: the ethical issues\u000d\u000a      (2007). The report starts by developing an ethical framework for the\u000d\u000a      state's role in relation to public health which was largely developed and\u000d\u000a      written by Baldwin. Central to this framework is the `stewardship model'\u000d\u000a      for the government's responsibilities. This model implies that, without\u000d\u000a      intruding into the private lives of adult citizens to coerce them to lead\u000d\u000a      healthy lives, government has a responsibility (as `steward') to develop\u000d\u000a      and maintain a `healthy' public environment, &#8212; physical, social and\u000d\u000a      cultural &#8212; which helps its citizens lead healthier lives, not only because\u000d\u000a      this is a way of advancing the personal welfare of citizens, but also\u000d\u000a      because the maintenance of a `healthy' environment is one of the best ways\u000d\u000a      of reducing the health inequalities which are due to social and economic\u000d\u000a      circumstances. The model also supports a special emphasis on the situation\u000d\u000a      of children because they are not able to take responsibility for\u000d\u000a      themselves, though the model recognises that interests of parents require\u000d\u000a      respect. In developing policies which realise the stewardship model there\u000d\u000a      is often a tension between creating an environment with significant health\u000d\u000a      benefits and respecting personal freedoms that may be exercised in\u000d\u000a      unhealthy ways; and to help resolve these conflicts the Nuffield working\u000d\u000a      party developed an intuitive guide for assessing policies. Policies are to\u000d\u000a      be thought of as arranged on the rungs of a ladder, the `intervention\u000d\u000a      ladder' as it is called, with the most intrusive and restrictive at the\u000d\u000a      top and the least intrusive at the bottom. The stewardship model then\u000d\u000a      implies that Government policies should remain as low on the intervention\u000d\u000a      ladder as is compatible with the effective reduction of risk of serious\u000d\u000a      harm to the public. In some circumstances, e.g. where there is a threat of\u000d\u000a      a pandemic such as SARS, it is appropriate to `climb to the top of ladder'\u000d\u000a      by taking measures which radically restrict the liberty of those citizens\u000d\u000a      whose illness threatens the health of others. In other cases, e.g. food\u000d\u000a      policy, a lower-rung policy which creates an environment that encourages\u000d\u000a      healthy alternatives without imposing them is appropriate. Where such\u000d\u000a      policies are not effective, and especially where behaviour poses a health\u000d\u000a      risk to others, as in the case of smoking, stepping up a rung or two of\u000d\u000a      the ladder and restricting behaviour, especially in public places, is\u000d\u000a      deemed appropriate.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43992","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    EAP research has resulted in a series of engagements with policy makers,\u000a      mental health advocacy groups, senior members of the judiciary,\u000a      social-care and health-care professionals, and civil servants. Through\u000a      these engagements the EAP has guided and informed policy debate and\u000a      discussion of how best to implement the legal standard of best interests,\u000a      and in some cases whether best interests decision-making is acceptable at\u000a      all.\u000a    In 2010 EAP was awarded a 27-month, &#163;337,315 AHRC grant.

The EAP website hosts Green Paper Reports (7 thus far),\u000a      Technical Briefings (5), and Research Articles (6), each of which present\u000a      EAP research in a form accessible and relevant to the concerns of public\u000a      policy professionals.

The REF impact period coincided with a period\u000a      of intense scrutiny of mental health law in Ireland, where policy makers\u000a      have been debating how to write new legislation to comply with the UN\u000a      Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. One of the most\u000a      controversial issues addressed in the debate has been whether this new\u000a      legislation should incorporate best interest provisions. This debate has\u000a      culminated in the Irish parliament's publication of the Assisted\u000a      Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill in July 2013. EAP's contribution to this\u000a      process has been achieved primarily through two events. In June 2012\u000a      Martin was invited by Amnesty International Ireland to facilitate a\u000a      seminar attended by fifteen organisations, including government agencies,\u000a      professional bodies, and public sector lobbying groups, who had been\u000a      working together to develop recommendations for Irish legislators drafting\u000a      a new bill. This seminar was followed in November 2012 by a workshop\u000a      facilitated by EAP, in which Amnesty International Ireland's `citizens'\u000a      jury' were asked to explain their process and decisions to NGOs and\u000a      professionals engaged in the development of new mental health legislation\u000a      in Ireland. Martin's contribution to Amnesty's campaign on Ireland's new\u000a      legislation was well received by their Public Affairs Executive:\u000a    The Essex Autonomy project was of significant help to our mental health\u000a      campaign. Wayne Martin's expertise and enthusiasm shone through, and this\u000a      married with the unique philosophical approach was of great help...Both\u000a      workshops were successful in challenging people to be more creative in\u000a      their thinking about autonomy and were catalysts for stimulating and\u000a      challenging discussions.\u000a    Public Affairs Executive, Amnesty International Ireland\u000a    The most recent development of EAP policy impact has been their\u000a      collaboration with EDSECT, the Eating Disorders Section of the Royal\u000a      College of Psychiatrists. In April 2013, Prof Martin was invited to\u000a      facilitate a day-long meeting of EDSECT. The meeting was held at the\u000a      London headquarters of the Royal College and involved 40 professionals\u000a      from the UK and Europe who work with patients with Eating Disorders. The\u000a      focus of the meeting was a pair of Court of Protection cases in which the\u000a      MCA best interests framework had been applied for the first time to cases\u000a      involving life-threatening Anorexia Nervosa. That meeting culminated in a\u000a      collaborative session in which Prof Martin coordinated a discussion to\u000a      generate draft guidelines concerning best interests decision-making for\u000a      patients with severe and enduring Anorexia Nervosa [all above EDSECT\u000a      impact corroborated by source 4]. In July 2013, EDSECT invited Prof Martin\u000a      to incorporate the results of the April meeting into a formal submission\u000a      to the House of Lords Select Committee on the Mental Capacity Act\u000a      [corroborating source 5]. This invitation will lead to further impacts\u000a      beyond the end of the REF impact period, both influencing the Royal\u000a      College of Psychiatrists in their submission of evidence, and potentially\u000a      influencing the Select Committee in their post-legislative scrutiny of the\u000a      Mental Capacity Act.\u000a    Given constraints of space, we include here just one example of feedback\u000a      received from public officials concerning the impact of the Essex work on\u000a      best interests:\u000a    Their small-scale public policy seminars have fostered frank and free\u000a      exchange of ideas across the usual professional divides, and have helped\u000a      explore and communicate important recent developments in the law that\u000a      governs social care. The `Green Paper Technical Reports' and `Seminar\u000a      Digests' available on their website provide valuable and accessible\u000a      analysis of key developments and dispute. For example, their document\u000a      `Deprivation of Liberty and DoLS' provides a useful analysis of early\u000a      reactions to the Court of Appeals ruling in Cheshire West and Chester\u000a      Council v P [2011] EWCA Civ 1257.

The\u000a      primary aim of medicine is to benefit patients; doctors and other\u000a      care-providers must therefore act in the best interests of\u000a      care-recipients. However, as soon as one moves beyond this intuitive and\u000a      universally agreed principle, problems arise both in theory and in\u000a      practice. In 2005, Parliament adopted The Mental Capacity Act\u000a      (MCA), a landmark piece of legislation that reshaped health-care and\u000a      social-care practice. Among other things the MCA created a new Court of\u000a      Protection for adjudication of disputes over best interests decisions\u000a      taken on behalf of care-recipients.\u000a    The Essex Autonomy Project (EAP) has studied the philosophical, ethical,\u000a      and legal problems that arise in the cases that have been brought before\u000a      the Court of Protection. Three problems in particular have loomed large in\u000a      recent legal controversies:\u000a    \u000a      To what extent can or should the assessment of the best interest of P\u000a        (the care-recipient) take into account the interests of others (e.g. P's\u000a        family, care-providers, etc.)?\u000a      When and under what circumstances does best interests decision-making\u000a        amount to an objectionably paternalistic intervention in the autonomy\u000a        rights of P?\u000a      Is best interests decision-making ever permissible, or is it always an\u000a        inadmissible restriction of P's autonomy?\u000a    \u000a    The EAP has made research contributions in connection with all three of\u000a      these challenges. In consultation with judges, lawyers, psychiatrists, and\u000a      social care professionals, they have produced a series of position papers\u000a      and research articles analysing the ethical and legal issues arising from\u000a      the application of the principle of best interests in health- and\u000a      social-care contexts:\u000a    \u000a      Szerletics traces the history and development of the best interests\u000a        standard in English case law and statute [1];\u000a      Szerletics and O'Shea analyse the controversies surrounding the\u000a        interpretation of `Deprivation of Liberty' in care-home settings [3];\u000a      Martin identifies an antinomial tension in English legal provisions\u000a        governing best interest assessments, and proposes a strategy for\u000a        resolving it [4];\u000a      Martin, Freyenhagen, Hall, O'Shea, Szerletics, Ashley diagnose and\u000a        criticise a trend towards hyperindividualism in guidance definitions of\u000a        `best interests' [5].\u000a    \u000a    Two critical results that have emerged in this research concern (a) the\u000a      importance of overcoming `zero-sum' models of the relationship between\u000a      paternalistic intervention and respect for autonomy and (b) the error in\u000a      defining `best interests' in narrowly individualistic terms that preclude\u000a      consideration of the interests of others. The cited body of research taken\u000a      together develops both a legal and an ethical argument in support of these\u000a      two negative points, and proposes alternative framings of the concept of\u000a      best interests that avoid them.\u000a    Essex Autonomy Project `Best Interests' researchers: Prof. Wayne\u000a      Martin (Professor in Philosophy from 2009, EAP Director 2010 - present);\u000a      Dr. Fabian Freyenhagen (Lecturer in Philosophy from 2009, Reader from\u000a      March 2012, EAP Co-Director 2010 - present); Dr. Tom O'Shea (EAP Senior\u000a      Research Officer 2010 - 2013); Antal Szerletics (EAP Senior Research\u000a      Officer 2010 - 2011).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43993","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    EAP research into mental capacity has had significant impact on the\u000d\u000a      conduct of capacity assessments in England and Wales. This has been\u000d\u000a      achieved by collaborating with NHS psychiatrists from the outset of the\u000d\u000a      project, building a network of partners who conduct capacity assessments,\u000d\u000a      and establishing a workforce training programme and Summer School,\u000d\u000a      supported by the EAP website and Virtual Learning Environment. This\u000d\u000a      training has been particularly effective at communicating the research\u000d\u000a      results concerning capacity assessments to police officers, social\u000d\u000a      workers, and health-care practitioners who conduct such assessments.\u000d\u000a    EAP's collaboration with practitioners began with a group of\u000d\u000a      psychiatrists in the NHS working on the implementation of the Mental\u000d\u000a        Capacity Act: Martin began research presentations at Maudsley\u000d\u000a      Hospital in 2007; both Martin and Freyenhagen were named Honorary\u000d\u000a      Researchers at the Maudsley in 2010; and from 2010 both Martin and\u000d\u000a      Freyenhagen have regularly participated in clinical interviews with\u000d\u000a      patients facing treatment decisions [corroborating source 1].

Examples include West Midlands Police trainers for the\u000d\u000a      assessment of mental capacity in police activities, and Brighton and Hove\u000d\u000a      Council trainers for social workers assessing the capacity of vulnerable\u000d\u000a      persons. Over the following months this range of contacts expanded\u000d\u000a      considerably to include Dr. John Adlam, who works with anorexia inpatients\u000d\u000a      at the Avalon Ward in London; John Leighton of Cambridgeshire County\u000d\u000a      Council, who was affiliated with the Social Care Institute of Excellence;\u000d\u000a      and solicitors and barristers at 39 Essex Street Chambers, who specialise\u000d\u000a      in mental health law.\u000d\u000a    Since 2010 this practitioner network has allowed the EAP to build a\u000d\u000a      training programme for professionals in psychiatry, social work, and\u000d\u000a      health care on issues pertaining to mental capacity. The training\u000d\u000a      programme communicates the main research findings to trainees for\u000d\u000a      practical application. This programme includes the Autonomy Summer School,\u000d\u000a      an annual three-day training course that equips frontline practitioners\u000d\u000a      with an understanding of the philosophical ideal of autonomy and provides\u000d\u000a      a forum for the discussion of the dilemmas surrounding its implementation.\u000d\u000a      The Summer School has been running since 2011 [the inaugural session\u000d\u000a      covered by The Guardian; see corroborating source 3] and has\u000d\u000a      attracted over &#163;15,000 in fees in the last two years.

Over 90% of delegates in 2012 rated the Summer School `very\u000d\u000a      useful' [corroborating source 4]; using a scale of 1 to 6, delegates'\u000d\u000a      levels of understanding before and after the training raised by an average\u000d\u000a      of 2.2 in 2013 [corroborating source 5]; and feedback comments have\u000d\u000a      included `your expertise is highly valuable to frontline practice', `some\u000d\u000a      new material presented here that I can integrate into practice' and `very\u000d\u000a      useful to think about for my practice' [corroborating source 5].\u000d\u000a    Since 2011 EAP has also offered a series on-site workforce training\u000d\u000a      modules for health and social care practitioners. These modules were\u000d\u000a      developed from the Autonomy Summer School syllabus and address the issues\u000d\u000a      faced by practitioners who conduct capacity assessments.

Adults who have the\u000d\u000a      capacity to decide for themselves (e.g. whether to accept or refuse\u000d\u000a      medical treatment) generally have a right to do so. But those who lack\u000d\u000a      capacity for a particular decision lose that right. This raises\u000d\u000a      theoretical, ethical and practical problems about the meaning of `mental\u000d\u000a      capacity': what is involved in `deciding for oneself'? and how should we\u000d\u000a      assess the ability of individuals to do so?\u000d\u000a    The Essex Autonomy Project (EAP) has made critical research contributions\u000d\u000a      in this area. EAP research on mental capacity and its assessment began\u000d\u000a      with collaborative work with the Institute of Psychiatry at the Maudsley,\u000d\u000a      part of the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust. Working with Dr Gareth\u000d\u000a      Owen (psychiatrist at the Maudsley), EAP researchers conducted a series of\u000d\u000a      qualitative studies of decision-making among psychiatric patients. This\u000d\u000a      collaboration led to a series of grants to develop the EAP. In 2010,\u000d\u000a      Martin and Freyenhagen were awarded a major AHRC grant to explore ethical,\u000d\u000a      legal, clinical and historical issues pertaining to the ideal of\u000d\u000a      self-determination in human affairs, with special attention to the\u000d\u000a      so-called `vocations of care' &#8212; health care, social care, eldercare,\u000d\u000a      childcare, etc. Also in 2010, Martin was appointed to assist on a Wellcome\u000d\u000a      Trust funded project, awarded to the Maudsley to use phenomenological\u000d\u000a      methods in clinical research into decision-making in three classes of\u000d\u000a      psychiatric patients.\u000d\u000a    In 2012, Martin was appointed to a second Wellcome Trust funded Maudsley\u000d\u000a      project, a longitudinal study of decision-making in patients with\u000d\u000a      fluctuating capacity. A third Wellcome Trust grant was awarded in 2012 to\u000d\u000a      Dr Penny Brown (Maudsley IoP and Broadmoor Hospital) to fund a\u000d\u000a      collaborative project with Martin that extends the EAP research paradigm\u000d\u000a      to criminal contexts involving Fitness to Plead. This research will run\u000d\u000a      from October 2013 to September 2017. To date the EAP has secured funding\u000d\u000a      of over &#163;460,000.\u000d\u000a    This research has produced a series of theoretical insights into the\u000d\u000a      phenomenon of mental capacity and its assessment. These insights have in\u000d\u000a      turn informed the EAP's collaborations with, and training of, front-line\u000d\u000a      practitioners. Among those theoretical insights are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Distributed Capacity and Decision Communities: Although traditional\u000d\u000a        methods of capacity assessment tend to focus on individual cognitive\u000d\u000a        capacity, decision-making capacity in vulnerable populations is often\u000d\u000a        distributed across relationships [2].\u000d\u000a      Temporal Capacity: The capacity to make decisions can be undermined by\u000d\u000a        forms of mental disorder that inhibit the patient's ability to project\u000d\u000a        themselves into significantly different futures. Although this temporal\u000d\u000a        capacity is not enumerated in the standard `four abilities' model for\u000d\u000a        mental capacity, it is a key variable in determining capacity, and a\u000d\u000a        factor to which assessors should be attentive [4].\u000d\u000a      Second-Person Phenomenology: A strategic combination of\u000d\u000a        phenomenological, hermeneutic, and psychiatric strategies can be used to\u000d\u000a        systematically explore and articulate the experience of `others' &#8212; in\u000d\u000a        particular the experiences of mentally disordered patients in navigating\u000d\u000a        decision-situations [4].\u000d\u000a      Transparency instead of Neutrality: Rather than risking uneven\u000d\u000a        practice and arbitrary value-imposition behind the smokescreen of\u000d\u000a        neutrality, the contested values at play in capacity assessments should\u000d\u000a        be made transparent and submitted to democratic oversight. Training\u000d\u000a        should become value-based and equip assessors to navigate the challenges\u000d\u000a        of value pluralism [3].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Essex Autonomy Project `Mental Capacity' researchers: Dr. Fabian\u000d\u000a      Freyenhagen (Lecturer in Philosophy from 2009, Reader from March 2012, EAP\u000d\u000a      Co-Director 2010 - present); Prof. Wayne Martin (Professor in Philosophy\u000d\u000a      from 2009, EAP Director 2010 - present); Vivienne Ashley (EAP\u000d\u000a      Post-Graduate Research Assistant 2010 - present).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44194","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    We have brought our work on aesthetics and its modern history to a wider\u000a      audience through a\u000a      diverse programme of public engagement activities, including gallery\u000a      events, `Cultural Days' and\u000a      6th form conferences and workshops.

Several of our\u000a      researchers are especially interested in considering contemporary issues\u000a      in aesthetics in relation\u000a      to themes and thinkers in its history; and it is our work in this area of\u000a      the discipline that underpins\u000a      the present case study. The research detailed here, undertaken by\u000a      Professors Alex Neill (at\u000a      Southampton since 1999) and Aaron Ridley (at Southampton since 1994), is\u000a      animated by the\u000a      conviction that contemporary aesthetics ignores its history at its peril.\u000a      Again and again, a topical\u000a      issue in the philosophy of art shows a new and richer side when brought\u000a      into dialogue with the\u000a      thought of earlier, sometimes quite unfashionable, philosophers. And it\u000a      does so, moreover, in\u000a      ways that have proved to be as stimulating to the non-academic publics\u000a      with whom we have\u000a      engaged as it is relevant to contemporary research in aesthetics.\u000a    Neill and Ridley have argued, for example, that contemporary approaches\u000a      to tragedy stand to gain\u000a      from the insights of Hume and Nietzsche (outputs 2 and 5 at section 3);\u000a      that recent accounts of\u000a      artistic expression require correction in the light of R.G.

Schopenhauer\u000d\u000a      sees life as a ghastly error that warrants resignation if not outright\u000d\u000a      despair, whereas Nietzsche regards it as something to be embraced and\u000d\u000a      affirmed &#8212; not in spite of the features that prompt Schopenhauer to\u000d\u000a      pessimism (for instance, that life is ineluctably filled with suffering\u000d\u000a      and loss), but at least partly in virtue of those features. And\u000d\u000a      this basic disagreement about global value, as it were, feeds in\u000d\u000a      fascinating ways into their distinctive approaches to a variety of more\u000d\u000a      local evaluative issues &#8212; concerning, for example, morality and religion &#8212;\u000d\u000a      that remain of relevance and importance to any thinking person today.\u000d\u000a    Recent research at the University of Southampton has been at the\u000d\u000a      forefront of broadening appreciation and understanding of these hugely\u000d\u000a      influential thinkers. The overarching aim has been to clarify how, for\u000d\u000a      both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, the question of the value of existence\u000d\u000a      arises and acquires urgency, and how, from their respective answers, other\u000d\u000a      questions, concerning, e.g., moral and religious value, radiate out. Few\u000d\u000a      institutions have contributed to this particular strand of investigation\u000d\u000a      more intensively or productively during the past decade.\u000d\u000a    The research referred to here began in 2004, and has been led by\u000d\u000a      Christopher Janaway (Professor of Philosophy at Southampton,\u000d\u000a      2004-present). Studies have been conducted partly through individual\u000d\u000a      scholarship (see section 3, below) and partly through collaborative\u000d\u000a      projects. The most significant of these latter have been `Schopenhauer's\u000d\u000a      Philosophy of Value', a series of events culminating in an international\u000d\u000a      conference held in Southampton in 2007 (the proceedings of which were\u000d\u000a      published, first, in the European Journal of Philosophy 16:2,\u000d\u000a      2008, and subsequently by Wiley-Blackwell); `Nietzsche and Modern Moral\u000d\u000a      Philosophy', a three year AHRC-funded research project (2007-10),\u000d\u000a      comprising three international conferences, nine international workshops\u000d\u000a      and nine public lectures (the proceedings of these events are being\u000d\u000a      published as a series of edited collections with Oxford University Press:\u000d\u000a      the first, Nietzsche, Naturalism and Normativity, C. Janaway and\u000d\u000a      S.

Their answers\u000d\u000a      are striking too; and in clarifying them, and in developing fresh\u000d\u000a      interpretations of, and responses to, them, we have amassed a body of\u000d\u000a      research that has lent itself very naturally to a programme of public\u000d\u000a      engagement activities. The key insight is that (and how) a fundamental\u000d\u000a      valuation of existence feeds into questions concerning other values, for\u000d\u000a      instance moral and religious value. The outputs listed in section 3\u000d\u000a      explore and articulate this insight from a variety of angles.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44278","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Cruft's evidence had significant impact on the theoretical underpinnings\u000d\u000a      of the Leveson report. The most considerable impact was on the sections in\u000d\u000a      which Lord Leveson outlines the principles which he takes to ground the\u000d\u000a      importance of a free press. In these sections (Vol. I, Part B, Chapter 2,\u000d\u000a      sections 3 and 4 (pp. 61-65)), Leveson gives significant weight to Cruft's\u000d\u000a      evidence, citing Cruft four times here and quoting a total of 21 lines\u000d\u000a      from his evidence. In conjunction with Onora O'Neill's evidence (cited\u000d\u000a      four times here, quoting a total of 10 lines) and that of Neil Manson and\u000d\u000a      Christopher Megone (two citations each) and Susan Mendus and Alan\u000d\u000a      Rusbridger (one citation each), Cruft's work on the value of a free press\u000d\u000a      is taken as a foundation for the report's approach to the value of a free\u000d\u000a      press.\u000d\u000a    Notably, the relevant sections of the report are organised in a way that\u000d\u000a      mirrors Cruft's evidence and reflects the central distinctions in his\u000d\u000a      research. The report's Ch. 2, section 3 (`The importance of a free press:\u000d\u000a      free communication') focuses on the non-instrumental value of freedom of\u000d\u000a      expression, citing and expounding Cruft's distinction between basic\u000d\u000a      personal rights to free expression that are individualistically justified\u000d\u000a      and non-instrumentally valuable, and the rights of press organisations\u000d\u000a      whose value is purely instrumental, and which cannot be\u000d\u000a      individualistically justified. Thus for example, section 3 ends with the\u000d\u000a      claim that `[t]he fundamental point is that unlike freedom of expression\u000d\u000a      for individuals, which has intrinsic merit as a form of self-expression,\u000d\u000a      press freedom [...] is largely understood as an instrumental good, to be\u000d\u000a      valued, promoted and protected to the extent that it is [...] to serve its\u000d\u000a      important democratic functions' (p. 63). Continuing the continuity with\u000d\u000a      Cruft's evidence, the report's section 4 (`The importance of a free press:\u000d\u000a      public debate and holding power to account') moves on to the instrumental\u000d\u000a      values of a free press, focusing on the two aspects - constraining power\u000d\u000a      and enabling democratic deliberation - highlighted in Cruft's testimony.\u000d\u000a      Later, the report's Chapter 3, section 2 (a section focused specifically\u000d\u000a      on the value of individual freedom of expression) approvingly cites\u000d\u000a      Cruft's notion of a non-instrumentally valuable liberal public sphere\u000d\u000a      constituted by certain rights (p. 71). Reference to Cruft's view of the\u000d\u000a      rights of media organisations as instrumentally and\u000d\u000a      non-individualistically grounded occurs again on p. 84 (Chapter 4, section\u000d\u000a      4 `Press ethics and the role of a code of ethics').\u000d\u000a    A related central aspect of Cruft's work that plays a significant part in\u000d\u000a      informing the Leveson report is Cruft's view on the relation between moral\u000d\u000a      duties, professional practice and regulation. For Cruft, the relation\u000d\u000a      between moral duties, law and regulation is complex; moral duties need not\u000d\u000a      and sometimes should not be enshrined in law or regulation (see (A) and\u000d\u000a      (F) above). In Chapter 4, sections 4.15 and 4.16, the report focuses on\u000d\u000a      what culture and practices would make a media industry recognisably\u000d\u000a      `ethical'. In 4.16, Lord Leveson quotes 18 lines from Cruft's evidence,\u000d\u000a      prefacing the quotation thus: `It is worth setting out extracts from some\u000d\u000a      of the answers to this question which appear to me to be particularly\u000d\u000a      illuminative'.\u000d\u000a    In his evidence to the Inquiry, Cruft drew inferences about the\u000d\u000a      particular requirements that his view of the grounding of competing rights\u000d\u000a      supports. He suggested that the instrumental grounding for a free press\u000d\u000a      was compatible with, and might often justify, requiring proprietors,\u000d\u000a      editors and journalists to declare their financial and political\u000d\u000a      interests, and to report payments made or received for publishing a story.\u000d\u000a      This suggestion is cited in the report, Part K (`Regulatory Models for the\u000d\u000a      Future'), section 8.15 (on the contents of a code of practice for the\u000d\u000a      press), p. 1684.\u000d\u000a    In addition to its impact on Lord Leveson's report &#8212; and in particular,\u000d\u000a      its foundational role in the conception of the value of a free press and\u000d\u000a      freedom of expression grounding the report &#8212; Cruft's work on the nature\u000d\u000a      and grounds of different rights also received a wider public airing\u000d\u000a      through his participation in the Inquiry. The written and spoken evidence\u000d\u000a      is in the public sphere, available online on the Inquiry website; Cruft's\u000d\u000a      spoken evidence was also podcast live on http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/,\u000d\u000a      where a recording of the session is still available. As a result, Cruft's\u000d\u000a      evidence was discussed by interested members of the public in online fora\u000d\u000a      and in several comments (c. 20) on twitter. Cruft also gave a follow-up\u000d\u000a      talk to students and members of the public in Stirling, outlining the\u000d\u000a      position he expounded for the Inquiry.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Rowan Cruft's work on how a right's moral importance reflects the nature\u000d\u000a      of its grounds had a significant impact on Lord Leveson's report, in\u000d\u000a      particular on the principles which Leveson takes to ground a free press.\u000d\u000a      Cruft was an expert witness at the Inquiry, and his evidence is cited (pp.\u000d\u000a      62- 4, 71, 84, 88, 1684), forming a major part of the report's theoretical\u000d\u000a      underpinnings.

His work focuses\u000d\u000a      both on what rights are and on what we can learn about the relative\u000d\u000a      importance of different rights by examining their grounds. See (A) and (F)\u000d\u000a      in the references below for Cruft's work on the former topic; for the\u000d\u000a      latter, see (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E). In his written evidence, Cruft\u000d\u000a      addressed eleven questions put to him by the Leveson Inquiry: questions on\u000d\u000a      the nature of the public interest in a free press and in freedom of\u000d\u000a      expression, and on conflicts between these and other values including\u000d\u000a      privacy and security. Further questions concerned the ethical duties of\u000d\u000a      the press, and appropriate methods for enforcing such duties. Cruft\u000d\u000a      answered these questions in 4,500 words of written and 45 minutes of\u000d\u000a      spoken evidence. Here, Cruft brought his research on the nature and\u000d\u000a      grounding of rights to bear on the rights of the press and of individual\u000d\u000a      freedom of expression.\u000d\u000a    Three ideas developed by Cruft came to the fore in his Inquiry evidence.\u000d\u000a      First, Cruft has argued that, as well as being useful means for fostering\u000d\u000a      and upholding valuable relationships, rights and their correlative duties\u000d\u000a      sometimes partially constitute such relationships (see (B) and (D)). The\u000d\u000a      notion of the liberal public sphere as constituted by rights &#8212; a guiding\u000d\u000a      theme of Cruft's evidence to the Inquiry - rests on this view that rights\u000d\u000a      can constitute relationships.\u000d\u000a    Secondly, Cruft's work distinguishes between rights that are valuable\u000d\u000a      independently of their effects and rights whose value depends on their\u000d\u000a      usefulness. An example of the former, Cruft argues, is the moral right not\u000d\u000a      to be enslaved: this right is held by all persons and benefits a person\u000d\u000a      even in a slave-holding society in which the right goes unrecognised, for\u000d\u000a      it is (in a sense explained in (B)) better to be a slave who is wronged by\u000d\u000a      one's enslavement (even if nobody recognises this) than to be a slave who\u000d\u000a      lacks the moral status of a wrongable being. By contrast, Cruft argues\u000d\u000a      that most property rights are purely instrumentally valuable ((C) and\u000d\u000a      (E)). Kamm and Nagel offer cognate views on the non-instrumental value of\u000d\u000a      basic rights, but they fail to note that many rights &#8212; including those of\u000d\u000a      ownership and other morally justified socially created rights &#8212; are purely\u000d\u000a      instrumentally valuable. In his evidence, Cruft used this distinction to\u000d\u000a      differentiate individual liberal rights, some of which are\u000d\u000a      non-instrumentally valuable, from the rights of media organisations, whose\u000d\u000a      role is purely instrumental.\u000d\u000a    Thirdly, building on Raz's work, Cruft has argued that certain rights\u000d\u000a      (e.g. to freedom of expression, or against slavery) are grounded\u000d\u000a      individualistically by what they do for their holders, while others (e.g.\u000d\u000a      property rights, parents' rights to child benefit payments) are grounded\u000d\u000a      in what they do for people other than the right-holder, such as third\u000d\u000a      parties or the wider community (see all six references below, especially\u000d\u000a      (A), (E) and (F)). This played an important part in Cruft's Inquiry\u000d\u000a      evidence, underpinning his claims that the rights of media organisations\u000d\u000a      are not justified by what they do for such organisations but only by their\u000d\u000a      benefits to the wider public, while in contrast some individual rights of\u000d\u000a      expression and privacy are justified independently of whether they serve\u000d\u000a      beings other than the right-holder.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44280","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    SmartData is a project of the Office of the Information and Privacy\u000d\u000a      Commissioner of Ontario (IPC), in collaboration with the Identity,\u000d\u000a      Privacy, and Security Institute of the University of Toronto (IPSI). IPSI\u000d\u000a      is the home of the encryption specialist Dr. George Tomko who originally\u000d\u000a      conceived the technical dimension of SmartData. IPC is an agent of the\u000d\u000a      provincial legislature of Ontario that acts \"to uphold and promote open\u000d\u000a      government and the protection of personal privacy in Ontario\"\u000d\u000a      (corroborating source B). One of IPC's flagship policies is `privacy by\u000d\u000a      design', as proposed by Ann Cavoukian, the Information and Privacy\u000d\u000a      Commissioner of Ontario, and endorsed by the International Data Protection\u000d\u000a      and Privacy Commissioners meeting in Jerusalem in October 2010. As\u000d\u000a      Cavoukian puts it, \"[p]rivacy can no longer be assured solely by\u000d\u000a      compliance with regulatory frameworks; rather, privacy assurance must come\u000d\u000a      from designing privacy protection right into technology, business\u000d\u000a      practices and physical design\" (corroborating source C).\u000d\u000a    Against this background, the goal of SmartData is to develop Web-based\u000d\u000a      autonomous agents that will act as an individual's online surrogate,\u000d\u000a      securely storing their personal information (e.g. financial details,\u000d\u000a      information regarding medical conditions and treatment), and intelligently\u000d\u000a      disclosing that information with appropriate sensitivity to the context of\u000d\u000a      any data request. The vision is one of protecting\/reclaiming individual\u000d\u000a      informational privacy in an age of increasing worries about the ways in\u000d\u000a      which businesses, governments and criminal organizations may access and\u000d\u000a      control online personal information. The model for SmartData is\u000d\u000a      evolutionary computation and embodied cognition within a dynamical systems\u000d\u000a      framework. It is built on an optimism that, using this model, it will be\u000d\u000a      possible to artificially evolve online agents that are capable of\u000d\u000a      disclosing personal information in a context-sensitive fashion. The human\u000d\u000a      beings for which these virtual agents are online surrogates will need only\u000d\u000a      to set up the initial conditions for data release contexts and then inform\u000d\u000a      the agent should these conditions alter. Decisions regarding data release\u000d\u000a      will then be made by the agent through its autonomous context-sensitive\u000d\u000a      application of these conditions. Cavoukian has described SmartData as \"an\u000d\u000a      innovation that is desperately needed because without it, our data will\u000d\u000a      move beyond our reach and our ability to ultimately maintain control\"\u000d\u000a      (corroborating source D).\u000d\u000a    The initial phase of the impact described here was direct but unplanned.\u000d\u000a      As Michelle Chibba, the IPC's Director of Policy and Special Projects, put\u000d\u000a      it \"[Wheeler's] book \"Reconstructing the Cognitive World\"... was the\u000d\u000a      inspiration for the Smart Data vision\" (email of 27 October\u000d\u000a      2011; see corroborating sources E, F). The SmartData model combines\u000d\u000a      embodied cognition, evolutionary robotics and a dynamical systems approach\u000d\u000a      to intelligence. This was precisely the set of ideas that was explored and\u000d\u000a      developed, in a distinctive way, in Wheeler's Reconstructing the\u000d\u000a        Cognitive World. The book also focussed on context-sensitivity in\u000d\u000a      intelligence, and on the role of the set of ideas just mentioned in\u000d\u000a      showing us how the capacity for such sensitivity may be mechanized.\u000d\u000a    The second phase of the impact involved a planned intervention. Wheeler\u000d\u000a      was invited by IPC to take part in the IPSI SmartData International\u000d\u000a      Symposium (`Privacy meets Evolutionary Robotics: Protecting our Freedoms\u000d\u000a      with Virtual Tools', Toronto, May 2012). This symposium refined SmartData\u000d\u000a      by bringing together academics, members of IPC (including the\u000d\u000a      Commissioner) and experts from the computer and Web industries (e.g. a\u000d\u000a      senior researcher from IBM's Blue Gene supercomputing project).\u000d\u000a      Representatives from Google and Facebook, plus privacy stakeholders in the\u000d\u000a      public sector, were present. Wheeler gave two presentations (Philosophical\u000d\u000a      Reflections on the Design of Autonomous Agents: the Problem of Relevance'\u000d\u000a      and `What Matters: Real Bodies and Virtual Worlds') in which he applied\u000d\u000a      arguments and insights from the research described above to SmartData. He\u000d\u000a      also took part in a 4 hour closed meeting which brought together selected\u000d\u000a      invited speakers, the local SmartData team, and representatives from IPSI\u000d\u000a      and IPC, to shape the future of the project. Wheeler was asked to submit a\u000d\u000a      paper to the symposium proceedings, published by Springer in their\u000d\u000a      `Security and Cryptology' series (publication 6). This allowed his\u000d\u000a      experience at the symposium to influence his research, demonstrating a\u000d\u000a      mutually profitable interaction between impact and research. (The\u000d\u000a      corroborating sources for this paragraph are detailed in G.)\u000d\u000a    IPC subsequently invited Wheeler to be a named collaborator on a major\u000d\u000a      grant application (1 million Canadian dollars) made via IPSI to the\u000d\u000a      University of Toronto's 2013 Connaught Global Challenges Fund Award. This\u000d\u000a      award aims to support a project that \"focus[ses] intently on a leading\u000d\u000a      global challenge of the 21st century\" (corroborating source H). SmartData\u000d\u000a      was one of three shortlisted applications (corroborating source H).\u000d\u000a      Although the bid was ultimately unsuccessful, IPC has been encouraged to\u000d\u000a      submit to the 2014 competition. In addition, in 2012, Wheeler drew on the\u000d\u000a      research described above to contribute to the design of a proof-of-concept\u000d\u000a      SmartData study, a mobile phone application for ordering books online, in\u000d\u000a      which a spoken request such as \"Buy me a paperback copy of X, lowest\u000d\u000a      price, delivery time unimportant\" will be carried out (including seller\u000d\u000a      credibility checks and payment) by an application that adapts over time to\u000d\u000a      user preferences. This study will test the SmartData concept, set a\u000d\u000a      baseline, and gain further insights into the theoretical and technical\u000d\u000a      issues.

IPC is an agent of\u000d\u000a      the Ontario legislature that acts to uphold and promote the protection of\u000d\u000a      personal privacy. The goal of SmartData is to enhance personal data\u000d\u000a      privacy on the Web, by developing Internet-based agents that act as online\u000d\u000a      surrogates for individuals, securely storing and intelligently disclosing\u000d\u000a      personal information as required.

He was promoted to Reader (2006) and then to Professor (2009).\u000d\u000a      Over this period, he has produced a widely discussed series of research\u000d\u000a      publications on the complex ways in which mind, body and world are\u000d\u000a      causally and constitutively inter-related. This work on so-called 4E\u000d\u000a      (embodied-embedded-extended-enactive) cognition includes a much cited\u000d\u000a      monograph, Reconstructing the Cognitive World (2005) and over 25\u000d\u000a      subsequent publications in peer-review journals and edited collections.\u000d\u000a    Reconstructing the Cognitive World, which is the principal source\u000d\u000a      of the opening phase of the impact described below, was completed\u000d\u000a      following Wheeler's appointment at Stirling and published by MIT Press in\u000d\u000a      2005. The book draws on sources as seemingly disparate as phenomenology,\u000d\u000a      evolutionary robotics and dynamical systems theory, in order to articulate\u000d\u000a      and defend a non-standard philosophical framework for cognitive science. Reconstructing\u000a        the Cognitive World explores a number of interconnected themes that\u000d\u000a      Wheeler has continued to investigate in subsequent research. This later\u000d\u000a      research has resulted in &#8212; and, in a manner to be described below, has\u000d\u000a      sometimes been carried out in interaction with &#8212; the second phase of the\u000d\u000a      impact described here. Two longstanding themes in particular should be\u000d\u000a      highlighted: (a) the challenges that confront the attempt to explain, in\u000d\u000a      purely mechanistic terms, the remarkable but routine capacity of human\u000d\u000a      intelligence to be fluidly and flexibly sensitive to what is relevant in\u000d\u000a      context (a question which is intertwined with that of replicating such a\u000d\u000a      capacity via artificial intelligence &#8212; AI) and (b) the ways in which, and\u000d\u000a      the extent to which, human thought and reasoning are determined by\u000d\u000a      features of our physical embodiment (a question which immediately raises\u000d\u000a      issues regarding the possibility of creating disembodied &#8212; e.g. online &#8212;\u000d\u000a      surrogates for our own decision-making).\u000d\u000a    With regard to (a), Wheeler has argued as follows (publications 1, 2, 3,\u000d\u000a      5, 6): there are in fact two problems of relevance, the first\u000d\u000a      concerns how a purely mechanistic system might achieve appropriate,\u000d\u000a      flexible and fluid action within a context, while the second concerns how\u000d\u000a      a purely mechanistic system might achieve appropriate, flexible and fluid\u000d\u000a      action in worlds in which adaptation to new contexts is open-ended and in\u000d\u000a      which the number of potential contexts is indeterminate; although a\u000d\u000a      potential solution to the first of these problems exists (in terms of\u000d\u000a      special-purpose, brain-body-environment couplings), our scientific\u000d\u000a      understanding of the second remains radically incomplete. With regard to\u000d\u000a      (b), Wheeler has argued as follows (publications 4, 6): although the role\u000d\u000a      of physical embodiment in intelligent human action has been\u000d\u000a      under-appreciated in most philosophy and cognitive science, what really\u000d\u000a      matters about that embodiment is adequately captured by a view according\u000d\u000a      to which the body is conceptualized as a material realizer of functionally\u000d\u000a      specified cognitive architectures; so the temptations of a more radical\u000d\u000a      (anti-virtuality) embodied position, according to which specific bodily\u000d\u000a      acts and structures make some nonsubstitutable contribution to thought and\u000d\u000a      reason, should be resisted. One outcome of this research is that Wheeler\u000d\u000a      now has a reputation as a philosopher whose work is highly relevant to the\u000d\u000a      understanding and future development of our online presence (see\u000d\u000a      corroborating source A).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44491","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Embodied and Narrative Practices Framework led to impacts in a range\u000a      of situations.\u000a    A. Improved clinical practice in early detection and treatment of\u000a        schizophrenia by motivating a revision in the Examination of Anomalous\u000a        Self-Experience (EASE) diagnostic tool.\u000a    EASE is a questionnaire used in phenomenological interviews. In its\u000a      original format, EASE focused on individual self-experience and hence\u000a      underappreciated and underemphasised intersubjective aspects &#8212; such as\u000a      difficulties in interpersonal rapport, communication, and emotional and\u000a      cognitive reactions to others. Revisions were made in both content and\u000a      method. Questions were added to focus on interpersonal dimensions, and\u000a      both interviewees and interviewers were filmed, making it possible to\u000a      analyse interactions between them.\u000a    Gallagher and Hutto's research had a direct influence on noticing and\u000a      correcting these limitations. The relevant changes in practice were\u000a      facilitated through work of the Marie Curie Disorders and Coherence of the\u000a      Embodied Self (DISCOS) Training Network (2007-2011), a consortium of nine\u000a      European centres of excellence in neuroscience, philosophy, psychology and\u000a      psychiatry. Twelve psychiatrists and psychologists in this project trained\u000a      with the revised EASE and interviewed over eighty patients, leading to the\u000a      recognition of thirty hitherto undiagnosed cases of early schizophrenia.\u000a      Eight of these patients went on to receive appropriate treatments in\u000a      Heidelberg.\u000a    Professor Thomas Fuchs, Principal Investigator of DISCOS, acknowledged\u000a      that thorough acquaintance with Gallagher and Hutto's framework became\u000a      part of the `necessary theoretical background' for those involved in\u000a      DISCOS. Three clinical sub-projects of DISCOS &#8212; one each in Heidelberg and\u000a      Copenhagen on the embodied self in schizophrenia, and one in Munich on\u000a      somatoform disorders &#8212; took particular advantage of it. A manual for the\u000a      diagnostic tool, including an introduction to the Embodied and Narrative\u000a      Practices Framework, is in press.\u000a    B. Influenced the use of alternative therapeutic approaches to\u000a        schizophrenia by clinicians in the UK\u000a    Clinicians of the Coventry and Warwickshire Early Intervention Team used\u000a      Gallagher and Hutto's insights into embodied, enactive and narrative\u000a      social cognition as an important theoretical impetus in modifying their\u000a      approach to early psychotic illness. The research helped them to develop\u000a      narrative-based strategies that decreased the occurrence of schizophrenic\u000a      episodes in some patients. It enabled them to better understand the\u000a      importance of the role of the social environment in the early stages of\u000a      psychosis. This led to modified strategies that successfully enabled these\u000a      clinicians to meet both their Department of Health caseload targets\u000a      (fifty-five clients per year) and the national target for the duration of\u000a      untreated psychosis of three months. The Early Intervention team focused\u000a      on subjects aged 14-35 presenting their first episode of psychotic\u000a      illness, typically schizophrenia. The narrative-based strategies provided\u000a      clinicians with an understanding of patients' `delusional realities' and\u000a      fostered patients' notions of self-worth and autonomy. Dr Matthew Broome\u000a      (NHS Team) became acquainted with the work of Gallagher and Hutto through\u000a      their mutual involvement in the AHRC `Feelings and Emotions in Psychiatric\u000a      Illness' Network (2009-10).\u000a    C. Shaped the formulation of new methodological guidelines for the\u000a        clinical evaluation of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and monitoring of\u000a        treatment\u000a    These guidelines, developed at the Bambino Ges&#250; Ospedale Pediatrico, Rome\u000a      (one of the largest children's hospitals in Europe), direct clinicians to\u000a      focus on early social practices by analysing bodily movement and the\u000a      development of gesture. Researchers and clinicians, using Gallagher and\u000a      Hutto's innovative view of intersubjective understanding, began to focus\u000a      on early signs of sensorimotor problems and problems with pointing and\u000a      gesture in children with autism spectrum disorders, instead of relying on\u000a      standard `theory of mind' measures. From 2010 this enabled the development\u000a      of a taxonomy for evaluating different options for specific treatment\u000a      strategies. This was done at the hospital's Child Neuropsychology Unit,\u000a      where, on average, sixteen new ASD patients are evaluated per month and\u000a      twenty-four ASD patients are treated per month. This impact was\u000a      facilitated by the work of Dr Laura Sparaci (Bambino Ges&#250;), who studied as\u000a      a Fulbright Fellow with Gallagher and as a Visiting Researcher at the\u000a      University of Hertfordshire with Hutto in 2007-8. She also participated in\u000a      the ESF-funded conference in 2007 and the summer school in 2008. She\u000a      explored the use of the new approach to social cognition in diagnosing ASD\u000a      in a 2008 publication.\u000a    D. Influenced other treatments of ASD\u000a    Dr Belmonte, then in the Faculty of Human Development at Cornell\u000a      University and a Senior Research Associate of the Autism Research Centre,\u000a      Cambridge, used the Narrative Practice Hypothesis as a theoretical\u000a      grounding for a research project that was top-ranked by the US National\u000a      Science Foundation in 2008. This led to new therapies for children with\u000a      severe autism to learn to convey information by training in the basic\u000a      sequencing of actions. An initial clinical study in 2008, involving nine\u000a      children in a therapeutic environment, yielded positive results &#8212; children\u000a      who underwent the training increased the complexity of their communicative\u000a      output; larger follow-ups are planned.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    New avenues for diagnosis and treatment in a variety of psychotherapeutic\u000a      settings were influenced by Hutto and Gallagher's innovative approach to\u000a      social cognition, improving the quality of life of individuals.

It focuses on situated\u000a      interactions and social practices rather than mechanisms in individual\u000a      minds\/brains. It defends the view that most of our everyday social\u000a      engagements and modes of understanding have different bases and functions\u000a      than supposed by the standard cognitivist framework. For example, the\u000a      latter typically assumes that understanding other minds requires the\u000a      manipulation of mental representations in theoretically based inferences\u000a      and\/or simulation.\u000a    Gallagher and Hutto developed their joint framework in publications,\u000a      since 2003, building on each other's work. This culminated in a joint\u000a      position paper describing their new framework in 2008 (see references in\u000a      section 3 below), after Gallagher joined the Department of Philosophy at\u000a      the University of Hertfordshire in 2007. Drawing on phenomenology,\u000a      Gallagher developed a distinctive, embodied approach to social cognition\u000a      and philosophy of mind. With Hutto he considered evidence from\u000a      developmental psychology and neuroscience, arguing that embodied practices\u000a      of social interaction (posture, movement, gesture, facial expression,\u000a      vocal intonation, etc.) support our skills for detecting and dealing with\u000a      the purposeful intentions of others. Rather than attributing mental\u000a      states, individuals cope in such interactions by perceiving and responding\u000a      to the expressive attitudes of others situated in particular pragmatic and\u000a      social contexts. This embodied practice approach directly challenges the\u000a      overly mentalistic explanations of these phenomena found in `theory of\u000a      mind' accounts in philosophy, psychology and cognitive science.\u000a    Drawing on analytic philosophy, Hutto added to this framework, developing\u000a      the `Narrative Practice Hypothesis', which holds that even our most\u000a      sophisticated language-based ways of making sense of ourselves and others\u000a      are grounded in socio-cultural practices. Hutto's hypothesis, defended by\u000a      philosophical arguments informed by empirical findings, promoted the idea\u000a      that our everyday ability to make sense of actions in terms of reasons is\u000a      developed by and takes the form of engaging in a distinctive kind of\u000a      narrative practice, involving stories about protagonists who act for\u000a      reasons. With Gallagher, he argued that these high-level folk\u000a      psychological capacities can be explained without the need to posit the\u000a      existence of any kind of inherited `theory of mind' devices.\u000a    Gallagher and Hutto discussed how this core research might be applied in\u000a      psychology in the main publications that articulate the Embodied and\u000a      Narrative Practices framework.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44492","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2960313","Name":"Luxembourg"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, Floridi has been engaged in several high-impact projects at\u000d\u000a      the crossroads of philosophy, computer science, information science, and\u000d\u000a      information and communication technologies. The impact has occurred\u000d\u000a      outside academia in two areas: 1) fostering the critical understanding of\u000d\u000a      ICT-related phenomena among ICT companies; and 2) shaping policy agendas\u000d\u000a      at European and UN level on the ethical foundation for advanced\u000d\u000a      information societies.\u000d\u000a    ICT and Commerce\u000d\u000a    Sogeti is an international information technology consultancy with global\u000d\u000a      reach, connecting 20,000 professionals in 15 countries. The director of\u000d\u000a      its Research Institute for Analysis of New Technologies (VINT) reports\u000d\u000a      that Floridi's contribution to the `The App Effect' (2011) and `Big Data'\u000d\u000a      (2012) projects greatly assisted understandings of how modern information\u000d\u000a      technologies shape society, culture and business, and that his ideas fed\u000d\u000a      into the strategies of European and American organisations.\u000d\u000a    Sogeti further recognises that his work on the philosophy and ethics of\u000d\u000a      information, in addressing questions of how government and commerce should\u000d\u000a      strategise their responses to rapid technological change, has `influenced\u000d\u000a      the influencers', to the extent that members of the International\u000d\u000a      Executive Council (a community of CEOs and CIOs of 80 companies worldwide)\u000d\u000a      approach ICT challenges differently. Specifically, the director pinpoints\u000d\u000a      the effect of Floridi's work on 1) a group of 350 technology leaders\u000d\u000a      working in various industries across Belgium and Luxembourg; and 2) the\u000d\u000a      VINT\/New Technologies community in the Netherlands, which consists of 900\u000d\u000a      technology leaders. His insights allowed these two groups to consider how\u000d\u000a      technology changes organisational environments, and they have consequently\u000d\u000a      been able to place their activities and research on a firm theoretical\u000d\u000a      basis.\u000d\u000a    ICT and Public Policy\u000d\u000a    The following examples outline the influence on public policy of\u000d\u000a      Floridi's information ethics research.\u000d\u000a    EU Policy Makers: The Onlife Initiative\u000d\u000a    In 2011, Floridi was asked by the European Commission's\u000d\u000a      Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology to\u000d\u000a      chair a thirteen-member group on `Concept Re-engineering: The Onlife\u000d\u000a      Experience'. This group was one element of the EU's Digital Futures\u000d\u000a      initiative, which sought to anticipate issues and generate ideas for\u000d\u000a      policy making in the digital realm. The group formally presented its\u000d\u000a      report, `The Onlife Manifesto: Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era', in\u000d\u000a      Brussels on 8 February 2013, and has since taken the Onlife Initiative\u000d\u000a      discussion to other centres and events in Greece, France, Italy, Canada,\u000d\u000a      Holland and Portugal.\u000d\u000a    The report, which discusses how `the deployment of information and\u000d\u000a      communication technologies (ICTs) and their uptake by society affect\u000d\u000a      radically the human condition, insofar as it modifies our relationships to\u000d\u000a      ourselves, to others and to the world' (Sect. 5, Ref. 4, p. 2), is also a\u000d\u000a      critical element in implementing `Horizon2020'. According to the European\u000d\u000a      Commission's website, Horizon2020 is `a Europe 2020 flagship initiative\u000d\u000a      aimed at securing Europe's global competitiveness. Running from 2014 to\u000d\u000a      2020 . . . [this] new programme for research and innovation is part of the\u000d\u000a      drive to create new growth and jobs in Europe.'\u000d\u000a    European Centre for International Political Economy\u000d\u000a    From late 2011, Floridi began informing the work of the European Centre\u000d\u000a      for International Political Economy (ECIPE), a research institute on\u000d\u000a      international economy and global trade. ECIPE's director has said that,\u000d\u000a      prior to working with Floridi, there had been no consideration given to\u000d\u000a      connections between political economy and ethics, but that his\u000d\u000a      organisation had since begun looking at the ethical evaluation of\u000d\u000a      international trade agreements on Intellectual Property Rights. In the\u000d\u000a      context of the Anti-Counterfeit Trade Agreement (ACTA), `the framework and\u000d\u000a      contributions by Floridi has been accepted by all disciplines, political\u000d\u000a      groupings and interests, and thereby contributing towards discussion on a\u000d\u000a      future model for internet and enforcement of intellectual property between\u000d\u000a      previously irreconcilable parties'. He also said that, overall, Floridi's\u000d\u000a      research `is leading to a reorientation in the broader sphere of our\u000d\u000a      understanding of the impact of ICT on market regulation and assessment of\u000d\u000a      international agreements. This will have repercussions for political,\u000d\u000a      social and economic interventions for a range of ICT-related issues, in\u000d\u000a      which we face new difficulties or simply unprecedented novelties.'\u000d\u000a    UNESCO Policy Makers\u000d\u000a    Working with UNESCO's intergovernmental Information for All Programme\u000d\u000a      (IFAP), Floridi made a substantial contribution to UNESCO's draft Code of\u000d\u000a      Ethics for the Information Society (2010) (Ref. 6, p. 2), which was\u000d\u000a      concerned with ensuring equitable access to information. The proposed code\u000d\u000a      was debated at UNESCO's 36th General Conference in 2011, with member\u000d\u000a      states suggesting that the document be referred to as `guidelines' or a\u000d\u000a      `set of principles' (Ref. 7, p. 2). Ultimately, the draft code was used as\u000d\u000a      the basis of an action plan, adopted by the Executive Board in November\u000d\u000a      2012, to address ethical issues surrounding the information society (Ref.\u000d\u000a      8).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Between 2010 and 2012, Professor Luciano Floridi transferred knowledge\u000d\u000a      about epistemological issues in the philosophy of information to Sogeti,\u000d\u000a      an international information technology consultancy; and, via Sogeti, to\u000d\u000a      technology and business leaders in Europe and beyond, influencing their\u000d\u000a      planning for and adaptation to technological change.

It has brought enormous\u000d\u000a      benefits and opportunities, but also greatly outpaced our understanding of\u000d\u000a      its foundations and consequences, and raised conceptual issues that are\u000d\u000a      rapidly expanding, evolving, and becoming increasingly serious. Philosophy\u000d\u000a      faces the challenge of providing a foundational treatment of the concepts\u000d\u000a      and phenomena underlying the information revolution, in order to foster\u000d\u000a      our understanding and guide the responsible construction of our\u000d\u000a      information society.\u000d\u000a    This challenge is met by the philosophy of information, which\u000d\u000a      investigates the conceptual nature and basic principles of information,\u000d\u000a      including its ethical consequences. It is a thriving new area of research,\u000d\u000a      at the crossroads of epistemology, metaphysics, logic, philosophy of\u000d\u000a      science, semantics, and ethics, and Floridi has worked on developing it as\u000d\u000a      an independent area of research since the late 1990s. The general view\u000d\u000a      orienting his work is that information is a concept as fundamental and\u000d\u000a      important as truth, meaning, knowledge, Being, and so equally worthy of\u000d\u000a      autonomous, philosophical investigation. However, despite its importance,\u000d\u000a      our understanding of `information' is comparatively impoverished.\u000d\u000a    Floridi's research on the nature, dynamics, and uses of information has\u000d\u000a      led to a quadrilogy entitled The Foundations of the Philosophy of\u000d\u000a        Information. The first two volumes, on the philosophy and the ethics\u000d\u000a      of information respectively, were published in 2011 and 2013.\u000d\u000a    Specific research with external partners has also fed into the impacts\u000d\u000a      described in section 4. This has revolved around fostering the critical\u000d\u000a      understanding of ICT-related phenomena among ICT companies, especially\u000d\u000a      Sogeti (an international information technology consultancy) and Google.\u000d\u000a    Sogeti\/VINT\u000d\u000a    In 2011 and 2012 two projects, `The App Effect' and `Big Data', involved\u000d\u000a      collaboration with an international team of technology and behavioural\u000d\u000a      experts at the Global Research Institute for the Analysis of New\u000d\u000a      Technologies (VINT), founded by Sogeti. The main finding arising from `The\u000d\u000a      App Effect' was the identification of new media addiction and the blurring\u000d\u000a      of any distinction between information-related behaviour and regular\u000d\u000a      behaviour as two major behavioural changes that will have a profound\u000d\u000a      effect on the way organisations need to operate. The `Big Data' project\u000d\u000a      resulted in analysis of data discovery as the next phase of business\u000d\u000a      intelligence, seen as a combination of heuristics in business operations\u000d\u000a      combined with a significantly better performance through information\u000d\u000a      management (interactive visualisation, exploration, planning and\u000d\u000a      execution). These two projects led to further research, currently on the\u000d\u000a      social impact of the `Internet of Things'.\u000d\u000a    Google\u000d\u000a    Floridi's knowledge transfer project `Information Quality Standards and\u000d\u000a      their Challenges' began in December 2011 (scheduled to complete in\u000d\u000a      November 2013). Google's interest lay in achieving a precise understanding\u000d\u000a      of information quality standards, and constructing a conceptual framework\u000d\u000a      for analysing and evaluating these standards. Overall, the project aimed\u000d\u000a      to help Google identify and engineer information systems that balance the\u000d\u000a      benefit of high information quality with the cost of providing it.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44528","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impacts include the entry of precautionary recommendations into EC\u000d\u000a      coordinating action outcomes and right to know initiatives into\u000d\u000a      international nanotechnology standardisation.

He raised this in his 2006 co-edited book and at a UNESCO workshop\u000d\u000a      in Paris (2007), leading directly to an invitation from Dr Peter Hatto of\u000d\u000a      BSI (UK standardisation body) to lead a world-first initiative on\u000d\u000a      nano-labelling.

The aim is to generate multidisciplinary awareness and\u000d\u000a      investigation of the ethical implications of nanoscale complexity and\u000d\u000a      uncertainty in order to influence risk policy and the labelling of\u000d\u000a      consumer nanoproducts.

A reductionist and mechanistic\u000d\u000a      paradigm still predominates in technology development, which hampers\u000d\u000a      understanding of a very high and complex level of interactivity and\u000d\u000a      reactivity, the generation of unpredictable emergent properties, some of\u000d\u000a      which defy conventional means of characterisation and measurement, and\u000d\u000a      hence generating unprecedented degrees of uncertainty, especially\u000d\u000a      regarding safety and toxicity. There is an urgent need for a regulatory\u000d\u000a      and testing regime beyond the conventional one.

Altorf has organised Socratic dialogues on such topics as\u000d\u000a      `What is learning?', `Why should you respect someone's autonomy?', `What\u000d\u000a      is my responsibility to my community?', etc. Most dialogues are held at\u000d\u000a      St. Mary's University College and are open to the general public. She has\u000d\u000a      also facilitated dialogues in Amsterdam and Berlin. Participants have\u000d\u000a      included lawyers, artists, and teachers.\u000d\u000a    Evidence of impact has been gathered in the form of spoken and written\u000d\u000a      feedback. This feedback confirms the findings of the research. People who\u000d\u000a      experience the method for the first time affirm that participating in a\u000d\u000a      dialogue is a new experience to them, incomparable to anything and\u000d\u000a      impossible to learn in any other way than by participating. Many mention\u000d\u000a      the new insight that it is possible to entertain diverging views. Thus,\u000d\u000a      people are surprised that `hugely different approaches were able to find\u000d\u000a      common ground to work from', or that `people were able to listen to one\u000d\u000a      another and not argue'. People also comment on the fact that it was not\u000d\u000a      necessary to find an answer (`outcome') to the philosophical question\u000d\u000a      posed. They question the use of experience, and understand that each\u000d\u000a      dialogue is different, and that this kind of dialogue cannot be\u000d\u000a      standardised into a product. It should be noted that Socratic Dialogues\u000d\u000a      are being `sold' to companies. The practice is not without controversy.\u000d\u000a      (See for instance J. Kessels (1997). Socrates op de markt: Filosofie in\u000d\u000a      bedrijf. Amsterdam: Boom). The feedback thus suggests that as a direct\u000d\u000a      result of participating in a Socratic Dialogue participants acquire\u000d\u000a      awareness of a new way of dialogue, that challenges the limitations of a\u000d\u000a      model of argument based on competition and result. The potential for\u000d\u000a      conflict resolution is a topic of future research, and possibly impact.\u000d\u000a      Interest is also expressed in the method. At the end of every dialogue, as\u000d\u000a      well as at selected moments throughout the dialogues, participants will\u000d\u000a      engage in a meta-dialogue, which considers not the content, but the nature\u000d\u000a      of the dialogue. Questionnaire questions include: `What did you like best\u000d\u000a      about the day?', `What surprised you?', etc. as well as open ended\u000d\u000a      questions for any further comments.\u000d\u000a    Because of the requirements of the dialogue, numbers are limited.\u000d\u000a      Dialogues have been held on the following dates: November 2010\u000d\u000a      (afternoon), March 2011 (day long dialogue), September 2012 (two day\u000d\u000a      dialogue), June 2013 (day long dialogue). In addition, dialogues have been\u000d\u000a      facilitated at other locations on request: Amsterdam (March 2012), Berlin\u000d\u000a      (July 2013). The method has also been used in the undergraduate module\u000d\u000a      `Philosophy in Schools and the Community' at St. Mary's University\u000d\u000a      College. The topic of the module concerns philosophy with children, where\u000d\u000a      students were taught to teach philosophy to primary school children and to\u000d\u000a      reflect on this practice. Thus, ideas from this research were brought to\u000d\u000a      the school yard. This module ran for the first time in Spring 2013, in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with the Philosophy Foundation.\u000d\u000a    The reach of the impact has been widened by presenting findings orally\u000d\u000a      and in written form. Presentations were given in Glasgow (2012, by\u000d\u000a      invitation) at a conference of the Public Philosophy Network in Washington\u000d\u000a      (2011), at the last conference of the Subject Centre for Philosophical and\u000d\u000a      Religious Studies (2011), at the Joint Session (2011), and the London\u000d\u000a      Conference in Critical Thought (2013). The written presentations are\u000d\u000a      listed above as Altorf (2011b) and Altorf (2013). Findings have also been\u000d\u000a      presented in non-academic resources such as an open web resource (M.\u000d\u000a      Altorf (2011), `Socrates, Apologie'.

This includes\u000d\u000a      analysis of the prominent use of thought experiments (Altorf, 2005), as\u000d\u000a      well as reflections on the idiosyncratic writing style of Iris Murdoch and\u000d\u000a      the biographies and status of women in philosophy (Altorf, 2008 and\u000d\u000a      Altorf, 2011a).\u000d\u000a    The above research inspired two pedagogical projects, both funded via a\u000d\u000a      rigorous selection process by the Subject Centre for Philosophical and\u000d\u000a      Religious Studies (HEA). The first of these projects, `Dialogue as a\u000d\u000a      Written Form of Assessment' (2009-2010) examined the possibilities of the\u000d\u000a      use of written dialogue as a form of assessment in an undergraduate\u000d\u000a      philosophy degree. This project went beyond the initial remit and included\u000d\u000a      reflections on the growing marketisation of higher education.\u000d\u000a    The second project, `Socratic Dialogue in Education' (2010-2011) pursued\u000d\u000a      the issue of marketisation further. It started from the supposition that a\u000d\u000a      Socratic Dialogue in the Nelson-Heckmann tradition would offer both a\u000d\u000a      space and a means to reflect on the position of philosophy in higher\u000d\u000a      education that resists the prevailing use of terms like `delivery',\u000d\u000a      consumer', etc. It also argued that resistance should come from practice\u000d\u000a      and not just theoretical reflection. This second project resulted in a\u000d\u000a      publication in peer reviewed journal (Altorf, 2013), as well as a report\u000d\u000a      (Altorf, 2011b), which is freely available from academia.edu.\u000d\u000a    While Altorf (2013) concluded the research within the REF assessment\u000d\u000a      period, the project continues. Further publications are planned (with C.\u000d\u000a      Monahan, `Philosophical Dialogue and Persuasion: Rewriting the Gorgias',\u000d\u000a      to be submitted in December 2013, and Altorf, `Thinking as an Act of\u000d\u000a      Resistance: Arendt and the Practice of Socratic Dialogue', to be submitted\u000d\u000a      in 2014) as well as the development of a web resource on philosophical\u000d\u000a      dialogue and rhetoric\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/philosophicaldialogueandrhetoric.wordpress.com\/\u000d\u000a    As the resources cited suggest, the key researcher of this case study is\u000d\u000a      Altorf, who joined St Mary's in 2005 as the Programme Director of\u000d\u000a      Philosophy.

It does so through `thinking in\u000d\u000a        questions' (Van Rossem 2011), through `philosophising instead of doing\u000d\u000a        philosophy' (Nelson 1927), and in its emphasis on experience. It\u000d\u000a        resists, for instance, the omnipresent need for `outcomes', and it\u000d\u000a        allows disagreement to exist without immediately positing a discourse of\u000d\u000a        winners and losers.\u000d\u000a      Socratic Dialogue offers a means of teaching philosophising, rather\u000d\u000a        than learning about philosophers. There is a specific need for this kind\u000d\u000a        of learning in the present circumstances, and not just at universities.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "}]

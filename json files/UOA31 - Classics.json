[{"CaseStudyId":"936","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aLaurence has sought to develop impact both from research on artefacts undertaken at Kent and,\u000d\u000aspecifically, from his own research on Roman history and archaeology. This work has been\u000d\u000aundertaken both to enhance the depth of public engagement in Canterbury, via its museums, and\u000d\u000ato extend the reach of the research to a much wider public via animated, free-to-view films on the\u000d\u000ainternet. The result is impact on museum policy and impact that has created a better public\u000d\u000aunderstanding of the experience of childhood in the city of Rome, as well as a greater engagement\u000d\u000awith Roman history.\u000d\u000aThe Significance of the Impact: The Roman Museum in Canterbury\u000d\u000aThe route to achieving this impact needs to be set out to understand how the impact was\u000d\u000adeveloped and the nature of the impact over the course of more than three years. It was initiated\u000d\u000aby Canterbury City Council (CCC) taking the decision on 18 February 2010 to propose the closure\u000d\u000aof the Canterbury Roman Museum on grounds of budget priorities from the start of the following\u000d\u000afinancial year (April 2011 - see 5.1 below). The Vice-Chancellor, Dame Julia Goodfellow, had\u000d\u000awritten to the Leader of the Council, John Gilbey, to establish meetings to be held in April 2010. At\u000d\u000athese meetings, the significance of the Roman past in Canterbury, and the relevance of research\u000d\u000aon artefacts undertaken at the University, was set out by Laurence and Swift. That significance had\u000d\u000anot been previously understood, as reported in the Independent newspaper (08\/02\/10, 5.2 below).\u000d\u000aThis achieved a 12-month breathing space in which to explain the value and significance of the\u000d\u000aRoman Museum with reference to research, and to develop research based on the museum and\u000d\u000aits collection to demonstrate that value (3.3 above).\u000d\u000aThe first opportunity to present this research and to influence museum policy came in May 2010. A\u000d\u000aLight Touch Peer Review was undertaken by the Museums, Libraries and Archives (MLA) Council,\u000d\u000aat which Laurence explained the importance of involvement of University research in\u000d\u000aunderstanding the significance of the museum. These discussions and the report (5.3 below) led\u000d\u000athe council to ask Laurence to undertake a study of museum governance, and to chair the new\u000d\u000astakeholder group: Canterbury Heritage Partnership (with representatives from the Cathedral,\u000d\u000aCanterbury Archaeological Trust, Canterbury Christ Church University, Kent County Council, CCC,\u000d\u000aand a number of Friends Groups of the 5 museums under CCC governance). By Autumn 2010\u000d\u000aLaurence had established The Heritage and Innovation Network at Kent (THINK) to connect\u000d\u000aUniversity research with museums in Kent and to establish a mechanism to engage all\u000d\u000astakeholders. As of 31 July 2013, THINK had 122 members, 20% of whom are academics, 80%\u000d\u000aexternal to HE, with significant numbers of museum professionals (14%), local government officers\u000d\u000a(7%), researchers (11%), as well as entrepreneurs, consultants and creative artists.\u000d\u000aThe Heritage Partnership provided a new platform to discuss ideas for museum development and\u000d\u000ato influence the policy that all six museums in Canterbury and its district should remain open. That\u000d\u000adecision came in Spring 2011. Related to this, a new post of Director of Museums was created with\u000d\u000aLaurence included on the CCC appointment panel (May 2011). This demonstrates his impact on\u000d\u000athe council and, in particular, the value given to his views by the Head of Culture and Enterprise at\u000d\u000aCCC. After the appointment of the new Director, Laurence had regular six-weekly meetings to\u000d\u000adiscuss the role of the Roman Museum, drawing on his research (including 3.3). Through his\u000d\u000aresearch findings he created a better understanding of the value of the collection and initiated a\u000d\u000adiscussion of ways to promote it that resulted in a significant increase in visitor numbers between\u000d\u000a2009 and 2013 (see 5.7 below). It was through this dialogue that Laurence contributed to the\u000d\u000adevelopment of a clear vision for the Roman Museum and to the decision to begin its\u000d\u000arefurbishment in spring 2013 (5.7 below).\u000d\u000aTo ensure that his research in relation to the Roman Museum (3.3 above) has an impact on the\u000d\u000apublic, Laurence has delivered lectures and a gallery talk with a podcast (5.4 below), and has\u000d\u000awritten a newspaper article in the Canterbury Times (24\/05\/13; circulation 55,000 residents - 5.5).\u000d\u000aThe link with his research on graffiti and children in Pompeii (3.5 above) was highlighted to the\u000d\u000aFriends of Canterbury Museums (30 people) with hands-on discussion of inscriptions from the\u000d\u000amuseum collection in the light of his research on epitaphs (3.4 and 3.6 above). He has organised,\u000d\u000ain 2013, for key objects from the museum to be recorded with the Department's 3D laser scanner\u000d\u000aand to be presented on a digital screen in the Roman Museum to highlight the research being\u000d\u000aundertaken at the University. These activities have placed his research on childhood in the public\u000d\u000adomain: it has been delivered by the local newspaper to every household (55,000); it has been\u000d\u000amade available on the internet; and it has been embedded in a local museum.\u000d\u000aThe shift in museum policy from one of museum closures, including the Roman Museum, to one of\u000d\u000acommitment can be demonstrated in CCC's corporate plan 2011-16, as well as with reference to\u000d\u000athe July 2013 discussion of budget cuts. The Roman Museum is now (July 2013) seen as being of\u000d\u000asignificant value and will not have its opening hours reduced, unlike 3 other museums managed by\u000d\u000aCCC. Since 2010, when the Roman Museum was seen as having little significance, less than\u000d\u000aChristmas lights (as reported in the Independent 08\/02\/10 - see 5.2 below), and as a result of\u000d\u000aLaurence's activities, this view has been reversed (Canterbury Times 17\/07\/13). Reasons given for\u000d\u000athis have been that the Roman Museum now has a clearer focus or `offer for visitors' and a strong\u000d\u000aeducation programme. Laurence's research has made a significant contribution to establishing a\u000d\u000abetter understanding of the cultural value of the collection on display to the public in the Roman\u000d\u000aMuseum, and this has informed the policy decision in July 2013 to retain the Roman Museum (5.7\u000d\u000abelow).\u000d\u000aExtending the Reach of the Impact: Digital Content for the Internet\u000d\u000aAs a result of the discussion concerning the Roman Museum, Laurence was invited to join\u000d\u000aCanterbury for Culture (a stakeholder group that established Canterbury's Culture Awards).\u000d\u000aThrough its Chair (Tim Le Lean) knowledge of his research spread to Cognitive Media, a Small-Medium Enterprise (SME), including the production of animations with educational content for the\u000d\u000aUS free-to-view network TED-Ed (5.8 below). In 2012, a meeting was held between Andrew Park\u000d\u000a(founder of Cognitive Media) and Ray Laurence to establish a short, content-led, animated film for\u000d\u000aTED-Ed (5.8 below). Laurence created the script based on his research for a 6-minute animated\u000d\u000afilm `A Glimpse of Teenage Life in Ancient Rome' and advised on the visual content developed by\u000d\u000aCognitive Media (based particularly on research in 3.2, 3.4, 3.6 above). The film was released on\u000d\u000a29 October 2012. The impact of the film can be measured via YouTube statistics to 31 July 2013\u000d\u000a(5.9 below). It has reached 222,415 people, and there has been a very positive engagement with\u000d\u000athe film (2,092 likes and 68 dislikes) and more than 360 comments discussing the content. It has\u000d\u000abeen shared with others 248 times (5.9 below). The comments on YouTube highlight how the\u000d\u000acontent was found to be `really informative and relatable', and to create a demand for a second film\u000d\u000aor, as the comments stated, `part 2' (5.9 and 5.10 below). Importantly, the film has been\u000d\u000aincorporated into 239 webpages to create customised lessons for schools, through a process\u000d\u000aknown as flipping from the TED-Ed site (5.8 and 5.9 below). The film was shortlisted for the 2013 Canterbury Culture Award for Commercial Collaboration. The success of the first film led TED-Ed\u000d\u000ato commission Laurence to write scripts for a Rome series, as they say `we're thrilled with these\u000d\u000aexceptional lessons, and we think they add something unique and useful to the library of lessons\u000d\u000awe offer teachers around the world' (5.8 below). As a result, and again working with Cognitive\u000d\u000aMedia, a second film, `Four Sisters in Ancient Rome', was released on 14 May 2013 (based on\u000d\u000aresearch in 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6). Within 24 hours of its release 10,000 people viewed it and by the\u000d\u000aend of the first week 26,000 people had seen the film (886 likes and 44 dislikes). In 11 weeks from\u000d\u000arelease (to 31 July 2013), 39,204 people had watched `Four Sisters in Ancient Rome', and the film\u000d\u000ahad been shared with others 130 times. To quote some of the 98 comments to highlight the impact:\u000d\u000a`This was really informative and relatable. I want to see part 2'; `this is the best way of learning'; `so\u000d\u000aentertaining and informative'; `I love that they go into detail of the girls' lives. Textbooks rarely do\u000d\u000athat'; and `I love these animations. It makes history even more interesting!' (5.10 below).\u000d\u000aComments also raised queries that were answered with reference to the films; for example: `I think\u000d\u000ayou will find your answer at 5:28' (i.e. 5 minutes and 28 seconds into the film). Further films will be\u000d\u000aproduced for release in 2014 and 2015 in this series and result from the uptake by 220,000 users\u000d\u000aof the internet, sharing by internet users (376 times), use by school teachers via flipping (276\u000d\u000atimes) and numerous comments asking for additional programmes &#8212; for example: `this was\u000d\u000aincredible, please make more like this' (5.10 below). As TED-Ed comment, these are `compelling\u000d\u000alessons of an incredible caliber', and, as Andrew Park of Cognitive Media comments (5.8 below),\u000d\u000athis activity `fulfils TED-Ed's philosophy of a set of ideas that have changed viewers' attitudes to\u000d\u000ahow they see Rome'.\u000d\u000aReach and Significance\u000d\u000aLaurence has ensured that his research on Roman history has reached over 260,000 viewings in\u000d\u000athe course of the 9 months from October 2012 to 31 July 2013. Since his arrival at Kent, he has\u000d\u000aensured that the value of research relevant to the Canterbury Roman Museum has been explained\u000d\u000awithin a process of advocacy that has contributed to a policy that has retained this museum, and\u000d\u000acontributed to the decision to begin its refurbishment and renewal.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aDrawing on his research on Roman history, in particular on the Roman family, Ray Laurence has\u000d\u000ahad a major impact on museum policy in Canterbury as well as raising public awareness of Roman\u000d\u000aculture and society for an international audience. Following a proposal by Canterbury City Council\u000d\u000ain February 2010 to close the Canterbury Roman Museum, Laurence initiated a response based\u000d\u000aon research within the Department which demonstrated the potential for the Roman Museum to\u000d\u000aengage with visitors in new ways. This led to the Council not only reversing its decision to close the\u000d\u000aMuseum, but also making it one of the priority sites for its future museums policy. Working with\u000d\u000aother staff in his Department, Laurence has since developed new digital content for the museum as\u000d\u000apart of this strategy. In addition, Laurence has worked with Cognitive Media to produce two short\u000d\u000aanimated films on the Roman family which received around 260,000 viewings in a 9-month period\u000d\u000afrom the launch of the first film on 29 October 2012 until 31 July 2013. This has led to the leading\u000d\u000awebsite TED-Ed.com commissioning Laurence to produce further films on Roman life, and to the\u000d\u000aextensive circulation of his current films through TED-Ed.com as a classroom resource by\u000d\u000ateachers.\u000d\u000a","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000aUniversity of Kent\u000d\u000a","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Kent (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Kent","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007150}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3170335","Name":"Pompei"},{"GeoNamesId":"3169070","Name":"Rome"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a\u000a1.

This is underpinned by the database of 23,000 epitaphs developed as\u000d\u000apart of his Leverhulme-funded project on `Age and Imperialism' that was completed in the second\u000d\u000ahalf of 2010. The subsequent analysis is being written up for publication, including a chapter on the\u000d\u000afamily. The preliminary findings were published at the end of 2012, providing new statistical\u000d\u000ainsights into how children of certain ages (e.g. three-year-olds) were more likely to be\u000d\u000acommemorated (see below, 3.4). This new project led Laurence to examine how museums with\u000d\u000aepigraphic collections presented them to the public. In particular, he examined how the Roman\u000d\u000aMuseum in Canterbury included and excluded people from the past. A major finding of the case\u000d\u000astudy of the Canterbury Roman Museum was that there was an exclusion of positive roles for\u000d\u000awomen and children, and that when they did appear in museum presentations they were\u000d\u000adisconnected from a concept of the family &#8212; a target audience for the museum sector (published in\u000d\u000aLaurence output 4: Roman Archaeology for Historians, 2012, especially ch. 12).\u000d\u000aIn developing this research and its impact, Laurence drew on work by Swift (developed whilst at\u000d\u000aKent over the last decade), and specifically her most recent book on artefacts (Style and Function\u000d\u000ain Roman Decoration &#8212; Swift output 1) to re-interpret Dea Nutrix figurines. In addition, with Sears\u000d\u000a(Birmingham), Peter Keegan (Macquarie, Australia) and Garraffoni (Federal University of Parana,\u000d\u000aBrazil), from 2011 he set out to pull together work on Written Space in the Latin West (Bloomsbury,\u000d\u000a2013), including his own understanding of children in public space in Pompeii, identified via a\u000d\u000amapping of alphabets scratched into wall plaster. The completion of the editing of chapters of the\u000d\u000abook Rome, Ostia, Pompeii: Movement and Space (Laurence output 3) led him to develop his view\u000d\u000aof how movement and, in particular, stopping at monuments created a rhythm to the ancient city.\u000d\u000aAs a result of his research on children in public space in the Roman city, Laurence has established\u000d\u000aboth the need to develop a history of the city that includes children (40-50% of the population), and\u000d\u000athat modern museums should incorporate children and families, a group recognised in museum\u000d\u000amarketing, into their presentation of the Roman past.\u000d\u000aLaurence's post at Kent commenced on 1 April 2010; Swift has been at Kent since September\u000d\u000a2000.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"947","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aKyriakidis's approach to public archaeology has not just had an impact in the locality of his field\u000d\u000aproject in Crete, but has established a clear pathway for impact at a national level in Greece. This\u000d\u000ahas involved using the experience of impact on the local villagers of Gonies, the archaeological\u000d\u000aservice in Crete, and the local government authorities in Crete, and scaling up from this context to\u000d\u000acreate a national programme for Greece via the establishment of the Initiative for Heritage\u000d\u000aConservancy (IHC), a charity which has recently extended its reach beyond the state borders of\u000d\u000aGreece.\u000d\u000aThe approach to impact can be seen most clearly in the establishment of activities associated with\u000d\u000athe Cultural Foundation of Gonies. Building on the research project associated with the Minoan\u000d\u000aPeak Sanctuaries site, a public engagement programme was founded by Kyriakidis (see 5.3 below\u000d\u000afor details). This programme informed the citizens of Gonies of the cultural values of the heritage\u000d\u000aand, in addition, engaged their own daily lives with those values and the heritage management of\u000d\u000athe site. As a result, `the citizens are much better informed, they understand both the value of\u000d\u000aheritage and the importance to protect it', and the `project opened up new avenues and has\u000d\u000aactivated the members of the village, prodding them to do more for what they did not recognise\u000d\u000apreviously as valuable' (5.3 below). This approach transformed the villagers' approach to heritage\u000d\u000aand ensured that the approach continued after the project via the activities of the cultural\u000d\u000afoundation: `we now have organised several events around the heritage of the village' (5.3 below).\u000d\u000aAt the heart of the success of this initiative was the connection between the cultural values of the\u000d\u000avillagers, including stone masonry techniques, and the heritage management of the nearby\u000d\u000aarchaeological sites (5.3 below). As a project, this transformed the engagement of the citizens of\u000d\u000aGonies with the heritage sites (`they now care more than they did before') and added to the cultural\u000d\u000alife of the village.\u000d\u000aOn the basis of his local impact in Gonies, Kyriakidis embarked on an initiative to scale up from the\u000d\u000alevel of a village to influence national policy-makers. He did this with a view to providing training\u000d\u000abased on his research that developed the conception of understanding competing values\u000d\u000aassociated with heritage sites and heritage management to the everyday life of a community. This\u000d\u000amove involved the establishment of a charity, the Initiative for Heritage Conservancy (IHC),\u000d\u000abased in the municipality of Elefsina, which includes the heritage site of Eleusis. As a result of the\u000d\u000aactivities of the IHC in training heritage professionals and future professionals at Elefsina, the site\u000d\u000aof Eleusis has gained precise data that can be used to assess changes in the nature of\u000d\u000aconservation of the site and to develop conservation strategies from the 3D laser-scanned data\u000d\u000aand its visualisation. As a result, Eleusis now has one of the best digital maps in Greece, which will\u000d\u000ainform heritage management strategies. Regular re-scanning of the site will highlight conservation\u000d\u000aissues. Grey-literature confidential reports on the nature of conservation and a risk assessment\u000d\u000areport have provided the site with key information from which to develop visitor strategies and\u000d\u000apriorities for conservation. Working with the Heritage Management students, Kyriakidis created the\u000d\u000adraft management plan for the site of Eleusis. In keeping with Kyriakidis's experience in Gonies, he\u000d\u000aengaged local stakeholders in the project, running local public engagement activities: open\u000d\u000ainformation events for the community. At the same time, he sought to establish international\u000d\u000apartnerships that would cause Elefsina to become a hub for heritage management. This\u000d\u000acombination of local archaeological authorities, the local community, and international partners has\u000d\u000abenefited the site, not least in a 30% increase in visitor numbers.\u000d\u000aThe scaling up of impact from a local to a national level took Kyriakidis to the Greek Ministry of\u000d\u000aCulture. In 2010, the IHC was recognised as a unique organisation bridging the gaps between the\u000d\u000apublic sector, the private sector and the university sector by the Minister of Culture, who\u000d\u000aadditionally placed the IHC under the `auspices' of the Ministry (5.4). This close relationship has\u000d\u000aestablished the IHC as a key NGO (Non-Government-Organisation) involved in the continuing\u000d\u000aprofessional development of the Ministry's staff (8 have taken, or are taking, our MA programme in\u000d\u000aHeritage Management), and roughly two-thirds of the 3000 people who attended the 100+ IHC\u000d\u000alectures and seminars on Heritage Management are employed at the Ministry of Culture. Together\u000d\u000awith the Ministry, the IHC has co-organised events on the coordination of protocols for databases\u000d\u000athroughout Greece, and also on the use of digital technologies and on other heritage management\u000d\u000aissues. The link between the Ministry-IHC and the joint MA Programme in Heritage Management\u000d\u000ahas provided benefit to the Ministry in the development of the management plan for the sites of\u000d\u000aancient Olympia and Kyparissia.\u000d\u000aThe scaling up of Kyriakidis's impact to influence the management of heritage at a national level\u000d\u000aled him to approach the then Rector of the Athens University of Economics and Business\u000d\u000a(AUEB). This university specialised almost exclusively in finance, economics and MBA provision.\u000d\u000aKyriakidis described his approach to heritage management at Gonies to the Rector (Prof.\u000d\u000aPrastacos), alongside his plans for the IHC and for activities at Eleusis. As Prof. Prastacos\u000d\u000acomments: `I quickly realised that this approach would help with a lot of the issues surrounding\u000d\u000asustainability of heritage conservation and heritage management in Greece and the world [...]. I\u000d\u000acould sense that AUEB, being the leading Business School in SE Europe, should be part of this\u000d\u000aeffort since heritage as we all know is vital to tourism, education, culture and development' (5.2\u000d\u000abelow). The significance of this impact is that AUEB, a Business School, shifted its position from\u000d\u000aexclusively finance-based education to engage with the research of Kyriakidis in the discipline of\u000d\u000aarchaeology; he thus influenced the shape of Higher Education in Greece. The joint AUEB-Kent\u000d\u000aMA in Heritage Management ensures that impact is delivered through its students, who `undertake\u000d\u000amarket-led collaborative projects in heritage management, helping organisations internationally to\u000d\u000atake their work further and thus creating international impact' (5.2 below). In addition, one-third of\u000d\u000athe students on the programme `are already working as heritage managers', and undertaking the\u000d\u000aMA ensures their professional training (5.2 below). The significance of the programme is evidenced\u000d\u000aby the financial support it has received (over &#163;200,000) from the following foundations: Niarchos,\u000d\u000aFulbright, Bodossaki, Canellopoulos, and Leventis; and by an article in the Financial Times in 2011\u000d\u000a(5.1 below).\u000d\u000aThe second means of scaling up the impact of this approach to heritage management can be seen\u000d\u000ain the interaction with the Intergovernmental Organisation for the Protection of Monuments\u000d\u000a(ICCROM), established by UNESCO. ICCROM's Director General (Dr Bouchenaki) conducted a\u000d\u000athree-day visit to review the IHC's programme. He found that Kyriakidis's impact was `transforming\u000d\u000aresearch into education', `filled a gap in Greece' and was `turning education into action' through a\u000d\u000aclearly devised strategy and reasoning that could make a clear difference in Greece and the\u000d\u000aEastern Mediterranean'. Unusually for an organisation so recently set up, the IHC became a\u000d\u000apartner of ICCROM, because the IHC was a transparent organisation and was capable of making a\u000d\u000adifference in the area of heritage management (5.5 below). Drawing on discussions with\u000d\u000aBouchenaki, Kyriakidis pursued with the IHC three areas related to his research: 1) digitisation as a\u000d\u000atool for conservation; 2) the effect of the macro-environment, including climate change, on\u000d\u000amonuments; and 3) the promotion of archaeological sites as tourist destinations. These three areas\u000d\u000ahave been delivered via a series of measures that ensure that the impact of Kyriakidis's research\u000d\u000ahas significant reach and significance in the training and understanding of Heritage professionals.\u000d\u000aThe work of Kyriakidis in Crete to explain the value of the Minoan Peak Sanctuaries in terms of\u000d\u000apublic archaeology has led him to develop 3D laser-scanning, digitisation and visualisation as an\u000d\u000aunderpinning technology for heritage management (5.6 and 5.10 below). The concept of value as\u000d\u000athe essential element appealed to hardware and software companies in Athens: Leica\u000d\u000aGeosystems, Rapidform, Alice-Labs and Metrica. This has resulted in direct involvement of staff\u000d\u000afrom these companies in the summer training courses on a pro bono basis. Their involvement is an\u000d\u000aoutcome of Kyriakidis's research, and their involvement with the IHC programmes is on-going and\u000d\u000alikely to be a regular feature of training in Heritage Management and 3D recording at Eleusis after\u000d\u000aREF2014. The IHC has run annual 4-week summer courses in collaboration with the Centre for\u000d\u000aApplied Spatial Technology (University of Arkansas) to provide training and professional\u000d\u000adevelopment in 3D recording and visualisation. An ICCROM- and IHC-led conference held at the\u000d\u000aAcropolis Museum in 2012 set out to provide a new venue in Greece for the discussion of climate\u000d\u000achange (a subject focused on in Kyriakidis's research in Crete). This activity resulted in Kyriakidis's\u000d\u000aappointment by the Bank of Greece to the National Committee for Climate Change (Greece) in\u000d\u000a2012. As a result of founding the IHC and running its activities, Kyriakidis has established himself\u000d\u000ain a relatively short period of time (2010-13) as an authority on Heritage Management in Greece &#8212;\u000d\u000athis being underpinned by the impact of his research. The letters of support demonstrate the on-going impact of his research on policy-makers in relation to heritage management. His approach to\u000d\u000apublic archaeology in Crete and the training of staff employed by the Greek Ministry of Culture\u000d\u000ahave led to Kyriakidis being included in the ICCROM 2012 inspection of the site of Pompeii. The\u000d\u000ainspection flagged the absence of a programme of public archaeology, and, as a result, in 2013 the\u000d\u000aItalian Ministry of Culture, in association of the Municipality of Pompeii, launched a programme of\u000d\u000apublic engagement via crowd-sourcing to pull in `99 ideas for Pompeii' (5.7-5.9 below).\u000d\u000aOver the REF period, Kyriakidis has scaled up an approach to heritage management in Gonies\u000d\u000a(Crete) via the establishment of an NGO (the IHC) that has worked closely with (and under the\u000d\u000aauspices of) the Greek Ministry of Culture to train staff and to develop heritage management\u000d\u000astrategies at Eleusis, and now Olympia and Kyparissia. In so doing, he has influenced an HEI\u000d\u000a(AUEB) to shift its focus from exclusively finance to include heritage management in its provision,\u000d\u000aand to collaborate directly with an international organisation (ICCROM) in the development of\u000d\u000astrategies of public engagement and in the study of the effects of climate change in the heritage\u000d\u000asector. As a result, his research that developed a new, more inclusive and contextual approach to\u000d\u000aheritage management in Gonies has become a model for the sustaining of heritage sites in Greece\u000d\u000awith the reach extending internationally via ICCROM to Pompeii.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aKyriakidis's research has had impact on policy-makers within both national and local government.\u000d\u000aThis has involved a scaling up of his impact activities that were based in Gonies (Crete) to include\u000d\u000aboth national policy-makers and international organisations. As a result, he has become an\u000d\u000ainfluential international authority on the development of greater public engagement with heritage\u000d\u000asites (including Pompeii), and on public policy in Greece. His research has resulted in a shift in\u000d\u000apolicy at the Athens University of Economics and Business, which now engages with the provision\u000d\u000aof training in Heritage Management and is branching out from exclusively finance-based education.\u000d\u000aHis CPD (Continuing Professional Development) courses have reached out to the commercial\u000d\u000asector (particularly Leica).\u000d\u000a","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000aUniversity of Kent\u000d\u000a","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Kent (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Kent","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007150}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"262752","Name":"Elefsína"},{"GeoNamesId":"4099753","Name":"Arkansas"},{"GeoNamesId":"6697802","Name":"Crete"},{"GeoNamesId":"264371","Name":"Athens"},{"GeoNamesId":"3170335","Name":"Pompei"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a\u000a1) Kyriakidis, E.

In\u000d\u000athis work, he set out the role of various stakeholders and the use of the archaeology of ritual, not\u000d\u000aleast within tourism, to capture the various values and their contexts associated with a particular\u000d\u000aarchaeological site. He followed up on this publication with a practical application built into his\u000d\u000afieldwork on Minoan Peak Sanctuaries from his season in 2009. The project included an\u000d\u000aethnographic study of the village of Gonies. This study had a double aim: (i) to find out more about\u000d\u000athe ways the landscape intersects with life in the present and the recent past, and (ii) to create a\u000d\u000agreater awareness and empowerment mechanism that would help the local community to integrate\u000d\u000aits everyday activity and its own priorities with those associated with heritage and heritage\u000d\u000amanagement. This ethnographic survey and the academic study of ritual were interwoven with the\u000d\u000acore of heritage management issues associated with the Minoan Peak Sanctuaries. As a result,\u000d\u000athe project engaged with the competing narratives created by different groups of users of the sites,\u000d\u000aand evaluated the feelings of conflicting ownership and cultural meanings found amongst the\u000d\u000avarious stakeholders. Building on this knowledge, a better understanding of the range of values\u000d\u000aassociated with heritage sites was developed.\u000d\u000aKyriakidis's research sets out a need to consider a core set of heritage values with regard to any\u000d\u000asite: what an archaeological site stands for. He argues that these values should be the guide to\u000d\u000aany intervention, conservation programme, and use of that site. This includes the development of\u000d\u000athe perception of sites through virtual reality that has at its basis 3D laser scanning to record the\u000d\u000astate of conservation with precision. Heritage management, Kyriakidis argues, needs to focus\u000d\u000aattention as much on the development of these values as on the conservation of the site. This\u000d\u000aapproach contrasts with the existing focus of heritage managers on the fabric of a site, without\u000d\u000aexploring and protecting the cultural value that the site might have.\u000d\u000aKyriakidis's published research, his fieldwork-based research in Gonies (Crete), and his activities\u000d\u000ain Elefsina have demonstrated that values associated with heritage sites tend to be personal,\u000d\u000avested, time-related and often contradictory. The value attributed to a site, such as ancient Eleusis,\u000d\u000awill be quite different for local industrialists (economic), when compared to the values of heritage\u000d\u000amanagers (mystical, religious). The values of a heritage site have been shown by Kyriakidis to\u000d\u000achange over time and with environmental change. This is shown most clearly in the discussion of\u000d\u000ahis work on the Minoan Peak Sanctuaries that was presented at the Heritage and Climate Change\u000d\u000aconference held at the Acropolis Museum in 2012.\u000d\u000aKyriakidis joined the University of Kent in 2004.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"3703","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The significant cultural and pedagogical impact of increased\u000a      understanding of history derives from Oxford research involving the\u000a      decoding of ancient writing. It is Bowman's research on the Vindolanda\u000a      tablets that has been most important in making the history of the Roman\u000a      frontier in Britain come alive in a new way for a modern audience. This\u000a      has had a particularly strong local impact at Vindolanda itself (below).\u000a      Bowman and Tomlin's re-reading of the Frisian tablet had local impact in\u000a      the Netherlands, contributing to understanding of the slipperiness of\u000a      national narratives based on tenuous evidence; the tablet they re-edited\u000a      had had a public image in Friesland because it was thought to provide the\u000a      first mention of a Frisian cow[i]. The benefit of\u000a      increased public understanding has been achieved through a number of\u000a      modes, in particular: museums (and museum publications), school\u000a      syllabuses, the internet, and newspaper and television reports.\u000a    Improving the Historical Understanding of Museum Visitors\u000a    This impact is achieved partly through the display of the Vindolanda\u000a      tablets at the British Museum. A selection of tablets is prominently\u000a      displayed in the centre of Gallery 49 (Roman Britain) and also in Gallery\u000a      70 (Roman Empire). The tablets have been chosen to represent Vindolanda's\u000a      varied mixture of private letters and official documents and to include\u000a      the most important and famous examples. The tablets are widely visited by\u000a      both UK and non-UK nationals. The British Museum has in recent years been\u000a      the UK's most popular visitor attraction, with nearly 6 million visitors a\u000a      year[1] (though the museum does not keep figures for general\u000a      visitors to particular galleries). The tablets are widely flagged on the\u000a      museum's website, where they are listed among the `Top Ten British\u000a      Treasures' chosen by museum curators (they were also voted the top\u000a      treasure by the British public following a TV programme devoted to the\u000a      treasures). There is also a page on the tablets in the `Young Explorers'\u000a      section of the Museum website. The Museum also promotes cultural\u000a      understanding of Vindolanda through publishing and selling online and in\u000a      its shop Bowman's book Life and Letters on the Roman Frontier:\u000a        Vindolanda and its People (1994; revised edition, 2003). This book\u000a      has sold more than 1,000 copies since the start of 2008.\u000a    The key role of Bowman's Oxford team was highlighted in a speech by Ralph\u000a      Jackson, Curator of Romano-British Collections at the British Museum. This\u000a      was at the Roman Society's celebration of Bowman's Vindolanda achievements\u000a      at its June 2011 AGM: `It is a tribute to the resourcefulness and sheer\u000a      stamina of both Team Birley and Team Bowman that a) we have so many\u000a      Tablets and b) their reconstructed texts and translations are available as\u000a      full editions with commentaries, both in paper-published form by the\u000a      British Museum Press and Britannia, and online at the Vindolanda Tablets\u000a      Online and British Museum websites: they are freely available world-wide\u000a      for public and scholar alike. I think that is an incredible feat of\u000a      endurance and a terrific success story and no-one has been more\u000a      indefatigable, tenacious and single-minded than Alan Bowman.'\u000a    A particularly significant local impact has also been achieved by the\u000a      display of tablets at the Vindolanda Museum. Nine tablets (three military\u000a      documents and six letters) have been on loan to the Museum since March\u000a      2011, when it re-opened following a multi-million pound re-development\u000a      after receiving funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and ONE North East.\u000a      It was the opportunity to display a selection of tablets that led the\u000a      museum to receive this funding. The tablets are on display in a newly\u000a      constructed exhibition space with an atmosphere controlled environment;\u000a      they are at the centre of the exhibition, surrounded by other original\u000a      Roman finds that have been excavated at Vindolanda. Visitor numbers to the\u000a      museum have increased greatly, rising from 82189 in 2010 to 91849 in 2011.\u000a      The qualitative feedback the Museum has received from visitors in response\u000a      to the tablets has been overwhelmingly positive. The fact that many\u000a      visitors stay locally overnight has greatly boosted the local economy.\u000a      Patricia Birley, the Director of the Vindolanda Trust, has acknowledged\u000a      the importance of the tablets as bringing `a unique angle to both our\u000a      collection and interpretation'[ii].\u000a    The re-reading of the Frisian tablet also had a local impact, as it was\u000a      marked by a public conference organised by the Tresoar and Fries Museum in\u000a      Leeuwarden in April 2009.\u000a    Influencing School Teaching\u000a    The pedagogical impact of the tablets is shown by the number of school\u000a      children who are taught about the tablets through visits to the British\u000a      Museum and the Vindolanda Museum. 9,834 school students and 1,490\u000a      adults\/teachers accompanying students visited Gallery 49 in the British\u000a      Museum in the year from June 2011 to June 2012. Following the loan of\u000a      tablets to the Vindolanda Museum, school visits increased by 15%. The\u000a      pedagogical impact of Bowman's research is also seen in the use of the\u000a      Vindolanda tablets in school syllabuses: they are a recommended primary\u000a      source for AQA Classical Civilisation GCSE, Topic 4H: Archaeology of Roman\u000a      Britain, and Bowman's Life and Letters is the recommended\u000a      secondary source for this module.[iii]\u000a    The tablets have had a broader pedagogical impact on Latin teaching in\u000a      primary schools thanks to the Minimus textbooks developed by\u000a      Barbara Bell[iv]. These popular textbooks introduce\u000a      school children to Latin through stories about a Vindolanda family and\u000a      through data known from the Vindolanda tablets. They have been used in\u000a      about 2,500 primary schools in the UK and have received wide media\u000a      coverage[v]. Volume 1 was originally published in 1999\u000a      but has continued to sell well with total sales figures of c.127,000 to\u000a      date. Foreign editions of this resource have also proved popular with a\u000a      translation into Slovenian published in 2012; these versions are\u000a      adaptations of the original, but still make use of Vindolanda material.\u000a      Further resources for teachers and activities for children, expanding on\u000a      the lives of the Vindolanda family are available on the Minimus\u000a      website. The success of the textbooks led to the creation of `Minimus the\u000a      Musical', which was performed in 2010 at schools in Bristol and in July\u000a      2012 in schools in Monmouth and London (with a total audience of more than\u000a      1000 for two performances). This pedagogical impact is also promoted by\u000a      the Vindolanda Museum, which has available a `Minimus Family Quiz', and by\u000a      a local guide who runs Minimus-themed Vindolanda tours[vi].\u000a    Promoting Historical Knowledge through the Internet\u000a    Images and texts of the tablets are made freely available through a\u000a      website\u000a      http:\/\/vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk\/\u000a      (first developed in February 2003). The digitization and on-line database\u000a      project was a collaboration between the Centre for the Study of Ancient\u000a      Documents [CSAD] and the Academic Computing Development Team at Oxford\u000a      University. Bowman's DPhil student Henriette Roued-Cunliffe created an\u000a      extension to the site in 2010 (vto2.classics.ox.ac.uk),\u000ausing\u000a      a web-services query system. The Vindolanda Tablets Online website\u000a      generates many favourable messages from non-academic users, a collection\u000a      of which is kept at the CSAD: to give one example, Tom Oatman from San\u000a      Antonio, Texas, emailed on 9 July 2012 to say that `I came across the\u000a      Vindolanda Tablet site while reading a book entitled Eating and Drinking\u000a      in Roman Britain. I was helping my daughter with a school project on \"a\u000a      day in the life of a plebeian\". What a fantastic effort to bring these\u000a      most interesting artefacts to the online community. I know that they've\u000a      been online for years, but I had never heard of the Vindolanda Tablets.\u000a      While helping my daughter with this project I have become enthralled by\u000a      the Roman Empire. Anyway, just wanted to tell you how absolutely\u000a      marvellous your site is.

Bowman, from whose\u000a      excellent Life and Letters on the Roman Frontier most of this has\u000a      been taken'.[vii]\u000a    Dahl's work was featured on the BBC News website in October 2012 as part\u000a      of the Knowledge Economy series[viii]. In the first 24\u000a      hours, this article had c. 1.2 million readers and was shared 20,000\u000a      times; it was the single most read education story on the BBC website in\u000a      2012. It also generated a very large number of emails from readers from a\u000a      wide range of backgrounds, including people from an Iranian background,\u000a      linguistics teachers, and the grandson of the Frenchman who found the\u000a      tablets[3]. The number of people expressing a desire to\u000a      get involved with the decipherment led Dahl to set up a website http:\/\/cdli.ox.ac.uk\/wiki\/proto-elamite.\u000a      This is part of the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative, of which Dahl is\u000a      co-PI; the wiki educational pages are managed entirely by Oriental Studies\u000a      at Oxford.\u000a    Cultural Impact through Television and Newspapers\u000a    Bowman appeared in a BBC2 Timewatch programme `Hadrian's Wall' which was\u000a      shown three times on BBC2 in 2008 (26 February, 16 July, 13 August), and\u000a      on BBC4 on 25 May 2009. There was an interview with Bowman on the tablets,\u000a      together with a demonstration of the RTI technology in use, in Neil\u000a      Oliver's History of Ancient Britain series (Series 2, programme 4,\u000a      Age of Romans, broadcast 26 May 2011). The conference on the Frisian\u000a      tablet also generated local and national newspaper and television reports.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Classicists at Oxford, led by Professor Alan Bowman, on\u000a      wooden tablets found at Vindolanda, a Roman fort on Hadrian's Wall, has\u000a      led to the publication of texts that have contributed greatly to public\u000a      knowledge of life in Roman Britain. This research has been made available\u000a      to the public at the British and Vindolanda Museums, and through printed\u000a      and visual media. It has been particularly important in the teaching of\u000a      Roman Britain and Latin in schools. Bowman's collaboration with colleagues\u000a      in Engineering to develop new techniques, to enable a better reading of\u000a      the texts of the tablets has received wide publicity, increasing public\u000a      knowledge of the methods of historical and scientific research. Research\u000a      by Bowman on a Frisian tablet has also had impact within the Netherlands;\u000a      in this case providing the benefit of public awareness of the problems of\u000a      the historical evidence that has been used to construct nationalistic\u000a      narratives. Jacob Dahl's application of the technology, developed in\u000a      Bowman's project to proto-Elamite tablets from south-west Iran has in turn\u000a      increased public knowledge of attempts to decipher an unknown script and\u000a      stimulated public engagement with the research.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Oxford\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2751792","Name":"Leeuwarden"}],"References":"\u000a    The key outputs on Vindolanda are:\u000a    \u000aA.K.Bowman, The Vindolanda Writing Tablets (British Museum\u000a      Press), vol. 2, 1994, with J.D.

Thomas) consisted in the imaging,\u000a      reading, and interpretation of wooden tablets excavated at the Roman fort\u000a      at Vindolanda. The tablets were written on fragments of small, thin wooden\u000a      leaf-tablets with carbon-based ink in the first and second centuries AD;\u000a      their publication has revealed much new information about life in Roman\u000a      Britain, involving detailed investigation of the Roman military occupation\u000a      of northern England. The research has fundamentally changed the way in\u000a      which we understand Roman frontier strategy and deployment in relation to\u000a      the era before the construction of Hadrian's Wall. Particularly\u000a      distinctive has been the increased knowledge in a number of areas where\u000a      there was very little evidence before. We now have a detailed\u000a      understanding of the palaeography of Old Roman Cursive script, and its\u000a      relation to the development of New Roman Cursive; evidence for the\u000a      development of Latin language at this vernacular level and its\u000a      relationship to early development of later vernacular Latin and `Romance'\u000a      languages; evidence for literary culture on Roman frontier among\u000a      `Romanised' military personnel from the lower Rhine area; and knowledge of\u000a      distinctive ways of using wooden tablets as writing material, which has\u000a      cast light on issues relevant to `history of the book'.\u000a    The research involves collaboration with the Vindolanda Trust, which is\u000a      responsible for the tablets' excavation and conservation, and the British\u000a      Museum, which is responsible for their curation and display. After\u000a      excavation and conservation at Vindolanda, by a team led by Robin Birley\u000a      and subsequently Andrew Birley, the Tablets were brought to the British\u000a      Museum where they were re-housed in custom-built storage. They were then\u000a      made available to Bowman and Thomas, who organised sophisticated,\u000a      cutting-edge imaging of the tablets. Since 1997, collaboration at Oxford\u000a      between Bowman and Professor Sir Michael Brady of the Department of\u000a      Engineering Science has been particularly important in advancing the\u000a      reading of the documents. Bowman and Brady worked together to develop\u000a      novel advanced image processing and artificial intelligence techniques\u000a      which enabled Bowman to analyse and read the Vindolanda texts more\u000a      efficiently. Merging engineering solutions with knowledge gathered from\u000a      experts in Classics resulted in a prototype system which could intake an\u000a      image of a Vindolanda text and output a plausible interpretation of the\u000a      words.\u000a    Oxford researchers have applied similar techniques to tablets found\u000a      elsewhere: Bowman's research on a stilus tablet from Tolsum in Frisia\u000a      produced a new text that removed what was thought to be the first mention\u000a      of a Frisian cow, while Dr Jacob Dahl has used the camera-dome developed\u000a      for the Vindolanda project to provide improved images of cuneiform tablets\u000a      to assist in the decipherment of the proto-Elamite writing system.\u000a      Together with Southampton, Oxford has become a hub for Reflectance\u000a      Transformation Imaging (RTI) research and implementation, embedding RTI in\u000a      its teaching and research.\u000a    The key researchers are A.K.

Both the act of translating and the studying\u000d\u000a      of prose pieces has been used by schoolchildren, storytellers, hobby\u000d\u000a      specialists and in undergraduate teaching.\u000d\u000a    Promoting greater understanding of Sumerian literature through story\u000d\u000a        telling\u000d\u000a    Amongst the many pieces of translated Sumerian literature available on\u000d\u000a      the ETCSL are several legendary examples such as the poems of Enheduanna\u000d\u000a      (the world's first named poet) and the Epic of Gilgamesh (often considered\u000d\u000a      the oldest written story on Earth). These are popularly used in\u000d\u000a      storytelling activities to give a greater understanding of the times from\u000d\u000a      which they originate. Dr Jeremy Black was the founding patron of The\u000d\u000a      Enheduanna Society, whose aim is \"popularising the literature of ancient\u000d\u000a      Iraq through the art of oral storytelling\".

Print-outs of ETCSL translations were\u000d\u000a      used as handouts at Zipang storytelling performances during this project[1].In\u000a      August 2011 Badia Obaid, an Arabic-speaking Zipang storyteller, gave an\u000d\u000a      oral storytelling performance in Arabic of the Huwawa story in a Moroccan\u000d\u000a      forest as a special guest at a storytelling festival in Morocco. The main\u000d\u000a      source for her performance was the ETCSL translation of this story[1].\u000d\u000a      The Society was also closely involved with providing storytelling sessions\u000d\u000a      during the British Museum's Babylon Exhibition in 2008-2009[ii].\u000d\u000a      Thus the ETCSL has been instrumental both in conveying knowledge of early\u000d\u000a      literature to diverse audiences and to help preserve the oral tradition\u000d\u000a      and culture of storytelling which was prevalent when these texts were\u000d\u000a      first transcribed.\u000d\u000a    Providing a resource for further publications for a general audience\u000d\u000a    The world of Sumerian literature has been made available to authors of\u000d\u000a      popular books, both through early Mesopotamian stories, but also as a way\u000d\u000a      of discovering and exploring the earliest known examples of various\u000d\u000a      topics.

The importance of this resource has been\u000d\u000a      attested to by numerous departments. Professor Eva Cancik-Kirschbaum from\u000d\u000a      the Freie Universit&#228;t Berlin feels that it is an important tool for\u000d\u000a      students on their BA course, to establish an understanding of the current\u000d\u000a      research on Sumerian Literature; allowing students to quickly and easily\u000d\u000a      search for specific phrases and, as it is website based, use it to\u000d\u000a      continue their studies when not on University premises[3].\u000d\u000a      Dr T.J.H.Krispijn from Leiden University describes the increasing\u000d\u000a      relevance of the ETCSL for his students: \"Since the amount of Dutch and\u000d\u000a      foreign students in Leiden without knowledge of French and German is\u000d\u000a      increasing, ETCLS (sic) has become an indispensable tool for reading\u000d\u000a      Sumerian literary texts.

Dr Dina Katz from the\u000d\u000a      Netherlands Institute for the Near East says \"I think that there is not\u000d\u000a      doubt that ETCSL revolutionized the study of ancient Babylonia...the\u000d\u000a      search functions result in a full overview of the use of words and\u000d\u000a      expressions in the literature, and a move of the curser over the text\u000d\u000a      which shows lemma and translation of the individual word makes an advanced\u000d\u000a      search in the dictionary easier\"[5]. Bertrand Lafont,\u000d\u000a      Research Director at CNRS History and Archaeology of the Orient Cuneiform\u000d\u000a      in Paris adds \"The field studies of Sumerian literature remains extremely\u000d\u000a      specialized...complex and difficult to access.

The\u000d\u000a      majority of the written sources date to the beginning of the 2nd\u000d\u000a      millennium BC (1900-1600 BC), with a few forerunners from the 3rd\u000d\u000a      millennium BC (as early as 2600 BC). The main 'classical' corpus can be\u000d\u000a      very roughly estimated at 50,000 lines of verse, including narrative\u000d\u000a      poetry, praise poetry, hymns, laments, prayers, songs, fables, didactic\u000d\u000a      poems, debate poems and proverbs. The majority of this has been\u000d\u000a      reconstructed during the past fifty years from thousands of often\u000d\u000a      fragmentary clay tablets inscribed in cuneiform writing. However,\u000d\u000a      relatively few compositions are published in satisfactory modern editions,\u000d\u000a      and many are scattered throughout a large number of journals and other\u000d\u000a      publications. Thus an acute need for a coherently and systematically\u000d\u000a      published, universally available textual corpus was identified.\u000d\u000a    In 1997, the late Dr Jeremy Black, a leading international scholar\u000d\u000a      specializing in the Sumerian language and Sumerian literature, assembled a\u000d\u000a      team in Oxford to start to gather electronic editions of all Sumerian\u000d\u000a      literary compositions from world leading specialists. Dr Black and his\u000d\u000a      team were hugely successful in creating this data resource, which in turn\u000d\u000a      became the foundation for two monographs and a large number of scholarly\u000d\u000a      articles by members of the team, and has transformed scholarship on\u000d\u000a      Sumerian literature and the Sumerian language. In 2001, the project\u000d\u000a      secured a five-year grant from The Arts and Humanities Board which made it\u000d\u000a      possible to continue to expand and enhance the corpus and expand the\u000d\u000a      project team.\u000d\u000a    The compositions are organised according to the catalogue of Sumerian\u000d\u000a      literature established by Chicago Assyriologist M. Civil. A composite\u000d\u000a      Sumerian language text is given for each composition with lists of the\u000d\u000a      manuscripts appended. For each composition, metadata is available as well\u000d\u000a      as a translation into prose English and a link to a full bibliography.\u000d\u000a      Within the corpus the translations are kept in English which is easily\u000d\u000a      accessible and divided into conceptual units separated into paragraphs.\u000d\u000a      Each paragraph is back-linked to a placeholder in the original Sumerian\u000d\u000a      text. The entire corpus has been lemmatized and is searchable. It also\u000d\u000a      provides the core linguistic corpus for the Electronic Pennsylvania\u000d\u000a      Sumerian Dictionary of the University of Pennsylvania. The corpus is XML\u000d\u000a      formatted and deposited with the Oxford Text Archive (OTA).\u000d\u000a    The quality of the online material is very high. The list of contributors\u000d\u000a      (for each individual composition) includes only the absolute best\u000d\u000a      specialists. The team of Dr Black at The University of Oxford, including\u000d\u000a      Dr Graham Cunningham, Dr G&#225;bor Z&#243;lyomi and Dr Eleanor Robson, amalgamated,\u000d\u000a      and streamlined these sources to produce a uniform and consistent corpus.\u000d\u000a      The translations, although they follow published editions, are the work of\u000d\u000a      Dr Black and his team.\u000d\u000a    A majority of the scholarly work on Sumerian Literature conducted across\u000d\u000a      the world currently either relies on the ETCSL, or relates to it. Project\u000d\u000a      members have published dozen of articles and several books based on\u000d\u000a      research conducted in connection with the project. Robson's 1995 study,\u000d\u000a      for example, used the ETCSL dataset to enhance our understanding of\u000d\u000a      education in ancient Babylonia by moving beyond a simplistic view of\u000d\u000a      education based on self-referential literature to an empirical view of\u000d\u000a      what was studied when. Black's 2004 article enhanced our understanding of\u000d\u000a      one particular segment of a Sumerian literary composition (Dumuzi and his\u000d\u000a      sisters) drawing on other texts in the ETCSL, whereas the special volume\u000d\u000a      of ASJ (Black and Zolyomi 2005) contained articles on various points of\u000d\u000a      grammar using a corpus based approach.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4874","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the APRGD (which has received wide public recognition\u000a      globally) has taken the following forms:\u000a    \u000a      Deepening the quality of contemporary productions of classical theatre\u000a        through work with theatre practitioners from 1996 onwards, thereby\u000a        helping to develop new skills, insights and ways of working for\u000a        directors, poet-translators, composers, designers, choreographers and\u000a        actors, and drawing in audiences for new cultural experiences and\u000a        bringing acclaim to the UK theatre sector.\u000a      Commissioning new theatrical work from 2005-10 through the `Onassis\u000a        Programme for the Performance of Greek Drama'.\u000a      Helping to create an appetite for classical theatre through public\u000a        engagement activities, and so contributing to knowledge and the quality\u000a        of life.\u000a      Offering the pedagogical benefit of open-access information about the\u000a        history of performances of Greek and Roman drama.\u000a    \u000a    1.

The\u000a      poet-playwright, Tony Harrison has commented: `The life of drama is in\u000a      performance and the APGRD opens up what has been locked in a more narrow\u000a      academic discipline into a potentially much wider and more generally\u000a      available field of interest and study'.[2] The research team\u000a      has had significant input at rehearsals initiating discussions on the\u000a      historical dimension of drama and performance interpretation.

It is a place that hears the modern and resonates the ancient in\u000a      response to a creative contemporary context'.[3] Research using\u000a      the APGRD's resources has also directly fostered professional careers in\u000a      theatre: Avery Willis, whose Oxford doctoral thesis on Euripides' Troades\u000a      was based on APGRD material, has established a career working with Peter\u000a      Sellars in the USA; former BA Postdoctoral Fellow Kathleen Riley has\u000a      worked with actors including Nigel Hawthorne, Edward Petherbridge and\u000a      Kathryn Hunter and with the playwright Frank McGuinness on his forthcoming\u000a      Trojan Women. Helen Eastman, APGRD's Onassis Producer 2005-2011,\u000a      has received numerous playwriting commissions from UK theatre companies,\u000a      including the acclaimed Hercules (Chester 2010).\u000a    Collaborations since 2008 include the following:\u000a    \u000a      Macintosh's work on Gilbert Murray and Bernard Shaw was discussed with\u000a        Tony Harrison for his play FRAM and featured in the programme notes for\u000a        Nick Hytner's production of Major Barbara (both Royal National\u000a        Theatre 2008).\u000a      Hall was consultant on Die Perser at Braunschweig State\u000a        Theatre, directed by Claudia Bosse (May\/June 2008).\u000a      Macintosh acted as dramaturge for a devised chorus piece choreographed\u000a        by Struan Leslie (Head of Movement, RSC) and Simon Deacon (Composer) at\u000a        RNT Studios (August 2008).\u000a      Taplin conceived and provided translations for the show Powerful\u000a          Voices: Women in Ancient Greek Drama, presented by the Alexander\u000a        S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation (USA) at Florence Gould Hall, New\u000a        York, in December 2008.\u000a      19 performances of Taplin's adaptation The Wanderings of Odysseus\u000a        were put on at the Stanford University Summer Theater programme,\u000a        July-August 2010; and at the Cacoyannis Centre, Athens, September 2012.\u000a    \u000a    2. Commissioning new work\u000a    The research undertaken by the APGRD led to the establishment of the\u000a      Onassis Programme for the Performance of Greek Drama at Oxford (www.onassis.ox.ac.uk),\u000a      whose audiences numbered over 30,000 in over 30 UK cities from 2005-2011.\u000a      This programme commissions and produces work[ii] by\u000a      international theatre artists inspired by classical Greek drama, notably\u000a      the opera version of Seamus Heaney's The Burial at Thebes,\u000a      directed by Derek Walcott, with music by Dominique le Gendre (2008), and\u000a      Glyn Maxwell's After Troy (2011), which resulted from dialogues\u000a      with Taplin. Rehearsed public readings by professional actors of new\u000a      versions of ancient plays have brought writers, audiences and academics\u000a      together at the APGRD to develop new plays (including Goddess from a\u000a        Machine by Peter Morris, Ismene by Stacey Gregg, and The\u000a        Angry Wounds by Julian Armitstead). One of the commissioned audio\u000a      plays for the `Pots and Plays' event at the Ashmolean in May 2011, Vanessa\u000a      Badham's Bull, went on to become The Bull, the Moon and the\u000a        Coronet of Stars, which enjoyed a successful Australian tour in\u000a      2013.\u000a    3. Public engagement and access to research\u000a    The open-access APGRD website and online database have had approximately\u000a      50,000 visits since 2008 (25,000 of whom have used the database) and is\u000a      being used as a model for similar projects at Northwestern University and\u000a      NYU.\u000a    The APGRD research team has put on several public exhibitions and\u000a      lectures. For example, the Onassis production of Tom Paulin's Medea\u000a      (2010) was accompanied by an exhibition of APGRD materials relating to Medea's\u000a      performance history; Derek Walcott's script and drawings were exhibited\u000a      for the opera The Burial at Thebes (2008); and in November 2011\u000a      the APGRD organised an exhibition, in conjunction with the National\u000a      Theatre Archive and the Jocelyn Herbert Archive to mark the 30th\u000a      Anniversary of the Oresteia (Royal National Theatre 1981), and an\u000a      event for 200 guests with a discussion with the translator Tony Harrison,\u000a      a performance by the actor Greg Hicks (Orestes in 1981), and a talk about\u000a      Harrison Birtwistle's score.\u000a    The APGRD series of public lectures has regularly featured prominent\u000a      international playwrights and theatre directors, including Frank\u000a      McGuinness, Martin Crimp and Poland's Wlodzimierz Staniewski (together\u000a      with the UK premiere of his film, `Iphigenia at Aulis', 2009). Frank\u000a      McGuinness' discussion with Macintosh is available online (podcasts.ox.ac.uk).\u000aAPGRD\u000a      researchers have also given public talks on aspects of classical theatre\u000a      and have been featured on BBC Radios 3 and 4.[iv] Taplin and\u000a      Hall joined Tony Harrison for a Platform Talk at the National Theatre in\u000a      relation to Harrison's play FRAM (2008). Macintosh has been a speaker at a\u000a      number of Oxford Festival of Dance events. Taplin has been a regular\u000a      contributor to Radio 4's Front Row and Radio 3's Night Waves. Hall has\u000a      appeared on Start the Week, In Our Time, Women's Hour and in a number of\u000a      TV documentaries. Macintosh has appeared on Night Waves; presented the\u000a      programme `Euripides' in the Radio 3 series The Essay: Greek and Latin\u000a      Voices (broadcast 6\/3\/2008); and contributed to the Radio 4 programme\u000a      `Freudian Slippage: Part 1' (broadcast 13\/12\/2010), which was inspired by\u000a      her chapter in the APGRD 2004 volume Dionysus since 69.\u000a    The APGRD is cited by the AHRC on its website as an outstanding example\u000a      of a Humanities project that has made a considerable impression on the\u000a      world outside academia. The APGRD was also successfully nominated by the\u000a      AHRC for inclusion in the 'cultural and community' section of the RCUK\u000a      'Impacts: Achieving investment in the UK - Research through Partnership'\u000a      publication.[iii]\u000a    4. Pedagogical benefits\u000a    The research done by the APGRD has had varied pedagogical benefits.[v]\u000a      In particular, all Onassis productions have been accompanied by workshops\u000a      for schools and downloadable packs for teachers which make extensive use\u000a      of APGRD materials; the APGRD website includes a `Learning' section with\u000a      short essays by young scholars aimed at school and undergraduate students\u000a      of Classics, English, Film and Theatre Studies. Macintosh's Radio 3\u000a      programme on Euripides is also course material for Open University course\u000a      A275 `Reading Classical Greek: language and literature'. Professor Robin\u000a      Osborne (Cambridge) has described the APGRD as one of the `great research\u000a      projects', which enables `patterns to be discerned that could not\u000a      previously have been seen' (Bulletin of the Council of University\u000a        Classical Departments 40 (2011), p.5). Building on its contacts in\u000a      the creative and heritage industries, the APGRD has run two AHRC- funded\u000a      public engagement\/collaborative skills training courses from 2010-2013 for\u000a      20 doctoral\/early career researchers from 15 different HEIs.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama (APGRD) project\u000a      approaches the understanding of Greek and Roman tragedies and comedies\u000a      through gathering evidence about their performance and traces their\u000a      evolving significance through the way they have been received in\u000a      performance practice. The APGRD has had significant impact on theatrical\u000a      performance through its lively interaction with practitioners in the\u000a      theatre and other performing arts, which has expanded the repertoire of\u000a      classical drama, and through the commissioning of new work.

First, it gathers and preserves physical materials relating to\u000a      the history of ancient drama in modern performance, such as playbills,\u000a      programmes, reviews, drawings, photographs and audio-visual recordings;\u000a      these materials are stored in the Stelios Ioannou School for Research in\u000a      Classical and Byzantine Studies in Oxford and are available for public\u000a      consultation on request. Secondly, it compiles a comprehensive production\u000a      history of ancient drama on the modern stage, published electronically as\u000a      the APGRD database. Thirdly, it publishes interpretative research based on\u000a      these findings, exploring the cultural and political contexts of\u000a      performances (fifteen volumes have been published since 2000, including\u000a      both monographs and collections of essays based on conferences organised\u000a      by the APGRD). The research has focussed on the performance reception of\u000a      particular plays (e.g. the Agamemnon and Medea), on ancient material\u000a      evidence for performances (e.g. the Pronomos Vase); and on a number of\u000a      relatively under-studied areas of ancient drama (music, dance, pantomime).\u000a      This research has shed light on the cultural dynamics of the modern\u000a      appropriation of ancient drama, with particular reference to political\u000a      concerns such as gender and civic definition. It has pioneered a new area\u000a      within Classics and Classical Reception Studies, `Classical Performance\u000a      Reception' and has uncovered forgotten theatrical scripts (notably the\u000a      Greek tragic burlesques in the Lord Chamberlain's Play Collection that\u000a      demonstrate unequivocally that ancient drama was not the exclusive\u000a      preserve of the educated elite in the nineteenth century).

Such information has an often dramatic effect on the value and\u000d\u000asaleability of the material, as well as fostering good practice in provenance research.\u000d\u000aConsequently, catalogues of the main international auction houses now cite Beazley Archive\u000d\u000aDatabase numbers in provenance information.\u000d\u000aScrutinising the Antiquities Trade[i, ii]\u000d\u000aThe Database is equally used by those combating the looting and illegal trade in antiquities.\u000d\u000aProminent critics of the trade use the Database to establish whether works for sale have been in\u000d\u000acirculation before the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the\u000d\u000aIllicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. It is the first recourse for those\u000d\u000awanting to check whether a Greek vase has a long history above the ground, and thereby to\u000d\u000ascrutinise the wider practices of the trade.\u000d\u000aMuseums\u000d\u000aCurators in museums with relevant collections routinely use the Database to understand their own\u000d\u000aobjects.

This case-study relates to two parts of the\u000d\u000aDatabase which have been constructed on the basis of in-house research &#8212; those covering pottery\u000d\u000aand gems &#8212; as described below. For the sake of clarity they will be referred to in this section as\u000d\u000aseparate databases, although technically they are a single resource accessed on one server\u000d\u000athrough a single programme.\u000d\u000a(i) Pottery Database:\u000d\u000aThe Pottery Database documents more than 107,000 ancient Greek painted pots and fragments,\u000d\u000aprimarily those produced in ancient Athens during the 6th to 4th centuries BC. The pottery\u000d\u000adatabase was begun in its pre-web form in 1979, but an estimated 86% of the current records have\u000d\u000abeen created, edited or expanded since 1 January 1993 (with high-quality images added to more\u000d\u000athan 53,000 of the records since that date). Effectively, all usage of the Database therefore\u000d\u000anecessarily relies on research conducted within the relevant census period.\u000d\u000aThe underpinning research for the database involves the construction of records that: describe\u000d\u000apainted pots; identify their place and period of production; identify the elements of their\u000d\u000aiconography; compile thorough image-bibliographies; and document past attributions to particular\u000d\u000apot-painters. The records are stored in XML format on a bespoke XDB (`extensible') database\u000d\u000adesigned in 2004 by the Beazley Archive's IT director, Gregory Parker. The database seeks to\u000d\u000ainclude classical Athenian pots appearing in every available publication, including auction\u000d\u000acatalogues. A fundamental part of the research process is identifying painted pots on the art\u000d\u000amarket if they have previously been recorded, or creating new records for them if they have not.\u000d\u000aResearchers have also integrated into the records the English and ancient Greek text from H.\u000d\u000aImmerwahr's Corpus of Attic Vase Inscriptions (http:\/\/www.lib.unc.edu\/dc\/attic\/) and data\/images\u000d\u000afrom the Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum, which the Archive digitizes on behalf of the Union\u000d\u000aAcad&#233;mique Internationale. The Database has become the world's main resource (unrivalled\u000d\u000aexcept by the vases themselves) for research into ancient Athenian pottery. This is evidenced, for\u000d\u000aexample, by the fact that Beazley Archive Database record numbers are now regularly used as a\u000d\u000astandard, internationally recognised means of citing individual pots.\u000d\u000a(ii) Gems Database:\u000d\u000aBegun in 2002, the Gems database now has more than 25,400 records comprising texts and\u000d\u000aimages of individual engraved gems or sets of gems and impressions. Its main purpose is to\u000d\u000adocument unpublished or dispersed collections and series of ancient and neoclassical gems. The\u000d\u000aunderpinning research involves archival study and examination of the gems\/impressions\u000d\u000athemselves in order to identify and date them, and to interpret their iconography and significance.\u000d\u000aThe main collections covered include: Corpus of Classical Phoenician Scarabs; Poniatowski\u000d\u000aCollection; Marlborough Collection; Paoletti and Amastini impressions; James Tassie impressions;\u000d\u000aDanicourt Collection.\u000d\u000aResearch for the pottery and gems database records was carried out between 1 January 1993 and\u000d\u000a31 December 2013 by the following staff: Dr Thomas Mannack (Senior Researcher, 1993-2013);\u000d\u000aDr Claudia Wagner (Senior Researcher, 2002-2013); Melanie Mendon&#231;a (Research Assistant,\u000d\u000a1993-6); Alastair Harden (Research Assistant, 2010-2013).

Commercial\u000d\u000a        archaeologists have recognised\u000d\u000a        that this makes samian ware a tool for addressing broader socio-economic\u000d\u000a        issues: `It has\u000d\u000a        stimulated me to look at wider questions of dating and trade patterns' [B\u000d\u000a          &#167;2]; `the index\u000d\u000a        contains a mass of data which can be used to look at wider economic and\u000d\u000a        social questions -\u000d\u000a        how pottery was marketed, who used it etc' [B &#167;3]; it is `an\u000d\u000a        invaluable tool providing a basis not\u000d\u000a        only for identification and dating, but as a data-source for social and\u000d\u000a        economic studies' [B &#167;6].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The volumes have been distributed in Europe, the US, Australia and South\u000d\u000a      Africa and are already\u000d\u000a      held by university libraries around the world.

After his retirement\u000d\u000a      Hartley continued, supported\u000d\u000a      by the Department of Classics, to analyse and develop the material until\u000d\u000a      his death in 2005. Leeds\u000d\u000a      colleagues, including his long-time collaborator Brenda Dickinson\u000d\u000a      (Honorary Visiting Fellow in\u000d\u000a      Classics 2006-12), brought the project to fruition.\u000d\u000a    The Leeds Index of Samian Pottery Stamps (as the project is\u000d\u000a      widely known) collects around\u000d\u000a      300,000 stamp-die records and signatures, the product of over 5,000\u000d\u000a      different potters creating the\u000d\u000a      fine red ware popularly called `samian ware', or more technically terra\u000d\u000a        sigillata, which was\u000d\u000a      manufactured in the first to the third centuries by workshops in south,\u000d\u000a      central and eastern Gaul.\u000d\u000a    This is the first catalogue of its type to appear since 1931. The\u000d\u000a      importance of samian as a tool for\u000d\u000a      dating archaeological contexts and the vast increase in samian finds since\u000d\u000a      then prompted the\u000d\u000a      authors to record the potters' work in greater detail, illustrating, where\u000d\u000a      possible, each individual\u000d\u000a      stamp or signature which the potter used, and enumerating examples of each\u000d\u000a      vessel type on which\u000d\u000a      it appears, together with details of where it was found and is now held.\u000d\u000a      Dating of the potters'\u000d\u000a      activity is supported, where possible, by corroborative evidence - the\u000d\u000a      occurrence of material in\u000d\u000a      historically-dated contexts or its association with other stamps or\u000d\u000a      signatures dated by this method.\u000d\u000a    The bulk of the material was examined personally by the authors, from\u000d\u000a      kiln sites and occupation\u000d\u000a      sites in France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Britain, but the catalogue\u000d\u000a      also includes published\u000d\u000a      records, which they were able to verify, from across the Roman Empire.\u000d\u000a    It is a unique resource &amp;mdaSh; distinguished both by its size and its\u000d\u000a      extensive use of images &#8212; and\u000d\u000a      illuminates the organisation and distribution mechanisms of one of the\u000d\u000a      major industries of the\u000d\u000a      Roman empire, providing an invaluable supplement to the evidence of coins\u000d\u000a      and other datable\u000d\u000a      material in the construction of excavated site chronologies.\u000d\u000a    The importance of the research is indicated by the level of funding the\u000d\u000a      project has attracted: a\u000d\u000a      British Academy grant of &#163;71,707 (10\/2006-9\/2007) for the pilot The\u000d\u000a        Leeds Index of Samian\u000d\u000a        Potters' Stamps, followed by an AHRC grant of &#163;408,527 for The\u000d\u000a        Samian Pottery Industries of\u000d\u000a        Roman Gaul (3\/2008-2\/2012), including two PhD studentships. Prof.\u000d\u000a      Mike Fulford (Reading) is\u000d\u000a      named as Principal Investigator on both grant applications, but all the\u000d\u000a      research was carried out at\u000d\u000a      Leeds, where the project was managed by Dr Roger Brock\u000d\u000a      (1990-present, Senior Lecturer since\u000d\u000a      2002). Prof. Robert Maltby (1987-2011, Professor of Latin Philology from\u000d\u000a      2000), and latterly Dr\u000d\u000a      Steve Green (2004-13, Senior Lecturer from 2008), supervised Andreas\u000d\u000a      Gavrielatos' PhD\u000d\u000a      studentship into `A study of the names on terra sigillata in Gaul\u000d\u000a      from the 1st to the 3rd centuries\u000d\u000a      AD'. A second studentship was held at Reading, under Prof. Fulford's\u000d\u000a      supervision.\u000d\u000a    Rosemary Wilkinson (Research Assistant in Classics at Leeds, 2006-2012)\u000d\u000a      prepared the Names\u000d\u000a        on Terra Sigillata volumes [1] for publication and marked up\u000d\u000a      entries for the ongoing process of\u000d\u000a      integration with the online database in the suite of Samian Research\u000d\u000a      databases at the R&#246;misch-\u000d\u000a      Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz [2].

These have helped to increase the\u000a      Museum's footfall, and have brought about changes in the type of event the\u000a      Museum includes in its programme. Impact on members of the public includes\u000a      enrichment of their engagement with cultural heritage.\u000a    i) As part of the Leeds-City-Council coordinated Light Night\u000a      (October 2010), the event Underworlds Live at Leeds was designed\u000a      by Dr Eleanor OKell (Visiting Fellow in Classics since September 2009) and\u000a      Stafford, drawing on [2] and [3]. This walking tour\u000a      incorporated Leeds City Museum's Ancient Worlds Galleries and various city\u000a      sights into a journey through the ancient Underworld. Oral feedback from\u000a      audience members on the night indicated that the event drew new visitors\u000a      into the Museum who would visit again.\u000a    Building on this success, for Light Night 2011 the same team\u000a      designed In the Footsteps of Hercules. Research insights from work\u000a      on the monograph [1] underpinned a presentation of Hercules which\u000a      linked ancient versions of his story with artefacts in the City Museum's\u000a      Ancient Worlds Galleries and public sculpture around Leeds. Participants\u000a      were guided by a map, interpretative poster-points linked each\u000a      item\/location to an episode &#8212; e.g. the Town Hall's lionskin- clad head of\u000a      Hercules with the Nemean Lion labour &#8212; and actors playing mythological\u000a      characters provided live story-telling. One stop on the tour, `Tales of\u000a      Hercules' (Stafford and actor), invited the public to hear\u000a      Iphikles' comically subversive version of his more famous brother's\u000a      exploits.\u000a    The Museum commented that the tour `represented a departure from previous\u000a      practice for the Museum' and that they were `keen to repeat' this\u000a      innovation [A]; they noted visitor-numbers of c.4000, equivalent to\u000a      a whole week's footfall in the peak school holiday period, and commented\u000a      that the event `had helped attract new audiences to the Museum on the\u000a      night and [had] encouraged them to return to the Museum at a later date' [B].\u000a      The Museum was keen to commit to further classically-themed events for Light\u000a        Nights 2012 and 2013 (see REF 3a).\u000a    ii) As detailed in REF3a, the series Classics in Our\u000a        Lunchtimes launched at the City Museum in October 2011. These talks\u000a      have included two by Stafford: Olympic Beginnings (June\u000a      2012) drew on the monograph's [1] discussion of Herakles' role as\u000a      founder of the Olympic Games; Hercules' Choice: from ancient\u000a        Greece to Temple Newsam (May 2013) drew on paper [4], while\u000a      focusing on a particular example in Leeds Museums and Galleries' own\u000a      collection. The Museum commented that Stafford's `participation in\u000a      the series gave an opportunity for a new exploration of the Greek\u000a      collection and its themes' and that someone with her `research expertise\u000a      could help bring the collections to life' [A]. Audience feedback\u000a      rated both talks `excellent' or `very good' and indicated that almost all\u000a      were likely to attend again [C].\u000a    b) Impact on exhibition design and event-programming at Leeds City\u000a        Museum and beyond\u000a    Between May 2012 and July 2013 Stafford began a collaboration\u000a      with Prof. John Prag (former Curator at Manchester Museum) working on an\u000a      exhibition based on Marian Maguire's The Labours of Herakles\u000a      series (above &#167;2). In preliminary designs for the exhibition, Stafford\u000a      drew on the research of all four outputs. Discussion with Leeds City\u000a      Museum over the same period led to its agreement to host this exhibition\u000a      in spring 2015, displaying the modern prints alongside a number of\u000a      antiquities and post-classical artefacts depicting Herakles, thus\u000a      presenting the same 2,500-year continuum discussed in her monograph.\u000a    The impact here is on the Museum's event-programming and on their\u000a      exhibition practice. Making this kind of use of modern art in the display\u000a      of pre-modern artefacts is an innovation for the Museum, extending the\u000a      range of established practice. They have welcomed the `exciting\u000a      opportunity... to juxtapose contemporary artworks with objects from the\u000a      Leeds and Manchester collections' [A], `to tease out different\u000a      stories... and bring to the public items that have rarely been exhibited\u000a      or are less accessible' [D].\u000a    Between February and July 2013 four other museums have agreed to host the\u000a      exhibition after its initial showing in Leeds: in the UK, Liverpool's\u000a      Garstang Museum [E] and the Cambridge Museum of Classical\u000a      Archaeology; in Germany, the Munich Antikensammlungen [F] and\u000a      W&#252;rzburg's Martin von Wagner Museum. These form the nucleus of an\u000a      international tour which will span a period from spring 2015 to winter\u000a      2016; talks are on-going with other institutions, including Newcastle's\u000a      Great North Museum, Edinburgh University Library, the Mus&#233;e Royal de\u000a      Mariemont in Belgium and the Nicholson Museum in Sydney.\u000a    At each confirmed venue Stafford has been consulted on how the\u000a      Maguire prints might be shown alongside a selection of objects from the\u000a      local collections, again drawing on the monograph's central argument about\u000a      cross-cultural continuities.\u000a    The impact here is again on event-programming, and on the museums'\u000a      exhibition practices. For example: `The project that [Stafford] has\u000a      developed with the Maguire exhibition in Leeds is a totally new way of\u000a      thinking about displaying classical collections. It's not something we\u000a      have ever done before and it is a model that we are really interested in,\u000a      because it offers a way to help us to interpret our collections and\u000a      attract people to the museum beyond the normal range of public engagement'\u000a      [E].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research 2005-12 has opened up new perspectives on Herakles-Hercules,\u000a      tracing links between the ancient hero and his post-classical\u000a      incarnations, and laying the foundations for further study of Hercules'\u000a      long-lasting cross-cultural significance. The impact has three strands:\u000a    \u000a      on individual public users &#8212; enriching lives via novel interpretations\u000a        of the quintessential ancient Greek hero;\u000a      on the public engagement practice of Leeds City Museum 2011-13;\u000a      on the planning process for the 2015-16 programme of a range of\u000a        museums in the UK, continental Europe and beyond which are to host an\u000a        innovative type of touring exhibition.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Leeds\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Leeds (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Leeds","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007795}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2867714","Name":"München"},{"GeoNamesId":"2790697","Name":"Morlanwelz-Mariemont"},{"GeoNamesId":"2805615","Name":"Würzburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2867714","Name":"Munich"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

This\u000a      culminated in the monograph [1], which investigates Herakles' role\u000a      in ancient Greek and Roman literature, art, politics and religion, and his\u000a      many manifestations between antiquity and the present day. Herakles\u000a      has a particularly wide scope, due to the subject's extraordinary range in\u000a      the ancient world &#8212; in terms of chronology (he is present from the\u000a      earliest Greek to the latest Latin sources), of medium (he appears in all\u000a      genres of literature, all kinds of artwork), and of weight of narrative\u000a      (three times as many episodes attach to him as to any other ancient hero)\u000a      &#8212; and to Herakles' extraordinary status as both hero and god.\u000a    The book's substantial final chapter sketches the hero-god's continuing\u000a      presence in literature and art from late antiquity via the Renaissance to\u000a      the twenty-first century. It includes consideration of: Hercules'\u000a      appropriation by Christianity; his emergence in the Renaissance as a\u000a      exemplary figure and a prototype for virtuous living; his role as\u000a      political emblem; his particular relevance to France, as supposed\u000a      forefather of the monarchy and paradoxical hero of the Revolution;\u000a      re-workings of Sophokles' and Euripides' tragedies on Hercules' death and\u000a      madness; the hero's appearance in modern popular media. The book's major\u000a      contribution is that, by bringing together a wider range of material than\u000a      has ever previously been assembled (visual as well as literary, from Homer\u000a      to the present day), it has facilitated cross-cultural, cross-media\u000a      comparisons, drawing attention to significant continuities as well as\u000a      culturally-specific disjunctions.\u000a    The three papers [2-4] were foundational for the 2012 book,\u000a      developing particular themes in more depth than possible in the book.\u000a      Paper [2] enlists the case of Herakles in the on-going scholarly\u000a      debate over the relationship between ritual (especially sacrificial)\u000a      practice and the character of its recipient, arguing against a recent\u000a      trend which has seen the two as unrelated. Paper [3] focuses on the\u000a      issue of Herakles' liminal status as a hero-god, and shows that the\u000a      articulation of this status in the story of his apotheosis is the most\u000a      distinctive aspect of his multi-faceted mythology. Paper [4] takes\u000a      as its point of departure Prodikos' famous story of the young Herakles'\u000a      choice between a life of vice and one of virtue, presented to him by Vice\u000a      and Virtue personified. It argues that the Greek hero has a particular\u000a      tendency to association with personifications, which is in turn a feature\u000a      of his aptness for allegorical narrative &#8212; an insight important to the\u000a      monograph's narrative of continuity between ancient and post-classical\u000a      images of the hero.\u000a    The final chapter of [1] includes discussion of a reinterpretation\u000a      of the hero by the contemporary New Zealand artist Marian Maguire: her\u000a      series of etchings and lithographs The Labours of Herakles feature\u000a      a Herakles inspired by Attic black-figure vases inserted into\u000a      nineteenth-century scenes of New Zealand, making witty comment on European\u000a      colonisation. Correspondence between Stafford and Maguire arising\u000a      from the book led to the artist's agreement to present her work at the Hercules:\u000a        a Hero for All Ages conference at Leeds in June 2013 (supported by a\u000a      grant from Creative New Zealand) and was crucial to development of the\u000a      exhibition detailed below (4b).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7379","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Davidson's research on sexuality and sexual relations in Ancient Greece\u000a      presents a different understanding of Ancient Greek society and culture,\u000a      feeding into public discussions about the nature of homosexual relations\u000a      in Ancient Greece, and about the relationship between Antiquity and modern\u000a      society. It has been adopted by members of the GLBT community and\u000a      advocates for legalising same sex marriage as illustrating the historical\u000a      precedence for same sex relationships. The book and its US edition (Random\u000a      House, 2009), were published during the height of debate about same sex\u000a      marriage in a number of US states. An article in the popular American\u000a      online magazine Slate (4 million readers a day) made explicit the\u000a      connection between Davidson's research and the debate about whether\u000a      homosexual relationships should be afforded the same status as\u000a      heterosexual ones. Greek Love is described as a `landmark study'\u000a      and recommended as `required reading for anybody curious about the\u000a      antecedents of the current impasse' in American state legislatures. It\u000a      `provides an important invitation to open our eyes to the multiplicity of\u000a      ways in which people loved one another in Ancient Greece.' Michael Dirda\u000a      in the Washington Post (2009) claims that `though Davidson never\u000a      says it outright, The Greeks and Greek Love tacitly validates\u000a      modern same sex marriage.' References to the book also abound in blogs\u000a      posted around the world on the classics and Ancient Greece, books and the\u000a      publishing industry, gay rights and popular media. The UK policy think\u000a      tank Policy Exchange referenced Greek Love for its exploration of\u000a      the historical case for gay marriage in Ancient Greece in its 2012\u000a      publication recommending that the government legislate for equal marriage\u000a      (`What's in a name? Is there a case for equal marriage?').\u000a    The impact of Davidson's research in the United States on the publishing\u000a      industry and the reading public is further evidenced by public\u000a      recognition. Greek Love received the Mark Lynton History Prize\u000a      (2010) from the Nieman Foundation for Journalism and the Columbia School\u000a      of Journalism awarded to the `book-length work of history on any subject\u000a      that best combines intellectual or scholarly distinction with felicity of\u000a      expression.' The book was also awarded the Randy Shilts Award for Gay\u000a      non-fiction by Publishing Triangle, a New York based organisation which\u000a      promotes books and other written materials by LGBT authors or with LGBT\u000a      themes. It was one of three Stonewall Honour Books in Non-Fiction in 2010\u000a      which is sponsored by the American Library Association; and was the winner\u000a      of the Lambda Award for LGBT non-fiction (2010) which honours books on any\u000a      subject written for the general reader. The reach of the impact is\u000a      evidenced by the number of copies of Davidson's books sold worldwide,\u000a      selling more than 20,000 copies combined (Nielsen Bookscan). His books, Courtesans\u000a        and Fishcakes and Greek Love have been translated into\u000a      German and Greek, further demonstrating the significance of Davidson's\u000a      impact and extending the impact internationally. The books were reviewed\u000a      extensively in national newspapers in the UK (Daily Telegraph, The\u000a        Guardian, The Independent), Canada (The Globe and Mail),\u000a      Australia (The Australian) and the USA (New York Times, Washington\u000a        Post and Washington Times) and in British, Australian,\u000a      American and French magazines (Spectator, Prospect, The\u000a        Monthly, Slate, L'Economie Politique). There has\u000a      been a great interest in Davidson's books in online forums and blogs,\u000a      including the BBC TV blog (2013) and the newspaper Frankfurter\u000a        Allgemeine Zeitung's blogs (2009).\u000a    As well as print media and popular online interest, Davidson's research\u000a      has also been featured on radio and television programmes. He was\u000a      consulted and interviewed for the television programme `The Bible: A\u000a      History' about St Paul and sexuality (Channel 4, Jan 2010, avg 1 million\u000a      viewers). He contributed to the BBC Radio 4 programme `A History of the\u000a      World in 100 Objects' (May 2010, avg 4 million listeners per episode); Greek\u000a        Love is also referenced as further reading for the Warren Cup on the\u000a      British Museum website. Davidson was consulted for the BBC Radio 3\u000a      programme `Out in the World - A Global Gay History' which aired in 2011\u000a      and 2012 (approx. listening figures per episode 78,000). A reading from Courtesans\u000a        and Fishcakes was featured on `Something Understood', BBC Radio 4,\u000a      2008 (estimated figures 441,480).\u000a    Greek Love also led to Davidson being invited to write a series of\u000a      pamphlets on Greek Mythology for The Guardian in January 2008\u000a      (daily paper circulation 378,394), still available on the newspaper's\u000a      website (4 million unique visitors per day). Davidson has been a\u000a      contributor to the London Review of Books since the early 1990s,\u000a      writing over 20 articles on Greek mythology, politics, social life,\u000a      literature and art. Since 2008 Davidson has written two book reviews (Atlantis\u000a        Story, 2008; Lexicon of Greek Personal Names, 2010) and an\u000a      exhibition review (Bronze, Royal Academy, 2012). His podcast `Sex in the\u000a      Ancient World', recorded in 2009 and available on Warwick's iTunesU\u000a      channel has received 89,747 downloads (figures available to 02\/12). His\u000a      public appearances include a talk about Greek Love at Gay's the\u000a      World Bookshop in London (admission free; 29.01.2009) as part of its 30th\u000a        anniversary celebrations. The event was included in The\u000a        Guardian Saturday Review: Events (24.01.2009). He\u000a      participated in a discussion panel on `The Greeks' for the Hay-on-Wye\u000a      literature festival in June 2012 which had a sold out audience of 50.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    James Davidson's research has overturned a decades-old consensus about\u000a      the nature of sexual identity and same sex relations in Ancient Greece.\u000a      The research has been communicated to wider publics through print and\u000a      online media, popular publications and public events.

The research was published as\u000a      journal articles, book chapters, and two books intended for academic and\u000a      general audiences. Davidson's research over this 10-year period refuted\u000a      the dominant scholarly interpretation of sexual relations in Ancient\u000a      Greece. Davidson demonstrated that contemporary scholarship on sexuality\u000a      and sexual relations in classical Greece is the construct of modern\u000a      scholars influenced by the work of Michel Foucault and Kenneth Dover who\u000a      wrote predominantly in the 1970s and 1980s. These scholars depicted sexual\u000a      relations as relationships based on power in which the powerful\u000a      (penetrator) subjugated the vulnerable or weak (penetrated), whereby sex\u000a      was a zero-sum game with winners and losers. Davidson proposed an\u000a      alternative model of sexual morality and sexual practice in Greece which\u000a      took the discourse of same-sex eros (passionate love) more\u000a      seriously by reintegrating this supposedly marginal data into the most\u000a      central areas of Greek culture. Modern scholarship has over-sexualised\u000a      `Greek Love', thereby diminishing other elements of Greek homoeroticism,\u000a      such as the idealisation of the male body and love poetry. Finally,\u000a      Davidson argued that behind the amatory discourse there was sometimes\u000a      clear evidence for publicly formalized bilateral homosexual relationships.\u000a      These were characterized\/ caricatured as `marriages' by contemporaries and\u000a      Davidson's research has ultimately supported the research of both John\u000a      Boswell and Alan Bray that formalized same-sex troth-plighting is a very\u000a      long-standing feature of a number of European cultures.\u000a    The underpinning research was first published in Courtesans and\u000a        Fishcakes (1997), which examines what classical Athenians thought\u000a      and said about the pleasures of the flesh, namely eating, drinking, and\u000a      sex. Through this exploration of desire, Davidson sought to challenge the\u000a      prevailing notion of classical Athens as a phallocentric society which is\u000a      characterised by masculine mores of thought or behaviour.\u000a      Historians following Foucault imposed modern views of desire and sexuality\u000a      on Ancient Greek society. This has resulted in a simplistic binary\u000a      opposition of penetrator and penetrated, representing the powerful and\u000a      dominated. Rather, Davidson argued that sexuality was a slippery commodity\u000a      rooted in intricate social negotiations. Instead, it was the failure to\u000a      restrain desire which made it shameful. In this way, Davidson's work casts\u000a      a different light on Athenians' ideas of sexuality and sexual relations\u000a      which is more nuanced than the phallocentric interpretation.\u000a    In The Greeks and Greek Love (2007), Davidson built upon Courtesans\u000a        and Fishcakes to focus specifically on same sex relationships in\u000a      classical Greece, roughly 800-300BC. His research refuted the claims Dover\u000a      made in his 1978 book, Greek Homosexuality, in which he argued\u000a      that Athenians were obsessed with anal sex, which they saw as an act of\u000a      domination and humiliation, usually perpetrated by an older male on a\u000a      young boy. Davidson argues that this view of homosexual relations in\u000a      Ancient Greece is the projection of modern historians who have been\u000a      reluctant to imagine a world in which gay relationships involved\u000a      expressions of love and affection. By drawing on a broader range of\u000a      sources, such as myths, vase paintings, satirical plays, poems, and\u000a      architecture, Davidson argues for same-sex eros as a peculiar\u000a      nodal element in the society and culture in ancient Greece, with\u000a      wide-ranging and unpredictable ramifications.\u000a    Sexuality and sexual relations in Ancient Greece is a central area of\u000a      debate in Classics, ancient history, and gay studies. The importance of\u000a      Davidson's research on classical studies is evidenced by the overwhelming\u000a      reception of his work. Greek Love was described by the Journal of\u000a      Hellenic Studies as `a baroque masterpiece' and `jewel encrusted'. Courtesans\u000a        and Fishcakes was named as one of the International Books of the\u000a      Year in the Times Literary Supplement (1998) and a Breakthrough\u000a      Book in Classics (Lingua Franca, 2000). The book was subsequently\u000a      translated into German (1999) and Greek (2003). In 2009, the American\u000a      Philological Association conference hosted a panel on `Re-thinking\u000a      Homosexual Behaviour in Antiquity' which was organised in response to\u000a      academic developments in this area, including Davidson's 2001 Past\u000a        &amp; Present article.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7539","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research benefited learners and teachers in secondary level and adult\u000a      continuing education; activities building upon the research brought\u000a      economic benefits to museums in the USA, and changed the way in which\u000a      Pompeian social life was perceived by children and the general public.\u000a    Impact on Education\u000a    Cooley's research (2003) and (2004) has influenced the design and\u000a      delivery of Roman social history courses in schools, universities, and\u000a      Continuing Education departments.\u000a    \u000a      \u000aGCSE: The sourcebook features on reading lists for GCSE courses Roman\u000a        Life and Latin offered by OCR, and the Welsh Joint Education Committee\u000a        (WJEC)'s Level 2 certificate in Roman Civilisation. According to OCR,\u000a        from 2008 to 2013 there were 10,621 AS Level entries, and 10,244 A Level\u000a        entries both of which use the sourcebook. It is recommended in the\u000a        Teacher Resource Pack for GCSE Classical Civilisation (4020) Unit 3\u000a        offered by AQA (1263 students June 2011; 1579 June 2012) and for OCR\u000a        GCSE Classical Civilisation (J280; 18,913 entries 2008-13).\u000a        AS level: The sourcebook formed the basis for the OCR AS unit 6 for\u000a        Classical Civilisation `City Life in Roman Italy' (entry code F386)\u000a        designed in 2008. Using the sourcebook, the course developer compensated\u000a        for the previous over-emphasis on elite houses and villas, adjusting the\u000a        course towards a `more rounded view of life in Pompeii, in full\u000a        confidence that students and teachers would have easy access to the\u000a        relevant texts and building plans, and to very helpful contextual\u000a        commentary which would guide them in using and interpreting the\u000a        material....For example, part of the reason that the temple of Isis now\u000a        appears on the list of prescribed material is because the building\u000a        itself, its dedicatory inscription and the dedications from within the\u000a        precinct were all presented in detail in the sourcebook.' The course\u000a        designer also `took the opportunity to embed explicit references to the\u000a        sourcebook into the existing prescribed materials, and selected new\u000a        items partly on the basis of their coverage in the sourcebook.' The\u000a        sourcebook is the main resource for inscriptions in the unit (12 out of\u000a        15) and is prescribed reading for the building and tomb of Eumachia, the\u000a        tomb of Munatius Faustus and Naevoleia Tyche, the Amphitheatre, the\u000a        Painting of the amphitheatre riot, and the Temple of Isis.\u000a      \u000aHigher School Certificate: in New South Wales, Australia, Stage 6\u000a        (ages 17-18): since 2005, Cooley's books have supported the Ancient\u000a        History core unit `The Cities of Vesuvius - Pompeii and Herculaneum'.\u000a        Topics supported by the sourcebook include the archaeological and\u000a        historical methods used to investigate the site (ch. 1-3); the city plan\u000a        and streetscape; how to use archaeological evidence to learn about the\u000a        social hierarchy and local political life (ch. 6); and the architectural\u000a        features and uses of public buildings (sourcebook and textbook). In the\u000a        annotated resource list, Cooley (2003) is considered `An excellent\u000a        reference particularly on new research and interpretations over time.\u000a        Political influences and volcanology dealt with well. Very good for\u000a        Section 3 of the syllabus.' The sourcebook was described as having an\u000a        `Excellent section of primary sources for a wide range of aspects of\u000a        Pompeian life.' (both p. 70)\u000a      \u000aContinuing Education courses: the sourcebook formed the basis for\u000a        online Continuing Education courses at the University of Oxford (twice\u000a        yearly since 2009, enrolment typically 15- 20) and Royal Holloway,\u000a        University of London (since 2007, enrolment 3-4 annually). According to\u000a        Jo Berry, former course coordinator for `Pompeii and the Cities of the\u000a        Roman World':\u000a        `The Oxford course was completely designed around your sourcebook...[it]\u000a        helped to keep the students grounded in the evidence...I really felt\u000a        that by the end of each course the students were better at using\u000a        evidence to explain or justify their answers to questions.'\u000a    \u000a    Other educational activities include writing an article `Social climbers\u000a      at Herculaneum' for the magazine Omnibus (2013), produced by the\u000a      Joint Association of Classics Teachers (JACT). Targeted at sixth-formers\u000a      interested in the Classical World, this magazine has a circulation of\u000a      1,500-1,600 per issue. Cooley has delivered talks to students taking\u000a      subjects in Roman social history at Abingdon College (09.2010, 30\u000a      audience); Bancroft's Classical Society (03.2012, 20 audience); to the\u000a      general public at `Pompeii: Excavations Past and Present', Dept. of\u000a      Continuing Education, Oxford University (02.2008; 118 audience); and to\u000a      teachers at an OCR Inset day, British Museum (04.2013, 100+ audience). 98%\u000a      of the audience said that the lecture made them think about the\u000a      inscriptions in a new way (`Inscriptions are something I normally shy away\u000a      from so the lecture was fascinating and I hadn't even considered wax\u000a      tablets!'), and the same number said that the lecture would enhance their\u000a      visit to the exhibition.\u000a    Impact on museum visitors\u000a    Cooley was invited by the multi-national company Acoustiguide to\u000a      contribute to the audio-guide for the exhibition `A day in Pompeii'\u000a      organised by the Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di\u000a        Napoli e Pompei, and offered her expertise, speaking on 11 of the 26\u000a      stops on the guide (nos. 102, 104, 106, 112, 116, 118-22, 124), presenting\u000a      information on the city's social, cultural and economic composition, Roman\u000a      gods and goddesses, frescoes, furniture, and jewellery. Cooley was one of\u000a      four international academic experts who appear on the English guide for\u000a      adults. It toured 8 cities in the USA (2007-8; 2011-13) where the audio\u000a      guide was used:\u000a    \u000a      The Gulf Coast Exploreum Center, Mobile, Alabama (Mar-Jun 2007;\u000a        134,790 visitors)\u000a      The Science Museum of Minnesota, Minneapolis-St. Paul (Jun 2007-Jan\u000a        2008; 297,883 visitors)\u000a      Discovery Place, Charlotte, NC (Jul 2008-Jan 2009; 122,818 visitors)\u000a      San Diego Natural History Museum (Feb-Jun 2008; 131,000 visitors).\u000a      Discovery Times Square, New York (Mar-Sep 2011)\u000a      Museum of Science, Boston (Oct 2011-Feb 2012; 250,000 visitors)\u000a      Cincinnati Museum Center (Mar-Aug 2012; 132,000 visitors)\u000a      Denver Museum of Nature and Science (Sep 2012-Jan 2013; 171,980\u000a        visitors).\u000a    \u000a    At museums where the audio guide was rented separately, it made\u000a      considerable contributions to the institution's revenue from the\u000a      exhibition. For example, at Discovery Times Square, 39,375 audio-guides\u000a      were rented at $7 each (total $275,625). The audio-guides were available\u000a      to rent at $2 for adults and $1 for children at Discovery Place Charlotte,\u000a      contributing to the $8 million economic impact the exhibition created for\u000a      the region. The audio-guides were offered free to all exhibition visitors\u000a      at the Science Museum of Minnesota and the San Diego Natural History\u000a      Museum. In all instances, the audio-guide added value to the visitor\u000a      experience: it contextualised the exhibition in current academic research\u000a      presented in a manner accessible to non-experts, giving visitors a richer\u000a      and more nuanced understanding of the objects on display, and made for a\u000a      more enjoyable visit. The impact's reach is demonstrated by the nearly 1\u000a      million exhibition visitors who had access to academic research on\u000a      Pompeii.\u000a    Impact on children's publishing\u000a    Cooley was invited by the children's book publishers Scholastic to act as\u000a      historical advisor for My Story, Pompeii, part of a popular series\u000a      for 9-11 year olds. Her report to Scholastic provided the correct date of\u000a      the eruption of Vesuvius, corrected names, topography, and archaeological\u000a      details which stem from her research on Pompeii's archaeological history.\u000a      As a result, the author Sue Reid changed several of the characters' names\u000a      to suit their family and social situations and employed the new date of\u000a      the eruption. A historical note at the end of the novel explains that\u000a      recent research has re-dated the eruption. Since publication in 2008,\u000a      Scholastic has 15,000 books in print and in the market in the UK and a\u000a      further 10,000 in print and in the market in Australia and New Zealand.\u000a    Media Consultancy\u000a    Cooley was contacted by two media outlets developing television\u000a      programmes about Roman social history. She was consulted by an associate\u000a      producer from Associated Producers (Toronto, Canada) who produced the\u000a      series `Secrets of Christianity (Decoding the Ancients)', which aired in\u000a      the US (History Channel, 2010), Canada (History Television, 2011), and 9\u000a      other countries (2011) . Her research about the `inscriptions in Pompeii\u000a      that indicate a Jewish presence' fed into episode 3, `Vesuvius and the\u000a      Fear of God'. Cooley was also interviewed by telephone by a\u000a      producer-director at Lion Television for the series `Meet the Romans'\u000a      (BBC2, April 2012). She was asked for input into `how we could use\u000a      funerary monuments and other epigraphic evidence to let us into different\u000a      areas of the social history of Ancient Rome'. Viewing figures for the\u000a      programme were 1.97 million (w\/e 22 April), 1.8 million (w\/e 29 April) and\u000a      2.9 million (w\/e 6 May).\u000a    Public Impact\u000a    Cooley has communicated her research to non-academic audiences: her web\u000a      article for Warwick's Knowledge Centre (June 2013; 154 unique page views)\u000a      reviewed the British Museum exhibition, `Life and Death at Pompeii and\u000a      Herculaneum' (Summer 2013). She has given talks to Classical Association\u000a      branches at Roehampton and South-West London (03.2013; 20 audience) and\u000a      Southampton (05.2009, 20 audience); Three Counties Ancient History Society\u000a      (Upton Snodsbury, 04.2008 and 04.2011, 20 audience); and to Friends of\u000a      Alcester Museum (10.2012, 40 audience).\u000a    Further evidence of the research's reach and significance is demonstrated\u000a      by the number of copies sold: Pompeii (2003) has sold 451 copies (figures\u000a      from 2009) and the sourcebook 7562 (pbk), 195 (hbk) and 312 (e-book)\u000a      copies worldwide during the assessment period. Its popularity has prompted\u000a      the publisher to commission a second edition (2013c), which includes\u000a      recent finds from Pompeii and source material from Herculaneum. The\u000a      textbook was featured in The Times Book Club (17.4.2010). It is\u000a      recommended by the company Andante Travels for tourists on their Campanian\u000a      tour (http:\/\/bit.ly\/15v18xT).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Alison Cooley's research has changed how Pompeii is taught in schools:\u000a      her sourcebook allowed inscriptions to become embedded in GCSE- and\u000a      AS-Level Roman history modules and in Continuing Education courses.

The sourcebook makes the documents accessible to an\u000a        English-speaking readership for the first time: most of them were\u000a        published only in specialist epigraphic corpora without translation and\u000a        with commentary only in Latin.

In each\u000a      instance, analyses of\u000a      contemporary responses to antiquity have inspired individuals to\u000a      reappraise their methods,\u000a      perspectives and practices or to use the research as a springboard for\u000a      their own interrogative\u000a      analyses, thus leading to new ways of thinking and modes of expression at\u000a      personal and\u000a      professional levels.\u000a    (1) Film-makers: In her 2009 work on Alexander (2004), a\u000a      biopic by Hollywood director Oliver\u000a      Stone, Joanna Paul traces the film's production environment, its generic\u000a      appropriation of `new epic'\u000a      conventions and its relationship with older works, and the narrative\u000a      structure it imposes upon the\u000a      biography of Alexander the Great. In the process, she evaluates the\u000a      success of the film, and\u000a      wonders `what would have been done differently had the director listened\u000a      to Aristotle as carefully\u000a      as Alexander did' (p. 28). Paul argues that the philosopher's proposition\u000a      that epic and tragedy\u000a      should be shaped around `a single action, not a single hero' could have\u000a      been applied successfully\u000a      to this cinematic epic. This idea had direct impact upon Oliver Stone. In\u000a      a written response that\u000a      forms the epilogue to the edited collection featuring Paul's work\u000a      (Greenland &amp; Cartledge, 2009), he\u000a      remarks firstly on the perspicuity of her observations &#8212; `Dr. Paul perhaps\u000a      gets to the nut of it in my\u000a      mind' &#8212; and then proceeds to `follow(s) the lead given by Dr. Paul'\u000a      (p.343) to imagine how his\u000a      revised Alexander could be read with a `single action' at its\u000a      core. He states explicitly that `Dr Paul,\u000a      in pointing to Aristotle's \"single action,\" has opened my eyes to what I\u000a      missed at the time' (p. 348).\u000a      The director acquired new understandings of his own work as a\u000a        film-maker and story-teller, and its\u000a        possibilities, by engaging with Paul's research. (See Section 5 (1))\u000a    (2) Media practitioners: Fiona Hobden's research on ancient world\u000a      documentaries provided the\u000a      background, stimulus and framework for the Documenting Antiquity workshop,\u000a      which met for the\u000a      first time in July 2013. The workshop, the first of its type ever to be\u000a      held in the UK, is a mixed group\u000a      comprising commissioners, directors, and producers from the primary UK\u000a      broadcasters (BBC, ITV)\u000a      and production houses (Lion TV, Tern TV, MediaLab UK) and academics from\u000a      Classics, Ancient\u000a      History and Media Studies. With its purpose to examine the character,\u000a      effects, and future directions\u000a      of ancient world documentaries, two journal articles by Hobden (2013a,\u000a      2013b) made logical\u000a      starting points. During discussion of `processes, priorities,\u000a      practicalities, and purposes' and `telling\u000a      stories', programme-makers discussed the use of archaeological artefacts\u000a      to narrate and\u000a      substantiate ancient history, the construction of presenters as reliably\u000a      academic, and what makes\u000a      a good (and bad) programme about antiquity - key ideas in the\u000a      pre-circulated research. The\u000a      impact of this discussion on participants was recognized in feedback. Filtered\u000a        through the\u000a        workshop, Hobden's research provided a prism through which members of\u000a        the media community\u000a        could articulate and interrogate their own experiences and practices.\u000a      It thereby played a role in\u000a        their personal and professional development. (See Section 5 (2) and\u000a      (3), below.)\u000a    (3) Theatre producers: Members of the theatre community have also\u000a      benefited from Liverpool\u000a      research. The impact of Tom Harrison's work on the creative practice of\u000a      Alison Richards, an\u000a      Australian theatre artist and practice-based researcher at Monash\u000a      University, is witnessed in her\u000a      experimental performance paper `X Marks the Spot' (22 August 2010,\u000a      Malthouse Theatre,\u000a      Melbourne). The performance took place at a multi-disciplinary conference\u000a      entitled `\"From Sappho\u000a      to X\": Classics, Performance, Reception', before an audience of 120\u000a      theatre professionals,\u000a      Humanities scholars, and members of the public. Richards first encountered\u000a      Harrison's research\u000a      whilst scoping out Classical scholarship on the relationship between\u000a      ancient and modern. As\u000a      certified in both the script and Richard's written testimonial, Harrison's\u000a        ideas and methods directly\u000a        influenced both the spoken content and physical shape of the resulting\u000a        performance.\u000a    i) Spoken quotations from Harrison's 2008 paper regarding the mutual\u000a      comprehension of ancient\u000a      and modern empires, the potential of classical reception studies to expose\u000a      ideology in\u000a      ancient\/modern discourses, and his question `can an understanding of\u000a      ancient imperialisms cast\u000a      light on contemporary experience?' follow immediately upon observations\u000a      regarding modern\u000a      appropriations of the Classical, including the perverse priority in\u000a      Australia of a `Western legacy of\u000a      performance', when the country's population originates globally and its\u000a      geopolitical alignment is\u000a      with Asia; all the while the speaker builds her own arena of ancient\u000a      imperial ambition drawn from\u000a      Herodotus in sand (pp.3-4). Harrison's observations are directly\u000a      integrated into the performance\u000a      event, so as to inform its particular consideration, through performance,\u000a      of the `potential\u000a      contribution of contemporary theatre theory and performance practice to\u000a      Classical reception\u000a      studies' (p. 2). Later in the piece, his assertion of Herodotus'\u000a      multivocality and resultant ambiguity\u000a      on matters of power are a particular inspiration for thinking about this\u000a      theoretical issue (p. 5: `I am\u000a      particularly interested in ... claimed by Harrison on Herodotus' behalf').\u000a      The remainder of Richard's\u000a      piece emulates this multivocality by resurrecting and re-scripting female\u000a      voices from the Classical\u000a      past (p.7). (See Section 5 (4) and (5), below.)\u000a    ii) Harrison's introduction of a family photograph into his analysis of\u000a      modern imperialism inspired\u000a      Richards to use an atlas belonging to her grandmother as a prop during her\u000a      own analysis: a\u000a      physical mapping of ancient empires in sand on-stage.

On the other, fresh interpretation\u000a      of the interaction\u000a      between ancient historiography and modern imperialisms permits the\u000a      appropriation of these\u000a      interpretations into experimental theatrical work that re-envisions modern\u000a      engagements with the\u000a      Classical world. Our work thus not only reflects upon but shapes modern\u000a      receptions of antiquity,\u000a      enabling new ways of thinking amongst media professionals and inspiring\u000a      innovative forms of\u000a      artistic expression. There are three strands of underpinning research.\u000a    (1) Analyses of cinematic receptions of antiquity by Joanna Paul\u000a      (Lecturer in Classical Studies,\u000a      2006-9; J.P. Postgate Early Career Fellow in Classics, 2009-11) offer a\u000a      nuanced reappraisal of the\u000a      changing and malleable role of the Classical world - its literature, art\u000a      and history - in film by\u000a      identifying generic, production and cultural factors that influence its\u000a      varying depictions. The method\u000a      and value of this work, which have also informed her 2013 monograph\u000a      (section 3 (ii)), are\u000a      exemplified in her 2009 treatment of Alexander (dir. O. Stone,\u000a      2004), which interrogates the film's\u000a      content, structures, and themes through the prism of cinema's epic\u000a      tradition. It demonstrates how\u000a      the film grapples with the historiographical challenges attendant upon\u000a      Alexander, drawing\u000a      particular attention to the problems associated with creating a narrative\u000a      of his life. Paul's work\u000a      enhances understanding of Alexander's place within the modern imagination,\u000a      of the film as a\u000a      reception of Alexander and a modern epic, and of the new character and\u000a      socio-political contexts of\u000a      the recently reprised genre.\u000a    (2) Research by Fiona Hobden (Lecturer in Greek Culture, 2003-11; Senior\u000a      Lecturer in Greek\u000a      Culture, 2011-present) on television documentaries about the ancient\u000a        world, conducted from\u000a      2011 onwards, explores the hows, whys and effects of this distinctive mode\u000a      of historiography. With\u000a      particular attention to audio-visual and narrative strategies, it reveals\u000a      the rhetorical synergies\u000a      between setting and story. Her work draws particular attention to how\u000a      archaeology on-screen -\u000a      both the physical remains of antiquity and their excavation\/analysis -\u000a      acts persuasively to\u000a      authorize statements about antiquity.

The Liverpool Ancient History Teachers' Summer School (now extended\u000d\u000a      into a nationwide programme of courses) is a unique programme of CPD for\u000d\u000a      school-teachers delivered by academic staff, that provides in-depth\u000d\u000a      introductions to core topics in the GCSE, AS and A-level curriculum. In\u000d\u000a      sessions dedicated to `Herodotus', `Ancient Persia' and `Alexander' in\u000d\u000a      August 2012 and July 2013, the 31 participants were introduced to recent\u000d\u000a      Liverpool research: namely, Tuplin's work on Persian exploitation of the\u000d\u000a      empire (as evidenced in the correspondence of the satrap Arshama),\u000d\u000a      Harrison's work on Herodotean historiography, his critique of the broad\u000d\u000a      contours of recent Achaemenid scholarship (especially in relation to the\u000d\u000a      themes of tolerance and openness) and his analysis of the background of\u000d\u000a      the Alexander tradition in earlier Greek traditions on Persia.\u000d\u000a    Participants subsequently commented on the ways in which the sessions had\u000d\u000a      changed their understanding and the experience of the pupils they teach\u000d\u000a      (corroborating source 1a). They spoke, for example, of how the sessions\u000d\u000a      had `deepen[ed their] knowledge of the subject, of how they felt `much\u000d\u000a      more enlightened', and that they felt they had `benefitted greatly from\u000d\u000a      their [Christopher Tuplin and Tom Harrison's] expertise and insights',\u000d\u000a      that `the topic [of Persia] really did come to life for me', and that\u000d\u000a      Harrison's `incredible grasp on the nuances of the sources for (and\u000d\u000a      scholarship about) the Achaemenid Empire has clarified numerous confusions\u000d\u000a      I would otherwise have passed on'. In particular, participants commented\u000d\u000a      on how the sessions had been useful `in re-thinking Herodotus', `for\u000d\u000a      considering the perspectives of the Persian Empire', or in underlining the\u000d\u000a      view `that there is another side to Xerxes'. The sessions were also\u000d\u000a      credited with `[unveiling] a plethora of new materials ... to strengthen\u000d\u000a      the source base available to pupils', `particularly epigraphical sources'\u000d\u000a      and graphics. Participants also commented on how the sessions had prompted\u000d\u000a      `ideas for production of tasks to be used in my classes, and different\u000d\u000a      methods of approaching my subjects', that the course had made them realise\u000d\u000a      that `there is not just one correct answer and it is the skills that the\u000d\u000a      students need rather than the answers', that they had changed the\u000d\u000a      questions that they would study as a result of the sessions, and that\u000d\u000a      overall the effect of the sessions would be to `[improve] grades and\u000d\u000a      educational experiences'.\u000d\u000a    b. Liverpool's development of research-based CPD for teachers of Ancient\u000d\u000a      History has also had a marked effect on the uptake of Ancient History as a\u000d\u000a      school subject, and on the thinking of the one UK awarding body who offer\u000d\u000a      it as a subject, the Oxford, Cambridge and RSA awarding body. The Chair of\u000d\u000a      Examiners for Classics attributes a significant aspect of the increase in\u000d\u000a      the uptake of Ancient History to the effect of the courses based on\u000d\u000a      Liverpool research (corroborating source 1b) suggesting, e.g. that they\u000d\u000a      were instrumental in a 30% rise in the number of centres entering for the\u000d\u000a      GCSE from 2012 to 2013 (either through our directly persuading schools to\u000d\u000a      take up Ancient History or through supporting them to do so). She also\u000d\u000a      credits the courses with raising the profile of the subject within the\u000d\u000a      wider history community, with encouraging OCR to engage directly with\u000d\u000a      Higher Education Institutions in the development of the curriculum, and to\u000d\u000a      ensure that the development of qualifications (especially in relation to\u000d\u000a      Persia) `reflect[s] the most recent academic thinking'.\u000d\u000a    c. The impact of Harrison's research on how ancient Persia is taught in\u000d\u000a      schools is extended by his contribution to Teaching History\u000d\u000a      (`Polychronicon: Interpreting the Persian Wars', 2013, pp. 36-7). Adopting\u000d\u000a      an explicitly pedagogical perspective, and with an accompanying piece by\u000d\u000a      an experienced teacher-trainer suggesting strategies for translating\u000d\u000a      Harrison's research into the classroom, the article poses fundamental\u000d\u000a      questions about how ancient Persia should be studied, and presents varying\u000d\u000a      perspectives on key themes such as the tolerance of the empire, its\u000d\u000a      relationship to its subjects, and the use of Greek sources in\u000d\u000a      reconstructing Persian history. As of September 2013, 68 secondary school\u000d\u000a      teachers had downloaded this piece through the Historical Association\u000d\u000a      website, in addition to others who accessed it through the print version &#8212;\u000d\u000a      with a circulation of c.3,000, and an additional 900 individuals who\u000d\u000a      accessed the whole journal online (corroborating source 1c). Additionally,\u000d\u000a      Harrison's perspective on ancient Persia formed the basis for an article\u000d\u000a      (`The Persian Empire. Myths and Realities') in the BBC History\u000d\u000a        Magazine (August 2011), reaching an estimated\u000a        readership of c. 72,000 (2011 circulation figures published by\u000d\u000a      InPublishing).\u000d\u000a    d. School teachers and students are also the beneficiaries of Harrison's\u000d\u000a      research on the Persian empire, Greek-Persian relations, and Herodotus via\u000d\u000a      the Historical Association Podcasted History project. According to\u000d\u000a      statistics provided by the Historical Association, between April and\u000d\u000a      September 2013, 355 secondary school teachers, 902 secondary students, and\u000d\u000a      147 other individuals have downloaded his podcasts (corroborating source\u000d\u000a      1c).\u000d\u000a    2. Impacts on the public understanding of Ancient History outside the\u000d\u000a      Classroom\u000d\u000a      Tuplin's and Harrison's research on ancient Persia has also had an impact\u000d\u000a      on the understanding of people learning about the ancient world outside of\u000d\u000a      formal education, internationally. This is achieved through the\u000d\u000a      dissemination of their ideas through other public-facing platforms, and\u000d\u000a      through Harrison's influence on a prominent popular historian with a\u000d\u000a      worldwide readership in the hundreds of thousands\u000d\u000a    a. The Reading Odyssey project is a US non-profit organisation that\u000d\u000a      provides on-line educational resources of `intellectually curious' adults.\u000d\u000a      `The Persian Version', a live Jan. 2011 `webinar', since published online\u000d\u000a      as a podcast, translates issues fundamental to Harrison's research on the\u000d\u000a      historiographical tradition of the Persian Wars (esp. the difficulties of\u000d\u000a      accessing a `Persian version') into an accessible discussion of the battle\u000d\u000a      of Marathon. On live transmission, the webinar had 1,200 participants\u000d\u000a      across seven countries across Europe and the Americas. Since then, it has\u000d\u000a      been downloaded approximately 1,000 times, many in classroom settings with\u000d\u000a      audiences of 20 to 30 people (corroborating source 2a).\u000d\u000a    b. Harrison's wider work has reached even wider audiences through the\u000d\u000a      mediation of Tom Holland's popular histories. Holland credits Harrison's\u000d\u000a      distinctive treatment of Greek representations of Persia in his\u000d\u000a      `ground-breaking' Emptiness of Asia (Harrison 2000a) as playing `the\u000d\u000a      key role' in developing his understanding of Athenian perceptions of\u000d\u000a      Persia, ideas which underpinned Holland's 2005 book, Persian Fire.\u000d\u000a      This work has since been translated into 16 languages, and has sold\u000d\u000a      155,000 copies in the UK alone, and around half a million copies\u000d\u000a      worldwide. His new translation of Herodotus' Histories (2013) for\u000d\u000a      non-specialist audiences has similarly taken Harrison's research to\u000d\u000a      non-specialist audiences, not just in print but through its serialisation\u000d\u000a      in The Guardian and Telegraph newspapers, and radio\u000d\u000a      programmes on Radio 3 and 5 Live. Holland credits his own persuasive\u000d\u000a      `case' for Herodotus `in no small part' to the influence of Harrison's\u000d\u000a      interpretations (corroborating source 2b).\u000d\u000a    c. The exhibition (`Thus Arshama speaks') associated with Tuplin's\u000d\u000a      project on the correspondence of the Persian satrap Arshama presented\u000d\u000a      central themes of Tuplin's commentary on the Arshama letters, for example\u000d\u000a      their value for understanding the rationing of journeys within the empire,\u000d\u000a      Arshama's epistolary practice, and his focus on maximising profit from his\u000d\u000a      estates. The exhibition is estimated to have reached an audience of 19,500\u000d\u000a      in the Bodleian Library proscholium between 30 June and 16 July 2011\u000d\u000a      (corroborating source 2c, d).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research on the historian Herodotus, the history of the Achaemenid\u000d\u000a      Persian empire, and the complex relationship between Greek and Persian\u000d\u000a      worlds in the Classical period has had an impact in two main ways:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Teaching and learning of Ancient History in UK Classrooms\u000d\u000a        Working with partner institutions, such as the Oxford Cambridge and RSA\u000d\u000a        awarding body (OCR), the Historical Association and the Reading Odyssey\u000d\u000a        project, it has:\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a        contributed to the professional development of secondary teachers of\u000d\u000a          Ancient History;\u000d\u000a        improved the educational experience of secondary students\u000d\u000a          (indirectly through CPD, and directly through the provision of\u000d\u000a          resources),\u000d\u000a        shaped the awarding body's thinking on future changes to the\u000d\u000a          curriculum,\u000d\u000a        increased the uptake of Ancient History as a school subject in the\u000d\u000a          UK.\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a      Public understanding of Ancient History outside the Classroom\u000d\u000a        Through popular publications, exhibitions, webinars, and through\u000d\u000a        influence on popular historians, it has:\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a        extended and deepened public understanding of the ancient world and\u000d\u000a        its interfaces with the present.\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Liverpool\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Liverpool (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Liverpool","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10006842}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aHarrison, T., 2000a, The Emptiness of Asia: Aeschylus' Persians\u000d\u000a        and the History of the Fifth Century, London: Duckworth.

His 2011 monograph, Writing\u000d\u000a        Ancient Persia particularly brings out continuities in the history\u000d\u000a      of scholarship on Persia since the nineteenth century, questions the\u000d\u000a      recent emphasis on the tolerance and openness of Persian imperialism, and\u000d\u000a      on minimising the role of violence and exploitation. He has also explored\u000d\u000a      how ancient narratives of Alexander the Great reflect Persian royal\u000d\u000a      ideology and its representation in earlier Greek sources (Harrison, 2009).\u000d\u000a    ii) Harrison's work on Greek historiography has focussed on\u000d\u000a      developing a contextual understanding of Herodotus' Histories, in\u000d\u000a      particular the ways in which they are informed by religious assumptions,\u000d\u000a      contemporary views of geography or the nature of language (for example,\u000d\u000a      Harrison, 2000b). His work has also illuminated aspects of the Greek\u000d\u000a      representation of foreign peoples, arguing strongly, for example,\u000d\u000a      for a jingoistic reading of Aeschylus' Persians and for the play's\u000d\u000a      reflection of Athenian democratic and imperial ideology (Harrison, 2000a).\u000d\u000a    iii) Across his career, Christopher Tuplin (University of Liverpool\u000d\u000a      Professor of Ancient History, 1976-present) has illuminated understanding\u000d\u000a      of central aspects of the Achaemenid Persian empire. His vast\u000d\u000a      scholarly output has been fundamental to understanding the realities of,\u000d\u000a      for example, the administration of the empire, Persian military\u000d\u000a      organisation, travel within the empire, and the empire's impact on its\u000d\u000a      subject peoples (see especially Tuplin 2010, 2011). Since 2010 he has\u000d\u000a      coordinated the AHRC-funded `Arshama project' (with John Ma, Fellow and\u000d\u000a      Tutor, University Lecturer (CUF) in Ancient History, University of\u000d\u000a      Oxford), a collaboration designed to provide a new edition and analysis of\u000d\u000a      the archive of correspondence of a Persian satrap, a crucial source for\u000d\u000a      understanding the character of Persian provincial administration\u000d\u000a      (including its exploitative aspect).

In 2010, Lane Fox recorded 14 lectures on Alexander for\u000d\u000a      the main publishers of\u000d\u000a      cassette teaching systems in the USA.[i] In that year,\u000d\u000a      he also talked on Alexander for the BBC TV\u000d\u000a      World version of their international series Ancient Worlds (an\u000d\u000a      enlarged version of the original UK\u000d\u000a      series presented by Richard Miles) and for Neil MacGregor's BBC Radio 4\u000d\u000a      series History of the\u000d\u000a        World In 100 Objects (Episode 31: Coin with head of Alexander); his\u000d\u000a      contribution was then adapted\u000d\u000a      and included in MacGregor's best-selling book. In 2011, Lane Fox\u000d\u000a      contributed to the in-house\u000d\u000a      British Museum video for the major exhibition Afghanistan: Crossroads\u000d\u000a        of the Ancient World,\u000d\u000a      discussing the impact of Alexander and his Successors.

Lane Fox also had a strong\u000d\u000a      impact on the making of a\u000d\u000a      separate historian's disk accompanying a Blu-Ray release of a new version\u000d\u000a      of the film. This film,\u000d\u000a      produced by Gary Leva (Leva FilmWorks), involves interviews with Lane Fox\u000d\u000a      and five other\u000d\u000a      historians in the UK and US, all recruited by Lane Fox.\u000d\u000a    The Ashmolean exhibition Heracles to Alexander the Great offered\u000d\u000a      considerable cultural and\u000d\u000a      pedagogical benefits to its visitors (43,464 people in all) and aided the\u000d\u000a      positive economic impact of\u000d\u000a      the University (tourists who visit Oxford each year spend on average &#163;65\u000d\u000a      each, supporting 13,700\u000d\u000a      jobs).[1] During the course of the exhibition, 4,050\u000d\u000a      copies of the exhibition catalogue were sold (it\u000d\u000a      was reprinted twice) and 5,763 copies of the exhibition guide book (it was\u000d\u000a      reprinted three times).\u000d\u000a      The exhibition implemented the vision of the Ashmolean Museum &#8212; `Opening\u000d\u000a      minds to the joy of\u000d\u000a      learning' &#8212; with cutting-edge graphics, accessible texts, and dramatic\u000d\u000a      design effects (e.g. the\u000d\u000a      funeral pyre of Queen Eurydice and the lifesize reproduction of the\u000d\u000a      `hunting frieze' from the tomb of\u000d\u000a      Philip II). By providing a strong visual and material background to the\u000d\u000a      family of Alexander the\u000d\u000a      Great, it helped stir interest in the art, archaeology, and history of\u000d\u000a      regions in the periphery of the\u000d\u000a      Greek world for the period between 1200 to 350 BC, thus opening up new\u000d\u000a      opportunities for study\u000d\u000a      and the dissemination of knowledge (e.g. Art as Power): one Oxfordshire\u000d\u000a      school pupil commented\u000d\u000a      that the exhibition `gave me a new insight into Hellenistic rulership and\u000d\u000a      fired my interest in the\u000d\u000a      workings of the Classical World'.[2] This cultural\u000d\u000a      benefit was reinforced by a programme of lectures\u000d\u000a      and tours. Galanakis was responsible for delivering public lectures and\u000d\u000a      around 50 tours. There was\u000d\u000a      also a series of 10 public lectures by Oxford academics and invited\u000d\u000a      speakers (attendance for each\u000d\u000a      lecture was between 80 and 120 people).\u000d\u000a    The benefits of increased historical knowledge about Macedon and about\u000d\u000a      the process of historical\u000d\u000a      research were promoted by the wide media coverage that the exhibition\u000d\u000a      received.[ii] Before it\u000d\u000a      opened, it was a recommendation in the local, national, and international\u000d\u000a      press, and called by Dr\u000d\u000a      Kottaridi `the most important Greek cultural event in many years'. The\u000d\u000a      exhibition itself was widely\u000d\u000a      reviewed in the UK and abroad: rated a `must see' by Bettany Hughes, one\u000d\u000a      of the `Five Best Art\u000d\u000a      Shows' by The Independent and the `Show of the Summer' by the Sunday\u000d\u000a        Telegraph; it received\u000d\u000a      full page reviews in German papers, and was recommended by the Wall\u000d\u000a        Street Journal Europe as\u000d\u000a      possibly `your only chance to see' the new discoveries. Lane Fox also\u000d\u000a      wrote a major review of the\u000d\u000a      exhibition in the Financial Times. The exhibition was also\u000d\u000a      featured in the BBC4 series Guilty\u000d\u000a        Pleasures: Luxury in the Ancient Greek and Medieval worlds presented\u000d\u000a      by Michael Scott (June\u000d\u000a      2011). Throughout, much attention was paid to Lane Fox's reaction to the\u000d\u000a      new archaeological\u000d\u000a      discoveries in the context of his long-standing research expertise on\u000d\u000a      Macedonia. The Guardian\u000d\u000a      critic Maeve Kennedy's online article (6\/4\/11) focused on Lane Fox' speech\u000d\u000a      at the press opening.\u000d\u000a      European TV and press also carried extracts from his speech, and they have\u000d\u000a      been replayed\u000d\u000a      persistently in Greece since.[iii] Quotations from his\u000d\u000a      speech were also used in France to promote\u000d\u000a      the Louvre Mac&#233;doine exhibition, Nov. 2011.\u000d\u000a    Further cultural and pedagogical benefits arising from the exhibition\u000d\u000a      were the opportunity to\u000d\u000a      promote the financial support for the Ashmolean Museum and to support\u000d\u000a      cultural interactions\u000d\u000a      between Britain and Greece. Owing to the success of the exhibition, Lane\u000d\u000a      Fox was invited to give\u000d\u000a      the main speech at the dinner of Ashmolean donors in November 2011. Lane\u000d\u000a      Fox also gave the\u000d\u000a      main speech to open the exhibition before the Greek Ambassador, the UK\u000d\u000a      Minister of Higher\u000d\u000a      Education, and about 400 other invitees.\u000d\u000a    The exhibition had a particularly strong cultural and political impact in\u000d\u000a      Greece. In July 2008, when\u000d\u000a      the exhibition was first planned, Lane Fox and Kottaridi were the major\u000d\u000a      contributors to a 60-\u000d\u000a      minute television documentary at Vergina made by Photis Constantinidis\u000d\u000a      that was shown on Greek\u000d\u000a      TV. There was very strong coverage of the Ashmolean exhibition in Greece:\u000d\u000a      e.g. Kathimerini\u000d\u000a      (17\/4\/11).[iii] The Ashmolean exhibition was also the\u000d\u000a      impetus for the conservation of many of the\u000d\u000a      new finds from Vergina. The publicity created by the exhibition has helped\u000d\u000a      to promote the case for\u000d\u000a      a new Museum at Vergina to display the new finds (almost 90% of the\u000d\u000a      objects displayed in the\u000d\u000a      exhibition are now back in storage); as yet this ambition has not been\u000d\u000a      realised owing to the\u000d\u000a      financial crisis in Greece.\u000d\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Oxford scholars on ancient Macedon has played a significant\u000d\u000a      role in promoting public\u000d\u000a      knowledge of this important kingdom [text removed for publication].

He has argued against the\u000d\u000a      attempts by P. Briant\u000d\u000a      to align Alexander's style of kingship with a distinctively Achaemenid\u000d\u000a      Persian model. Particularly\u000d\u000a      notable are the arguments presented in his contributions to Brill's\u000d\u000a        Companion to Ancient Macedon,\u000d\u000a      including the `Introduction', which incorporates his research into new\u000d\u000a      archaeological investigations\u000d\u000a      of the palace complex of Philip II at Aegae (evidence that is presented\u000d\u000a      for the first time in the Brill's\u000d\u000a        Companion) and his arguments for the dating of the royal tombs at\u000d\u000a      Aegae to the time of Philip II\u000d\u000a      rather than that of Philip III. This research (based on five visits to\u000d\u000a      Vergina between 1996 and 2008)\u000d\u000a      demonstrates the scope of Philip II's centralisation of royal power, and\u000d\u000a      so of Alexander's debt to\u000d\u000a      his father. It suggests that Alexander's success in making Macedon one of\u000d\u000a      the superpowers of the\u000d\u000a      ancient world (stretching from the Adriatic Sea and the Balkan peninsula\u000d\u000a      to the Indus Valley and\u000d\u000a      the Persian Gulf) was the culmination of a much earlier process.\u000d\u000a      Underlying Lane Fox's research\u000d\u000a      into these various areas is the argument that the Macedonian monarchy was\u000d\u000a      Hellenic.\u000d\u000a    Lane Fox's research on the structures and material remains of the\u000d\u000a      Macedonian monarchy and his\u000d\u000a      arguments for its Hellenic status were combined with further new\u000d\u000a      archaeological research in\u000d\u000a      Heracles to Alexander the Great, a major international exhibition\u000d\u000a      at the Ashmolean Museum, 7\u000d\u000a      April - 29 August 2011, and in the accompanying catalogue.

The exhibition displayed, for the first time anywhere, many\u000d\u000a      important objects discovered\u000d\u000a      at Vergina over the last 30 years (including a gold wreath found in 2008).\u000d\u000a      While the archaeological\u000d\u000a      investigations at Vergina were not conducted by Oxford researchers,\u000d\u000a      research for the exhibition\u000d\u000a      itself was carried out between November 2010 to April 2011 collaboratively\u000d\u000a      by three Oxford-based\u000d\u000a      researchers (Walker, Galanakis, Stamatopoulou) and Dr Kottaridi. This\u000d\u000a      research included: sourcing\u000d\u000a      and studying the objects; visiting Vergina (the archaeological site, the\u000d\u000a      museum, the conservation\u000d\u000a      laboratory, and the storerooms); conserving the objects (more than half of\u000d\u000a      the objects were\u000d\u000a      conserved for the very first time because of the Ashmolean exhibition);\u000d\u000a      editing the catalogue;\u000d\u000a      preparing the layout and design of the exhibition; writing the texts (for\u000d\u000a      the catalogue, the exhibition\u000d\u000a      guide, and the labels in the exhibition itself). More than 2,500 objects\u000d\u000a      discovered in the royal tombs\u000d\u000a      and the palace at Aegae &#8212; the results of cutting-edge archaeological\u000d\u000a      research across a wide range\u000d\u000a      of subjects connected with the capital and the royal family &#8212; went on\u000d\u000a      display; these were grouped in\u000d\u000a      552 entries in the exhibition catalogue. The research embodied in the\u000d\u000a      exhibition as a whole\u000d\u000a      combined Lane Fox's historical analysis with the results of the detailed\u000d\u000a      investigation of new\u000d\u000a      archaeological evidence by Dr Kottaridi and the Oxford team.\u000d\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000d\u000a    The key researchers are: Mr Robin Lane Fox, Fellow and Tutor in Ancient\u000d\u000a      History, New College\u000d\u000a      [text removed for publication]; Dr Susan Walker, Keeper of Antiquities,\u000d\u000a      Ashmolean Museum; Dr\u000d\u000a      Yannis Galanakis, Sackler Junior Research Fellow, and Curator for the\u000d\u000a      Aegean Collections and\u000d\u000a      the Sir Arthur Evans Archive (2007-2012); Dr Maria Stamatopoulou,\u000d\u000a      University Lecturer in\u000d\u000a      Classical Art and Archaeology.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8849","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1522867","Name":"Kazakhstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Enriching cultural life and expanding public understanding:\u000a      The main cultural and pedagogical benefit of the Oxford research on Euboea\u000a      lies in the increased\u000a      historical understanding of a formative period of Greek history and of the\u000a      complexity of intercultural\u000a      relations between Greece and the Near East.

Her work has made the local population\u000a      understand better the\u000a      importance of the site and their local history. Lemos collaborates with\u000a      the Lefkandi cultural society\u000a      in organising lectures and exhibitions on the history of the area to raise\u000a      awareness of the local\u000a      history and protect the archaeological site. In September 2010, the local\u000a      community was invited to\u000a      an open day with a guided tour of the site and a lecture attended by at\u000a      least 600 people; at this\u000a      event Lemos was awarded a medal by the local authorities for her\u000a      contribution to the conservation\u000a      and the history of the area. The popular Greek novelist Christos\u000a      Chomenidis, whose 2010 novel\u000a      Logia ptera (Flying Words) features Lefkandi, has also\u000a      appeared at these local events. In 2011,\u000a      Lemos displayed in the village of Lefkandi an exhibition of photographs of\u000a      the excavations that had\u000a      previously been on display in the outreach room at the Stelios Ioannou\u000a      School for Research in\u000a      Classical and Byzantine Studies in Oxford. Lemos' large-scale excavation\u000a      also includes the\u000a      participation of many students, including students from outside Oxford who\u000a      have gained\u000a      pedagogical benefits from her study seasons.\u000a    Museums\u000a      Finds from Lefkandi are on display at the Museum of Eretria, which in 2012\u000a      had 8832 adult and\u000a      5472 school visitors. Lemos displayed her Lefkandi research at a major\u000a      exhibition on Eretria, held\u000a      first in Athens at the National Museum and later in Switzerland.[i]\u000a      Lefkandi finds and text by Lemos\u000a      were published in the catalogues produced for the exhibition in Greek,\u000a      French and German.[ii]\u000a      Lane Fox also wrote a major review of the Athens exhibition for the Financial\u000a        Times (3\/6\/2010).\u000a      There is also a section on Al Mina at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford (1.2\u000a      million visitors per\u000a      year) that puts pottery finds from the site in the context of\u000a      Mediterranean networks. Other\u000a      exhibitions to which items from the Lefkandi excavations have been loaned\u000a      include: `Greeks and\u000a      Phoenicians in the Crossroads of the Mediterranean Sea', Museum of\u000a      Thessaloniki (December\u000a      2011-September 2012); `Princesses of the Mediterranean Sea in the Dawn of\u000a      History', Museum of\u000a      Cycladic Art (December 2012-May 2013).\u000a    Books\u000a      In Travelling Heroes (first published in 2008), Lane Fox built on\u000a      the successes of his earlier books\u000a      (most recently the popular general history The Classical World) to\u000a      present in a way accessible to\u000a      the general public a scholarly analysis of the results of recent\u000a      archaeological investigations.\u000a      Evidence of the impact of his research lies in the success of both the\u000a      book and the TV programme.\u000a      The UK [text removed for publication] edition received reviews in major\u000a      serious newspapers and\u000a      magazines:[iv] Paul Cartledge in The Independent\u000a      called Lane Fox `one of our most original, daring\u000a      and arguably life-enhancing' historians of ancient Greece,[v]\u000a      and Tom Holland in the Spectator\u000a      wrote that it 'reads as grippingly as any thriller'.[vi]\u000a      The US edition, published by Knopf in 2010\u000a      (paperback 2011), was also widely reviewed [text removed for publication].\u000a      The book has also\u000a      been translated into three European languages. [text removed for\u000a      publication]. It again received\u000a      major reviews;[ix] the German newspaper S&#252;ddeutsche\u000a        Zeitung listed the book as 4th choice for\u000a      non-fiction.[x]\u000a    Lectures\u000a      Lane Fox has given a number of public lectures on the research treated in\u000a      the book, e.g. an Irish\u000a      Academy Lecture, Dublin, November 2009 (150 capacity) and a British Museum\u000a      Public Lecture\u000a      combined with the Annual Lecture for the British School at Ankara,\u000a      December 2009 (250\u000a      audience).\u000a    Television\u000a      The reach of the cultural and educational impact of Lane Fox's research\u000a      was increased by a 90-\u000a      minute TV programme Greek Myths: Tales of Travelling Heroes.[3]\u000a      Lane Fox was approached by\u000a      the BBC to make and present this programme as a result of his standing as\u000a      a widely-read ancient\u000a      historian and, in particular, of the success of the book: Richard Klein,\u000a      Director of BBC4, read the\u000a      book in hardback in early 2009 and sent a Producer, Susan Jones, to\u000a      discuss with Lane Fox\u000a      whether it could be filmed as a coherent documentary. The book was then\u000a      used for the filming in\u000a      autumn 2009 without a separately commissioned script: Lane Fox is credited\u000a      as both writer and\u000a      presenter. The programme included a discussion between Lane Fox and Lemos\u000a      filmed at Lefkandi.\u000a      The first showing in November 2010 on BBC4 had an audience of 436,000,\u000a      well above average for\u000a      a 9 pm documentary on that channel; the fact that the audience increased\u000a      rather than declining\u000a      during the course of the programme is further evidence that it was seen as\u000a      a positive benefit by\u000a      those watching it. Together with five repeats in the following two weeks,\u000a      it had an audience of 1.3\u000a      million with an audience appreciation of 81\/100, again well above average.\u000a      The programme has\u000a      been repeated in the UK since then (e.g. BBC4, 24 May 2012) and sold to\u000a      many international\u000a      broadcasting companies (see below). The success led to Lane Fox' being\u000a      commissioned by the\u000a      BBC to write a 1400-word introduction to the Online Archive of BBC\u000a      Archaeology Programmes for\u000a      their Website (April 2013). Lane Fox also received numerous messages from\u000a      viewers in many\u000a      countries attesting to how their understanding had been transformed: for\u000a      instance, Yuliya\u000a      Yurchenko, a student at Lviv National University, Ukraine, wrote in an\u000a      email on 20 November 2010\u000a      that `I just would like to say \"Thank you\" for your work and incredible\u000a      video about Greek myths. ... A\u000a      lot of things became clearer for me in history, literature and religion.\u000a      That's a great support in my\u000a      studies.'[2]\u000a    Increasing economic prosperity\u000a      The economic beneficiaries of the Oxford research on Euboea include: the\u000a      people of Lefkandi; the\u000a      publishing industry; the television industry. The people of Lefkandi have\u000a      benefited from visitors to\u000a      the site and from students spending a study season at Lefkandi. The\u000a      publishing industry, both in\u000a      the UK and in those countries where it has been translated, has benefited\u000a      from the profits\u000a      generated by Travelling Heroes; employment provided to translators\u000a      is another economic benefit.\u000a      The BBC has benefited from the profit generated through the sale of the TV\u000a      programme Greek\u000a        Myths. The countries that have bought Greek Myths are as\u000a      follows: Austria; Cyprus; United Arab\u000a      Emirates; Italy; Japan; Kazakhstan; Poland; Russian; South Africa; Serbia;\u000a      South Korea; Sweden;\u000a      Taiwan; Ukraine; as well as the Scandinavian broadcasting service[4].\u000a      Lane Fox and Lemos also\u000a      both spoke about their research on Lefkandi in the worldwide version of\u000a      the BBC2 series Ancient\u000a        Worlds, episode 2: The Age of Iron, in a scene specifically\u000a      added to the original UK version to\u000a      boost foreign sales of the series. The economic benefit is also shown by\u000a      the fact that, owing to the\u000a      success of Greek Myths, the BBC has commissioned from Lane Fox a\u000a      new series on the legends\u000a      about the dispersal of the Trojans; it is planned to film this in time for\u000a      screening in late 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Irene Lemos and Robin Lane Fox on Euboean culture and its\u000a      dissemination across\u000a      the Mediterranean has provided cultural, pedagogical, and economic\u000a      benefits to a range of users.\u000a      Archaeological investigation by Lemos has contributed to a radical\u000a      reconfiguring of views of the\u000a      Iron Age of Greece and of links between Greece and the Near East.

Lemos undertook important\u000a      archaeological work\u000a      on cemeteries at the site of Lefkandi on the island of Euboea in 1993-4,\u000a      and, in 2003, she re-\u000a      launched excavations on Xeropolis, a peninsula to the east of the site.\u000a      Lefkandi lies between two\u000a      well-known ancient cities, Chalcis and Eretria, and was first excavated in\u000a      1964, with spectacular\u000a      results. One of the aims of restarting excavation was to compare the\u000a      funerary evidence from the\u000a      Early Iron Age cemeteries at Lefkandi with domestic data from the\u000a      settlement. Another important\u000a      reason to go back to Xeropolis was to deploy systematically a series of\u000a      interdisciplinary methods\u000a      which were lacking from the earlier excavations. Lemos' recent excavations\u000a      have added important\u000a      information for the history of the site from the end of the palatial era\u000a      to its abandonment - from\u000a      1200 to 700 BC. Among them is the discovery in the middle of the ancient\u000a      tell of a city-wall and a\u000a      ritual area located nearby. Continuity from the Late Bronze to the Early\u000a      Iron Age has been also\u000a      observed in the eastern part of Xeropolis where a large building was\u000a      discovered. The rich results of\u000a      Lemos' research into the building and the cemeteries have provided further\u000a      evidence for contacts\u000a      with the East and Egypt much earlier than previously thought, advertising\u000a      the wide range of\u000a      contacts that Euboea enjoyed. Lemos' research bolsters the argument of\u000a      other Oxford\u000a      researchers: the archaeological research of Sir John Boardman on the site\u000a      of Al Mina in Syria, in\u000a      particular his 2002 and 2005 articles based on the analysis of previously\u000a      unpublished material, and\u000a      the text-based analyses on intercultural links in M.L. West's major 1997\u000a      monograph The East Face\u000a        of Helicon, have been fundamental in tracing on contacts between the\u000a      Greek world and the Near\u000a      East. The research of Lemos, Boardman, and West in turn supplied some of\u000a      the archaeological\u000a      and textual framework for Lane Fox's innovative attempt to place the\u000a      Euboeans at the heart of\u000a      eighth-century inter-cultural interactions in both the eastern and the\u000a      western Mediterranean.\u000a    Lane Fox's research drew on a rich body of archaeological and textual\u000a      evidence to analyse how\u000a      particular Greeks from Euboea travelled east and west around the\u000a      Mediterranean in the eighth\u000a      century BC, and how their extraordinary journeys shaped their ideas of\u000a      their gods and heroes. He\u000a      gathered together stories and echoes from many other ancient cultures,\u000a      including Assyrian,\u000a      Egyptian, and Phoenician, and ranges from Mesopotamia to the Rio Tinto at\u000a      Huelva in modern\u000a      Portugal. He argued (in opposition to M. L. West) against the view of\u000a      Homer and his near-\u000a      contemporary Hesiod as poets who owed a direct debt to texts and poems\u000a      from the near East;\u000a      rather, by following the trail of the Greek travellers from Euboea, he\u000a      argued that the poets were in\u000a      debt to their own countrymen. More generally, he analysed how these early\u000a      travellers understood\u000a      the world before the beginnings of philosophy and western thought. The\u000a      most important and\u000a      original contribution of Lane Fox's research lies in his analysis of the\u000a      links between myth,\u000a      landscape, and travel, arguing for the importance of precise landscapes in\u000a      the proximity of Al Mina\u000a      in shaping myths, and for the appearance of the same myths elsewhere in\u000a      the Mediterranean only\u000a      at points of Euboean settlement. Research by Boardman and Lemos provided\u000a      important support\u000a      for this crucial aspect of Lane Fox's argument.\u000a    The key researchers are:\u000a      Mr Robin Lane Fox, Fellow and Tutor in Ancient History, New College,\u000a      1977-.\u000a      Professor Irene Lemos, Junior Research Fellow, St Peter's College, 1993-4;\u000a      Reader in Classical\u000a      Archaeology, 2004-8; Professor of Classical Archaeology, 2008-\u000a      Professor Sir John Boardman, Lincoln Professor of Classical Art and\u000a      Archaeology 1978-1994;\u000a      Emeritus 1994-.\u000a      Dr M.L.

It has focused on the specific\u000d      case study of Arediou, in central Cyprus, as an example of a small\u000d      community that is disengaged from the process by which its cultural\u000d      heritage is constructed and presented, and has only a limited voice, if\u000d      any, in articulating local\/personal experiences of the past. The aim has\u000d      been to explore ways in which this, and similar such communities, might be\u000d      persuaded to engage with constructing their own local narrative,\u000d      integrating their rich archaeological heritage within more recent\u000d      historical experiences. Our aim has and continues to be to ensure the\u000d      preservation of the archaeological and historical heritage of the\u000d      community at Arediou, by actively including members of the community in\u000d      the creation of historical narratives, to encourage them and give them the\u000d      confidence to grasp intellectual ownership of their past and empower them\u000d      to engage with their history. In this the primary objective has been to\u000d      change the local mind-set from one of viewing archaeological sites at best\u000d      as simply curiosities or at worst, as resources to be looted. Instead we\u000d      have helped to develop and encourage an understanding of the local\u000d      archaeology as an important source of knowledge and information regarding\u000d      their heritage, one which they would be proud to claim and which they\u000d      themselves would seek to protect and curate: effectively transforming, if\u000d      you will, 'poachers into gamekeepers'. The primary beneficiary is the\u000d      local community, which has been closely involved in project from its\u000d      inception and has intensified since 2008.\u000d    a) School involvement (2012-2013): As a result of UWTSD funding\u000d      and the subsequent AHRC grant, we have conducted three separate hands-on\u000d      archaeology sessions at the local schools, two with around twenty-thirty\u000d      children and the third with around sixty children (ages 6-11). The\u000d      children had the opportunity to handle various artefacts uncovered at\u000d      their site. A key aim here was for them not only to reconsider how these\u000d      were used and what they might tell us about the ancient community, but\u000d      equally to emphasise the importance of smaller, fragmentary, more\u000d      ephemeral remains that otherwise might be overlooked, and how these also\u000d      contribute to our understanding of the past. We supplied the teachers with\u000d      photographs of the excavation which they have used in follow up\u000d      archaeology classes, in which the children wrote about and\/or drew the\u000d      finds they had handled and the archaeologists they had met. In 2012 the\u000d      school children, through the intermediary of the local mayor (&#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#951;&#940;&#960;&#963;&#949;&#961;),\u000d      presented the archaeologists with a reconstruction of an ancient boat that\u000d      they had made in one of their archaeology classes. The teachers have also\u000d      organised a visit to the archaeological site. In 2013 we presented the\u000d      school with an artist's impression of the site created by Eloise Govier\u000d      (PhD candidate, UWTSD) during in the 2012 study season. During the 2013\u000d      season, the project continued its work with the local school to bring the\u000d      heritage into the children's educational and cultural horizons; currently\u000d      we are preparing an illustrated booklet in Greek telling the story of the\u000d      Bronze Age site. This is designed to excite an interest in the past which\u000d      via the children will permeate the wider community. The link between the\u000d      archaeology found at Arediou since 2004 and its placement within a wider\u000d      Cypriot context engages the local population in an understanding of the\u000d      importance of the village since antiquity. We are working closely with the\u000d      School's headmistress to ensure that this is pitched at an appropriate\u000d      level and is suitable for curricular or ex-curricular activities.\u000d    b) Community engagement. As a result of our engagement with the\u000d      local school and the wider community on a more informal basis we have seen\u000d      a real interest in the community archaeology on the part of the children\u000d      and also their parents. The children demonstrated a good knowledge and\u000d      understanding of their heritage and in particular the importance of Cyprus\u000d      during the Late Bronze Age during the most recent hands-on session:\u000d      knowing the age of the site, the significance of copper production and the\u000d      agricultural role &#8212; which they were able to relate to more recent\u000d      experiences in the village. Regular contact within the wider community (in\u000d      local kafeneia and small businesses) clearly shows that this has impacted\u000d      the wider community's understanding of their ancient heritage and the\u000d      importance of the archaeology. Initial responses to the archaeology ranged\u000d      in 2004 from surprise that we were excavating there &#8212; \"&#941;&#963;&#949;&#953; &#945;&#960;&#963;&#945;&#943;&#945; &#950;&#951;&#959;\u000d        &#913;&#960;&#949;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#973;;\" (is there any archaeology in Arediou?) &#8212; to bemusement at\u000d      the collection of sherds, considered at best rubbish &#8212; \"&#951;&#953; &#949;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#945;&#962;&#951;&#972;;\u000d        &#916;&#949;&#957; &#949;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#953; &#951;&#943;&#960;&#959;&#951;&#945;!\" (What is that? It isn't anything!), to \"&#8220;&#960;&#972;&#950;&#959;\u000d        &#945;&#958;&#943;&#948;&#949;&#953;;\" (how much is that worth?). Frequently we have been made\u000d      privy to the \"economic\" worth of antiquities within and beyond Arediou &#8212;\u000d      from private collections to the common knowledge that \"&#972;&#951;&#945;&#957; &#946;&#960;&#942;&#954;&#945;&#956;&#949;\u000d        &#951;&#940;&#952;&#959;&#953; &#946;&#947;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#949; &#950;&#962;&#954;&#953;&#940; &#956;&#941;&#950;&#945;!\" (When we found tombs we planted fig trees\u000d      in them [to hide them]!). Now, the response from the wider community\u000d      reflects a clear change in attitude and an appreciation of the cultural\u000d      value of their archaeological heritage. We are now regularly told by\u000d      various members of the community how important our work in the area has\u000d      been, that the younger members of the community are beginning to\u000d      appreciate their past (both recent and ancient) and that it is important\u000d      that we are preserving and recording their archaeology. Most\u000d      significantly, there is a clear aspiration on the part of the wider\u000d      community to have a local museum showcasing some of the finds from the\u000d      excavation (for which we are continuing to facilitate dialogue between the\u000d      Local Council and the Department of Antiquities, Nicosia) &#8212; discussed\u000d      below.\u000d    c) Exhibition and local heritage `investment'. At the end of each\u000d      season of fieldwork (between 2004 and 2008) the excavation team prepared a\u000d      display of the key finds of the season for the local community, labelled\u000d      in Greek. The exhibitions were held in conjunction with the village\u000d      council who hosted a barbecue for the community. The aspiration of the\u000d      local community, for which we have secured AHRC funding to help develop,\u000d      is to establish a permanent exhibition space at Arediou, in the\u000d      newly-built Civic Centre. While UWTSD will provide academic expertise, in\u000d      particular the eventual choice of artefacts that will provide a\u000d      representative narrative of the archaeology, we will also be making\u000d      available an interpretative framework for the archaeology. During 2013,\u000d      the PI consulted with the local community and representatives from the\u000d      Department of Antiquities and these discussions have set in place the\u000d      necessary groundwork for the establishment of an exhibition space at\u000d      Arediou. An important aspect of the PI's role was to liaise and facilitate\u000d      communication at an appropriate level between the Local Council and the\u000d      Department of Antiquities, as the route of communication is not always\u000d      clear and the local community feels disempowered in their ability to\u000d      achieve control over their local heritage. Meanwhile the Department of\u000d      Antiquities has a very strict policy concerning the preservation and\u000d      curation of archaeological materials. Discussions with local stakeholders\u000d      have clarified the process with which they need to engage, and have made\u000d      accessible a line of communication with the Department of Antiquities (via\u000d      Dr Eftychia Zachariou) thereby empowering the local community. Such\u000d      engagement with the local officials, custodians and community leaders\u000d      dates back to 2004 and has continued since 2008; this resulted in the\u000d      production of a report on the heritage and ongoing project. Written in\u000d      Greek, the report (&#917;&#954;&#952;&#949;&#950;&#951; &#951;&#959;&#965; &#913;&#961;&#949;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#965;) was circulated amongst the local\u000d      community, via the mayor, town council and local priest. (A copy is\u000d      available on request. Translated by Maria Vasileiou: mvasileiou@gmail.com).\u000d    d) Photographic record. The 2013 season (June) saw the development\u000d      of two new community strands to the project, both of which have been very\u000d      well received. The first is creating a photographic and video record of\u000d      the old village, focusing on two or three buildings which survive to a\u000d      reasonable degree and where we know the families and are able to record\u000d      memories of occupation up to the 1950s-1960s. We have also begun a pilot\u000d      project, recording the more recent histories of the villagers, likewise to\u000d      encourage a more reflexive engagement with the past. In addition, the\u000d      visual record of the old mud brick village, which currently is falling\u000d      into ruin, will be made accessible on the project webpage and we hope this\u000d      will generate further interest in the valuable historical resources on the\u000d      community's doorstep. This has resulted in a real generation of interest\u000d      in the more recent past; most notably, in June the local priest and his\u000d      family organised a tour around the old village with older residents, in\u000d      which they shared stories and information about the \"old way of life\".\u000d    e) Oral history project. In addition to the visual recording of\u000d      the old village, during 2013 we tested the feasibility of an oral history\u000d      project, recording the memories and recollections of the older surviving\u000d      villagers. While we envisage that the experience of sharing and discussing\u000d      memories and histories will also have a positive impact on the community,\u000d      enhancing their sense of pride in their village and their past there are\u000d      broader political questions emerging here also as there is a very strong\u000d      sense within the community of a Greek identity. Furthermore, over several\u000d      years working with the community we have gained the elders' trust and have\u000d      consequently been made privy to many hidden histories by different members\u000d      of the community, including stories which stretch back to the final years\u000d      of Ottoman rule on Cyprus. This potentially important historical\u000d      information is largely unspoken within the community and is in danger of\u000d      being forgotten and lost forever as the older generation dies out. These\u000d      areas of impact relate to the wider goal of contributing to community\u000d      understanding of the immense value of their local heritage, and their\u000d      purposeful engagement with this, as something to protect, preserve and\u000d      pass on to future generations.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    The Arediou Vouppes project has been examining a Late Bronze Age\u000d      settlement in the Cypriot rural hinterland, specifically focusing on the\u000d      archaeological characterisation of a little-known type of agricultural\u000d      site.

Several studies have postulated a complex settlement\u000d    hierarchy: sites being classified by size, location, and material remains.\u000d    At the apex were coastal towns, possible administrative centres involved in\u000d    maritime trade. The island's rural hinterland, however, has received\u000d    considerably less attention. Accordingly, this project has sought to redress\u000d    that imbalance, through detailed exploration of Arediou Vouppes a\u000d    Bronze Age agricultural support village in central Cyprus. Our published\u000d    research has tested various hypotheses advanced to interpret the\u000d    socio-political organisation of LBA Cyprus and we are currently developing a\u000d    more holistic interpretation of a previously little known settlement type.\u000d    The research has been directed by Dr Louise Steel from the University of\u000d    Wales, Trinity Saint David (UWTSD) through a survey in 2004, excavation in\u000d    2005, 2006, 2008 and post excavation analysis in 2007, 2011, 2012.

Analyses have focused on the architectural\u000d        technologies and interpretation of the use and social signification of\u000d        space (Dr Louise Steel, UWTSD). Some aspects have been tested using\u000d        micromorphology (Dr Richard McPhail, UCL)\u000d      Material Culture: analyses of the pottery (Dr Louise Steel, UWTSD)\u000d        suggest significant divergence from the repertoire attested in\u000d        contemporary urban settlements, possibly indicating specialised\u000d        activities. The materiality of the LBA settlement is further being\u000d        explored through detailed analyses of the use and re-use of a range of\u000d        specialised ceramic, metal and stone objects including figurine\u000d        fragments, gaming stones, jewellery items (Dr Louise Steel, UWTSD).

As of 31 July 2013, version 3.1.6 of Diogenes\u000a      (released on 22 October 2007) has been downloaded from the official site\u000a      91,011 times. This is certainly a considerable under-estimate of actual\u000a      use, because Diogenes is a redistributable open-source software.\u000a      Users are encouraged to pass it on to others freely in accordance with the\u000a      license (it is also included with several Linux distributions), so many\u000a      users of Diogenes will not have obtained it from the official\u000a      download site. The download statistics do, however, reflect one particular\u000a      aspect of the impact population: its international character. The UK is\u000a      merely in 7th place in the number of downloads, well behind USA, Spain,\u000a      Italy, Mexico, Brazil and Greece, in that order. The user population of Diogenes\u000a      is mixed. It includes many scholars; when the American Philological\u000a      Association, the professional body of North American classicists, withdrew\u000a      support for its obsolete Pandora programme, it officially endorsed\u000a      Diogenes as the replacement in its Newsletter (August 2005). As one\u000a      Royal Holloway classicist said on a public e- mail list in 2008, `Diogenes\u000a      has emerged as far and away the best tool for the job while commercial and\u000a      funded rivals have fallen away.' Diogenes is also used on a\u000a      considerable scale by students at all levels, and by members of the\u000a      non-academic public who read ancient Greek and Latin for their own\u000a      interest and pleasure. It is not possible to quantify the relative size of\u000a      these segments of the mixed user population, but it is clear that the\u000a      order of magnitude of downloads, not to mention free distributions, dwarfs\u000a      the population of professional classical researchers worldwide.\u000a    The significance of Diogenes is threefold:\u000a    (a) Free access to classical texts. For students and members of\u000a      the public without access to a university library or without an\u000a      institutional subscription to expensive on-line resources, Diogenes\u000a      provides free access to the massive extant corpus of ancient Greek and\u000a      Latin literature which was encoded on now-archaic databases that continue\u000a      to circulate widely via person-to-person copying and peer-to-peer network\u000a      file sharing. Unsolicited e-mails indicate that Diogenes is used\u000a      by a variety of users who may have no other access to Greek and Latin\u000a      texts: `Diogenes I use outside of any formal educational\u000a      setting--it's just for my own use. It is extremely useful for reading\u000a      Latin texts: to determine quickly word meanings, parse forms, or check\u000a      syllable length. I'm taking up Greek (again), and it will surely be just\u000a      as useful for that, too' (9\/9\/2012). `[Diogenes] has been very\u000a      helpful with some words that are hard to find in the Greek lexicons and\u000a      dictionaries that are available to someone who is not a scholar or a\u000a      theological student. I've been teaching myself ancient Greek as I\u000a      translate the New Testament' (20\/4\/2012). `I have been extensively using Diogenes\u000a      for 6 years, all through my undergraduate career at the University of\u000a      Chicago, into ... grad school ..., and now for private study outside of\u000a      any curriculum. I firmly believe it is the best tool ... for studying\u000a      Greek ... I cannot understate the value of such a resource' (11\/3\/2013).\u000a    Diogenes is widely used in countries where libraries may be poorly\u000a      stocked, and where classical editions and lexica are prohibitively\u000a      expensive. It is notable that the top ten countries for downloads include\u000a      Mexico (4th place), Brazil (5th), Columbia (9th), and Argentina (10th),\u000a      ahead of European countries with more developed traditions of studying the\u000a      classics, such as France (11th). Many users from developing countries have\u000a      expressed their gratitude: `Diogenes ... makes my Greek readings a\u000a      lot easier ... I study and teach classical Greek here in Porto Alegre,\u000a      Brazil' (24\/10\/2009). From Poland: `Diogenes has been my one and\u000a      only tool for working on classical texts ever since I first installed it\u000a      ... I find it truly amazing' (11\/03\/2009).\u000a    (b) Morphology and lexica for language learners. The morphological\u000a      analysis and lexical look- up tools in Diogenes support active,\u000a      self-directed, and independent engagement with the ancient languages on\u000a      the part of secondary school students, undergraduates, postgraduates and\u000a      non- academic users. Clicking on a word in Diogenes instantly\u000a      generates a morphological analysis from Perseus, and corresponding\u000a      definitions from the standard Greek and Latin lexica of Liddell-Scott-\u000a      Jones and Lewis-Short. This makes it much easier to look up a word in\u000a      these advanced tools than in even the smallest beginner's dictionary. Diogenes\u000a      therefore helps students to appreciate that translating words from Latin\u000a      and Greek is not a simple matter of one-to-one mapping, but of negotiating\u000a      complex, non-congruent semantic boundaries. Many language teachers use Diogenes\u000a      for the very easy and intuitive way in which it integrates advanced\u000a      lexicographical tools. A language teaching officer in Classics at\u000a      Cambridge University writes: `At my induction meetings I recommend that\u000a      all my students &#8212; whether undergraduate or graduate &#8212; download and use the\u000a      programme as a matter of course; they routinely report: \"it changed my\u000a      life!\" &#8212; as it has mine. I imagine that a large proportion of our student\u000a      body here uses Diogenes regularly' (5\/10\/2012). A professor in the USA\u000a      writes: `Diogenes is ... open all the time&#8212;it's a wonderful teaching tool\u000a      and I have all my students use it' (16\/10\/2011). Not only beginners, but\u000a      students at all levels around the world use Diogenes: `I'm a\u000a      student from Catania University ... and I would thank you for developing\u000a      this fantastic open source program' (24\/4\/2009). `[Diogenes is] a\u000a      great help for my studies in Classics at Munich university (LMU)!'\u000a      (25\/10\/2011). `I'm a young Portuguese classicist, and just wish to say\u000a      thank you for your kind contribution to knowledge. You developed a\u000a      wonderful tool that really helps those [who] seek to better understand the\u000a      ancient world and its literature.' (28\/05\/2009). Self-directed learners of\u000a      Latin and Greek rely on Diogenes for morphological tools and\u000a      lexica. Hundreds of postings to TextKit, a public internet forum\u000a      frequented by independent learners of Greek and Latin, recommend it to\u000a      newcomers. Some of these users even adapt it for their own purposes, for\u000a      example, setting up the browser Firefox so that a click will command Diogenes\u000a      to parse and define a Greek or Latin word found on any website on the\u000a      internet. Another user, who describes himself as `a professional computer\u000a      geek who has been interested in classical languages his entire life' has\u000a      incorporated Diogenes into the website he created with a selection\u000a      of resources for `self-teaching amateur classicists'. Students and\u000a      teachers of Latin and Greek at all levels rely on Diogenes.\u000a    (c) Influencing open access in digital classics. Diogenes\u000a      was the first large open-source project in Classics, and other projects\u000a      have followed its example; this sharing of resources has benefitted the\u000a      common good. It brought to light the undocumented structure of the CD-ROM\u000a      databases published by the Packard Humanities Institute (PHI) and the Thesaurus\u000a        Linguae Graecae (TLG). Diogenes pioneered the advanced\u000a      functionality which is now also available via the on-line TLG,\u000a      such as integrated morphological analysis with lexicon look-up and\u000a      morphologically aware searching. This means that even those who access\u000a      classical texts through other digital interfaces have benefitted from the\u000a      example set by Diogenes.\u000a    Of greater lasting significance, however, is the current movement to\u000a      create and release new digital resources under open access licenses which\u000a      will ensure that they remain perpetually free. The Perseus project\u000a      at Tufts University followed Diogenes' example when it made its\u000a      texts and tools available under an open access license. This in turn\u000a      permitted Diogenes to integrate Perseus' morphological\u000a      analysis data and digitized lexica. PhiloLogic, at the University\u000a      of Chicago, has combined texts from Perseus and re-used some\u000a      source code from Diogenes. More recently, Harvard's Center for\u000a      Hellenic Studies (CHS) has launched several open access initiatives, in\u000a      which they have acknowledged Diogenes as the trailblazing model.\u000a      The director of CHS writes: `Diogenes has embraced the concept of\u000a      open access for a tool that is exceptionally important and effective for\u000a      students at all levels of competence in Ancient Greek, and it has done so\u000a      in a way that has and will continue to inspire others to do the same.' On\u000a      a more practical note, one of the collaborators on digital projects at the\u000a      CHS writes: `without your open-source tools, I can honestly say that\u000a      important parts of the Homer Multitext project would probably be a\u000a      decade behind where we are now.' Diogenes has thus provided both a\u000a      model for other projects of the principles of open access for digital\u000a      classics, and freely available tools which those projects have been able\u000a      to use and build upon. In June 2013 Heslin built an extension to Diogenes\u000a      to bring the CD-ROM databases into the modern era by converting them to an\u000a      easily understandable XML-based format. The DigiLibLT project in Vercelli,\u000a      Italy, intends to distribute the PHI database of Latin texts, after being\u000a      converted to XML by Diogenes, from their website under an open\u000a      access, Creative- Commons license. For the ways in which Diogenes\u000a      has been influencing other open access digital projects at Durham, see REF\u000a      3a.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Diogenes, created solely by Peter Heslin, is a freely\u000a      distributed, open-source programme which enables access to all the major\u000a      databases of classical Greek and Latin texts that have been in public\u000a      circulation since the mid 1980s. Diogenes has had a significant\u000a      and lasting impact on the education and cultural life of many of its tens\u000a      of thousands of users. Some of these are professional classicists, who\u000a      utilize it for both research and teaching. But a much larger part of the\u000a      user population consists of students and non-academic readers of ancient\u000a      Greek and Latin.

Heslin first became aware of the\u000a      shortcomings of available digital resources while conducting research for\u000a      his first monograph, The Transvestite Achilles. His research on\u000a      Latin epic prompted the creation of Diogenes, and the book and the\u000a      programme evolved in tandem. For example, a query using the archaic, and\u000a      now obsolete, Pandora programme to find all places in Greek and\u000a      Latin literature in which the island of Scyros is mentioned (a question\u000a      fundamental to The Transvestite Achilles) produced results which\u000a      were incorrect and incomplete. Further research showed that the error was\u000a      due to improper omission of passages where the searched word was\u000a      hyphenated in the printed editions on which Pandora depends. To\u000a      give another example, Heslin needed to identify parallels for\u000a      particular noun-adjective combinations, but found that this could not be\u000a      done reliably by Pandora.\u000a    b) Diogenes as research. Diogenes itself is a work of\u000a      original research, and was submitted as such in RAE 2001. The databases of\u000a      classical Greek and Latin texts, which were first developed in the 1970s\u000a      on mainframe computers, use an idiosyncratic, ad-hoc encoding which\u000a      involves extensive manipulation of individual ones and zeroes, rather\u000a      than, say, self-documenting tags, as in XML. In the absence of any\u000a      documentation, the only way to establish the significance of the stream of\u000a      apparently meaningless numbers by which the databases encode the metadata\u000a      of the classical texts (e.g. book and line numbers, lemmata, complex page\u000a      layout of scholia) was by a process of reverse-engineering. This entailed\u000a      reading the opaque computer code of the databases in order to identify the\u000a      features of the classical text which were embedded there. This could only\u000a      be done by a researcher equally versed in binary data encoding and in the\u000a      conventions of the most challenging of printed classical texts, from\u000a      documentary papyri to scholia. Furthermore, integrating the Perseus\u000a      morphological and lexical tool into Diogenes required the skills\u000a      of a software developer who was intimately familiar with the quirks of\u000a      Greek and Latin morphology and lexicography. This research is expressed\u000a      and embodied in the computer code and internal documentation of Diogenes,\u000a      which is downloaded by every user of the programme.\u000a    Initial work on reverse-engineering the Latin and Greek databases began\u000a      in 1999 and continued apace after Heslin was appointed at Durham\u000a      in 2000 as a Lecturer in Classics. This initial phase of development, in\u000a      which new features were gradually added as further aspects of the\u000a      databases were decoded, continued until version 1.0 was released in 2003.\u000a      The next phase of research and development focused on finding an\u000a      infrastructure that would enable easy installation by non- technical users\u000a      on three different platforms: Windows, Mac and Linux. This arrived with\u000a      the 3.0 release of Diogenes in 2007. The most recent phase\u000a      involved the large task of integrating open- source morphological and\u000a      lexical tools from Perseus; this was done later in 2007 and led to\u000a      version 3.1.\u000a    c) Dissemination of research insights. As Heslin was\u000a      developing Diogenes, he articulated and disseminated the research\u000a      insights of his work in a series of publications. Reverse-engineering the\u000a      specifics of version E of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG)\u000a      CD-ROM led to a substantial review article on that database. An equally\u000a      substantial review article on an early version of the Thesaurus\u000a        Linguae Latinae (TLL) CD-ROM was motivated by the urgency of\u000a      preventing that project from making some of the same mistakes as those of\u000a      other classical databases. A podcast (Diogenes: Milestones and Morals:\u000a      http:\/\/www.digitalclassicist.org\/wip\/wip2008-12ph.html)\u000a      outlines the history of the interaction between classical research and\u000a      computer science, and maps out the future directions which research at\u000a      Durham is pursuing to create more sophisticated and freely-distributable\u000a      corpora of ancient texts.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17511","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A. Broader and better informed public appreciation of Homeric poetry\u000d\u000a      Durham research on Homer informed the intellectual itinerary of a major\u000d\u000a      touring exhibition entitled\u000d\u000a      Homer: Der Mythos von Troia in Dichtung und Kunst (Antikenmuseum\u000d\u000a      Basel und Sammlung\u000d\u000a      Ludwig, from 16 March to 17 August 2008, and Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen,\u000d\u000a      Mannheim, from 13\u000d\u000a      September 2008 to 18 January 2009). The exhibition treated the ancient\u000d\u000a      portraits of Homer as an\u000d\u000a      aspect of the reception of epic, placing them after artefacts illustrating\u000d\u000a      the contents of the Iliad and\u000d\u000a      the Odyssey. The exhibition catalogue, pp. 20-34, acknowledged the\u000d\u000a      work of Graziosi and\u000d\u000a      Haubold as informing the thematic focus of the exhibition. About\u000d\u000a      110,000 visitors in Mannheim and\u000d\u000a      41,000 in Basel were presented with portraits of Homer, after artefacts\u000d\u000a      illustrating the content of\u000d\u000a      the poems, and were thus invited to view them as early responses to epic\u000d\u000a      poetry (underpinning\u000d\u000a      research: 2.1 above).\u000d\u000a    Mainstream publishers consider Durham research on Homer relevant to\u000d\u000a      general readers, and\u000d\u000a      capable of enriching their understanding. Graziosi set out Durham\u000d\u000a      research on Homeric\u000d\u000a      authorship, Near-Eastern and Greek oral epic traditions, Homeric society,\u000d\u000a      traditional epic\u000d\u000a      language, and reception history (2.1-5 above) in her Introduction and\u000d\u000a      Notes for a new translation of\u000d\u000a      the Iliad by Tony Verity for Oxford World Classics (OWC 2011).\u000d\u000a      Durham research also `lies behind\u000d\u000a      most pages' of the translation (Verity, p. xxix), which has now sold over\u000d\u000a      6,000 copies. Strong\u000d\u000a      media endorsements include BBC Radio 3 Night Waves on 5 October\u000d\u000a      2011 (initial audience ca.\u000d\u000a      150,000, also available through the BBC website and YouTube) and The\u000d\u000a        Economist 15 October\u000d\u000a      2011 (circulation ca. 1.5 million). A guide to the translation for\u000d\u000a      Podularity: Authors and Books in a\u000d\u000a        Pod, also available on Vimeo, offers free access to several strands\u000d\u000a      of Durham research on Homer\u000d\u000a      and its effect on Verity's translation. Open Letters Monthly (17\u000d\u000a      November 2011) states of the\u000d\u000a      Introduction: `These pages... are the finest thing about Homer yet written\u000d\u000a      in the 21st century for a\u000d\u000a      popular audience.' The success of the OWC Iliad has led to a\u000d\u000a      contract for a companion Odyssey;\u000d\u000a      and for Homer: A Very Short Introduction (OUP). Durham research on\u000d\u000a      Homer reaches an even\u000d\u000a      broader audience with The Gods of Olympus: A History (Profile\u000d\u000a      Books, UK; Metropolitan\/Holt,\u000d\u000a      USA; AmbosAnthos, the Netherlands; Patmos Verlag, Germany; De Agostini,\u000d\u000a      Italy; and\u000d\u000a      Pensamento, Brazil), with projected total sales of ca. 40,000.\u000d\u000a    B. Enhanced learning and teaching of Homeric epic in secondary and\u000d\u000a        tertiary education\u000d\u000a      Publications 1-4 listed in section 3 above regularly feature on\u000d\u000a      undergraduate and MA reading lists\u000d\u000a      nationally and internationally, and have led to changes of syllabus and\u000d\u000a      curriculum developments.\u000d\u000a      Iliad 6 has been adopted as a new set text in several institutions,\u000d\u000a      nationally and internationally (e.g.\u000d\u000a      USA, Germany, Italy, Russia, Brazil, Australia, China), as a result of Graziosi's\u000d\u000a      and Haubold's\u000d\u000a      commentary (published in the influential `Green and Yellow' series); all\u000d\u000a      reviews to date emphasise\u000d\u000a      its usefulness in the classroom. Publications 3 and 4 are also regularly\u000d\u000a      used in secondary\u000d\u000a      education, and 3 is recommended by the Association for Latin Teaching on\u000d\u000a      its blog.\u000d\u000a      School teachers and pupils benefit from Durham research on Homer not only\u000d\u000a      through the\u000d\u000a      publications mentioned above, but also through talks and teaching\u000d\u000a      materials. Every year since\u000d\u000a      2003 Graziosi has been using her Homeric research when lecturing\u000d\u000a      for Sovereign Education,\u000d\u000a      reaching a yearly average of 300\/400 secondary school students. In 2010,\u000d\u000a      she delivered an\u000d\u000a      address to the annual meeting of the Joint Association of Classical\u000d\u000a      Teachers, and in 2012 she\u000d\u000a      lectured and produced a 12-page booklet of teaching materials for Keynote\u000d\u000a      Educational. Sovereign\u000d\u000a      Education commented in an unsolicited e-mail on 2 April 2009 that Graziosi's\u000d\u000a      lecture was\u000d\u000a      `perfectly pitched, inspirational and exactly what they needed'. Keynote\u000d\u000a      Educational reported on\u000d\u000a      teachers' feedback which described her guidance on teaching Homer as\u000d\u000a      `outstanding' (unsolicited\u000d\u000a      e-mail on 20 July 2012). Continuing demand for school talks, teaching\u000d\u000a      materials, and articles for\u000d\u000a      Omnibus confirm that Durham research helps students to learn &#8212; and\u000d\u000a      teachers to enhance their\u000d\u000a      interest and understanding.\u000d\u000a    C. Homer in the local community\u000d\u000a      The Homeric research of Graziosi and Haubold has reached\u000d\u000a      beyond established partnerships\u000d\u000a      with schools, teacher associations, and private education, to engage new\u000d\u000a      audiences in local\u000d\u000a      communities in the North East of England. Graziosi secured Durham\u000d\u000a      University seedcorn funding\u000d\u000a      (&#163;7,500) to support two innovative collaborations: with Changeling\u000d\u000a      Productions, a community arts\u000d\u000a      company working, with recognised effectiveness, in areas of social and\u000d\u000a      economic deprivation; and\u000d\u000a      Creative Communities, a not-for-profit association for cultural\u000d\u000a      regeneration in the North East.\u000d\u000a      Changeling Productions designed and delivered music and theatre workshops\u000d\u000a      based on Durham\u000d\u000a      research on Homer (see section 2.1 above), offering the following\u000d\u000a      intellectual trajectory:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      participants read and discussed selections from the Odyssey;\u000d\u000a      they imagined who might have composed the poem, exploring ancient and\u000d\u000a        modern theories;\u000d\u000a      they contributed to the creation of a local, County Durham Homer which\u000d\u000a        is being used in a\u000d\u000a        professional theatre production conceived for two actors: a rhapsode\u000d\u000a        arriving in Durham,\u000d\u000a        determined to perform Homer's Odyssey, and an interjecting\u000d\u000a        member of the audience, demanding\u000d\u000a        to know who this great Homer was, and offering his own (locally\u000d\u000a        inflected) conjectures.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    All workshops took place in March-July 2013, in or near Spennymoor &#8212; a\u000d\u000a      small former industrial\u000d\u000a      town in County Durham characterised by high unemployment, a large\u000d\u000a      percentage of social\u000d\u000a      housing, and a town centre in need substantial regeneration. Changeling\u000d\u000a      Productions adopted a\u000d\u000a      three-pronged approach, offering sessions not only in local schools, but\u000d\u000a      also addressing members\u000d\u000a      of the public through street performances, and setting up workshops in the\u000d\u000a      local library and in the\u000d\u000a      Spennymoor Vacant Shop, managed by Creative Communities. In this way they\u000d\u000a      reached a broad\u000d\u000a      demographic, often involving different members of the same families and\u000d\u000a      networks, and thus\u000d\u000a      creating `a Homeric vibe around town' (project report). Five schools\u000d\u000a      hosted workshops: Whitworth\u000d\u000a      Academy (Secondary School), The Oaks (Special Needs Secondary School),\u000d\u000a      Kirk Merrington\u000d\u000a      Primary School, King Street Primary School, and Ox Close Primary School.\u000d\u000a      These were supported\u000d\u000a      through street performances and regular Saturday sessions at the Vacant\u000d\u000a      Shop, where `interest\u000d\u000a      increased week-by-week' (project report).\u000d\u000a    Workshops were inspired by &#8212; and in turn demonstrated &#8212; the main tenet of\u000d\u000a      Graziosi's research:\u000d\u000a      that imagining the author is a means of establishing a personal\u000d\u000a      relationship with the text. The\u000d\u000a      project report by Changeling concludes: `When asked to describe a\u000d\u000a      contemporary Homer there\u000d\u000a      was a noticeable consistency, regardless of whether respondents were\u000d\u000a      school children in a\u000d\u000a      classroom, or senior citizens, unemployed youths or soldiers on leave\u000d\u000a      walking down the street &#8212; Homer\u000d\u000a      was imagined as homeless, walking about looking for inspiration, slightly\u000d\u000a      scruffy, intent on\u000d\u000a      telling and selling stories to make a living. Homer was never cast as\u000d\u000a      alien, nor were his epics\u000d\u000a      considered irrelevant to present circumstances. Indeed, one of the most\u000d\u000a      surprising results of the\u000d\u000a      project was the ease and wit with which participants related the Odyssey\u000d\u000a      and its imagined author\u000d\u000a      to local Spennymoor people and places.'\u000d\u000a    The benefits of this collaboration between Durham University, Changeling\u000d\u000a      Productions, and\u000d\u000a      Creative Communities are twofold. 1. Educational: participants learn about\u000d\u000a      Homeric epic and how\u000d\u000a      Homeric authorship is approached at Durham University. 2. Social and\u000d\u000a      cultural: arts projects\u000d\u000a      involving people who do not usually have occasion to meet and work\u000d\u000a      together (in this case:\u000d\u000a      university researchers, artists, musicians, teachers, school children,\u000d\u000a      charity workers, librarians and\u000d\u000a      members of the general public in Spennymoor) have demonstrable benefits in\u000d\u000a      the acquisition of\u000d\u000a      cultural and social capital: see Hampshire and Matthijsse (2010), quoted\u000d\u000a      below in section 5C.\u000d\u000a    D.

As a result of his clinical\u000d\u000a      experience he has also\u000d\u000a      increasingly worked for the prevention of PTSD, opening a policy debate\u000d\u000a      about career progression\u000d\u000a      in the US army, in his capacity as Chair of Ethics, Leadership, and\u000d\u000a      Personnel Policy in the Office of\u000d\u000a      the U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel. His chief contribution\u000d\u000a      to the understanding,\u000d\u000a      treatment and prevention of PTSD is the identification of `moral injury'\u000d\u000a      as a key factor inhibiting the\u000d\u000a      acquisition of successful treatment. Moral injury, in Dr Shay's\u000d\u000a      definition, occurs when somebody in\u000d\u000a      a position of authority violates what is right (as defined within a\u000d\u000a      particular cultural and social\u000d\u000a      setting) in a high-stakes situation. His understanding of moral injury\u000d\u000a      derives from his clinical work in\u000d\u000a      combination with a thorough investigation of Homeric epic which he has &#8212;\u000d\u000a      in the last ten years &#8212; developed\u000d\u000a      in dialogue with Haubold. This dialogue was accompanied by a\u000d\u000a      broadening of focus\u000d\u000a      and a shift of emphasis, on the part of Shay, from treatment of individual\u000d\u000a      patients to general issues\u000d\u000a      of leadership and institutional hierarchies. He first acknowledged the\u000d\u000a      impact of Haubold's research\u000d\u000a      on his own work in Amphora 2.2, 2003, p. 8: `I attribute a\u000d\u000a      fiduciary duty to ... military leaders.\u000d\u000a      Haubold meticulously documents textual evidence that the moral world of\u000d\u000a      the Homeric poems held\u000d\u000a      leaders to obligations of a fiduciary nature.' Since that initial point of\u000d\u000a      contact, Shay and Haubold\u000d\u000a      have exchanged publications, met (at the invitation of Dr Shay) in\u000d\u000a      Washington DC in 2011, and\u000d\u000a      met again in Durham in 2013, to disseminate Shay's approach to the\u000d\u000a      treatment of PTSD to an\u000d\u000a      audience of about 80 NHS health professionals and classicists, through a\u000d\u000a      public lecture promoted\u000d\u000a      by the Durham Centre for the Medical Humanities and the Institute of\u000d\u000a      Advanced Study.\u000d\u000a    Over the last ten years, Shay has regularly used Durham research on\u000d\u000a      Homeric society and\u000d\u000a      language in order to substantiate his emphasis on `moral injury': in his\u000d\u000a      own acknowledgement,\u000d\u000a      Haubold is the Homeric scholar he quotes `most often' both in his\u000d\u000a      clinical and policy work. Failures\u000d\u000a      of leadership, as articulated in the Homeric texts and analysed in the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research 2.3\u000d\u000a      and 2.4 above, are useful to Shay's approach, both therapeutically, as\u000d\u000a      patients compare\u000d\u000a      themselves, cross-culturally, to the Homeric heroes, and at the level of\u000d\u000a      policy, where Shay argues\u000d\u000a      that promotion to leadership positions in the US army should include\u000d\u000a      assessment by peers and\u000d\u000a      those of inferior rank in a 360&#176; approach, rather than depend exclusively\u000d\u000a      on the assessment of\u000d\u000a      one's own superiors, as it currently is. That Shay's claims about Homeric\u000d\u000a      failures of leadership are\u000d\u000a      grounded in rigorous and up-to-date research is important, since trust is\u000d\u000a      a key aspect of his\u000d\u000a      approach to the treatment and prevention of PTSD: fiduciary care, in his\u000d\u000a      view, must include taking\u000d\u000a      care that statements about Homeric epic are correct, and not just\u000d\u000a      expedient. This shows that\u000d\u000a      Durham research on Homer is not used here simply because it can have\u000d\u000a      impact on the treatment\u000d\u000a      and prevention of PTSD, but because it is considered to be of high quality\u000d\u000a      by its own academic\u000d\u000a      standards.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Durham University research on Homeric epic has had four main forms of\u000d\u000a      impact:\u000d\u000a    A.

Their key\u000d\u000a      research insights are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aHomeric authorship. The `Homeric question' has stimulated\u000d\u000a        classical research and the popular\u000d\u000a        imagination for several centuries. Graziosi adds a new dimension\u000d\u000a        by asking not who composed\u000d\u000a        the Iliad and the Odyssey, but how the Greeks imagined\u000d\u000a        Homer. She therefore considers Homeric\u000d\u000a        authorship a matter of reception rather than composition, arguing that\u000d\u000a        the imagined author is where\u000d\u000a        the reader makes personal contact with the text. This insight affects\u000d\u000a        how Homer is presented to\u000d\u000a        general readers, and taught in schools.\u000d\u000a      \u000aHomeric and Near-Eastern epic. Similarities between ancient\u000d\u000a        Greek and Near-Eastern epic were\u000d\u000a        identified as soon as cuneiform texts were deciphered. Early scholarship\u000d\u000a        focused on collecting\u000d\u000a        `parallels' between these two traditions, and postulating models of\u000d\u000a        transmission and influence.\u000d\u000a        Haubold, by contrast, asks how knowledge of Near-Eastern poetry\u000d\u000a        enhances a literary\u000d\u000a        appreciation of Homer and vice versa, arguing that both early\u000d\u000a        Greek and near Eastern epic are\u000d\u000a        fundamentally concerned with mortality, and the place of human beings in\u000d\u000a        a broadly shared\u000d\u000a        conception of the history of the cosmos. This insight presents classics\u000d\u000a        as a means of appreciating\u000d\u000a        contact across cultures, rather than as defining one culture (e.g.\u000d\u000a        European or Western) against\u000d\u000a        others (see also REF3a, section b.9 for a feature article on this\u000d\u000a        research in The Guardian).\u000d\u000a      \u000aHomeric society. Graziosi and Haubold combine\u000d\u000a        their approaches in order to offer a new\u000d\u000a        interpretation of Homeric society. They start from early definitions of\u000d\u000a        the Homeric oeuvre\u000d\u000a        (Graziosi) and from an implied social history shared across that\u000d\u000a        broad oeuvre (cf. Near-Eastern\u000d\u000a        epic, Haubold), and argue that the two Homeric poems imply a\u000d\u000a        history of personal weakening and\u000d\u000a        institutional progress. Homeric leaders generally fail their people, and\u000d\u000a        often display `excessive\u000d\u000a        manliness': their failings can only be remedied through greater social\u000d\u000a        cohesion. This insight\u000d\u000a        influences how military leadership and its failures are approached\u000d\u000a        today, particularly in relation to\u000d\u000a        the prevention of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\u000d\u000a      \u000aOral-traditional poetry. Homeric epic stems from a tradition of\u000d\u000a        oral composition in performance:\u000d\u000a        the oral origins of the poems are often regarded as a limitation to\u000d\u000a        their literary expressiveness.\u000d\u000a        Graziosi and Haubold argue, in detail, that traditional\u000d\u000a        techniques of oral composition are\u000d\u000a        harnessed to specific and expressive effects. Their research enriches\u000d\u000a        the interpretation of specific\u000d\u000a        passages not just for specialists, but also for students and general\u000d\u000a        readers.\u000d\u000a      \u000aReception. Graziosi and Haubold argue that\u000d\u000a        reception of an earlier tradition starts within the\u000d\u000a        poems themselves, where obscure terms are often glossed; and that the\u000d\u000a        history of reception is\u000d\u000a        activated in each new reading of the Homeric poems. For this reason,\u000d\u000a        they embed the study of\u000d\u000a        reception in their commentary work, and see the impact of their research\u000d\u000a        as itself part of an open\u000d\u000a        and continuing dialogue that spans from antiquity to the present.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18014","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research listed above is widely used in teaching art and archaeology\u000a      and museology in HEIs\u000a      other than Cambridge (the references cited above give some evidence of\u000a      that). The particular\u000a      impact explored here is the impact a) on, and b) by means of, the\u000a      re-display of the Greek and\u000a      Roman gallery in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge (re-opened 20 January\u000a      2010). Through this\u000a      re-display the research impacts on cultural life, education and public\u000a      discourse, attracting more\u000a      visitors to the Fitzwilliam and to Cambridge and improving the quality of\u000a      visitor experience (from\u000a      schoolchild to tourist).\u000a    The re-designed galleries are significantly different from all other\u000a      museum displays of Greek and\u000a      Roman antiquities. Beard, Osborne and Vout had an input into all aspects\u000a      of the display, including\u000a      its physical arrangement and philosophy, individual labels, interpretative\u000a      panels, hand-held\u000a      information boards for use in the gallery and parallel web resources,\u000a      exploiting their past research\u000a      to give these a distinctive form and content. The stress throughout is on\u000a      a much richer range of\u000a      object histories than is customary in museums where one story (of history,\u000a      art history or ancient\u000a      life) is normally privileged. The new display draws the visitor's\u000a      attention repeatedly to the functions\u000a      of objects displayed; the importance of findspots; the circumstances and\u000a      date of discovery; the\u000a      information to be gained from technical analysis; and the key role played\u000a      by collectors in\u000a      determining the appearance, nature and meaning of these objects and in\u000a      shaping museum\u000a      collections.\u000a    For example, the display of the Pashley Sarcophagus explains not only its\u000a      Dionysiac iconography\u000a      but also its allusion to the Roman triumph and its collecting and\u000a      restoration history; that of the\u000a      Foundry Painter's Lewis Collection cup draws attention to iconographic\u000a      details to stress the\u000a      questions raised for ancient drinkers; that of the Flaxman Apollo points\u000a      both to John Flaxman's\u000a      late-eighteenth-century restorations and the way Victorian collectors such\u000a      as John Disney (who\u000a      gifted his collection to the Fitzwilliam) responded to such restorations.\u000a    The overriding aim was both to engage visitors with the Fitzwilliam's\u000a      collection, and to help them\u000a      understand how museums arrive at the range of objects on show and the\u000a      claims in their labels,\u000a      why different museum collections vary, and why all of them offer only\u000a      partial views of (the remains\u000a      of) the Greek and Roman world. The new display was to be an object lesson\u000a      in museology, as well\u000a      as antiquity. This aspect was particularly noted in the Museums\u000a        Journal (May 2010, 52-53): `In\u000a      terms of the way the objects are organised and the narratives constructed\u000a      by the displays there is\u000a      a clear engagement with new scholarship... the redisplay attempts to\u000a      construct a biography of each\u000a      object or group by highlighting the role of people in the creation of\u000a      meaning. The redisplay also\u000a      focuses on making the processes of the museum transparent....'\u000a    \"I feel much more enthused about Greece and Rome.\" There is clear\u000a      evidence, both from such\u000a      reactions and from a statistical survey, that this emphasis has made an\u000a      impact on visitors. An\u000a      evaluation exercise in 2010 by the Project's Curatorial Research Associate\u000a      demonstrated the high\u000a      level of use and appreciation of the information in the new Greek and\u000a      Roman gallery. Almost all\u000a      visitors (96%) claimed to have looked at one or more of the types of\u000a      information on offer. Most\u000a      indicated that the amount of information given was just right (87%),\u000a      commenting that the labels\u000a      \"were well done\" and \"cater for both the lay person and the intellectual\",\u000a      providing \"just the right\u000a      amount of detail to inform me but not bore me!\" while they \"did not talk\u000a      down to the reader\" and\u000a      proved \"Interactive &#8212; engaging labels made me think\".\u000a    But had the new display impacted on visitors' understanding? 86% of\u000a      visitors surveyed indicated\u000a      that the gallery had affected their views, 30% reckoning that they had a\u000a      better understanding of the\u000a      ancient world as a result of their gallery visit. 74% demonstrated that\u000a      they had gained an\u000a      understanding of issues such as the function of objects, and\/or could\u000a      remember particular\u000a      information about a range of objects &#8212; and the comments of 19% of visitors\u000a      showed that they had\u000a      assimilated such complex themes as cross-cultural influences or the\u000a      survival, collection history and\u000a      afterlife of the objects.\u000a    Study days and other events in Cambridge and outside (e.g. Dr Burn\u000a      talking at the Metropolitan\u000a      Museum in New York) during 2009-12 acquainted the public more closely with\u000a      the aims of the re-display.\u000a      In September 2011, a major conference, attracting a large number of museum\u000a      professionals from the UK and abroad, explored issues of the public\u000a      display of antiquities.

The\u000a      Fitzwilliam re-display impresses all these aspects upon the visiting\u000a      public.\u000a    Outline of the research:\u000a    a) by examining particular types of image &#8212; images seen and used in\u000a      particular settings, or images\u000a      that elicit particular reactions &#8212; Beard, Osborne and Vout have\u000a      demonstrated the importance of\u000a      understanding ancient imagery in context (3,5,7,8,9,10); the visual\u000a      information in ancient\u000a      iconography has been shown by their research to be part of a communication\u000a      between object and\u000a      viewers at a given point of time and in particular circumstances: for\u000a      example, at the symposium (5)\u000a      or in the nineteenth-century museum (2).\u000a    b) by demonstrating the ways in which objects made in one time and place\u000a      become different\u000a      objects with roles that are often quite distinct when appropriated,\u000a      imitated or adapted in another\u000a      time or place (1,3,6-9) &#8212; including in the Fitzwilliam Museum\u000a      itself (2, Journal of the History of\u000a        Collections 2012) &#8212; Beard, Osborne and Vout have stressed that\u000a      objects are not finished when\u000a      they leave the artist's studio but rather are born there, and that there\u000a      are many stories still to be\u000a      told about them.\u000a    c) by demonstrating the need to see objects from the past as made by, and\u000a      for, individuals (4,7),\u000a      and to take account of their history as a history shaped by individuals (2,8,10)\u000a      Beard, Osborne and\u000a      Vout have put both the series of patrons and owners of objects and the\u000a      series of collectors and\u000a      scholars (whether the Emperor Hadrian or Sir John Beazley) who have\u000a      written about objects back\u000a      into the story of classical archaeology.\u000a    d) by examining the histories of particular collections, including\u000a      collections in Cambridge (2,\u000a      Journal of the History of Collections 2012), Beard and Vout\u000a      have shown the ways in which all\u000a      museum collections are products of their particular histories, shaped by\u000a      the interests of collectors\u000a      who gave their collections, of curators who have pursued particular\u000a      interests, of authors who have\u000a      fostered particular narratives and of the changing legal status for\u000a      objects excavated abroad.\u000a    Particularly distinctive to this research is its application of\u000a      approaches previously pioneered by\u000a      Beard and Osborne to specific objects and situations, some with direct\u000a      reference to the Fitzwilliam\u000a      Museum and other Cambridge material.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18016","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Following the publication of his first book on Jerusalem, Goldhill was\u000a      invited to act as a peer-reviewer and active participant in PUSH [5.1],\u000a      funded by the EU and, in its latter stages, also by the Norwegian\u000a      Government. Goldhill was officially involved in the project between 2006\u000a      and 2010. The UNESCO chief representative for the region stated, `the\u000a      contribution of all the peer reviewers was critical in establishing trust\u000a      between the partners; and especially the initial presentation by Professor\u000a      Goldhill was a major contribution in setting the scene' [5.2]. This\u000a      project brought together Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian public policy\u000a      officials, academics, and participants in ecological and cultural heritage\u000a      industries, for a series of meetings in 2008, 2009 and 2010. For political\u000a      and security reasons, the meetings were initially private and secret, but\u000a      subsequently became public, and led to policy decisions with regard both\u000a      to the management of sites of cultural heritage and to strategies with\u000a      regard to natural resources and their importance to the region. Perhaps\u000a      the most significant result of such long-term activity is the return of a\u000a      flow of fresh water to the river Jordan for the first time in 40 years\u000a      (summer 2013); prior to the control of the sewage and salt water flow that\u000a      currently still pollutes it [5.3]. As well as acting as a remote\u000a      peer-reviewer throughout the programme, Goldhill also attended four\u000a      meetings at both the private and the public stages of the programme as\u000a      peer-reviewer and \"neutral\" academic adviser. In this capacity Goldhill\u000a      gave three key-note addresses (2008, 2009, 2010) to this group on issues\u000a      of shared and sharing cultural heritage (including the now public lecture\u000a      April 2008 [5.4]).\u000a    Goldhill's involvement with PUSH between 2008-2010 also gave him the\u000a      opportunity to be influential through private meetings with leadership of\u000a      the Waqf, the Palestinian officials of the Jordanian authorities who run\u000a      the Haram al-Sharif\/Temple Mount, with planning department officials in\u000a      Jerusalem, and with Jordanian officials &#8212; particularly from the water\u000a      authorities (2008-2012). Goldhill's involvement took him to Jerusalem on\u000a      numerous occasions, especially in 2008-2012. When the project produced a\u000a      book, Our Shared Heritage, published in Arabic, English and\u000a      Hebrew, Goldhill contributed the afterword (2008) [5.5]. This book\u000a      presented the schedule of sites and the rationale for their treatment. It\u000a      was part of the programme that was instrumental in changing the policy and\u000a      producing new signage for sites in the region: for some highly contested\u000a      sites, three parallel signs were produced with different but interrelated\u000a      histories with wording agreed between the different communities. Other\u000a      sites (e.g. pilgrimage sites for one of the three Abrahamic faiths) were\u000a      linked by a single story, pointing out similar cultural practices across\u000a      the region. It is a measure of the importance and success of the\u000a      programme, and particularly of the neutrality established not least by\u000a      Goldhill's involvement, that the programme continued to meet after the\u000a      Palestinian official ban on meetings in response to the Gaza incursion.\u000a      The programme was presented as a success story by UNESCO at the 40th\u000a      Anniversary of the World Heritage Convention in November 2012 in Kyoto.\u000a      The discussion of the programme in an article in the UNESCO magazine Museum\u000a        International cited Goldhill's research-led contribution as\u000a      instrumental for the programme's success [5.6].\u000a    Because of his research and his part in the EU programme, Goldhill was\u000a      asked (2009) to meet and debate political and cultural issues with tour\u000a      guides and the trainers of tour guides in Jerusalem, in order to produce\u000a      more nuanced accounts of the sites visited. Goldhill was also invited to\u000a      meetings with leading Israeli and Palestinian archaeologists (2008, 2009).\u000a    More broadly, Goldhill's work has come to public attention in the UK and\u000a      USA. Goldhill presented his research in a Distinguished Lecture series as\u000a      the Schaffner Professor in Chicago in 2009; at Jewish Book Week in London\u000a      in 2011; at the 92nd Y at New York (a major educational and cultural\u000a      centre) in 2012; and at the British Museum (2012); and he has given over\u000a      thirty public talks on the Temple and its management since the publication\u000a      of his first book on the subject. These public events regularly attract\u000a      audiences of up to 500. Goldhill was also invited to give a master class\u000a      for UNESCO on urban planning in Jerusalem in 2010, to celebrate the UNESCO\u000a      international year of cultural rapprochement, and the inaugural address\u000a      for the new MA programme on urban design at the Bezalel Institute in\u000a      Jerusalem (Israel's premier art, architecture and design school) in 2009.\u000a    Since the close of his formal engagement with the project in 2010,\u000a      Goldhill has continued to be used as a reviewer for UNESCO projects in the\u000a      region, especially on potential museum and other cultural heritage areas.\u000a      In 2013, he was asked by the Deputy Director General for Culture, UNESCO\u000a      [5.7] to act as an independent reviewer for, and then to help\u000a      negotiate a redesign of, an exhibition on \"The Jews and the Land of\u000a      Israel\": this involved high-level negotiations with international\u000a      institute directors and public officials at UNESCO headquarters in Paris,\u000a      as well as remote reviewing and active engagement with the exhibition\u000a      designers. The exhibition, significantly altered following Goldhill's\u000a      criticisms, is scheduled to open in Paris in December 2013.\u000a    He has also continued to meet with relevant UNESCO and government\u000a      officials in an informal capacity. Sites of shared cultural heritage have\u000a      the potential to be major sources of conflict in this highly conflicted\u000a      region, and to be a cause of major misunderstanding. By taking his\u000a      research into the areas of policy, practice and public awareness Goldhill\u000a      has aimed to make a contribution to lowering levels of conflict and\u000a      increasing mutual understanding not just of the sites themselves but also\u000a      of the difficult and complex processes of sharing cultural heritage. As\u000a      the UNESCO chief representative for the region including Israel stated:\u000a      `His contribution was instrumental in moving towards achieving the goals\u000a      of the action in general and an innovative approach for new signs and\u000a      manuals of sites of shared cultural heritage, in particular. This also\u000a      strengthened the ongoing process of dialogue between different groups in\u000a      the process of the management of these sites.'

The bulk of the research underpinning this impact\u000a      study was conducted from 2003 to 2008 and published in two widely admired\u000a      books (2005, 2008).\u000a    The Temple of Jerusalem (2005) [below 3.1] attracted the\u000a      attention of the organisers of the EU project for three reasons. First, it\u000a      offered an account of the Temple at Jerusalem which, while\u000a      archaeologically sophisticated, did not attempt merely to reconstruct its\u000a      ancient form, but rather looked at how the Temple as a site had become a\u000a      building of the imagination, re-conceived and fought over across the ages.\u000a      Second, it was rare among treatments of sites in this region in that it\u000a      was sensitive to the histories of the three Abrahamic faiths, recognising,\u000a      in an even-handed manner, how the site has been highly significant to\u000a      different communities. Third, it treated art, literature and history\u000a      together, exploring how a site of cultural heritage is formed in the mind\u000a      and in the cultural products of different communities.\u000a    Jerusalem: City of Longing (2008) [3.2] is a guide to the\u000a      sites of cultural heritage of the city and continued the same agenda to\u000a      embrace the even more complex site of the city of Jerusalem itself. This\u000a      research involved Goldhill in many highly contentious areas of modern\u000a      historiography concerning the conflicts in the politics and history of\u000a      Israel, and discussions with many of the most active participants in the\u000a      battles over cultural heritage in the region. The book helped contribute\u000a      to the agenda of PUSH not only by its nuanced account of cultural sites,\u000a      but also by its refusal to mimic the tone of outrage and aggression that\u000a      mars so many accounts of the region. It is unique in telling the story of\u000a      the city through its sites of cultural heritage and their contested\u000a      understanding. Appreciating the archaeological, architectural and\u000a      historical context of sites is integral to their management and to\u000a      understanding their social and political significance as part of their\u000a      management. This research has continued with further detailed academic\u000a      work on Victorian Jerusalem in particular [3.3, 3.4], as\u000a      part of two major externally-funded academic projects at Cambridge, for\u000a      which Goldhill is a PI and grant-holder.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18017","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics has become the recognised leader in\u000d\u000a      the field of text commentary all over the world; the prescribed reading\u000d\u000a      and set texts in schools and colleges is often determined by the\u000d\u000a      availability of a volume in the `Green and Yellow' series. The series\u000d\u000a      offers reasonably priced, authoritative editions, which are always readily\u000d\u000a      available (volumes in the series do not go out of print). To meet the\u000d\u000a      needs of both individuals and libraries, they appear simultaneously in\u000d\u000a      both paper and hardback editions. Over the life of the series, some\u000d\u000a      312,000 volumes have been sold for c. &#163;3.6 million, of which c. &#163;2 m. is\u000d\u000a      export revenue for the British economy; in the current REF period, some\u000d\u000a      50,000 volumes have been sold, making at least &#163;500k in export revenue.\u000d\u000a      Sales are divided roughly equally between UK\/Europe and the USA\/Rest of\u000d\u000a      World, with particularly strong reach (apart from UK) in USA, Germany and\u000d\u000a      the Netherlands (Section 5.1).\u000d\u000a    The series has helped to change ideas about the `canon' of texts that are\u000d\u000a      central to the study of the ancient world and also available to readers at\u000d\u000a      all levels &#8212; major works of Hellenistic poetry and Plutarch, for example,\u000d\u000a      are now readily accessible, and in Latin, Lucan and Statius are examples\u000d\u000a      of poets now easily available to students, whereas before they were either\u000d\u000a      ignored or treated as marginal. Even major authors have enjoyed\u000d\u000a      reappraisal through appearing in the series: e.g. Kenney's Lucretius\u000d\u000a      3 (second edition, 2014) put that poet firmly on the student map. The\u000d\u000a      anthology format is used to allow readers to sample texts of great\u000d\u000a      interest (and at a suitable level) which are often ignored through\u000d\u000a      difficulty of access: e.g. Lucian (2008), Greek and Latin\u000d\u000a        Letters (2003).\u000d\u000a    The series has also broken down the traditional division between\u000d\u000a      `commentary' and `literary interpretation', both through the style of\u000d\u000a      commentary and through the choice of works precisely for their literary\u000d\u000a      interest and continuing significance, including their afterlife in western\u000d\u000a      culture: recently published examples include Homer, Iliad 6;\u000d\u000a      Sophocles, Antigone; Virgil, Aeneid 12 and Horace, Satires\u000d\u000a      1. The principal stated aim of the series is, `to provide the guidance\u000d\u000a      that the reader needs for the interpretation and understanding of the book\u000d\u000a      as a work of literature'. Readers come to see that linguistic and literary\u000d\u000a      interpretation are intimately inter-related.\u000d\u000a    Public recognition of the value and innovativeness of the series ranges\u000d\u000a      from a celebratory rap video on YouTube (5.2) to remarks by\u000d\u000a      Professor Denis Feeney (Princeton) in Times Literary Supplement\u000d\u000a      for 15 February, 2013, reviewing Horace, Satires 1 (Gowers &#8212;\u000d\u000a      submitted in REF2) and Virgil, Aeneid 12 (Tarrant), which he\u000d\u000a      describes as `outstanding commentaries ... remarkable standards of\u000d\u000a      scholarship and criticism ...

(5.4) A\u000d\u000a      Professor at Princeton has commented on the way in which: `the expansion\u000d\u000a      of the series with such volumes as \"Greek and Latin Letters\", which has\u000d\u000a      made it feasible (and affordable!) to teach new courses on subjects like\u000d\u000a      ancient epistolography and social history to undergraduates.

The series is\u000d\u000a      virtually unique in combining linguistic help for students with\u000d\u000a      sophisticated literary and cultural analysis, which also makes the volumes\u000d\u000a      required reading for scholars.\u000d\u000a    The General Editors devote considerable time and expertise to both the\u000d\u000a      substance and the style of consecutive drafts sent by individual authors,\u000d\u000a      paying particular attention to accessibility, clarity of exposition, the\u000d\u000a      explanation of linguistic and theoretical issues free from both jargon and\u000d\u000a      technical terms no longer in general currency, and a principal focus on\u000d\u000a      literary effects and their meaning. Recent years have seen greater\u000d\u000a      concentration on the explanation of grammar and syntax, in order to meet\u000d\u000a      the requirements of new audiences and wide adoption in schools. Particular\u000d\u000a      thought is given to the choice of texts and how individual texts will be\u000d\u000a      used in the classroom; Hunter 2002 (see Section 3 below) has discussed the\u000d\u000a      relationship between authorship and style of commentary. Euripides' Medea,\u000d\u000a      for example, is regularly the first tragedy read by learners of Greek: the\u000d\u000a      Green and Yellow edition devotes a special section, aimed at these\u000d\u000a      learners, to the explanation of ordinary features of tragic Greek and\u000d\u000a      tragic metre; these sections are regularly used by classes which are not\u000d\u000a      specifically reading the Medea.\u000d\u000a    The research (often of many years) involved in preparing a commentary for\u000d\u000a      the series requires not just a sophisticated command of the relevant\u000d\u000a      ancient and modern material, but also study of how to meet the aims of the\u000d\u000a      series; the series' success and international standing bring their own\u000d\u000a      demands and expectations, evidenced by, for example, the award in\u000d\u000a      2012-2013 of AHRC research leave and of Visiting Fellowships for work on\u000d\u000a      volumes for the series (`Greek lyric selection' and `Herodotus 1'\u000d\u000a      respectively).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18019","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2088628","Name":"Papua New Guinea"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research has led to impact in many forms and media:\u000d\u000a    1) The book itself has been widely read, reviewed and cited, and won the\u000d\u000a      Wolfson Prize for History (2009) (section 5:1).\u000d\u000a    2) BBC2 programme, Pompeii: Life and Death in a Roman Town (first\u000d\u000a      broadcast, December 2010). This programme, for which Beard was presenter\u000d\u000a      and script consultant, gained a UK audience on first broadcast of 3.4\u000d\u000a      million viewers (making it the top-rating BBC2 history programme of the\u000d\u000a      year); the consolidated audience with two repeats amounted to 6 million\u000d\u000a      viewers (5:2).

In addition to the\u000d\u000a      overall viewing figures, there were very positive reviews (`Wherever she\u000d\u000a      went, Beard broke a site apart and let knowledge flood out.' L. Mangan, Guardian;\u000d\u000a      5:5) and the series was shortlisted for a Broadcasting Press Guild\u000d\u000a      Award, 2013 (for the best documentary series). Beard has received hundreds\u000d\u000a      of emails and letters that confirm the impact of the programmes on the\u000d\u000a      learning of Latin; for example: `I am a first-year sixth-form student...\u000d\u000a      and I absolutely love Classics. I felt incredibly inspired [by the\u000d\u000a      programmes]...' (5:6). A recent letter confirms that a UK prisoner\u000d\u000a      has been brought to learn Latin thanks to the programmes. Beard's article\u000d\u000a      for the Daily Telegraph on visiting ancient Rome tied into the\u000d\u000a      series, won an ENIT (Italian Tourist Board) award for the best travel\u000d\u000a      article on Italy in a newspaper, 2012 (5:7). Beard has been\u000d\u000a      nominated for a 2013 Grierson award (\"the Oscars of the documentary\u000d\u000a      world\") for Meet the Romans (5:8).\u000d\u000a    4) Various digital versions of outreach material: including BBC website\u000d\u000a      \"tie-in\" discussion of a featured inscription (372,614 page-views on first\u000d\u000a      day; 5:9), BBC blog discussing Meet the Romans (`Mary, if I\u000d\u000a      had my time again, I would wish to come back as one of your classics\u000d\u000a      students'; 5.10); and British Museum blogs relating to BM objects\u000d\u000a      in the programme, directing people to them (`Fascinating!

For the 2013 British Museum exhibition, Life and Death in\u000d\u000a        Pompeii and Herculaneum, she was co-curator of outreach events (all\u000d\u000a      of them sold out), contributed to the multimedia guide, and was a lead\u000d\u000a      contributor to the first ever live-streaming to cinemas of a BM exhibition\u000d\u000a      (over 280 in the UK, and over 1000 worldwide; section 5:13).\u000d\u000a    7) This work has led directly to other forms of impact, including\u000d\u000a      appearances teaching Latin on Jamie Oliver's Channel 4 series Dream\u000d\u000a        School (2011). This had its own effect: e.g. `I have always loved\u000d\u000a      studying Classical Greek and Rome but family and work have left me with\u000d\u000a      little free time to pursue my interest. However, that all changed when I\u000d\u000a      saw you on the television series about Jamie Oliver and his Dream School.\u000d\u000a      I signed up with the Open University to complete my BA History and have\u000d\u000a      also taken the plunge to start my MA in Classics' (5:14). It was\u000d\u000a      also followed by an appearance at the House of Commons Education Select\u000d\u000a      Committee, in which the impact of Latin in the curriculum was discussed\u000d\u000a      (5:15).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    As a result of her outstanding research in Roman history and archaeology,\u000d\u000a      Beard was invited to work with a TV production company to develop two\u000d\u000a      programmes for BBC2. The first was a one-off programme specifically linked\u000d\u000a      to her book Pompeii (2008), the second a series (Meet the\u000d\u000a        Romans, 2011) related to her research on Pompeii and to her research\u000d\u000a      on Roman social history and inscriptions.

The main underpinning research is represented by Pompeii:\u000d\u000a        Life of a Roman Town (below 1). Pompeii was an\u000d\u000a      attempt to consolidate and develop recent work on the archaeology of\u000d\u000a      Pompeii within a more radical framework of recent advances in Roman social\u000d\u000a      history, to ask explicitly what contribution the material evidence makes\u000d\u000a      and to engage a wider audience with the history of the city. This was\u000d\u000a      augmented by a longstanding research interest in Roman social and cultural\u000d\u000a      history, and a series of papers on Roman epigraphy (4,5,6). These\u000d\u000a      have combined high-level technical expertise with a more nuanced, literary\u000d\u000a      reading of Roman tombstones and other epigraphic material, to demonstrate\u000d\u000a      the sophistication and complexity of these documents.\u000d\u000a    Pompeii was distinctive in uniting big research questions in Roman\u000d\u000a      history (the nature of slavery, of the Roman house, of urban social\u000d\u000a      structures) with a presentation that warmly welcomed a more general\u000d\u000a      audience. It asked directly how we understand the life of the ancient city\u000d\u000a      and with what difficulties; and how convincingly the material remains can\u000d\u000a      ever deliver conclusions on the major issues of Roman social history. This\u000d\u000a      was innovative in bringing together research into technical archaeological\u000d\u000a      issues on Pompeii with broader questions about ancient life. In addition,\u000d\u000a      Beard's epigraphical work has consistently tried to integrate the most\u000d\u000a      recent discoveries and re- interpretations into mainstream ancient history\u000d\u000a      and critical theory. One central concern of this work has been exactly how\u000d\u000a      to read Roman inscriptions, and this was developed within the\u000d\u000a      series Meet the Romans.\u000d\u000a    All this has been augmented by Beard's work on the modern reception of\u000d\u000a      the Vesuvian sites, which has shown how crucial it is to reflect on the\u000d\u000a      history of modern engagements with the story of Pompeii and Herculaneum in\u000d\u000a      order to understand their ancient history (2,3). This aspect of\u000d\u000a      Beard's work was itself underpinned by a Leverhulme research programme\u000d\u000a      grant (of which she was a joint PI) on \"Past versus Present in Victorian\u000d\u000a      Britain\".\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19037","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research has led to impact &#8212; in many forms and media &#8212; on:\u000d\u000a    1) the documentary, The Other Pompeii: Life and Death in Herculaneum,\u000d\u000a      that focused on Herculaneum, commissioned for BBC2: transmitted 1 April\u000d\u000a      2013, repeated 2 April, 17 June, 1 August and 17 September; consolidated\u000d\u000a      viewing figures of 2.71 million, average audience rating 88\/100 (Section\u000d\u000a      5.1).

By undertaking a\u000d\u000a      fundamental reassessment of the received interpretations of the ancient\u000d\u000a      city of Herculaneum (largely based on the excavations of the middle\u000d\u000a      decades of the twentieth century), and drawing on the results of new\u000d\u000a      discoveries made in the course of the Herculaneum Conservation Project\u000d\u000a      under Wallace-Hadrill's direction, this research offers a new\u000d\u000a      understanding of Herculaneum as a Roman community &#8212; its public spaces and\u000d\u000a      its private structures, residential and commercial.\u000d\u000a    Herculaneum: Past and Future has also drawn attention to the\u000d\u000a      severe neglect of the site, in terms both of the failure of the heritage\u000d\u000a      authorities to maintain and conserve it, and the failure of archaeological\u000d\u000a      research to exploit it, or of archaeologists to bring it to proper public\u000d\u000a      awareness. This formed the basis of Wallace-Hadrill's argument for the\u000d\u000a      importance of the site as a uniquely well-preserved case study of Roman\u000d\u000a      society, and hence the urgency of steps to preserve it. Deliberately\u000d\u000a      addressing a wider public, the monograph sought to raise the profile of\u000d\u000a      the site and stimulate public interest, and to make the case for the\u000d\u000a      pressing need to focus on the conservation problems.

It is a central argument of Herculaneum\u000d\u000a      that advocacy of such sites is fundamental to their management and\u000d\u000a      conservation, securely underpinned by the scientific and academic research\u000d\u000a      that Wallace-Hadrill and his team have carried out.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20052","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research at Oxford on papyri has had significant impact in a wide range\u000a      of cultural and pedagogical areas.

Together these websites (which are each visited by\u000a      about 125,000 users per week) bring the most important repository of Greek\u000a      literature and social history face to face with a global audience[i].\u000a      Displaying this vast collection of papyrus fragments online has created a\u000a      new channel for Classics outreach and education: Obbink's team answers\u000a      frequent questions and advises users about learning ancient Greek, the\u000a      fundamental principles of studying ancient manuscripts and the Classics in\u000a      general. The Ancient Lives project has also intelligently embraced\u000a      social media, such as blogging and Twitter, to communicate with an\u000a      entirely new audience and generation[ii]. Owing to\u000a      advances in digital technology and the internet, it has succeeded in\u000a      facilitating public access to the Oxyrhynchus Papyri collection to an\u000a      unprecedented degree.\u000a    The Ancient Lives project offers a new platform for\u000a      inter-cultural communication that goes beyond academic collaboration and\u000a      extends beyond the traditional scholarly community. Under Obbink's\u000a      research leadership, the development of the Ancient Lives website\u000a      has enabled a wide non-academic audience to participate in the\u000a      transcription of papyri. Since August 2011, it has recorded well over 1.5\u000a      million transcriptions of the Oxyrhynchus papyri, the work of over 250,000\u000a      online collaborators. Within the first months of the launching of the\u000a      project, online users helped identify important fragments of authors such\u000a      as Simonides, Plutarch, Menander, and Euripides. Email testimonials\u000a      available range from `a paralegal with a love for the written word and a\u000a      passion for history' who writes that `I'm excited to know that I can\u000a      actually help to further the world's knowledge of our past'[1]\u000a      to the mother of an 8-year-old boy in Glasgow seeking advice about the\u000a      on-line Greek keyboard.

There is\u000a      keen interest in the papyri from continuing education programmes and\u000a      secondary schools: project staff respond by giving talks, often\u000a      illustrated by original papyri. Feedback on such talks includes the\u000a      comment: `The talk you gave us yesterday was one of the most interesting I\u000a      have ever been to, and we were all very excited indeed when you gave us\u000a      the papyri to look at. The girls have been approaching me all day telling\u000a      me how informative and fascinating it was (it seems that some of us have\u000a      found a new opportunity in the studying of ancient ink!). ...

As a result of this publicity and\u000a      the new website, requests to tour the papyrology rooms of the Oxyrhynchus\u000a      Papyri Project, housed in the Sackler Library of the Ashmolean Museum,\u000a      have increased over the last two years from an average of twenty per year,\u000a      not counting visits by representatives from the media, to forty.\u000a    For the past four years the Oxyrhynchus project has also hosted and\u000a      directed, at the request of their schools, two qualified work-experience\u000a      sixth-formers per year. It thus involves students engaged in learning\u000a      Latin and Greek at secondary level in the ongoing hands-on cataloguing and\u000a      processing of ancient documents written in those languages from the\u000a      Oxyrhynchus collection, and they in turn provide the project with valuable\u000a      feedback on user-access to the collection and provision of online and\u000a      other resources, and testing of the Ancient Lives interface.\u000a    The papyri and their texts enjoy an increasing interest in the news\u000a      media, and have been the subject of many newspaper articles and radio and\u000a      television documentaries in recent years; nationally, these include BBC\u000a      Radio and television documentaries on Oxyrhynchus, and include other\u000a      productions in the USA, Australia, and elsewhere[v].\u000a      Obbink was interviewed for a television documentary by Michael Wood about\u000a      a papyrus identified by the project as offering new evidence on the\u000a      location of Alexander the Great's victory at Gaugamela. Obbink has also\u000a      appeared in television interviews with Bettany Hughes on the topics of\u000a      women and science in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri and the role played by women\u000a      in the early church through the medieval period, and in a radio discussion\u000a      with Marina Warner on links between a story found in the Oxyrhynchus\u000a      papyri and Grimms' Fairy Tales[vi].\u000a    Oxford papyrological researchers have also achieved cultural and\u000a      pedagogical impact in other areas:\u000a    \u000a      The Oxyrhynchus Papyri Project has hosted public workshops (each\u000a        attended by c. 200 people) at the British Academy and the Egypt\u000a        Exploration Society showcasing work in progress and important texts\u000a        identified by the project, discussed by invited specialists[vii].\u000a      Peter Parsons' research on the cultural life of Oxyrhynchus has\u000a        achieved impact through the success of his popular 2007 book, City\u000a          of the Sharp-nosed Fish. This book was awarded two prizes for\u000a        popular scholarship in 2008, the John D.

This collection of mainly Greek literary\u000a      (books) and documentary texts (i.e. texts of daily life: business records,\u000a      personal letters, receipts for taxes paid, notices of births and deaths)\u000a      has been responsible for extending and improving our knowledge of Greek\u000a      and Roman literature, philosophy, history, medicine, and mathematics, as\u000a      well as early Christian theology and life. The vast majority of these\u000a      texts are papyrus fragments, broken texts and scraps that were thrown away\u000a      into one of several garbage dumps outside the city walls. Consequently,\u000a      the work involved in reading and interpreting papyri is arduous and\u000a      complex.\u000a    Parsons' research consisted in the detailed editing and analysis of\u000a      numerous papyri from Oxyrhynchus over the course of his scholarly career.\u000a      Through this research, Parsons was able to recreate the life and culture\u000a      of a once flourishing Egyptian market town, presenting a detailed\u000a      description of some of the economic, religious, educational, legal,\u000a      financial, administrative and personal concerns which Oxyrhynchus'\u000a      inhabitants chose to commit to writing. His research was published as a\u000a      monograph in 2007 in a style accessible to a non-specialist audience.\u000a    One particularly notable literary papyrus (though not in the Oxyrhynchus\u000a      collection) published by an Oxford scholar in recent years is West's\u000a      reconstruction in 2005 of what is one of the very few complete poems by\u000a      Sappho known to us. This form of papyrological research involves expert\u000a      knowledge of ancient scripts, Greek lyric poetry, and the Greek\u000a      mythological tradition. West published his research in a leading academic\u000a      papyrological journal, and also wrote a piece on the Sappho poem for the Times\u000a        Literary Supplement, with accompanying translation.\u000a    Obbink has taken research into the Oxyrhynchus papyri into new directions\u000a      with two major Digital Humanities projects, Oxyrhynchus Online and\u000a      Ancient Lives. This research (done in collaboration with Dr Chris\u000a      Lintott of the Department of Astrophysics at Oxford, with Obbink as PI)\u000a      consisted of imaging individual papyrus fragments (numbering in the\u000a      millions), developing computational methods for processing and extracting\u000a      image data from photographs, and creating an interactive website and\u000a      database to collect and algorithmically process digital transcriptions of\u000a      the papyri. This project has expedited and improved the process of\u000a      transcribing, cataloguing and identifying the vast quantity of remaining\u000a      texts. It has resulted in the development of new ways to study ancient\u000a      texts through the merging of human and machine intelligence.\u000a    The research that went into the creation of these digital projects has in\u000a      turn fostered further research on the papyri themselves. As a result of\u000a      the successful implementation of the Ancient Lives website, Obbink\u000a      was able to oversee development of a consensus algorithm to process the\u000a      multiple transcriptions of a given fragment. This linear-sequencing\u000a      algorithm transforms user input into a line-by-line Greek text useable\u000a      within a text editor and a cataloguing interface that organizes the\u000a      transcriptions and allows for the input of key metadata. The\u000a      interdisciplinary nature of the project enables the use of these coding\u000a      algorithms that were originally designed for research communities in\u000a      astrophysics and bioinformatics. A further off-shoot of the project was\u000a      the introduction a cost-effective portable scanner for studying ancient\u000a      manuscripts with multi-spectral imaging capability (MSI), the economic and\u000a      cultural impact of which is described in a separate case study.\u000a    The key researchers are:\u000a    \u000aProfessor Peter Parsons, Regius Professor of Greek, Christ Church, Oxford,\u000a      1989-2003; since 2003, Emeritus Professor.\u000a    Dr Dirk Obbink, Official Student (Tutorial Fellow) in Greek, Christ\u000a      Church, Oxford and University Lecturer in Papyrology and Greek Literature\u000a      (1995-present), Director of The Oxyrhynchus Papyri Project (2005-2010) and\u000a      subsequently Co-director (2010-present), and a General Editor of The\u000a        Oxyrhynchus Papyri series.\u000a    Dr Martin L.

Media interest in these\u000a      developments has brought about greater public understanding of the use of\u000a      scientific techniques within the Humanities.\u000a    Obbink's digital research has led to the creation of an Advanced\u000a      Multi-spectral Imaging Laboratory in the Papyrology Rooms of the Sackler\u000a      Library. This has led to an important economic impact through the creation\u000a      of Oxford Multi Spectral Ltd, the company that produces the scanners. In\u000a      addition to the grant funding required to develop the scanner for\u000a      research, and a grant from the University Challenge Seed Fund for\u000a      prototyping work, the company attracted an initial investment of &#163;400,000\u000a      from a Chinese investor Changsha Yaodong Investment Consulting Co and its\u000a      UK based partner RTC Innovations, enabling it to commercialise,\u000a      manufacture, and market the scanners globally.

As described more fully in a separate case-study\u000a      submitted by this Unit, multispectral images produced by the scanner were\u000a      included in the online interface of the AHRC Ancient Lives Project (www.ancientlives.org),\u000a      where hundreds of thousands of volunteer transcribers helped to determine\u000a      by statistical analysis exactly where and to what degree multispectral\u000a      images offered an improved record of legibility over conventional images.\u000a      Although the scanner was developed for imaging ancient papyri, the\u000a      technology has been used to successfully scan, restore and archive over a\u000a      half-million historically significant archival documents. The scanner is\u000a      able to detect an artist or writer's signature under multiple layers of\u000a      paint or a pencil sketch under a watercolour.\u000a    Examples of its use include:\u000a    \u000a      Enabling the reading of a poem by Archilochus that is now used in the\u000a        teaching of Greek literature in Universities and discussed by online\u000a        groups.[i]\u000a        [text removed for publication]\u000a      Recovering one of the oldest Hebrew commentaries on the Old Testament\u000a        (now in the Bodleian Library), which dates from the 10th century AD, and\u000a        was rendered illegible in the late 19th century during\u000a        chemical attempts to make it more readable.

The scanner has been\u000a      variously used, from recovering the inked out names of parents on orphan's\u000a      birth records to comparing bank notes and passports with reference\u000a      documents of known reflective properties. The business impact of the\u000a      scanner was underscored by Paul Westwood, Managing Director of Forensic\u000a      Document Services, the largest forensic document company in the Asia\u000a      Pacific, who has stated that `the portable nature of the scanner means\u000a      that it is a great resource when document examiners are required to\u000a      undertake examinations out of the laboratory environment, such as at Court\u000a      Registries or the offices of opposing lawyers.'[iii]\u000a    Models of the Oxford Multi Spectral scanner are now in use or under\u000a      development in locations as far afield as the University of California\u000a      Berkeley's Center for the Study of the Tebtunis Papyri, Baylor\u000a      University's collection of historic Robert Browning manuscripts (to read\u000a      Browning's notes on Greek texts), the Thomas Jefferson papers in the\u000a      Special Collections Room of the Library of the University of Virginia (to\u000a      enable the decipherment of badly faded hand-written documents from the\u000a      papers of Thomas Jefferson),[1] The Library of Congress\u000a      (for conservation purposes), the US Postal Service (fraud detection), the\u000a      National Archives, Washington DC (to read invisible watermarks), and the\u000a      Thames Valley Police Force's fingerprint detection and analysis\u000a      departments (for detection of fingerprints on bank-notes)[4],\u000a      as well as widely across several provinces in China, where it is employed\u000a      mainly in document verification, immigration, and forensics[5].\u000a    Public understanding\u000a    The technology developed in Oxford has also received much media attention\u000a      and other forms of coverage, including articles in the Economist[iv],\u000a      the Wall Street Journal[v], and business\u000a      technology websites[vi].

The\u000a      scanner, which uses innovative patented LED technology at different levels\u000a      of the light spectrum, was developed under funding from ISIS, Oxford\u000a      University's technology transfer division.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    University of Oxford\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1815577","Name":"Changsha"},{"GeoNamesId":"3170335","Name":"Pompei"},{"GeoNamesId":"1819729","Name":"Hong Kong"}],"References":"\u000a    The key outputs are:\u000a    Multispectral Desktop Document Scanner, produced by Oxford Multi Spectral\u000a      Ltd\u000a      (http:\/\/www.oxfordmultispectral.com)\u000a    `Advanced Multispectral Imaging at Oxford' at: http:\/\/163.1.169.223\/MSI\/welcome.html.\u000a    Ancient Lives project website: http:\/\/www.ancientlives.org\u000a    \u000aD.

Research into ancient manuscripts has\u000a      developed the ability to detect traces of faded or hidden inks and paints\u000a      in historical manuscripts, to analyse documents and art works for physical\u000a      components or authenticity, and to explore forensic evidence such as\u000a      fingerprints and stains. The technology, known as Multi-spectral imaging,\u000a      scans objects at 16 different levels both within and beyond the visible\u000a      spectrum of light. By this means details can be captured not normally\u000a      visible by the human eye. The technology led to the discovery of new poems\u000a      by the 7th century BC Greek poets Archilochus and Sappho and\u000a      philosophical treatises by the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus from\u000a      Herculaneum.\u000a    In addition the identification and decipherment of hundreds of\u000a      manuscripts through improved readings and image enhancement has been made\u000a      possible through public participation in the Ancient Lives crowd-sourcing\u000a      project and the Friends of Herculaneum Society, a registered charity (no.\u000a      1107134) and Classics Faculty research project. These include hundreds of\u000a      previously unknown works of literature from Graeco-Roman Egypt and from\u000a      the Villa of the Papyri on the Bay of Naples in Italy. Data produced by\u000a      imaging of the manuscripts and crowd-sourced transcriptions was used to\u000a      perfect a new type of scanner in a manuscript imaging laboratory. Over\u000a      500,000 individual images were created and analysed by editorial and\u000a      algorithmic methods to optimise results. By layering the images on top of\u000a      each other, the software enabled a more detailed analysis of the writing,\u000a      in particular through the interrogation of particular features such as the\u000a      surface structure, fibres, and ink; on modern documents, features include\u000a      stains, watermarks, fingerprints, and alterations.\u000a    The imaging system was then miniaturized by application of a patented LED\u000a      technology and housed in an ordinary desktop scanner unit. The system is\u000a      able to detect which surfaces or pigments, e.g. carbon or iron-gall ink or\u000a      paint, provide the best contrast &#8212; even with a dark background &#8212; by its\u000a      behaviour in either the infra-red or ultra-violet range of the light\u000a      spectrum, or where the clearest picture emerges by combining images from\u000a      several frequencies. Programming was written to enable an easy-to-use\u000a      interface with simplified enhancement routines for use by office or lab\u000a      workers or in the home. As the unit is portable, it can be used in the\u000a      field: in a foreign library or museum, on an archaeological site, or on a\u000a      crime scene.\u000a    A technology transfer grant from the University's spinout division ISIS\u000a      Innovation facilitated the patenting of the technology and the formation\u000a      of a company structure. The technology attracted the University's first\u000a      Chinese investor, a property and imaging company based in Beijing, who\u000a      partnered with the University and the researchers to form the limited\u000a      company, Oxford Multi Spectral Ltd., which markets the device and engages\u000a      in further development of the product and related systems for the scanner\u000a      market.\u000a    The key researcher is Dr Dirk Obbink, Official Student (Tutorial Fellow)\u000a      in Greek, Christ Church, Oxford and University Lecturer in Papyrology and\u000a      Greek Literature (1995-present), Director of the Ancient Lives Project,\u000a      Trustee of the Herculaneum Society, and Founding Director of Oxford Multi\u000a      Spectral Ltd.

The level of worldwide sales and number of book translations\u000d\u000a      indicate the reach of the\u000d\u000a      impact via the underpinning research. The 3rd (and revised 3rd\u000d\u000a      edition) of OCD has been translated\u000d\u000a      into three other languages (Georgian, Modern Greek, and Chinese), and now\u000d\u000a      in its fourth edition, it\u000d\u000a      has also been translated into Spanish, with a planned Chinese translation.\u000d\u000a      OCD3 and OCD4 have\u000d\u000a      had total sales of nearly 70,000 copies, with more than 10,000 of these\u000d\u000a      sold after 2008 (this\u000d\u000a      includes sales of over 3,000 of OCD4 in its first year\u000d\u000a      of publication). Almost 40% of total sales come\u000d\u000a      from outside the UK (IMP1). Given the significant cost of\u000d\u000a      purchasing these reference books, copies\u000d\u000a      purchased prior to 2008 will still be in use by individuals, educational\u000d\u000a      establishments and library\u000d\u000a      users.\u000d\u000a    Driven by the high sales response to OCD3, Oxford\u000d\u000a      University Press commissioned two spin-off\u000d\u000a      publications and Spawforth had a pivotal role in each of these. The\u000d\u000a        Oxford Companion to Classical\u000d\u000a        Civilisation (Companion) is an anthology of the 3rd edition of OCD,\u000d\u000a      with extensive illustrations, and\u000d\u000a      has been published in both hardback (1998) and paperback (2004). Spawforth\u000d\u000a      was co-responsible\u000d\u000a      for identifying and editing suitable entries and approving and choosing\u000d\u000a      illustrations. Spawforth was\u000d\u000a      also co-responsible for identifying and editing suitable entries in the Who's\u000d\u000a        Who in the Classical\u000d\u000a        World (Who's Who), which was published in paperback (1998) as an\u000d\u000a      accessible reference work\u000d\u000a      focused on historical individuals from classical antiquity. Through\u000d\u000a      changing the style of the way the\u000d\u000a      material is presented and being considerably cheaper than the OCD\u000d\u000a      editions, the aim of these\u000d\u000a      spin-off publications was to reach wider and more diverse audiences,\u000d\u000a      thereby extending the reach\u000d\u000a      of public understanding of the classical world. The OCD spin-offs\u000d\u000a      collectively have also had sales\u000d\u000a      of over 75,000 copies. Companion has had sales of 68,846 copies of\u000d\u000a      which around 15% were\u000d\u000a      outside the UK, and has been translated into Chinese. Who's Who\u000d\u000a      has sold 7,049 copies and just\u000d\u000a      over 75% were sales outside the UK (IMP1). Both editions of OCD\u000d\u000a      and its spin-off publications are\u000d\u000a      also available electronically at www.oxfordreference.com\u000d\u000a      and are accessed via schools, colleges,\u000d\u000a      universities and public libraries. The total revenue generated from the OCD3\u000d\u000a      and OCD4 via this\u000d\u000a      medium is over &#163;50,000 (around &#163;20,000 of this is from OCD4)\u000d\u000a      (IMP1). Though figures presented\u000d\u000a      are lifetime sales (and include sales prior to 2008), these publications\u000d\u000a      continue to have an on-going\u000d\u000a      impact and currency.\u000d\u000a    The reach of the impact is evidenced by the sheer number of libraries\u000d\u000a      these publications can be\u000d\u000a      accessed through worldwide, covering 33 countries worldwide. OCD3\u000d\u000a      and\/or OCD4 is available in\u000d\u000a      hard copy or electronically in more than 4,000 libraries, Companion\u000d\u000a      in more than 1,500 libraries,\u000d\u000a      and Who's Who in more than 600 libraries. These libraries are\u000d\u000a      based in universities and colleges,\u000d\u000a      as well as on army bases and in museums, and include public libraries. For\u000d\u000a      example, at least one\u000d\u000a      of these publications is available in one or more public libraries in all\u000d\u000a      50 states in America, and in\u000d\u000a      other countries such as the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the\u000d\u000a      Netherlands and Singapore\u000d\u000a      (IMP2).\u000d\u000a    OCD and\/or the spin-off publications are also available in a\u000d\u000a      number of school libraries, particularly\u000d\u000a      in the United States of America, for instance in the Harvard Westlake\u000d\u000a      School in California, the\u000d\u000a      Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, and the Abraham Lincoln High School in\u000d\u000a      New York (IMP2).\u000d\u000a      OCD3 is also suggested as a resource for 6th\u000d\u000a      grade study of ancient Greece by the New York\u000d\u000a      Department of Education Office of Curriculum, Standards and Academic\u000d\u000a      Engagement (IMP3).\u000d\u000a    Where Greek, Latin or Classical Studies are taught in English at a\u000d\u000a      university level, OCD3 and\/or\u000d\u000a      OCD4 are very likely to be held in the university\u000d\u000a      library, and this is also likely to be the case for one\u000d\u000a      or both of the OCD spin-offs. For example, the Universities of\u000d\u000a      Cape Town, Sydney, Harvard and\u000d\u000a      Cambridge all hold OCD and one or both spin-off publications (IMP2).\u000d\u000a      The OCD is also listed as a\u000d\u000a      key reference on undergraduate modules on a range of topics, such as:\u000d\u000a      Theology and Religious\u000d\u000a      Studies, Archaeology, Classics and History, in the UK and beyond. For\u000d\u000a      example, it is listed in the\u000d\u000a      module guide for `History of Ancient Greece and Rome', for the BA in\u000d\u000a      Archaeology, at the Institute\u000d\u000a      of Archaeology at the University of Warsaw. OCD is also cited as a\u000d\u000a      reference tool on courses in\u000d\u000a      skills development, for examples, in an Open University course on creative\u000d\u000a      writing for Classics\u000d\u000a      students, and a research skills and referencing courses at the University\u000d\u000a      of Exeter. The OCD spin-\u000d\u000a      off publications are also listed as set texts or background reading on a\u000d\u000a      number of modules, for\u000d\u000a      example, the Oxford Companion to Classical Civilisation is\u000d\u000a      recommended on an Open University\u000d\u000a      level 2 undergraduate course, `Exploring the Classical World' (IMP4).\u000d\u000a      According to Google Scholar,\u000d\u000a      OCD has been cited more than 500 times, although this is a poor\u000d\u000a      guide to citation-frequency, since\u000d\u000a      academics who consult OCD and its spin-offs do not invariably\u000d\u000a      acknowledge the fact in research\u000d\u000a      (or other) publications (IMP5).\u000d\u000a    The worldwide use of OCD and spin-off publications signifies the reach\u000d\u000a      and significance of its\u000d\u000a      impact, which rests on its authoritative scholarship and its combined\u000d\u000a      function of preserving the old\u000d\u000a      while signalling what is new in the Classics discipline. The OCD\u000d\u000a      is the premier English language\u000d\u000a      reference tool for the ancient world and was described by the Library\u000d\u000a      Journal as \"...rich, varied,\u000d\u000a        and highly reliable...this magnificent work will form the cornerstone of\u000d\u000a        any institutional or home-\u000d\u000a        based Classical studies library...an indispensable reference for\u000d\u000a        individuals and libraries alike\"\u000d\u000a      (IMP6), and in the Modern Language Association (MLA) Literary\u000d\u000a      Research Guide as \"Authoritative\u000d\u000a        and informative, the work is the best single-volume classical dictionary\u000d\u000a        in English and an essential\u000d\u000a        desktop reference. It truly has, as its editors claim, `no competitor in\u000d\u000a        any language'\" (IMP7).\u000d\u000a    Peter Green from the Washington Times said that OCD3 \"offers\u000d\u000a        not only that breakfast for the mind\u000d\u000a        that we keep hearing about, but lunch, tea, dinner, supper and non-stop\u000d\u000a        snacks...[and] offers a\u000d\u000a        cornucopia of accurate and succinct knowledge that would be hard to\u000d\u000a        equal\" (IMP8). A recent\u000d\u000a      review of OCD4 stated that \"it's the scholarship of\u000d\u000a        the OCD that justifies its continued publication...\"\u000d\u000a      and that the contributors \"represent the best of living classical\u000d\u000a        thought combined with the\u000d\u000a        intellectual legacy of dead contributors\". Harry Mount's review `The\u000d\u000a      Classical World Just Refuses\u000d\u000a      to Stay Dead', also acknowledges OCD's role in tracking the\u000d\u000a      developments in the classical world,\u000d\u000a      as well as recognising that its line-up of scholars, chief advisers and\u000d\u000a      editors reflect \"the make-up of\u000d\u000a        modern classical scholarship\". It also states that \"Classical\u000d\u000a        scholarship in this country is on the\u000d\u000a        wane...the old standards survive on remote islands like the OCD\" (IMP9).\u000d\u000a    In summary, public understanding of the classical world has been informed\u000d\u000a      and enhanced by the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research though the 3rd and 4th\u000d\u000a      editions of OCD and spin-off publications, which are\u000d\u000a      available all over the world to the general public, school children and\u000d\u000a      teachers, scholars and other\u000d\u000a      professionals. The reach and significance of the impact is evidenced by\u000d\u000a      the extent of the on-going\u000d\u000a      sales of the publications across the world, as well as their continued\u000d\u000a      availability in libraries in 33\u000d\u000a      countries worldwide thereby bringing research and expert knowledge to a\u000d\u000a      range of people globally.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Public understanding of the classical world has been informed and\u000d\u000a      enhanced through new editions\u000d\u000a      of the prestigious and internationally acclaimed Oxford Classical\u000d\u000a        Dictionary (OCD) and its spin-off\u000d\u000a      publications.

Based on a growing\u000d\u000a      international reputation in the\u000d\u000a      history and material culture of ancient Greece, Antony Spawforth\u000d\u000a      (Professor of Ancient History,\u000d\u000a      2001 to present) was approached to co-editor on both the 3rd\u000d\u000a      and 4th editions, with a key role in\u000d\u000a      marshalling and editing the research driven scholarship which underpins\u000d\u000a      the broader impact being\u000d\u000a      claimed in this case study (1, 2).\u000d\u000a    Spawforth was directly responsible for revising and writing 250 entries\u000d\u000a      in both editions, which were\u000d\u000a      based on his research and outputs. For example, in OCD4\u000d\u000a      Spawforth's entries on `Sparta' and\u000d\u000a      `Sparta, topography' were based on his research and many publications\u000d\u000a      about ancient Sparta, its\u000d\u000a      history and epigraphy, over thirty years (3); his entry on `court'\u000d\u000a      was informed by the British-Academy\u000d\u000a      funded interdisciplinary research project which he led, with a book-length\u000d\u000a      publication,\u000d\u000a      including his Introduction and a chapter on the court of Alexander the\u000d\u000a      Great (4); and the entry for\u000d\u000a      `Persian-Wars tradition' was grounded in his research on this subject\u000d\u000a      going back to a paper for an\u000d\u000a      Oxford seminar in the early 1990s and culminating in a chapter-length\u000d\u000a      treatment in his latest book\u000d\u000a      (5). Other Newcastle scholars were invited to contribute to both\u000d\u000a      dictionary editions because of the\u000d\u000a      recognised expertise upon which the reputation of the volume depends.\u000d\u000a      These scholars based\u000d\u000a      their entries on their research and academic outputs. For example, in OCD3\u000d\u000a      and OCD4, Rowland\u000d\u000a      Smith's (Lecturer in Ancient History, 1992 to present) entry on `Julian'\u000d\u000a      is based on his Oxford DPhil\u000d\u000a      which in turn became a published as a book (6).\u000d\u000a    Research also underpinned the editorial of the dictionary. OCD3\u000d\u000a      was originally published in 1996,\u000d\u000a      and was twice republished in 1998 (with corrections) and 2003 (with slight\u000d\u000a      revisions) (1). Spawforth\u000d\u000a      co-edited this edition with Simon Hornblower, and they aimed to retain the\u000d\u000a      strengths of the 2nd\u000d\u000a      edition (published in 1970), whilst developing OCD to take account\u000d\u000a      of advances in Classics since\u000d\u000a      the 1960s. In all 6250 entries by 364 contributors, OCD3\u000d\u000a      is 30% longer than OCD2. For example, a\u000d\u000a      shift from the teaching of traditional Classics to a greater focus on\u000d\u000a      Classical Studies or Classical\u000d\u000a      Civilisation led to use of a more thematic approach to OCD3\u000d\u000a      and the creation of new entries to\u000d\u000a      acknowledge key discourses and whole new sub-disciplines, i.e.\u000d\u000a      Women's\/Gender Studies, that\u000d\u000a      were not represented in the previous edition. The overall aim of both\u000d\u000a      editors was to maintain\u000d\u000a      OCD's position as the most authoritative one-volume reference work\u000d\u000a      to classical antiquity in\u000d\u000a      English. OCD4 was published in 2012, revised and\u000d\u000a      updated using the latest developments in the\u000d\u000a      field of Classics, with 6,700 entries by 400 contributors (2).\u000d\u000a      Once again Spawforth co-edited with\u000d\u000a      Hornblower, with Esther Eidinow as Assistant Editor.\u000d\u000a    As co-editor Spawforth was co-responsible for:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Taking direct editorial responsibility with Simon Hornblower for Greek\u000d\u000a        and Roman history,\u000d\u000a        historiography, historical individuals, institutions, topography,\u000d\u000a        archaeology and art, which\u000d\u000a        constitute over half of the dictionary (both editions).\u000d\u000a      Defining general principles, such as conceiving the kind of updating\u000d\u000a        that was needed, in\u000d\u000a        terms of updating outdated information and identifying new directions\u000d\u000a        for the dictionary.\u000d\u000a        This involved the inclusion of many more thematic entries and the\u000d\u000a        promotion of whole\u000d\u000a        subject areas (i.e. Near East, Jewish Studies, Women's Studies in OCD3),\u000d\u000a        identifying new\u000d\u000a        emphases (i.e. anthropology and reception studies in OCD4),\u000d\u000a        as well as promoting\u000d\u000a        accessibility without losing academic quality.\u000d\u000a      Identifying and assembling the area advisors.\u000d\u000a      Approaching the c360 contributors and overseeing the follow-up\u000d\u000a        process.\u000d\u000a      Editing (and occasionally translating) the entries as they were\u000d\u000a        submitted by the\u000d\u000a        contributors.\u000d\u000a      Generally steering the process to conclusion, including on-going\u000d\u000a        extensive liaising with\u000d\u000a        individual area advisors and contributors.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The editorial role throughout required academic decisions at every turn,\u000d\u000a      from being able to take a\u000d\u000a      large overview of the state of the subject c1990; knowing from personal\u000d\u000a      expertise where there\u000d\u000a      were gaps in coverage, or new finds, or new scholarly developments etc;\u000d\u000a      knowing who the best\u000d\u000a      expert was to approach (and who the next-best in the event of a refusal);\u000d\u000a      knowing how best to edit\u000d\u000a      entries as they came in (not a matter of mere sub-editing, but of academic\u000d\u000a      judgments about factual\u000d\u000a      accuracy, about significant omissions which a contributor should be asked\u000d\u000a      to rectify, about where\u000d\u000a      to cut, as well as translation of Ancient Greek and Latin and, in\u000d\u000a      Spawforth's case, translation of\u000d\u000a      whole entries from French into English).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21732","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has had impact through enhancing public understanding of the\u000a      ancient Greek and\u000a      Etruscan past, and informing education outside the HEI and academy.\u000a      Beneficiaries include\u000a      hundreds of thousands of museum visitors as well as thousands of\u000a      school-age children.\u000a    Enhancing Public Understanding of the Ancient Greek and Etruscan Past\u000a    The GNM opened in May 2009, supported by an investment of &#163;26m from\u000a      funders including the\u000a      Heritage Lottery Fund. The decision by the funders to include the Shefton\u000a      collection in the new\u000a      museum underlined its importance as a research asset and educational\u000a      resource, and along with\u000a      the Roman display and Hatton Gallery, thereby gave the GNM university\u000a      research status and\u000a      access to HEFCE funding totalling &#163;920,148 since 2009 (IMP1). The\u000a      research fundamentally\u000a      shaped the ancient Greek display in the GNM as research insights were used\u000a      in the labelling and\u000a      interpretation of the objects, creating meaning and context for visitors.\u000a      The GNM Manager\u000a      confirmed how the research influenced the museum's Keeper of Archaeology\u000a      who curated the\u000a      display: \"the development of the Shefton Gallery in the Great North\u000a        Museum was indebted to the\u000a        research and collection's knowledge of Professor Brian Shefton [...] one\u000a        example of the way in\u000a        which Brian's research informed the display is the location of the\u000a        Rhodian bronze oinochoe in the\u000a        Etruscan case. These vessels are frequently considered to be of Greek\u000a        manufacture but, after\u000a        much study of this particular category of bronze vessel, Brian became\u000a        convinced that they were\u000a        Etruscan in origin. His research therefore influenced our decision about\u000a        where to display this\u000a        object. There are numerous other examples of where Brian's work\u000a        influenced the choices made in\u000a        the Shefton Gallery. In fact we made several alterations to the Gallery\u000a        after the GNM opened as a\u000a        result of conversations with Brian\" (IMP2). When the\u000a      collection moved from the Shefton Museum in\u000a      the university's Armstrong Building to the GNM, it increased the\u000a      visibility of the collection. Visitor\u000a      figures to the GNM have been exceptional with more than 2.1 million\u000a      visitors since opening (IMP3).\u000a      This represents a major increase in visitors compared to the previous\u000a      display. The GNM is a major\u000a      part of the creative economy of the North East and beyond. In geographical\u000a      terms, 31% of visitors\u000a      to Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums (TWAM) museums and galleries in 2011\u000a      came from\u000a      outside Tyne and Wear, and 40% were from socio-economic groups C2, D and E\u000a      (IMP3).\u000a    Drawing on the underpinning research insights has enabled museum staff to\u000a      deliver a number of\u000a      public lectures, which has resulted in loans to larger national and\u000a      international museums. For\u000a      example, statuette of Nike for a temporary exhibition on the Olympics at\u000a      the British Museum, July-September\u000a      2008; a pelike of the Pan Painter to the Onassis Cultural Center, New York\u000a      for an\u000a      exhibition on `Worshipping Women: Ritual and Reality in Classical Athens,\u000a      December 2008-May\u000a      2009 and the National Archaeology Museum, Athens, July-November 2009,\u000a      thereby increasing the\u000a      reach of the impact (IMP4). As part of Shefton memorial events in\u000a      April 2013, leading Classical\u000a      Archaeologists presented on key pieces of the Shefton collection. The\u000a      conference and public\u000a      lectures programme was free and open to the public, attracting around 500\u000a      people in total (IMP5).\u000a    Informing Education outside the HEI and Academy\u000a    Since it opened, more than 95,000 children have visited GNM with their\u000a      schools - these include\u000a      both taught workshops by TWAM staff as well as teacher-led visits (IMP3).\u000a      Bookings for visits are\u000a      buoyant as a result of the sustained and on-going commitment of the\u000a      University and museum staff\u000a      to provide resources for teachers. Whilst the Shefton collection was first\u000a      created to support\u000a      teaching and research within the HEI, it has since been developed as an\u000a      educational teaching\u000a      resource for school children, firstly by university staff through\u000a      education outreach at the Shefton\u000a      Museum, and more recently at the GNM. TWAM staff have been able to develop\u000a      innovative\u000a      educational experiences which connect, for example, ancient Greek myth and\u000a      religion to the\u000a      natural world as well as develop visual and story-telling skills in\u000a      school-age children (IMP6).\u000a      Workshops on topics covered in the National Curriculum (such as the\u000a      Olympics, ancient myth,\u000a      Greek warfare, and Greek art) are popular and growing, and the Greek\u000a      collection is particularly\u000a      popular in supporting teaching of Greek history in Key Stage 2. The\u000a      learning outcomes achieved\u000a      by these workshops are to increase students' knowledge about hoplites,\u000a      compare the ancient and\u000a      modern Olympics, and allow students to examine and in some cases handle\u000a      artefacts; they draw\u000a      directly on the research and collection (IMP6). Between April 2011\u000a      and July 2013 alone, more than\u000a      3000 school-age children have attended Greek workshops led by TWAM staff (IMP7).\u000a      Feedback\u000a      from teachers is positive: they comment that it supports their work in\u000a      class well, helping to\u000a      stimulate discussion and motivate their students whilst allowing them an\u000a      opportunity to view and\u000a      handle artefacts (IMP7). The Shefton collection is also popular\u000a      for teacher-led visits, where\u000a      teachers are encouraged to download worksheets so they can experience the\u000a      ancient Greek\u000a      material side-by-side with other collections (IMP6).\u000a    As part of the Shefton memorial events, the Shefton collection has also\u000a      been used to inspire and\u000a      support artistic expression in school-age children in a new project\u000a      between the University, GNM\u000a      and West Jesmond Primary School (IMP5). Sally Waite (Newcastle\u000a      University Teaching Fellow)\u000a      and Andrew Parkin (GNM Keeper of Archaeology) led the project which ran\u000a      from January to April\u000a      2013. Following an assembly and archaeological workshops in which each\u000a      class looked at objects\u000a      from the collection the children produced artworks with the help of\u000a      Newcastle University student\u000a      volunteers. Two art pieces per class were selected for an exhibition held\u000a      in the GNM during the\u000a      Shefton memorial week in April 2013 (with future redisplays already\u000a      planned). All year 3 students\u000a      (who are studying the Greeks) also spent a day at the GNM doing various\u000a      activities (pottery,\u000a      temple building, drama, mythic comic books and hoplite workshops). In\u000a      total, 572 children aged 4-11\u000a      and 24 teachers took part in the project. Feedback from both teachers and\u000a      children is largely\u000a      very positive. For example, the children found the project interesting and\u000a      fun and one said \"it was\u000a        good because you have fun while you were learning\". They also\u000a      enjoyed being able to see, handle\u000a      and feel the artefacts, using \"real things\" to design and make\u000a      their own art, often using new\u000a      techniques such as drawing on pottery rather than paper. Using objects\u000a      from the collection brought\u000a      an element to the children's learning not normally experienced in the\u000a      classroom. Feedback from\u000a      the teachers echoed these points, particularly the level of engagement,\u000a      enjoyment and enthusiasm\u000a      showed by the children who \"were able to do a real practical activity\u000a        which had more meaning for\u000a        them\". The teachers felt that the project, which one teacher called\u000a      \"hands on history\" supported\u000a      curriculum teaching as well as giving younger children an introduction to\u000a      a topic they would study\u000a      in future. One said that the project \"showed that even in Early Years\u000a        teaching we can introduce\u000a        elements of history\". Teachers also benefited as some felt that the\u000a      project gave them greater\u000a      knowledge and new ideas to try in the classroom, and highlighted the\u000a      importance of using new\u000a      stimuli in teaching, as well as the potential for cross-curriculum\u000a      teaching, i.e. making more use of\u000a      art when studying Greeks or the Romans (IMP8).\u000a    Another of the educational resources developed by TWAM is the Greek loans\u000a      boxes. These `boxes\u000a      of delight' are partly based on objects from the Shefton collection and\u000a      are very popular with\u000a      schools (at all stages), home educators and other groups. Between 2008 and\u000a      July 2013, more than\u000a      250 adults and 3800 children across 9 local education authorities (LEAs)\u000a      in the north east of\u000a      England accessed the loans boxes. They are often requested to aid teaching\u000a      of topics in the\u000a      National Curriculum, or to develop skills, such as literacy, drawing,\u000a      discovery and investigation.\u000a      Feedback is positive, with claims that the loan boxes were inspirational,\u000a      useful for generating\u000a      discussion and helpful in imagining the past and bringing lessons to life.\u000a      For example, one school\u000a      commented that the Greek loans boxes were \"a great resource enjoyed by\u000a        the children and a huge\u000a        asset to their learning and understanding\" (IMP9).\u000a    In addition to school groups, other universities within and outside the\u000a      region use the collection for\u000a      research and teaching purposes. Academic staff at other HEIs, for example\u000a      Edinburgh and\u000a      Durham Universities, have noted the value and prestige of the research\u000a      collection, and expressed\u000a      the positive benefits to students in their learning experiences. For\u000a      example, a Professor of Greek\u000a      Art and Archaeology from Edinburgh University brought Masters students to\u000a      visit the Shefton\u000a      collection, which she described as \"ideal for teaching\". According\u000a      to the Professor, the visiting\u000a      students said that the visit \"had been the highlight of the semester,\u000a        that they loved it, that it was\u000a        eye-opening to them, and set them on fire to learn more\", and she\u000a      went on to say that \"these\u000a        students gained tremendously from the experience\" and that she could\u000a      \"hardly think of a better\u000a        instance of impact\" (IMP10).\u000a    Online tools have also been developed by Newcastle scholars to inform\u000a      education outside the HEI\u000a      and the academy. Identifact, http:\/\/cias.ncl.ac.uk\/Identifact\/,\u000a      which was originally designed as a\u000a      revision tool for Newcastle University students, is now available globally\u000a      as an internet learning tool\u000a      for the study of Greek pottery.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at Newcastle has been instrumental in developing an\u000a      internationally recognised research\u000a      collection of ancient Greek and Etruscan artefacts.

By adding\u000a      meaning and context to the\u000a      artefacts, the research thus enabled museum staff to: i) deliver public\u000a      lectures on the research\u000a      collection thereby resulting in loans to national and international\u000a      museums; and ii) develop\u000a      educational resources and events (including worksheets, workshops and\u000a      object loan boxes) to\u000a      support innovative teaching in schools and universities.

The underpinning research in the\u000a      period 1993-2009 has\u000a      drawn upon the objects in the collection and has been instrumental in\u000a      developing it through\u000a      supporting the collection's cataloguing and interpretation in museum\u000a      displays, raising its profile and\u000a      justifying its inclusion in the GNM. The research, carried out by Brian\u000a      Shefton (Emeritus Professor,\u000a      1984-2012), produced key insights about ancient Greek and Etruscan\u000a      artefacts and the collection\u000a      is now acknowledged as the most important collection of archaeological\u000a      material from the Greek\u000a      world in the north of England and one of the best collections of Etruscan\u000a      material in the UK,\u000a      outside the British Museum. Strengths of the collection include an\u000a      extensive range of pottery, a\u000a      group of bronzes (including a fine collection of Greek and Etruscan\u000a      mirrors) and a range of\u000a      sculpture (e.g. Nike, colossal porphyry foot).\u000a    The underpinning research draws on key pieces from the collection, using\u000a      an extremely detailed\u000a      analysis to be able to situate the pieces in their wider context. New\u000a      research insights and findings\u000a      disseminated via many internationally renowned publications have raised\u000a      the profile and\u000a      significance of the artefacts as well as the collection as a whole (1-6).\u000a      The acquisition of the upper\u000a      part of a bronze oinochoe (wine jug) in the early 2000s was particularly\u000a      significant and inspired\u000a      new research and a re-examination of `Rhodian' oinochoai. Shefton\u000a      published the definitive work\u000a      on these in 1979, which was revisited and updated in his 2009 article.\u000a      Here the evidence for the\u000a      origins of this type of vessel are reassessed and research findings show\u000a      that they are in fact\u000a      Etruscan rather than Greek, as had previously been thought. This research\u000a      provides a key point of\u000a      reference in an important category of bronze vessel (1). Research\u000a      on the situla (bucket) from the\u000a      collection involved investigating the origin of the piece. Much\u000a      unpublished material is drawn\u000a      together to argue for an Aegean centre of manufacture, which is counter to\u000a      the generally accepted\u000a      belief that the situlae are South Italian (2). A relief decorated\u000a      situla in the collection was used to\u000a      review early representations of the female centaur in a wide ranging\u000a      discussion of the Malacena\u000a      fabric of early Hellenistic Volterra, and research insights noted the\u000a      reproduction of metal prototypes\u000a      and the influence of Greek reliefs, which is significant as it sheds light\u000a      on the relationship between\u000a      Greeks and Etruscans (3). The study of black-glaze castulo cups\u000a      from the collection produced\u000a      significant research insights concerning the unusual method of\u000a      construction, noting that they are\u000a      thick walled, heavy vessels in order to withstand long journeys (4).\u000a      The research also produced\u000a      insights into the chronology of these pieces.\u000a    The research is truly international, transcending borders in order to map\u000a      the trade routes by which\u000a      objects were transported in Antiquity. The research approach to the\u000a      material culture of the Greek\u000a      and Etruscan world was distinguished by Shefton's ability to make\u000a      connections between related\u000a      cultures and was informed by his extensive knowledge of museum collections\u000a      throughout Europe\u000a      and further afield.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24024","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research led to multiple, interrelated impacts which primarily affect\u000a      the making of civil society\u000a      and the influencing of public discourse. In addition, the research has\u000a      influenced economic\u000a      behaviour, within the tourist industry. These impacts have been achieved\u000a      through a variety of\u000a      means, especially in the form of public lectures, workshops and debates,\u000a      TV broadcasts, blog\u000a      communications, and travel tours. Some of the research outputs have\u000a      additionally been utilised in\u000a      the education of British students. The more specific means by which these\u000a      impacts have been\u000a      achieved, and the particulars of each impact (as well as the periods in\u000a      which these occurred) are\u000a      illustrated below in greater detail.\u000a    a) civil society and public discourse:\u000a    The research has underpinned the dissemination of knowledge and\u000a      understanding of ancient\u000a      Persia amongst the general public through public lectures and debates in a\u000a      variety of fora and on a\u000a      number of occasions. E.g. at the Edinburgh Iranian Festival (EIF) in 2011\u000a      and 2013, Llewellyn-\u000a      Jones was invited to give book readings of his recent work, including from\u000a      his Ctesias' History of\u000a        Persia, followed by Q&amp;A sessions, and of his King and Court\u000a      (see 5.1). The Edinburgh Iranian\u000a      Festival is a non-political `space' for exchange on Iran's culture and\u000a      history. The Festival aims `to\u000a      introduce the tremendous breadth of Iranian history and culture to adults\u000a      and children in Scotland,\u000a      and to integrate the two communities [Scottish and Iranian] through a\u000a      broad range of interactive\u000a      events spanning numerous art-forms' (mission statement EIF: http:\/\/www.ediranfest.co.uk\/\u000a      [http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/p8qqvc4]).\u000a      The second invitation issued to Llewellyn-Jones to speak at the 2013\u000a      event, as well as the questionnaires from the public lectures, debates,\u000a      and workshops from that\u000a      event, document vividly the impact especially on the Iranian community\u000a        in Edinburgh and other\u000a      members of the local, British public of Llewellyn-Jones' research\u000a      on Iran's ancient past: 100%\u000a      (= 63) of the returned questionnaires from the 2013 events (i.e. two\u000a      public lectures that attracted\u000a      over 200 individuals, and a workshop, all held in February 2013) show that\u000a      the participants gained\u000a      new knowledge and an enriched understanding of Iran's ancient past. The\u000a      participants emphasised\u000a      especially how the events raised their awareness of `cultural differences'\u000a      in general and of `the\u000a      interface between Ancient Greece and contemporary Persia' in particular.\u000a      In addition, Llewellyn-Jones'\u000a      focus on the relationship between (ancient) history and (modern) society\u000a      has advanced\u000a      more generally the target audience's awareness of the role of historical\u000a      writing in the making of\u000a      modern civil society. As one participant put it in their lecture\u000a      questionnaire: `the lecture [...] gave\u000a      me an insight into a different culture and time, whilst raising issues of\u000a      relevance to current political\u000a      and social arenas. It was the highlight of the festival, giving historical\u000a      depth to the event'. Another\u000a      stated that Llewellyn-Jones' lecturing `has vastly increased my knowledge\u000a      of Ancient Persia and\u000a      my desire to know more'; whilst a participant who had first-hand\u000a      experience of modern Iran `found\u000a      (themselves) constantly reflecting on (their) modern day experience with\u000a      the land 1977-78 and this\u000a      part of its history, evolution and myth'. (See 5.2 for all quotations.)\u000a      Two of the events at the 2013\u000a      EIF were hosted by the School of History, Classics and Archaeology on\u000a      University premises to\u000a      enhance the opportunity for exchange between the local Iranian community\u000a      and the academic\u000a      community at the University as well as with members of the British public\u000a      in general (see also\u000a      REF3a).\u000a    Llewellyn-Jones's research has also had an impact outwith Britain, most\u000a      notably amongst the\u000a      Farsi-speaking community within Iran itself. This is best exemplified by\u000a      the filming of Llewellyn-Jones'\u000a      2011 events at the EIF through the Iranian TV company KahkeshanTV: the\u000a      lectures were\u000a      subsequently dubbed into Farsi to enhance their reception amongst the\u000a        non-English speaking\u000a        Iranian public, and made available for public viewing via YouTube,\u000a      with 439 hits by 31 July 2013\u000a      (see 5.3). Following the 2013 events, the Iranian TV company Manoto TV\u000a      broadcast an interview\u000a      with Llewellyn-Jones on Iranian television. After the broadcast, one\u000a      viewer commented on 4 March\u000a      2013 that `many other Iranians have found your work and blog very\u000a      interesting like I do':\u000a      http:\/\/persianthings.wordpress.com\/related-links\/\u000a      The interview, as well as the lectures from the\u000a      2013 EIF, have been made available on Persian Things,\u000a      Llewellyn-Jones' blog, which was\u000a      launched in January 2013 to encourage public debate by a larger audience.\u000a      Together with the\u000a      original broadcasts, the internet viewings, and regular discussion pieces\u000a      that are informed by\u000a      Llewellyn-Jones' research into Persia, the blog has led to lively exchange\u000a      on ancient Persia:\u000a      http:\/\/persianthings.wordpress.com\/\u000a      [http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/q3g6x3e]. Bloggers\u000a        from Britain, Iran, and\u000a        other countries have made contributions to the blog communications.\u000a      Their comments document\u000a      the transformation of popular knowledge and the enrichment of\u000a      cross-community exchange\u000a      stimulated by Llewellyn-Jones' work and activity. As one `visiting'\u000a      blogger wrote: `Just bumped into\u000a      your fantastic blog, I will use a bit of it to teach my ancient historians\u000a      &#8212; must buy the book now [...]'\u000a      The impact of Llewellyn-Jones' research is also demonstrated in video\u000a      footage that combines\u000a      information from the public lectures and outreach events, and is directly\u000a      accessible through the\u000a      blog: http:\/\/persianthings.wordpress.com\/video\/.\u000a    A different venue through which Llewellyn-Jones's research has made an\u000a      impact on members of\u000a        the British public was a London-based summer school, in July 2013\u000a      (continued into August), on\u000a      ancient Persia. The summer school allowed Llewellyn-Jones to disseminate\u000a      his research to the\u000a      public via direct teaching (see 5.4). The 27 questionnaires document that\u000a      the participants all learnt\u000a      something new from Llewellyn-Jones' teaching. In particular, the\u000a      participants' comments\u000a      demonstrate how their knowledge was changed through\u000a      Llewellyn-Jones' work: one stated that `in\u000a      King and Court [...] I appreciated the way I could connect history\u000a      with documents', another that\u000a      they `now feel better able to put the Persian Empire within the context of\u000a      ancient history' (see 5.5\u000a      for all quotations).\u000a    In addition to cross-community exchange in Britain, the research has also\u000a      underpinned the direct\u000a      contact with Iran's ancient past (and the country's modern inhabitants) by\u000a      members of the British\u000a        public in Iran. This has been achieved through the means of travel\u000a      tours to the ancient Persian\u000a      sites, organised by international tour companies. Since 2008,\u000a      Llewellyn-Jones has guided five\u000a      tours to Iran with over 100 participants. He has acted as the sole\u000a      academic tour leader on these\u000a      tours. His research has directly informed the tour programme: it has been\u000a      incorporated in the\u000a      formal tour schedule through discussion sessions and lectures. In this\u000a      way, Llewellyn-Jones'\u000a      research has influenced the associations of the tour participants with\u000a      Iran and its ancient past, and\u000a      has furthered their cultural enrichment gained from such contacts. It has\u000a      also enhanced the\u000a      stimulus derived from such culture contacts for the development of an open\u000a      and receptive attitude\u000a      towards further exchange and engagement with an Eastern country: as one\u000a      participant put it, `The\u000a      choice of itinerary was first class and the reason we booked this tour'\u000a      (see 5.6).\u000a    b) economic prosperity:\u000a    The financial income derived from the travel tours described in 4a above\u000a      is significant. The income\u000a      benefits directly the travel tour providers. These are private\u000a      companies set up for profit: the tours\u000a      are a distinct feature of their business enterprise and (financial)\u000a      success. The delivery and part of\u000a      the programme content is directly dependent on the availability and\u000a      expertise of the tour leader,\u000a      including, as stated above, lectures and discussion sessions that\u000a      disseminate Llewellyn-Jones'\u000a      research findings to the tour participants. Since 2008, Llewellyn-Jones\u000a      has led five tours for three\u000a      different companies, with over 100 guests. The gross income of these tours\u000a      was in excess of\u000a      &#163;250K. Incomes for individual tours range between &#163;15,000 for a tour of\u000a      Persian antiquities in\u000a      Europe to between &#163;32,000-73,600 for tours of ancient sites in Iran (see\u000a      5.6). Llewellyn-Jones'\u000a      research thus assists in the creation of wealth through informing the tour\u000a      programme and lecture\u000a      schedule of travel tours offered by the tourist industry.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Persian Past-Iranian Present is a programme of research into\u000a      cultural perceptions of Iran's ancient\u000a      past, in particular, Achaemenid Persia.

The\u000a      programme of research began in\u000a      2004 and is ongoing.\u000a    The research is concentrated on improving understanding of the\u000a        society and culture of\u000a        Achaemenid Persia, with particular attention to aspects of court\u000a      society, dress and the body in\u000a      Persia. The interactions between East and West as reflected in these areas\u000a      of research &#8212; i.e.\u000a      between `the Greeks' and `the Persians' - are the central focus of\u000a      Llewellyn-Jones' work. The work\u000a      is carried out in a number of specialised research areas. The relationship\u000a      of Greek and Persian\u000a      iconographic models, and their interaction with a localised form of\u000a      representation, is studied in the\u000a      work on seal imagery created in Achaemenid Anatolia. The contact and\u000a      exchange of ideas and\u000a      forms between the ancient East and West as well as within sub-groups of\u000a      ancient Persian culture\u000a      (e.g. Iranian plateau peoples) is analysed in work on the history and\u000a      structure of pre-Islamic Iranian\u000a      dress. And the question of Eastern and Western representations of\u000a      monarchy, government, and\u000a      gender is explored in work on the Persian court.\u000a    The research was published in a number of articles and contributions to\u000a      edited volumes (see 3a\u000a      below). It culminated in two larger studies: (with J. Robson) Ctesias'\u000a        History of Persia. Tales from\u000a        the Orient (London: Routledge, 2010; translated into Farsi, 2011)\u000a      and King and Court in Ancient\u000a        Persia, 559-331 BC (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2013).\u000a      Both studies are also used as\u000a      textbooks.\u000a    Llewellyn-Jones' research has contributed to a more nuanced understanding\u000a      of the social\u000a      interaction and the points of cultural contact between East and West in\u000a      antiquity. His work has\u000a      made available, for the first time, to both English-language and\u000a      Farsi-language readerships, all of\u000a      the surviving text and fragments of Ctesias' Persica, in\u000a      combination with an extensive historical\u000a      introduction that explores Ctesias' attempt at conveying to a Greek\u000a      audience a bona fide Persian\u000a      account of their own past. Llewellyn-Jones's work has shown that Ctesias\u000a      did not invent the\u000a      `Orient' as a negative construct, but, rather, that the Greek Ctesias\u000a      observed, asked questions,\u000a      listened, and recorded a mixture of authentic Persian stories during his\u000a      time at the royal court in\u000a      Persia as the Persian king's physician, which formed the basis for his\u000a      later writings. Contrary to\u000a      being poor historical evidence, Llewellyn-Jones has shown that Ctesias' Persica\u000a      is an important\u000a      source for the study of ancient Persia that affords insights into Persian\u000a      society and politics that are\u000a      not otherwise available, with particular regard to the workings of the\u000a      Persian court, and the political\u000a      manoeuvrings inside the royal family. In arguing against the scholarly\u000a      practice of tarnishing all\u000a      Greeks, including Ctesias, as Orientalists (in the Saidian sense),\u000a      Llewellyn-Jones' research has\u000a      thus encouraged the continued debate on ancient and modern perceptions of\u000a      the societies and\u000a      cultures of East and West.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24025","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    HNItaly has been used by scholars of ancient numismatics and the history\u000a      of the ancient, classical\u000a      world across the globe. But it has also offered a means of bringing the\u000a      research to a wider\u000a      audience, thereby achieving multiple impacts in relation to wealth\u000a      creation, public service and\u000a      public discourse. The impacts are at times overlapping, especially\u000a      concerning public discourse and\u000a      public service. The impacts all occurred (and continue to occur) both in\u000a      the UK and internationally,\u000a      as specified below.\u000a    a) wealth creation:\u000a    HNItaly provides coin dealers world-wide with a means to identify\u000a      their goods (i.e. coins from\u000a      ancient, pre-Roman Italy). It is a necessary tool for their professional\u000a      activities, providing the\u000a      required know-how for marketing, advertising, and, eventually, pricing\u000a      their goods: it is the single\u000a      most important tool in this process concerning the Greek coinages of\u000a      ancient Italy, as evidenced in\u000a      coin sale catalogues world-wide. A good example is the catalogue for\u000a      Greek, Roman and\u000a      Byzantine coins auctioned in May 2013 (`Auction 72') by Numismatica Ars\u000a      Classica NAC AG:\u000a      whilst other identification tools were used with regard to individual\u000a      coins, HNItaly was used\u000a      consistently for all of the Greek coins from Italy that were offered for\u000a      auction (`Greek coins' (Italy),\u000a      nos. 282-296, pp. 3-13): http:\/\/www.arsclassicacoins.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/NAC-72-OK_1-64s.pdf\u000a      [http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/oh6kxan]\u000a      Typical examples for the identification of coins according\u000a      to HNItaly include a stater from Taras, auctioned by Numismatica Ars\u000a      Classica AG (`Auction 72',\u000a      16-17 May 2013: i below), or a 25-as gold Etruscan coin, auctioned\u000a      by Sincona Coin Auction AG\u000a      Z&#252;rich (`Antike Auktion 10', 27 May 2013: ii below):\u000a    (i) Stater circa 302-300, AV 8.61 g.

The impact\u000a      occurred between January 2008 and July 2013 (and is ongoing). The\u000a      locations of sale houses that\u000a      employ HNItaly in the UK and oversees document its national and\u000a      international reach: e.g. A.

It is a necessary tool in the `apprenticeship' of current and future\u000a      Keepers of Coins in\u000a      institutions that hold a Greek coin collection, both in the UK and abroad\u000a      (see 5.6). Moreover,\u000a      the knowledge and expertise provided through HNItaly allows the correct\u000a      identification of their\u000a      holdings. HNItaly thus also facilitates further study and public display,\u000a      which affords in particular\u000a      visitors to institutions that hold a Greek coin collection an opportunity\u000a      to appreciate the cultural\u000a      heritage of ancient Italy.\u000a    The significance of HNItaly in the training of numismatists in a museum\u000a      context is mirrored by\u000a      its importance in the training of numismatists in the academic sector:\u000a      the volume has provided\u000a      the primary reference work throughout academia internationally for the\u000a      training of numismatists\u000a      in the study of the Greek coinages of ancient Italy. This is especially\u000a      the case in Italy where the\u000a      subject is taught more than anywhere else, but applies generally wherever\u000a      numismatics is an\u000a      academic subject. HNItaly also benefits the Italian Archaeological\u000a        Service in its identification\u000a      of coins from archaeological contexts, especially in the south of Italy\u000a      (see 5.7).\u000a      In sum, HNItaly has become the single most important textbook in this\u000a      sub-field of ancient\u000a      numismatics, and is an indispensable training tool in academic settings,\u000a      in museum contexts,\u000a      and in archaeological service sectors. The impact is within and across\u000a      numerous countries, as\u000a      evidenced by the locations of the institutions and services that use\u000a      HNItaly, including such\u000a      diverse institutions as the British Museum in London, and the\u000a      Soprintendenza Salerno-Avellino\u000a      (see 5.6 and 5.7). The impact occurred throughout the period 2008-2013.\u000a    (ii) HNItaly has provided the primary reference work for the US\u000a        Border Patrol in its effort at\u000a      law enforcement concerning the import of ancient coinages into the USA. On\u000a      19 January 2011,\u000a      HNItaly has been publicly named in the US Federal Register amongst the\u000a      means of\u000a      identification for coins potentially subject to illegal import into the\u000a      USA. This was in response to\u000a      a Diplomatic Note from the Government of Italy requesting the Designated\u000a      List of\u000a      archaeological material originating in Italy and representing the\u000a      Pre-Classical, Classical, and\u000a      Imperial Roman Periods, to be amended so that `import restrictions are\u000a      also being imposed on\u000a      a new subcategory of objects (coins)'; as a result, `the category entitled\u000a      ``Metal'' has been\u000a      amended to include the subcategory ``Coins of Italian Types.'''

Price, Coins\u000a      and Medals, British Museum; Prof. M.H. Crawford, History, UCL; Dr A.\u000a      Johnston, independent\u000a      scholar). Rutter was the largest single contributor to the content of the\u000a      main research output,\u000a      Historia Numorum. Italy, and the principal editor of all the\u000a      contributions to the volume. Rutter retired\u000a      from UoE in 2004.\u000a    The research has put our understanding of numismatics in ancient\u000a        Italy on a new footing. The\u000a      research involved not only a critical analysis of all the relevant\u000a      literature, but also the detailed study\u000a      of the coins themselves in great national collections (such as those of\u000a      the British Museum in\u000a      London, the Cabinet des M&#233;dailles in the Biblioth&#232;que Nationale in Paris,\u000a      and the Museo\u000a      Archeologico Nazionale in Naples), or small local collections rich in the\u000a      material of a single mint.\u000a      This work involved personal research especially in the UK, Italy, other\u000a      European countries, and the\u000a      USA.\u000a    The findings were published in various articles in edited specialist\u000a      volumes, internationally\u000a      recognised journals, and in a monograph (see 3a below): it culminated in Historia\u000a        Numorum. Italy\u000a      (London: British Museum Press, 2001).\u000a    HNItaly is a handbook providing a clear account (with up-to-date,\u000a      often revised identifications) of\u000a      the Greek and other local coinages of peninsular Italy. Most of the\u000a      coinages treated belong\u000a      between the archaic period and the Second Punic War, but a few mints\u000a      continued an independent\u000a      existence down to the late Republic or even the early Empire. The overall\u000a      arrangement is\u000a      geographical, making it possible to understand the non-Roman coinages of\u000a      Italy at the level of a\u000a      single community, a region, or Italy as a whole. Some 180 pages of\u000a      catalogue are accompanied by\u000a      over 40 plates. The catalogue draws on all the available material, whether\u000a      in public or private\u000a      collections or in the reports of archaeological excavations or in sale\u000a      catalogues. This is the first\u000a      time that the coinage of any area of the Greek world of comparable size\u000a      has been catalogued so\u000a      fully and provided with such a rich illustrative apparatus, and one of the\u000a      particular strengths of the\u000a      volume is its rigorous handling of the often thorny problems of chronology\u000a      and attribution.\u000a    One of the distinctive features of the coinage of ancient Italy is the\u000a      spread of coinage from the\u000a      Greek world not only to Rome but also to numerous other non-Greek\u000a      communities (e.g. Aquilonia\u000a      in Samnium, Capua in Campania, Iguvium in Umbria, and Luceria in Apulia).\u000a      Our understanding of\u000a      the underlying process of cultural contact (including exchange especially\u000a      on a social, economic,\u000a      political and religious level), documented through the spread of coinage,\u000a      has been greatly\u000a      enhanced through Rutter's work. A specific example is the very different\u000a      cultural and linguistic\u000a      histories of, for instance, Campania and Apulia, which now stand out in\u000a      sharp relief as a result of\u000a      our changed understanding of their coinages through the research here\u000a      described.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24026","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research was disseminated through a variety of means, notably in the\u000d\u000a      form of public lectures and debates, including media broadcasts. Key\u000d\u000a      archaeological discoveries were made available to public services,\u000d\u000a      including museums and local councils. These forms of dissemination\u000d\u000a      generated a range of interrelated impacts, primarily in the areas of the\u000d\u000a      making of civil society and the influencing of public discourse about\u000d\u000a      contentious contemporary questions such as imperial expansion and rule,\u000d\u000a      military occupation, citizenship status, immigration and integration. The\u000d\u000a      particulars of each impact (as well as the periods in which these\u000d\u000a      occurred) are illustrated below.\u000d\u000a    a) civil society:\u000d\u000a    The tombstone of Lucius Valerius, a veteran of the Second Augustan\u000d\u000a      Legion, has provided Oxfordshire Council with a means to enhance\u000d\u000a      citizenship ceremonies. At the request of Oxford Register Office, Sauer\u000d\u000a      provided information and a picture of the tombstone after its discovery.\u000d\u000a      The veteran, who came from northern Italy, retired in conquered territory.\u000d\u000a      When the tombstone went on display (see b below), BBC News Oxford\u000d\u000a      announced Lucius as `Oxfordshire's earliest recorded resident': http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-oxfordshire-22873707\u000d\u000a      [http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/lrodxql]. The\u000d\u000a      tombstone of Lucius Valerius documents in effect the earliest known immigrant\u000d\u000a      to the area of the modern county of Oxfordshire. The research findings\u000d\u000a      have subsequently been used to illustrate aspects of immigration and\u000d\u000a      integration in citizenship ceremonies in Oxfordshire: the findings now\u000d\u000a      feature in the materials given to thousands of individuals recently\u000d\u000a        granted British citizenship, thus impacting on their reflection on\u000d\u000a      British civic status in particular and the making of civil society in\u000d\u000a      general. Oxford Register Office commented that `we [the Council] thought\u000d\u000a      that readers would be impressed by the fact that Lucius Valerius was a new\u000d\u000a      arrival to the area nearly 2,000 years ago'. More specifically, the\u000d\u000a      superintendent registrar of the Oxford Register Office stated in e-mail\u000d\u000a      correspondence on 8 December 2011 that the materials provided by Sauer\u000d\u000a      feature in a book `which has been specially written for new citizens' and\u000d\u000a      `is presented to new citizens who are becoming British at their\u000d\u000a      citizenship ceremony': the `combination of tradition and diversity [...]',\u000d\u000a      the Register Office commented, `provides an eloquent testament to the\u000d\u000a      arrival and experience of people settling and becoming British in\u000d\u000a      Oxfordshire'. The Register Office confirmed that they have `received many\u000d\u000a      positive comments about the book from our new citizens'.\u000d\u000a    The quantitative impact is documented by the number of citizenship\u000d\u000a      ceremonies: the superintendent registrar stated that `citizenship\u000d\u000a      ceremonies are held every week in Oxfordshire and on average about 150\u000d\u000a      people per month become British in our county [...]' Over the period in\u000d\u000a      which the materials have been used (from 2009 onwards), the average annual\u000d\u000a      total was 1,800, i.e. around 7,000 individuals between 2009 and July 2013\u000d\u000a      in total: at the time of correspondence (in 2011), the superintendent\u000d\u000a      registrar confirmed that `the photo will have been seen by about 3,500-\u000d\u000a      4,000 citizens' (see 5.1 for all quotations). The discovery of the\u000d\u000a      tombstone of the veteran of the Second Augustan Legion by Sauer and his\u000d\u000a      team, providing the only known biography of a person living in the area of\u000d\u000a      modern Oxfordshire prior to the Middle Ages, has thus had a direct impact\u000d\u000a      on issues surrounding immigration, integration, and civic status in\u000d\u000a      modern-day Britain.\u000d\u000a    b) public discourse:\u000d\u000a    The key research findings of Sauer's archaeological investigation of the\u000d\u000a      legionary fortress at Alchester led to a travelling exhibition in\u000d\u000a      Oxfordshire in 2011. The County Museum Stores at Standlake displayed some\u000d\u000a      of the key artefacts from Alchester, including a section of the original\u000d\u000a      main wooden gatepost that formed part of the early fort defences in AD 44,\u000d\u000a      and the tombstone of the veteran (see 5.2). `History exhibition attracts\u000d\u000a      hundreds' was the headline of the local newspaper (see 5.3). The\u000d\u000a      exhibition drew on the enduring fascination of the British public with the\u000d\u000a      Romans in Britain. As a consequence of the public interest in the\u000d\u000a      temporary exhibition, a permanent exhibition has been mounted in Woodstock\u000d\u000a      at the Oxfordshire Museum, which is open to the public since 20 July 2013\u000d\u000a      (see also REF3a). The discussion generated by the finds amongst the\u000d\u000a      British (local) public is well documented in a popular newspaper article\u000d\u000a      on the establishment of the permanent display (Bicester Advertiser; 25\u000d\u000a      November 2010, p. 13 [http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/onaqxa7]).\u000aAs\u000a      the success of the travelling exhibition makes clear, the display of the\u000d\u000a      artefacts in a museum context fostered an engagement with Britain's early\u000d\u000a      history especially amongst the local population in Oxfordshire,\u000d\u000a      and with particular regard to the Roman military occupation of the island,\u000d\u000a      as well as the impact of imperial expansion and rule on Britannia.\u000d\u000a    Public lectures by Sauer to local archaeology societies in Britain\u000d\u000a      have further influenced how members of the British public view\u000d\u000a      their own exposure to historical `borderlines'. Most notably, after\u000d\u000a      Sauer's talk to the Falkirk Archaeological and Natural History Society in\u000d\u000a      December 2012 on the Gorgan and (neighbouring) Tammishe Walls, the\u000d\u000a      Society's Honorary Secretary wrote to Sauer commenting that `living, as we\u000d\u000a      do, in the shadow of the Antonine Wall it was good to see the role of an\u000d\u000a      even larger frontier wall in its empire's history'. Sauer's research was\u000d\u000a      described as `illuminating', and the Honorary Secretary commented further\u000d\u000a      that the Society's members learnt that `climate change and sea level\u000d\u000a      changing are not a modern phenomenon'. The lasting impact on the knowledge\u000d\u000a      of other historical frontier zones by members of the British public is\u000d\u000a      also documented through the Honorary Secretary's statement that Sauer\u000d\u000a      delivered an `insight into a neglected region of the Middle East which, as\u000d\u000a      many said on the night, is an area [where] none of us has any real\u000d\u000a      knowledge. We can no longer say that' (see 5.4 for all quotations). The\u000d\u000a      findings from both the Roman fortress at Alchester and the Great Wall of\u000d\u000a      Gorgan were also central to a public debate hosted by the Royal\u000d\u000a        Archaeological Institute in London on 13 February 2013 titled `The\u000d\u000a      limits of imperial power: the function of military frontier walls'. The\u000d\u000a      entire debate (with David Breeze, an Honorary Professorial Fellow in\u000d\u000a      Classics at Edinburgh) was subsequently made available for public viewing\u000d\u000a      on the website of the Royal Archaeological Institute to encourage further\u000d\u000a      discussion: http:\/\/www.royalarchinst.org\/lectures\u000d\u000a      [http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/nsz3ym5]. The\u000d\u000a      media broadcast was highly successful. An official from the Institute\u000d\u000a      commented on 25 February 2013 that `it was a good idea and beneficial to\u000d\u000a      put the debate on the web for free', and that the number of hits within\u000d\u000a      the first 24 hours (`we've had 67 people view this information') `doesn't\u000d\u000a      sound much but it is for us' (see 5.5).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Sauer and collaborators on the relationship between large\u000d\u000a      imperial powers (`superpowers') and subject populations at the borders of\u000d\u000a      empire has influenced public debate in Britain.

Both in Britain (Alchester) and Iran (Gorgan\u000d\u000a      Wall), Sauer was one of the primary investigators as well as one of the\u000d\u000a      main contributors to the published research findings. Sauer has been\u000d\u000a      involved with the Alchester project continuously between 2003 and 2013.\u000d\u000a      Sauer has taken a lead role in the Gorgan Wall project in Iran since 2005.\u000d\u000a      He continues to be involved in both projects.\u000d\u000a    Sauer's work on the relationship between large imperial powers and\u000d\u000a        subject populations at the borders of empire has made a significant\u000d\u000a      contribution to our understanding of the nature of that relationship and\u000d\u000a      the purpose of the military structures on the imperial `borderlines'. His\u000d\u000a      fieldwork, subsequent research and publication of the site at Alchester\u000d\u000a      and The Great Wall of Gorgan have revealed hitherto unknown aspects of the\u000d\u000a      social, cultural, economic, and political interactions on and across the\u000d\u000a      borders. One of the key research findings is the recognition that the\u000d\u000a      control of the borders, their hinterlands, and their economic assets\u000d\u000a      required greater logistical efforts than previously recognised. Sauer has\u000d\u000a      argued forcefully for the importance of the military function of these\u000d\u000a      structures: despite socio-economic exchange between conquering soldiers\u000d\u000a      and local populations that documents much peaceful interaction and\u000d\u000a      transfer of goods, technologies, customs, and ideas, the wall structure\u000d\u000a      demonstrates that the attention of the imperial powers was firmly on the\u000d\u000a      defence of their empires. Consequently, the primary purpose of the\u000d\u000a      military sites is to be seen in the defence of empire, rather than, as\u000d\u000a      often suggested, as facilitators for economic exploitation of (newly)\u000d\u000a      conquered territories.\u000d\u000a    These general conclusions are based on specific research findings in a\u000d\u000a      number of areas. In the case of Alchester, Sauer was able to redate the\u000d\u000a      site to the immediate aftermath of the Roman invasion of Britain in AD\u000d\u000a      43\/45. The site, not previously identified as a fortress, has yielded the\u000d\u000a      earliest tree-ring dates from Roman Britain (AD 44\/45) and the earliest\u000d\u000a      representatives of newly introduced plant species. It is now generally\u000d\u000a      recognised as one of the most significant sites illuminating the period of\u000d\u000a      the Roman conquest. It also serves as the key case study for\u000d\u000a      dendrochronology in one of the most widely read introductions to\u000d\u000a      Archaeology (K. Greene, Archaeology: An Introduction (5th\u000d\u000a      rev. edition, 2010: 165). The excavated tombstone of a veteran of Legio II\u000d\u000a      Augusta provides moreover the first known pre-medieval biography of a\u000d\u000a      person living and dying in Oxfordshire. The veteran was of northern\u000d\u000a      Italian origin; his choice to retire in conquered territory suggests\u000d\u000a      personal interaction between (former) soldiers and the local population\u000d\u000a      which was not hindered by the fortress' role in the defence of Rome's\u000d\u000a      (newly conquered) territory.\u000d\u000a    On the basis of radiocarbon and OSL samples from burned charcoal, Sauer\u000d\u000a      redated the Great Wall of Gorgan to the 5th or 6th\u000d\u000a      century AD (from the previously favoured 2nd (or 1st)\u000d\u000a      century BC date): the wall is now associated with the empire of the\u000d\u000a      Sasanian Persians. Sauer has shown that the Wall and its hinterland\u000d\u000a      fortresses served to protect key economic assets in the northern frontier\u000d\u000a      zone of the vast Sasanian empire, where several major wars against the\u000d\u000a      White Huns and Turks are recorded. Wall construction was accompanied by a\u000d\u000a      massive landscape engineering project: the Sasanians constructed new water\u000d\u000a      supply canals, cutting through the pre-existing Iron Age landscape like a\u000d\u000a      knife. Excavation of the fort structures along the Wall revealed plentiful\u000d\u000a      evidence for dense occupation, including animal bones, pottery, glass and\u000d\u000a      metal: the Wall and its forts bustled with life, raising many questions\u000d\u000a      about the interaction between occupiers and locals.\u000d\u000a    The research was published in a variety of outlets (see 3a below). The\u000d\u000a      Great Wall of Gorgan- project culminated in a multi-authored book (Persia's\u000d\u000a        Imperial Power); the research findings from the excavations at\u000d\u000a      Alchester have been disseminated through articles, chapters, and\u000d\u000a      excavation reports, to be completed through the publication of the final\u000d\u000a      excavation report in 2015.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24407","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The National Theatre of Scotland's (NTS) production of Euripides' Bacchae\u000a      opened the 2007 Edinburgh International Festival, playing to 13,553\u000a      people. In 2008, the production transferred to London and to New York's\u000a      Lincoln Centre, subsequently returning to Scotland with a touring\u000a      production. The production was a critical and popular success for the NTS,\u000a      selling out even before its first Edinburgh performance. The production\u000a      had substantial national and international exposure, reaching audiences of\u000a      33,529 in the UK and 9,338 in New York, where it opened the Lincoln Centre\u000a      Festival with a nine-day run at the Rose Theatre (2-11 July 2008).\u000a    Ruffell was commissioned by NTS to produce a literal translation from the\u000a      Greek with commentary to allow the playwright, David Greig, to create a\u000a      version that would be readily understood by modern audiences without\u000a      departing radically from the meaning of the play. Existing translations\u000a      tended towards a very formal style of English, whereas the producers\u000a      wanted to create a modern version which would be accessible to a general\u000a      audience, rather than an `archaeological' relic of an ancient drama.\u000a      Playwright David Greig commented:\u000a    I was very keen to understand what an Athenian audience might have\u000a        been expected to experience when they watched this play. And Ian was so\u000a        knowledgeable about all of that. It was as close as I could get to\u000a        having Euripides available to me at the end of a phone.\u000a    Ruffell's research looks at the power of comedy in the play and the\u000a      impact this would have had on ancient audiences, and his ongoing role as\u000a      academic advisor on the script and at rehearsals enabled the scriptwriter\u000a      to strip back the formality and bring the comedy into focus without losing\u000a      the meaning of the lines. His aim was to keep the flavour of the play's\u000a      word order and line structure, which can be difficult to acquire from an\u000a      off-the-shelf translation.\u000a    The critical reception demonstrates both audience appreciation of the\u000a      powerful humour of the script and the acting, and a sense as a critic that\u000a      comedy, gender and self-reflexivity were utterly unexpected in a Greek\u000a      play, with the New York Times, for instance, calling it \"playfully\u000a      irreverent\". Many reviewers commented on a perceived imbalance between the\u000a      comedic and the tragic, but Ruffell argued that this was due to their\u000a      preconceptions of the play. As he explained in a 2010 interview with the\u000a      Open University, the comedy, violence and the gender play were not modern\u000a      additions, but were present in the original text, obscured by the serious,\u000a      tragedic production style of most performances. These same critics,\u000a      however, overwhelmingly give positive reviews; it was described as\u000a      \"lively, funny and rich in invention, the production keeps you entertained\u000a      almost to the end\" by the New York Times.\u000a    For playwright David Greig, Ruffell's contribution was instrumental to\u000a      being able to craft the play because:\u000a    ...the translation attended so plainly and in such detail to the\u000a        meaning of the text that I felt as fully aware as I could be of the\u000a        play's ambiguities, cultural contexts and ironies. Reading a section\u000a        with [Ian Ruffell's] notes and references I felt as though I knew the\u000a        play nearly as well as if I were reading the original Greek. I was very\u000a        keen to understand what an Athenian audience might have been expected to\u000a        experience when they watched this play.\u000a    The contribution of professional classicists in advising theatrical\u000a      productions has been investigated in a number of studies (outwith the\u000a      University of Glasgow) in the field of reception of ancient drama, in\u000a      which the example of the NTS Bacchae has figured strongly. In The\u000a        Public Value of the Humanities, Mary Beard cites Ruffell's work with\u000a      The Bacchae as an example of academic-theatre collaboration and\u000a      notes that it takes years to begin to thoroughly understand a Greek play\u000a      due to their cultural density, \"deeply embedded in the society, politics,\u000a      myth and religion of the ancient Greeks\", hence the need for an advisor.\u000a      She goes on:\u000a    The National Theatre of Scotland's Bacchae similarly exploited new\u000a        academic approaches to the play... the result challenged the old\u000a        familiar play about madness and possession, to suggest a story of the\u000a        collapse of identities, especially sexual ones &#8212; in an extraordinarily\u000a        powerful, disconcertingly modern, as well as authentically ancient,\u000a        production.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Ian Ruffell significantly contributed to the critically acclaimed\u000a      production of Euripides' Bacchae by the National Theatre of\u000a      Scotland (NTS), which toured London, New York and Scotland in 2008.\u000a      Ruffell re-translated the work and acted as academic advisor on the script\u000a      and production, helping to create an accessible, modern yet rigorously\u000a      accurate interpretation, which moved away from traditional performances of\u000a      Greek tragedy to draw out the humour, gender and self-reflexivity in The\u000a        Bacchae.

This provided the skills and experience of\u000a      translation and exegesis on which Ruffell's new, literal translation of\u000a      the Bacchae drew. This new text then underpinned playwright David\u000a      Greig's adaptation and informed director John Tiffany's NTS production.\u000a      More specifically Ruffell's research included a focus on the following\u000a      themes, which informed his interaction with adapter, director and cast: a)\u000a      self-conscious theatricality in the drama of the period, particularly\u000a      comedy; b) assessment of the nature and function of humour in drama; c)\u000a      construction and exploitation of gender in comedy and tragedy; and, d)\u000a      comparison between the nature of comedy and tragedy.\u000a    The main strand of Ruffell's research at Glasgow has been his work into\u000a      Greek comedy with a key output being his book Politics and\u000a        Anti-Realism in Athenian Old Comedy: the Art of the Impossible\u000a      (Oxford, 2011), supported by an award from the Arts &amp; Humanities\u000a      Research Council research leave scheme (2004\/5). This work was directly\u000a      pertinent to The Bacchae as it is in that play that Euripides most\u000a      clearly adopts techniques from comedy. Ruffell's understanding of the text - specifically\u000a\u0009  the comparison of comedy that he explores in respect of\u000a      theatricality, nature and function of humour and gender representation is\u000a      a feature of that research &#8212; and a main feature of both his book study and\u000a      his essay, `Audience and Emotion in the Reception of Greek Drama'.\u000a      Since joining the University of Glasgow, Ruffell has considered these\u000a      questions more directly in relation to tragedy, which has culminated in\u000a      his publication of Aeschylus: Prometheus Bound (2012), as well as\u000a      a series of papers on various aspects of Greek tragedy, which have thus\u000a      far been delivered orally at conferences and workshops (St. Andrews 2007,\u000a      Oxford 2008, Lampeter 2008).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24699","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    By reconstructing full-sized versions of miniature terracotta masks from\u000d\u000a      museum collections\u000d\u000a      around the world, the Masks for Menander project gained significant\u000d\u000a      insight on the tradition and\u000d\u000a      practice of an ancient performance style. This insight simultaneously\u000d\u000a      enabled theatre to recover\u000d\u000a      the acting style and cultural significance of a lost European mask theatre\u000d\u000a      tradition, and museums\u000d\u000a      to develop access and information to a wider public audience. Therefore,\u000d\u000a      the unique outcome of\u000d\u000a      this project is how Masks for Menander linked curatorial and\u000d\u000a      performance traditions, redefining the relationship between two\u000d\u000a      distinctive cultural practices.\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a     Figure 1: Reconstruction of\u000d\u000a        Greek comic mask,\u000d\u000a        Kelvingrove Art Gallery and\u000d\u000a        Museum\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a     Rediscovering lost, ancient theatre traditions\u000d\u000a      The Masks for Menander project, led by Moignard, shed light on the\u000d\u000a      traditions and practices of an era in theatre that heavily influenced\u000d\u000a      subsequent Roman playwrights Terence and Plautus and is considered\u000d\u000a      the source of a European comic tradition. Elements of Greek `New\u000d\u000a      Comedy' remain visible in modern drama, particularly the focus on\u000d\u000a      relationships and personalities, which was a departure from the Old\u000d\u000a      Comedy emphasis on politics and public affairs. Working in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with the Scottish Mask and Puppet Centre and Italian theatre company\u000d\u000a      VeneziaINscena, University of Glasgow researchers Moignard and Williams\u000d\u000a      sought to recover the\u000d\u000a      acting style and cultural significance of New Comedy. They highlighted the\u000d\u000a      influence of this lost\u000d\u000a      European mask theatre tradition by research in the studio with experienced\u000d\u000a      mask professionals,\u000d\u000a      training of drama students, public performances and other events.\u000d\u000a    Mask theatre is a unique combination of body movement and the visual\u000d\u000a      stimuli of the masks, which\u000d\u000a      are sculpted to appear to change with the facial expressions or movements\u000d\u000a      of the actor wearing\u000d\u000a      them. Scaling the masks up from miniature artefacts to life-sized models\u000d\u000a      using rapid prototype\u000d\u000a      techniques allowed theatre professionals, together with the researchers,\u000d\u000a      to focus on and work with\u000d\u000a      the theatrical properties of the masks.\u000d\u000a    While the initial performances fall outside the eligible timeframe for\u000d\u000a      impact, they were an important\u000d\u000a      element of practice-based research and served to enhance the researchers'\u000d\u000a      and practitioners'\u000d\u000a      awareness of the proficiency of acting in antiquity, paving the way for\u000d\u000a      subsequent impact. Since\u000d\u000a      2008, the exploration and demonstration of masks in ancient and\u000d\u000a      contemporary theatre, including\u000d\u000a      in collaborative projects with mask theatre professionals, has continued.\u000d\u000a      VeneziaINscena\u000d\u000a      established the International Centre for the Study and Use of Masks\u000d\u000a      (Centro Internazionale della\u000d\u000a      Maschera) in 2005 (after collaborating with the Masks for Menander\u000d\u000a      project). Since then, they have\u000d\u000a      continued to incorporate the mask reproductions in their work, offering\u000d\u000a      workshops in Greek drama\u000d\u000a      to train actors in the use of masks in the theatre, which draw on the\u000d\u000a      research findings of the\u000d\u000a      project. The Centre collaborated with the Accademia Teatrale Veneta to\u000d\u000a      hold an intensive month-long\u000d\u000a      workshop in July 2008 on the Greek masks.\u000d\u000a    The Director of the Scottish Mask and Puppet Centre describes the impact\u000d\u000a      of this collaboration:\u000d\u000a      For the first time since the 4th century AD, the project has uncovered the\u000d\u000a      relationship\u000d\u000a      between the terracotta miniatures and the actual theatre masks. The\u000d\u000a      reconstruction process\u000d\u000a      using 3D imaging and scanning has enabled life-sized reconstructions to be\u000d\u000a      made with sub-millimetre\u000d\u000a      accuracy of the originals. The small helmeted miniatures were the key to\u000d\u000a      unlocking\u000d\u000a      the lost theatre masks of Menander.

The repercussions\u000d\u000a      of this\u000d\u000a      collaboration are still ongoing in the lives of all whom took part.\u000d\u000a    In 2013, the mask reproductions were included in the BBC 2 programme Who Were\u000d\u000a          The Greeks?\u000d\u000a      (first broadcast 27 June 2013) and the original shells and moulds now\u000d\u000a      adorn the external facade of\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Mask and Puppet Centre in Glasgow, recast in stone.\u000d\u000a    Improving study and management of objects in museum collections &amp;\u000d\u000a        exhibitions\u000d\u000a      A tangible legacy of the Masks for Menander project lies in the evolution\u000d\u000a      of the work at the\u000d\u000a      University of Glasgow on the masks themselves as antiquities. This work is\u000d\u000a      providing insight into\u000d\u000a      ancient theatre to a wider public audience. More than 2,000 mask artefacts\u000d\u000a      survive in collections\u000d\u000a      across Europe. Using rapid prototyping technology, Moignard and Williams\u000d\u000a      3D-scanned around\u000d\u000a      fifty of the ancient masks preserved in the Kelvingrove, Ashmolean and\u000d\u000a      Fitzwilliam Museums, the\u000d\u000a      Shefton Museum, Newcastle, and the Museo Aeoliano Lipari,\u000d\u000a      Italy.

They used\u000d\u000a      3D imaging to scan around fifty New Comedy artefacts from UK and European\u000d\u000a      museums, and\u000d\u000a      conducted studio research with full-size reconstructions of the masks,\u000d\u000a      scaled exactly from the\u000d\u000a      three-dimensional coordinates.\u000d\u000a    Employing leading-edge 3D scanning technologies provided by the\u000d\u000a      University of Strathclyde's\u000d\u000a      Rapid Design and Manufacture Centre, the project broke new ground in\u000d\u000a      ancient theatre research.\u000d\u000a      This was achieved by reverse-engineering and rapid prototyping of the\u000d\u000a      artefacts, and by the\u000d\u000a      objectivity of the mask construction and studio research. The researchers\u000d\u000a      found the best of the\u000d\u000a      miniatures conserved both the proportions of full-size originals and the\u000d\u000a      `aspects' &#8212; balance, flow of\u000d\u000a      lines, asymmetries and other qualities of a performable mask. The\u000d\u000a      artefacts therefore provided\u000d\u000a      more significant evidence for ancient performance than had ever been\u000d\u000a      previously recognised.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27111","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The IMAGINES network's main aim is the organization of a series of\u000a      conferences devoted to universal themes that intend to offer a basis not\u000a      only for interdisciplinary debates on the impact of antiquity in the arts,\u000a      but also for open discussion on the diversity of reception(s) in different\u000a      cultural traditions. While the first conference (La Rioja in 2007,\u000a      published in 2008) gave an overview of the wide range and specific forms\u000a      of ongoing projects, the second meeting (Bristol, September 22nd-25th,\u000a      2010) focussed on a particular topic: Seduction and Power. The conference\u000a      explored the tensions and relations of gender, sexuality, and power in\u000a      reception, associated with concepts such as domination, magnetism and\u000a      attraction. Such themes dominated the plots and characters of myth and\u000a      drama, but also served to portray historical personages. A third\u000a      conference in Mainz (Germany) on the topic Magic and the Supernatural was\u000a      held in September 2012. The project's impact strategy has been to open up\u000a      the key research themes to the public and to engage with artists and\u000a      members of the creative and cultural industries. The Bristol conference,\u000a      co-funded by UWTSD and co-organised by Garc&#237;a Morcillo included an open\u000a      and public screening of silent movies with original music composed and\u000a      performed live by two students of the University of Bristol. The event was\u000a      followed by a discussion with the musicians about their work. As a result\u000a      of the success of this event, a second such event was organised at the\u000a      Faculty of Music of the University of Barcelona and moderated by Garc&#237;a\u000a      Morcillo, with the presence of the musicians.\u000a    The Imagines II, Seduction and Power conference's public engagement\u000a      strategy also included a collaborative public exhibition run with the\u000a      independent Bristol Galley (Eric Shanower: The Age of Bronze, Tuesday 21st\u000a      September to Sunday 26th September 2010). Jointly organised by Garc&#237;a\u000a      Morcillo and Knippschild (University of Bristol), the public exhibition\u000a      featured original artwork of the comic Age of Bronze, a graphic novel\u000a      series about the Trojan Wars, by the renowned and Eisner Prize awarded\u000a      American graphic novelist Eric Shanower. The exhibition sought to\u000a      demonstrate the influence of the reception of antiquity on a specific\u000a      manifestation of culture and showed how this shapes culture as such,\u000a      ranging from post-classical traditional art disciplines to contemporary\u000a      popular cultural expressions. Expanding on these themes, Shanower\u000a      delivered a free public lecture about his work at the gallery on Saturday\u000a      25 September entitled Trojan Lovers and Warriors: The Power of Seduction\u000a      in Age of Bronze. In this talk he drew on the work of the network to\u000a      explore how sex and power underpin the entire story of the Trojan War, and\u000a      how these themes weave together to create the stories we know today. Age\u000a      of Bronze presents the complete story of the world-famous War at Troy,\u000a      freshly retold for the 21st century. Its primary sources begin with\u000a      Homer's Iliad, and include the three major tragedians Aeschylus, Euripides\u000a      and Sophocles, as well as other Greek and Roman works such as Virgil's\u000a      Aeneid, and Medieval and Renaissance European sources, such as\u000a      Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida. From Schliemann to current research,\u000a      the art of Age of Bronze further incorporates archaeological excavations\u000a      of the places where the story took place: Mycenae, Knossos, and Pylos and\u000a      especially Troy itself. In September 2012, IMAGINES furthered its\u000a      commitment to bringing together scholars, students, the general public and\u000a      professionals working on or inspired by ancient topics.\u000a    Imagines III: Magic and the Supernatural hosted a public event at which\u000a      the renowned playwright and director Stephan Seidel (Staatstheater Mainz)\u000a      introduced to the public his work and his sources of inspiration in\u000a      ancient myth. He spoke about the connections between his work and ancient\u000a      myth and how this aspect is reflected in the staging of his plays.\u000a      Particular attention was paid during the talk to Seidel's reworking of the\u000a      Phaedra myth in his play \"Deine Liebe ist vielleicht tragischer als meine,\u000a      aber nicht dein Tod\" (\"Your love is perhaps more tragic than my love, yet\u000a      your death is not\") after Jean Racine. He explained to the audience how he\u000a      reads the characters of the play and the world they live in and how these\u000a      aspects are transferred into the physis of the actors on stage, into their\u000a      relationships, and how they are recreated within a given space and music.\u000a    The film maker Oliver Stone has also shared Garc&#237;a Morcillo's and Berti's\u000a      volume Hellas on Screen on his website and Facebook page, soliciting\u000a      discussions from his viewing community. He also visited (30th Jan 2012)\u000a      IMAGINES contributor, Angelos Chaniotis, Professor of Ancient History at\u000a      Princeton Institute of Advanced Study to speak about research on Alexander\u000a      in relation to his film Alexander: Revisited.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    IMAGINES is an interdisciplinary project and research group exploring the\u000a      influence and impact of antiquity on modern cultures.

Seduction and Power\u000a      challenges conventional relations of power, thus undermining tradition and\u000a      leading to unexpected turns and dramas. This explains the fascination with\u000a      this subject throughout the centuries. Some of the ancient seduction\u000a      stories and their reception studied in this volume are familiar, others\u000a      are not, but all of them are interesting. By focusing on the relation\u000a      between seduction and power this volume makes an original contribution not\u000a      only to reception studies but also to the diachronic study of gender and\u000a      emotion.\u000a    Monica S. Cyrino, Professor of Classics, University of New Mexico, USA.\u000a      Silke Knippschild and Marta Garc&#237;a Morcillo have brought together a\u000a      remarkable company of leading scholars and inspiring new voices who\u000a      explore how the persistent liaison between seduction and power is richly\u000a      exposed in modern receptions of the myths, histories, and images emanating\u000a      from the ancient world. In case studies extending from the Renaissance to\u000a      the present day, in a variety of media from the performing and visual\u000a      arts, the contributors to this volume reveal with compelling clarity and\u000a      scholarly insight how the power of seduction continues to be wielded by\u000a      ancient cultures, as their essays unpack the enduring fascination exerted\u000a      by the charismatic men and alluring women of antiquity upon later artists\u000a      and performers. This impressive collection represents an important\u000a      contribution to the field of reception studies, since it offers an\u000a      unfettered glimpse into our own fantasies and projections about the power\u000a      and eroticism so often and so intimately linked with the ancient world.\u000a    ","ResearchSubjectAreas":[{"Level1":"20","Level2":"5","Subject":"Literary Studies"},{"Level1":"21","Level2":"3","Subject":"Historical Studies"},{"Level1":"20","Level2":"2","Subject":"Cultural Studies"}],"Sources":"\u000a    \u000a      The Bristol Gallery, Millennium Promenade, Harbourside, Bristol.\u000a      Eric Shanower eric@hungrytigerpress.com\u000a\u000a      Stephan Seidel Staatstheater Mainz, Gutenberg Platz 7. 55116 Mainz\u000a      Oliver Stone.\u000a        http:\/\/www.oliverstone.com\/hellas-on-screen1\/\u000a        and\u000a        https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheOliverStone?rf=108729429151075\u000a        and\u000a        http:\/\/www.ias.edu\/about\/publications\/ias-letter\/articles\/2013-spring\/chaniotis-oliver-stone\u000a\u000a      Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 19.09.2012, No. 219, p N3\u000a        http:\/\/www.seiten.faz-archiv.de\/faz\/20120919\/fnuwd1201209193630699.html\u000a\u000a      Radio Rioja (Cadena SER), 04\/08\/2012\u000a        http:\/\/www.radiorioja.es\/2012\/08\/04\/mainz-alemania-acoge-el-congreso-imagines-iii-la-magia-y-lo-sobrenatural-\u000a          en-el-mundo-antiguo-organizado-por-la-ur\/\u000a\u000a    \u000a    ","Title":"\u000a    IMAGINES: Antiquity in the Visual &amp; Performing Arts\u000a    ","UKLocation":[{"GeoNamesId":"2654675","Name":"Bristol"}],"UKRegion":[{"GeoNamesId":"6269131","Name":"England"}],"UOA":"Classics","UnderpinningResearch":"\u000a    IMAGINES (www.imagines-project.org)\u000a      is an international and interdisciplinary project and research group\u000a      exploring the influence and impact of antiquity on modern cultures. A key\u000a      objective of the project is to enhance the understanding of different\u000a      forms of interpretation, appropriation or neglect of classical inheritance\u000a      across epochs and nations. Subject areas under investigation are theatre,\u000a      dance, cinema, opera, sculpture, architecture, painting, comics, design,\u000a      and photography. IMAGINES goes beyond the treatment of reception in\u000a      individual genres and periods, instead taking specific genres as starting\u000a      points and going on to explore their connections with other genres. The\u000a      project has been established as an international network coordinated by\u000a      members of the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, University of\u000a      Bristol, University of La Rioja and Barcelona, University of Mainz and the\u000a      Libera Universit&#224; di Lingue e Comunicazione (IULM) of Milan.

She is also co-editor of the two of the volumes\u000a      produced by the group.\u000a    IMAGINES' collective initiatives to date include three conferences in\u000a      different countries (2007 Logro&#241;o, Spain; 2010 Bristol, UK; 2012 Mainz,\u000a      Germany) and two academic volumes (a third is in preparation). The project\u000a      intends to offer a basis not only for interdisciplinary debate on the\u000a      impact of antiquity in the arts, but also for open discussion of the\u000a      diversity of reception(s) in different cultural traditions. Accordingly,\u000a      it searches for fluent dialogues and effective forms of collaboration\u000a      between academia, further education, and the arts and their public\u000a      audiences. A trademark of the project is collaboration with non-academic\u000a      specialists, leaders in their fields who draw on antiquity for inspiration\u000a      for their work, representing the impact of the ancient world in our time\u000a      and age. IMAGINES has so far collaborated with professionals in the fields\u000a      of architecture, music, graphic novels, and theatre (see details below).\u000a    Garc&#237;a Morcillo's research outputs have addressed issues such as the\u000a      reception of antiquity in the performing and visual arts from the\u000a      Renaissance to the twenty-first century, with particular reference to the\u000a      tensions and relations of gender, sexuality, eroticism and power in\u000a      reception. Such universal themes dictated plots and characters of myth and\u000a      drama, but also serve to portray historical figures, events and places\u000a      from Classical history. She has explored the ways that their changing\u000a      reception and reinterpretation across time has created stereotypes, models\u000a      of virtue or immoral conduct, that blend the original features from the\u000a      ancient world with a diverse range of visual and performing arts of the\u000a      modern era. This includes work on the construction of Roman Greeks\u000a      disseminated by Hollywood and European film, an image largely influenced\u000a      by the emergence of Christian figures both as protagonists and as\u000a      favourite victims of cinematic \"authoritarian\" Romans.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28194","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context\u000a    Putting flesh back on the bones is the clearest way of interpreting and\u000a      presenting the results of detailed research not only for academic\u000a      colleagues but also for non-specialists and the general public. Research\u000a      undertaken at The University of Manchester has influenced museum practice\u000a      across the country and achieved broad educational impact through lectures\u000a      and extensive exposure in the media. Reconstructions from Manchester have\u000a      received regular coverage in local, national and international newspapers\u000a      [5.9, 5.10]. They have also featured in TV programmes such as Channel 4's\u000a      `Time Team' and BBC 4's `Meet the Ancestors', as well in National\u000a      Geographic Television collaborations with the Greek National\u000a      Archaeological Museum, both broadcast (2011) and planned (2013) [5.3].\u000a    Impact on museum practice\u000a    When the Manchester team started there were virtually no such\u000a      reconstructions, and they were regarded as more fitting to waxwork shows\u000a      like Madame Tussaud's. Now, in the words of the Director of the Manchester\u000a      Museum, `facial reconstruction ... plays a major role in many exhibitions\u000a      around the world, and [Prag's] work is globally significant in that it has\u000a      shown that facial reconstruction is not speculative but ... has a high\u000a      degree of accuracy ... Prag's work ... is considered the standard for\u000a      facial reconstruction work in museum exhibitions, and many international\u000a      colleagues indicate they are aware of it when they visit us' [5.1]. Some\u000a      of the best examples of reconstructions by the Manchester team include:\u000a\u0009  \u000a    The popular gallery on `Making Faces' in the Manchester Museum ran\u000a      from 2002 to 2012. The museum does not record visitor numbers for\u000a      individual galleries, but the total figures for the whole museum recorded\u000a      121,857 visitors in 2002-3, rising to 375,332 in 2012-13 [5.8]. Of the\u000a      newly refurbished gallery, the Museum Director writes `As \"Ancient Worlds\"\u000a      comprises the main thoroughfare through the Museum, and the facial\u000a      reconstructions form a major part of the gallery, we can be confident that\u000a      a high proportion of visitors have engaged with the displays' [5.1].\u000a      Central here is the reconstruction of `Worsley Man', the decapitated head\u000a      of a man killed in the 1st century AD, probably as part of a ritual, and\u000a      discovered during peat-cutting on Chat Moss in 1958. He is currently the\u000a      focus of a collaboration between Professor Prag and other academics from\u000a      the University of Manchester and elsewhere, concentrating on the details\u000a      of his health, the manner of his death and the preservation of his head:\u000a      it will culminate in a new reconstruction involving high resolution\u000a      3-dimensional scanning that explains this graphically to the visitor. It\u000a      will also lead to a series of academic publications, enhancement of the\u000a      Museum display, and public dissemination through a television broadcast\u000a      (Bearkatt Productions for Channel 5, 2013-2014). The impact, then, is\u000a      on-going, with transferral of facial reconstruction skills and knowledge\u000a      beyond the University of Manchester.\u000a    At the British Museum, as the Head of the Italian collections in the\u000a      Department and curator of the Etruscan and other antiquities from pre-\u000a      Roman Italy can confirm, the reconstruction of the face of the Etruscan\u000a      noblewoman Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa remains a star attraction in the BM's\u000a      Greek and Roman galleries, because `visitors find a \"person\" to whom they\u000a      can relate across 2,000 years ... a very effective incentive to visitors\u000a      to find out more about the period and culture'. It was completed in 2002\u000a      in a research project that threw much new light on Etruscan life and death\u000a      and continues to have an impact today [5.2]. The Keeper, Department of\u000a      Greece and Rome at the British Museum estimates that `around 584,640\u000a      people see and engage with the reconstructed head of Seianti per year'\u000a      [5.2].\u000a    At the Museum of Underwater Archaeology in Bodrum (Turkey) the\u000a      reconstruction of the `Carian Princess' displayed in her `tomb' is one of\u000a      the highlights of the museum tour [5.5]. Other Manchester reconstructions\u000a      in Turkey can be found in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum and the\u000a      Museum of Anatolian Civilisations (Ankara), as well as the Pennsylvania\u000a      University Museum, at Mycenae museum and the National Archaeological\u000a      Museum in Greece and Archaeological Museum of Archanes (Crete), the Drents\u000a      Museum (Netherlands) and in museums across in the UK including the\u000a      Ashmolean (Oxford), Colchester, Leeds, Rochester and St Albans. Techniques\u000a      newly developed by the Manchester team form the basis of exhibits in the\u000a      new Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth which opened in May 2013.\u000a    An image of the reconstruction of the head of Lindow Man, the Iron Age\u000a      body found in Cheshire in 1984 and reconstructed in 1986 for the British\u000a      Museum, formed part of the museum's display until 2010 when the exhibition\u000a      focus changed; however, plans for the next refurbishment of the Iron Age\u000a      gallery include at least an image of the reconstruction.\u000a\u0009  \u000a\u0009  In the summation\u000a      of the Keeper of the Department of Greece and Rome at the British Museum,\u000a      `the importance of Professor Prag's interdisciplinary work can scarcely be\u000a      overstated. ... From a museum perspective, it is invaluable to be able to\u000a      show reconstructions of ancient faces that are not simply artists'\u000a      impressions, but are based on provable techniques ... The demonstrable\u000a      accuracy of the process ... is indeed impressive to visitors' [5.2]. The\u000a      Director of the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons, adds,\u000a      `The pioneering studies that [Prag] and Richard Neave have carried out\u000a      have had a significant impact on museum practice in the UK world-wide over\u000a      two decades. Beyond their considerable forensic value they have engaged\u000a      tens of thousands of visitors with osteological human remains in a\u000a      powerful and innovative way' [5.6]. Likewise, the Honorary Keeper at the\u000a      National Archaeological Museum in Athens testifies, `[Prag's work] had a\u000a      great impact to my work both as a field archaeologist ... and as a Museum\u000a      curator. It has provided me with important new tools to deal with age old\u000a      problems, from the identity of the Myceneans to making them more\u000a      attractive to the general public' [5.3]\u000a    Impact on public knowledge\u000a    It is not simply the `accessibility' to research results which these\u000a      reconstructions provide. It is very clear from reactions everywhere that\u000a      seeing the faces of ancestors or those who once inhabited the local area\u000a      has become a very important key to understanding the past (see also the\u000a      examples cited in the previous section). The work of the Manchester team\u000a      has long been a recurring lecture subject requested by bodies such as The\u000a      National Association of Decorative &amp; Fine Arts Societies and U3A, as\u000a      well as amateur archaeological and medical societies [5.7]. Visits to\u000a      Manchester reconstructions in Greek and Turkish museums have been a\u000a      selling point in the archaeological tours organised by Andante Travels, as\u000a      its Deputy Director can confirm [5.5]. In fact Andante introduced `Study\u000a      Days' into their programme in 2012, with two held in Manchester on facial\u000a      reconstruction in November 2012 and February 2013, both successful\u000a      (numbers are deliberately kept small so that those attending can see\u000a      clearly what is happening: 12 attended in November, 13 in February). In\u000a      the words of the Deputy Director, `Professor Prag has educated and\u000a      entertained many of our guests on a Study Day entitled Reconstructing\u000a      Faces ... and we have had very enthusiastic feedback about these. It\u000a      provides a very tangible contact with people from the past, and brings\u000a      their stories to life. The scientific approach is also well explained and\u000a      enjoyed' [5.5]. Three more have been requested for 2013-14. The popularity\u000a      of Manchester's facial recognition with these organisations demonstrates\u000a      the public interest in this type of work and the impact it is having on\u000a      increasing interest in past civilisations. Furthermore, heads\u000a      reconstructed for the National Archaeological Museum in Athens by the\u000a      Manchester team `were among the items most in demand' for a National\u000a      Geographic Television programme, and they will also feature in a related\u000a      exhibition in the US in 2013 [5.3].\u000a    Impact on archaeological knowledge\u000a    With new investigative techniques, facial reconstruction has now become\u000a      commonplace, and the techniques developed by Professor Prag and Richard\u000a      Neave, known as the `Manchester method', have been copied by other\u000a      practitioners around the world, perhaps most notably by an academic,\u000a      formerly Richard Neave's assistant and then successor at Manchester, now\u000a      at Dundee University &#8212; see e.g. `History Cold Case' series on BBC2\u000a      (2010-11) and most recently her very high-profile reconstruction of\u000a      Richard III (2013).\u000a    A prime instance was when the rediscovery in the National Archaeological\u000a      Museum in Athens of two complete skeletons from the 1876-77 excavations at\u000a      Mycenae led to a request from the Greek authorities to Professor Prag and\u000a      his team for a new research project to study and reconstruct them in\u000a      2006-2007. The work for the facial reconstructions and the related DNA and\u000a      strontium\/oxygen isotope analysis has initiated a re-assessment of our\u000a      understanding of the Greece in the Middle-Late Bronze Age, demonstrating\u000a      very clearly how the impact of what is a three-dimensional research report\u000a      stimulates a new approach to an `old' subject. [5.3, 5.4].\u000a    Requests for images of reconstructions from magazines and publishers of\u000a      popular works on history and archaeology still come in regularly from all\u000a      over the world [5.9, 5.10]. Making Faces by John Prag and Richard\u000a      Neave (London: British Museum Press, 1997\/1999) continues to be a popular\u000a      publication even though out of print.

An\u000a      important aspect in the reconstruction process is the ability to work\u000a      across disciplines to produce a complete picture.

The art of reconstructing faces by\u000a      methodically putting `flesh' back onto the bones has become a vital tool\u000a      for both forensic investigators and archaeologists. The work at Manchester\u000a      has developed cross-disciplinary aspects which have not only allowed a\u000a      focus on specific archaeological problems, but also facilitated the\u000a      dissemination of complex research results to fellow academics as well as\u000a      to the wider public. Throughout the research period since 1993 the\u000a      reconstruction techniques have improved exponentially in terms of the\u000a      anatomical data available and the materials used. Key findings of the\u000a      research include:\u000a    \u000a      The identification of the occupant of tomb II at Vergina in Greece as\u000a        Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great. This also\u000a        identified Vergina as Aigai, the early Macedonian capital.

This is particularly true for the history of medicine\u000a      where a constant exchange of ideas took place across the different shores\u000a      of the Mediterranean: throughout the medieval and early modern period,\u000a      authors from different countries and creeds&#8212;including Muslims, Jews, and\u000a      Christians&#8212;partook in the same medical and scientific discourse.\u000a    And yet, even today, one can tell the history of medicine with virtually\u000a      no reference to the important Muslim heritage. For instance, a prominent\u000a      academic wrote a thirty-part BBC radio programme entitled `The Making of\u000a      Modern Medicine' with nearly no reference to the Arabo-Islamic\u000a      contribution, although he started with the Greeks History of medicine is\u000a      sometimes similarly taught at GCSE level in schools. Pormann's research\u000a      helped rectify this situation.\u000a    Pathways\u000a    Professor Pormann's research attempts to counter this approach and\u000a      replace it with a different narrative.

It is based directly on the research commissioned\u000a      by the RCP and published in 3.1, but also draws on the other outputs\u000a      listed above. As the exhibition space at the RCP is in a central place\u000a      within the building, many visitors have seen it; to date the number of\u000a      visitors, most of them health professionals, is estimated as `several\u000a      thousand' [5.1] One visitor left the feedback `What an amazing insight\u000a      into the Islamic roots of the history of medicine' [5.1]. The Archive\u000a      Manager of the RCP adds that `[w]ithin the exhibition display and\u000a      catalogue Professor Pormann demonstrates how ideas and complete texts\u000a      continued to be translated and retranslated from Ancient Greek to 10th\u000a      century Arabic, to 16th century Latin, to 19th century English. Displaying\u000a      these texts side by side gives visitors a real sense of how ideas and\u000a      works survived through time. .... The visitor feedback has been\u000a      overwhelmingly positive, with many comments on how their appreciation of\u000a      the history of medicine and the cultural roots of medical science had been\u000a      widened' [5.1]. Further feedback from lecture evenings and other outreach\u000a      activities organised by the RCP document its wide impact, as does its web\u000a      presence [5.1]. The exhibition was also covered on al-Jazeera, Arabic, and\u000a      thus reached millions of Arabs and Muslims [5.1].\u000a    Impact on Professional Knowledge and Practice\u000a    The impact of Pormann's RCP exhibition and underpinning research has also\u000a      reached high profile medical professionals. One such example is one of the\u000a      founders of the Cochrane Collaboration and coordinator of the James Lind\u000a      Library (JLL). Both initiatives aim at helping to promote and understand\u000a      fair tests of treatments in health care. The founder comments that,\u000a      `Pormann's research ... offers interesting insights into the testing of\u000a      therapeutic procedures that have resonance today; and it shows that our\u000a      own medical tradition owes much more to the contribution of Arab and\u000a      Muslim scholars than one is normally led to believe' [5.6]. He adds that,\u000a      `The (Mirror of Health) exhibition, which aims to reveal the role of\u000a      Islamic innovation in the development of western medicine, is of great\u000a      significance in that it corrects several misconceptions perpetuated by\u000a      centuries of scholarship'. [5.6] He has publicised the exhibition on his\u000a      award-winning James Lind Library website [5.6], and also published\u000a      Pormann's `Qualifying and quantifying medical uncertainty in 10th century\u000a      Baghdad: Abu Bakr al-Razi' (later reprinted in the Journal of the Royal\u000a      Society of Medicine 106 (9): 370-2) as part of `Commentaries on the\u000a      history of treatment evaluation' [5.8]. This is a short piece that tries\u000a      out a new idea, namely that a tenth-century physician already adhered to\u000a      the notion of the `patient group', which became a key aspect of medical\u000a      trials later.\u000a    Furthermore, audiences consisting largely of security professionals at\u000a      the 10th International Security Forum, Geneva, commented positively on\u000a      Pormann's research and how it changed their perspective: an `eye opener',\u000a      according to one delegate [5.4].\u000a    Impact on Heritage Organizations and Users\u000a    The Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation made extensive use\u000a      of Pormann's research. This British not-for-profit, non-political, and\u000a      non-religious organisation, dedicated to researching and popularizing the\u000a      impact of Muslim civilization upon our scientific and cultural heritage,\u000a      publicized the RCP exhibition on four websites (FSTC, MH.com, CE4tF,\u000a      1001inventions) and via its considerable Facebook presence. This meant\u000a      that the exhibition reached new audiences, including young Muslims and\u000a      Muslim community leaders. But Pormann's research also influenced FSTC\u000a      itself, as the General Manager of FSTC, observes: `The exhibition and the\u000a      underlying research has influenced our way of thinking and will continue\u000a      to be reflected in our policies. By raising awareness of, and increasing\u000a      our understanding of a shared medical heritage, Professor Pormann has not\u000a      only helped develop and disseminate the ideals held by the FSTC; he has\u000a      also offered new views and additional insight into many of the issues the\u000a      Foundation strives to promote' [5.2]. For instance, they have come to a\u000a      much greater appreciation of al-R&#257;z&#299;'s relevance to early modern medical\u000a      practice, especially in the area of fighting small pox and measles.\u000a    Another user of Pormann's research is the British Muslim Heritage Centre\u000a      (BMHC), which aims at `inspiring all communities to embrace diversity, and\u000a      be instrumental in the shaping of a cohesive society'. It organised a\u000a      conference open to both scholars and the wider public, and notably the\u000a      Muslim community in Manchester. A Professor and Senior Researcher at the\u000a      BMHC writes that Pormann's lecture on the Mirror of Health, `made a great\u000a      contribution to our understanding of the history of medicine and\u000a      particularly the contributions of Arabic-Islamic scholars to the history\u000a      of Western medicine and also continuous exchanges between both\u000a      civilizations. We had a great positive feedback from the Muslim community\u000a      who frequently visit our centre' [5.3].\u000a    Impact on the Curriculum\u000a    The FSTC prominently advertised Pormann's exhibition on their website for\u000a      Curriculum Enrichment for the Future (CE4tF) &#8212; an organization which seeks\u000a      to `enrich school curricula in order to highlight the shared cultural and\u000a      scientific inheritance of humanity'. The Chief Executive Officer of CE4tF\u000a      writes that Pormann `has addressed us in meetings ... in order to help us\u000a      shape our curriculum agenda. His research, as published in Pormann's\u000a      Mirror of Health (RCP 2013) directly informs the content of the\u000a      educational materials that we produce. The initiatives not only affect\u000a      pupils and students in the UK, but also in the Middle East. For instance,\u000a      we have recently signed an agreement for teacher training in Saudi Arabia\u000a      for which, again, we are using some of Professor Pormann's research'\u000a      [5.7]. Moreover, Pormann has recently joined the advisory board of CE4tF,\u000a      which shows that his research continues to inform current and future\u000a      practice.\u000a    The impact of Pormann's research in the Middle East is also visible from\u000a      the testimony of a lecturer in ancient history at the most prestigious\u000a      Muslim University, Al-Azhar in Cairo. She describes the effect of Pormann\u000a      (3.1) on Egyptian undergraduate students as follows: `Its impact has been\u000a      apparent during lectures, in which students proved eager to draw from the\u000a      manuscripts' [5.5].\u000a    The partnerships with the RCP, FSTC, CE4tF, BMHC and the JLL constitute,\u000a      in themselves, incidences of impact [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.6]. But these\u000a      partnerships also function as pathways to impact in that the lives of a\u000a      significant number of people have been touched by the results of the\u000a      research outlined above.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The contribution of Muslim civilisation to the development of medicine is\u000a      often minimised, and differences between Islam and the West accentuated.\u000a      Pormann's research attempts to correct this distortion by showing links of\u000a      intellectual kinship between Islam and the West in the area of medicine.\u000a      Through partnerships with medical, educational and non-governmental\u000a      organisations, these findings impacted on large audiences and effected\u000a      changes in medical, educational, and security discourse. One result was\u000a      greater appreciation of the role played by Muslim physicians in the\u000a      history of vital clinical trials. Moreover, users responded positively to\u000a      the emphasis on Muslim contributions to medicine, and reported that their\u000a      perspective had been widened. Pormann's research thereby helped foster\u000a      community cohesion and educational achievement.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Manchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Manchester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007798}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"360630","Name":"Cairo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2660646","Name":"Genève"},{"GeoNamesId":"98182","Name":"Baghdad"}],"References":"\u000a    (AOR - Available on request)\u000a    The quality of research can be evidenced by the following key outputs,\u000a      all published by esteemed presses or high-quality journals. 3.1 is based\u000a      directly on work funded by the Royal College of Physicians.\u000a    \u000a3.1 Pormann PE 2013a: The mirror of health: discovering medicine in the\u000a      Golden Age of Islam (London: Royal College of Physicians), xii + 92 pp.\u000a      This is a short book accompanying the exhibition that contains many novel\u000a      insights both into the development of medicine in the Islamic world and\u000a      interest in the Islamic medical tradition at the Royal College of\u000a      Physicians.

The first major publication resulting from\u000a      the research was Professor Pormann's Mirror of Health (3.1) (London: Royal\u000a      College of Physicians), which appeared in May 2013 and on which the\u000a      exhibition The Mirror of Health is based (5.1). Pormann's research aimed\u000a      at:\u000a    1) studying the special collections of the Royal College of Physicians,\u000a      London, related to the Islamic world;\u000a    2) highlighting the many examples of shared heritage and intellectual\u000a      kinship between the medical traditions as they unfolded in Europe and the\u000a      Islamic world;\u000a    3) revealing the innovative nature of medicine as it developed in the\u000a      Islamic world.\u000a    The Archive Manager at the RCP, states that Pormann's `original academic\u000a      research of the collection of Islamic manuscripts and printed books in the\u000a      RCP's collection was vital to the development of the themes and narrative\u000a      of [the Mirror of Health] exhibition' [5.1]. In this research, Professor\u000a      Pormann built on earlier work, which has won him prizes (notably the\u000a      British-Kuwait Friendship Society Book Prize in Middle Eastern Studies)\u000a      and led to significant media exposure (notably BBC radio and televisions\u000a      programmes). His work in this area has also attracted significant grant\u000a      income of c. &#163;2m. Through his research at Manchester, he arrived at the\u000a      following conclusions:\u000a    \u000a      Physicians in the medieval Islamic world were far more innovative than\u000a        previously thought, as the examples of such as al-R&#257;z&#299; (d. 925) and\u000a        Avicenna (d. 1037) show. (3.1-2)\u000a      It was primarily the institutional set-up&#8212;and notably the Islamic\u000a        hospital&#8212;that led to some innovative research by physicians such as\u000a        al-R&#257;z&#299;. (3.1)\u000a      Renaissance medicine owes a tremendous debt to the Arabic medical\u000a        tradition in Latin translation, as demonstrated by the example of the\u000a        Royal College of Physicians in London. (3.1)\u000a      The eighteenth century saw a peak interest in al-R&#257;z&#299;'s innovative\u000a        work. The main interest of physicians such as Dr Richard Mead\u000a        (1673-1754) in al-R&#257;z&#299;'s work On Smallpox and Measles was clinical, not\u000a        historical. (3.1).\u000a    \u000a    Therefore, the Islamic medical heritage is rich and sophisticated on a\u000a      number of levels. Yet, as Alain de Libera has shown for philosophy, this\u000a      heritage has largely been forgotten, at least in certain circles. This\u000a      amnesia is not an innocent one, but can be linked to ideas about racial\u000a      and religious purity. This is as true for the Renaissance as it is for\u000a      today, as the examples of Leonard Fuchs and Sylvain Gouguenheim\u000a      illustrate.\u000a    The rich heritage of the Royal College of Physicians and its special\u000a      collections offer an important corrective to this perception: it provides\u000a      a wake-up call, raising us from this amnesia. This strand of research is\u000a      still productive: Pormann recently gave papers on various aspects related\u000a      to it at NYU Abu Dhabi, the 10th International Security Forum (Geneva),\u000a      the British Muslim Heritage Centre (Manchester), and the Royal College of\u000a      Physicians (London). These talks and related publications continue to feed\u000a      into the impact.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28224","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    1. Bringing new audiences to Aristophanes through accessible\u000a          translations\u000a    The research described in (2) above was disseminated through a \"revised\u000a      edition\" (actually, an almost complete rewrite) of the 1973 Penguin\u000a      translation of Acharnians, Clouds and Lysistrata (3g).\u000a      This work was designed especially to provide a closer translation which,\u000a      together with the introduction and annotations, would incorporate advances\u000a      in scholarship since 1973, including Prof. Sommerstein's own\u000a      contributions, among them the ideas published previously or subsequently\u000a      in (3b-f). In the five years 2008-2012 this volume sold a total of\u000a        46,668 copies across all parts of the English-speaking world and\u000a      beyond (more than 85% of them outside the UK, including 3,646 in India:\u000a      see 5.1). On the book recommendation site www.goodreads.com, from 1.1.2008\u000a      to 16.7.2013, the 2002 Penguin has received an average rating of 3.81 out\u000a      of 5 (5.2), and most of the comments indicate that both the comic and\u000a        political aspects of the plays have been successfully conveyed, often\u000a        to readers who previously knew little or nothing about ancient drama.\u000a      For more advanced students, the Aris &amp; Phillips editions of four other\u000a      plays (3a), completing a series covering all Aristophanes' eleven\u000a      surviving comedies, also provided a freshly constituted Greek text and\u000a      detailed commentaries.\u000a    2. Helping directors, performers and audiences\u000a        to \"engage with history and the present day\" through theatre productions\u000a    The Penguin translations have been selected as the basis of numerous theatre\u000a        productions (there were at least ten applications for permission to\u000a      perform them between January 2008 and July 2013), most notably a\u000a      production of Lysistrata at the University of Nottingham's\u000a      Lakeside Arts Centre Theatre in April 2013 to which Prof. Sommerstein\u000a      acted as consultant, providing important background information to the\u000a      director and offering \"a useful sounding board [for his] initial\u000a      explorations into the text and concepts for it\" (5.3). The director had\u000a      chosen Sommerstein's translation from ten he had read because its\u000a      \"language was the most accessible to the modern actor and audience\u000a      ...whilst all the time managing to stay faithful to the spirit of\u000a        Aristophanes[;... its] sense of fun and play and incredible\u000a      attention to period detail ... helped us to engage with history and\u000a        present day at the same time.\" (5.4)\u000a    The six performances drew an audience of 1,222 (over 50% above the\u000a      expected numbers: 5.3) from across the East and West Midlands, and\u000a      attracted significant media attention (e.g. from the Nottingham\u000a        Evening Post and the Guardian Online education section:\u000a      5.5). Feedback from the many school and college teachers and students who\u000a      attended was exceptionally enthusiastic: of 38 teachers who answered the\u000a      question \"How would you rate tonight's theatre education experience?\", 36\u000a      replied \"excellent\" (5.6), and their detailed comments showed that (as the\u000a      production team reported to the University afterwards) the production had\u000a      \"proved ... that classical Greek drama most definitely could be\u000a        accessible, very funny, and extremely relevant to audiences of today\"\u000a      and truly \"fit[ted] well with Lakeside's core aims of presenting\u000a        access to excellence across the visual, performing and participatory\u000a        arts\" (5.3).\u000a    In addition, Prof. Sommerstein recently assisted the National Theatre\u000a        (NT) to create a rounded presentation of Greek theatre for a\u000a        wide-ranging online audience by contributing, as one of three\u000a      speakers, to a short film on `Greek Comedy and Satyr Drama', published by\u000a      the NT in March 2013 on its YouTube Discover Theatre channel (http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H-BvMbfkxcc)\u000a      and aimed especially at \"students and teachers of English and Drama\". As\u000a      of 16.7.2013, this video had been viewed 2,120 times by a wide audience of\u000a      teachers, school children, theatre audiences, undergraduate students and\u000a      lifelong learners, thereby fulfilling \"the objective of the National\u000a      Theatre to create content that is rich with information and available to\u000a      all\". According to the NT's digital content producer, \"The contribution of\u000a      Alan Sommerstein was invaluable... as his particular knowledge on Greek\u000a      Comedy... illuminated that it was a vibrant, popular and important aspect\u000a      of Greek Theatre despite the greater prestige given to Greek Tragedy. It\u000a      was our objective to create a collection that presented Greek Theatre\u000a      fully and thanks to Alan's knowledge this objective was satisfactorily\u000a      met\" (5.7-8).\u000a    3. Contributing defining texts to curricula in Classics and Theatre\u000a          Studies throughout the English-speaking world\u000a    Both the Aris &amp; Phillips editions and the 2002 Penguin translations\u000a      are also now used as prescribed or recommended texts in several units of\u000a      the OCR and AQA AS and A-level Classics syllabi: OCR AS Unit AH1, A2 Unit\u000a      G3, &amp; A2 Unit CC9 (cf. 5.9a); and AQA AS Unit 1 Civ 1 &amp; A2 Unit 4\u000a      Civ 4: (cf. 5.9b). These texts give sixth-formers the opportunity of\u000a      studying versions of the plays which are much more accurate, and\u000a        reflect more up-to-date scholarship, than those previously in use\u000a      (including the same translator's 1973 Penguin), without sacrificing intelligibility\u000a        or approachability. A teacher at Loughborough Grammar School wrote\u000a      that the Aris &amp; Phillips Thesmophoriazusae \"proved invaluable\u000a      for the students ... [and] brought the comedy alive\" (5.10). They have\u000a      also proved an inspiration to teachers and students of Drama and Theatre\u000a      Studies, for which the Penguin translation of Lysistrata has since\u000a      2009\/10 been designated as a set text within sections A and B of the\u000a      \"Theatre Text in Context\" compulsory unit in the Edexcel A-level, A2\u000a      syllabus (5.9c). A teacher of Drama at Barking Abbey School wrote that\u000a      this translation had helped students to \"come up with some really\u000a      excellent concepts about how they would realise their concept of the play\"\u000a      (5.10).\u000a    In addition, the Aris &amp; Phillips editions are now widely used as\u000a      course texts in HEIs throughout the English-speaking world (as evidenced\u000a      in 5.11 by statements and course descriptions from the UK, USA and New\u000a      Zealand), and they often inform course content along with the key articles\u000a      listed above (especially 3b) and with Sommerstein's Greek Drama and\u000a        Dramatists (London: Routledge, 2002) in the role of a reference\u000a      textbook.

Evidence of\u000a      its influence since 2008 has been received from 30 HEIs (5.1). These span\u000a      14 countries from the UK to China and six continents, especially Europe,\u000a      Australasia and above all North America, including Ivy League institutions\u000a      (Cornell; Dartmouth; Princeton); public universities (e.g. Berkeley;\u000a      Calgary; Rutgers); and liberal arts colleges (Reed). To quote one\u000a      Princeton academic, \"the work of no other scholar, living or dead,\u000a      has had a greater impact on the research of my students... or on my\u000a        ability to teach these two courses [in 2008 &amp; 2012]\".\u000a    This influence stems from Hodkinson's own writings and his edited books\u000a      (3.4-3.6), which \"provide in depth study for my students beyond any\u000a      single-authored book\" (Emory). \"Their examination of wider themes means\u000a      their implications extend beyond teaching on Sparta alone\" (Napoli II).\u000a    Several academics stated how the research had influenced the form and\u000a        content of curricula: \"Hodkinson's work had a profound influence on\u000a      the content and design of that course\" (Dartmouth); \"Hodkinson's recent\u000a      work informed not only much of the teaching, but also the redesign of the\u000a      course\" (Winnipeg); \"in devising this course, I had Prof. Hodkinson's\u000a      research directly in mind\" (Adelaide). The debate on Spartan\u000a        exceptionalism in 3.4 has had an especially major impact: \"Sparta:\u000a        Comparative Approaches (2009) enabled me to create a new overarching\u000a      framework for the course\" (Calgary); \"Hodkinson's work was particularly\u000a      influential in the course design, including the title [Sparta: An\u000a      Extraordinary City] drawn from Hodkinson 2009\" (Lampeter). Similar\u000a      comments were received from HEI teachers at Adelaide, Berkeley, Dartmouth,\u000a      Princeton and Winnipeg.\u000a    Several testimonies highlighted major influences on student learning:\u000a      \"my students have been strongly influenced by his research\" (Reed); \"you\u000a      had a profound impact on the class\" (Princeton). A PhD student at Warsaw\u000a      described how during his UG studies Hodkinson's research had \"had a deep\u000a      influence... for direction of my academic development\". A current MA\u000a      student at Rio wrote: \"Your work is a reference for me and my academical\u000a      experience.\" A former MA student (2009) at Kwazulu-Natal commented on \"the\u000a      methodological paradigms it provides\". At Nanjing the impact extended\u000a      beyond the curriculum: \"Between 2010 and 2012 some students... formed a\u000a      voluntary study group, where they read Hodkinson's 2006 paper and\u000a      discussed wider problems such as the criteria for a military society [and]\u000a      comparisons between Spartan and modern Japanese militarism\".\u000a    One result has been greater numbers studying Sparta. At Adelaide,\u000a      from 29 in 2006, \"the new Hodkinson-inspired course had 51 students in\u000a      2008, and 88 in 2010\". At Lampeter numbers rose annually from 15 in\u000a      2009\/10 to 94 in 2012\/13; at Winnipeg from 47 in 2010\/11 to 63 in 2012\/13.\u000a    (ii) Enriching UK secondary teaching and learning, and inspiring\u000a        pupils' aspirations.\u000a      Hodkinson's research engagement with schools has enriched secondary\u000a      teaching and learning, inspiring pupils' educational ambitions. Initially,\u000a      this took place through talks on Sparta's modern receptions (cf. 3.5-6) at\u000a      the East Midlands Association of Classical Teachers 6th form days and an\u000a      article in the national schools magazine Omnibus 52, 2006. For\u000a        one pupil, his Feb 2008 EMACT talk on `Spartan Militarism in 20th-century\u000a        International Politics' proved a career-changing event. In 2011,\u000a      when inviting Hodkinson to give the inaugural lecture of Clare College\u000a      Cambridge's History Society, he recalled, \"It still ranks among the best I\u000a      have ever attended... I remember leaving filled with ideas about why I\u000a      should study History\" (5.2). After Cambridge, the student went on to PG\u000a      study of international politics in 2012\/13 through an MA in International\u000a      Relations at Yale.\u000a    Recently Hodkinson used his research on ancient Sparta (3.1-4) to assist\u000a      schools taking OCR's AS &amp; GCSE Sparta options (units AH1 &amp; A353).\u000a      In September 2012 he spoke on \"New Approaches to Classical Sparta\" to 50\u000a      teachers at the Joint Association of Classical Teachers INSET day. Several\u000a        testified to the talk's major influence on their teaching (5.3). It\u000a      \"was centrally important to the approach I took\" (modern history\u000a      re-trainee, Grey Coat Hospital, London); \"as an NQT,... this has\u000a      influenced how I approach my teaching\" (Simon Langton Girls' Grammar,\u000a      Canterbury); \"I had more insight when discussing historical viewpoints of\u000a      Sparta with my own students\" (OCR exam marker, Queen Mary's College,\u000a      Basingstoke). \"Hodkinson's talk and publications... have given me greater\u000a      confidence in questioning the nature of evidence presented in standard\u000a      textbooks\" (Bancroft's School, Essex). The talk's impact led JACT's Journal\u000a        of Classics Teaching to solicit its publication in JCT's\u000a      Spring 2013 issue \"as an effective way to improve teacher subject\u000a      knowledge\" (5.4).\u000a    During 2012\/13 Hodkinson then liaised with teachers to give follow-up\u000a      research-led talks at several schools (state, grammar, independent &amp; 6th\u000a      form college). His talks greatly enhanced the pupils' performances and\u000a        raised their aspirations. \"The materials... helped the students to\u000a      perform strongly on this unit\" (Leicester Grammar School). \"[The talk]\u000a      clearly moved the students' analytical development forward... the speech\u000a      had a profound and very positive impact\" (QMC). At Grey Coat, an inner\u000a      London girls' comprehensive, teaching Ancient History for the first time,\u000a      \"the talk ... significantly improved pupils' understanding of how to\u000a      approach the study of Sparta\". \"The AS results [were] significantly above\u000a      the school average\" and pupils \"did better on the Sparta paper\" than on\u000a      other modules \"with an average of 77% &#8212; high B grade\". \"A large\u000a      majority... have continued... on to A2 and there are two who are planning\u000a      on applying to university to study the subject\" (5.3).\u000a    (iii) Influencing and enhancing cultural heritage policies in the\u000a        modern city of Sparti.\u000a\u0009\u0009Hodkinson's account of a civic-oriented, less\u000a      militaristic and less exceptional Sparta (3.3-4) has altered the\u000a        Municipality of Sparti's depictions of its ancient legacy. According\u000a      to the Mayor of Sparti (5.5), his \"publications over the last 10 years\u000a      have changed how the Municipality presents its cultural heritage from\u000a      ancient Sparta... His research has led the Municipality to present ancient\u000a      Sparta as a civic-minded culture with important lessons to offer Greece in\u000a      its current situation.\"\u000a    These new understandings have been communicated by engaging with local\u000a      government agencies (Office of the Mayor; Department of Culture, Sports\u000a      &amp; Environment; Central Public Library) through Nottingham's Centre for\u000a      Spartan and Peloponnesian Studies (CSPS), of which Hodkinson is\u000a      co-director. He has also disseminated his research in the city through\u000a      personal lectures (April 2005; June 2006; April 2009; Sept 2010; March\u000a      2012) in Greek and English to audiences including local officials,\u000a      teachers and the wider public (5.5); and by donations of his publications,\u000a      academic and popular, to the Library's local history collection, much-used\u000a      by local teachers and students (5.6).\u000a    He has also helped the Municipality fulfil the cultural heritage\u000a        policy objectives in its current business plan: (a) enhancement of\u000a      the local cultural heritage; (b) the quantitative and qualitative\u000a      improvement of its cultural services; (c) an increase in visitors (5.7).\u000a      This has been achieved by linking his research dissemination to public\u000a      international conferences co-organised by CSPS with the Municipality and\u000a      held in the Central Public Library. Statements by the Mayor &amp; Library\u000a      Director attest how these research events have greatly assisted local\u000a      cultural heritage policies: enhancing public understanding of the city's\u000a      ancient past, providing an important new cultural service, bringing in\u000a      Greek and foreign visitors, and extending the Library's cultural and\u000a      educational outreach (5.5-6). CSPS's research activities are now embedded\u000a      in the Municipality's 2012-14 Business Plan, whose action points include\u000a      further joint conferences supported by &#8364;5K annual funding (5.7).\u000a    Finally, Hodkinson's publications and international research\u000a      collaborations have greatly aided the Municipality's promotion of the\u000a        city in Greece and abroad. His contributions were recognised in 2010\u000a      by the award of Honorary Citizenship. According to the award citation,\u000a      \"his scholarly research has made the history of ancient Sparta and Lakonia\u000a      known throughout the world\" (5.8).\u000a    (iv) Responding to 300: enabling authenticity in\u000a        comics writing via historical consultancy.\u000a      Nottingham research has enabled a comics author to achieve a more\u000a      authentic fictional portrayal of Spartan society in the comics series, Three\u000a      (Image Comics, Oct. 2013-Feb. 2014): a story of three helots set during\u000a      Sparta's 4th-century crisis. In the author's own words (5.10),\u000a        \"without recent Nottingham research, THREE would have been a different\u000a        and much poorer work\".\u000a    Three was written as a response to Frank Miller's graphic novel\u000a      and Zack Snyder's film 300. The author's initial research was\u000a      influenced by Fotheringham's paper (3.6) and podcasts on Miller's 300\u000a      (www.nottingham.ac.uk\/videos\/2008\/march\/bloodandthunderpart1.aspx) and by\u000a      Hodkinson's paper on helotage (3.1). On Fotheringham's advice, he asked\u000a      Hodkinson to act as consultant. From July 2012 to July 2013 Hodkinson\u000a      supplied in-depth `authenticity critiques' throughout the production of\u000a      both text and images, drawing on his research on helotage, Spartiate\u000a      military and civic culture, and female roles (3.1-3). The author also\u000a      visited Nottingham to consult other Classics and CSPS staff.\u000a    The author's published interviews and factual statement (5.9-10) stress the\u000a        depth of Hodkinson's influence. \"Some of it was purely factual...\u000a      Other areas were larger and more conceptual, with him bringing something\u000a      from his original work which added to what I was already exploring.\u000a      There's a section about a particularly rich Spartan mother... which was\u000a      distinctly aided from that.\" \"I had high hopes for the Three project. They\u000a      would undoubtedly been dashed without Stephen's assistance.\"\u000a    In particular, Hodkinson's input helped the author to counter-balance\u000a      300's over-glorification of the Spartiates and neglect of\u000a        their exploitation of the helots, thereby enabling the author to draw\u000a        out modern socio-political connections. \"His help makes both\u000a      Spartans and helots... truer to our best knowledge of them and... more\u000a      resonant with how we perceive class today\" (5.10).\u000a    The ground-breaking impact of the consultancy is shown (5.11) by\u000a      Hodkinson's unprecedented naming in pre-release `solicits' (noted by\u000a      comics news sites and prospective readers: \"the first time I've ever seen\u000a      a historical consultant accredited in a comic book\": `King's_Gambit',\u000a      07.13.13) and by the credits to Hodkinson, Fotheringham and the Department\u000a      of Classics in the comic's prelims.\u000a    (v) Countering Sparta's (mis)appropriation in U.S. gun control\u000a        debates.\u000a      Hodkinson's research (3.3) has helped improve the quality of evidence in\u000a      U.S. gun control debates, enabling an activist to counter Sparta's\u000a        appropriation by the pro-gun lobby. In May 2013, the activist, aware\u000a      of Sparta in Modern Thought (3.6), asked whether the gun lobby's\u000a      use of Leonidas' saying \"Molon labe\" as a rallying-cry against gun control\u000a      matched the reality of Sparta's policy on bearing arms. Hodkinson supplied\u000a      a detailed `academic opinion' that the Spartiates normally went unarmed in\u000a      everyday life and that the \"Molon labe\" saying was of dubious historical\u000a      authenticity.\u000a    On 9 June 2013 the activist posted Hodkinson's academic opinion on the Ceasefire\u000a        Oregon, New Trajectory blog, followed by his own\u000a      interpretative post, in which he was able to argue that the academic\u000a        opinion showed that historical Spartan practice formed a poor precedent\u000a        for and even undermined gun lobby arguments (5.12). By 16 July 2013\u000a      the posts had over 1600 direct hits and the blog site as a whole had a\u000a      much higher than normal hit rate in the week of posting. The posts were\u000a      also advertised in the online newsletter of States United to Prevent\u000a        Gun Violence. Many of the direct hits came via The Gun Wire\u000a      news clearing-house, much-read by the gun lobby. Explicit gun lobby\u000a      discussion has not been traceable, owing to their practice of hiding\u000a      discussions of awkward evidence from public view: silent testimony perhaps\u000a      to the posts' effectiveness (5.13).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Revision of standard views of Sparta towards a less exceptional, more\u000a      civic-oriented, society has:\u000a    \u000a       transformed curricula, teaching and student learning on Sparta in\u000a        HEIs worldwide\u000a       enriched teaching and inspired pupils' educational ambitions in UK\u000a        schools and FE colleges\u000a       altered the modern Municipality of Sparti's depiction of its ancient\u000a        legacy and enhanced its cultural heritage policies\u000a       helped a comics author respond to 300 with a more authentic\u000a        depiction of Spartan-helot relations\u000a       enabled a U.S. gun control activist to counteract Sparta's\u000a        appropriation by the pro-gun lobby.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    The University of Nottingham\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Nottingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Nottingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10007154}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"253394","Name":"Spárti"},{"GeoNamesId":"2078025","Name":"Adelaide"},{"GeoNamesId":"3172394","Name":"Naples"},{"GeoNamesId":"6183235","Name":"Winnipeg"},{"GeoNamesId":"972062","Name":"Province of KwaZulu-Natal"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1.

This develops\u000a      aspects of his pre-2003 work on Sparta, but takes it in new directions,\u000a      especially comparative perspectives on helotage and on the agency of\u000a      Spartan women, the relation between Sparta's military and civic elements,\u000a      its alleged exceptional character, and its appropriations in modern\u000a      thought. The last strand includes research by Lynn Fotheringham (Lecturer\u000a      in Classics since 1999) on recent novelistic treatments of Thermopylae.\u000a    Much of this research has been conducted within two collaborative\u000a      contexts in which Hodkinson assembled teams of scholars to produce edited\u000a      books on the above themes:\u000a    (i) International Sparta Seminar meetings, which he co-organised in 2004\u000a      and 2006 (cf. 3.3 &amp; 3.5)\u000a    (ii) His AHRC project, \"Sparta in Comparative Perspective\", 2004-10,\u000a      conducted in the context of Nottingham's Centre for Spartan &amp;\u000a      Peloponnesian Studies, which he co-founded in 2005 (3.4; 3.6).\u000a    The main insights stem from revision of standard interpretations of\u000a      Sparta as an exceptional polis in favour of a more civic-oriented society\u000a      operating within the range of Greek norms; and a deeper understanding of\u000a      the intellectual and political roots of modern interpretations. More\u000a      specifically:\u000a    \u000a       Comparative study of helotage (3.1; cf. 3.3 &amp; 3.4) sheds new\u000a        light on the Spartiates' exploitation of the helots, especially the\u000a        varying nature of their intervention in helot life and the opportunities\u000a        for helot families and communities to exercise some degree of agency\u000a        over their everyday affairs.\u000a       Comparative study of female possession and use of property (3.2)\u000a        challenges views of Spartiate women as exceptionally `liberated' en\u000a          bloc, suggesting instead varying and changing class-based effects\u000a        upon the status and capacities of different women in diverse contexts of\u000a        Spartiate life.\u000a       Study of ancient accounts of Sparta's military characteristics and\u000a        analysis of their actual social impact (3.3) subvert the view that\u000a        contemporary writers uniformly presented Spartan society as primarily\u000a        oriented towards military values and suggest that its military features,\u000a        though significant, were not dominant over either the civic or the\u000a        private aspects of Spartiate citizen life.\u000a       Comparison with other Greek city-states (3.4) suggests that, though\u000a        Spartan society presented certain unique features, it was not\u000a        qualitatively different overall; nor was it quasi-totalitarian in\u000a        character. Sparta's exceptional aspects stemmed from its success in\u000a        achieving socio-economic and political goals shared by many other Greek\u000a        poleis, but to which most of them could only aspire.\u000a       Studies of Sparta's appropriations in modern thought (3.5; 3.6)\u000a        reveal the contingent intellectual and political roots of its\u000a        predominantly negative images, especially its identification with\u000a        militaristic and totalitarian regimes like Nazi Germany and the Soviet\u000a        Union. Fotheringham's chapter in 3.6 explores one exception to such\u000a        negative images: Sparta's portrayal in recent fictional accounts of the\u000a        battle of Thermopylae, which depict its alleged military focus in\u000a        positive terms, whilst downplaying problematic aspects of Spartan\u000a        society such as the exploitation of the helots.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30217","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The first-phase of the research and the sea trials, and subsequent\u000d\u000a      modifications to the reconstruction, have had continuing impact, through\u000d\u000a      popular scientific publications, mass media, and museum exhibitions.\u000d\u000a      Impact is in Cultural Life, primarily through preserving, conserving and\u000d\u000a      presenting cultural heritage, developing stimuli to tourism and enhancing\u000d\u000a      the experience of tourists. The Olympias is an important cultural\u000d\u000a      and national symbol for Greece (see below), sparking discussions about\u000d\u000a      Greek (maritime) heritage. The trireme was funded by the Greek government\u000d\u000a      in relation to the Olympic legacy (whence its name), functioned as a\u000d\u000a      floating `ambassador' for Greek heritage, and remains identified with the\u000d\u000a      Olympics (see below). It has also had economic impact in encouraging\u000d\u000a      tourism, especially to the important Hellenic Navy museum (and associated\u000d\u000a      commercial facilities) in the redevelopment of Neo Faliro.\u000d\u000a    The beneficiaries of research have not been limited to particular\u000d\u000a      communities. Television and other media have commented upon or used the\u000d\u000a      trireme as a major element in presentation in UK, US, Greece. Museums have\u000d\u000a      adopted the trireme or part thereof in UK. A segment appears in The Henley\u000d\u000a      River and Rowing Museum where it was in place from 1998 and has continued\u000d\u000a      to be exhibited through the REF period to the present. An exhibit\u000d\u000a      featuring elements of the Olympias figured in the The Millenium\u000d\u000a      Dome (2000) and was then transferred to Manchester Museum (currently\u000d\u000a      off-exhibition). The Olympias herself has been in Greece (Piraeus)\u000d\u000a      from 2005 and has remained on exhibition (with intermittent\u000d\u000a      refurbishments) to the present. The Olympias has considerable\u000d\u000a      recognition in Greece as a symbol of Greece's maritime heritage.\u000d\u000a    Dissemination of the research and public impact was achieved through the\u000d\u000a      Trireme Trust, which Professor Rankov chairs, and by means of publications\u000d\u000a      (see above) and three conferences organised by Professor Rankov. Rankov's\u000d\u000a      research has informed the partial reconstruction of the trireme in the\u000d\u000a      River and Rowing Museum at Henley (one of the Daily Telegraph's\u000d\u000a      `top 50 museums in the world'). A permanent video display features\u000d\u000a      Professor Rankov and explains the sea-trials conducted on the ship and\u000d\u000a      their importance.\u000d\u000a    The ship itself is on display at the Hellenic Navy Museum in Neo Faliro,\u000d\u000a      Piraeus. The Museum commemorates Greek maritime history and the importance\u000d\u000a      of Greek naval power in asserting national independence. Together with the\u000d\u000a      Averof, the Olympias forms the centrepiece of the Museum,\u000d\u000a      and establishes continuity in Greek naval traditions from the Classical\u000d\u000a      period to the Modern Greek state. The presence of the Museum has been at\u000d\u000a      the centre of the major regeneration of the landscape in recent years.\u000d\u000a      More than 40,000 visitors per year visit the museum, the majority of them\u000d\u000a      Greek schoolchildren (personal verbal communication from Captain Leonidas\u000d\u000a      Tsiantoulas HN, Museum Director). A web search found 249 discussions or\u000d\u000a      uses of imagery of the trireme, mostly on Greek sites (below). These\u000d\u000a      include videos, discussions and blogs related to Greek identity and the\u000d\u000a      Olympic Games and sites related to Greek naval tradition, both military\u000d\u000a      and merchant marine.\u000d\u000a    In the UK, a full-scale interactive model of a section of the ship has,\u000d\u000a      since its opening in 1998, been one of the highlight exhibits at the River\u000d\u000a      and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-Thames. The relationship between the exhibit\u000d\u000a      and Professor Rankov's research on the sea trials (as discussed in the\u000d\u000a      publications above) is explored through a video presentations. In this\u000d\u000a      video, Professor Rankov explains the origins of his joint research\u000d\u000a      project, how he and his team have used the ship as an archaeological\u000d\u000a      experiment through the sea-trials, how he recruited a crew of 170 rowers\u000d\u000a      was recruited to carry out the experiments he had designed with the team,\u000d\u000a      and what they learnt about the practical viability of the design, the\u000d\u000a      problems of command, control and communication, and the potential\u000d\u000a      performance of this type of vessel under oar and sail.\u000d\u000a    The trireme has crossed into popular culture in an episode of Inspector\u000a        Morse (\"Greeks Bearing Gifts\") first shown in 1991. The ship has\u000d\u000a      been discussed in detail in videos and television programmes on the\u000d\u000a      ancient world (especially in the context of the development of Greek\u000d\u000a      democracy) made in the UK, the USA and other countries, mostly pre-2008,\u000d\u000a      but reshown regularly.\u000d\u000a    These films, exhibits and publications have enabled those who have seen\u000d\u000a      them to understand much more clearly some of the technological\u000d\u000a      achievements of Classical Greece and the conditions in which ordinary\u000d\u000a      seamen laboured in antiquity as a form of human engine.\u000d\u000a    The public profile of Olympias and her association with Classical\u000d\u000a      Greece led to the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games\u000d\u000a      (LOCOG) approaching Professor Rankov to arrange for the ship to be rowed\u000d\u000a      on the Thames carrying the Olympic flame on the opening day of the Games\u000d\u000a      (27 July, 2012). The subsequent withdrawal of the request caused a\u000d\u000a      diplomatic incident, involving the Greek Minister of Defence. There was\u000d\u000a      extensive coverage in the UK press (for instance, Financial Times,\u000d\u000a      19 April, 2012).

Rankov's role in this\u000d\u000a      multi-disciplinary project was to design and co-direct the ship's sea\u000d\u000a      trials.

It\u000a      centred on a large imperial sea-front villa, Laurentum, legendary\u000a      point of arrival of the Trojan hero Aeneas in Latium, as celebrated in\u000a      Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid. Laurentum had its own harbour and a\u000a      direct road to Rome and was backed by an eponymous imperial estate, and by\u000a      a veteran colony, both administered from an imperial village (Vicus\u000a        Augustanus). The villas of other members of the imperial family and\u000a      inner imperial circle clustered to either side, including that of Pliny\u000a      the Younger, whose letter describing his Laurentinum has\u000a      influenced architectural imaginations since the 16th century.\u000a    Research and impact area: 8.5 kilometres of the ancient shoreline,\u000a      including standing remains of the imperial villa, the Vicus Augustanus\u000a      and probably also the villa of Pliny, run through the seaward reaches of\u000a      the presidential estate of Castelporziano, the modern incarnation of the\u000a      ancient imperial estate. Major excavations at the imperial villa in\u000a      1774-1801 and at the Vicus in 1874-1913 were never published and\u000a      although left open became increasingly invisible after the 1950s, when\u000a      local pastoralism stopped and the natural forest invaded, assisted by new\u000a      plantations. Access has never been easy (previous owners were the\u000a      monarchy, and a series of autocratic barons) and archaeology never a\u000a      priority; the estate was a hunting preserve which has since become a\u000a      nature preserve. In 1983 Claridge, then Assistant Director of the British\u000a      School at Rome, was instrumental in bringing about contact between the\u000a      local archaeological authority and the estate management, which led to the\u000a      institution by the local authority of a programme of survey and\u000a      conservation, and she has remained the principal investigator ever since,\u000a      first at Oxford University, School of Archaeology (1994-9), and now at\u000a      Royal Holloway (from 2000).\u000a    At Royal Holloway, the primary research has been able to expand beyond an\u000a      initial close focus on the vicus to address the wider\u000a      archaeological landscape:\u000a    a. (2002- 5) New survey in collaboration with Dr Jari Pakkanen,\u000a      lecturer at Royal Holloway and students of the Classics department mapped\u000a      and analysed four adjacent sites to the west of the Vicus, experimenting\u000a      with different techniques for accurate topographical survey under the\u000a      forest conditions, notably a 3D digital terrain model (DEM)\u000a    b. (2006-10) An AHRC Major Research Grant obtained by Claridge and\u000a      Prof Helen Rendell (Loughborough University), building on an earlier\u000a      collaboration (when Rendell was at Sussex university), funded the\u000a      extension of the DEM and geophysical surveys integrated with\u000a      geomorphological and palaeo-environmental studies.

After close study of those that survive\u000a      in the Joye collection of the British Film Institute (BFI), Wyke and\u000a      Michelakis chose a representative selection of 34 silent films to screen,\u000a      with piano accompaniment, nationally and internationally. These included\u000a      screenings at UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 1 (2009; enthusiastically previewed\u000a      on BBC Radio Night Waves; audience c. 300, with some travelling from\u000a      Germany, Portugal and the USA); UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 2 (2009; audience\u000a      c. 200); the Getty Villa Los Angeles (2010; audience c. 250); the Berlin\u000a      Zeughauskino (2011; reviewed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Faz.net);\u000a      Bristol's Wickham Theatre (2011, audience c. 70); the University of\u000a      Washington, Seattle (2013, audience c. 100) and UCL's Bloomsbury Theatre 3\u000a      (2013; audience c. 200). Wyke and Michelakis contributed programme notes,\u000a      introductions to the project, and detailed talks on the films screened,\u000a      which were followed by public discussion. Audiences totalling about 1,200\u000a      people, comprised the general public, silent film fans, school children,\u000a      students and academics from a wide variety of higher education\u000a      institutions [see 1.1 in section 5].\u000a    The reception of these activities by silent film enthusiasts may be\u000a      gauged by reviews in special interest blogs such as The Bioscope\u000a      or Bible Films. For instance, in its review of the UCL Bloomsbury\u000a      1 event, The Bioscope wrote enthusiastically of the promise of\u000a      fresh insights and new angles that would emerge from having the films\u000a      exhibited by a classical studies department. The reviews also highlighted\u000a      the impacts of the events in terms of engaging new audiences with these\u000a      films. Thus the Bioscope reviewer continued: \"Of course, we hacks\u000a      turned up and occupied the front row, but the theatre was full of some 250\u000a      or so new enthusiasts, who had for the most part never seen such films,\u000a      and who were clearly thrilled at the sense of discovery\" [1.1 in section\u000a      5]. An evaluation of feedback after the UCL Bloomsbury 3 screening\u000a      highlighted the impacts of the event on the awareness and understanding of\u000a      a quite diverse audience. Sample comments included: `I found the\u000a      introduction [to the film about Caesar] fascinating ... in classes I could\u000a      certainly use the ideas raised' (Classics teacher); `Throughout the\u000a      viewing I was aware that my response was also deepened by your\u000a      presentation, giving a context to the making of the film and its original\u000a      reception in different countries' (entertainment professional\/part-time\u000a      student); `I got talking to the woman next to me, who told me that she's\u000a      not seen many silent films ... exposing people such as this to the\u000a      wonderful world of silent cinema is certainly something to be applauded!'\u000a      (independent filmmaker); and `absolutely amazing evening, extremely\u000a      interesting, clear commentary &amp; wonderful music' (classic film fan)\u000a      [see 1.2 in section 5].\u000a    [2] Contributing to curation, restoration and exhibition of silent\u000a        film as cultural heritage:\u000a\u0009\u0009This research facilitated the work of\u000a      film archivists, curators and programmers in cataloguing, restoring and\u000a      exhibiting silent films set in antiquity. As well as catalysing and\u000a      supporting the exhibition and elucidation of the antiquity films selected\u000a      from the BFI collection (described above), Wyke's research brought wider\u000a      public attention to their significance, enriched the organisation's own\u000a      knowledge of them, and enhanced their cataloguing [see 2.1 in section 5].\u000a    In 2010, Wyke approached a senior programmer at the Bologna Film\u000a      Festival, Il Cinema Ritrovato, one of the world's most important\u000a      festivals for restored films, attracting historians, archivists, fans and\u000a      the general public. Stimulated by the research project [a], and supported\u000a      by further advice from Wyke about film selection, the programmer found the\u000a      confidence to run an antiquity strand in 2011 &#8212; programme 3: `decadenza e\u000a      progresso. verso Quo Vadis?'. Wyke introduced the films and the\u000a      project and, with Michelakis, provided programme notes for the festival\u000a      catalogue. This led to an ongoing partnership: further discussion with\u000a      Wyke motivated the programmer to run another antiquity strand at Bologna\u000a      in July 2013 &#8212; programme 7: `la resurrezione cinematografica, ovvero il\u000a      fascino irresistibile dell'antichit&#224;'. On this occasion (celebrating 100\u000a      years from the release of the significant silent feature, Quo Vadis?),\u000a      Wyke and Michelakis introduced the two-day screenings and led much of the\u000a      discussion at three workshops held on the theme. Wyke's research [a, b]\u000a      stimulated the choice of some of the films screened, featured in a\u000a      considerable part of the two-day discussions, drew in new audiences\u000a      (including classics students from the University of Bologna and the\u000a      curator of antiquities from the local museum), and assisted in the process\u000a      of getting one important feature film, Spartaco ovvero il Gladiatore\u000a        di Tracia (1913), restored specifically for screening at the\u000a      festival [see 2.2 and 2.3 in section 5].\u000a    [3] Enhancing wider public understanding of antiquity in silent and\u000a        sound cinema:\u000a    Wyke's research on both silent and sound films [a, b, c] has achieved\u000a      further impacts (which cross over into public engagement) by promoting\u000a      cultural debate on `antiquity on film'. This was accomplished particularly\u000a      through her role as a `talking head' for a BBC4 Timeshift documentary on Epic:\u000a        A Cast of Thousands (audience figures 254,000 for broadcast on\u000a      24\/12\/2011; 131,000 for 28\/12\/2011; 161,000 for 05\/08\/2012). Wyke also\u000a      contributed to a documentary on the genesis of Biblical films that was\u000a      included in the commercial DVD produced for Warner Brothers Homevideo of Quo\u000a        Vadis (1951) (sales c. 45,000 worldwide), released in 2009. The\u000a      documentary received a rating of 7.5\/10 on the IMDb (Internet Movie\u000a      Database) website, and received a rather better review at DVD Movie Guide\u000a      than Quo Vadis itself, with particular note being made of the\u000a      information provided on the film's silent predecessors [see 3.1 in section\u000a      5].\u000a    Wyke also spoke at literary festivals including Hay (2008 on Julius\u000a      Caesar) and Cheltenham (2010 in conversation with Mary Beard and Kevin\u000a      Macdonald, the director of the epic film The Eagle, during a panel\u000a      on `Swords, sandals &amp; celluloid') [see 3.3 in section 5]. She spoke on\u000a      Newstalk Radio 106 Ulster about the television series Spartacus &#8212;d\u000a        Blood &amp; Sand (2010; audience for the radio show c. 15,000) and\u000a      provided the keynote address at an Oxford schools conference on Classics\u000a      in Film (2008; audience c. 190). She also talked to a public audience\u000a      about the Roman empire on film at a Roman Night at the British Museum in\u000a      association with the Hadrian exhibition (2008) and curated a film season\u000a      in association with its Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition (2013).\u000a    [4] Influencing curriculum development of `antiquity on film' in\u000a        higher education:\u000a    Wyke's research has had a significant impact on the shape and content of\u000a      courses concerning `antiquity on film' or `classical reception' in\u000a      universities in the UK, the USA and Australia. For example, in 2008 she\u000a      was invited to the University of Miami for consultation on teaching film\u000a      in the undergraduate classical curriculum; its Professor of Classics\u000a      refers to the `subtle and well-informed discussions' of the political\u000a      context of the films and explains how her scholarship has influenced his\u000a      `Antiquity through a Lens' course [see 4.1 in section 5].\u000a    Her research [b, c] is also used as course reading in postgraduate and\u000a      undergraduate courses at New Mexico State University, the University of\u000a      Illinois, the University of Exeter and the University of Sydney. Wyke\u000a      organised the digitisation of a selection of silent films from the BFI\u000a      archive (funded by the libraries of UCL and the University of Illinois at\u000a      a cost of &#163;3,363, split 25:75); these have recently been made available\u000a      for research via interlibrary loan. The Professor of Western Civilisation\u000a      &amp; Culture from Illinois writes of the benefits to students enrolled in\u000a      a 2012 course of Wyke's `pioneering' work on the silent era, and states\u000a      that the research itself and the provision of the DVDs for student use has\u000a      created `new horizons' for both him and them. He has also now instated a\u000a      course on the reception of Julius Caesar (launched 2013) in which Wyke's\u000a      research will be required reading [see 4.2 in section 5]. The Chair of\u000a      Classics at the University of Sydney comments that Wyke's work `plays a\u000a      crucial part in our syllabus. Her centrality in the field of reception\u000a      studies demands that our students are familiar with her work' [see 4.3 in\u000a      section 5].\u000a    At the American Philological Association's annual meeting in Seattle in\u000a      January 2013, a special panel was held, sponsored by the American\u000a      Classical League (the main body devoted to the teaching of Latin and Greek\u000a      in the US), in which Wyke's work set the agenda for discussion about new\u000a      research that could be easily incorporated by instructors into their\u000a      curricula. As the Chair in Classics at Sydney remarked, `this session made\u000a      it clear that Wyke represented the benchmark of international best\u000a      practice' [see 4.3 in section 5].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Maria Wyke's research on representations of classical antiquity\u000a      on film has had significant influence on public access to and\u000a      understanding of antiquity in silent cinema, both nationally and\u000a      internationally, through a series of public screenings, film festivals and\u000a      broadcasts.

She joined UCL as Professor of\u000a      Latin in 2005, where she initiated a long-term research project on Ancient\u000a        Civilisations in Silent Cinema (http:\/\/www.ucl.ac.uk\/classics\/research\/research-projects\/CINECIVS)\u000a      with Pantelis Michelakis of the University of Bristol. The project led to\u000a      the publication of an edited collection [a] containing a chapter by Wyke\u000a      on Buster Keaton's comic representation of antiquity and a substantial,\u000a      pioneering introduction on antiquity in silent cinema by Wyke and\u000a      Michelakis. Additionally, her parallel research into the reception of\u000a      Julius Caesar in western culture, supported by an AHRC Research Leave\u000a      Award at UCL (2007), led to the publication of two monographs [b, c] in\u000a      which she discussed extensively Caesar's place in silent Italian and Cold\u000a      War Hollywood cinema. These publications, and the screenings and talks\u000a      based on Wyke and Michelakis' findings, were preceded by substantial\u000a      archival investigations and interviews with archivists in Los Angeles,\u000a      Washington, New York, Amsterdam, Rome and London, particularly between\u000a      2009 and 2011.\u000a    Wyke's individual and collaborative research [especially a] has revealed\u000a      a fascination with antiquity as one of the most distinctive features of\u000a      cinema since its emergence in 1896. More than 400 films set in antiquity\u000a      (from epics to cartoons) survive, alongside screenplays, publicity,\u000a      reviews and other ephemera scattered in archives around the world. Wyke's\u000a      research reveals how silent cinema provided a crucial pathway for\u000a      antiquity to enter modernity and how antiquity provided silent cinema with\u000a      a platform on which to build much of its claim to cultural value. It\u000a      considers: how antiquity films (aesthetically rich, ideologically complex\u000a      and technologically innovative) are situated within silent cinema and in\u000a      relation to later types of filmmaking; the inter-relations between these\u000a      films and other conceptualisations of antiquity in painting, sculpture,\u000a      dance, theatre and opera between 1896 and 1928; the contribution made by\u000a      antiquity to early film (especially in terms of cultural legitimation);\u000a      how antiquity changed on entry into cinema (gaining embodiment, movement,\u000a      colour and music); and what contemporary interests cinema's antiquities\u000a      served (playing out in extremis issues of nationalism, politics, religion,\u000a      class, race, gender and sexuality).\u000a    Wyke's research has included investigations of Julius Caesar in western\u000a      culture more broadly, and in the USA in particular. Representations of\u000a      Caesar in silent and sound cinema are considered in relation to those in\u000a      other popular media (including comic books, television and the popular\u000a      press), and to the specificity of their social, historical and\u000a      technological contexts [b, c]. These examinations of Caesar on film\u000a      demonstrate vividly the ideological roles he has played in later cultures,\u000a      especially in the making of national and political identities. Scholars\u000a      have only recently acknowledged the crucial importance of exploring the\u000a      `democratic turn' in the modern reception of the ancient world; that is,\u000a      the entry of the ancient world into modern mass culture. This research on\u000a      antiquity in cinema therefore makes a vital contribution to the relatively\u000a      new field of `popular' receptions of classical culture.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35194","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6254930","Name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Three projects produced substantial social benefit by enabling an\u000a      expanding network of key participants, organisations and artists to\u000a      promote shared reflection on identity and place among increasingly large\u000a      numbers of members of the public. Two projects were based in Swansea and\u000a      Glasgow, in areas that were among the most deprived in the UK.\u000a    De-Placing Future Memory (2009) [a], brought together an\u000a      interdisciplinary group of academics, along with international artists,\u000a      musicians and curators, some from conflict areas (Palestine and Iraq). It\u000a      engaged over 600 participants, including a workshop with 200 school\u000a      children, and combined artworks, a month-long exhibition, and public\u000a      presentations at the Exeter Caf&#233; Scientifique and Phoenix Arts Centre\u000a      (refs. 1-4).\u000a    The methods explored in this first project were taken forward by Isayev\u000a      with artist Webster and musician Wood in Future Memory in Place\u000a      (2011) [d]. This involved thousands of people in Swansea, including 2700\u000a      pupils from 9 schools (with week-long workshops at each), members of the\u000a      Brunswick Refugee and Asylum `drop-in' centre, Gower College (ESL), and\u000a      the over-55 Art Group at the Glynn Vivian Gallery (refs. 5, 7-8). It\u000a      included the creation of three public art-works in Swansea: (i) a\u000a      sculpture relating to tesserae hospitales, distant friendship\u000a      tokens, housed at the National Waterfront Museum (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1gjmVOW\u000a      ) (ref. 9); (ii) a multi-media event, combining a visual installation, new\u000a      choral composition and film, 1000 Colours Blue, performed live\u000a      with a choir in Swansea City Centre, (http:\/\/bit.ly\/19u9avB\u000a      ); (iii) an exhibition of 800 sent postcards painted by school-children;\u000a      the postcards, and the 1000 Colours Blue have been on exhibition\u000a      in Swansea galleries and in Glasgow Centre of Contemporary Art.\u000a    The third project stemmed from a presentation in Glasgow of the Swansea\u000a      project. This created an opportunity to explore ideas of memory and place\u000a      in conjunction with the Red Road Flats community and Glasgow-based artists\u000a      and academics (Kay, Phipps, Given and Timmermans) [f]. It engaged about\u000a      1000 participants in spring 2013. It included: (i) archaeological and\u000a      sound workshops at St. Martha's Primary School (ref. 10); (ii) story,\u000a      photographic and music workshops with local community groups (ref. 11);\u000a      (iii) a final event including a live choral performance and a soundscape\u000a      created through a 25-storey building (refs. 10-11); (iv) a documentary\u000a      film by Khan, still in the production phase; (v) a forthcoming exhibition\u000a      at the People's Palace, Glasgow of objects and stories created about them\u000a      by school pupils.\u000a    These projects have strengthened links between artists, community groups\u000a      and organisations, with significant impact going beyond the public events\u000a      and workshops just described. For example, University of Glasgow\u000a      archaeologists (e.g. Given) are designing an ongoing programme of outreach\u000a      events, modelled on our workshops. Art students from Swansea Metropolitan\u000a      University who volunteered on our project have set up a community studio\u000a      and art space, and are continuing to work with schools we engaged with\u000a      (e.g. St. Helen's Primary School). We did not aim to explicitly convey\u000a      existing knowledge to a broader public but to enable the many participants\u000a      to use verbal and artistic means to rethink their ideas about space,\u000a      memory and belonging. In particular, we used distance and abstraction\u000a      to promote reflection on highly contested notions in a way that is not\u000a      exclusionary, and avoided conflict about ownership of locations and\u000a      memories.\u000a    Distance from contemporary problems was achieved by highlighting\u000a      analogous ancient themes concerning foreignness, mobility and memory.\u000a      Archaeological objects such as identity markers (used to create the tesserae\u000a        hospitales sculpture), ancient mapping practices based on journeys\u000a      rather than territory, and ancient comedies with numerous characters on\u000a      the move, served as catalysts for wider discussion and activity. E.g.\u000a      after creating a map based on journey stories rather than territory, which\u000a      took up the whole playground, pupils were keen to know, or be associated\u000a      with, people coming from somewhere else. They learnt to accept that\u000a      migration is the norm through history and in our own time and that borders\u000a      are fluid and constructed.\u000a    Regarding abstraction, we developed artistic ways of focusing on\u000a      abstract entities that everyone shares such as the colour blue, while also\u000a      highlighting the multiplicity of what blue is (this became the 1000\u000a        Colours Blue). The combination of the use of archaeological objects\u000a      with creative artistic activity was taken further in Glasgow during the\u000a      archaeological site survey at Red Road Flats. Pupils collected objects\u000a      dispersed when the high-rise flats were recently blown down, and, having\u000a      worked before with ancient archaeological objects, acted like\u000a      archaeologists themselves by creating histories with objects. These\u000a      histories were then translated into colour, by associating specific\u000a      colours with specific emotions. Finally these colours were sung by a\u000a      choir, leading to a public performance that projected these voices and\u000a      sounds, along with stories by ex-residents of all ages and backgrounds,\u000a      from one of the remaining towers. The 25-storey tower, already stripped\u000a      for demolition, was equipped with 10 massive speakers on multiple floors,\u000a      creating one of the largest musical instruments ever played, to a\u000a      community gathering of 500 people on a very rainy day. Seeing and hearing\u000a      the multiplicity of stories that made Red Road Flats the place that it was\u000a      allowed the exposition of multiple narratives and the questioning and\u000a      replacement of the dominantly negative and bleak narrative that had\u000a      entered public consciousness regarding Red Road (as recently as this year,\u000a      the blow down of these `dysfunctional' buildings was widely publicised and\u000a      depicted in the leading media networks). This constituted a unique and\u000a      remarkable cultural event with profound social significance for those\u000a      involved. The documentary film of these events by Khan will take this to a\u000a      wider audience and further an alternative multiple narrative.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr. Elena Isayev has led three projects, drawing on the implications of\u000a      historical research, in collaboration with art practitioners, to engage\u000a      young people, minority and disaffected groups in shared reflection and\u000a      creative activity.

If we recognise\u000a      this fact we can draw powerful analogies with the ancient world and use\u000a      these to question current notions of belonging, `the migrant' and the\u000a      significance of place.\u000a    Isayev's research, focusing on ancient Italy, challenges the prevailing\u000a      view that in the ancient world there was a natural tie to a specific\u000a      homeland and a demographically settled world. She argues that the combined\u000a      evidence of archaeology and literature suggests that much human mobility\u000a      in the last millennium BC was ongoing and cyclical. As a result,\u000a      xenophobia is difficult to identify, and outside the military context `the\u000a      foreigner in our midst' was not seen as a problem. Boundaries of status\u000a      rather than geopolitics were the ones that were difficult to cross. In\u000a      view of the high level of population movement in pre-Imperial Italy,\u000a      Isayev disputes the general assumption that ties to physical territorial\u000a      sites were essential components of individual and collective identities.\u000a      She also stresses the absence from ancient culture of many features, such\u000a      as a rigidly bounded territorial citizenship, that are typical of the\u000a      nation state. These observations allow us to raise broader questions about\u000a      the nature of community membership and `belonging', and to explore the\u000a      implications for contemporary culture and practice. Isayev's recent\u000a      studies [3, 4 and 5] and monograph [6] examine diverse ancient patterns of\u000a      mobility, and chart ancient attitudes towards migrant groups and\u000a      individuals. Isayev joined Exeter in 2002.\u000a    In 2008 and 2011, Isayev was awarded AHRC funding under the Beyond Text\u000a      scheme for two projects, `De-placing Future Memory' [a] and `Future Memory\u000a      in Place' [d], followed by a 3rd project `Future Memory in Red\u000a      Road' in 2012-13, for which funding was raised collaboratively [f]. In\u000a      these projects, Isayev draws out the implications of her work on ancient\u000a      Italy [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6] for contemporary thinking about communal\u000a      identity, place and memory. In particular, De-placing Future Memory looked\u000a      at the transmission of memory across time and space and the way that\u000a      material objects and artistic practice can help us to understand how\u000a      future memory is embodied in places and objects and how this in turn\u000a      affects one's sense of belonging. In particular, her projects showed how\u000a      migrant and displaced people create meaningful memory monuments that\u000a      express their stories and identity. The projects are not explicitly about\u000a      lessons drawn from the past. Rather, the ancient context, by providing\u000a      alternative social and cultural models, has been used as a catalyst in\u000a      collaboration with art and performance practice to stimulate a rethinking\u000a      of fundamental categories such as place, mobility and memory, in a way\u000a      that has led to a new understanding of what it means to belong to a\u000a      community and place.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35200","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impacts during the review period have been achieved by a combination\u000d\u000a      of events or activities\u000d\u000a      targeted at specific interest groups and broader public engagement through\u000d\u000a      lectures and blogs.\u000d\u000a      The aim of both types of activity has been to draw on the insights of the\u000d\u000a      research of the group on\u000d\u000a      ancient medicine or philosophy to promote increased public benefit,\u000d\u000a      especially by contributing to\u000d\u000a      public and professional debate about healthcare and the promotion of\u000d\u000a      physical and psychological\u000d\u000a      wellbeing, and by making a direct contribution to these objectives.\u000d\u000a    (2008): `Plants and Knowledge', a conference organised by Wilkins,\u000d\u000a      focused on the use of plants in\u000d\u000a      ancient and modern medicine, stressing the importance of locating human\u000d\u000a      healthcare and the\u000d\u000a      quest for wellbeing in the context of knowledge and responsible use of the\u000d\u000a      natural environment.\u000d\u000a      The conference brought together academic and non-academic delegates\u000d\u000a      (including\u000d\u000a      representatives from the Eden Project, the National Trust, the Chelsea\u000d\u000a      Physic Garden and the\u000d\u000a      National Science Museum), and attracted over 60 participants including\u000d\u000a      healthcare specialists.\u000d\u000a      This has been followed up by continuing contact with the 6,000-strong\u000d\u000a      British Society of Herbalists,\u000d\u000a      including a paper by Wilkins to the Herbal History Research Network at\u000d\u000a      their 2010 London\u000d\u000a      conference.\u000d\u000a    (2008): Rocca contributed to a Symposium of high-level legal\u000d\u000a      practitioners, including the Leader of\u000d\u000a      the Western Circuit, and medical educators, including a Dean in the\u000d\u000a      Peninsula College of Medicine\u000d\u000a      and Dentistry, on whether there should be a `Hippocratic Oath' for\u000d\u000a      lawyers, paralleling the oath of\u000d\u000a      professional ethics used by doctors.

The\u000d\u000a      Devon and Somerset Law\u000d\u000a      Society adopted this oath as part of the graduation ceremony for\u000d\u000a      solicitors in 2012.\u000d\u000a    (2010-12). Building on the results of the `Balance' conference and\u000d\u000a      workshop (2010, 2011), Wilkins,\u000d\u000a      supported by MA students, especially Patrick Ussher, undertook two\u000d\u000a      initiatives to trial the Galenic\u000d\u000a      lifestyle (based on the idea of `balance' between the six factors outlined\u000d\u000a      in the section on\u000d\u000a      `Underpinning Research') as a means of promoting preventive healthcare\u000d\u000a      under modern\u000d\u000a      conditions. One (2012) was a one-week trial in living a Galenic\u000d\u000a      life-style, followed by 45 people,\u000d\u000a      with positive results posted on the research group blog (`Ancient\u000d\u000a      Healthcare and Modern\u000d\u000a      Wellbeing', ref. 9). Also Wilkins, working with Ussher, has used the\u000d\u000a      Galenic six factors as the basis\u000d\u000a      for five sessions with volunteers in a health charity near Exeter (2012).\u000d\u000a      A follow-up session during\u000d\u000a      the visit of the Chair of the Big Lottery, which funded the workshops,\u000d\u000a      (21\/9\/12) demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      the Galenic principles have been disseminated to other volunteers and to\u000d\u000a      individuals in their care.\u000d\u000a      `He [Chair of the Big Lottery] was extremely impressed by the innovative\u000d\u000a      nature of the project' (ref.\u000d\u000a      3). These UK-based initiatives have been supplemented by a public lecture\u000d\u000a      by Wilkins to GPs,\u000d\u000a      medical historians and others at the Charite medical school in Berlin in\u000d\u000a      2011.\u000d\u000a    (2012): Wilkins conducted two sessions on ancient medicine to 45\u000d\u000a      GCSE History students in a\u000d\u000a      large Academy (Crediton) near Exeter, underlining the potential benefits\u000d\u000a      for healthcare of the\u000d\u000a      Galenic programme. In partnership with two teachers at the school, plans\u000d\u000a      are under way for\u000d\u000a      disseminating materials on the Academy website to all History teachers\u000d\u000a      based on these sessions.\u000d\u000a      `Students enjoyed the process a great deal ...

The project forms an integral\u000d\u000a      part of the University's\u000d\u000a      HASS (Humanities and Social Sciences) strategy, in the Medical Humanities\u000d\u000a      strand. This project\u000d\u000a      has involved four workshops exploring Galenic methods of healthcare with a\u000d\u000a      well-established user-\u000d\u000a      involvement focus group, involving different kinds of people (including\u000d\u000a      Exeter medical students and\u000d\u000a      older patients with chronic conditions). This qualitative data was\u000d\u000a      captured and analysed and this\u000d\u000a      contributed to the design of a questionnaire, which was also informed by\u000d\u000a      advice from the Exeter\u000d\u000a      10,000 steering committee. In April 2013, the questionnaire was launched\u000d\u000a      as a pilot within the\u000d\u000a      Medical School, and then launched on-line and disseminated via the Exeter\u000d\u000a      10,000 data base,\u000d\u000a      inviting people from across Devon to respond. It was also launched within\u000d\u000a      the University, inviting\u000d\u000a      staff and students to answer questions on health and wellbeing based on\u000d\u000a      Galenic principles. The\u000d\u000a      questionnaire was active for 2 months, with 633 people providing\u000d\u000a      information. This covered the full\u000d\u000a      range of factors seen as important by Galen, including food and drink,\u000d\u000a      physical activity, sleep,\u000d\u000a      mental state, home and work environment. The results give a rich and\u000d\u000a      informative picture of\u000d\u000a      current behaviour and attitudes of people in Devon, the areas they see as\u000d\u000a      problematic and the\u000d\u000a      improvements in life-style and management of health they would like to\u000d\u000a      make. The results of the\u000d\u000a      survey have been analysed in a paper co-authored by scholars involved in\u000d\u000a      the project for\u000d\u000a      submission to the International Journal of Wellbeing (copy available). An\u000d\u000a      extension of this work is\u000d\u000a      planned to build on the evidence obtained so far with a view to developing\u000d\u000a      and testing a novel type\u000d\u000a      of complex intervention, designed to take forward the use of Galenic\u000d\u000a      principles in modern\u000d\u000a      communities; the next step is an application for funding for a PhD on this\u000d\u000a      topic, with co-supervision\u000d\u000a      in Classics and the Medical School.\u000d\u000a    This project has taken the exploration of the usefulness of Galenic\u000d\u000a      principles at Exeter to a new\u000d\u000a      level, in terms of institutional support, the involvement of medical\u000d\u000a      experts, and the application of\u000d\u000a      evidence-based methodology to this question. The questionnaire, taken on\u000d\u000a      its own, has brought\u000d\u000a      the attention of a very wide audience to the potential value of ancient\u000d\u000a      healthcare methods.\u000d\u000a    Gill organised an AHRC-funded workshop on Stoic philosophy and\u000d\u000a      psychotherapy in 2012,\u000d\u000a      bringing together academics and therapists. The aim was to build on\u000d\u000a      existing links between Stoic\u000d\u000a      philosophical therapy and modern cognitive psychotherapy, by exploring\u000d\u000a      further ways in which\u000d\u000a      Stoic ideas could enhance modern approaches to promoting psychological\u000d\u000a      wellbeing and to bring\u000d\u000a      these to the attention of a wider audience. The workshop launched a very\u000d\u000a      active network of\u000d\u000a      academics and practitioners, led by Gill and Ussher (now a PhD student).\u000d\u000a      They have organised a\u000d\u000a      one-week trial on living a Stoic life, followed by 150 people. The Stoic\u000d\u000a      trial generated wide\u000d\u000a      international interest, including three UK newspaper articles (ref. 7),\u000d\u000a      and many overseas\u000d\u000a      comments. The network has set up a blog (`Stoicism and its modern uses',\u000d\u000a      ref. 10); this has\u000d\u000a      already had over 74,000 hits with over 3700 views of the video recording\u000d\u000a      the Stoic workshop. A\u000d\u000a      psychotherapist involved in the collaboration, comments: `The \"Stoic Week\"\u000d\u000a      project ... was a huge\u000d\u000a      success &#8212; its popularity surpassed our expectations.

These included a Wellcome-funded\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinary conference on\u000d\u000a      `Balance and Stability in Health and Medicine' (May 2010) and a workshop,\u000d\u000a      funded by the\u000d\u000a      University of Exeter, on `Balance and Healthcare &#8212; Ancient Paradigms and\u000d\u000a      Modern Debates' (May\u000d\u000a      2011). In 2012-13, study of the usefulness of Galenic healthcare methods\u000d\u000a      under modern conditions\u000d\u000a      has been central to a University of Exeter funded interdisciplinary\u000d\u000a      research project involving\u000d\u000a      experts from the Exeter Medical school and Exeter Mood Disorders Centre\u000d\u000a      (see further 4 below on\u000d\u000a      this project).\u000d\u000a    A crucial objective of this research liaison has been to support the work\u000d\u000a      of those in the medical\u000d\u000a      profession arguing that we need a major shift of focus towards preventive\u000d\u000a      medicine, self-care and\u000d\u000a      patient responsibility for health and psychological wellbeing, to help to\u000d\u000a      address the world-wide\u000d\u000a      upsurge in obesity, diabetes, and depression, and a looming crisis in\u000d\u000a      healthcare provision.\u000d\u000a      Members of the group have highlighted features of ancient medical thinking\u000d\u000a      and social practice that\u000d\u000a      offer useful paradigms for approaches to physical and psychological\u000d\u000a      healthcare, stressing\u000d\u000a      prevention and lifestyle management. Key insights include the Galenic idea\u000d\u000a      of a lifestyle based on\u000d\u000a      `balance' between six factors (food and drink, exercise, environment,\u000d\u000a      sleep, mental state,\u000d\u000a      physiological balance), and on methods of enabling patients to bring about\u000d\u000a      this balance for\u000d\u000a      themselves. In ancient psychological healthcare, a related insight,\u000d\u000a      drawing especially on Stoic\u000d\u000a      approaches, is the idea of a programme of individual self-care centred on\u000d\u000a      the goal of agent-based\u000d\u000a      happiness or wellbeing and on practical methods for bringing this about.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35312","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2215636","Name":"Libya"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Bishop and Coulston 2006 (output 2) lies at the heart of the\u000a      impact claimed here. It is regularly consulted by museum staff, media\u000a      companies, artists, and historical re-enactors striving for accurate\u000a      identification and depiction of Roman military equipment. The research\u000a      underlying that work has enabled Coulston to offer advice on these issues\u000a      to a large number of organisations. More broadly, the research underlying\u000a      all five of the listed publications has allowed him to enhance public\u000a      understanding of the Roman army both nationally and internationally, for\u000a      example through his media consultations (including work for North American\u000a      magazine and television companies) and public lectures. These influences\u000a      have been concentrated in three areas.\u000a    i. Heritage management: improvement of museum displays\u000a    A number of UK museums have drawn on Coulston's research, by direct\u000a      consultation and by use of Bishop and Coulston 2006 (output 2), in\u000a      order to improve the classification and public display of their holdings.\u000a      Most importantly, in 2012, Coulston acted as advisor to a restructuring\u000a      project for Housesteads Museum on Hadrian's Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage\u000a      Site. A senior curator for English Heritage writes (source 1): `[After\u000a        initial consultation in person] I commissioned a report [from him] on\u000a        the sculptural and epigraphic material from the site. The project also\u000a        relied heavily on Coulston's earlier work on Roman military fittings\u000a        with Dr Mike Bishop. Coulston's analysis was key to our selection of\u000a        artefacts for display, and in how we chose to interpret them. Beyond the\u000a        rigour of academic description, his willingness to consider the\u000a        circumstances, mechanisms and personal aspects which may have inspired\u000a        the creation of the pieces provided a more personal and intimate\u000a        narrative though which our audiences now access meaning in the\u000a        collection... Dr Coulston's ability to make comparison with other\u000a        assemblages from along the Wall and elsewhere in Britain, and to then\u000a        distill the particular significances and narratives within the site\u000a        collection was essential in giving our interpretation depth, confidence\u000a        and clarity'. Bishop and Coulston 2006 (output 2) has also\u000a      been used regularly by staff in the National Museum of Scotland during\u000a      2008-13 for informing new displays on Roman material, researching newly\u000a      excavated finds and answering public queries. In addition, since 2009\u000a      Coulston has annually presented his study of Roman military equipment\u000a      finds on ancient battlefields at the Conflict Archaeology Short Course\u000a      held jointly by Cranfield University and The Joint Defence Academy of the\u000a      United Kingdom at Shrivenham, a public event attended by numerous heritage\u000a      industry professionals.\u000a    ii. Contributing to the creative sector: consulting work for media\u000a        companies\u000a    Coulston regularly advises media companies seeking to meet the huge\u000a      public demand for material on Roman military and gladiatorial culture.\u000a      During 2008-13 he has helped a range of television and print media\u000a      companies to produce historically accurate representations and\u000a      interpretations. That advice has been underpinned by decades of research\u000a      on the Roman army, and in particular by the five outputs listed above.\u000a      Examples include:\u000a    (a) Consultations and filmed interviews for television\u000a      documentaries on Roman military and gladiatorial subjects during\u000a      2008-2013. i) The Varian Disaster, series Perfect Storms,\u000a      EOne Entertainment, Toronto, for History TC Canada, UK Yesterday and\u000a      National Geographic Channel (filmed interviews, London, May 2012), where\u000a      his contribution focused both on military equipment and on the experience\u000a      of warfare in the forests of Germany, drawing esp. on output 2 and\u000a        output 5. ii) Truth Behind the Film: Gladiator,\u000a      Blinkfilm for National Geographic Channel (filmed interviews, London, June\u000a      2010), where his contribution focused on gladiatorial experience and self-presentation,\u000a\u0009  and on the connections between soldiers and gladiators,\u000a      drawing esp. on outputs 1 and 4. iii) Septimius\u000a        Severus, Lion TV Scotland (filmed interviews, Scotland, Oct. 2009),\u000a      putting Roman warfare in northern Britain into the context of the Roman\u000a      army and military equipment in the wider Roman world, drawing esp. on outputs\u000a        1 and 2.\u000a    (b) Contributions to print media during 2008-2013. i) Ongoing\u000a      consultancy work for the archaeology correspondent of the Independent,\u000a      which has involved lengthy telephone conversations on average three or\u000a      four times per year during 2008-13. Recent consultations have involved\u000a      discussion of new finds of Roman helmets at Hallaton Hill, Leics and\u000a      Crosby Garrett, Cumbria (the latter having been reconstructed and\u000a      auctioned controversially without proper archaeological consultation),\u000a      drawing on Dr Coulston's military equipment specialisation (esp. output\u000a        2); and the Roman cemetery at York (where the evidence of skeletal\u000a      pathology suggests burial of gladiators), drawing on Dr Coulston's\u000a      expertise in gladiatorial culture (esp. output 4). The Independent's\u000a      archaeology correspondent writes (source 2): `My ability to\u000a        communicate new discoveries, new ideas and new thinking to the general\u000a        public is...utterly dependent on the quality of the information I\u000a        receive from the academic world. In the field of Roman military\u000a        archaeology (essential to creating a public understanding of Roman\u000a        Britain and its long-term impact on modern Britain), Jonathan Coulston's\u000a        knowledge, published articles, commitment and advice have been essential\u000a        in enabling me to inform my readers'. ii) Consultant on Roman\u000a      military and gladiatorial equipment for two pictorial reconstructions in National\u000a        Geographic Magazine, drawing especially on outputs 2 and 4\u000a      (`Roman Frontiers', Sept. 2012, 106-27; `New Old Libya', Feb. 2013,\u000a      28-59). A representative of the magazine writes (source 3): `Dr\u000a        Jon Coulston has been instrumental in helping us to create and refine\u000a        artwork developed in conjunction with two...stories... His in-depth\u000a        knowledge of the time period, numerous publications (Roman Military\u000a      Equipment in particular), and keen eye for detail have been invaluable\u000a        to our research staff, editors, and artists. His expertise helped us to\u000a        achieve the standard of excellence and journalistic integrity our\u000a        readers have come to expect from the magazine.' iii) Popular\u000a      magazine interview on aspects of Roman army training, equipment and battle\u000a      by Ben Beaumont-Thomas, `Could you have survived as a Roman soldier?', FHM,\u000a      April 2011, 94-102, drawing esp. on outputs 2, 3 and 5.\u000a      iv) Authored article, `Late Roman Military Equipment: Culture, Arms and\u000a      the Man during the Dominate', Ancient Warfare, Dec. 16, 2012,\u000a      14-19, including collaboration with a commissioned artist to produce a\u000a      historically accurate depiction of Roman military equipment and dress,\u000a      drawing esp. on output 2.\u000a    (c) Production of online material. He has contributed to the BBC\u000a      website The Roman Army with a series of own-copyright images and\u000a      supporting texts which focus on Roman military equipment and iconography\u000a\u0009  (http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/history\/ancient\/romans\/romanarmy_gallery.shtml),\u000a      drawing especially on outputs 1, 2 and 3, and providing\u000a      images for public engagement which would otherwise be difficult to access\u000a      (last updated in 2011).\u000a    iii. Cultural life: enriching the experience of our cultural heritage\u000a    In addition to influencing heritage managers and media companies, the\u000a      research underlying the listed publications has made a major difference to\u000a      wider public understanding of the Roman army.\u000a    Particularly striking is Coulston's influence on Roman army re-enactors,\u000a      modellers, illustrators and amateur historians. Bishop and Coulston 2006 (output\u000a        2) is heavily used by these groups to inform their reconstructions\u000a      of costumes and equipment. The Chair of the late Roman reconstruction\u000a      group Comitatus and of the organisation `Historical\u000a      Interpretations', which provides activity days for school children, writes\u000a      (source 4): `Via \"Historical Interpretations\" Roman days, Jon's\u000a        ideas on the Roman military are taught to roughly 2,000 children each\u000a        year. Comitatus relies heavily on Jon's work... With 50 active members\u000a        Comitatus performs to around 24,000 members of the public each year.\u000a        While the military displays are visually stimulating, the scripted\u000a    commentary carefully describes the equipment on display and the nature\u000a        of the late Roman army. Much of this can be traced to Jon's\u000a        publications... His views on Roman archery and especially the use of\u000a        strung bow cases caused a new approach to be taken within Comitatus, and\u000a        he is the touchstone against which new items of equipment are\u000a        introduced... It is fair to say every re-enactment group uses Jon's work\u000a        to improve their presentation, and this in turn has an impact on the\u000a        heritage industry. Archaeological sites hire Roman re-enactment groups\u000a        to help boost visitor numbers, while cities with a strong Roman\u000a        connection such as Chester and York use costumed guides dressed to help\u000a        tourism. The standard of such off-the-shelf Roman equipment has\u000a        noticeably improved over the past twenty years in part due to Roman\u000a      Military Equipment. Computer and figure war gamers use Jon's work to\u000a        develop figurines and models, while military illustrators base their own\u000a        reconstructions on Jon's work'. One member of the Ermine St Guard\u000a      (Britain's first Roman re-enactment society) writes (source 5): `it\u000a        is fairly safe to say that Bishop and Coulston rank alongside Carol van\u000a        Driel-Murray, Simon James and Mark Hassal as the chief influences on the\u000a        society'. Coulston's work has also had sustained influence on\u000a      authors for the popular history-of-warfare Osprey series (it is cited in\u000a      11 volumes from that series). Graham Sumner, a leading reconstruction\u000a      artist, describes Coulston's influence on his work as an illustrator and\u000a      author for the Osprey series and other popular-history publications (with\u000a      reference among others to Sumner (2008) Roman Military Dress,\u000a      D'Amato (2009) Arms and Armour, and various titles in the `Roman\u000a      Conquest' series for Pen and Sword Books: 4 volumes in 2009-13) (source\u000a        5): `Whenever I am working on a painting dealing with a\u000a        re-construction of a Roman soldier I always as a matter of course refer\u000a        to one if not all of these publications [i.e. Bishop and Coulston 2006,\u000a        and earlier editions] first'. See also source 6 for online\u000a      description of engagement with Bishop and Coulston 2006 in reconstructing\u000a      Roman caligae (boots). Coulston is also a regular contributor to\u000a      the internet forum Roman Army Talk (RAT), an international online\u000a      community of 6,500 Roman army enthusiasts, and regularly draws on his\u000a      research to answer enquiries from non-academic members. He delivered a\u000a      paper (`Arming the Late Roman soldier') at the annual RAT\u000a      conference 2011, in York (audience of 30).\u000a    In addition, Coulston's work has helped to improve understanding of the\u000a      Roman army for members of the wider public with no specialist interest.\u000a      His museum consultations continue to influence the experience of thousands\u000a      of visitors. Housesteads has more than 100,000 visitors per year;\u000a      Segedunum Roman Fort Baths and Museum (where displays on which Coulston\u000a      advised before 2008, helping especially with interpretation of monumental\u000a      sculpture fragments from the site, are still in place, and so have\u000a      continued to have an impact on the experience of visitors during 2008-13)\u000a      has approximately 50,000 visitors per year. The contributions to\u000a      television and print media listed above under 4(ii) have reached a\u000a      wide non-specialist audience. In addition to the consultations listed,\u000a      Coulston made contributions to a number of other television projects\u000a      before 2008 which continue to be syndicated worldwide and to reach a wide\u000a      audience: e.g. Gladiator Graveyard (filmed interviews, London;\u000a      script editor for final cut; originally aired on BBC, Oct. 2007) and The\u000a        Roman Way of War (filmed interviews, London; script editor for final\u000a      cut; originally aired on BBC 1998). National Geographic has a\u000a      global circulation of 8 million, and an estimated monthly readership of 60\u000a      million; FHM had circulation of more than 150,000 in 2011; Ancient\u000a        Warfare has circulation of approximately 10,000. He has also given a\u000a      large number of public talks in museums and schools exploring the place of\u000a      the army in Roman society (underpinned by all five of the outputs in 3\u000a      above), e.g.: i) `A Century of Archaeology in Rome', Kirkcaldy Museum and\u000a      Art Gallery (15 Sept, 2008) (audience of 60); ii) `Trajan's Column: Window\u000a      on the Roman Army?'

Coulston has been a leading figure in that\u000a      development. Since appointment at St Andrews in 1995, his research has\u000a      deepened our understanding of the equipment and appearance of Roman\u000a      soldiers, their self-representation in visual media, and their treatment\u000a      by other communities in the Roman world. His work is based on comparative\u000a      study of (i) equipment artefacts archaeologically recovered from Roman\u000a      military contexts, and (ii) representations of and by soldiers from across\u000a      the territory of the former Roman empire. Key outputs include:\u000a    (a) The second edition of Bishop and Coulston, Roman Military\u000a        Equipment (output 2). Internationally recognised as the\u000a      authority in the field, it is indispensable for anyone interested in the\u000a      Roman army. The book surveys the appearance and function of the full range\u000a      of military equipment items and draws new conclusions about the evolution\u000a      of Roman military equipment and the social status of the Roman soldier.\u000a      The second edition (2006, 1200 items in the bibliography) involved\u000a      large-scale expansion and revision from the first (1993, 700 items), in\u000a      order to take account of new developments in many areas of the field.\u000a    (b) Studies of representations of Roman soldiers in metropolitan Rome:\u000a      esp. Coulston 2000 (output 1) which engages with the 2,662 human\u000a      figures and 542 items of spoliated equipment on Trajan's Column in Rome\u000a      (facilitated by access to scaffolding covering the monuments) and offers\u000a      new arguments about the significance of those images for our understanding\u000a      of the Roman army.\u000a    (c) Studies of the self-representation of military communities. Coulston\u000a      2007 (output 3) analyses 750 surviving figural gravestones from\u000a      across the Roman world which depict Roman soldiers as they wished to be\u000a      remembered. Coulston 2013 (output 5) explores perceptions of\u000a      courage and cowardice by serving soldiers and veterans, and sheds new\u000a      light on the ancient evidence by comparing it with post-classical military\u000a      cultures.\u000a    (d) A study of the self-representation of gladiators: Coulston 2009 (output\u000a        4) offers new arguments for the differences between gladiators and\u000a      soldiers, but also especially for similarities in their techniques of\u000a      self-representation: gladiators are often depicted in similar form to\u000a      soldiers and in many of the same media, especially figural gravestones,\u000a      despite the fact that they had much lower status.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35313","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2629691","Name":"Iceland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dr Sweetman's research on the Sparta Basilica, part of a larger project\u000a      on the churches of the late-antique\u000a      Peloponnese, involved a virtual reconstruction of the basilica complex.\u000a      That was\u000a      developed together with a pair of publications on the pedagogical\u000a      applications of virtual\u000a      reconstruction. It was funded by an HEA grant of &#163;3000. That work then\u000a      made possible the\u000a      development of a series of other virtual reconstructions by a team in the\u000a      School of Computer\u000a      Science working in consultation with Dr Sweetman and other colleagues in\u000a      St Andrews. The next\u000a      reconstruction after the Sparta Basilica was St Andrews Cathedral (static\u000a      page at\u000a      https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71629823).\u000a      Following a demonstration of the Cathedral reconstruction to Historic\u000a      Scotland, the team was commissioned to complete a reconstruction of\u000a      Linlithgow palace (which\u000a      had been started and abandoned by a commercial company). Two further\u000a      reconstructions were\u000a      then completed independently by the project team in Computer Science\u000a      (Martyrs' Church, St\u000a      Andrews, and 1920s Harlem), and a further five in collaboration with SCAPE\u000a      Trust, which aims to\u000a      research, preserve and promote the archaeology of Scotland's coast (the\u000a      Trust is affiliated with\u000a      and partly funded by the University of St Andrews), and with a series of\u000a      museums both in Scotland\u000a      and in Iceland. Those five are: the Brora Salt Pans and a medieval\u000a      settlement in Caen in\u000a      Sutherland, both on display in Timespan Museum and Arts Centre in\u000a      Helmsdale, Sutherland; the\u000a      sixteenth-century fort at Eyemouth, to be displayed in Eyemouth Museum;\u000a      the Fethaland Fishing\u000a      Station, to be displayed in the Shetland Museum; and a\u000a      tenth-century Icelandic Viking longhouse\u000a      in the Mosfell Valley. The reconstructions are available online (http:\/\/openvirtualworlds.org\/start\/).\u000aThese\u000a      reconstructions have begun to make a substantial contribution to heritage\u000a      management,\u000a      public understanding and educational practice, in Scotland and beyond.\u000a    i. Heritage management and public understanding of Scottish and\u000a        classical history\u000a      The initial benefit of this work has been to heritage managers working in\u000a      Scotland and beyond. The\u000a      work on Linlithgow Palace was supported by a &#163;3000 grant from Historic\u000a      Scotland (in addition to a\u000a      further grant from Education Scotland noted in section ii, below) in\u000a      recognition of its importance as\u000a      a model for the future accessibility agenda of Scottish tourism more\u000a      broadly. The value of this work\u000a      for preserving community heritage has been recognised through funding\u000a      given by the Heritage\u000a      Lottery fund (&#163;60,000), MakeITHappen (&#163;17,000), and Historic Scotland\u000a      (&#163;10,000), allocated in\u000a      order to give the reconstructions permanent exhibition space in the\u000a      museums noted above. Dr\u000a      Sweetman's initial research on the Sparta Basilica, with its innovative\u000a      use of virtual reconstruction,\u000a      and the subsequent extension of those techniques to other sites have thus\u000a      benefited heritage\u000a      managers in a range of institutions, helping them to further their goals\u000a      of increasing accessibility to\u000a      local archaeological material. That work has also helped stimulate wider\u000a      dialogue about the future\u000a      directions of digital heritage management beyond the sites named above\u000a      through being exhibited\u000a      at the DigiDoc 2012 conference (a Historic Scotland event) to a mixed\u000a      audience (160) including\u000a      heritage managers.\u000a    Since completion, the reconstructions have also begun to make significant\u000a      contributions to\u000a      enhancing public understanding of the archaeological sites in question\u000a      among local communities\u000a      and tourists. One striking development is the way in which the use of\u000a      gaming platforms in the\u000a      reconstructions (which can be accessed via game controllers and natural\u000a      movement) has\u000a      encouraged more enthusiastic engagement with local heritage from younger\u000a      visitors. The\u000a      Timespan museum in Sutherland writes (source 1): `In Timespan,\u000a        we have been looking for ways\u000a        to attract new audiences to learn about our heritage, which can be\u000a        considered by some as a bit dry\u000a        and dusty and just for the older folk. Here we have up to date\u000a        technology that children and young\u000a        adults are familiar with, regularly use and work with, so bringing our\u000a        heritage fully into the 21st\u000a      century...' According to Timespan, the availability of the\u000a      Longhouse reconstruction on their website\u000a      from June 2013 has contributed to an increase in traffic, with a 21%\u000a      increase in visitors during the\u000a      first month (2489 in June, from 2059 in May), an increase in average\u000a      session time from 2 to 4\u000a      minutes, and an increase from 38% to 59% in returning visitors. Members of\u000a      the project held a\u000a      public event to launch the Caen reconstruction at the Timespan Museum in\u000a      May 2013: 100% of\u000a      those who filled in questionnaires (source 6) agreed or strongly\u000a      agreed with the statements `The\u000a      exhibit helped me imagine what it would have been like to live in Caen'\u000a      and `I would now like to find\u000a      out more about life in the Highlands'. The launch was covered in one local\u000a      newspaper (the John\u000a        O'Groat Journal and Caithness Courier, 5\/6\/13) and two national ones\u000a      (The Herald, 28\/5\/13, and\u000a      The Scotsman, 25\/5\/13). In addition, the reconstructions have\u000a      reached a wide public audience\u000a      through a series of one-off events for mixed audiences of children and\u000a      adults: MUSA museum, St\u000a      Andrews (January 2012, 60 visitors); Dundee Science Centre (March 2012,\u000a      1000 visitors); `Food\u000a      for Thought', St Andrews (June 2012, 800 visitors); `Across the Universe',\u000a      St Andrews (June 2013,\u000a      450 visitors); likewise through presentations at five non-academic\u000a      community archaeology\u000a      conferences in 2012: Highland Archaeology Fortnight; Tayside and Fife\u000a      Archaeology; Scotland\u000a      Community Heritage; East Lothian &amp; Borders Archaeology; Dunkeld\u000a      Community Archaeology. At\u000a      all these events the reconstructions have been made available to visitors\u000a      for trial. Visitor-book\u000a      comments from all these events were unanimously positive. Many suggested\u000a      that the experience\u000a      had contributed to revising their perception of the sites, and many\u000a      expressed a desire to follow up\u000a      the experience by visiting the sites or by connecting to the\u000a      reconstructions from home. Typical\u000a      comments include: `Kids were very interested and enjoyed being able to\u000a        interact with the cathedral.\u000a        The controllers...made it easy for them to do this'; `Fantastic\u000a        work. Can't wait to visit St Andrews\u000a        again to look at the cathedral ruins' (from Dundee Science Centre, source\u000a        7) and `A fantastic\u000a        learning tool and great fun to use' (from Food for Thought, source\u000a        8). Wider dissemination has\u000a      been achieved through local BBC and STV news coverage, following up on the\u000a      Food for Thought\u000a      event mentioned above (24\/6\/12), and through articles about the online\u000a      launch of the cathedral\u000a      reconstruction in both the Dundee Courier and the St Andrews Citizen\u000a      in July 2012 (source 9: `A\u000a      virtual time machine has been officially unveiled in St Andrews, allowing\u000a      the exciting opportunity to\u000a      explore the town's cathedral...[It is] intended to give users a new\u000a      perspective on Scottish history,\u000a      accessible across the generations'). The project websites had received\u000a      over 12,000 page views by\u000a      31\/7\/13, the Facebook page had 400 friends and had achieved a peak weekly\u000a      reach of 8000.\u000a    ii. Education\u000a      The reconstructions have also begun to be used widely in Scottish schools.\u000a      Education Scotland\u000a      collaborated with Historic Scotland in their support for the Linlithgow\u000a      Palace reconstruction (see\u000a      above) by a grant of &#163;2450 in March 2012. The Linlithgow Palace and St\u000a      Andrews Cathedral\u000a      reconstructions are hosted on the refurbished Education Scotland `Glow'\u000a      website which makes\u000a      them available as resources for all schools in Scotland. The Glow website\u000a      is central to Education\u000a      Scotland's initiative on game-based learning within the Curriculum for\u000a      Excellence (CfE). A\u000a      representative of Education Scotland writes (source 2): `We...see\u000a        this work as something that can\u000a        underpin a widening of interest in the historical tapestry of Scottish\u000a        schools and this experience\u000a        has helped raise the bar of aspiration for us...so much that we are now\u000a        looking to develop national\u000a        challenges that would see learners recreate [other] historical\u000a        sites...using tools such as Google\u000a        Sketchup or even Minecraft. Over the past few years the Emerging\u000a        Technologies Team [at\u000a        Education Scotland] has gained a lot of recognition for its innovative\u000a        use of digital technologies to\u000a        enhance and enrich learning...The partnership of the team at St Andrews\u000a        University has been\u000a        invaluable in helping us maintain our presence in this domain and\u000a        without it we would have ended\u000a        this avenue of enquiry some time ago'.\u000a    The first three reconstructions (Sparta Basilica, St Andrews Cathedral,\u000a      and Linlithgow Palace)\u000a      have been used in seven schools (Linlithgow PS, Linlithgow Academy, Madras\u000a      College,\u000a      Strathkinness PS, Dundee High School, Glenrothes High School, Helmsdale\u000a      PS) in classes and\u000a      projects. For example, the Cathedral reconstruction was used as the basis\u000a      for developing a Local\u000a      Unit of the CfE at secondary level at Madras College, St Andrews, in\u000a      2012-13. It was launched in\u000a      October\/November 2012 via a three-day event at the school, attended by 400\u000a      students, which\u000a      included talks and hands-on experience. Students then visited the\u000a      Cathedral ruins and completed\u000a      assessment projects based on the reconstructions. A representative of\u000a      Madras College writes\u000a      (source 3): `Rebecca's reconstruction had a positive impact on\u000a        pupils, teaching staff and the wider\u000a        community...The quality and quantity of work students have been doing in\u000a        their own time speaks of\u000a        how the Cathedral reconstruction has fired their imagination. I haven't\u000a        known anything like it\u000a        before'. The reconstructions are attractive to teachers because\u000a      learners are empowered by using\u000a      familiar technology, and because they are accessible to a range of age\u000a      groups and to students with\u000a      different learning requirements. A representative of the Department of\u000a      Additional Support at\u000a      Glenrothes High School writes (in reference to his first experience of the\u000a      reconstructions while still\u000a      at Madras College) (source 4): `I took a group of DAS pupils in\u000a        to see the material and was struck\u000a        at how engaged they were with the format. Many of these children with a\u000a        range of moderate\u000a        learning difficulties spend many hours on x-box and playstation so the\u000a        controls were recognisable\u000a        and posed far less threat than a pencil and paper...The pupils engaged\u000a        fully with the activity, and\u000a        the arrangement allowed for co-operative learning, good communication,\u000a        and was fun'. That initial\u000a      experience led him to invite the project team to engage in further\u000a      collaboration after he moved to\u000a      Glenrothes. The team spent two days there working with 40 students with\u000a      learning difficulties in\u000a      June 2013. The DAS has agreed to be involved in a pilot project trialling\u000a      the use of the\u000a      reconstructions for its pupils during 2013-14. A representative from the\u000a      High School of Dundee\u000a      writes (source 5) about a recent visit by Dr Sweetman: `The\u000a        virtual simulations engendered\u000a        discussions about how people would have behaved and felt, encouraging\u000a        pupils to approach their\u000a        studies with empathy and therefore a clearer understanding of their\u000a        forebears' motivation and\u000a        decision making...This year I have a group of boys who often appear\u000a        disengaged from their topic\u000a        studies and, perhaps understandably, would rather play football or\u000a        computer games. Allowing them\u000a        the opportunity to combine their love of games technology and their\u000a        studies is a perfect solution...It\u000a        was pleasing to see their increased involvement with the content of the\u000a        lesson...The pupils could\u000a        better see the purpose of archaeological research with such a vivid and\u000a        visual method of\u000a        presenting them with the information'. The reconstructions have also\u000a      been used outside class\u000a      teaching and project assignments. For example, 200 school students from\u000a      Linlithgow Academy\u000a      were involved in an event in June 2012, organised in collaboration with\u000a      Education Scotland. They\u000a      were filmed acting as tour guides in 16th-century costume and\u000a      placed within the Linlithgow\u000a      reconstruction using green-screen technology (http:\/\/vimeo.com\/71629822).\u000a      The project has also\u000a      contributed to dialogue about future directions for virtual reconstruction\u000a      in education through\u000a      presentations at two major educational conferences: the Scottish\u000a      Association of Teachers of\u000a      History Conference (audience of 160) and IED Immersive Education, Paris\u000a      (60).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Sweetman's research on the churches of the late-antique Peloponnese\u000a      included a virtual\u000a      reconstruction of the Acropolis Basilica in Sparta, which was developed in\u000a      conjunction with a pair\u000a      of publications on the pedagogical applications of virtual\u000a      reconstructions. This initial work led to the\u000a      development of nine other virtual reconstructions &#8212; including St Andrews\u000a      Cathedral, Linlithgow\u000a      Palace and the Brora Salt Pans in Sutherland &#8212; which have contributed to\u000a      making cultural heritage\u000a      more accessible to a wide range of users. Specifically:\u000a    i.

It has also advanced our understanding of the\u000a      pedagogical value of\u000a      virtual reconstructions.\u000a    (i) Since arriving at the University of St Andrews in 2003 much of\u000a      Dr Sweetman's work has\u000a      focused on the functions of architectural space and the use of\u000a      architecture and topography in the\u000a      Christianization process in the Peloponnese. Central to that research was\u000a      a virtual, three-dimensional\u000a      reconstruction of the sixth-century phase of the Sparta basilica complex,\u000a      based on her\u000a      excavations (output 1). It was created jointly with Dr Alan Miller,\u000a      Lecturer in Computer Science in\u000a      St Andrews, and subsequently made available online (output 2). The\u000a      virtual reconstruction allowed\u000a      Dr Sweetman to test a series of hypotheses about the architectural layout\u000a      and functions of the\u000a      building. Being able to experience the reconstructed space virtually led\u000a      to an improved understanding\u000a      of lines of sight within the building and their likely significance for\u000a      social stratification, and of the\u000a      likely organisation of space for liturgical practices. Key findings (outputs\u000a        3 and 4) include: the\u000a      probability of a domed roof for the Basilica over the Bema as early as the\u000a      late antique period; new\u000a      insights into how the West building and church were connected with each\u000a      other, which in turn\u000a      made it possible to identify the likely presence of upper galleries; new\u000a      understanding of the way in\u000a      which the West building's stairs functioned as a viewing platform, which\u000a      strengthens the arguments\u000a      for a martyr's tomb; the conclusion that the liturgy practised in the\u000a      building is lkely to have had a\u000a      focus on procession; the conclusion that some aspects of the building were\u000a      designed to be socially\u000a      exclusive (through access and lines of sight), which is a typical feature\u000a      of the late-antique\u000a      Christianization process.\u000a    (ii) A secondary strand of research into pedagogical applications\u000a      of learning through virtual\u000a      reconstructions was conducted in collaboration with the School of Computer\u000a      Science (outputs 5\u000a      and 6). Most importantly, Allison et al. (2010) (output 6)\u000a      explored educational applications of the\u000a      virtual platform outside academic research. Sweetman's contributions\u000a      focused on the use of virtual\u000a      platforms in teaching archaeology. She found that these platforms improve\u000a      the learning experience\u000a      of pupils and students in Classics, History and Archaeology. The research\u000a      also reached some\u000a      preliminary conclusions about the way in which virtual experience of the\u000a      architecture and space of\u000a      archaeological sites, especially when integrated with a game concept, can\u000a      allow tourists and\u000a      students to gain a richer understanding of locations which are\u000a      geographically remote or no longer\u000a      in existence in their original form.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35575","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Digital Classics builds capacity in heritage organisations, enhances\u000a      school curricula, establishes\u000a      best practice, and develops web infrastructure.\u000a    Hestia's experimentation with data visualisation has attracted the\u000a      interest of cultural heritage\u000a      groups and government agencies who need to present big and often messy\u000a      data in ways that\u000a      make sense to users while neither reducing complexity nor presenting a\u000a      misleading picture.\u000a      English Heritage, Ordnance Survey and Hampshire County Council all\u000a      participated in the Hestia2\u000a      July 2013 workshop on using network visualisations to analyse spatial\u000a      relationships in data\u000a      records.\u000a    Hestia's `outreach' potential in using different web-mapping technologies\u000a      for reading texts visually\u000a      has been documented in two outreach publications (in Amphora, the\u000a      American Philological\u000a      Association outreach magazine, and Iris schools magazine).

It was also one of four\u000a      examples chosen by Google\u000a      to be showcased at its June 2012 Geo Teachers Institute in London. GAP has\u000a      contributed to the\u000a      Amicus Brief compiled by digital humanities scholars and law professors\u000a      and submitted in support\u000a      of the defendants in the Authors Guild vs. HathiTrust case of the US\u000a      Southern District Court of\u000a      New York (5). Citing this brief, the trial court ruling found that certain\u000a      uses of digitised university\u000a      library books to enhance search, scholarship, and access qualify as fair\u000a      use, a ruling that\u000a      dramatically impacts and enables the future of this work.\u000a    Going beyond establishing best practice, Pelagios has been\u000a      developing ancient-world web\u000a      infrastructure for academic and non-academic data providers alike and has\u000a      impact beyond ancient\u000a      world data. For example JISC identifies Pelagios's decentralised, open\u000a      annotation approach as a\u000a      model for future web practice, featuring it in the policy document\u000a      `Preliminary highlights from the\u000a      JISC Discovery programme' (6). This sets out the plan for future\u000a      investment in digital infrastructure\u000a      projects, as an example of `greater impact through linking'.\u000a    The open-data service technology that Pelagios has championed is now the\u000a      de facto international\u000a      standard for open linked geospatial data concerning the ancient world.\u000a      Impact is measured not just\u000a      by the growing number of partners whom Pelagios has attracted but also by\u000a      the process that each\u000a      group undertakes to become a partner: by adopting the Pelagios system,\u000a      partner organisations\u000a      must change the way they structure their data. This means that Pelagios's\u000a      research has achieved\u000a      the impact of transforming the nature of the data held and provided by all\u000a      of these organisations,\u000a      and the way in which they work and even conceptualise their activity.\u000a    In addition to work with the British Library (7) the spectrum of\u000a      organisations extends beyond the\u000a      academic research community to include: regional and national museums\u000a      (e.g. the Ure Museum,\u000a      the British Museum); a national database (Arachne); a private learned\u000a      society (Nomisma), a digital\u000a      library (Perseus); an aggregator service (CLAROS); the government-funded\u000a      Portable Antiquities\u000a      Scheme (including meetings with staff from the British Museum and\u000a      presentations at the Linked\u000a      Ancient World Data Institute seminar series in New York (8)); and an\u000a      equally diverse array of\u000a      voluntary partners and interest groups (Ports Antiques; Regnum Francorum\u000a      Online; SquinchPix;\u000a      the open-access Ancient History Encyclopedia (9)). Pelagios was the\u000a      subject of a keynote\u000a      presentation at a meeting of Wikipedia in Germany, for bringing together\u000a      scholarly research and\u000a      public resources (10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Digital Classics research group has been instrumental in transforming\u000a      the cultural capital of\u000a      the ancient world online, through changing the way that information about\u000a      the ancient world is\u000a      found and can be used.

Work focuses primarily on three\u000a      ongoing projects.\u000a    Hestia uses an innovative methodology for studying the spatial\u000a      relations embedded within a\u000a      literary text. It was initially funded in 2008-10 by the AHRC, with\u000a      follow-on funding awarded from\u000a      2013. With Herodotus's Histories as the test case, the team uses\u000a      digital technology and develops\u000a      web-mapping tools, replacing the usual cartographic representations of\u000a      space as points on a map\u000a      with an understanding of space as a contact zone of connections between\u000a      places and peoples.\u000a    Hestia's experimental approach uses:\u000a    \u000a      Geographical Information Systems (GIS), through which users can query\u000a        and map all the spatial\u000a        data in the text;\u000a      Google Earth, which allows users to locate and find out about places\u000a        mentioned in Herodotus;\u000a       a narrative timeline showing places appearing and `fading from\u000a        memory' as the `reader' moves\u000a        through the text or along a `timeline' of book chapters.\u000a    \u000a    All data and maps generated are open so interested users, including\u000a      schools, can find out about\u000a      Herodotus's world for themselves. Our technologies have considerable reuse\u000a      potential in other\u000a      humanities\/social sciences disciplines.\u000a    GAP builds on Hestia by developing the means of automatically\u000a      finding places not just in a single\u000a      text but, in principle, in any text across large text corpora (e.g. Google\u000a      Books). It then visualises the\u000a      results. It has been funded successively from 2011 under Google's Digital\u000a      Humanities Research\u000a      Awards.\u000a    Using the ancient world as a test case, GAP addresses two primary\u000a      concerns related to online\u000a      resources: discoverability and usability. Our specialist software tools\u000a      identify what places are\u000a      mentioned where, and how often, within a given text, and then resolve\u000a      those results to a digital\u000a      gazetteer, displaying their locations on a map. We have developed an\u000a      intuitive reading interface\u000a      called GapVis, where users can see at a glance the total distribution of\u000a      place references. They can\u000a      also move through the narrative and see locations appearing and `fading\u000a      from memory', and focus\u000a      on individual places including their relationships to other locations\u000a      mentioned `in the same breath'.\u000a      GapVis is freely available online and extensible to any narrative with\u000a      geospatial content.\u000a    Funded by successive JISC programmes, Pelagios develops the\u000a      infrastructure through which\u000a      online material about the ancient world can be brought together. By\u000a      developing a common schema\u000a      and providing community guidelines for referring to place data, whether\u000a      archaeological, literary or\u000a      visual, Pelagios enables people or groups (whether academic or\u000a      not) to join the network, making\u000a      their own resources more discoverable and, therefore, more valuable. In\u000a      turn, the Pelagios\u000a      network empowers both professionals and the general enthusiast to discover\u000a      the cities of antiquity\u000a      and explore the rich interconnections between them.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35578","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our research in Classical Receptions contributes to the arts and cultural\u000d\u000a      sectors in the UK and abroad, providing platforms for practitioners to\u000d\u000a      explore the relationship between their work and classical texts.

For example, Hardwick was overseas consultant to\u000d\u000a      the Australian academic and theatre `Linkage' project (Monash\u000d\u000a      University\/Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne, funded by Australian Research\u000d\u000a      Council).\u000d\u000a    In this cycle, Robson's research on Aristophanes led to a 2012-2013\u000d\u000a      project making a series of 6 audios and 5 videos, `Birth of Comedy',\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the OU and produced by an external production company [1].\u000d\u000a      Three of these videos feature two professional actors, acting out three\u000d\u000a      scenes from Aristophanic comedy translated by Robson; the audios, written\u000d\u000a      and presented by Robson, include interviews with academics and\u000d\u000a      practitioners. The materials are available on open access. In 2012 Robson\u000d\u000a      took part in a public discussion at the Witte de With Art Gallery,\u000d\u000a      Rotterdam with the artist in residence, Alexandre Singh, designed to feed\u000d\u000a      into Singh's Aristophanes-inspired project, `The Humans', modelled on the\u000d\u000a      plays of Aristophanes. This discussion will develop the piece for a\u000d\u000a      further presentation in Autumn 2013 [2].\u000d\u000a    Swift's research on the role of the chorus has led to work with the\u000d\u000a      directors and casts of theatre productions, in particular the National\u000d\u000a      Theatre's (NT) Antigone, and subsequently to external funding to\u000d\u000a      develop a play based on fragments of ancient drama. She features in three\u000d\u000a      National Theatre YouTube videos introducing ancient theatre, aimed at\u000d\u000a      schools (17,082, 5,976 and 2,887 views since their launch in January-March\u000d\u000a      2013) [3].\u000d\u000a    The Classical Receptions group also engages and influences practitioners\u000d\u000a      in the creative industries through the e-journal Practitioners' Voices\u000d\u000a        in Classical Reception Studies (ed. Dr Jessica Hughes, since 2007).\u000d\u000a      The journal provides a forum in which theatre directors, designers,\u000d\u000a      dramaturges, actors, poets, translators and artists involved in the\u000d\u000a      creative practices that are so crucial to Classical Receptions can discuss\u000d\u000a      the relationship between their work and the classical texts, themes and\u000d\u000a      contexts on which they draw. Artists featured, such as Marian Maguire and\u000d\u000a      Craig Hamilton, then link to their work for the journal on their websites\u000d\u000a      [4].\u000d\u000a    Our view of `practitioners' is a broad one. King, a Visiting Professor at\u000d\u000a      the Peninsula Medical School in Truro for the past 6 years, teaches\u000d\u000a      medical students the history of dissection, helping them to develop a\u000d\u000a      historical perspective to a practice which is not part of their core\u000d\u000a      curriculum. Having published on Classical Receptions in the history of\u000d\u000a      midwifery, she also works with practising midwives and from 2011 has been\u000d\u000a      on the steering group of the mostly practitioner-based De Partu\u000d\u000a      History of Childbirth group, where her role is to act as a bridge between\u000d\u000a      the practitioner and academic communities.\u000d\u000a    Cultural impact\u000d\u000a    Supported by OU media training, the work of the Classical Receptions\u000d\u000a      group has enhanced the provision of key public institutions within the\u000d\u000a      creative economy; for example, giving pre-performance talks and working\u000d\u000a      with museums and galleries to facilitate public understanding of the\u000d\u000a      classical inheritance of plays, artefacts and broader cultural\u000d\u000a      institutions.\u000d\u000a    Swift wrote programme notes (NT Antigone, 2012; English National\u000d\u000a      Orchestra Medea, 2013), while Robson gave pre-performance talks on\u000d\u000a      Clouds (2009) and Lysistrata (2011). King's research led to\u000d\u000a      her involvement in the exhibition Leonardo da Vinci: Anatomist at\u000d\u000a      the Queen's Gallery in 2012, which was the most successful exhibition in\u000d\u000a      the history of the Gallery (148,299 visitors). King features in the app\u000d\u000a      (which sold 12,821 copies by the end of July 2013), lecture programme and\u000d\u000a      audio guide, and the follow-up exhibition at Holyroodhouse [5]. She also\u000d\u000a      discussed Titian's `Diana and Callisto' as reception in a National Gallery\u000d\u000a      podcast on the `Metamorphosis' exhibition (2012), supporting this with a\u000d\u000a      blog post [6]. She discussed the classical history of hysteria in a\u000d\u000a      concert interval piece for Radio 3 (2012). Paul worked on the extra\u000d\u000a      materials for the blu-ray release of Oliver Stone's `Alexander', and King\u000d\u000a      and Professor Phil Perkins were featured on Radio 4, `In our Time' (2011,\u000d\u000a      2012, 2013).\u000d\u000a    Our contributions extend beyond interviews to research-led podcasts for\u000d\u000a      public consumption. The Classics Confidential vodcast website (over 50,000\u000d\u000a      visits), established in 2011 and run by Hughes and Dr Elton Barker,\u000d\u000a      engages the general public with behind-the-scenes view of the research (or\u000d\u000a      artistic creation) undertaken by scholars and practitioners from the\u000d\u000a      classics community both here and abroad [7]. User profiles of the 350+\u000d\u000a      members of its Facebook group and of the 1800+ Twitter followers indicate\u000d\u000a      interest from general enthusiasts for Classical Studies from outside the\u000d\u000a      academy. In 2010 James developed podcasts from her research on\u000d\u000a      artificially constructed women from Ovid's Pygmalion to Buffy\u000d\u000a        the Vampire Slayer; these have had over 90,000 downloads [8].\u000d\u000a    Teaching\u000d\u000a    We engage other universities and students with our research as users of\u000d\u000a      the Classical Receptions in Late Twentieth Century Drama and Poetry in\u000d\u000a        English Project [9], and through our staffing and hosting the\u000d\u000a      website for the Classical Reception Studies Network (CRSN),\u000d\u000a      established by Professor Lorna Hardwick in 2004 [10]. CRSN encourages\u000d\u000a      collaboration across institutional, national and sector boundaries,\u000d\u000a      fostering cross-disciplinary exchanges of research and teaching by\u000d\u000a      promoting rigorous debate about classical reception studies. At the census\u000d\u000a      date, CRSN had 57 institutional members and 89 individual members\u000d\u000a      worldwide; 33 institutional members are outside the UK, including 12 in\u000d\u000a      the USA, one in Brazil and two in Africa. Not all are universities; the\u000d\u000a      USA members include Shaker Heights High School. Currently King is\u000d\u000a      co-chair, Bakogianni (2009-present) &#8212; formerly a post-doctoral OU-funded\u000d\u000a      researcher on Classical Receptions in Drama and Poetry &#8212; is\u000d\u000a      administrator, and Paul and Hughes (2008-present) lead the teaching and\u000d\u000a      communications strands respectively.\u000d\u000a    CRSN's mission includes a commitment to training students from UK\u000d\u000a      universities. At least one workshop a year is run for UK postgraduate\u000d\u000a      students, recently covering teaching Classical Receptions (2012), and\u000d\u000a      Classical Receptions and the job market (2013). Alongside a full archive\u000d\u000a      of a series of open e-seminars and international conferences, the CRSN\u000d\u000a      website includes materials aimed at those beginning to teach in the field.\u000d\u000a      Many CS staff address school audiences; Robson's work on Aristophanes has\u000d\u000a      included speaking to 600 students at the Bryanston summer school (July\u000d\u000a      2013) on Lysistrata. CRSN organised panels on teaching classical\u000d\u000a      reception studies at the 2012 Higher Education Academy conference and at\u000d\u000a      the 2013 American Philological Association conference.\u000d\u000a    CRSN tweets (@CRSN_UK; over 600 followers including many general\u000d\u000a      enthusiasts).

Our research analyses\u000d\u000a      changing and creative responses to classical texts in a range of fields of\u000d\u000a      modern culture. Professor Lorna Hardwick (OU 1976-2011; subsequently\u000d\u000a      Professor Emerita) has a strong international and facilitating presence as\u000d\u000a      journal editor (Classical Receptions Journal, launched 2009), book\u000d\u000a      series co-editor (Classical Presences, OUP &#8212; 64 titles published\u000d\u000a      since 2005) and Companion co-editor (Blackwell Companion to Classical\u000d\u000a        Receptions, 2008). Her own research shows how ancient Greek drama\u000d\u000a      and poetry, in particular, have been contested texts in modern culture and\u000d\u000a      politics, including postcolonial societies. Ancient sources provide not a\u000d\u000a      static `tradition' but a rich source for debates about identity [1]. Her\u000d\u000a      work further demonstrates how studying receptions raises new questions\u000d\u000a      about the original `source' texts and suggests fresh interpretations of\u000d\u000a      them.\u000d\u000a    Hardwick developed the terminology of the discipline, categorising the\u000d\u000a      different types of relationship between a classical source text and the\u000d\u000a      ways in which it can be changed creatively by users across time and space.\u000d\u000a      She was founding director of the Classical Receptions in Late\u000d\u000a        Twentieth Century Drama and Poetry in English project, funded by the\u000d\u000a      British Academy (2006-8), the main outputs of which are two searchable\u000d\u000a      online databases of archives of poetic and dramatic performances of\u000d\u000a      classical texts from 1970 to the present, hosted by the OU. This archive\u000d\u000a      is now widely used both by UK and overseas researchers of all kinds and by\u000d\u000a      practitioners themselves, thereby allowing the mapping and analysis of the\u000d\u000a      role of the creative industries in contemporary society. From 2006, the\u000d\u000a      department has also published New Voices in Classical Reception,\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed and rated A by the Australian Research Council, which is\u000d\u000a      unique in showcasing the work of early career scholars in this field\u000d\u000a      (editor, Dr Trevor Fear, 2003-present).\u000d\u000a    In RAE 2008, work undertaken in this unit centred on the relationships\u000d\u000a      with classical literature in contemporary UK drama and poetry, with Dr\u000d\u000a      Paula James (1993-present) also working on film and television [2].\u000d\u000a      Developing this focus, the 2009 monograph [3] by Dr James Robson\u000d\u000a      (2000-present) foregrounds the performance aspect of Aristophanes' plays\u000d\u000a      in their ancient context, and investigates the way in which they have been\u000d\u000a      translated and performed in the modern world, suggesting criteria through\u000d\u000a      which modern translations and productions might usefully be assessed. The\u000d\u000a      appointment of Dr Laura Swift (2012-present) further addresses receptions\u000d\u000a      of Greek literature; her 2013 work [4] shows how the identity of the\u000d\u000a      tragic chorus is intrinsically fluid, and that this allows dramatists to\u000d\u000a      use it to shed light on questions of social grouping and affiliation.\u000d\u000a      Other appointments in this census period further extend the focus on\u000d\u000a      Classical Receptions. Dr Joanna Paul's (2011-present) monograph [5]\u000d\u000a      demonstrates how the connections between cinema and classical material &#8212;\u000d\u000a      in particular, epic, as both literary tradition and socially-engaged\u000d\u000a      performance &#8212; are more significant and more complex than is often assumed,\u000d\u000a      and go far beyond straightforward notions of historical authenticity or\u000d\u000a      literary adaptation. The work of Professor Helen King (2011-present)\u000d\u000a      investigates uses of the ancient world in medicine from the sixteenth\u000d\u000a      century to the present day. Her 2013 monograph Making Sex on Trial\u000d\u000a      [6] shows how two classical stories, the Hippocratic case history of\u000d\u000a      Phaethousa and the story of Agnodice (the `first midwife'), formed the\u000d\u000a      battlefield on which those proposing very different approaches to sex\u000d\u000a      difference fought in the early modern period. These classical sources,\u000d\u000a      hardly known today, were sufficiently flexible for supporters of both\u000d\u000a      `one-sex' and `two-sex' models to cite them as authorities, and were\u000d\u000a      familiar to a wide public as well as to medical practitioners, both\u000d\u000a      physicians and midwives.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36395","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Nicholls' work on creating a digital reconstruction of the entire city of\u000a      ancient Rome has generated\u000a      very considerable impact in the following areas:\u000a    Commercial publication and broadcast work\u000a    Articles about the model have appeared in international publications Dossiers\u000a        D'Arch&#233;ologie\u000a      (December 2009) and Storica National Geographic (May 2011), as\u000a      well as the UK's BBC History\u000a        Magazine (February 2011, circulation 73,000), in which Nicholls'\u000a      research was described as\u000a      `groundbreaking' and `the world's most up-to-date model of ancient Rome'.\u000a      It has also been used\u000a      to illustrate commercial and academic publications in the UK and overseas.\u000a    Nicholls' work led the BBC to commission a series of digital\u000a      reconstructions for broadcast in the\u000a      programme Rome's Final Frontier (7 December 2012, initial viewing\u000a      figures 164,000), for which the\u000a      director wrote: `The reaction from the BBC has been extremely positive.\u000a        Graphics are\u000a        commonplace in television, yet your work brought a weight of academic\u000a        credibility to the project'.\u000a    The digital model was also used for the documentary Strip the City:\u000a        Rome, appearing at several\u000a      points throughout the programme to enable viewers to understand the\u000a      architecture and layout of\u000a      the city. The programme was transmitted by Discovery Canada in October\u000a      2012, by Discovery\u000a      Science and Quest in February 2013, and on terrestrial channels throughout\u000a      the world. The UK\u000a      production company, Windfall Farms, writes that the work `has now been\u000a        shown in several\u000a        countries and all to very high critical acclaim ... your model has\u000a        proven a real success at\u000a        increasing public awareness! I'm quite sure many of the key stories in\u000a        the programme would not\u000a        have been possible without it'. This demonstrates that Nicholls'\u000a      model has achieved impact both\u000a      through its value to the production firms involved and through improving\u000a      understanding among\u000a      huge international audiences.\u000a    Paedagogical impact\u000a    The digital model is now used for teaching purposes at UK universities\u000a      such as Durham, St\u000a      Andrew's, and Nottingham, where it has been used to illustrate\u000a      undergraduate modules and to\u000a      provide pictorial material for use in examination papers since 2011. It\u000a      has also been used\u000a      overseas, in undergraduate teaching at the British School at Rome (c.80\u000a      students 2008-11), and in\u000a      a workshop on digital modelling at Venice International University in\u000a      collaboration with Duke\u000a      University, North Carolina. In addition, it was the subject of a lecture\u000a      at the Higher Education\u000a      Academy's annual Humanities conference in May 2013, generating further\u000a      speaking invitations\u000a      from the HEA's Discipline Lead for History who wrote \"your presentation\u000a      ... last May was a\u000a      highlight, if not the highlight for me\"'. Outside the higher-education\u000a      sector the model has been used\u000a      to illustrate talks to around 50 schools, museums and societies over a\u000a      five-year period, reaching a\u000a      total audience of c.3,000 mostly GCSE and A-level pupils and adults.\u000a      Reaction has been uniformly\u000a      positive and includes comments such as the following from the Head of\u000a      Godolphin and Latymer\u000a      School: `Many of our students ... found it really inspiring. They have\u000a        also uniformly commented on\u000a        the usefulness of the models and illustrations to their understanding\u000a        ... and have been able to\u000a        comment thoughtfully on the central tenets of the lecture.'\u000a    Impact within the travel industry\u000a    Nicholls' work lends itself to use in the tourism industry, as there is a\u000a      large public appetite for visual\u000a      representations of the ancient past. He has worked in particular with the\u000a      two travel companies\u000a      described below, offering holidays to ancient sites in the Mediterranean,\u000a      achieving an impact both\u000a      on the activities of these companies and on the customers they serve, by\u000a      providing a unique\u000a      experience which enhances their clients' understanding of the architecture\u000a      and archaeology of\u000a      ancient cities and monuments, especially those of Rome. Nicholls' lectures\u000a      are advertised in the\u000a      promotional material for both companies and help to generate sales.\u000a    a) Voyages to Antiquity: Nicholls has worked with this company on\u000a      five tours around the ancient\u000a      Mediterranean (2010-present, addressing a total of c.1,600 passengers),\u000a      and as a consultant. The\u000a      firm's Enhancement Programme Director, writes: `Dr Nicholls' lectures\u000a        on board our ships on a\u000a        variety of topics have been very well received, often using his\u000a        innovative digital architectural\u000a        models and research work to add to our passengers' understanding.'\u000a    b) Westminster Classic Tours. Nicholls has worked with this\u000a      company, which arranges niche\u000a      tours for over 200 customers per year and has a turnover of more than\u000a      &#163;0.5m, on tour design and\u000a      lecturing since 2007. On the basis of customer interest in lectures\u000a      drawing on his research, he was\u000a      asked in 2012 to join the firm's Board of Directors.\u000a    The cumulative worth of these areas of impact, and in particular\u000a      the consistently positive\u000a      reactions to Nicholls' work from the tourist and education sectors, led\u000a      Cambridge University Press\u000a      to offer him a contract in June 2013 for a print book and package of\u000a      digital products (such as e-books\u000a      in various formats), drawing on his work in digital modelling of ancient\u000a      Rome. This\u000a      demonstrates the scholarly validity of this research project and will\u000a      sustain, broaden and deepen its\u000a      global impact.\u000a    Impacts from related work\u000a    Beyond this, Nicholls' work on ancient books and libraries has led\u000a      directly to his participation in\u000a      BBC Radio 4 programmes such as In Our Time (initial listening\u000a      figures of two million) and `Our\u000a        Libraries: the next chapter', a documentary on libraries.

His work particularly\u000a      concerns the architecture,\u000a      contents and use of public library buildings and their monumental role in\u000a      Rome and other cities,\u000a      drawing on both literary and archaeological source material. As part of\u000a      this work, Nicholls\u000a      developed an interest in conveying his findings through 3D architectural\u000a      modelling, initially of\u000a      library buildings and their urban surroundings.\u000a    Building on this background in ancient buildings and monuments and his\u000a      abilities as a 3D computer\u000a      modeller, Nicholls has gone on to create an enormously detailed digital\u000a      model of the entire city of\u000a      ancient Rome. While the very early development of the model began during\u000a      his DPhil work,\u000a      c.2005, the great majority of it has been undertaken and completed in\u000a      Nicholls' post as a lecturer\u000a      (now senior lecturer) at the University of Reading (2007-present).\u000a    Nicholls conducted the detailed interdisciplinary research necessary for\u000a      the proper understanding\u000a      and representation of individual buildings and sections of the city using,\u000a      for example, ancient\u000a      literary sources, inscriptions, modern archaeological reports and\u000a      Renaissance drawings of lost\u000a      ruins. Such research was carried out through field trips to Rome for\u000a      observations, measurement,\u000a      photography and `field testing' of the model (every year since 2005), and\u000a      through participation in\u000a      international conferences and workshops. This has been an enormous\u000a      undertaking, involving both\u000a      a scholarly understanding of the architecture and landscape of the entire\u000a      city, and the acquisition of\u000a      the technical skills to convey this digitally (the model contains, for\u000a      example, about 9,000 buildings\u000a      and 3.26Gb of data).\u000a    The conclusions of Nicholls' research are expressed both in his print\u000a      publications and also through\u000a      incorporation into his digital model of Rome, which was constructed using\u000a      commercial software\u000a      packages such as SketchUp and CINEMA 4D. The overall model of the city is\u000a      then used to\u000a      generate still and moving images for incorporation into, for example,\u000a      academic and commercial\u000a      publications, slideshows, lectures and other teaching aids, online\u000a      material and footage for\u000a      broadcast.\u000a    Nicholls' work is one of a small but growing number of academic projects\u000a      using digital tools to\u000a      recreate ancient places. It is distinguished from other initiatives on\u000a      ancient Rome (of which there\u000a      are two others in the world, Rome Reborn at the University of Virginia and\u000a      a digital project at the\u000a      University of Caen Basse-Normandie) by its methodological approach, the\u000a      nature of the software\u000a      used, its level of detail and the uses to which it can be put in\u000a      generating images for print and web\u000a      distribution. These have created a unique digital asset with a wide range\u000a      of applications and a\u000a      claim to be considered the most visually detailed and naturalistic model\u000a      of ancient Rome to date.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37315","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The development of an improved sex and relationship education service is\u000a      a key priority in the\u000a      South West where rates of sexually transmitted disease infection are\u000a      increasing, and the teenage\u000a      pregnancy rate is both higher than the national average in many areas\u000a      (especially Torbay and\u000a      Plymouth) and not reducing in line with national targets. Agencies in the\u000a      South West have\u000a      highlighted the need for such education to take place not only in formal\u000a      educational settings, but\u000a      also within the wider community (youth groups, drop-in centres, museums\u000a      and libraries) and to\u000a      include a broad range of issues to do with emotional health and\u000a      well-being, including self-esteem,\u000a      communication skills, life skills, understandings of power and consent,\u000a      positive relationships, and\u000a      social pressures. Recent Department of Education guidelines highlight the\u000a      importance of sex\u000a      education which helps `children and young people develop confidence in\u000a      talking, listening and\u000a      thinking about sex and relationships'. The research of Langlands and\u000a      Fisher speaks directly to\u000a      these agenda and through the Sex and History project is having a direct\u000a      impact on mental and\u000a      physical health (with particular relevance to sexual health) in Devon and\u000a      Cornwall in two distinct\u000a      ways: directly (through work with young people and their\u000a      teachers\/educators) and indirectly (by\u000a      making a contribution to policy discussion). In December 2008, Langlands\u000a      and Fisher established\u000a      Sex and History, and developed their particular methodology of using\u000a      museum objects to facilitate\u000a      the exploration of contemporary issues around sex, gender and personal\u000a      identity, in collaboration\u000a      with five regional museums, in excess of 30 schools and colleges, sexual\u000a      health charities, sex\u000a      education experts, local authority youth services, young people's\u000a      charities and arts organisations.\u000a      The project's methodology has since been implemented in a variety of\u000a      settings, with positive long-\u000a      term impacts. Sex and History has involved museum-based workshops,\u000a      creative responses (linked\u000a      in some cases to coursework, including film making, soundscapes, dance,\u000a      animation), museum\u000a      visits, intergenerational discussion, exhibition curation, sex education\u000a      sessions within schools\u000a      (totalling in excess of 1,000 young participants), and a sex education\u000a      resource pack, developed\u000a      with Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro, trialled in 20 schools in Cornwall\u000a      (totalling in excess of 15,000\u000a      pupils).\u000a    An independent evaluation by Hope Stone Research [1] (drawing on over 100\u000a      interviews) has\u000a      concluded that the project has delivered significant social outcomes for\u000a      the young people involved:\u000a      `it empowered participants to talk honestly in a trusting environment\u000a      (through the projective\u000a      techniques - discussing in the third person, and exploring historical\u000a      objects and behaviour in the\u000a      past, rather than the embarrassment of talking about sex directly); opened\u000a      up discussion of topics\u000a      that are particularly difficult to address, concerning issues such as\u000a      consent, pornography and\u000a      power within relationships; provided young people with an awareness of\u000a      historical difference that\u000a      encouraged them to challenge contemporary attitudes or resist peer\u000a      pressure; fostered greater\u000a      understanding of cultural difference; encouraged social and familial ties\u000a      (many reported that they\u000a      were able to have discussions with their peers and in particular their\u000a      parents, often for the first\u000a      time); encouraged healthy lifestyles and contributed to mental and\u000a      physical well being (some\u000a      projects had a noticeable impact on participants' body image and\u000a      self-esteem) [1, 3, 7]. A\u000a      participant from Exeter's state tertiary education college stated: \"We\u000a        found it inspirational...The\u000a        historical objects opened our minds to new ideas. It made us more mature\u000a        in the way we thought\u000a        about sex. We all discovered things about ourselves.\" A Team Leader\u000a      from Plymouth Youth\u000a      Service commented: \"In every young person in our group we can see how\u000a        this project has\u000a        developed and moved them to a different place.\"\u000a    The effect of using the Sex and History methodology in projects with\u000a      vulnerable young people was\u000a      particularly profound. A long-term evaluation report [3] which traced the\u000a      lives of 35 participants\u000a      referred by Plymouth Children's services over a 3 year period, concluded\u000a      that the Sex and History\u000a      methodology had enriched their lives, ameliorated some of the effects of\u000a      structural disadvantages\u000a      and provided a sustained transformation in future opportunities and\u000a      personal well-being. One, who\u000a      was in trouble for shoplifting, was deemed by a magistrate to have\u000a      successfully turned his life\u000a      around, as a result of his involvement in Sex and History, and\u000a      subsequently obtained work as a\u000a      child-care apprentice. Another, who enrolled in a media course and secured\u000a      employment as a\u000a      producer with an arts company, commented: \"It gave me direction; it\u000a        showed me what I was\u000a        capable of. It changed me to the person I am now. It was a major turning\u000a        point in my life.\"\u000a    A report on the trial of a sex education resource pack [2] found it to be\u000a      attractive and useful, and\u000a      this initiative is now informing policy debate. A teacher from Exeter\u000a      Academy of Music and Sound\u000a      said: \"We have to deliver certain SRE targets in college and we use\u000a        college tutorials ... [but] it's\u000a        hard. This provided a new way of meeting these requirements. The objects\u000a        are surprising... They\u000a        facilitate discussion, they make it okay to talk about sex...We've never\u000a        found a better way to do it.\u000a        It was a revelation. ....\" Langlands and Fisher are continuing\u000a      develop the methodology and\u000a      methods of delivery, and work towards embedding it in national sex\u000a      education policy and delivery,\u000a      in collaboration with regional co-ordinators of PHSE and SRE in Bristol,\u000a      Cornwall and Devon and\u000a      with the newly-formed national RSE Hub, and have recently been invited to\u000a      showcase the project\u000a      at the national Sex Education Forum.\u000a    In all its many manifestations (object-based workshops in schools and\u000a      colleges in Devon and\u000a      Cornwall, museum\/archival visits, exhibition curation and creative\u000a      object-response projects [1, 2, 5,\u000a      6, 7, 8, 9, 10]), the Sex and History project has brought young people\u000a      into close collaboration with\u000a      five regional museums (Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, Plymouth City\u000a      Museum, RCM Truro,\u000a      RAMM Exeter, Russell Coates Museum, Bournemouth) their collections, and\u000a      the Wellcome Trust\u000a      collection in London. A third party report concluded that the use of the\u000a      Sex and History\u000a      methodology in museum settings transformed relationships between museums\u000a      and young people\u000a      (already identified as an important but hard to reach audience). Young\u000a      people reported a change in\u000a      their attitudes towards what museums can offer, a new appreciation of the\u000a      value of historic objects\u000a      and their relevance to their own lives, and some are now working towards\u000a      future careers in the\u000a      cultural sector [3, 10]. Museums reported a change in the ways in which\u000a      they use their collections,\u000a      a rethinking of their archiving and cataloguing practices, and new\u000a      learning about their objects from\u000a      the research. Museums found the methodology a refreshing and effective way\u000a      of working with\u000a      young people, engaging them on a deep level, e.g. through co-curation,\u000a      which produced\u000a      impressive creative outputs that enhanced the museums' displays and\u000a      reached new audiences [1].\u000a      In Truro the methodology informed a reshaping of the ways in which the\u000a      museum staff work with\u000a      their collections. Staff were retrained and a report published by Truro\u000a      has been promoted nationally\u000a      by the Collections Trust as an example of best practice within the\u000a      nationwide Revisiting\u000a      Collections' agenda [10].\u000a    Through the Sex and History project, Exeter University, young people's\u000a      charities, sexual health\u000a      agencies, arts organisations and museums have developed new, mutually\u000a      beneficial long-term\u000a      connections and partnerships. The Sex and History project has received\u000a      positive media attention, it\u000a      won an award for Outstanding Social and Cultural Impact at the Exeter\u000a      Impact Awards (2011) and\u000a      was put forward for an EngageU award for European innovation in university\u000a      public engagement.\u000a      Since 2009 Sex and History's innovative methodology has been widely\u000a      recognised as an effective\u000a      and adaptable model, and has attracted a wide range of partners who seek\u000a      to make use of it. The\u000a      third party report also highlighted the economic benefits to partner\u000a      organisations of working with\u000a      the Sex and History methodology: Fictional Projects is using the\u000a      methodology to construct a\u000a      marketable games-based resource, youth facilitators have used to project\u000a      to develop consultancy\u000a      work, and the dynamics arts company Effervescent attributed the\u000a      increase of its turnover by 320%\u000a      between 2010-11 and 2012-13, its increased regional visibility and its\u000a      showcasing by the Arts\u000a      Council to its work on the Sex and History project. [1] The methodology is\u000a      currently being\u000a      developed with leading children's charity Barnardos as a way of working\u000a      with very vulnerable\u000a      young people. The Arts Council has showcased the project as a model for\u000a      using the arts to\u000a      enhance health and well-being. It was presented at a workshop on Strategic\u000a      Commissioning for the\u000a      Arts, Health and Wellbeing, a keynote provocation on Next Steps in\u000a      Commissioning Arts and\u000a      Health practice to symposium of regional experts in Health, Wellbeing and\u000a      the Arts, and\u000a      showcased at the Devon Museums Forum 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research of Dr Rebecca Langlands (Department of Classics, University\u000a      of Exeter) into sexual\u000a      identities, choices and behaviours both ancient and modern has informed a\u000a      pioneering approach to\u000a      improving young people's well-being and sexual health.

It\u000a      demonstrated that material from and narratives about the past played a\u000a      significant role in such\u000a      acculturation. Her research also articulated the benefits for modern\u000a      awareness of human diversity\u000a      of this detailed study of ancient Rome, describing a culture with a\u000a      different way of thinking about\u000a      sex and ethics and with different preoccupations, revealing the culturally\u000a      contingent nature of\u000a      some of our current dominant controversies around sex. Langlands joined\u000a      Exeter in 1998.\u000a    These findings fuelled her subsequent collaborative research with\u000a      Professor Kate Fisher\u000a      (Department of History, University of Exeter since 2000), which is focused\u000a      on elucidating the\u000a      power of the past in the construction of ideas about sex. This research\u000a      has demonstrated that the\u000a      past continues to be used as a means of legitimising, articulating and\u000a      disseminating knowledge\u000a      about sex (section 3, reference 6). As a case-study, Langlands and Fisher\u000a      researched the impact\u000a      of sexually-themed material found at the archaeological sites of Pompeii\u000a      and Herculaneum,\u000a      especially the Brothel and the Secret Museum, on visitors' understanding\u000a      of sex. Two major\u000a      articles have established the effect of such material on the shaping of\u000a      sexual identities over the\u000a      centuries (see section 3 references 3 and 4).\u000a    A key and original finding of this interdisciplinary, collaborative\u000a      research is that material from past\u000a      cultures can act as a productive and challenging stimulus, through which\u000a      people can explore,\u000a      develop and think about sexual questions. The research into tourists at\u000a      Pompeii and Herculaneum\u000a      demonstrated the ways such visits were experienced as eye-opening and\u000a      empowering encounters\u000a      which expanded people's horizons, opened up new ways of thinking about\u000a      sex, sexual customs,\u000a      morality, codes, power and autonomy, and legitimated alternative ways of\u000a      being. Material culture\u000a      from past societies such as ancient Rome continues to be beneficial in the\u000a      development of sexual\u000a      identities in several ways. It demonstrates cultural and historical\u000a      diversity, allowing people to reflect\u000a      on similarities and differences between cultures. It offers\u000a      thought-provoking evidence about human\u000a      practices, yet provides historical distance that depersonalises\u000a      discussion. It can be interpreted in\u000a      many different ways, enabling people to come up with their own\u000a      interpretations and test theories\u000a      against their own preconceptions and it also empowers people with the\u000a      awareness that people\u000a      have been talking about, thinking about and depicting sex for millennia,\u000a      encouraging them to feel it\u000a      is all right for them to do so too. Visual material, such as pictures and\u000a      artefacts, is revealed by this\u000a      research to be a particularly effective medium, providing an immediate and\u000a      arresting point of\u000a      engagement with the past. This research also explored the issues at stake\u000a      in museums displays\u000a      and the challenges museums face in engaging with their varied audiences.\u000a    Together, these research findings underpin the Sex and History project,\u000a      directed by Dr Langlands\u000a      and Professor Fisher. The project reconstructs the kind of productive\u000a      engagement with the past\u000a      experienced by tourists in Pompeii and Herculaneum, through a variety of\u000a      public and school-based\u000a      interventions, workshops and museum visits that use sexually-themed\u000a      historical objects as a\u000a      springboard for creative discussion, debate and reflection in groups of\u000a      young people. The\u000a      methodology used in these sessions also draws directly on the results of\u000a      Langlands' research into\u000a      moral education in ancient Rome, where open-ended debate about scenarios\u000a      from which they\u000a      have some cultural distance is shown to have been a particularly effective\u000a      method of engaging\u000a      young people in productive discussion about controversial issues of the\u000a      day (see section 3\u000a      reference 3). Sex and History pioneers a new approach to sex education; it\u000a      provides a wider social\u000a      and cultural framework for the assimilation of biological and practical\u000a      information about sexual\u000a      health, and empowers young people to make healthy choices about sex and\u000a      relationships.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38898","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    White's research on the Roman city of Wroxeter and the region has had\u000d\u000a      significant impact on: the\u000d\u000a      running and management of the site; English Heritage policy; education and\u000d\u000a      public discourse; and\u000d\u000a      on economic prosperity within the region.\u000d\u000a    White's research directly influenced the running and management of the\u000d\u000a      site by English Heritage.\u000d\u000a      Through his research, White has become universally regarded as the leading\u000d\u000a      authority on the\u000d\u000a      Roman city of Wroxeter and the region, and so he was commissioned by\u000d\u000a      English Heritage to\u000d\u000a      formulate the site's Management Plan between December 2008 and June 2010.\u000d\u000a      The Management\u000d\u000a      Plan continues to provide a guiding framework for engagement with the\u000d\u000a        site at all levels and\u000d\u000a      this has been implemented through the creation of a Conservation\u000d\u000a      Management Plan [see source\u000d\u000a      1 below] which is scheduled to be revised every five years.

The principal focus of this research was on the completion of a\u000d\u000a      building-by-building\u000d\u000a      description and interpretation of the Roman city of Wroxeter (the 4th\u000d\u000a      largest Roman settlement in\u000d\u000a      Britain), based on geophysical data and aerial photographs of the site.\u000d\u000a      This was the first project of\u000d\u000a      its type ever attempted for Roman Britain, and one that has revolutionised\u000d\u000a      the understanding of the\u000d\u000a      city's chronology, development and demise.\u000d\u000a    The research outlined above represents a considerable legacy of work at\u000d\u000a      the Roman city of\u000d\u000a      Wroxeter by UoB. White's research there commenced in 1976, just two years\u000d\u000a      after the site came\u000d\u000a      under the care of the State. From 1987, he was engaged to write the final\u000d\u000a      report for a major state-funded\u000d\u000a      excavation on the baths basilica at Wroxeter and, from 1994, he was\u000d\u000a      employed by the UoB\u000d\u000a      as a Leverhulme Research Fellow on the Wroxeter Hinterland Project (WHP).\u000d\u000a      The WHP was a\u000d\u000a      landscape scale remote sensing project that ran from 1994 until 1997 and\u000d\u000a      was led by academics\u000d\u000a      from UoB in collaboration with teams from Britain, France, Germany, the\u000d\u000a      USA and Japan, in\u000d\u000a      addition to private companies, governmental institutions and amateur\u000d\u000a      groups. At the time, the\u000d\u000a      survey was amongst the largest and most ambitious ever attempted, covering\u000d\u000a      an area of 78\u000d\u000a      hectares. In addition to generating the first comprehensive and extensive\u000d\u000a      plans of the buried\u000d\u000a      landscape, the project had outputs including novel web-based virtual\u000d\u000a      reality reconstructions funded\u000d\u000a      by British Telecom. In 1997, the WHP won the Queen's Anniversary Prize for\u000d\u000a      Higher and Further\u000d\u000a      Education for `Outstanding archaeological work and results made plain and\u000d\u000a      of value to the wider\u000d\u000a      public.'\u000d\u000a    The first monograph resulting from the WHP (see output R1 below) focused\u000d\u000a      on the wider\u000d\u000a      landscape around the Roman city of Wroxeter and received very significant\u000d\u000a      international\u000d\u000a      recognition. Following this, White's research between 2008 and 2012\u000d\u000a      focused on the interpretation\u000d\u000a      of the site following a building-by-building analysis of all data sources,\u000d\u000a      revolutionising\u000d\u000a      understanding of the site, and resulting in a monograph focusing on the\u000d\u000a      description and\u000d\u000a      interpretation of the whole of the city (R2). This was also the subject of\u000d\u000a      White's contribution to the\u000d\u000a      World Archaeology Congress in Jordan in January 2013. Since 1997, White\u000d\u000a      has written, or had\u000d\u000a      significant input into, six monographs on the site, along with many\u000d\u000a      research papers. His research\u000d\u000a      at Wroxeter and across western Britain in the later Roman Empire also\u000d\u000a      resulted in a sole-authored\u000d\u000a      book on the Roman province of Britannia Prima (R3). This volume was\u000d\u000a      awarded the honour of\u000d\u000a      Book of the Year in 2009 by the readers of Current Archaeology Magazine,\u000d\u000a      the leading\u000d\u000a      archaeology magazine in the UK, which caters to both professional\u000d\u000a      archaeologists and the\u000d\u000a      interested general public.\u000d\u000a    White's unparalleled research into the interpretation of the Roman city\u000d\u000a      led to him being\u000d\u000a      commissioned by English Heritage in 2009 to produce three key documents\u000d\u000a      relating to the current\u000d\u000a      management and public interpretation of the site: the management plan, a\u000d\u000a      web-based research\u000d\u000a      tool for the public and for fellow academics and an updated guidebook. The\u000d\u000a      findings of this\u000d\u000a      research have also been used directly to inform the writing of the latest\u000d\u000a      publications on the site and\u000d\u000a      the new interpretation to be used in the new galleries of the Shropshire\u000d\u000a      Museum, ensuring that the\u000d\u000a      research conclusions will have a very measurable impact on the public\u000d\u000a      visiting the site or the\u000d\u000a      museum well into the future.\u000d\u000a    The research at Wroxeter has also led to the exploration of the impact of\u000d\u000a      the excavation of the site\u000d\u000a      in terms of the academic discipline (R4) and White also delivered a paper\u000d\u000a      on this theme at the\u000d\u000a      European Archaeological Association conference at Pilzen, Czech Republic\u000d\u000a      in September 2013.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38899","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Dr. Esmonde Cleary was approached by The National Trust in 2010 to\u000d\u000a      contribute to the\u000d\u000a      development of the Chedworth Roman villa through the undertaking of the\u000d\u000a      research detailed\u000d\u000a      above.

In particular he was a member\u000d\u000a      of and expert adviser to\u000d\u000a      the: Interpretation Team; Archaeology, Archives and Conservation Board; as\u000d\u000a      well as to the\u000d\u000a      commercial contractors (Furneaux Stewart) for undertaking the work.\u000d\u000a      Initially, therefore, impact\u000d\u000a      was upon the methods and ideas of the professionals with whom he worked.\u000d\u000a      Insights from the\u000d\u000a      research project conducted by Esmonde Cleary at all times informed the\u000d\u000a      choices made about how\u000d\u000a      to present the site to the visiting public [see source 1 below]. These\u000d\u000a      included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The basic concept of `The Golden Age of Roman Britain'\u000d\u000a      The idea that this should challenge popular stereotypes of the Roman\u000d\u000a        period\u000d\u000a      The concept of the multi-media presentation as a weekend `house party'\u000d\u000a      The characters to be involved in this presentation, their social\u000d\u000a        standing, their attitudes, their\u000d\u000a        dress, food etc.\u000d\u000a      How such characters could help explain why the villa was the way it\u000d\u000a        was (lay-out, use of\u000d\u000a        rooms, d&#233;cor, social rituals etc.).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Such considerations also informed the production of the new site\u000d\u000a      guidebook [source 2], the new\u000d\u000a      signage at the site, the creation of a series of artist's reconstructions\u000d\u000a      of the villa and or parts of the\u000d\u000a      villa, which in turn were used in the new displays and the guidebook in\u000d\u000a      order to give a common\u000d\u000a      `message' and visual language across the various forms of presentation to\u000d\u000a      visitors.\u000d\u000a    During the building and development process, impact was also upon The\u000d\u000a      National Trust itself. The\u000d\u000a      project was run within the context of the organisation's mission to inform\u000d\u000a      the visitors to its\u000d\u000a      properties, such as Chedworth, with the results of up-to-date academic\u000d\u000a      research appropriately\u000d\u000a      presented. This meant that the various outputs described above, and also\u000d\u000a      including the History\u000d\u000a      Press book (output R1 above), were created with one or more of The\u000d\u000a      National Trust's market\u000d\u000a      segments (defined by criteria such as age, purpose of visit etc.) clearly\u000d\u000a      in view. The overall aim of\u000d\u000a      the mission was to optimise the `visitor experience' and to maximise the\u000d\u000a      number of different\u000d\u000a      segments addressed. The success of this in the new presentation and the\u000d\u000a      centrality of academic\u000d\u000a      research-derived advice has made Chedworth a model for other National\u000d\u000a      Trust properties as they\u000d\u000a      come to be upgraded.\u000d\u000a    Since the reopening of the Chedworth site in April 2012, Esmonde Cleary's\u000d\u000a      research has made a\u000d\u000a      significant contribution to the quality of the visitor experience at\u000d\u000a      Chedworth. The new presentation\u000d\u000a      of the site is much more comprehensive, varied and up-to-date than the\u000d\u000a      previous presentation,\u000d\u000a      providing the visiting public with a much richer suite of information and\u000d\u000a      stimuli to draw upon. Visitor\u000d\u000a      numbers increased from 32,401 in 2011-2012, to 78,961 in 2012-2013, after\u000d\u000a      the reopening [source\u000d\u000a      3]. This increase in visitor numbers has been matched by the biggest\u000d\u000a      increase in VE (the National\u000d\u000a      Trust's visitor satisfaction score) experienced for any National Trust\u000d\u000a      property, from 32% in 2011-2012,\u000d\u000a      to 64% in 2012-2013 (with the score at 66% for 2013-2014) [source 3]. In\u000d\u000a      addition, the\u000d\u000a      guidebook (authored by Esmonde Cleary and providing a contextualisation\u000d\u000a      and digest of the\u000d\u000a      research presented in greater detail in the History Press book) registered\u000d\u000a      onsite sales of 2065 in\u000d\u000a      the period from April 2012 - July 2013. Renewed interest in the site\u000d\u000a      following the re-opening also\u000d\u000a      resulted in an increase in volunteers at the site over the same time\u000d\u000a      period from 5 to 46 (collectively\u000d\u000a      contributing a total of 5514 hours). Feedback from volunteers revealed\u000d\u000a      that most were attracted to\u000d\u000a      working at Chedworth because of the re-interpretation and presentation\u000d\u000a      [source 3].\u000d\u000a    In summary, Esmonde Cleary's research into Chedworth Roman villa has had\u000d\u000a      an impact upon the\u000d\u000a      ideas and methods of those professionals working on the redesign and\u000d\u000a      development of the site, by\u000d\u000a      providing them with accurate and relevant historical input. The wider\u000d\u000a      impact of this is upon\u000d\u000a      National Trust policy, and will be upon future developments within the\u000d\u000a      National Trust, where\u000d\u000a      academic research will now form a key element of design and presentation.\u000d\u000a      Visitor numbers,\u000d\u000a      guidebook sales and satisfaction ratings since the reopening of Chedworth\u000d\u000a      with the new content\u000d\u000a      and presentation, provide clear indication that tourism has also been\u000d\u000a      stimulated and the visitor\u000d\u000a      experience has improved as a result of Esmonde Cleary's involvement.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research undertaken for The National Trust at the Romano-British villa at\u000d\u000a      Chedworth (Glos.) has\u000d\u000a      contributed to the re-display of the villa in a project funded by the\u000d\u000a      Heritage Lottery Fund and\u000d\u000a      others.

Research on the primary evidence of the villa\u000d\u000a      fabric and the remaining finds,\u000d\u000a      on the unpublished archive held by the National Trust and on the published\u000d\u000a      material, has allowed a\u000d\u000a      narrative of the development of the villa and its likely uses in the\u000d\u000a      fourth century.\u000d\u000a    The information thus gained has been placed in the context of the study\u000d\u000a      of other Romano-British\u000d\u000a      villas of the fourth century, particularly the larger, more elaborate\u000d\u000a      ones, and particularly the\u000d\u000a      important group in the Cotswolds of which Chedworth is a member. In\u000d\u000a      addition, wider knowledge of\u000d\u000a      late Roman villas in Europe and of what their plans represent in terms of\u000d\u000a      social and cultural\u000d\u000a      structures and use has been applied to Chedworth to inform discussion of\u000d\u000a      the excavated remains.\u000d\u000a      A notable feature of the villa is the quantity and quality of the mosaics\u000d\u000a      and other decorative\u000d\u000a      elements. A novel interpretation concerns the importance of hunting to the\u000d\u000a      late Roman aristocrat,\u000d\u000a      as evidenced at Chedworth. In addition a programme of laser scanning of\u000d\u000a      the visible remains was\u000d\u000a      carried out to generate a detailed record of the upstanding fabric. This\u000d\u000a      survey will feed into\u000d\u000a      academic research on the villa by analysing which stonework is in situ\u000d\u000a      Roman-period and which is\u000d\u000a      related to the various phases of the nineteenth &#8212; and twentieth-century\u000d\u000a      consolidation and display of\u000d\u000a      the villa, the latter in itself of considerable interest in the study of\u000d\u000a      the presentation of the heritage to\u000d\u000a      the public. It will also be a management tool for the National Trust both\u000d\u000a      as a detailed record and\u000d\u000a      since regular re-survey will show how the structures have responded to,\u000d\u000a      for example,\u000d\u000a      environmental conditions such as freeze and thaw cycles.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38900","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of Brubaker's expertise on Byzantine icons and iconoclasm is\u000a      evident from the content\u000a      of trade publications directed at the museum-going public (4D below), the\u000a      translation of her 2012\u000a      book into Italian to serve as a set text in the medieval history\u000a      curriculum at five Italian universities\u000a      (details in E below), and her impact on museums and the practice of museum\u000a      professionals, in\u000a      particular the 2006 invitation to sit on the advisory board for the 2008\u000a      exhibition `Byzantium' at the\u000a      Royal Academy; the 2009 invitation from Harvard to organise a colloquium\u000a      on Iconoclasms; and,\u000a      most importantly in this context, from her invitation to a series of\u000a      consultative meetings at Tate\u000a      Britain in 2010 to discuss its exhibition on Iconoclasm, Art under\u000a        Attack (opened 30.09.13). This, in\u000a      turn, led to Tate's inclusion as a participating institution (along with\u000a      the University of Notre Dame in\u000a      Indiana USA) in the AHRC Networking application, and to Brubaker's\u000a      inclusion in the full panoply\u000a      of educational events associated with the exhibition &#8212; both those aimed at\u000a      schoolchildren and\u000a      those aimed at the adult general public &#8212; sponsored by Tate (impact\u000a      occurring after July 2013).\u000a    A. From academic publications to the Iconoclasms Network\u000a      Byzantium is key to any discussion of iconoclasm because the word\u000a      `iconoclasm' was coined to\u000a      describe the debates about the validity of religious portraiture that\u000a      defined eighth- and ninth-century\u000a      Byzantium. Brubaker's expertise on Byzantine icons and iconoclasm\u000a      underpinned her role\u000a      as PI for the AHRC award that funded the Iconoclasms Network. She led all\u000a      Network discussions,\u000a      and all 16 members of the Network read and discussed the short version of\u000a      Brubaker and Haldon\u000a      2011 (R4 above) or her chapter on `Icons and Iconomachy' in the Blackwells\u000a      Companion to\u000a        Byzantium; her expertise thus formed a core component of subsequent\u000a      discussion &#8212; the\u000a      `backbone' of the Network.\u000a    B. Impact on exhibition\u000a      Following Brubaker's initial consultative meetings at Tate Britain, the\u000a      first meeting of the Network,\u000a      hosted by Tate Britain in September 2011, brainstormed and drew up a\u000a      wish-list of objects to be\u000a      included in the exhibition; the second meeting (hosted by Notre Dame in\u000a      America in September\u000a      2012) discussed the `hang' (how the pictures and objects were to be\u000a      arranged in the gallery\u000a      spaces) and all participants critiqued the near final drafts of each\u000a      other's chapters in the `popular'\u000a      book that accompanied the exhibition, Striking Images, which was\u000a      entirely written by Network\u000a      members and appeared in time for the third Network meeting, held at Tate\u000a      Britain in September\u000a      2013. The book launch for Striking Images, introduced by the\u000a      Director of Tate Britain (Dr Penelope\u000a      Curtis), occurred at Tate Britain on the night the exhibition opened, with\u000a      full press coverage. The\u000a      final chapter, written by the two curators of the exhibition and\u000a      specifically about the exhibition itself,\u000a      demonstrates the importance of the Network meetings to the exhibition:\u000a      `The [Iconoclasm]\u000a      Networks constituted the first strategy for a comparative, cross\u000a      disciplinary and cross sector study\u000a      of \"iconoclasms\" .... The [Iconoclasm Network's] workshops conceptually\u000a      anchored the\u000a      development of the exhibition Art under Attack, and provided a\u000a      range of theoretical models that\u000a      shaped the curatorial approach to British iconoclasm' (see source 1\u000a      below). As another member of\u000a      the Network wrote after viewing the exhibition: `the main thing that\u000a      struck me was how much the\u000a      show is a show-and-tell version of [the Network's] new approach to\u000a      iconoclasm.'\u000a    C. Impact on museum professional practice\u000a      The Iconoclasms Network has 16 members, 10 from the UK\/EU and 6 from North\u000a      America; 9 are\u000a      established scholars; 3 are postgraduate researchers; 4 are museum\u000a      professionals from Tate\u000a      Modern, Tate Britain, Birmingham Museums Trust, and The Fruitmarket\u000a      Gallery in Edinburgh. In\u000a      addition to direct impact on the exhibition Art under Attack at\u000a      Tate Britain, the Network had lasting\u000a      impact on museum practice. As described by one of the museum\u000a      professionals: `My participation\u000a      in the [Iconoclasms] Network has made a significant contribution to my own\u000a      professional\u000a      development. As a museum and conservation professional, the experience has\u000a      encouraged me to\u000a      consider the research agenda for my organisation, its aims and how it is\u000a      structured... I am\u000a      presently working to establish a research group made up of staff from\u000a      across the museum to test\u000a      how we develop and deliver research and this is a direct result of my\u000a      participation in the\u000a      Iconoclasms Network'. He later wrote: `My experience with the group has\u000a      changed the way I look\u000a      at the world. While I may have been aware of this lens of iconoclasm on\u000a      the periphery of my vision\u000a      when I joined the group [the Network has] helped to open up my aperture to\u000a      this view of the world.\u000a      I have always been struck by the power afforded the curator or creator in\u000a      filling the public space of\u000a      the gallery. It is an opportunity that is easily wasted and frittered away\u000a      with big statements and little\u000a      substance which is an obvious trap when dealing with this subject. [Art\u000a        under Attack has] avoided\u000a      the bear trap and grasped the opportunity to create something that is\u000a      challenging, original and\u000a      engaging which by my count is three out of three' (source 2).\u000a    D. Impact on museum publications aimed at the general public\u000a      The British Museum `popular' book Icons 2007 (aimed at the general\u000a      public rather than specialists\u000a      &#8212; source 3) omits the hitherto blanket assertion that icons were windows\u000a      to the holy from the\u000a      beginning, and instead adopts the new interpretation developed in Brubaker\u000a      (Brubaker 1989; R1\u000a      and R2) that this was part of a historical process that peaked in the late\u000a      seventh century. There\u000a      are no footnotes in this booklet, but the recommended reading (p. 138)\u000a      omits the hitherto classic\u000a      article espousing the `old' interpretation (E Kitzinger 1954: `The cult of\u000a      images in the age before\u000a      Iconoclasm', Dumbarton Oaks Papers 8 , 85-150) and instead lists\u000a      Brubaker and Haldon 2001\u000a      (R2).\u000a    E.

We expect that\u000a      other universities will also\u000a      pick this up, and our experience is that there is a wide public interest\u000a      in Italy for books of this kind.\u000a      Professor Brubaker is of course well known to all Byzantinists in Italy,\u000a      and they are anxious to have\u000a      her research available for their students' (source 4).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The three key areas of impact are:\u000a    \u000a      Changes in the approaches of museum professionals at Tate Britain and\u000a        the\u000a        Birmingham Museums Trust;\u000a      Changes in `popular' understanding of Byzantine icons, as reflected in\u000a        museum\u000a        pamphlets aimed at the general public rather than at a scholarly\u000a        audience;\u000a      Changes in the Italian university system history curriculum.\u000a    \u000a    Impact 1 is significant because it has directly and demonstrably affected\u000a      the ways that two groups\u000a      of museum professionals deal with their interface with the public.

The most\u000a      expensive exhibition ever\u000a      mounted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York was its 1997 `The\u000a      Glory of Byzantium',\u000a      which cost over $3m, and there have been major `blockbuster' exhibitions\u000a      in Baltimore (1988),\u000a      Brussels (1982), London (1994, 2008), New York (1975, 1997, 2004, 2012)\u000a      and Paris (1994). In\u000a      all cases, the medium fronted above all others was the icon, presumably\u000a      because icons capture\u000a      the public imagination and `Byzantium has traditionally been considered a\u000a      culture of icons'\u000a      (Pentcheva 2006, Icons and power: 1). How the icon is understood\u000a      in the modern world is thus a\u000a      kind of microcosm for how Byzantine art is received. Brubaker's research\u000a      on the Byzantine icon,\u000a      its development, the reactions against its power (iconoclasm) and its\u000a      subsequent triumph has thus\u000a      found broader resonance than one might expect in the museum world.\u000a    The research underpinning this impact case study has:\u000a    \u000a      Changed the way Byzantine icons are presented to the museum-going\u000a        public; and\u000a      Generated a research network that has changed the way the museum\u000a        professionals\u000a        involved approach their research agendas; and\u000a      Anchored the 2013 blockbuster exhibition at Tate Britain, Art\u000a          under Attack; and\u000a      Changed the history curriculum in the Italian university system.\u000a    \u000a    Until 1997, the `classic' articles, and all museum catalogues and\u000a      handbooks devoted to Byzantine\u000a      culture asserted that the rise in icon veneration was a seamless organic\u000a      development that began in\u000a      the fourth century, and reached a climax in the sixth. This assumption was\u000a      demolished in a\u000a      seminal article published in 1997, where Brubaker established that icons\u000a      acquired power, and\u000a      became important vehicles capable of conveying prayers to God, only toward\u000a      the end of the\u000a      seventh century (ca 680). She also showed that this represented a\u000a      dramatic shift in the role of\u000a      representation in the medieval Byzantine world. This is particularly\u000a      significant because icons are\u000a      representative of a broad Byzantine `thought world' much larger than that\u000a      encoded in texts, which\u000a      most Byzantines could not read (and never heard read out loud) and which\u000a      were predominantly\u000a      written by urban elite male authors.\u000a    Since then (particularly in two books co-authored with the Byzantine\u000a      historian John Haldon, now at\u000a      Princeton, outputs R1 and R2 below), she has established that the 680\u000a      shift was prompted by\u000a      anxiety caused by the Islamic conquests of the earlier seventh century;\u000a      and that this new power of\u000a      icons led directly to a reaction against the veneration of sacred\u000a      portraits, Iconoclasm. Belief that\u000a      icons carried the real presence of the person represented was ultimately\u000a      accepted in 843 and\u000a      remains a key tenet of Orthodox Greek Christianity.\u000a    Brubaker began the research in 1991, when she was teaching in the\u000a      American University system\u000a      (she took a position at the University of Birmingham in September 1994),\u000a      funded by a J Paul Getty\u000a      Senior Fellowship (1991\/2) which allowed her to come to Birmingham to work\u000a      with the Byzantine\u000a      historian with whom she wrote the two subsequent books on Byzantine\u000a      Iconoclasm, John Haldon.\u000a      On the basis of this work she was asked by Harvard University to lead a\u000a      colloquium on\u000a      Iconoclasms in 2009, which led to the formation of the Iconoclasms\u000a      Network, funded by an AHRC\u000a      networking grant, which takes the material beyond Byzantium, from the\u000a      broken swords of pre-historical\u000a      bog burials to contemporary `defacements' of Goya prints by the Chapman\u000a      brothers to\u000a      the Taliban's destruction of the Bamiyan buddhas, and embraces museum\u000a      professionals as well as\u000a      academic scholars.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39750","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The department's collective and collaborative research in Greek\u000a      performance culture and its continuity into the modern era feeds directly\u000a      into its design and delivery of a wide-ranging programme of community\u000a      activities. These are intended to engage the public with\u000a      socio-political issues arising from our research, enrich the cultural\u000a        life of London, and enhance tourist and visitor experience of the\u000a      Capital. They are exemplified by the longstanding annual production of a\u000a      Greek play at the UCL Bloomsbury Theatre and one-off events such as those\u000a      surrounding the London Olympics in 2012. We have energetically seized the\u000a      opportunities presented by new technologies to extend the reach of\u000a      the impacts on public awareness of and engagement with such issues.\u000a      Digitising and sharing the outcomes of these events has allowed the\u000a      department to extend the range of its impacts to include the development\u000a      and provision of reusable information and learning resources for\u000a      independent study and for use in secondary schools and in courses at HEIs\u000a      in the UK and beyond and to enhance the accessibility of its research to a\u000a      wider public audience.\u000a    The Greek Play\u000a    The UCL Greek play has run for over 25 years. It functions as an\u000a      important medium for increasing public understanding of research on Greek\u000a      poetry and performance and its applications to contemporary performance.\u000a      Since 2008 we have staged: Aeschylus' Agamemnon 2008;\u000a      Aristophanes' Frogs 2009; Aeschylus' Libation Bearers and\u000a      Eumenides 2010; Aristophanes' Lysistrata 2011; Euripides' Hippolytus\u000a      2012; Euripides' Trojan Women February 2013 (see [2] in section\u000a      5). Although the play is produced by students, staff researching Greek\u000a      drama oversee its choice of play and translation and advise on\u000a      interpretation and stagecraft, ensuring that current research is embedded\u000a      into the performance and in programme notes contributed by them. The\u000a      innovative and engaging results of their contributions can be seen, for\u000a      instance, in the (2013) location of Trojan Women (overseen by Rosa\u000a      And&#250;jar) in a modern war zone, whose setting paralleled the fluid relation\u000a      between Euripides' production, heroic myth and events of the Peloponnesian\u000a      War (see Carey [c]), and in the acclaimed Oresteia productions.\u000a      Emmanuela Bakola used her groundbreaking UCL research in Greek literature\u000a      and the environment [b] to underpin a production combining themes\u000a      uncovered by her work (the house, the earth, the economics of peace and\u000a      war, material waste). These were reflected in the play's publicity poster\u000a      (the perverted circle of nature and the chthonic associations of the\u000a      snake, a recurrent image in the trilogy), acting (contact with the soil in\u000a      Agamemnon and Libation Bearers), costume (the Erinyes as\u000a      vampires), props and space [2]. The end result was a holistic sense of a\u000a      play rooted in its political, religious, theatrical-spatial and literary\u000a      milieu. All of this was underpinned and supplemented by research-based\u000a      programme notes.\u000a    The plays are accompanied by talks for general audiences by\u000a      (especially UCL) academics, and workshops with theatre practitioners, with\u000a      generous funding initially from the Hellenic Society and the Classical\u000a      Association, and now supported by an earmarked award from the Leventis\u000a      Foundation. The talks and workshops explore issues of performance and the\u000a      relevance and meaning of ancient drama in the modern world. The reach\u000a      is demonstrated by the large audiences that the performances themselves\u000a      (1935 for Trojan Women 2013, 1879 for Hippolytus 2012) and\u000a      the accompanying lectures and workshops attract (308 at 2013 lectures, 60\u000a      at workshops &#8212; see [2] below). Participants in these events include\u000a      members of the public and school groups (students of English, modern\u000a      languages, theatre studies or drama as well as Greek or Classical\u000a      Civilisation) from many parts of the UK. The significance of this\u000a      impact is demonstrated by the positive critical reviews [1] which the\u000a      productions have received (`the UCL Classical Drama Society's production\u000a      [of Hyppolytus was] explosive' - Matthew Parris, Times\u000a      16\/02\/12, `superior to quite a few more lauded professional productions' -\u000a      Tony Keen on our 2008 Agamemnon). Extensive audience feedback\u000a      attests to the ways in which research-led performance and outreach both\u000a      (re)shapes perception and enriches education. Sample comments from the\u000a      public have included:\u000a    `showed that however much times have changed over the last couple of\u000a      thousand years, the suffering and cruelty of war continues';\u000a    `made sense of the conventions of Greek tragedy';\u000a    `excellent lecture; accessible and thought provoking; good experience for\u000a      my daughter of being in a \"uni lecture\"`;\u000a    `provided such a detailed insight into the major themes and characters,\u000a      and the impact this would have had on the society the play was first\u000a      performed to';\u000a    (and from teachers specifically):\u000a    `challenged them [visiting students] to revisit the play and their\u000a      existing interpretations';\u000a    `very pleased that the lecture did not just deal with the text, but\u000a      extended the students' knowledge by looking at the role of women and\u000a      mourning'. ([2] below)\u000a    The play website [2] supplements these educational benefits by providing\u000a      research-driven interviews, images and clips, a blog, programme notes,\u000a      essays on the plays, suggestions for further reading and study questions.\u000a      Through these media, we extend the impact of the event beyond those\u000a      watching the performance itself via an educational resource available to\u000a      everyone, allowing wider audiences (inter)nationally to engage with Greek\u000a      plays as living theatre. This reach is extended further by related\u000a      (digitised) events such as Miriam Leonard's inaugural (Tragedy and\u000a        Modernity [3]), broadcast in Australia.\u000a    London Olympics 2012\u000a    A rare opportunity to improve public understanding of Greek poetry and\u000a      performance arose thanks to the London Olympics 2012. On the basis of our\u000a      longstanding research on athletics and celebration (current: Ag&#243;cs, Carey,\u000a      past: Instone, Hornblower, Maehler) we took the lead in creating a\u000a      consortium of London cultural and educational bodies (also including the\u000a      British Museum, Institute of Classical Studies, Sir John Soane's Museum,\u000a      Egypt Exploration Society, British Academy, Petrie Museum, Hellenic and\u000a      Roman societies, Open University, Kings College London) to create a major\u000a      programme of activities and exhibitions around the London Olympics 2012 on\u000a      the theme of sport and competition in the ancient world and in its modern\u000a      receptions and renewals. As well as co-ordinating events in the capital,\u000a      we used the Roman Society website [4] as a portal for research-based\u000a      Olympic themed activities throughout Britain to showcase Classics research\u000a      nationally. The reach of this impact is demonstrated by the many\u000a      and varied audiences around the country who benefited from engagement\u000a      (either through live events or resultant video uploads), from the research\u000a      outputs generated, and from the new partnerships formed.\u000a    The programme, which ran from May to September 2012, featured three\u000a      conferences, public lectures, panel discussions (with audiences of\u000a      100-350), exhibitions, guided tours and hands-on activities in museums. It\u000a      offered a fuller understanding of the different ways in which competition\u000a      (especially but not exclusively athletic) was perceived, enacted and\u000a      memorialised in the ancient world and in the modern era, providing a foil\u000a      against which to assess contemporary competitions and help them understand\u000a      the relevance of the ancient traditions in all areas of culture.\u000a    As with the Greek plays, the reach and significance of the impacts of\u000a      live events were increased through the creation of digital learning and\u000a      information resources. Thus this impact was further enhanced by the Unit's\u000a      Ancient Olympics website [6], which is now a permanent research-based\u000a      educational resource offering summaries of key issues, related ancient\u000a      texts and artefacts, recordings of talks, essays and images on the issues\u000a      discussed, as well as suggestions for further reading and study questions.\u000a      The reach of this resource is indicated by the fact that it has\u000a      been viewed some 1200 times during the impact assessment period; its significance\u000a      as an educational resource is suggested by user comments such as `I plan\u000a      to use it with my GCSE group', and `a superb resource' [6]. It is now\u000a      being further developed in collaboration with schoolteachers and pupils.\u000a      The educational and public information impacts of the events were enhanced\u000a      and extended still further by the publication of a full set of the public\u000a      lectures on the website of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic\u000a      Studies, where they were viewed c. 2200 times during the impact assessment\u000a      period [5].\u000a    Chris Carey also gave invited public lectures on the sociology and\u000a      ethnicity of athletics and the nature of ancient competition to audiences\u000a      of 50-300 at associated events in Exeter, Nottingham, Dublin and London\u000a      and at a follow-up seminar on law and sport in October 2013 for a legal\u000a      and public audience at the Institute of Directors in London, organised by\u000a      the Middle Temple. He was invited to provide a voiceover for an internet\u000a      film (which included Olympic athletes) by the Guardian newspaper\u000a      ([9]; blog comment: `very professional; impressive...'). He was also\u000a      invited to produce a blog post for Cambridge Press, which had 6,225 unique\u000a      visits (11,050 total visits) by late October 2013, making it the 3rd\u000a      most popular blog post on the Cambridge Journals blog, of 260 posts across\u000a      all disciplines; the only posts with more visits were promotional posts\u000a      [7]. Carey also took part in a public discussion on sport at UCL with\u000a      celebrated neuroscientist Semir Zeki for an audience of 150. A video of\u000a      that discussion is now available online [8] and had received 900 views by\u000a      October 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at UCL has underpinned two significant activities which bring\u000a      our work to students, non-traditional learners and the wider world: the\u000a      UCL Greek play and the programme of events surrounding the London\u000a      Olympics. These exemplify the profound public impact of our research in\u000a      Greek performed poetry in its social context. Each year, almost 2,000\u000a      people attend the Greek play, along with workshops and lectures about\u000a      staging, interpretation, and the play's relationship to its social and\u000a      historical context.

The underpinning research base has been strengthened over the\u000a      last seven years by the powerful presence in the department of colleagues\u000a      researching the processes and theories of classical reception (And&#250;jar,\u000a      Leonard, Wyke). Their work has helped cement the diachronic sense of\u000a      impact on and in social, political and intellectual context(s) across time\u000a      and cultures.\u000a    Bakola's research at UCL has expanded our knowledge of fifth century\u000a      Athenian comedy as competition, politics, intertext and performance and\u000a      has been part of a major development (in which this department has played\u000a      a significant role) which uses lost texts and authors to reconstitute the\u000a      world of ancient theatre. She has shown the ways in which ideas of wealth\u000a      are linked in comedy and tragedy to the dynamics of social and political\u000a      change and to larger\/deeper (still live) issues of environment and man's\u000a      place in it [see b in section 3]. Carey has explored the complex fictive\u000a      world (especially in its political dimension) created by tragedy in the\u000a      imaginative and performative space between early Greek heroic epic and the\u000a      theatre of fifth century Athens [c], and the new use to which the athletic\u000a      victory song, originally destined for the elite of the Greek world, was\u000a      put in the performative context of the dramatic festivals of democratic\u000a      Athens [d]. The latter was included in a volume edited at UCL by Ag&#243;cs and\u000a      Carey with Richard Rawles, which traced the re-use of the victory ode in\u000a      contexts from fifth century Greece through Augustan Rome to Greek\u000a      independence and twentieth century Europe and America. Ag&#243;cs [a] examines\u000a      how the Pindaric victory ode fictionalises its own performance as\u000a      convivial procession (komos) within the fluid semantics of the term\u000a      and the larger cultural dynamics of performance modes.

Innovation and dissemination of new approaches in museology\u000d\u000a    Dissemination of Database and the Virtual Lightbox for Museums and\u000d\u000a        Archives (VLMA) Techniques\u000d\u000a      The VLMA project, which has been widely disseminated in conferences,\u000d\u000a      seminars and articles, introduced a new approach to encourage curators to\u000d\u000a      annotate, share and reuse museum data, including images, for the purposes\u000d\u000a      of education and research. It has had fundamental impact on the early\u000d\u000a      planning and development of major resources in the digital humanities in\u000d\u000a      the UK. The way the Ure's approach and its underlying database and\u000d\u000a      technology, radical at the time, informed the development and acceleration\u000d\u000a      of this trend is clearly shown by the Ure's acknowledged influence on\u000d\u000a      successor projects such as the development of the Oxford Virtual Resource\u000d\u000a      Environment (cf. http:\/\/www.oerc.ox.ac.uk\/image-library\/Kirkham.pdf)\u000d\u000a      and the Pliny platform at King's College London (cf. http:\/\/pliny.cch.kcl.ac.uk\/docs\/Illinois-Poster.pdf).\u000a      These kinds of accessible virtual platforms are now almost ubiquitous,\u000d\u000a      transforming museums, collections, and archives worldwide, extending to\u000d\u000a      major international institutions such as the British Museum and the J.\u000d\u000a      Paul Getty Museum. Smith was among the first who suggested (and, in\u000d\u000a      creating the Ure museum database, undertook) a digital overhaul of museum\u000d\u000a      database and curation systems.\u000d\u000a    Impact on artistic work and museology\u000d\u000a      The Ure database has been utilised by, and has informed, other museums and\u000d\u000a      artists, nationally and internationally. It was used, for example, in 2013\u000d\u000a      by staff of the Reading Museum (not affiliated to any university), both in\u000d\u000a      preparation of their current exhibit on `Greek vases in Reading' (http:\/\/www.readingmuseum.org.uk\/events\/details\/358\/)\u000d\u000a      (through November), which also incorporates 25 objects from the Ure (and\u000d\u000a      on which Smith was consulted) and it borrowed the UreView animations for\u000d\u000a      display in the Reading Museum and Town Hall.\u000d\u000a    The research that has resulted in the database, as well as the research\u000d\u000a      that the database itself has generated, has impacted directly on art, film\u000d\u000a      and blockbuster museum displays overseas, and it has thus unlocked the\u000d\u000a      huge potential of the Ure's collection to audiences which would otherwise\u000d\u000a      not have been reached. A highlight in that respect was the insights\u000d\u000a      generated by the Aphrodite Revealed conference (2008; see above,\u000d\u000a      Section 2), which had a significant impact on subsequent artistic work\u000d\u000a      carried out by a number of participants in the first conference, among\u000d\u000a      them the Greek and Roman curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, who\u000d\u000a      incorporated insights learned from the conference into her subsequent work\u000d\u000a      in creation a blockbuster museum exhibition &#8212; Aphrodite and the Gods\u000d\u000a        of Love &#8212; displayed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Getty\u000d\u000a      Museum and the San Antonio Museum of Art, published in a 2011 catalogue\u000d\u000a      (ISBN 9780878467563).\u000d\u000a    Integration into Larger Digital Library &#8212; Europeana and Pelagios\u000d\u000a      The Ure database also played an important role in the integration of\u000d\u000a      museum information into digital libraries of European Culture: from 2003\u000d\u000a      its data was incorporated into ECHO, an EU-funded project of MPIWG, and\u000d\u000a      when in 2006 the EU developed its own digital library of European Cultural\u000d\u000a      Heritage, Europeana (www.europeana.eu),\u000a      the Ure Museum was a founding member. Smith is also a member of\u000d\u000a      Europeana's Council of Content Providers, generating policy impact\u000d\u000a      stemming from the Ure's research work at an international level.\u000d\u000a    The VLMA technology and the Ure Database featured prominently in a\u000d\u000a      high-profile international project on geospatial data from antiquity in\u000d\u000a      2011. It is used by scholars and the general public to link artefacts to\u000d\u000a      geographical locations, and used the Ure Museum database to contribute to\u000d\u000a      its own records. (http:\/\/pelagios-project.blogspot.co.uk\/2011\/12\/converting-ure-museum-data.html).\u000d\u000a    Smith's museology research also contributed to a JISC-funded project,\u000d\u000a      OBL4HE (Object-based Learning for Higher Education), a partnership between\u000d\u000a      the University of Reading, University College London and the Collections\u000d\u000a      Trust, which developed a series of online resources, as highlighted at\u000d\u000a\u0009  http:\/\/blogs.reading.ac.uk\/engage-in-teaching-and-learning\/2013\/01\/25\/students-like-live-lectures-and-online-ones-as-backup-by-rebecca-reynolds\/\u000d\u000a      About 6,500 objects and archive documents were digitised and put with\u000d\u000a      already digitised sources to create a source base of about 150,000 digital\u000d\u000a      assets. Seventeen open access e-learning resources based on these were\u000d\u000a      developed.\u000d\u000a    2. Direct Impact on educational resources and pedagogy:\u000d\u000a    The purpose in presenting the museum's data to the public is to allow its\u000d\u000a      use and reuse in whatever way suits their learning interests and styles.\u000d\u000a      Smith and her colleagues have created substantial impact by means of\u000d\u000a      disseminating and encouraging reuse of this data among as wide an audience\u000d\u000a      as possible:\u000d\u000a    Impact on school groups and the general public through improvement to\u000d\u000a        the Ure Museum.\u000d\u000a      The database developed by Smith enabled the Museum to better inform\u000d\u000a      visitors of the content and significance of the items they were viewing.\u000d\u000a      During the REF cycle the Museum has hosted about 4,000 pupils and teachers\u000d\u000a      from 54 schools for formal group activities; public family events for a\u000d\u000a      total of c.2,000 young visitors; adult visit events for a total of\u000d\u000a      c.6,000 visitors; and seminars and colloquia for c.2,500\u000d\u000a      visitors. Feedback from these activities has been overwhelmingly positive:\u000d\u000a    \"Last year you kindly invited us to the museum and put on a fabulous\u000d\u000a      workshop and gave the children an opportunity to look at the artefacts on\u000d\u000a      display.

Smith and her co-organisers published select contributions from\u000d\u000a      their proceedings (see Section 3, below).\u000d\u000a    Since 2001, the Ure Museum has also taken a leading position in\u000d\u000a      implementing new technologies by developing and publishing digital\u000d\u000a      resources. The Virtual Lightbox for Museums and Archives (VLMA), was\u000d\u000a      developed as a JISC e-learning tool, in 2004-5. The image manipulation\u000d\u000a      segments of the VLMA source code are based on the Virtual Lightbox\u000d\u000a      (created by the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities). It\u000d\u000a      was developed in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for the\u000d\u000a      History of Science (Berlin) and later with Oxford Archaeology, and was of\u000d\u000a      particular importance for impact-bearing activities, as it firmly\u000d\u000a      established Smith's leading role in the creation of high-end digital\u000d\u000a      resources for the museum sector. Smith has published on the VLMA (see\u000d\u000a      Section 3, below), and has thus been able to develop an outstanding track\u000d\u000a      record of impactful digital work (see Section 4, below).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40324","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Education: enriching students' appreciation of the interpretative\u000a        nature of history Educational impact has always been the main focus\u000a      of the project [a]. Initial scoping demonstrations in Phase 1 (2008\/9)\u000a      involved five teachers and 100 Year 9 students across three schools. As a\u000a      result of noting the potential to link the project to the then emerging\u000a      Personal Learning and Thinking Skills (PLTS) which schools were to be\u000a      required to assess and blend into the curriculum, Chantry High School, a\u000a      mid-sized comprehensive in Ipswich, became the team's partners in:\u000a    \u000a      creating and evaluating a package of learning activities for a\u000a        ten-hour Humanities programme using Bristol's virtual model to deliver\u000a        PLTS objectives [b].\u000a      developing a prototype product\/service which could be made safe and\u000a        accessible to all schools and universities through migration from Second\u000a        Life (SL) to Open Sim.\u000a    \u000a    In phase 2 (2010 onwards), the team has extended the trial, involving\u000a      demonstrations at two Bristol schools (Cotham and Red Maids', 80-plus\u000a      students), trials with sample groups at three schools (St Mary Redcliffe\u000a      and Temple (SMRT), Fairfield High and Redland Green, 60-plus students,\u000a      2012\/13) and pedagogical discussions with local History and Classics\u000a      teachers. They have also taken opportunities to promote the project across\u000a      the country, for example presenting at a teaching-enrichment day at North\u000a      London Collegiate Schools (2013) and various educational conferences (see\u000a      section 2). In order to evaluate educational impact, the researchers\u000a      gather data through observation [b], group discussion with students and\u000a      teachers during and after sessions [c], written feedback gathered from\u000a      students and quantitative data collected using voting technology.\u000a    The significant impact and benefits to the students have been:\u000a    \u000a      Helping students grasp the contingent nature of `interpretations' of\u000a        the past &#8212; that is to say, understanding the part that reception plays\u000a        in the construction of historical interpretation and narrative. This is\u000a        particularly demonstrated by class discussions at SMRT, in which\u000a        students talked about how their concept of history and historical `fact'\u000a        had changed, noting, for example, `I find it quite annoying when someone\u000a        tells us that this IS what happened'; `it gives you the challenge to\u000a        peel back the layers of history... even if it gives you less of an\u000a        insight into the actual event, it can give you more of an insight on the\u000a        previous group of people looking at the event'': [c]. One student even\u000a        remarked when realising that what might be presented as historical facts\u000a        can be unreliable and open to interpretation, `It's quite scary'. All\u000a        groups were able to transfer this experience to other periods of history\u000a        they had studied. The SMRT team noted that the project `was able to\u000a        facilitate a debate which demonstrated thinking and reasoning skills of\u000a        a standard I have rarely seen at Key Stage 3' [d]. Commenting straight\u000a        after the lesson the teacher said `That activity on its own is\u000a        brilliant... I can't think of anything else you could use to do it' [c].\u000a      Helping students appreciate how past events impact on the present:\u000a        students were able to reflect on the ways in which issues they had\u000a        learned about in the study of Victorian Britain might have been\u000a        influenced by ancient practice &#8212; for instance and in particular,\u000a        slavery. Students enjoyed the opportunity to find out more about periods\u000a        they felt they knew little about beforehand, and in this sense\u000a        particularly, this project's blend of the Victorian and the Roman\u000a        allowed students to learn more about Classics than would ever be the\u000a        case on the standard curriculum [b].\u000a      Establishing a `sense of period' to provide context for larger\u000a        historical questions, particularly through the walk-through timeline\u000a        along which students first travel to the model (reckoned to have `vast\u000a        potential for the teaching of chronology' [e]) and attitudes and\u000a        experiences voiced by robot avatars. The behaviour of students adopting\u000a        the character of the period avatars they were given, included texting in\u000a        `Victorian-ese' [b] and inventing informed back stories about\u000a        characters' relationships. Students particularly identified with\u000a        experiences of status and gender discrimination their characters\u000a        suffered at the hand of robot avatars [c] and Fairfield High found this\u000a        the `most useful' part of the experience [f].\u000a      Giving enhanced opportunities for self-development through the\u000a        opportunity to experience a historical context for themselves. Redland\u000a        Green noted that the model's environment `lends itself to independent\u000a        learning brilliantly' [e]. At Chantry, the team noted that the different\u000a        mode of delivery and familiarity with technology engaged a number of\u000a        boys who were usually reluctant to get involved in class [b]. One boy at\u000a        SMRT said, `this project has allowed me to come out of my shell a bit\u000a        more and it's given me more confidence' [c]. Another reflected on a\u000a        life-lesson learned: `you've got to make your own decision. You can't\u000a        just let people give it to you and just take it because they might have\u000a        manipulated it. You need to decide for yourself what you think' [c].\u000a    \u000a    In July 2013, the team met with the teachers involved in the Bristol\u000a      trials, and some interested future partners, to share experiences and\u000a      discuss ways to develop a genuinely collaborative teaching and learning\u000a      package. All teachers thought that their students had benefited from\u000a      participation and that their own aims had been met. There was great\u000a      enthusiasm for continued involvement in the project. Some particular\u000a      avenues for further exploration include:\u000a    \u000a      Redland Green, SMRT and new partner Cathedral School are especially\u000a        interested in using the online environment as a space 'for developing\u000a        opportunities for valuable cross-school collaboration' [d]; a feature\u000a        that `other teachers would surely be interested in' [e].\u000a      Red Maids' are predominantly interested in the development of the\u000a        model specifically to serve the module on Roman domestic space in GCSE\u000a        Classical Civilisations. They feel that it could serve as an `excellent\u000a        learning tool' in helping students explore the space of the Roman house\u000a        and furthermore better equip them with the skills to answer examination\u000a        questions which often ask students to `imagine' life in Pompeii [g].\u000a      Fairfield High have offered ideas for developing material that would\u000a        help extend the project from its focus audience of school students\u000a        following Gifted and Talented programmes to meet the needs of the trial\u000a        group with which the team worked there, predominantly `pupil premium\u000a        students' and `students with English as an additional language', thus\u000a        extending its impact through the school-age population of the city [f].\u000a    \u000a    Heritage: supporting activities of local heritage groups in promoting\u000a        awareness of and access to archive material and knowledge pertaining to\u000a        the Crystal Palace\u000a    Since the dissolution of the GLC, there has been little investment in the\u000a      Crystal Palace Park. In 2008, the London Development Agency produced a\u000a      white paper on the future of the park, and the Bristol project was named\u000a      as a possible partner in the development of an interpretation strategy\u000a      [h]. A much pared-down masterplan was approved in December 2010 but, due\u000a      to financial concerns, it is yet to be effected.\u000a    As a result, a DVD of Bristol's model for display in the small,\u000a      volunteer-run and donation-funded Crystal Palace Museum, which attracts\u000a      8,000 visitors annually, provides an immediate impact. The video\u000a      fly-through, installed in 2013, is the only visualisation of the interior\u000a      of the lost Palace. It will have educational benefit to local schools, who\u000a      use the Museum as a resource for local history, and to visitors. It will\u000a      assist local amateur societies in their endeavours to develop the displays\u000a      at the Park and in other ways (e.g., by a mobile phone app). The Director\u000a      of the Museum and its trustees wrote that they are `so impressed with your\u000a      efforts to date to do something that no one else has achieved'. They have\u000a      been extremely supportive of the project throughout, sharing archive\u000a      material and discussing ideas for taking our partnership forward through\u000a      further collaboration on display material [i].\u000a    Online Presence and Dissemination: the presence of the Bristol team's\u000a        outputs on various online platforms has disseminated awareness of the\u000a        Palace and of the project's contents and aims to a global audience and\u000a        has contributed to wider online debates about, for example, the presence\u000a        of educational sims in Second Life.\u000a    The team have endeavoured to extend the reach of the project through\u000a      dissemination in a number of media. The project has been covered by local\u000a      press, appearing in the Bristol Evening Post, Ipswich Evening\u000a        Star and Crystal Palace News (online newsletter).The team\u000a      has presented its work at a number of public events, including university\u000a      public engagement activities, talks to special-interest groups, and\u000a      large-scale public events such as the Crystal Palace Arts Festival 2009\u000a      and Discover 2010. In 2012, the researchers were invited to California to\u000a      speak about their model at the Getty Museum as part of a public engagement\u000a      day promoting its exhibition, The Last Days of Pompeii, to 600\u000a      ticket-holders. The model in SL is permanently open to online users and\u000a      two videos (one of them the video made for the Museum) are available on\u000a      YouTube and our website. Although the researchers cannot track visitor\u000a      numbers to the online model per se, the optional virtual guide has been\u000a      downloaded more than 2,760 times. Interest among the SL community is\u000a      indicated by repeated reference to Bristol's project in blogs such as Prim\u000a        Perfect (which has featured the project three times), particularly\u000a      with regard to the debate about the difficulties of sustaining educational\u000a      presence in a commercial environment like SL, and by the dedication of an\u000a      episode of Designing Worlds on Treet TV (SL TV station) to the\u000a      Bristol model [j]. Over 8,000 people visited the project blog over three\u000a      years and 65 engaged comments from readers in the UK, US and Europe were\u000a      live on the website on 31st July 2013 [a].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Hundreds of school students, their teachers, local heritage groups,\u000a      audiences at live events and thousands of people engaging in online\u000a      activities have benefited from a University of Bristol research project\u000a      called Resurrecting the Past: Virtual Antiquities in the Nineteenth\u000a      Century. The project uses the medium of a 3D online model of the Pompeian\u000a      Court of the Crystal Palace to promote awareness of the Palace and provide\u000a      access to knowledge about it. Just as significantly, the project has\u000a      explored how history is interpreted and inspired innovative ways of\u000a      teaching. The research has not only illuminated a particular place and\u000a      period but also investigated the relationships between 19th-century\u000a      physical and 21st-century virtual reconstruction.

Her work on reception focuses particularly on\u000a      19th-century reconstructions of Pompeian houses.

Its greatest innovation was to achieve these aims\u000a      through reconstruction and as such was an early experiment in the ways in\u000a      which reconstruction might serve entertainment, education and research and\u000a      make the past accessible to wide audiences. Its series of courts\u000a      showcasing past civilizations included a replica Pompeian house which was\u000a      destroyed when the Palace burnt down in 1936.\u000a    The research\u000a    Dr Hales' interest in exploring these values of reconstruction led her to\u000a      collaborate with Dr Nic Earle (e-Learning Co-ordinator in Bristol's\u000a      Education Support Unit) to found the research project, Resurrecting the\u000a      Past: Virtual Antiquities in the Nineteenth Century, in 2008. The project\u000a      explores reconstruction, both as a Victorian and contemporary practice,\u000a      through the creation of a 3D, online virtual model of the Pompeian Court.\u000a      The model interacts with, rather than simply presents, the Victorians' own\u000a      attempt to visualise Pompeii, by mimicking, critiquing and comparing it\u000a      with today's technologies, museological attitudes and learning theories.\u000a      As well as providing an environment in which to conduct research, the\u000a      model acts as an online archive of the contents of and sources pertaining\u000a      to the Court and as an interactive environment, populated with information\u000a      and robot characters, with which to engage audiences.\u000a    Phase 1 (October 2008-September 2009) was funded by JISC's `Enhancing\u000a      Digital Collections' programme.

This is a very rural\u000d\u000a      area: the main activities are agriculture and animal husbandry. The\u000d\u000a      village has two sawmills (each\u000d\u000a      employing about 6 people), two small caf&#233;s, two small stores selling\u000d\u000a      household goods, and two\u000d\u000a      eateries. According to recent census reports, 10% of the village is\u000d\u000a      illiterate, and most of those who\u000d\u000a      are illiterate are women. Of those who are literate, many attained\u000d\u000a      education only at primary school\u000d\u000a      level. Before our activities described below, many of the villagers had\u000d\u000a      never attended educational\u000d\u000a      talks, seen exhibitions, or handled archaeological materials. Between 2008\u000d\u000a      and 2012, Momigliano\u000d\u000a      organised 3 public meetings, interviews, and a poster exhibition in the\u000d\u000a      village to explain the nature\u000d\u000a      of &#199;AP's work, share preliminary results, and answer questions.\u000d\u000a      Approximately 80 people\u000d\u000a      (including many women and children) attended each of the public meetings\u000d\u000a      (2008, 2009, 2012),\u000d\u000a      and the exhibition attracted over 150 visitors between 2 and 11 August\u000d\u000a      2012 [a]. In addition,\u000d\u000a      interviews were held in &#199;alt&#305;lar in 2010 and 2012 with individuals and\u000d\u000a      various focus groups (ca. 50\u000d\u000a      people were involved in this activity) to gather information about the\u000d\u000a      villagers' attitudes to their local\u000d\u000a      heritage and the impact of the &#199;AP's activities on those attitudes [b].\u000d\u000a      These interviews\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that villagers have acquired much new knowledge about their\u000d\u000a      local history and also\u000d\u000a      changed their perceptions of archaeology: they now take more pride in\u000d\u000a      their local history and,\u000d\u000a      instead of simply destroying archaeological finds through agricultural\u000d\u000a      activities without further ado,\u000d\u000a      are more likely to report their existence to archaeologists, as indeed the\u000d\u000a      &#199;AP's team were able to\u000d\u000a      experience at first hand. For example, a 32-year old female remarked that\u000d\u000a      her visit to the visitor\u000d\u000a      centre was her first exposure to a museum or archaeological exhibition of\u000d\u000a      any kind. A 60-year old\u000d\u000a      male farmer highlighted how &#199;AP had developed his awareness of his\u000d\u000a      cultural heritage, which\u000d\u000a      prompted him to ask specifically that the archaeological finds remain in\u000d\u000a      Turkey [b].\u000d\u000a    ii) Influencing design and delivery of education in museums\/schools\u000d\u000a      Momigliano achieved this through 1) advising local museum officials; 2)\u000d\u000a      creating a visitor centre\u000d\u000a      and other facilities at &#199;alt&#305;lar; and 3) producing information and\u000d\u000a      materials to be used in teaching by\u000d\u000a      museum staff in local schools [c, d]. More specifically, &#199;AP was\u000d\u000a      instrumental in the successful\u000d\u000a      joint application to the EU by the Fethiye Museum and Liverpool Victoria\u000d\u000a      Gallery and Museum for\u000d\u000a      their `Illuminating the Land of Light' educational project (ILL) in 2012,\u000d\u000a      as confirmed by the Fethiye\u000d\u000a      Museum director [c]. This project, funded by the EU-Turkish\u000d\u000a      Intercultural Dialogue Museum\u000d\u000a      Donation Programme aims to increase public awareness of cultural heritage\u000d\u000a      through educational\u000d\u000a      activities for 2,000 students in primary education and 500 students in\u000d\u000a      secondary education from\u000d\u000a      schools both in Fethiye and near significant historical sites, as Kamil\u000d\u000a      &#214;zer, the Mu&#287;la Director of\u000d\u000a      Culture and Tourism, explained in a local newspaper [j].\u000d\u000a      Momigliano was engaged in the early\u000d\u000a      stages of this project's design and, because of &#199;AP's research, &#199;alt&#305;lar\u000d\u000a      is the only pre-Classical\u000d\u000a      site that has been included in this educational programme [d].\u000d\u000a      Momigliano also started renovations\u000d\u000a      of two abandoned schools in &#199;alt&#305;lar village for research and educational\u000d\u000a      purposes, after being\u000d\u000a      granted permission by the local authorities in September 2009. The\u000d\u000a      renovation of one school as a\u000d\u000a      visitor centre and the restoration of a traditional Lycian wooden granary\u000d\u000a      (ambar) were completed in\u000d\u000a      2012, and these facilities have been made available to other\u000d\u000a      projects\/institutions (including the ILL\u000d\u000a      project), together with other materials (photos, posters from the\u000d\u000a      aforementioned exhibition, and\u000d\u000a      publications), so that thousands of schoolchildren in the whole of the\u000d\u000a      Fethiye district will obtain a\u000d\u000a      deeper understanding of their local history, now extending to the\u000d\u000a      Chalcolithic and Bronze Age\u000d\u000a      periods thanks to &#199;AP's discoveries [c, d]. The Fethiye Museum\u000d\u000a      Director commented that &#199;AP\u000d\u000a      `has made a most valuable contribution to our own educational programme\u000d\u000a      [ILL project] ...[whilst\u000d\u000a      the] restoration of the schools and of the ambar has already made an\u000d\u000a      impact on the local\u000d\u000a      community level, and will continue to make a practical and substantial\u000d\u000a      difference for years to\u000d\u000a      come.' [c].\u000d\u000a    iii) Contributing to personal and professional development\u000d\u000a      Students from other UK and Turkish universities were trained in a variety\u000d\u000a      of archaeological\u000d\u000a      activities including: artefact drawing and photography; use of computer\u000d\u000a      programmes (excel and\u000d\u000a      access databases); use of electronic equipment for topographical survey\u000d\u000a      and geophysics;\u000d\u000a      systematic artefact surface collection. In addition, they had to develop\u000d\u000a      teamwork skills, as required\u000d\u000a      by most of the project's activities. Some of these Turkish students have\u000d\u000a      now obtained bursaries to\u000d\u000a      conduct postgraduate studies in Turkey and in the UK (acknowledging the\u000d\u000a      importance of their\u000d\u000a      experience at &#199;alt&#305;lar) [e] whilst a former Bristol student\u000d\u000a      (employed by Suffolk County Council\u000d\u000a      Archaeological Services since 2009) has used materials from &#199;AP to compete\u000d\u000a      successfully in a\u000d\u000a      world-wide photography competition (www.world-archaeology.com\/news\/photo-competition\/).\u000d\u000a    iv) Providing temporary employment and economic benefits to local\u000d\u000a        people\u000d\u000a      &#199;AP contributed to the local and regional economic growth by providing\u000d\u000a      employment for up to 8\u000d\u000a      local people during the field-seasons and through other expenditure\u000d\u000a      supporting archaeological\u000d\u000a      work (such as car and house rental, etc.) amounting to several thousands\u000d\u000a      of GBP each season [f].\u000d\u000a      &#199;AP has also had an impact on the village's infrastructure through the\u000d\u000a      aforementioned restorations\u000d\u000a      (schools and granary), which involved the employment of builders,\u000d\u000a      plumbers, electricians,\u000d\u000a      ironmongers, and carpenters. Expenses for these restorations alone so far\u000d\u000a      have amounted to\u000d\u000a      about &#163;9000. For comparative purposes, a typical worker's monthly salary\u000d\u000a      in this part of Turkey is\u000d\u000a      about &#163;300.\u000d\u000a    v) Developing stimuli to tourism and contributing to the quality of\u000d\u000a        the tourist experience.\u000d\u000a      &#199;AP's research activities have attracted visitors who would not have\u000d\u000a      normally come to this rural\u000d\u000a      area of SW Turkey. For example, in 2009 a small group of Bristol\u000d\u000a      University Alumni (9 people) and,\u000d\u000a      in 2012, various politicians (a group of 20), journalists, and TV\u000d\u000a      reporters (4) visited &#199;alt&#305;lar. After\u000d\u000a      the politicians', journalists', and TV reporters' visits, reports appeared\u000d\u000a      in local and national\u000d\u000a      newspapers, and TV programmes, including Sabah (a national daily\u000d\u000a      newspaper), which has a\u000d\u000a      circulation of more than 300,000 and TRT the national public broadcaster\u000d\u000a      of Turkey [g, h, i]. One\u000d\u000a      online version of the TRT television programme has been watched 186,340\u000d\u000a      times (as of 1\u000d\u000a      November 2013) [i]. This was the first time that &#199;alt&#305;lar had ever\u000d\u000a      appeared in national newspapers\u000d\u000a      and on TV programmes, as a direct result of &#199;AP's activities, and this was\u000d\u000a      considered a source of\u000d\u000a      pride and potential economic benefit by &#199;alt&#305;lar's villagers themselves [b]\u000d\u000a      because, thanks to this\u000d\u000a      publicity, more people are now aware of this village and will visit it in\u000d\u000a      the future. The visitor centre\u000d\u000a      and poster exhibition contributed to the quality of the tourist\u000d\u000a      experience, offering intellectual\u000d\u000a      stimulation. The poster exhibition was also shown in October 2012 at the\u000d\u000a      cultural festival of\u000d\u000a      &#214;l&#252;deniz (near Fethiye), one of the most famous tourist resorts in Turkey\u000d\u000a      (tourists come to Fethiye\u000d\u000a      and its beach resorts throughout the year, and from all over the world,\u000d\u000a      but mostly from the UK,\u000d\u000a      Russia, Germany, and Turkey). About 150 people attended this opening,\u000d\u000a      which was also reported\u000d\u000a      in the local press [h]. Another exhibition of these posters is\u000d\u000a      planned in Fethiye in the winter of\u000d\u000a      2013\/14 by a local tourist agency in collaboration with the local Rotary\u000d\u000a      Club, providing further\u000d\u000a      contribution to the quality of the tourist experience.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Between 2008 and 2012 the &#199;alt&#305;lar Archaeological Project (&#199;AP\u000d\u000a      henceforth) produced\u000d\u000a      intellectual, social, and economic benefits to a variety of social groups\u000d\u000a      (including groups not\u000d\u000a      normally engaged in educational activities) through the following means:\u000d\u000a      i) conserving, presenting,\u000d\u000a      and developing awareness of cultural heritage as well as changing\u000d\u000a      knowledge of and attitudes\u000d\u000a      towards archaeological heritage in particular (2008-2012; ii) influencing\u000d\u000a      design and delivery of\u000d\u000a      education in museums and schools (through advisory roles, creation and\u000d\u000a      sharing of facilities,\u000d\u000a      provision of materials used in teaching) (2010-2012); iii) contributing to\u000d\u000a      the personal and\u000d\u000a      professional development of individuals (training Turkish and UK students\u000d\u000a      in archaeological and\u000d\u000a      transferable skills enhancing their academic careers and employability)\u000d\u000a      (2008-2012); iv) providing\u000d\u000a      temporary employment and economic benefits for local people (2008-2012);\u000d\u000a      v) developing stimuli\u000d\u000a      to tourism and contributing to the quality of the tourist experience\u000d\u000a      (2012).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Bristol\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"304183","Name":"Mugla"},{"GeoNamesId":"314967","Name":"Fethiye"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] N.

Momigliano initiated the\u000d\u000a      project, directed it, and\u000d\u000a      obtained most of the funding (approximately 95%), which enabled both\u000d\u000a      research and related\u000d\u000a      outreach activities described below. Momigliano was involved in a leading\u000d\u000a      role in all the project's\u000d\u000a      activities, from writing applications to devising the fieldwork strategy,\u000d\u000a      from collecting archaeological\u000d\u000a      artefacts in the field to processing and studying these finds, and from\u000d\u000a      writing reports to creating\u000d\u000a      posters for an exhibition. In particular, she contributed to the study and\u000d\u000a      publication of the\u000d\u000a      prehistoric (Chalcolithic-Bronze Age) aspects of the project.\u000d\u000a    The overall research aims of &#199;AP were: 1) to provide new knowledge on the\u000d\u000a      settlement history,\u000d\u000a      environment, and material culture of Pre-Classical northern Lycia (SW\u000d\u000a      Turkey) from ca. 4000-600\u000d\u000a      BC; and 2) to explore the role of this region within the context of\u000d\u000a      broader Eastern Mediterranean-Anatolian-Aegean\u000d\u000a      interactions in these early periods. These aims were accomplished through\u000d\u000a      systematic archaeological surveys at Eceler and, especially, &#199;alt&#305;lar\u000d\u000a      H&#246;y&#252;k, two sites located in the\u000d\u000a      upland region of the Xanthus river valley, near the town of Seki and the\u000d\u000a      village of &#199;alt&#305;lar.\u000d\u000a    This region is part of the land of Lukka referred to in many Egyptian,\u000d\u000a      Hittite, and Ugaritic\u000d\u000a      documents of the mid-late 2nd millennium BC. Lycian heroes are\u000d\u000a      also mentioned in the early 1st\u000d\u000a      millennium Homeric poems. Very little, however, is known about the actual\u000d\u000a      settlement history and\u000d\u000a      material culture of this region before the Classical period, because, so\u000d\u000a      far, archaeological\u000d\u000a      explorations have focused on later prominent Graeco-Roman cities, such as\u000d\u000a      Oinoanda and\u000d\u000a      Balboura, and their epigraphic legacy.\u000d\u000a    Between 2008 and 2012 systematic investigations were carried out under\u000d\u000a      the direction of\u000d\u000a      Momigliano at the sites of at &#199;alt&#305;lar and Eceler [1-4]. This work\u000d\u000a      included topographical surveys,\u000d\u000a      intensive archaeological surveys, geophysical surveys, a survey of re-used\u000d\u000a      ancient materials at\u000d\u000a      &#199;alt&#305;lar village, as well as geomorphological and ethno-archaeological\u000d\u000a      investigations (the latter\u000d\u000a      involving preliminary studies of modern traditional pottery production\u000d\u000a      which will be published in\u000d\u000a      2015).\u000d\u000a    This research produced much new evidence regarding the history of\u000d\u000a      occupation in this area. It\u000d\u000a      suggests that &#199;alt&#305;lar is the most important pre-Classical settlement\u000d\u000a      located within the territories of\u000d\u000a      the Classical cities of Balboura and Oinoanda, especially in the Bronze\u000d\u000a      Age period (3rd-2nd\u000d\u000a      millennia BC) &#8212; Momigliano's main field of research. Momigliano, in\u000d\u000a      particular, has identified for\u000d\u000a      the first time material evidence of occupation in this area during the 2nd\u000d\u000a      millennium BC, some of\u000d\u000a      which may be contemporary with the aforementioned Egyptian, Hittite, and\u000d\u000a      Ugaritic documents\u000d\u000a      [see esp. 1, 4; further publication forthcoming in 2014].\u000d\u000a    The project has also provided considerable new information on the\u000d\u000a      material culture typical of this\u000d\u000a      upland area from c.4000- 600 BC, and on the long-distance interactions\u000d\u000a      between &#199;alt&#305;lar and other\u000d\u000a      regions, especially for the Early Bronze Age and Middle-Late Iron Age. For\u000d\u000a      example, analysis of\u000d\u000a      an Early Bronze Age obsidian object found at &#199;alt&#305;lar showed that it\u000d\u000a      originated from Nenezi Da&#287; in\u000d\u000a      southern Cappadocia, some 460 km to the northeast; some of the Early\u000d\u000a      Bronze Age ceramics\u000d\u000a      appear to be imports from areas beyond the Seki basin\/upper Xanthus valley\u000d\u000a      (possibly originating\u000d\u000a      from the Elmal&#305; and the Menderes massif areas); and significant amounts of\u000d\u000a      Iron Age pottery have\u000d\u000a      been identified as imports from other Turkish regions (e.g. Phrygia and\u000d\u000a      Caria) as well as from the\u000d\u000a      Aegean islands and mainland Greece [see esp. 1] The research has\u000d\u000a      been disseminated to\u000d\u000a      scholarly audiences in peer-reviewed journals, edited volumes, lectures,\u000d\u000a      seminars, and\u000d\u000a      proceedings of international conferences for Turkish archaeology (see\u000d\u000a      examples in section 3).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40326","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Reception is a major part of what Classicists do nowadays compared to\u000a      twenty years ago. Bristol\u000a      has been a leading player in this trend from the start, in its research,\u000a      teaching and institutional\u000a      arrangements. Throughout the REF period, and long before, it has been\u000a      standard practice in the\u000a      department to share our work with the public, principally through the\u000a      Bristol Institute of Greece,\u000a      Rome and the Classical Tradition [a] and its predecessor the\u000a      Centre for the Classical Tradition.\u000a      The Institute supports research into any aspect of Greco-Roman\u000a      civilisation, but places particular\u000a      emphasis on the links that bind the ancient and modern worlds. 9 of its 15\u000a      postdoctoral fellows\u000a      have done research on reception. In the REF period it sponsored 45 events,\u000a      many of them\u000a      extending over several days ([b]). Of these, 33 were on reception\u000a      topics. The public is invited as a\u000a      matter of course but they are most in evidence at the two annual\u000a      showcases, the Blackwell-Bristol\u000a      Lectures (four lectures annually since 2008) and the annual Donors' Event.\u000a      The Lectures and the\u000a      Donors' Event consistently attract audiences of between 50 and 100 people\u000a      including many people\u000a      from outside the University. At the Donors' Event, a public thank-you to\u000a      supporters, some aspect of\u000a      the Institute's current research is presented in a way that is accessible\u000a      yet without sacrificing\u000a      academic quality. Three of the Donors' Events have highlighted the\u000a      research programmes\u000a      mentioned above: `Milton at 400', 12 November 2008, with papers from\u000a      Martindale and Hopkins of\u000a      Bristol, and S. Brown of Anglia Ruskin (former Bristol undergraduate and\u000a      postgraduate); `Greece\u000a      and Rome in Silent Cinema', 3 December 2011 (speakers Michelakis and Wyke,\u000a      featuring excerpts\u000a      from films and live, improvised piano accompaniment); `Constitutionalism:\u000a      Ancient, Modern and\u000a      American', 8 December 2012 (speaker P. Rahe, Hillsdale College, Michigan;\u000a      the lecture was part\u000a      of a meeting of the Legacy of Greek Political Thought network, hosted by\u000a      Morley in the context of\u000a      the Thucydides project). All of these events contribute to the public\u000a      understanding of classical\u000a      reception, linking directly to longstanding core research of the Bristol\u000a      department.\u000a    Feedback from these events is consistently enthusiastic (and audiences\u000a      keep returning).\u000a      Comments are often heard, particularly from alumni, about the change in\u000a      Classics since their day\u000a      and about how reception studies have vastly expanded the subject's reach\u000a      and their own\u000a      appreciation of it. Perhaps the most tangible and persuasive evidence of\u000a      impact is that people are\u000a      inspired to donate financially. Operating costs of the Institute, which in\u000a      the REF period has raised\u000a      &#163;422,000, are met entirely from charitable donations from individuals and\u000a      corporations. A typical\u000a      supporter writes that the work of the Institute has \"broadened my\u000a      horizons\" and \"educated me in an\u000a      area of which I knew little... I am sufficiently impressed with what has\u000a      been achieved and is\u000a      planned to be achieved to want to help fund the work, which I have just\u000a      done for this academic\u000a      year\". The Institute receives annual donations of approximately &#163;15,000\u000a      from individuals; we have\u000a      also had an individual gift of &#163;100,000 and another of &#163;50,000. The A.G.\u000a      Leventis Foundation\u000a      acknowledges the Institute's distinctive approach and commitment to the\u000a      classical tradition as a\u000a      reason for its ongoing and substantial support.\u000a    The second aspect of impact in this case study is the way reception is\u000a      now embedded in the\u000a      curricula of classics departments. A survey of teaching carried out by the\u000a      Classical Reception\u000a      Studies Network found that 18 of 23 departments in the country offered\u000a      reception-focused\u000a      undergraduate modules (41 between them) in 2008-09 and a further 45\u000a      modules that had a\u000a      significant element of reception. 5-10 students every year in these\u000a      departments write a final-year\u000a      dissertation on a reception theme. One-third of departments see reception\u000a      as integral to the\u000a      curriculum, not an add-on ([c]). This is a complete transformation\u000a      of the pedagogical landscape.\u000a      Bristol, being among the first to develop this approach, has been a leader\u000a      in effecting this change.\u000a      In the nature of things such indirect causal links are hard to prove, but\u000a      the close association of\u000a      Bristol Classics and reception is long-standing and acknowledged\u000a      nationally and internationally. As\u000a      a concrete example we offer the impact of Martindale's Redeeming the\u000a        Text. A special issue of the\u000a      Classical Receptions Journal (5.2, 2013) marked the 20th\u000a      anniversary of its publication and\u000a      includes a chapter on teaching in which the author, a scholar teaching in\u000a      Vassar College,\u000a      acknowledges Martindale's decisive influence ([d]). Recent\u000a      testimonials from both sides of the\u000a      Atlantic assert that Martindale `led and did not simply contribute to the\u000a      trend of reception study'\u000a      ([e]); that Redeeming the Text is `one of the most\u000a      important and influential books in classical\u000a      reception studies' whose teaching would look `very different' without it ([f]);\u000a      that the book has been\u000a      `utterly formative' of the author's teaching ([g]); that the change\u000a      in classical pedagogy `is in no\u000a      small part due to the echo Martindale's work has had' [h]); that\u000a      it has `helped to reconfigure the\u000a      modern discipline of Classics', and is a `permanent fixture on the\u000a      critical bibliography of key works'\u000a      given to students [i]. This colleague also refers to a panel on\u000a      teaching classical receptions at the\u000a      2013 meeting of the American Philological Association, where Redeeming\u000a        the Text began the\u000a      discussion. `It is no exaggeration to say,' this colleague concludes,\u000a      `that all my teaching in Classical\u000a      Reception Studies is in dialogue with RTT.'\u000a    Reception studies are inherently interdisciplinary, aiming to equip\u000a      students with a broad outlook\u000a      and the skills needed to pursue further work. They also lead readily to an\u000a      engagement with the\u000a      world outside the academy and an enhanced awareness of the historical\u000a      environment. Apart from\u000a      the purely academic rewards offered by reception studies, they have proven\u000a      a highly successful\u000a      response in educational terms to changing circumstances, refreshing our\u000a      curricula, forging links\u000a      with the whole range of arts and humanities, and underscoring the\u000a      continuing relevance of Classics\u000a      and Ancient History.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Bristol department of Classics and Ancient History has long been well\u000a      known for its work on\u000a      the reception of antiquity.

This has been\u000a      a dominant focus since\u000a      the early 1990s, leading first to the foundation of the Centre for the\u000a      Classical Tradition and then of\u000a      its successor the Bristol Institute of Greece, Rome and the Classical\u000a      Tradition (BIGRCT, founded\u000a      in 2000). The research has been both theoretical, with ground-breaking\u000a      studies defining the\u000a      concepts and models of reception, and empirical, with substantial work\u000a      devoted to nineteenth-century\u000a\u0009  Britain, modernism, film and other areas. Some specific outputs\u000a      are highlighted here. For\u000a      general influence pride of place goes to C. Martindale's Redeeming the\u000a        Text: Latin Poetry and the\u000a        Hermeneutics of Reception (1993) [1] (Martindale was at\u000a      Bristol from 1990-2013). A programmatic\u000a      manifesto, it is one of the most important books in the field. It lays out\u000a      a (for the time) radical\u000a      hermeneutics based on the reception theories of Wolfgang Iser and\u000a      Hans-Robert Jauss. Volume\u000a      5.2 of The Classical Receptions Journal (2013) was devoted\u000a      entirely to an assessment of the\u000a      impact of this work, twenty years on. Another pioneering project in the\u000a      mid 1990s was `Receptions\u000a      of Rome', a three-year, Leverhulme-funded research project (&#163;100,000) led\u000a      by Martindale and C.\u000a      Edwards (then at Bristol). A major exhibition at the Bristol City Museum\u000a      and Art Gallery 3 May-23\u000a      June 1996 was part of the project; alongside the exhibition catalogue, the\u000a      edited volume Roman\u000a        Presences [2] was the principal published output of this\u000a      research programme. More recently,\u000a      Classics and the Uses of Reception [3], edited by\u000a      Martindale and R. Thomas (Harvard), may be\u000a      cited as an exemplary work with a typically strong Bristol contribution.\u000a    For more specific influence, three programmes of research are cited which\u000a      were presented at\u000a      public events. First is the Oxford History of Classical Reception in\u000a        English Literature, co-edited by\u000a      Martindale and D. Hopkins (Bristol, English) [4]. This five-volume\u000a      project is one of the largest ever\u000a      undertaken in the field. Volume 3 (1660-1790), the first to be published,\u000a      appeared in 2012. The\u000a      second example is the work of P. Michelakis (Bristol since 2002) on\u000a      antiquity in silent cinema [5].\u000a    Together with M. Wyke (Professor of Latin, UCL) Michelakis has been\u000a      recovering what has\u000a      become since the invention of talkies a vast forgotten territory. The\u000a      project has identified some 800\u000a      films in archives when previously only a handful were known. A rich\u000a      chapter in the history both of\u000a      classical reception and of modern culture is here being written for the\u000a      first time. Third, the AHRC-funded\u000a\u0009  project (&#163;461,000) of N. Morley (Bristol since 1995) on the\u000a      reception of Thucydides [6]. The\u000a      extent of Thucydides' influence stretches well beyond historiography to\u000a      embrace political\u000a      philosophy, international relations, war theory and military strategy. He\u000a      has been central to debates\u000a      about citizenship, the functioning of democratic constitutions, and the\u000a      causes of war, but one of the\u000a      paradoxes of his reception is how selective (and inaccurate) the knowledge\u000a      of his text often is. The\u000a      project has brought to light forgotten and surprising chapters in the\u000a      history of Thucydides'\u000a      influence.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41284","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Throughout her career at King's, in concert with her colleagues (see\u000a      REF3a), Herrin has taken every opportunity to promote public interest in\u000a      and understanding of the world of Byzantium and its legacy to the modern\u000a      world, through reviews, broadcasts, and lectures, seminars and conferences\u000a      open to the public. The aim of her research and its dissemination has\u000a      always been to challenge the traditionally negative public image of\u000a      Byzantium: impenetrable bureaucracy (`byzantine'), elaborate court and\u000a      religious rituals, intellectual and social rigidity, obscure religious and\u000a      political disputes, fiscal oppression, political and military\u000a      incompetence. Two recurrent themes have been to challenge traditional\u000a      views that the position of women in Byzantium was restricted, and that the\u000a      emergence of Byzantium marked the division of the Mediterranean world into\u000a      west and east. Public reaction to her 2001 Women in Purple,\u000a      reflected in its sales and translation into Czech, Greek, Polish and\u000a      Spanish, gave a foretaste of the extraordinary and ongoing reach of and\u000a      response to her 2007 Byzantium: The Surprising Life of a Medieval\u000a        Empire.\u000a    The spark to writing Byzantium was an encounter in King's with\u000a      two builders who, seeing her office nameplate, asked Herrin what\u000a      `Byzantine Studies' was. In response Herrin devised the novel format of\u000a      her book which, while maintaining intellectual rigour and a chronological\u000a      organisation, eschews the normal political and military narrative with\u000a      interspersed cultural sections in favour of a series of chapters on\u000a      significant events, places, people and topics, designed to make the\u000a      essence of Byzantium attractively accessible to a general reader. On\u000a      publication it soon became apparent that the book was reaching far beyond\u000a      the normal academic and academic-related audience. Reviews reflecting &#8212;\u000a      and in themselves increasing &#8212; its impact appeared in newspapers across\u000a      the world, from the Toronto Star on 23 March 2008 (`an armchair\u000a      delight'), through the Christian Science Monitor on 12 February\u000a      2008 (`the author embraces the reader in the love of her subject'), to the\u000a        Kolkata Telegraph on 1 February 2008 (`Herrin sets out to rescue\u000a      Byzantium from its negative stereotype . . she succeeds brilliantly')\u000a      (5.1). Herrin took up many media opportunities to discuss and promote the\u000a      book, in themselves indications of media perception of a growing public\u000a      interest. For example, she was interviewed by Alvaro Condamar on the\u000a      Spanish website of Random House Mondadori on 28 October 2009 (Mondadori\u000a      has 160,014 followers), and three times by national Greek newspapers: To\u000a        Vima on 2 November 2008 and 30 May 2010 (2010 circulation 116,000)\u000a      and Ta Nea on 17 December 2008 (5.2). Herrin was asked to write an\u000a      article for the Wall Street Journal of 11 March 2011 on how and\u000a      why popular interest in Byzantium is now growing. To coincide with the\u000a      Byzantium exhibition at the Royal Academy, Herrin was invited to write a\u000a      full 45-minute programme (recorded on location in Istanbul) for the\u000a      flagship Sunday Feature documentary on BBC Radio 3 on 19 October 2009\u000a      (average audience 75,000), which she focussed on Byzantium's crucial role\u000a      in the transition of Europe to modernity (5.2). Public reaction is\u000a      indicated by the existence of at least four pirated downloads of this\u000a      programme on the web.\u000a    The extraordinary reach of Herrin's Byzantium is attested by the\u000a      sales figures (only the hardback was available before 2008) to July 2013\u000a      which are exceptional for a book on ancient history, and a very pleasant\u000a      surprise to the original publishers (5.3): Penguin 8,108 hbk and 52,866\u000a      pbk (plus 954 e-book sales); Princeton UP 9,112 hbk and 7,337 pbk.\u000a      (Registered UK public lending figures to 2011\/12 total 3,646 borrowings.)\u000a      Total sales of translated editions at dates before and up to end July 2013\u000a      include: Greek over 7,325; Italian 3,968; Polish 7,991; Japanese 2,260;\u000a      Korean 2,156; Spanish 4,500. The number of translated editions &#8212; ten to\u000a      date (Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Spanish,\u000a      Swedish and Turkish) &#8212; show the perception by publishers of a worldwide\u000a      demand for this insight into Byzantium, attested also in messages from\u000a      them to Herrin (5.3). For comparison, best-selling anglophone books on\u000a      ancient history such as Scullard's From the Gracchi to Nero (1959)\u000a      and Finley's The Ancient Economy (1973) have only appeared in a\u000a      few foreign editions in the usual languages of classical scholarship\u000a      (Scullard: Italian 1983; Finley: French 1975, German 1986, and Italian\u000a      2008).\u000a    The book has excited many individual responses by readers expressing\u000a      their pleasure and surprise at discovering the `secret' history of\u000a      Byzantium, and how the book has made them want to know more and to visit\u000a      the surviving monuments. One of the more than 50 reader responses on\u000a      Amazon UK and US alone encapsulates the general tenor: `Judith Herrin is\u000a      apparently in love with Byzantium and she made me share her enthusiasm. A\u000a      wonderful book about an unknown and underestimated part of our past and\u000a      culture' (5.4). Herrin herself has received many letters and e-mails,\u000a      which reveal the varied backgrounds and interests of her readership,\u000a      ranging from a mining engineer in the sweltering Australian outback\u000a      spending his breaks with a colleague `talking about Byzantium and how much\u000a      they enjoyed your book', to a PhD student in Inorganic Chemistry at\u000a      Zurich, who wrote: `I have never been particularly interested in history,\u000a      but your book really woke up my curiosity and encouraged me to learn more\u000a      about the Byzantine Empire. Besides it motivated me to visit two beautiful\u000a      cities &#8212; Istanbul and Ravenna', and an American, who wrote: `I have long\u000a      had a large \"blank spot\" in my understanding of Western Civilization and\u000a      History . . I could never accept the contradictory description of\u000a      Byzantium as a thoroughly corrupt, morally bereft, and decayed\u000a      civilization that, nevertheless, lasted for more than 1,100 years! . . the\u000a      \"blank spot\" is now gone!' (5.5). Online discussion is exemplified by\u000a      presentation of the book on the campaigning digital commons website Open\u000a      Democracy as providing ideas for a possible post-national world where\u000a      communities cope peacefully with ethnic, religious and cultural\u000a      differences, what the writer bills as `the strong contemporary resonance\u000a      of Herrin's argument' (5.6).\u000a    In Greece Herrin was an invited speaker, because of her book, at the\u000a      Forum Makedonias, Thessalonike, 19-20 November 2010, in a theatre packed\u000a      with local entrepreneurs and media. This event was organised by the\u000a      Tourist Office of Northern Greece, with support from the Ministry of\u000a      Culture, to increase tourism to Thessalonike and the surrounding area.\u000a      Herrin spoke about the medieval monuments and their importance. As\u000a      reported in the local press, she explained, drawing on her book, how they\u000a      could help tourism by exploiting growing popular positive appreciation of\u000a      the particularly rich local Byzantine legacy (5.7).\u000a    The potential of Herrin's book to contribute to cultural rapprochement\u000a      between Greece and Turkey is illustrated by its translation into Turkish\u000a      with three print-runs and 1,488 sales (5.3), and reviews in three national\u000a      newspapers (Cumhuriyet, Gezgin, Zaman), with\u000a      comments such as (Zaman): `Herrin . . . gives her readers a\u000a      different perspective for looking at and understanding Istanbul with her\u000a      book' (5.1). As an invited keynote lecturer at the World History\u000a      Association at Sehir University, Istanbul, in November 2010, Herrin was\u000a      invited to meet the Foreign Minister of Turkey, to whom she later gave\u000a      copies of her book, and they discussed, and he supported, holding the next\u000a      International Congress of Byzantine Studies in Istanbul. To capitalise on\u000a      and carry forward this cultural dialogue, Papacostas and Rapti, colleagues\u000a      of Herrin in the Centre for Hellenic Studies, have organised for autumn\u000a      2013 at King's, with the support of the British Institute at Ankara and\u000a      the Turkish Embassy in London, a special series of five public lectures by\u000a      Turkish researchers on the theme `Bizans &#8212; new perspectives from Turkey in\u000a      Byzantine studies' (5.8).\u000a    The principal impact of Herrin's Byzantium book of 2007 has been\u000a      its creation of a greater worldwide knowledge and critical interest in the\u000a      history and culture of Byzantium &#8212; with some impact on tourism &#8212;\u000a      accompanied by a growing realisation at individual and community level\u000a      that it offers a model of ethnic, cultural and religious accommodation\u000a      bridging Europe and the Near East which helps us think through current\u000a      problems. The impact is sustainable for the foreseeable decade &#8212; the book\u000a      is being reprinted, new translations are in the pipeline, online debates\u000a      about the book's contents are continuing, and the lecture series of autumn\u000a      2013 is designed to stimulate further contacts and public events in Turkey\u000a      as well as in the UK. Surprised at the unforeseen public response, Herrin\u000a      now plans to trace more systematically the impact of her book on general\u000a      perceptions of Byzantium and the reflections on the modern world which it\u000a      is stimulating.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Public interest in Byzantium has traditionally been low, and Byzantium\u000a      mostly viewed as a decadent non-western postscript to Greco-Roman\u000a      civilisation.

The principal benefit is\u000a      cultural enrichment and increased knowledge of the international public\u000a      interested in the history of Europe and the Near East; the book has also\u000a      had impact in stimulating reflection on and discussion of current problems\u000a      of nationalism and intolerance, especially in the regions from the Danube\u000a      to the Tigris.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    King's College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"King's College London","InstitutionName":"King's College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003645}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"323786","Name":"Ankara"},{"GeoNamesId":"745044","Name":"Istanbul"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1: J.E.

While parallels can be found for\u000a      women transmitting imperial status and instituting religious foundations\u000a      as family memorials, only in Byzantium did two women, Irene and Theodora,\u000a      rule as emperors (rather than as queens). This book introduced comparative\u000a      research drawing on gender studies to Byzantine history, and first made\u000a      the functioning of the Byzantine court accessible and attractive to the\u000a      wide readership, public as well as academic, interested in political\u000a      history and gender studies in other periods.\u000a    Herrin's 2007 Byzantium: The Surprising Life of a Medieval Empire\u000a      (3.2) provides an introduction to Byzantine history which draws together\u000a      and expands Herrin's career-long research and publications. It explores\u000a      the whole civilisation, from the foundation of Constantinople in AD 330 to\u000a      its fall to the Ottomans in 1453, through 24 chapters arranged in\u000a      chronological order but in an unconventional format. Each chapter focuses\u000a      on an event, person, social practice, city or building or specific topic\u000a      crucial to the historical characterisation of Byzantium, for example the\u000a      reign of Basil II the Bulgar-slayer, the siege of 1453, Saints Cyril and\u000a      Methodios, Anna Komnene, veneration of icons, use of the fork, the Ravenna\u000a      mosaics, Mount Athos, literacy, eunuchs, the economy. Cumulatively these\u000a      build to impart a broader and deeper understanding of what Byzantium was,\u000a      and what it means today. Herrin stresses the strength and vitality of\u000a      Byzantine cultural self-identity created by combining ancient Greek\u000a      education and Roman law and administrative practices with Christian\u000a      beliefs and values, and also its generally unrecognised openness to new\u000a      ideas (e.g. hospitals for lepers) and technology (e.g. Greek fire). She\u000a      brings out the extensive influence Byzantium had on medieval and early\u000a      modern Europe, especially the Balkans and Russia, where Byzantine\u000a      missionary work converted huge populations to Christianity in its Greek\u000a      Orthodox form, and invented the Cyrillic alphabet. She also highlights\u000a      Byzantium's remarkable tolerance and accommodation of different\u000a      ethnicities and religions (e.g. provision of a mosque and synagogues in\u000a      Constantinople).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41285","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2215636","Name":"Libya"},{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Wootton, a former mosaicist himself, is passionate about the conservation\u000a      of ancient mosaics and\u000a      their presentation to the public. Since 2007 he has organised, and hosted\u000a      at King's College\u000a      London, the annual AGM and Symposium of the Association for the Study and\u000a      Preservation of\u000a      Roman Mosaics (ASPROM), of which in 2011 he was elected Chairman. During\u000a      the ASPROM\u000a      events and those run by him as part of the Applied Arts series (see\u000a      http:\/\/www.kcl.ac.uk\/artshums\/depts\/chs\/events\/specialevents\/AAW.aspx\u000a      and\u000a      http:\/\/www.kcl.ac.uk\/artshums\/depts\/chs\/events\/specialevents\/AAW2013.aspx),\u000a      he has showcased\u000a      recent work on mosaics in the UK and abroad, including advances in\u000a      documentation and\u000a      conservation, to a large and diverse audience. Wootton had already brought\u000a      his experience in the\u000a      study and conservation of mosaics to Libya in the excavations at\u000a      Euesperides (Benghazi) between\u000a      2003 and 2005 (see section 2 above). In his 1994-98 excavations at Lepcis\u000a      Magna, Walda had\u000a      instituted a training programme for Libyan as well as British students (www.alnpete.co.uk\/lepcis\/).\u000a      Walda has also for many years advised the Department of Antiquities in\u000a      Libya, of which he is an\u000a      accredited international representative, on how to support the care of\u000a      antiquities in Libya.\u000a    Because of their track record of research and local involvement, in\u000a      November 2010 the Getty\u000a      Foundation awarded Wootton and Walda a grant of &#163;64,000 for Conserving\u000a        and Managing\u000a        Mosaics in Libya, a project to organise a series of workshops in\u000a      Libya on the conservation of\u000a      mosaics and the management of archaeological sites (3.4-5). Gaddafi was\u000a      then in power and the\u000a      Department of Antiquities was struggling to manage their heritage sites\u000a      and train their employees.\u000a      The ancient mosaics, in particular, had been deteriorating badly due to\u000a      their exposure and the lack\u000a      of care. The project's aim was to ameliorate the situation through\u000a      workshops, using the research\u000a      experience of Wootton and Walda, and that of their international team, in\u000a      the documentation,\u000a      conservation and management of archaeological sites.\u000a    Implementation of the project was delayed by the uprising against Gaddafi\u000a      which began in\u000a      February 2011. Instead, in March 2011 Walda and Wootton, as known experts\u000a      on the sites, both\u000a      received e-mail requests from Blue Shield (www.ancbs.org)\u000a      and ICOMOS (International Council on\u000a      Monuments and Sites) to provide a list of sites of cultural importance in\u000a      Libya with their GIS co-ordinates\u000a      (5.1). This was wanted by NATO and the MOD (after the problems in Iraq) in\u000a      order to\u000a      minimise collateral damage to heritage sites by airstrikes during\u000a      Operation Unified Protector in\u000a      March to October 2011. Walda, aided by Wootton, was able to extract and\u000a      make user-friendly the\u000a      data from his research in support of Rouech&#233;'s epigraphic projects, which\u000a      Blue Shield then\u000a      supplied to NATO and the MOD. Walda was an invited member of the team sent\u000a      by Blue Shield on\u000a      two missions to Libya in early 2012 to report on war damage to\u000a      antiquities, and he contributed to\u000a      the subsequent reports detailing the archaeological impact of the uprising\u000a      and the NATO airstrikes\u000a      (5.2a-b). During and since the conflict he has been in frequent demand\u000a      from the worldwide media,\u000a      including NATO features, to comment on the state of the antiquities there\u000a      (5.4, 5.5). Contrary to\u000a      some hasty claims (e.g. 5.5c), NATO's `No strike list' was a great success\u000a      (5.3, 5.4, 5.5). The value\u000a      of the input by Walda and Wootton has been acknowledged by the President\u000a      of the International\u000a      Association of Blue Shield Committees in the second Blue Shield report\u000a      (5.2b) &#8212; `The mission\u000a      would not have been possible without the specialised knowledge and the\u000a      contacts of Dr. Hafed\u000a      Walda' &#8212; and again in his public lecture on the work of Blue Shield at\u000a      King's in June 2013 (5.2c).\u000a      The GIS data are now being used to form the basis for a comprehensive\u000a      record of sites and\u000a      monuments fundamental for managing Libya's archaeological heritage.\u000a    Between April 2012 and April 2013 Wootton and Walda were able to\u000a      implement their Getty-funded\u000a      project. They completed an evaluation trip and delivered two workshops\u000a      with John Stewart (English\u000a      Heritage) and Alaa El-Habasji (Monafia University). They gave general\u000a      presentations on mosaic\u000a      conservation and management to nearly 150 people, followed by tailored\u000a      workshops to some 50\u000a      staff, from senior and middle management to site controllers and\u000a      technicians, of the Libyan\u000a      Department of Antiquities. The feedback shows that the workshops gave the\u000a      Libyan staff the\u000a      confidence to assess the conservation problems of mosaics and implement\u000a      appropriate plans to\u000a      mitigating them (5.6, 5.8). Even those with no responsibility for mosaics\u000a      acknowledged the value of\u000a      the methodology as a framework for the management of the particular\u000a      heritage in their region, as\u000a      well as practical tips such as the use of lime mortar rather than cement.\u000a      Changes in practice are\u000a      already taking place. During the evaluation trip Wootton and Walda advised\u000a      on reburial of a mosaic\u000a      at Tocra, now completed by Ahmed Buzaian (5.7), and created a scheme for\u000a      the reburial of\u000a      mosaics in Sabratha at the request of the site controller, Mohamed\u000a      Abougela (3.5). They gave\u000a      talks about their project to community groups and the media, and were\u000a      invited to meet the\u000a      Municipal Council of Sabratha and the acting Governor to discuss practical\u000a      steps for heritage\u000a      conservation in the current situation. In its response to Wootton and\u000a      Walda's report, the Getty\u000a      Foundation praised `the excellent training that has been achieved on the\u000a      project, especially in the\u000a      light of the dramatic socio-political upheaval' (5.6). Back at King's in\u000a      February 2012 Wootton and\u000a      Walda held a public event, the `Libya Matters Workshop', jointly with the\u000a      Society for Libyan Studies\u000a      to promote the importance of Libya's heritage\u000a      (http:\/\/www.kcl.ac.uk\/artshums\/depts\/chs\/events\/specialevents\/Libya.aspx).\u000a      The international\u000a      community benefits greatly from this contribution to conserving Libya's\u000a      Roman (and pre-Roman)\u000a      heritage, but the local context is paramount. As the report on the second\u000a      Blue Shield mission\u000a      concluded: `Once again the importance of Cultural Heritage to restore\u000a      national identity and to\u000a      function as a binding factor for all tribes and factions became apparent.\u000a      The Libyan cultural\u000a      heritage and political authorities acknowledged this on more occasions'.\u000a      The challenge now is to\u000a      sustain support and progress in training Libyan heritage staff and\u000a      supporting conservation projects.\u000a      Wootton and Walda are developing a follow-up project, which will depend of\u000a      the availability of\u000a      finance (as well as political developments in Libya); on 12 March 2013 the\u000a      Chairman of the Libyan\u000a      Department of Antiquities wrote to Wootton to confirm the Department's\u000a      support (permits,\u000a      accommodation and maintenance, training facilities) for a forthcoming\u000a      major grant application to\u000a      continue the work (5.8).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This impact derives from Wootton and Walda's archaeological research into\u000a      the Roman sites of\u000a      Libya, including the GIS mapping of site locations, and study and\u000a      conservation of Hellenistic and\u000a      Roman mosaics. Against the difficult background of Gaddafi's regime, its\u000a      fall and the aftermath,\u000a      they have, by invitation, provided training and advice to the Libyan\u000a      Department of Antiquities in the\u000a      documentation, conservation and management of archaeological objects and\u000a      sites, especially\u000a      mosaics. They provided Blue Shield, on request, with a watch-list of sites\u000a      with GIS co-ordinates to\u000a      enable NATO to target their airstrikes to avoid them. The primary\u000a      beneficiaries are the Libyan\u000a      people, to whose national pride and identity this patrimony is crucial,\u000a      and the Libyan Department of\u000a      Antiquities. The secondary beneficiaries are the international community,\u000a      to whom Libya's rich\u000a      Roman-period cultural patrimony is of major concern.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    King's College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"King's College London","InstitutionName":"King's College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003645}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"88319","Name":"Benghazi"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1.

His research focuses on ancient crafts, especially the\u000a      techniques of production, and\u000a      he has developed innovative approaches to the study of ancient mosaics\u000a      (3.1), informed by his\u000a      own past as a professional mosaicist. In particular he has worked on new\u000a      documentation methods\u000a      of use to the archaeological and conservation communities to ensure the\u000a      proper recording of\u000a      primary materials and the application of appropriate methods for their\u000a      future preservation (3.2). His\u000a      research into documentation and presentation also has an important digital\u000a      component, and he has\u000a      just completed a two-year Leverhulme-funded project into an innovative\u000a      methodology, developed\u000a      with the collaboration of a working sculptor (Peter Rockwell), for the\u000a      identification and mapping of\u000a      Roman stoneworking techniques, which also explores the best methods for\u000a      the conservation and\u000a      recording of ancient sculpted monuments (3.2).\u000a    Wootton's work in Libya stems from his involvement in excavations at\u000a      Euesperides (Benghazi)\u000a      between 2003 and 2005. He trialled there his new methods for recording and\u000a      interpreting mosaics,\u000a      and advised on the first mosaic reburial to take place in Libya &#8212; see team\u000a      reports in Libyan Studies\u000a      34 (2003) 191-228, 35 (2004) 149-90, 36 (2005) 135-82. He has also\u000a      insisted on the critical value\u000a      of proper archaeological documentation beforehand, and this combination of\u000a      archaeological and\u000a      conservation research is at the heart of Conserving and Managing\u000a        Mosaics in Libya, a project\u000a      developed with Walda and funded by the Getty Foundation to assist the\u000a      Libyan Department of\u000a      Antiquities in heritage management (3.4, 3.5), whose impact is described\u000a      in section 4 below.\u000a    Walda has worked at King's as a researcher in Roman archaeology and\u000a      digital humanities since\u000a      the 1980s, moving with consecutive projects between the Department of\u000a      Classics, the Centre for\u000a      Hellenic Studies and the Department of Digital Humanities. He is currently\u000a      the Libyan Heritage\u000a      Management Research Fellow in the CHS. Walda ran his own excavations at\u000a      the major site of\u000a      Lepcis Magna in 1994-1998 (www.alnpete.co.uk\/lepcis\/).\u000a      He pioneered the use of GIS and other\u000a      mapping technologies for the presentation and interpretation of\u000a      archaeological materials online as\u000a      part of Rouech&#233;'s epigraphic projects, Inscriptions of Roman\u000a        Tripolitania and the ongoing\u000a      Inscriptions of Roman Cyrenaica (3.3a-b). He has also worked on the\u000a      integration of this information\u000a      with other web-based data such as Pleiades, the online gazetteer\u000a      of ancient places being\u000a      developed at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York\u000a      University, with the long-term\u000a      aim of establishing, systematically recording and making available\u000a      reliable co-ordinates for\u000a      Roman-period archaeological sites. His GIS expertise and research and\u000a      local knowledge led to his\u000a      invitation to join two Blue Shield missions to survey the condition of\u000a      heritage sites in Libya after the\u000a      revolution (see further section 4), and Walda contributed to the resulting\u000a      reports (5.2a-b).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41286","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    a) The main impact of Beaton's specified research to date has been on\u000d\u000a      Greek public discourse, to the benefit of the Greek public and all others\u000d\u000a      interested in modern Greek national identity.\u000d\u000a    Ever since the early 1800s a conspicuous strand in Greek public discourse\u000d\u000a      has been devoted to the question of defining modern Greek identity in\u000d\u000a      relation to the ancient past, and since the 1850s also the Byzantine past.\u000d\u000a      For a century and a half this discourse has been dominated by insistence\u000d\u000a      on the `continuity' of the Greek nation from antiquity to the present. The\u000d\u000a      research described here joins forces with recent work by academic\u000d\u000a      historians in Greece (e.g. Kitromilides, Liakos, Michaelides, Veremis) to\u000d\u000a      challenge that assumption, and itself derives in part from a heated\u000d\u000a      exchange in the Greek national press between public intellectuals Nasos\u000d\u000a      Vayenas and Antonis Liakos on this issue in 2005, as is more fully\u000d\u000a      explained in Beaton's 2007 paper (3.2). A new impetus was given to this\u000d\u000a      clash of ideologies in Greek public discourse with the financial and\u000d\u000a      social crisis that began in 2010.\u000d\u000a    It was at exactly this time (October-December 2010) that Beaton was in\u000d\u000a      Athens conducting documentary research for Byron's War, and was\u000d\u000a      able to take opportunities to present the results of his and his\u000d\u000a      colleagues' recent research directly to the Greek public. He was\u000d\u000a      immediately invited to give the interviews described below and to speak at\u000d\u000a      the Onassis Foundation, primarily because of his pre-existing public\u000d\u000a      reputation in Greece as an authoritative (and fluent Greek-speaking)\u000d\u000a      commentator on Greek culture and identity built up from widespread\u000d\u000a      interest in his 2003 book on the poet and leading intellectual George\u000d\u000a      Seferis (the Greek translation issued in 2003 sold 10,000 copies in 6\u000d\u000a      months, making it a best-seller) and because of his expertise attested by\u000d\u000a      numerous publications in Greek, on related issues, since the early 1990s.\u000d\u000a    On 14 November 2010 To Vima, the national newspaper of the\u000d\u000a      Centre-Left, published a 1,500-word interview of Beaton by Markos\u000d\u000a      Karasarinis; on 9 January 2011 I Kathimerini, the national\u000d\u000a      newspaper of the Centre-Right, published an 1,800-word interview by Ilias\u000d\u000a      Manglinis (5.1). The latter focussed on Beaton's profile as a researcher\u000d\u000a      into and commentator on modern Greek history and culture, the former on\u000d\u000a      issues such whether the revolutionary nature of the foundation of the\u000d\u000a      Greek nation has yet been generally appreciated, and whether on the\u000d\u000a      Romantic model intellectuals should be men of action. Beaton's invited\u000d\u000a      paper to the high-profile Athens Dialogues organised by the\u000d\u000a      Onassis Foundation at its Centre for Arts and Letters on 24-27 November\u000d\u000a      2010 (3.3, 5.2), on Byron, Shelley and the idea of Greece (previewing his\u000d\u000a      ongoing research), was warmly received by an audience of several hundred\u000d\u000a      and streamed worldwide to an audience claimed by the organisers at 40,000.\u000d\u000a      This led to more interviews in the Greek national media during the event\u000d\u000a      (details not kept), to Beaton's participation in a public discussion of\u000d\u000a      the current Greek crisis, again at the Onassis Centre, on 13 December\u000d\u000a      2012, attended by several hundred members of the public, including former\u000d\u000a      prime minister Kostas Simitis (5.2), and an hour-long in-depth interview\u000d\u000a      on the Apostrofos programme on national radio (ET3) broadcast on 4\u000d\u000a      April 2011. Interviews with Beaton on Byron and the foundation of the\u000d\u000a      Greek state were made for inclusion in the serialised TV documentary 1821\u000d\u000a      on the Greek Revolution of the 1820s, which was broadcast on the\u000d\u000a      independent channel Skai in 8 hour-long episodes during early 2011 (and\u000d\u000a      subsequently issued as a DVD), and in another high-profile TV documentary\u000d\u000a      (for The Time Machine programme) on the same topic, broadcast by\u000d\u000a      the national channel ET1 on 25 March 2012, the National Day of Greece, and\u000d\u000a      again on 25 March 2013.(Note: the national ET radio and TV service was\u000d\u000a      closed down by the government in June 2013, so corroborative data are now\u000d\u000a      irretrievable.)\u000d\u000a    These forms of public engagement in Greece secured wide dissemination for\u000d\u000a      the results of the King's conference and volume and of work-in-progress on\u000d\u000a      Beaton's Byron project, and brought Beaton and his work directly into\u000d\u000a      public discourse on the hotly controversial topic of modern Greek\u000d\u000a      identity, a rare achievement for a non-Greek (5.3). This impact is ongoing\u000d\u000a      and sustainable, and now merging with the impact of Beaton's book on Byron\u000d\u000a      (see end of b) below).\u000d\u000a    b) The more recent, and still developing, impact of Beaton's work on\u000d\u000a      Byron is on public knowledge and understanding of Byron, to the benefit,\u000d\u000a      through cultural enhancement, of the international general public\u000d\u000a      interested in Byron, the Romantic poets and Greek history.\u000d\u000a    Public dissemination of Beaton's discoveries about the political\u000d\u000a      significance of Byron's contribution to the Greek revolution began in\u000d\u000a      spring 2011, while research was still in progress, through invited\u000d\u000a      lectures to local Byron Societies at, for example, London, Edinburgh,\u000d\u000a      Dublin, and Missolonghi (Greece). These independent public-interest\u000d\u000a      societies co-operate through an international association, and aim to\u000d\u000a      provide events, information and contacts for Byron enthusiasts everywhere\u000d\u000a      (5.4). Beaton made available previously unknown documents about Byron's\u000d\u000a      role, which he had identified in archives in Athens, for public\u000d\u000a      dissemination on a non-academic website maintained on behalf of the\u000d\u000a      International Byron Society (5.5). As a result, King's was invited by the\u000d\u000a      President of The Byron Society (London), to bid to host the 39th\u000d\u000a      International Byron Conference in 2013, an annual forum for worldwide\u000d\u000a      public interest in Byron. The bid was accepted by the International Byron\u000d\u000a      Society, with a budget of &#163;10,000 provided by The Byron Society (London) &#8212;\u000d\u000a      a concrete expression of interest in and support for the research and\u000d\u000a      public profile of Beaton and his colleagues, and the conference took place\u000d\u000a      at King's on 1-6 July 2013. Beaton was chair of the Programme and\u000d\u000a      Organising Committees, and himself a plenary speaker. There were 124\u000d\u000a      registered participants (despite a registration fee of &#163;250) from 22\u000d\u000a      countries, mostly amateur enthusiasts, writers and journalists, and a few\u000d\u000a      academics. The theme, building on and extending Beaton's research on\u000d\u000a      Byron's activities in Greece, was Byron: the Poetry of Politics and\u000d\u000a        the Politics of Poetry. Feedback forms and individual messages to\u000d\u000a      Beaton attest to the public cultural enrichment derived from this event\u000d\u000a      (5.6): the many positive (anonymous) comments include `it certainly had an\u000d\u000a      impact on my approach to Byron's poetry and politics'. The President of\u000d\u000a      the Missolonghi Byron Society has invited Beaton to address her members\u000d\u000a      again in 2014 because, she writes, `From what we heard . . your work is\u000d\u000a      going to change the way we think about the British hero of our\u000d\u000a      Independence'; the President of the Byron Society (London), commenting on\u000d\u000a      the success of the conference, continued: `I think your new book Byron's\u000a        War has had, and indeed will continue to have, a significant impact\u000d\u000a      on the way both Byronists, historians and enthusiastic amateurs view\u000d\u000a      Byron's role in the Greek War of Independence and the origins of the\u000d\u000a      modern Greek state. As you know the Byron Society comprises predominantly\u000d\u000a      non-academics and this is very much the sort of area that society members\u000d\u000a      are interested in.'\u000d\u000a    In tandem with the conference, the exhibition Byron and Politics:\u000d\u000a        `Born for Opposition' opened on 24 June 2013 (continuing to 25\u000d\u000a      September) at the Maughan Library, King's College London, in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with the National Library of Scotland. This brings together for the first\u000d\u000a      time Byron manuscripts from the John Murray archive from the NLS, rare\u000d\u000a      printed items from the Foyle Special Collections at King's, and Byron\u000d\u000a      memorabilia in private hands, many of them never exhibited in public\u000d\u000a      before. Selection of exhibits and catalogue entries in the section\u000d\u000a      relating to Greece were determined largely by Beaton's research, and\u000d\u000a      Beaton advised the curators. An illustrated catalogue of the exhibition\u000d\u000a      was supplied free to visitors during the exhibition thanks to &#163;6,000\u000d\u000a      raised from private sources (mainly Byron enthusiasts), with an\u000d\u000a      institutional contribution by King's, to fund its production; it is now\u000d\u000a      freely available online. The private funding itself shows belief that\u000d\u000a      Beaton's research is having impact beyond academe, which is also attested\u000d\u000a      in the voluntary comments left by visitors to the exhibition (5.7).\u000d\u000a    Byron's War (3.4) was published in UK on 25 April 2013 and in the\u000d\u000a      USA in July. A contract for a Greek translation (by Patakis) was signed in\u000d\u000a      May 2013 (for an advance of &#8364;2,000, a clear indication of enthusiasm).\u000d\u000a      Laudatory reviews have appeared to July 2013 in non-academic media such as\u000d\u000a      The Spectator, Economist and Literary Review. Beaton\u000d\u000a      promoted dissemination beyond academia by contributing an article to History\u000a        Today 63\/6 (June 2013) 3-5. He has also received e-mails from\u000d\u000a      individuals attesting how his book has enriched their understanding of\u000d\u000a      Byron and the creation of the Greek nation-state (5.8). The impact of\u000d\u000a      publication of the book is only just beginning and will be sustainable for\u000d\u000a      several years. For example Beaton has accepted the proposal of the British\u000d\u000a      Embassy in Athens to hold a launch event at the embassy for the Greek\u000d\u000a      edition of his book (on 12 September 2013) and another from the Byron\u000d\u000a      Society of Missolonghi (for spring 2014). He has also accepted a proposal\u000d\u000a      from the Greek Embassy in London to organise a Byron-centred event,\u000d\u000a      including presentation of his book, at Edinburgh (in spring 2014) as one\u000d\u000a      of the cultural events to mark the Greek presidency of the EU (5.9).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Following on earlier research which re-examined the construction of\u000d\u000a      modern Greece, in 2008-12 Beaton researched the contribution of Byron (and\u000d\u000a      Romanticism) to the creation of the Greek nation-state in the early 19th\u000d\u000a      century, and has published the results in his 2013 book (3.4). The\u000d\u000a      principal impact of Beaton's researches has been to challenge traditional\u000d\u000a      Greek cultural and social assumptions about the continuity of their\u000d\u000a      national identity from the ancient world. The main pathway is his\u000d\u000a      distinctive contribution to the 200-year Greek debate about their national\u000d\u000a      identity which has been intensified by the current socio-economic crisis.\u000d\u000a      The principal beneficiaries are the Greek people, as reflected in public\u000d\u000a      discourse in their mass media, and the non-Greek public interested in\u000d\u000a      these issues. Other nascent beneficiaries are the worldwide community of\u000d\u000a      Byron enthusiasts through cultural enrichment in their knowledge and\u000d\u000a      understanding of Byron's role in creating modern Greece.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    King's College London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"King's College London","InstitutionName":"King's College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003645}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2964574","Name":"Dublin"},{"GeoNamesId":"264371","Name":"Athens"},{"GeoNamesId":"2643743","Name":"London"},{"GeoNamesId":"2964574","Name":"Dublin City"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a3.1.

In September 2006 they organised an\u000d\u000a      international interdisciplinary conference at King's on The Making of\u000d\u000a        Modern Greece (1797-1896), with 36 papers by historians, literary\u000d\u000a      specialists, political and social scientists, linguists, and historians of\u000d\u000a      religion. In 2009 Beaton and Ricks published a volume of essays\u000d\u000a      commissioned from selected contributors to the conference, themselves\u000d\u000a      included (3.1). The conference and volume, and other outputs (e.g. 3.2),\u000d\u000a      which reflected current scholarship on contemporary cases of\u000d\u000a      nation-building, proposed fresh insights into the historiographical,\u000d\u000a      literary and other sources for the 19th-century construction of Greek\u000d\u000a      national identity, and for the first time explored the cultural and\u000d\u000a      ideological processes at work within it. This research challenged the\u000d\u000a      long-held Greek self-definition of their national identity as the\u000d\u000a      `continuation' of ancient Greek civilisation and hence `exceptional' among\u000d\u000a      modern nations. Instead Beaton advocated treating Greece, the first new\u000d\u000a      nation-state to be established and internationally recognised in\u000d\u000a      19th-century Europe (in 1830), as a paradigm for comparative studies of\u000d\u000a      nationalism.\u000d\u000a    In 2008 Beaton developed a personal project to re-examine the iconic role\u000d\u000a      of Lord Byron in the Greek Revolution of the 1820s, using the extensive\u000d\u000a      Greek and other unpublished sources he had located. The aim was to situate\u000d\u000a      Byron's involvement with Greece in relation to his biography and Romantic\u000d\u000a      poetics on the one hand, and to the emergent politics of the Greek state\u000d\u000a      during the 1820s on the other. The project was supported by a Major\u000d\u000a      Leverhulme Fellowship from September 2009 to August 2012. Following some\u000d\u000a      previews of his ideas (e.g. 3.3), the resulting monograph, Byron's\u000d\u000a        War: Romantic Rebellion, Greek Revolution (3.4), demonstrates that\u000d\u000a      Byron was far more than a `romantic' victim at Missolonghi, but had\u000d\u000a      consciously transformed himself into a `new statesman'. In the political\u000d\u000a      confrontation between modernisers (supporters of a central government and\u000d\u000a      European-style constitution) and warlords (with a localist ideology based\u000d\u000a      on an ideal of self-sufficiency), Byron was a dedicated promoter of the\u000d\u000a      former option, and thus had a decisive &#8212; and previously unrecognised &#8212;\u000d\u000a      effect on the internal politics of revolutionary Greece, which\u000d\u000a      resulted in the precocious formation of a nation-state six years after his\u000d\u000a      death. Thus the debate about Greek political identity, which has since\u000d\u000a      re-surfaced many times in Greek history and is again live today, can be\u000d\u000a      traced directly back to the 1820s and the involvement of Byron and other\u000d\u000a      western philhellenes in the political formation of the Greek nation-state\u000d\u000a      (cf. 3.4).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41287","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Georgakopoulou's influence on language education in Greece has its roots\u000a      in her and Goutsos' Text and Communication (3.5), originally\u000a      published in 1999, whose impact continues to the present day. This was the\u000a      first handbook of discourse studies written in Greek, and achieved a wide\u000a      readership beyond academe &#8212; it was singled out by the national newspaper To\u000a        Vima as an `essential read for the friends of language and\u000a      linguistics' in its `Best books of the Year 1999-2000'. The book has gone\u000a      through nine impressions, and publishers competed to produce the\u000a      substantially revised second edition of 2011; it has sold around 25,000\u000a      copies, a striking number for the Greek market (5.1). The book created a\u000a      terminology accessible to, and applicable in practice by, teachers in\u000a      primary and secondary education. Since 1999 it has become increasingly\u000a      influential on educational theory, instruction and practice in Greece. It\u000a      is currently a prescribed textbook for undergraduate and postgraduate\u000a      programmes in Linguistics, Media and Communication Studies, and\u000a      Translation, at universities including Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras,\u000a      Aegean, and Ionian (5.2), and thus has been and continues to be studied by\u000a      the many philology and education graduates who become primary and\u000a      secondary schoolteachers. Since 2008 the book has been included on the\u000a      list issued by the Ministry of Education as `Guides for the Teacher' for\u000a      the teaching of Greek in schools (5.3), and it now serves, especially\u000a      through its `Tasks' section, as a resource for Greek teachers of language\u000a      skills in primary and secondary schools, particularly those with pupils\u000a      whose native language is not Greek (see feedback below).\u000a    Because of her high academic profile in discourse analysis, and her\u000a      proven ability through Text and Communication to make her own and\u000a      others' sociolinguistic research accessible and useful to teachers,\u000a      Georgakopoulou with Goutsos and Styliani were commissioned to write Greek\u000a        as a Foreign Language (3.6) by the Greek Ministry of Education as\u000a      part of the Programme for the Education of Muslim Minority Children in\u000a      Greece, funded by the EU with 17M euros for its first phase 1998- 2007,\u000a      and another 9M euros for the current second phase (5.4). The programme was\u000a      aimed at the production of material suitable for the needs of ethnic\u000a      minority children for whom Greek is their second or a foreign language, a\u000a      group which has grown considerably in the last fifteen years (almost 2,000\u000a      secondary schools in Thrace together have some 25,000 Muslim pupils), and\u000a      for the training of primary and secondary teachers working in schools with\u000a      a substantial percentage of ethnic minority children. Given the political\u000a      sensitivities in western Thrace, where Muslim students are a majority but\u000a      `minority' schools have no formal status, this material has had to be\u000a      directed at teachers through their post-qualification training. With the\u000a      economic crisis since 2010 and consequent growth in anti-immigrant\u000a      sentiment, practical support for educational integration of these children\u000a      has taken on an unexpected urgency. Georgakopoulou's own chapter in Greek\u000a        as a Foreign Language is inspired and informed by her small stories\u000a      research, and presents her results to be useful for teachers and to have\u000a      an impact in the classroom. She promotes pupil agency, particularly\u000a      important for minority children whose voices were often ignored in the\u000a      traditional teacher-centred classrooms. From 2004 on it has thus\u000a      contributed to enhancement of the teaching of many thousands of children\u000a      in Greek primary and secondary schools, especially those having to learn\u000a      Greek. Individual responses from professionals in teacher training and\u000a      teaching in Greece indicate that teachers' attention to the place of\u000a      small-story-telling in their lives helps these children build self-esteem\u000a      and improve their Greek-language acquisition.\u000a    `Departments of Education with a special interest in the needs of ethnic\u000a      minority children make extensive use of this book', writes one Professor\u000a      of Sociolinguistics (Patras); `In my MA courses where I teach the\u000a      narrative construction of identities, I constantly refer to her books and\u000a      articles, including the most recent ones, where Georgakopoulou introduces\u000a      the analytical model for small stories. . . [and, of his own work] In the\u000a      teaching proposals that we put forward, Georgakopoulou's work was more\u000a      than valuable. This can also be verified\/confirmed by school teachers who\u000a      exploit her work in the preparation of their educational material'.\u000a      Another Professor of Education (Athens) comments, `Let me explain the\u000a      problem a bit: there weren't and still are no official minority high\u000a      schools . . [so] there was also no official and non-conflictual way to\u000a      have alternative educational material . . . Alexandra's study [sc. 3.6]\u000a      has been very successful and influential, precisely because it stresses\u000a      the availability of or \"alternative\" materials and media. . . Even today\u000a      there is only a handful of studies concentrating on learners.' An\u000a      experienced high school teacher with ethnic minority pupils reports how\u000a      she implements strategies suggested in Georgakopoulou's works: `Teaching\u000a      them essay writing, quite often I ask them to write past stories with\u000a      memories from their homeland as well as future stories on how they would\u000a      like to be in Greece, i.e. their host country . . . I quite often ask my\u000a      students to exchange their stories via e-mail or facebook messages. Thus,\u000a      I discuss and analyse in class both my students' stories as well as their\u000a      responses to the stories they receive from their class-mates . . . the\u000a      writing of personal narratives motivates students and is particularly\u000a      suitable for promoting inter-cultural communication via enabling students\u000a      to express their cultural identities.' (5.5)\u000a    In the wider world too, Georgakopoulou's small stories research has begun\u000a      to have an impact in language teaching and learning, and also psychology.\u000a      Particularly in the field of TESOL (`Teaching English to speakers of other\u000a      languages'), attention to the sorts of communicative activities that are\u000a      the focus of small stories research is being promoted over the traditional\u000a      content analysis of autobiographical interviews as a means for learners\u000a      and teachers to reflect on their pedagogical experiences and identities,\u000a      and thus to help pupils become more confident and effective learners\u000a      (5.6). The insights of small stories research are also being drawn on in\u000a      life-stance counselling to help psychologists develop flexible `on the go'\u000a      models of therapy that can address the needs of specific populations which\u000a      for medical or social reasons cannot produce coherent `meaningful'\u000a      narrative accounts of their lives, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's\u000a      patients, the homeless, and young immigrants in youth centres (5.7).\u000a    Georgakopoulou's small stories research was intended to produce an\u000a      analytical apparatus for academic sociolinguistics. Its usefulness for &#8212;\u000a      and impact on &#8212; teaching practices (especially in second-language\u000a      contexts) was unforeseen. However, it has since been proactively developed\u000a      and promoted by Georgakopoulou through publications aimed at teachers, and\u000a      is ongoing and sustainable, with her direct involvement: the Greek\u000a      Ministry of Education has appointed her to the committee of the Hellenic\u000a      Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education which is currently (late\u000a      2013) evaluating the teaching and research practices of Education and\u000a      Philology Departments in HEIs in Greece. The potential of the small\u000a      stories approach for clinical psychology is now to be explored further by\u000a      Georgakopoulou and Ridsdale (Institute of Psychiatry, King's) as co-investigators\u000a\u0009  in an ERC-funded project for 2014-19, based in English\u000a      (King's), on `Egomedia. The Impact of New Media on Forms and Practices of\u000a      Self-Presentation'.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Georgakopoulou's research in discourse analysis has from around 2000\u000a    pioneered &#8212; and promoted the academic and pedagogical importance of &#8212; the\u000a    study of `small stories', that is everyday narrative conversations, using\u000a    data drawn primarily from schoolchildren in Greece, including their\u000a    communications through electronic media. Through her contributions to\u000a    handbooks officially designated for teacher training in Greece, her work has\u000a    become influential on teachers and hence classroom practices at secondary\u000a    level, especially in the fast growing and crucial field of teaching Greek as\u000a    a second language to migrant and minority children. The primary\u000a    beneficiaries are teachers and pupils in secondary schools in Greece, but in\u000a    other countries too Georgakopoulou's research has started to influence\u000a    educational theory and practice in teaching English as a foreign or second\u000a    language, and is also beginning to arouse interest for the psychotherapy of\u000a    groups unable to construct coherent narrative accounts of their lives.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    King's College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"King's College London","InstitutionName":"King's College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003645}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"255683","Name":"Patras"},{"GeoNamesId":"264371","Name":"Athens"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1.

Since its establishment in 2006, her work\u000a      has been supported by the Centre for Language, Discourse and Communication\u000a      at King's, of which she is Co-Director, with its commitment to practical\u000a      development of educational practice. From around 2000 Georgakopoulou has\u000a      directed her research to the collection and analysis of data in the\u000a      previously little studied area of the communication practices and\u000a      socio-cultural aspects of supposedly trivial story-telling (narrative\u000a      discourse) in everyday life. Her particular focus has been on\u000a      audio-recorded conversations of adolescent girls in Greece and, since\u000a      2004, their communications through digital media. Her researches have been\u000a      buttressed by PhD dissertations at King's which she has supervised, such\u000a      as those of Lytra (2003), published as Playframes and Social\u000a        Identities (2007), which studied children in a Greek school for\u000a      minorities, and of Spilioti (2007), who carried out the first study of\u000a      text-messaging among young people in Greece. The work of Georgakopoulou\u000a      and her students, and her collaborations with Goutsos (University of\u000a      Athens) (3.3) and, more recently, Bamberg (Psychology, Clark University)\u000a      (3.4), has pioneered a new paradigm for the study of identities through\u000a      narrative analysis, in effect creating a new field of `small stories\u000a      research' within the discipline of sociolinguistics.\u000a    Since the 1960s, narrative has been recognised across the social sciences\u000a      as the main qualitative method available for the study of identities. The\u000a      standard type of narrative used has been life stories told to a\u000a      researcher-interviewer. Small stories research has shown the limitations\u000a      of this approach by demonstrating the significance for identities analysis\u000a      of a whole range of other narrative activities in everyday life.\u000a      Georgakopoulou's revision of the criteria for what counts as narrative has\u000a      now been accepted by numerous studies. Her more recent focus on studying\u000a      the relationships between the sociolinguistics of everyday narratives and\u000a      the new forms of media used for communication (e.g. SMS, Facebook,\u000a      Twitter) is widely accepted as path-breaking, and is now being pursued by\u000a      other prominent researchers. Thus academic interest in certain types of\u000a      conversational story-telling, once disregarded as being of little\u000a      importance, has boomed, and is gaining a wider audience as communication\u000a      through digital social media has become a general interest and concern of\u000a      governments, educationalists and the media and public.\u000a    In step with the growing academic influence of her publications,\u000a      Georgakopoulou has been invited to teach small stories research in\u000a      numerous workshops as part of international conferences, summer doctoral\u000a      programmes, and invited professorships in Europe (including Denmark,\u000a      Finland, France, Germany) and the USA. Publications by her have been\u000a      translated into Spanish, Polish, Russian, Japanese, and now Russian. Her\u000a      work is frequently cited by leading scholars in the field, such as Herman,\u000a      Riessman and Labov, and standardly included in bibliographies for the\u000a      teaching of discourse and narrative analysis to undergraduate and\u000a      postgraduate students. She has been invited to write the first handbook\u000a      chapter on narrative and computer-mediated communication for the Pragmatics\u000a        Handbook of Computer-Mediated Communication (ed. S. Herring et al.,\u000a      2013). She is also co-editing, with Spilioti (her former PhD student, now\u000a      at Cardiff University), the Handbook on Language and Digital\u000a        Communication &#8212; the first of its kind &#8212; in the Routledge series\u000a      `Handbooks in Applied Linguistics'. Throughout her research career at\u000a      King's, Georgakopoulou has been and is committed to promoting knowledge\u000a      and debate of new developments in discourse analysis, including her own\u000a      research, among the academic and educational community in Greece through\u000a      the publication of handbooks in Greek in collaboration with Goutsos and\u000a      Sifianou, both University of Athens (3.5, 3.6).\u000a    "}]

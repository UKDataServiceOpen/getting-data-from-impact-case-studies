[{"CaseStudyId":"740","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Providing evidence to investigative journalist\/film-maker to support\u000d\u000a        key claims\u000d\u000a    Blakeley gave a detailed statement to libel lawyers for Lionsgate films\u000d\u000a      to corroborate claims made in John Pilger's film, `War on Democracy'\u000d\u000a      (2008). This was invaluable in convincing the lawyers of the veracity of\u000d\u000a      assertions that the US military had encouraged torture through its\u000d\u000a      training of Latin American military forces, 1945-2000. Blakeley's\u000d\u000a      statement, based on her research for State Terrorism and Neoliberalism,\u000d\u000a      [3.5], meant that key material on the US' role in torture could be\u000d\u000a      included in the film.\u000d\u000a    Influencing, informing and equipping the investigative and advocacy\u000d\u000a        work of human rights NGOs and lawyers\u000d\u000a    Detailed analysis of all available flight data on aircraft linked to\u000d\u000a      rendition has been made possible through the world's first comprehensive\u000d\u000a      open source database of rendition flights, an interactive map, and\u000d\u000a      accompanying analysis [3.1; 3.2]. The tool is accessed via The\u000d\u000a        Rendition Project website and The Guardian's website. Users\u000d\u000a      can now interrogate the flight data much more systematically, alongside\u000d\u000a      analysis and supporting evidence compiled by Blakeley's team, and victims\u000d\u000a      of rendition can be matched to specific flights to prove their renditions\u000d\u000a      took place.\u000d\u000a    The interactive flight tool was developed with the The Guardian's\u000d\u000a      Datablog team, following a demonstration by Blakeley's team (July 2012) of\u000d\u000a      the Rendition Flight Database [3.1] to The Guardian reporter, Ian\u000d\u000a      Cobain, and Simon Rogers (Datablog Director). Blakeley targeted The\u000d\u000a        Guardian because it has been one of very few international media\u000d\u000a      outlets that have systematically covered rendition. Compilation of the\u000d\u000a      underlying Rendition Flights Database was made possible after\u000d\u000a      Blakeley's team shared early research findings with the Human Rights NGO\u000d\u000a      Reprieve (in April 2011), including analytical content for The\u000d\u000a        Rendition Project website [3.2], and Blakeley's article `Dirty\u000d\u000a      Hands, Clean Conscience' [3.4]. This led to Reprieve and other NGOs\u000d\u000a      sharing flight data (from June 2011 onwards) obtained through various\u000d\u000a      Freedom of Information requests and investigations. NGOs have also made\u000d\u000a      extensive use of the rendition flights database and interactive map, and\u000d\u000a      have used the easily navigable and comprehensive repository of hundreds of\u000d\u000a      documents and explanatory commentary published by Blakeley's team on The\u000a        Rendition Project website. As Clare Algar, Executive Director of\u000d\u000a      Reprieve commented: `Reprieve has formed an excellent working partnership\u000d\u000a      with the Rendition Project.... [it] provid[es] far superior access to the\u000d\u000a      data than was previously possible. This has enabled us to link several\u000d\u000a      previously unidentified flight paths to prisoners and in turn to make data\u000d\u000a      on these flight paths available to legal teams in the US\u000d\u000a      and UK. We believe that our continued use of the Rendition Project map and\u000d\u000a      database will lead to further such examples in the future. The Rendition\u000d\u000a      Project website has swiftly become the most comprehensive online\u000d\u000a      repository of rendition-related information and we and our partner\u000d\u000a      organisations regularly use it in our research and analysis.' [5:2].\u000d\u000a    Changing understandings of journalists and the public on rendition and\u000d\u000a        torture practices\u000d\u000a    Blakeley's research has provided journalists with evidence to support\u000d\u000a      claims about the extent of UK involvement in rendition. Drawing on the\u000d\u000a      data from the Rendition Flights Database and interactive map [3.1,\u000d\u000a      3.2], The Guardian published four simultaneous articles on 23 May\u000d\u000a      2013. The first lead story [5:3] explained that The Rendition Project\u000d\u000a      proves many more renditions-related aircraft landed in UK territory than\u000d\u000a      previously thought. The reporter consulted Blakeley's team on using the\u000d\u000a      flight data to ensure his claims could be sustained. The second story\u000d\u000a      [5:3] focused on the research project and its findings. This story\u000d\u000a      described The Rendition Project as a 'groundbreaking research\u000d\u000a      project which sheds unprecedented light on one of the most controversial\u000d\u000a      secret operations of recent years'. Both stories appeared on line and in\u000d\u000a      print. Two further pieces [5:5] were published by The Guardian's\u000d\u000a      Datablog, one, an explanation of how the data was gathered, the other, a\u000d\u000a      user-guide for the interactive map. Cobain noted that The Rendition\u000d\u000a        Project `has given me, and others, a chance to see clearly the scope\u000d\u000a      and ambition of the rendition programme .... [and] has made a great\u000d\u000a      contribution to the efforts to put the puzzle together, in a way that will\u000d\u000a      be enormously helpful to the public for many years to come' [5:4].\u000d\u000a    Cobain's statement is supported further when looking at the website\u000d\u000a      traffic; the result of The Guardian's coverage increased national\u000d\u000a      and international media coverage of the project, and vastly increased\u000d\u000a      traffic to The Rendition Project website from around the world, as\u000d\u000a      indicated by Google Analytics data. In the month following the launch of\u000d\u000a      the database and interactive map, there were 20,527 unique visitors to the\u000d\u000a      website (this compares with figures in the low tens per month prior to\u000d\u000a      launch and coverage by The Guardian). Visits following launch and\u000d\u000a      The Guardian coverage were from users in 144 countries worldwide.\u000d\u000a      The bounce rate in that period (the percentage of single page visits, i.e.\u000d\u000a      people leaving the site from the entrance page without interacting with\u000d\u000a      the page) was 36%. This means that over 60% of visitors to the site\u000d\u000a      interacted with the page they entered the site on. In that period, website\u000d\u000a      visitors viewed an average of 3.95 individual pages. This shows that\u000d\u000a      visitors were exploring the site and reading content. There were\u000d\u000a      significant peaks when The Guardian published its story on 22 May,\u000d\u000a      with 3,972 unique visitors that day, and on 29 May, after widespread news\u000d\u000a      coverage of the extent of Scottish involvement, with 4,821 unique visits\u000d\u000a      that day.\u000d\u000a    Informing and equipping Scottish legislators, and triggering Scottish\u000d\u000a        police inquiry into use of Scottish airports for rendition\u000d\u000a    Following The Guardian's coverage of the Rendition Flights\u000d\u000a      Database and Interactive map [3.1, 3.2], Blakeley's team was approached by\u000d\u000a      Calum Ross from the Press and Journal newspaper to further\u000d\u000a      interrogate the database for flights in and out of Scotland.\u000d\u000a      Blakeley's team uncovered a dozen previously unknown flights through\u000d\u000a      Scotland that are likely to have been part of rendition operations, since\u000d\u000a      their onward flights were to locations where CIA prisons were known to be\u000d\u000a      operating when the flights took place. The circuits flown by the 12\u000d\u000a      aircraft in question were also consistent with previous known rendition\u000d\u000a      operations. These findings were covered widely in the Scottish national\u000d\u000a      press [5:8; 5:9], as well as by international media organisations\u000d\u000a      including the BBC [5:10] and RTV. The research findings on the use of\u000d\u000a      Scottish airports were then debated in the Scottish parliament, with SMPs\u000d\u000a      referring specifically to the research. As a result, in June 2013 the Lord\u000d\u000a      Advocate for Scotland instructed a Scottish police investigation, citing\u000d\u000a      The Rendition Project's findings. In July 2013, Blakeley's team was\u000d\u000a      approached by the senior investigating officer for the Scottish police\u000d\u000a      inquiry, to provide a dossier of evidence on the Scottish rendition\u000d\u000a      flights as part of the investigation. Collaboration with the investigation\u000d\u000a      is on-going.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Human rights lawyers, NGOs, journalists, the public and Scottish\u000d\u000a      legislators have been informed and equipped by research on rendition and\u000d\u000a      torture practices. The research has been used by human rights NGOs in\u000d\u000a      their investigation and advocacy work. The research has enabled\u000d\u000a      journalists to make claims that could not otherwise be supported about the\u000d\u000a      extent of rendition and torture, particularly the role played by the UK.\u000d\u000a      Wide international media coverage of the research led to a debate on the\u000d\u000a      use of Scottish airports for rendition in the Scottish parliament.

The framework for conflict resolution Miall developed jointly with University of\u000d\u000aBradford colleagues Ramsbotham and Woodhouse constitutes one of the most widely referenced\u000d\u000astudies in the field (4:B) and provides the full panoply of institutional and conflict-mitigating\u000d\u000aarrangements necessary for the effective resolution of contemporary disputes focusing in particular\u000d\u000aat different phases of the conflict cycle as well as novel methods of mapping conflictual situations.\u000d\u000aProfessor Edward Newman, formerly Director of Studies on Conflict and Security in the Peace and\u000d\u000aGovernance Programme of the United Nations University in Tokyo says it provides `a coherent and\u000d\u000acompelling overarching intellectual agenda' for the field.\u000d\u000a(C) Shaping Institutions for Democratic Participation in Deeply Divided Societies\u000d\u000aResearch conducted at Kent by Bieber (2006-10), Loizides (2011-) and Cochrane (2012-) has\u000d\u000afocused on the study of ethnic minorities and political accommodation in societies split across deep\u000d\u000aethnic, racial and religious divisions. Bieber (2006) examines how power-sharing arrangements\u000d\u000ahave reduced disparities in political representation in the Balkans while Cochrane (2013) examines\u000d\u000athe disconnect between elite-level institutions in Northern Ireland and popular expectations for\u000d\u000apeace. Cochrane (2013) and Loizides (2012) draw on the Northern Irish and Cypriot experience to\u000d\u000ainform mediations on civic engagement and political representation across divided societies.\u000d\u000aShared findings emphasize innovations in power-sharing inspired by the Northern Irish d'Hondt\u000d\u000amechanism applied in the formation of the cabinet; d'Hondt safeguards inclusivity in divided\u000d\u000asocieties as membership in the executive is automatically determined by electoral strength rather\u000d\u000athan post-election negotiations as commonly assumed. Loizides (2012) finds that such\u000d\u000amechanisms make power-sharing arrangements more negotiable and durable. He proposes a\u000d\u000afederal executive in Cyprus and elsewhere combining the Northern Irish consociational d'Hondt\u000d\u000astyle executive with an integrative co-presidency as an additional arbitration mechanism.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"1439","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    `The European Commission in Question' has had impact on three\u000d\u000a      institutions. First, the research\u000d\u000a      team was able - as outsiders - to ask questions that management could not\u000d\u000a      put to its own\u000d\u000a      employees and was granted unprecedented access within the organization. It\u000d\u000a      delivered detailed\u000d\u000a      analysis of the backgrounds, beliefs and attitudes of staff to managers\u000d\u000a      and others in the European\u000d\u000a      Commission. In the words of the Secretary General of the European\u000d\u000a      Commission, the findings of\u000d\u000a      the research `informed management thinking and fed into discussions\u000d\u000a        within the organization on\u000d\u000a        recruitment, career progression, reform and reform management. On\u000d\u000a        attitudes to reform, including\u000d\u000a        appraisal (the CDR), financial management and the new role of the\u000d\u000a        Secretariat General, the project\u000d\u000a        produced data that contributed to [our] understanding of staff views and\u000d\u000a        feedback on the processes\u000d\u000a        concerned.' Further, the `breakdowns by department, nationality,\u000d\u000a        gender and level of seniority . . .\u000d\u000a        provide[d] valuable new information to senior officeholders . . .\u000d\u000a        enabled managers in the\u000d\u000a        Commission to develop a more fine grain understanding of the views of\u000d\u000a        staff.' (see below, 5.5) For\u000d\u000a      similar reasons, President Barroso commented in January 2010, following\u000d\u000a      presentations to senior\u000d\u000a      officeholders, that the project: `will help us make the Commission a\u000d\u000a        more efficient and effective\u000d\u000a        administration that better serves European citizens' (5.4 below).\u000d\u000a      Lunchtime presentations were\u000d\u000a      videoed for training purposes.\u000d\u000a    The results of the research were communicated by several means.

Following completion\u000d\u000a      of the analyses,\u000d\u000a      Kassim made invited presentations to senior officeholders at the Directors\u000d\u000a      General weekly\u000d\u000a      meeting, 1 July 2010 (50 top managers, chaired by the Secretary General),\u000d\u000a      the Commission's\u000d\u000a      Lunchtime Seminar on 12 July 2011, attended by 40 officials, the European\u000d\u000a      Commission Careers\u000d\u000a      Network, 13 July 2011 (15 officials), senior management teams in DGs\u000d\u000a      MARKT, Secretariat\u000d\u000a      General European Personnel and Selection Office, COMP, JUST, TAXUD, EMPL,\u000d\u000a      INFSO (12 July\u000d\u000a      to 12 October 2011), as well as to Vice President &#352;ef&#269;ovi&#269;'s private\u000d\u000a      office (24 July 2012). Kassim\u000d\u000a      also addressed the Commission's Senior Management Seminar, 13 September\u000d\u000a      2012, attended by\u000d\u000a      the Commission's top 400 managers and addressed by President Barroso, Vice\u000d\u000a      President\u000d\u000a      &#352;ef&#269;ovi&#269;, and Secretary-General of the Council. According to the\u000d\u000a      Commission Secretary General:\u000d\u000a      `Slide presentations of provisional findings at regular intervals\u000d\u000a        throughout the project and an early\u000d\u000a        copy of the manuscript . . . provide[d] important insights into the\u000d\u000a        backgrounds of staff, their\u000d\u000a        motivation for joining the Commission and career mobility'.\u000d\u000a    Impact was not limited to officeholders at the very top (see 5.8 below).\u000d\u000a      The Secretary General\u000d\u000a      writes that findings concerning `the characteristics and challenges of\u000d\u000a        each department in terms of\u000d\u000a        staff, motivation, perceptions and mobility\/career patterns, as well as\u000d\u000a        the origins, composition and\u000d\u000a        outlook of the personnel in each department... These findings have been\u000d\u000a        of particular use to\u000d\u000a        managers across the organization, especially since senior managers are\u000d\u000a        subject to rotation. They\u000d\u000a        have found it helpful to have an analysis of the workforce in the\u000d\u000a        departments for which they have\u000d\u000a        taken recent charge.' They also observed that: `the project has\u000d\u000a        been useful in challenging widely\u000d\u000a        accepted myths about the Commission and its staff'.\u000d\u000a    Second, analysis of the nationality and career profiles of Commission\u000d\u000a      officials contributed to FCO\u000d\u000a      reflections on how the UK can improve the recruitment of British nationals\u000d\u000a      to the European\u000d\u000a      administration at a time that the UK is severely underrepresented. Kassim\u000d\u000a      delivered a presentation\u000d\u000a      at the FCO to an audience of 40 civil servants from across Whitehall. The\u000d\u000a      FCO official from the\u000d\u000a      European Directorate who organized the visit, wrote afterwards (5.4,\u000d\u000a      below): `The event was\u000d\u000a        deemed to be a great success . . . Your findings have since been\u000d\u000a        circulated widely throughout\u000d\u000a        government.

Connolly and Kassim subsequently participated in a\u000d\u000a      `brainstorming' meeting with senior\u000d\u000a      FCO officials on the future of recruitment policy.\u000d\u000a    Third, at a critical juncture in Scotland's politics, when the Scottish\u000d\u000a      government increasingly needs\u000d\u000a      to engage with the European Commission, presentations on 4 November 2012,\u000d\u000a      made by Peterson\u000d\u000a      and Kassim in the External Affairs Division of the Scottish government,\u000d\u000a      attended by officials from 7\u000d\u000a      divisions, delivered findings designed to assist officials in better\u000d\u000a      engaging with the Commission.

The Commission employs\u000d\u000a        more\u000d\u000a        economists and more scientists than lawyers, while at least a third of\u000d\u000a        officials have worked\u000d\u000a        in business.\u000d\u000a      Although attracted to Brussels by a `commitment to Europe', officials\u000d\u000a        are not `federalists'.\u000d\u000a        Only a minority want the Commission to become the government of Europe,\u000d\u000a        and although\u000d\u000a        officials would like `more Europe' in some policy areas, they think that\u000d\u000a        there should be `less\u000d\u000a        Europe' in agriculture. In other words, officials are not instinctively\u000d\u000a        expansionist.\u000d\u000a      Political affiliation and experience in a Commissioner's private\u000d\u000a        office (`cabinet') do not affect\u000d\u000a        career progression. Gender does play a role - the small number of women\u000d\u000a        in managerial\u000d\u000a        posts reached their positions more rapidly than their male counterparts\u000d\u000a        - but, recruitment\u000d\u000a        associated with enlargement apart, there is no evidence that nationality\u000d\u000a        affects speed of\u000d\u000a        promotion.\u000d\u000a      The Commission is not an antiquated bureaucracy, resistant to reform.\u000d\u000a        The reforms\u000d\u000a        undertaken under the Prodi Commission (1999-2004) brought the Commission\u000d\u000a        more\u000d\u000a        closely into line with other administrations in financial management and\u000d\u000a        personnel policy.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Three further findings point to future challenges for the organization:\u000d\u000a      the underrepresentation of\u000d\u000a      larger member states (France, Germany, Poland and the UK) threatens the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness and the\u000d\u000a      legitimacy of the organization; differing values between officials from\u000d\u000a      old and new member states\u000d\u000a      may create intra-departmental tensions on policy and may threaten settled\u000d\u000a      policy nostrums; and\u000d\u000a      the underrepresentation of women in management positions remains a\u000d\u000a      problem.\u000d\u000a    Pathways to impact included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Meetings with top managers in the Commission throughout the project,\u000d\u000a        regular\u000d\u000a        presentations to the Secretary General, representatives of the\u000d\u000a        Commission President, and\u000d\u000a        senior officials responsible for personnel policy, delivery of early\u000d\u000a        draft chapters, conference\u000d\u000a        papers and policy briefings, as well as an advance copy of the entire\u000d\u000a        book manuscript to\u000d\u000a        the Secretary General;\u000d\u000a      Invited presentations to top managers, to senior managers in\u000d\u000a        individual departments, to\u000d\u000a        staff groups concerned with career development, and to general meetings\u000d\u000a        open to all the\u000d\u000a        Commission's staff, with the aim of informing officials about the\u000d\u000a        backgrounds, careers,\u000d\u000a        beliefs and attitudes of officials to reform, enlargement and the\u000d\u000a        Commission's internal\u000d\u000a        operation (see factual statement from the European Commission Secretary\u000d\u000a        General);\u000d\u000a      Communications with the FCO and the Scottish government, leading to\u000d\u000a        invited\u000d\u000a        presentations and follow-up consultation (see respectively email from\u000d\u000a        the FCO and Scottish\u000d\u000a        government questionnaire returns);\u000d\u000a      Targeted circulation of findings through dissemination events attended\u000d\u000a        by UK decision\u000d\u000a        makers, diplomats and NGOs, and policy briefings that highlight findings\u000d\u000a        on key themes;\u000d\u000a        and\u000d\u000a      Presentation of findings in a form accessible to non-specialists on a\u000d\u000a        dedicated project\u000d\u000a        website available to the public, as well as articles in specialist press\u000d\u000a        and on blogs (see\u000d\u000a        section 5).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1440","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Overall, the research has had a significant impact on the conduct of\u000d\u000a      policy at `the boundary', affecting the conduct and organisation of a key\u000d\u000a      government committee, changing its relationship to the larger\u000d\u000a      environmental and sustainability policy community. It has thus had - and\u000d\u000a      continues to have - an impact on the environmental policy-making process\u000d\u000a      itself.\u000d\u000a    The impact process\u000d\u000a    Following the closure of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution\u000d\u000a      (RCEP) and the end of funding for the Sustainable Development Commission\u000d\u000a      (SDC) in 2010, the EAC addressed the need to embed sustainable development\u000d\u000a      across government policy-making through two sequential inquiries.\u000d\u000a    Based on the above research, a detailed `summary for stakeholders'\u000d\u000a      briefing was prepared, as was a written submission to the EAC's first\u000d\u000a      inquiry. Consequently Turnpenny and Russel were called to give oral\u000d\u000a      evidence to the EAC on 17th November 2010.\u000d\u000a    The evidence presented the challenges of integrating sustainable\u000d\u000a      development into the machinery of government, and outlined recommendations\u000d\u000a      for how the EAC might operate in the future. Among the research team's\u000d\u000a      recommendations were that the EAC should:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      focus on fewer issues, while minimising overlap with other Select\u000d\u000a        Committees, to enable greater depth of analysis\u000d\u000a      revitalise its cross-cutting role, enabling it to challenge\u000d\u000a        established `world views' of departmental Select Committees\u000d\u000a      maintain the credibility, legitimacy and salience of the evidence it\u000d\u000a        presents by drawing on the latest evidence, rather than just on familiar\u000d\u000a        actors\u000d\u000a      develop its `entrepreneur' and `persuasive advocate' roles, filling\u000d\u000a        the vacancy caused by the abolition of the RCEP; it should be a\u000d\u000a        legitimate and credible advocate of sustainable development across\u000d\u000a        Whitehall, not `captured' by any department's agenda or accepted norms\u000d\u000a        of operation.\u000d\u000a      be significantly better-resourced, particularly the Secretariat and\u000d\u000a        specialists, with, for instance, support for more in-depth analysis for\u000d\u000a        each inquiry. This would imply a more `staff-driven' committee, so it\u000d\u000a        would be important to maintain support of members to ensure EAC's\u000d\u000a        legitimacy and accountability.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    This evidence formed an important part of the EAC's inquiry report (EAC\u000d\u000a      2011a), and the basis for two of its thirteen headline recommendations to\u000d\u000a      government (paras 73 and 78). The subsections on `Parliamentary Scrutiny'\u000d\u000a      (paras 63-69) and `Wider Stakeholder Scrutiny' (paras 70-73) directly\u000d\u000a      referred to Turnpenny et al's recommendations for greater engagement with\u000d\u000a      a wide range of expertise at an early stage in the policy process to\u000d\u000a      `assist [government] in developing more innovative ways of addressing\u000d\u000a      sustainability issues' (para 73\/Recommendation 12). The fourth section of\u000d\u000a      the report on `A New Sustainable Development Strategy' was framed around\u000d\u000a      Turnpenny et. al.'s arguments for a coherent strategy to `revitalise\u000d\u000a      Government on this essential foundation for all policy-making' (para\u000d\u000a      78\/Recommendation 13), including embedding sustainable development in the\u000d\u000a      Treasury manual for policy appraisal, and potential use of sanctions for\u000d\u000a      under-performing departments.\u000d\u000a    In its official response (HMG 2011), the Government agreed with\u000d\u000a      Recommendation 12, but offered no clear mechanism for embedding the\u000d\u000a      perspectives of such expertise in policy-making. The Government disagreed\u000d\u000a      with Recommendation 13, arguing that overarching commitment to high- level\u000d\u000a      principles of sustainable development and transparency allow `both public\u000d\u000a      and parliament to scrutinise our progress' (HMG 2011, Response to Rec 13).\u000d\u000a    In reply, the EAC acted directly on Turnpenny et al.'s research findings\u000d\u000a      by:\u000d\u000a    1) Committing to improve links with academic institutions and the\u000d\u000a      appointment of two specialist advisers (EAC 2011b, para 21).\u000d\u000a    2) Forming a sustainability knowledge network. This feeds diverse\u000d\u000a      academic research directly into EAC inquiries, and advises on appropriate\u000d\u000a      topics for inquiry. This network meets annually with the EAC under the\u000d\u000a      auspices of the British Academy.\u000d\u000a    3) Pursuing a more `seminar style' format in which different experts\u000d\u000a      debate ideas, alongside its more traditional adversarial inquiry format -\u000d\u000a      based on Turnpenny et al.'s recommendations to enable more in-depth\u000d\u000a      discussion of ideas.\u000d\u000a    4) Considering a sequential approach to wide ranging topics with long\u000d\u000a      time horizons (such as the measurement and auditing of wellbeing).\u000d\u000a    5) Reaffirming its `scrutiniser' role, committing itself to monitoring\u000d\u000a      `changes in ... legislation and regulations and examine these where they\u000d\u000a      might dilute sustainability' (EAC, 2011b, para 13) and to monitoring the\u000d\u000a      `development of ... impact assessment tools' (para 14) - i.e. appraising\u000d\u000a      both policy and the instruments of policy appraisal.\u000d\u000a    6) Confirming the importance of international leadership on\u000d\u000a      sustainability, and set out its role in this.\u000d\u000a    The Special Advisor to the EAC confirmed: \"the recommendations of the\u000d\u000a        Turnpenny team have proved influential for the new ways of working of\u000d\u000a        the Committee, which is continually exploring innovative approaches to\u000d\u000a        its ways of working\" (email E1).\u000d\u000a    The research has also helped the environmental policy and research\u000d\u000a      community by broadening the sources and depth of the evidence base upon\u000d\u000a      which the EAC draws. For example, the Head of International Cooperation at\u000d\u000a      the European Environmental Agency (email E4) reported that the research\u000d\u000a      addressed issues of concern to the EEA, particularly in relation to the\u000d\u000a      `science-policy interface'; Policy Analysts at the House of Commons\u000d\u000a      library (email E5) circulated it to other committees because they `may be\u000d\u000a      able to learn some lessons from it'; and the Sustainable Development\u000d\u000a      Scrutiny Officer at the Scottish Parliament (email E3) asked for\u000d\u000a      recommendations for Scotland based on the research.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted by John Turnpenny shaped the recommendations of the\u000d\u000a      House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee (EAC).

The research built\u000d\u000a      on Turnpenny's long-standing interest in how 'boundaries' are drawn\u000d\u000a      between evidence and politics, experts and advocates, and about who draws\u000d\u000a      them, how and why. These are key questions within policy and political\u000d\u000a      science, geography and science studies. The research sought to explain how\u000d\u000a      this process of demarcation affects the legitimacy granted to policy\u000d\u000a      actors, enabling or disabling `ownership' of key issues. The central aim\u000d\u000a      was to test and clarify understanding of these boundaries through a close\u000d\u000a      empirical case-study of the EAC. It involved detailed content analysis of\u000d\u000a      21 EAC reports and 19 interviews with key actors. These formed the basis\u000d\u000a      for a study of how the EAC drew boundaries and, more broadly, of the\u000d\u000a      context, consultation processes, roles and influence of the EAC.\u000d\u000a    Findings\u000d\u000a    The research demonstrated that the EAC straddled boundaries between:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      evidence and policy-making generally, confronting government with\u000d\u000a        diverse sources of information\u000d\u000a      different experts with diverse interpretations of data (thus becoming\u000d\u000a        a site of conflict between scientists)\u000d\u000a      environmental interests, other interests and government\u000d\u000a      what is seen as a `realistic' and what `not a sensible' perspective;\u000d\u000a        this affects who is called to give evidence by the EAC, and filters the\u000d\u000a        presentation of evidence\u000d\u000a      institutions: between central government and parliament, for example\u000d\u000a      Whitehall departments themselves, enhanced by the cross-cutting nature\u000d\u000a        of the EAC\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    More broadly the research showed that the EAC takes four roles:\u000d\u000a    a) As knowledge-broker: acting as an intermediary between\u000d\u000a      original researchers and policy- makers; an umpire between different\u000d\u000a      arguments, legitimating contributors' positions by considering them\u000d\u000a      `worthy' of inclusion in a report (which in turn amplifies certain ideas\u000d\u000a      in wider policy circles).\u000d\u000a    b) As entrepreneur: the EAC sits at the intersection of\u000d\u000a      `problems', `policy ideas' and `politics', enabling it to raise the\u000d\u000a      profile of particular problems, analyse and give credibility to potential\u000d\u000a      policy solutions, and shift the political climate in ways that increase\u000d\u000a      the likelihood of government action.\u000d\u000a    c) As persuasive advocate: the EAC disseminates ideas\u000d\u000a      (e.g. the results of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment) and helps -\u000d\u000a      through its role as a credible voice - to ensure their wider acceptance.\u000d\u000a      There is a clear synergy (and potential clashes) with the knowledge-broker\u000d\u000a      role.\u000d\u000a    d) As scrutiniser: the EAC holds government to account. Although\u000d\u000a      its remit is limited the EAC can `shame' government or be a `critical\u000d\u000a      friend' highlighting inconsistencies in policy.\u000d\u000a    Researchers\u000d\u000a    The EAC research was carried out between 2008 and 2010. The researchers\u000d\u000a      were John Turnpenny (Senior Lecturer, School of Political, Social\u000d\u000a      and International Studies, University of East Anglia), Duncan Russel\u000d\u000a      (Senior Lecturer, Department of Politics, University of Exeter), and Tim\u000d\u000a      Rayner (Senior Research Associate, University of East Anglia). The elite\u000d\u000a      interviews were carried out between July 1st 2009 and 30th\u000d\u000a      September 2010 with the support of the Nuffield Foundation Social Science\u000d\u000a      Small Grants Scheme. The Principal Investigator for the grant was John\u000d\u000a      Turnpenny.

However it is clear that the public and policy debates have\u000d\u000a      been stimulated by the research undertaken and subsequent analyses of\u000d\u000a      Aughey, Birrell and Trench. A major institutional context for these\u000d\u000a      debates about Englishness, and by extension Britishness, is the Parliament\u000d\u000a      at Westminster. In a House of Lords debate in 2009, Lord Bew\u000d\u000a      referred to Aughey's research as a major political science intervention in\u000d\u000a      the debate which the government needed to note: `Now, when new Labour\u000d\u000a        wants to define positive Britishness and turns to its natural historical\u000d\u000a        intelligentsia, it does not receive much help. In fact, the most\u000d\u000a        relevant academic interventions may now come from the community of\u000d\u000a        political science&#8212;the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, being a striking example\u000d\u000a        in his fine speech earlier today, the work of the Constitution Unit,\u000d\u000a        Professor Arthur Aughey's important work in Belfast, and even old hands\u000d\u000a        such as Professor Sir Bernard Crick' (see source 1). As a\u000d\u000a      consequence of this citation, in December 2009 Aughey was invited to\u000d\u000a      participate in a roundtable discussion at Number 10 Downing Street\u000d\u000a      on the question of a written constitution for the UK, one proposal to\u000d\u000a      resolve the outstanding problems specifically related to the asymmetry of\u000d\u000a      devolution. Convened by a member of the Number 10 Private Office's Policy\u000d\u000a      Unit Aughey's specific contribution was on the implications of\u000d\u000a      constitutional change for England and its distinctive place within the\u000d\u000a      post-devolution constitution. Subsequently, contact was maintained with\u000d\u000a      the convenor of that event after the 2010 General Election and the change\u000d\u000a      of government, now as Director of the Institute for Public Policy\u000d\u000a        Research (IPPR). IPPR took up the English Question as one of its\u000d\u000a      projects and Aughey's input into that project was both direct (being\u000d\u000a      consulted by the director of the project) and indirect, through\u000d\u000a      participation in a number of seminars run at the IPPR's offices in London\u000d\u000a      between 2010- 2013. The Director of IPPR said that: `Aughey\u000d\u000a        ...pinpoints the factors that have led to an emergent English anxiety,\u000d\u000a        as well as those that weigh against the expression of that anxiety in a\u000d\u000a        new English nationalism' (see source 2). A subsequent IPPR policy\u000d\u000a      paper by Professor Richard English referred specifically to the excellence\u000d\u000a      of Aughey's monograph on England in terms of the comprehensive nature of\u000d\u000a      the research as a vital reference point for framing future discussions\u000d\u000a      about English nationalism (see source 3). The key impact has been the\u000d\u000a      realisation that English nationalism is (at the moment) `a mood not a\u000d\u000a      movement' and both sources indicate clearly how Aughey's work has enhanced\u000d\u000a      cultural understandings of the English identity among those tasked with\u000d\u000a      the formulation of new policy directions for England. This `mood not a\u000d\u000a      movement' finding was explicit in his written submission to the McKay\u000d\u000a        Commission on the Consequences of Devolution for the House of Commons\u000d\u000a        (2012). Subsequently Aughey was invited to give further oral\u000d\u000a      evidence when the Commission held its hearings in Belfast (June 2012) and\u000d\u000a      led to specific reference to his contribution to the Commission's findings\u000d\u000a      (see source 4).\u000d\u000a    Birrell's work on the comparative functioning of the devolved\u000d\u000a      institutions and their relationship to the Westminster Parliament led to\u000d\u000a      the invitation by the David Hume Institute in February 2013 to\u000d\u000a      contribute to their ESRC funded `conversation' on issues relating to\u000d\u000a      constitutional change in Scotland particularly as they related to social\u000d\u000a      security and welfare in Northern Ireland. Jeremy Peat, the Director of the\u000d\u000a      David Hume Institute referred to this paper amongst others as `an\u000d\u000a        important, evidenced based and transparent contribution within the\u000d\u000a        critical debate in Scotland on possible constitutional change' (see\u000d\u000a      source 5). In Northern Ireland, Birrell was invited to give evidence to\u000d\u000a      the Assembly and Executive Review Committee in Northern Ireland as\u000d\u000a      part of their `Review of D'Hondt, Community Designation and Provisions for\u000d\u000a      Opposition'. His contribution focused on the question of reducing the\u000d\u000a      number of departments and the operation of the Northern Ireland Executive.\u000d\u000a      His evidence suggested that departmental reduction was a complex issue and\u000d\u000a      drew on comparative material to explain executive functions (see source\u000d\u000a      6). The evidence was referred to in the final published report and an\u000d\u000a      article based on his evidence was published in the Belfast Telegraph\u000d\u000a      (9 May 2013) indicated that his work had public resonance, helping to\u000d\u000a      shape the debate. The final report, as Birrell advised, did not recommend\u000d\u000a      a reduction in departments. Birrell's research has highlighted issues and\u000d\u000a      difficulties in policy making processes in the Northern Ireland Executive\u000d\u000a      and Assembly due to both the mandatory power-sharing coalition and\u000d\u000a      weaknesses in the policy capacity of government departments. His work on\u000d\u000a      the policy process, the devolved policy style, policy copying and forms of\u000d\u000a      delegated governance has been presented in seminars and discussions with\u000d\u000a      senior civil servants, MLAs and NGOs through the Knowledge Exchange\u000d\u000a        Seminar Series (KESS) which seeks to promote `evidence-led policy\u000d\u000a      and law-making within Northern Ireland'. It is sponsored collaboratively\u000d\u000a      by Queen's University of Belfast, University of Ulster and the Assembly's\u000d\u000a      Research and Information Service (RaISe) (see source 7). His participation\u000d\u000a      in an IPPR Project on devolution in practice - on issues of policy\u000d\u000a      divergence between the devolved administrations and England - and his\u000d\u000a      paper comparing devolution and asymmetric devolution in the yearbook\u000d\u000a      series \"Contemporary Wales\" informed discussion on the future of Welsh\u000d\u000a      devolution in context of the Silk Commission's deliberations.\u000d\u000a    Indeed, informing and advising government has been a constant theme of\u000d\u000a      the research team on devolution and Trench's impact has come largely from\u000d\u000a      advisory roles based on his research findings. Prior to his appointment at\u000d\u000a      the University of Ulster, he has acted as a specialist adviser on\u000d\u000a      constitutional matters to the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Committee\u000d\u000a      (since 2010). Since joining the University of Ulster, he has also\u000d\u000a      submitted written evidence to Part II of the Silk Commission on\u000d\u000a      the implications of a Welsh legal jurisdiction (see source 8). Regarding\u000d\u000a      finance, and building on earlier submissions to such bodies as the Calman\u000a        Commission in Scotland, the Silk Commission in Wales, the Scottish\u000a        Parliament's Scotland Bill Committees and the Finance and\u000d\u000a        Personnel Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly, he has been\u000d\u000a      involved in a major IPPR project, `Devo More', with one report published\u000d\u000a      in January 2013 and another (Devo More and Welfare) due in February\u000d\u000a      2014. This research has led to his appointment to advise the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Conservatives' devolution commission. Trench is also participating in the\u000d\u000a      emergent debate in Northern Ireland, commenting at a launch of a paper\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action's\u000d\u000a        (NICVA) Centre for Economic Empowerment on the potential fiscal\u000d\u000a      powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Finance Minister Sammy Wilson\u000d\u000a      launched the report with both Trench and Daithi McKay, Chairperson of the\u000d\u000a      Finance and Personnel Committee as keynote speakers on the day (see source\u000d\u000a      9), and he has been a keynote speaker at the Northern Ireland Assembly as\u000d\u000a      part of the aforementioned Knowledge Exchange Seminar Series.\u000d\u000a    Collectively, this research has been consumed and used in deliberations\u000d\u000a      by Parliamentary Commissions, Parliamentary and Assembly Committees and\u000d\u000a      public policy think tanks.

Yet what is to be `finished' and what is the `business' are\u000d\u000a      matters of debate. Professor Robert Hazell once said that the gaping hole\u000d\u000a      in the devolution settlement is England. This is not only a matter of\u000d\u000a      English governance alone but also of England's relationship with the other\u000d\u000a      devolved regions, its position within the UK as a whole and the integrity\u000d\u000a      of the UK in terms of financing devolution. In tackling this omission, the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research for this case study was conducted by Professor\u000d\u000a      Arthur Aughey (appointed to Ulster in 1979), Professor Derek Birrell\u000d\u000a      (appointed to Ulster in 1969) and Professor Alan Trench (appointed to\u000d\u000a      Ulster in 2013) who continue to be in University of Ulster employment now.\u000d\u000a      Their findings help shape the current debates on the asymmetrical nature\u000d\u000a      of devolution in the UK, especially in relation to the government of\u000d\u000a      England and the divergent policy outcomes as a consequence of\u000d\u000a      administrative arrangements in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and\u000d\u000a      Wales. Aughey has concentrated mainly on English identity, Birrell on\u000d\u000a      comparative institutions and policy divergence, and Trench on framing a\u000d\u000a      financial model of stronger devolution sustained by shared interests and\u000d\u000a      structures as well as autonomous ones.\u000d\u000a    Aughey has published widely on the politics of England with support from\u000d\u000a      a British Academy Small Grant (2007: &#163;740, 1224R0065) as well as a\u000d\u000a      Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship (2008-2011: &#163;126,167, 1224R0072) and\u000d\u000a      the Foundation for Canadian Studies (2007-2013: &#163;13,847), 1234R0181). He\u000d\u000a      framed the issue originally in the chapter `Missing England' in Nationalism,\u000a        Devolution and the Challenge to the UK State (Pluto 2001). The idea\u000d\u000a      mooted in that chapter was developed in collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      Constitution Unit at UCL appearing in R Hazell (ed) The English\u000d\u000a        Question (MUP 2006) and a substantial part of a further chapter in R\u000d\u000a      Hazell (ed) Constitutional Futures Revisited (Palgrave 2008).\u000d\u000a      Subsequently, The Politics of Englishness (MUP 2007) (reference\u000a        1) was the first academic text which looked in depth at the debate\u000d\u000a      about Englishness, identity and nation in the period after devolution,\u000d\u000a      aspects of which were re-examined in The British Question (2013) (reference\u000a        2). An article in the journal Nations and Nationalism (2010)\u000d\u000a      related ideas from the monograph directly to the Campaign for an English\u000d\u000a      Parliament (reference 3). Key findings showed that there was a\u000d\u000a      growth in a sense of English identity without any consensus about how that\u000d\u000a      identity should or could be expressed institutionally and politically\u000d\u000a      within the Union. Dealing with the English question in the UK is one that\u000d\u000a      the coalition government identified in its programme for government,\u000d\u000a      establishing the Commission on the Consequences of Devolution for the\u000d\u000a        House of Commons (McKay Commission) to which Aughey contributed.\u000d\u000a    Birrell has carried out comparative research on the operation of devolved\u000d\u000a      government. In his book Direct Rule and the Governance of Northern\u000d\u000a        Ireland (MUP 2009) he makes a comparison between governance by\u000d\u000a      Westminster's Direct Rule in Northern Ireland and governance under\u000d\u000a      devolved arrangements (reference 6). In particular this covers the\u000d\u000a      legislative and parliamentary processes, including the territorial scope\u000d\u000a      of legislation enacted at Westminster as well as the local system of\u000d\u000a      public administration. Birrell has also undertaken a major study comparing\u000d\u000a      the operation of devolution between Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\u000d\u000a      Comparing Devolved Governance (Palgrave 2012) examines the extent\u000d\u000a      to which there has been a movement towards greater procedural symmetry (reference\u000a        4). The book analyses the powers, resources and operation of the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Parliament and the two Assemblies as well as the operation of\u000d\u000a      government departments, quangos and local government. Inter-governmental\u000a        cooperation is identified as a new aspect of governance (reference 6).\u000d\u000a      Related academic work has had a focus on policy outcomes, policy making,\u000d\u000a      policy capacity and public sector reform. Key findings have been to detect\u000d\u000a      a growing similarity in the operation of the institutions of governance\u000d\u000a      between the three devolved systems in the period 2007-12 except in a few\u000d\u000a      core areas such as executive government in Northern Ireland. At the same\u000d\u000a      time there has been a continuing divergence in policy outcomes in some key\u000d\u000a      areas between the devolved administrations and also between the devolved\u000d\u000a      administrations and England. Also identified is an emerging area of\u000d\u000a      controversy about overlaps between powers exercised by devolved\u000d\u000a      governments and UK government.\u000d\u000a    Trench's work since his arrival at Ulster has built on his earlier\u000d\u000a      research on intergovernmental relations and devolution. He was the editor\u000d\u000a      of and contributor to `The State of the Nation' series which\u000d\u000a      documented the development of devolution in the UK. His recent work has\u000d\u000a      focused chiefly on constitutional developments relating to Wales, debates\u000d\u000a      about devolution finance, fiscal devolution and the Barnett formula in the\u000d\u000a      context of Northern Ireland, and developing a model of enhanced devolution\u000d\u000a      for Scotland within the UK. His findings suggest that present UK financial\u000d\u000a      arrangements relying on the Barnett formula are no longer fit for\u000d\u000a      purpose and require significant changes not just on an administrative\u000d\u000a      level but also by way of greater tax raising powers by devolved\u000d\u000a      governments. Reconciling greater reliance on own tax resources, with UK\u000d\u000a      wide equity, involves a delicate balancing act and Trench's research shows\u000d\u000a      how this might be done.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1729","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3277605","Name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Morrow's research has been extensively disseminated through multiple\u000d\u000a      interviews on local, national and international broadcasts and through the\u000d\u000a      publication of op-ed pieces in local and national newspapers (BBC TV and\u000d\u000a      Radio, AP\/Reuters, Guardian, Irish Times, Belfast Telegraph, Irish News,\u000d\u000a      Newsletter (see source 10). Through the active dissemination of the\u000d\u000a      research and using the media as impact generating interfaces, Morrow's\u000d\u000a      work has impacted on the tone, language and framing of debates around\u000d\u000a      sectarianism, political division, peace building and reconciliation in\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on Public Policy: The issue of a shared future is now\u000d\u000a      central to the concerns of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Northern\u000a        Ireland Executive. Commitments to a shared and better future have\u000d\u000a      been integrated into the Northern Ireland Programme for Government\u000d\u000a      (2008-11) and into the current Programme for Government (2011-2014). More\u000d\u000a      specifically, in 2008 the Department of Education in Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a      appointed Duncan Morrow to an advisory group to review current practice\u000d\u000a      and to advise government on its new policy for Community Relations,\u000d\u000a      Education and Diversity (CRED). In order to articulate more effectively\u000d\u000a      the wider scope of the new policy, from existing community relation policy\u000d\u000a      in education, the new policy drew heavily from the original EDI principles\u000d\u000a      and is now premised on the interdependence between equality, good\u000d\u000a      relations and human rights, including UNCRC and commitments in the Good\u000d\u000a      Friday, St Andrews and Hillsborough Agreements while acknowledging the\u000d\u000a      greater diversity of our community. This policy has now been adopted and\u000d\u000a      implemented across all schools in Northern Ireland. Thanks to these policy\u000d\u000a      interventions, Duncan Morrow has also been an expert advisor to the US\u000d\u000a        Government, the Scottish Government, the Northern\u000d\u000a        Ireland Executive and local government on community relation\u000d\u000a      issues. The Chief Executive Officer of Belfast City Council noted that:\u000d\u000a      \"For over a decade we have relied directly and repeatedly on the academic\u000d\u000a      research, policy relevance and practical advice of Duncan Morrow in a wide\u000d\u000a      variety of areas\" (see source 1). Extending from this and \"in light of his\u000d\u000a      research, practical experience and independence\" he was appointed by the\u000d\u000a      Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs to drive forward the Ministerial\u000a        Advisory Committee on Tackling Sectarianism in Scotland (see source\u000d\u000a      2). An example of his impact at an international level was referenced in\u000d\u000a      the recent correspondence from the White House in relation to\u000d\u000a      advice given to the US Government on Policy in Northern Ireland. The US\u000d\u000a      Consulate General noted recently that he believed Morrow's work and\u000d\u000a      discussions with senior White House officials in Washington in the Spring\u000d\u000a      of 2013 had played a part in the \"issuance and tone\" of two statements\u000d\u000a      released by both President Barak Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry\u000d\u000a      in Washington in April 2013, just prior to the anniversary of the Good\u000d\u000a      Friday Agreement, on the US policy position (see source 3).\u000d\u000a    Impacts on Local and International Funding Streams: The Morrow et\u000d\u000a      al. principles of Equity, Diversity and Interdependence\u000d\u000a      have been established as core principles of the Community Relations\u000d\u000a      Council since 2000 and applied to all of its work. This commitment was\u000d\u000a      confirmed through the new CRC Strategic Plan (2011-2014). Since 2008, the\u000d\u000a      principles have been applied to funding schemes of an estimated &#163;20m per\u000d\u000a      annum operated by or through the Community Relations Council (see source\u000d\u000a      4). The European Union PEACE III programme (2007-2013) with a\u000d\u000a      value of 333m Euros also incorporated the principles of EDI into its core\u000d\u000a      objectives to allocate its funding and sought to promote \"A normal, civic\u000d\u000a      society, in which all individuals are considered as equals, where\u000d\u000a      differences are resolved through dialogue in the public sphere, and where\u000d\u000a      all people are treated impartially. A society where there is equity,\u000d\u000a      respect for diversity and recognition of our interdependence\" (see source\u000d\u000a      5).\u000d\u000a    Impact on Culture and Society: The research has enhanced the\u000d\u000a      cultural understandings on particularly sensitive issues in Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland, such as parading and dealing with the past through commemorative\u000d\u000a      activities. The EDI principles were fed through into the Ashdown\u000d\u000a        Commission on Parading in Northern Ireland appointed by the Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland Office when Duncan Morrow was tasked as a political advisor to the\u000d\u000a      group. The interim report of the Commission in 2008 provided an outline\u000d\u000a      basis for the Executive proposals for legislation in 2010 (see source 6).\u000d\u000a      It has also been influential within the Irish Football Association's\u000d\u000a        (IFA) `Football for All' project which uses football as a conduit to\u000d\u000a      promote peace and reconciliation, develop partnerships and build capacity\u000d\u000a      within clubs, fans and communities. Founded originally in 2000, the\u000d\u000a      project involves 850 clubs, 1,000 coaches, 600 referees, 15,000 players,\u000d\u000a      6,000 people with special needs, 15,000 women and girls and 8,000\u000d\u000a      schoolchildren each year. Morrow was appointed as a member of the Football\u000d\u000a      for All Advisory Panel in 2000 to help the group embed the EDI principles\u000d\u000a      in their work. A hugely successful initiative, the IFA were invited by the\u000d\u000a      Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) in 2012 to present\u000d\u000a      on their community relations activities at the European governing body's\u000d\u000a      inaugural corporate social responsibility workshop in Sarajevo, Bosnia and\u000d\u000a      Herzegovina. It was highly commended for significance and impact beyond\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland: \"Over the last ten years, the Football For All Project\u000d\u000a      has transformed the atmosphere at Northern Ireland international football\u000d\u000a      games creating a fun, safe and family friendly environment,\" said the EU\u000a        Commissioner for Regional Policy. \"Bringing together key partners\u000d\u000a      from both the private and public sectors, the project has played a central\u000d\u000a      role to get real progress in community relations in football ...Not only\u000d\u000a      has Football For All made a meaningful difference locally, but we also see\u000d\u000a      it as a model which other countries around Europe can learn from and\u000d\u000a      aspire to\" (see source 7).\u000d\u000a    Impact on Practitioners and Professional Services: In May 2013,\u000d\u000a      two days of talks were held in Cardiff involving senior Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a      police officers, politicians and representatives from loyalist and\u000d\u000a      republican communities in Belfast. As a co-organiser and facilitator of\u000d\u000a      these high level political negotiations on peace-building and policing,\u000d\u000a      Morrow used the EDI principles as the underpinning framework for the\u000d\u000a      negotiations and discussion. This was acknowledged by Police Service\u000d\u000a        of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Assistant Chief Constable who said \"Most\u000d\u000a      importantly, he developed a process for engaging police with community and\u000d\u000a      political leaders which culminated with important talks in Cardiff in May\u000d\u000a      2013\". These talks then led to a joint declaration &#8212; the Cardiff\u000d\u000a        Declaration &#8212; which set the agreed framework for subsequent dialogue\u000d\u000a      between politicians and the police over contentious issues (see source 8).\u000d\u000a    Impact on Conflict Transformation in Local Government: Belfast City\u000d\u000a        Council Good Relations Plan\u000d\u000a    Belfast City Council has adopted the Morrow et al. principles of equity,\u000d\u000a      diversity and interdependence into its good relations planning. The Belfast\u000a        City Council Good Relations Plan (2007-2011) stated \"We are\u000d\u000a      committed to the principles of equity, diversity and interdependence and\u000d\u000a      have agreed that these should be firmly anchored and integrated within our\u000d\u000a      policies and programmes\" and defines them in terms of the original\u000d\u000a      definition developed in 1997. In 2011, the most recent Council plan\u000d\u000a      states: \"The principles of equity, diversity and interdependence should be\u000d\u000a      mainstreamed into all of our activities, policies, structures and\u000d\u000a      procedures, recognising that diverse groups are interdependent and basing\u000d\u000a      relationships amongst them on agreed principles of fairness and equality\"\u000d\u000a      (see source 9).\u000d\u000a    Reach: The reach of the research has extended far beyond policy\u000d\u000a      makers and donors to the public sector as indicated above. A range of\u000d\u000a      groups have integrated the principles of equity, diversity and\u000d\u000a      interdependence (EDI) into their ethos and values documented through their\u000d\u000a      operational plans and programmes of activities including: Youth Link &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      inter-church youth service for Northern Ireland which was established by\u000d\u000a      the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Methodist Church in\u000d\u000a      Ireland and the Presbyterian Church in Ireland in 1991 and exists to\u000d\u000a      provide support and training for youth workers and community relations\u000d\u000a      experiences for young people; Hazelwood Community Partnership (an\u000d\u000a      interagency project to support the community in building good relations by\u000d\u000a      delivering practical responses to all issues arising from community\u000d\u000a      tensions in the greater Whitewell area in North Belfast); Lurgan Town\u000d\u000a      Youth project (a town based approach aiming to build a shared agenda\u000d\u000a      educationally, socially, politically, civically and economically); and the\u000d\u000a      Rural Community Network (a regional voluntary organisation established by\u000d\u000a      community groups from rural areas in 1991 to articulate the voice of rural\u000d\u000a      communities on issues relating to poverty, disadvantage and equality).\u000d\u000a    Significance: The overall significance of the development of the\u000d\u000a    Morrow et al. equity, diversity and interdependence (EDI) principles lies in\u000d\u000a    the substantial influence which it has had in shaping and framing the\u000d\u000a    discourse on the specific of the processes of peace-building and\u000d\u000a    reconciliation in a society emerging from conflict.

Morrow et al (1997) demonstrated that the absence of an\u000d\u000a      overarching conceptual framework stifled government policy and so\u000d\u000a      subsequently developed a ground breaking model of community relations\u000d\u000a      engagement to be mainstreamed into government policy (around equity,\u000d\u000a        diversity and interdependence). Following two major government\u000d\u000a      reviews of community relations in 2002 and 2003-5, these research findings\u000d\u000a      were adopted as central to public policy and resource allocation, and\u000d\u000a      reconfigured as `A Shared Future'.\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, the core concepts of Morrow et al's work have been explicitly\u000d\u000a      integrated into the vision and values of many policies and practices\u000d\u000a      around reconciliation, community relations and a shared future\u000d\u000a      demonstrating a continuing, cascading impact at local, regional, national,\u000d\u000a      European and international levels.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Ulster\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Ulster (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Ulster","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Northern Ireland","UKPRN":10007807}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2653822","Name":"Cardiff"},{"GeoNamesId":"3191281","Name":"Sarajevo"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Morrow's work was completed as part of a series of funded grants from the\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland Office (NIO), the European Regional Development Fund\u000d\u000a      (ERDF), Leverhulme, Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and Atlantic\u000d\u000a      Philanthropies.

Morrow acted as a key member of a\u000d\u000a      University of Ulster research team along with Eyben (1995-2003) and Wilson\u000d\u000a      (1974-2013) that produced influential and ground breaking work on\u000d\u000a      community relations between 1997 and 2003. Morrow was then seconded to the\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland Community Relation Council as their CEO\u000d\u000a      (2003-2012) to apply the methodologies developed by the original research\u000d\u000a      team. Between 2008 and 2012, Morrow published further research in the area\u000d\u000a      that fused the real world knowledge gained on secondment with the academic\u000d\u000a      expertise in the subject area. He returned to the University of Ulster in\u000d\u000a      January 2012 to continue to develop practical applications of the research\u000d\u000a      and to act as a conduit between academia and the community in his new role\u000d\u000a      as Director of Community Engagement at the University of Ulster.\u000d\u000a      This research (1997-2012) has focused specifically on the nature, impact\u000d\u000a      and contribution of cross community activity undertaken in the context of\u000d\u000a      sectarian division arguing that mainstreaming community relations activity\u000d\u000a      into government policy is imperative for political and social progress.\u000d\u000a      Specifically, the research developed the principles and frameworks to\u000d\u000a      translate often piecemeal and ad-hoc community relations work (usually\u000d\u000a      undertaken by women's groups, youth organisations and the unemployed at\u000d\u000a      the time) into public and social institutions. Section 4 of this case\u000d\u000a      study demonstrates where and how such activity has been mainstreamed as a\u000d\u000a      consequence of this programme of research.\u000d\u000a    Initial research funding from the Northern Ireland Office's Central\u000d\u000a      Community Relations Unit (Grant 1234-R-0014), led to the publication of A\u000d\u000a        Worthwhile Venture? Investing in Equity, Diversity and Interdependence\u000d\u000a      (1997). This landmark report found that low levels of community relations\u000d\u000a      activity across a range of sectors were compounded by the absence of a\u000d\u000a      conceptual framework to effectively guide community relations work. In\u000d\u000a      response to this weakness, the researchers developed a set of foundational\u000d\u000a      principles that prepared the ground for the development of a value-led and\u000d\u000a      practical model defined as equity, the accommodation and\u000d\u000a      expression of diversity and interdependence. These came to\u000d\u000a      be known as the EDI principles, applied across the field,\u000d\u000a      extending in reach to the trade unions, public and voluntary sectors\u000d\u000a      including the Police Service of Northern Ireland, a range of district\u000d\u000a      councils, the Health Trusts and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland.\u000d\u000a      Further funding from the Northern Ireland Office in 2003 led to research\u000d\u000a      outputs which have advanced the intellectual arguments and practical\u000d\u000a      toolkits for the adoption of the EDI principles as cited in section 3.\u000d\u000a      More recently, Morrow developed, designed and managed a Peace Monitoring\u000d\u000a      project that considered the various manifestations of the EDI principles\u000d\u000a      in current community relations practice. This research was supported by\u000d\u000a      the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation\u000d\u000a      and was published in 2012 as the Northern Ireland Peace Monitor.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1984","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Informing security and intelligence practitioners\u000d\u000a    The `Landscapes' team led by Aldrich has worked nationally and\u000d\u000a      internationally to secure maximum impact of research findings among key\u000d\u000a      security and intelligence personnel (sources 1, 2, 3 and 10). A series of\u000d\u000a      bespoke workshops were held in the UK followed up with policy briefs for\u000d\u000a      the Ministry of Defence (15 December 2011); Cabinet Office (23 February\u000d\u000a      2012); Defence Advisory- Notice Committee (6 February 2012); Industry and\u000d\u000a      Parliament Trust (1 February 2012); Serious Organised Crime Agency (18\u000d\u000a      February 2013); and Space Geodesy Centre (20 January 2012).\u000d\u000a    Each workshop, attended by at least 20 people, was tailored to the\u000d\u000a      specific needs of the end-user. The DA-Committee, the body that gives\u000d\u000a      guidance on national security to the media, wanted to know how the CIA\u000d\u000a      deals with the press (source 1). The Committee noted that it faced similar\u000d\u000a      challenges to the CIA and resolved to initiate more cross-national\u000d\u000a      dialogue. SOCA requested advice on how it should combat negative press\u000d\u000a      portrayals of policing and resolved to consider the team's suggestion of\u000d\u000a      an official history (source 3). With SOCA being subsumed within the new\u000d\u000a      National Crime Agency (NCA) in October 2013, an official history was\u000d\u000a      regarded as a useful mechanism for institutional memory and a valuable\u000d\u000a      tool for knowledge transfer to the new agency.\u000d\u000a    To explore European policy-transfer, two workshops on `PR and Secret\u000d\u000a      Services' were held with the Netherlands Foreign Office and the Hague\u000d\u000a      Centre for Strategic Studies on 29 June 2012. Here, the user was struck by\u000d\u000a      the team's discussion of how the internet represented a rich harvest of\u000d\u000a      `open source' material. As a result of this, Aldrich has been invited to\u000d\u000a      join the Netherlands accreditation organisation (NVAO) with the purpose of\u000d\u000a      developing a new multi-language training course in intelligence for the\u000d\u000a      Dutch Staff College. Aldrich played a key role in alerting intelligence\u000d\u000a      officers to the value of the internet for intelligence work. Workshops\u000d\u000a      have also been held with the CIA and with the Geneva Centre for the\u000d\u000a      Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF) (source 4). DCAF have\u000d\u000a      commissioned the team to produce `Toolkit 10', which will incorporate our\u000d\u000a      findings into their security reform handbook Overseeing Intelligence\u000d\u000a        Services: A Toolkit. Finally, since September 2012, the findings of\u000d\u000a      Aldrich's research have also fed directly into the work of a consultative\u000d\u000a      committee designed to frame new security mechanisms within the UK in the\u000d\u000a      context of possible constitutional change. Documentary evidence of this is\u000d\u000a      available on request (source 6).\u000d\u000a    Shaping public policy debates about declassification\u000d\u000a    In November 2010, Aldrich succeeded Lord Hennessy as one of two academic\u000d\u000a      advisers serving on the Cabinet Office Consultative Group on Security and\u000d\u000a      Intelligence Records. The group, which meets at six-month intervals,\u000d\u000a      considers requests by researchers for the declassification of official\u000d\u000a      material and is thus a vital mechanism through which scholars can lobby\u000d\u000a      government. Aldrich has secured further releases on the financial control\u000d\u000a      of intelligence (e.g. TNA CAB 301). He has also advised on patterns for\u000d\u000a      future releases and the impact of the shift to a twenty-year rule in the\u000d\u000a      UK. Moreover, he has used his research on CIA record management to alert\u000d\u000a      UK government departments to declassification developments in the US. This\u000d\u000a      has helped officials in London to better understand where UK release\u000d\u000a      policy sits in a global context (source 5). Specifically, he has informed\u000d\u000a      GCHQ about releases on joint UK-US operations by the National Security\u000d\u000a      Agency (NSA).\u000d\u000a    Enhancing public awareness of and attitudes towards secrecy\u000d\u000a    The team has shaped international public understanding of intelligence,\u000d\u000a      security, and secrecy (sources 6, 7, 8 and 10). The project mounted the\u000d\u000a      largest ever conference on the CIA, held at the East Midlands Conference\u000d\u000a      Centre. All nineteen panels and plenaries were recorded by Backdoor\u000d\u000a      Broadcasting and the conference, including the post-panel discussions, can\u000d\u000a      be `attended' for free via a dedicated web-site. According to statistics\u000d\u000a      provided by Backdoor Broadcasting Company, this website has received 4.75\u000d\u000a      million `hits' since its launch in May 2011. The number of downloads of\u000d\u000a      material produced by Aldrich and Moran from the website stands at 36,690\u000d\u000a      (July 2013). The intelligence resources pages at Warwick have received\u000d\u000a      over 240,220 visitors (July 2013).\u000d\u000a    In the service of public engagement and the enhancement of cultural\u000d\u000a      understandings of espionage, between 2011-12 Moran served as principal\u000d\u000a      historical consultant to the International Spy Museum in Washington DC,\u000d\u000a      working on the exhibition `Exquisitely Evil: 50 Years of James Bond\u000d\u000a      Villains' (source 6). The Museum's chartered responsibility is to inform\u000d\u000a      the public about the fact, not fiction, of espionage. Moran's research was\u000d\u000a      instrumental in convincing the Museum that spy fiction should be taken\u000d\u000a      seriously, since it provides the public with a unique, if not necessarily\u000d\u000a      accurate, window onto clandestine security relations. Moran's idea that\u000d\u000a      public perceptions about intelligence are disproportionately influenced by\u000d\u000a      fictive ideas derived from popular culture is the overriding message of\u000d\u000a      the exhibition. On the basis of his research, Moran devised the\u000d\u000a      intellectual framework of the exhibition; selected artefacts from the Bond\u000d\u000a      film archive; and wrote many of the sidebars. During launch week, he gave\u000d\u000a      media interviews (Fox News, Reuters, France 24) and spoke at a reception\u000d\u000a      to mark the opening, held at the British Ambassador's Residence in\u000d\u000a      Georgetown. The exhibition has been widely reviewed, and has increased\u000d\u000a      attendance at the Museum by 14%.\u000d\u000a    To improve public understanding of secrecy, the team has produced a\u000d\u000a      number of influential cultural artefacts (sources 7 and 8). For example,\u000d\u000a      Aldrich and Moran's research led to two 30-minute BBC Radio 4\u000d\u000a      documentaries for `Document'. One explored a fracture in Anglo-US\u000d\u000a      intelligence and the second revealed that Britain's greatest post-war\u000d\u000a      secret, the existence of GCHQ, was nearly blown by an inebriated\u000d\u000a      journalist in 1951; the latter was reported by the Telegraph and\u000d\u000a      featured on the BBC homepage. Aldrich's research on the alleged traitor,\u000d\u000a      Lord Sempill, was also the subject of an hour-long BBC 2 documentary,\u000d\u000a      which featured Aldrich extensively.

This led agencies to regulate the writings of journalists,\u000d\u000a      historians and memoirists. Aldrich's work served as the basis for a more\u000d\u000a      widely sourced rendering of the subject by Dr Moran, in his Cambridge\u000d\u000a      University Press monograph Classified: Secrecy and the State in Modern\u000d\u000a        Britain (2013). Keen to examine this phenomenon beyond the British\u000d\u000a      context, Aldrich and Moran made two successful bids to the AHRC to study\u000d\u000a      information management by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); the\u000d\u000a      second bid was awarded explicitly for impact activities and has since been\u000d\u000a      commended in the AHRC's 2011-12 Impact Report. Subsequent successful bids\u000d\u000a      to the Leverhulme Trust and the British Academy have allowed for\u000d\u000a      additional case studies of secrecy in the context of press, film, memoir\u000d\u000a      and freedom of information legislation. For example, Moran's on-going\u000d\u000a      British Academy research considers how an obsession with practices of\u000d\u000a      concealment pervaded and paralysed the Nixon administration.\u000d\u000a    Taken together, these projects have produced significant research\u000d\u000a      findings, which can be summarised as six core conclusions and\u000d\u000a      recommendations:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Secrecy is often counter-productive, causing more problems than it\u000d\u000a        solves. By failing to communicate to the public, the activities of\u000d\u000a        intelligence services can be misunderstood; worse, conspiracy theories\u000d\u000a        harden and become accepted as `fact'.\u000d\u000a      The new intelligence eco-system of the twenty-first century requires\u000d\u000a        public confidence to function. During the Cold War, intelligence\u000d\u000a        belonged to specialist high-level government agencies working mostly\u000d\u000a        against a foreign enemy. This landscape has changed. Concerns about\u000d\u000a        resilience and the arrival of `Contest' (the UK counter-terrorism\u000d\u000a        strategy) mean that intelligence is owned more broadly, including local\u000d\u000a        government, private corporations such as airlines and banks, even\u000d\u000a        individual citizens who are now expected to report suspicious behaviour.\u000d\u000a        This requires new levels of public confidence.\u000d\u000a      The vacuum that is left by secret services failing to communicate to\u000d\u000a        the public has been filled by journalists, historians and popular\u000d\u000a        culture, including Hollywood. This is often disadvantageous, since\u000d\u000a        outsiders, working with limited information and sometimes with axes to\u000d\u000a        grind, often produce sensationalised versions of events.\u000d\u000a      By contrast, well-informed journalism and contemporary history offers\u000d\u000a        an important adjunct to the accountability offered by political\u000d\u000a        committees and the judiciary. While government has been reluctant to\u000d\u000a        offer journalists a recognised place in the audit trail, the reality is\u000d\u000a        that - working with whistle-blowers - they are the shock troops of\u000d\u000a        accountability.\u000d\u000a      Recognising that it is problematic for secret services to leave their\u000d\u000a        narratives to private hands, they should proactively engage with museums\u000d\u000a        and other forms of cultural production. Official histories, especially\u000d\u000a        when carried out by independent academics with full access, represent a\u000d\u000a        valuable mechanism for enhancing openness.\u000d\u000a      Social networking, whistle-blowing and new media heralds a more\u000d\u000a        transparent society and a significant decline in state secrecy.\u000d\u000a        Government, and especially secret government, is ill- prepared for this.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1985","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2420477","Name":"Guinea"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2275384","Name":"Liberia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Breslin has used his extensive knowledge of Chinese politics and\u000a      international relations to inform and advise a range of non-academic\u000a      beneficiaries including policy-makers, businesses, journalists and the\u000a      wider public. His expertise has been sought both formally and informally\u000a      and he has become established as one of the leading providers of advice to\u000a      national and international government officials on issues around UK and EU\u000a      relations with China. He regularly engages in and helps to shape public\u000a      debate via contributions to major international media outlets such as The\u000a        Global Times, The Guardian and The Independent.\u000a    Informing UK government policy towards China\u000a    Breslin has harnessed the key insights of his underpinning research to\u000a      inform and shape the UK government's policy towards China via sustained\u000a      expert briefings delivered directly to Ministers and officials (sources 1,\u000a      2, 3 and 6). In 2010 Breslin provided oral evidence based on his EU-China\u000a      research to the House of Lords Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee. A report\u000a      entitled `Stars and Dragons: The EU and China' (2010) was published, which\u000a      features Breslin's commentary on the decline in Chinese interest in EU\u000a      governance relative to individual EU Member States (source 2).\u000a    In October 2012 Breslin gave a briefing on `Major Policy Challenges for\u000a      the New China Leadership' to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. This\u000a      fed the findings of his research directly into elite UK thinking about the\u000a      political and economic challenges facing the new Chinese leadership. The\u000a      Chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee described the presentation\u000a      as \"brilliant\" and \"essential\" to the work of the Committee (cited in\u000a      source 5). In the same month, Breslin also delivered a presentation on\u000a      `China Engages Africa: Who (or What) is China and What does it Want?' to\u000a      the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). This informed FCO thinking\u000a      around how the UK might find ways of working productively with China on\u000a      joint development projects in Africa (source 3). The event led to\u000a      subsequent participation in policy discussions, a new FCO strategy on\u000a      responding to China's relationship with Africa and a policy conference in\u000a      Beijing on Chinese involvement in the Maxone River Development Zone\u000a      including the Ambassadors of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia (source 3).\u000a      In July 2013 Breslin was invited to act as one of the expert witnesses for\u000a      the Foreign Affairs Committee's one-off evidence session on government\u000a      policy towards China in view of the leadership change, Beijing's foreign\u000a      policies and Chinese overseas economic activities. The Chair of the\u000a      Committee said that Breslin's evidence \"greatly enhanced the Committee's\u000a      understanding\" of these issues, \"informed Members' thinking\" about them\u000a      and \"influenced any future work of the Committee\" on UK policy towards\u000a      China (source 1).\u000a    One of the primary impact mechanisms through which Breslin has informed\u000a      UK policy debates is via his Associate Fellowship of Chatham House, London\u000a      (source 5). In 2011 the University of Pennsylvania's Global Go-To Think\u000a      Tanks Survey ranked Chatham House as the world's number one think tank\u000a      outside the US. Through his Fellowship, Breslin has prepared numerous\u000a      policy briefing papers and presentations based on the findings of his\u000a      underpinning research. He has shared these findings with a wide range of\u000a      key stakeholders in debates about UK policy towards China. In 2010 Breslin\u000a      was invited to give the prestigious Chatham House `Director's Nominee's\u000a      Breakfast' talk on `Domestic Drivers of China's Global Role' to a\u000a      specially-invited audience of leading policy-makers and business people.\u000a      He has produced policy briefings that are available online and in hard\u000a      copy on request including:\u000a    \u000a      (2010) `Online Chinese Nationalism' (with Simon Chen)\u000a        http:\/\/www.chathamhouse.org\/publications\/papers\/view\/109458\u000a        (accessed 30\/9\/13)\u000a      (2011) `The soft notion of China's soft power'\u000a        http:\/\/www.chathamhouse.org\/publications\/papers\/view\/109577\u000a        (accessed 30\/9\/13)\u000a      (2012) `China and the International Human Rights System' (with Sonya\u000a        Sceats)\u000a        http:\/\/www.chathamhouse.org\/research\/international-law\/current-projects\/china-and-\u000a          international-human-rights-system (accessed 30\/9\/13)\u000a    \u000a    The latter, which has also been translated into Chinese, was launched on\u000a      29 October 2012 at Chatham House to an audience of over 100 invited guests\u000a      with a pre-launch at the Houses of Parliament (source 4). It was described\u000a      by the Amnesty International Representative to the United Nations in\u000a      Geneva and former Canadian diplomat as \"a must read for anyone doing UN\u000a      human rights work\" (cited in source 5). The Director of Chatham House\u000a      acknowledges that \"we benefit enormously from [Breslin's] involvement in\u000a      events [...] and in the support that [he] provides overall to our on-going\u000a      programme of research\" (source 5).\u000a    Shaping international policy and practitioner debates on China\u000a    Breslin has shaped international policy and practitioner debates on\u000a      Chinese domestic and international politics through the organisation of\u000a      high-profile events designed to stimulate knowledge exchange between\u000a      academics and policy-makers (sources 8, 9 and 10). At the 2011 launch\u000a      event of the GR:EEN programme in Brussels he spoke alongside the Chief\u000a      Economist (DG Trade) and DG Research and Innovation from the European\u000a      Commission and the Chief Economist from the World Trade Organization. In\u000a      direct response to requests from foreign policy experts in the Commission,\u000a      GR:EEN organised a special workshop where an invited group of specialists\u000a      from the BRICS discussed with the Bureau of European Policy Advisors\u000a      (BEPA) their views of the EU's global role in April 2011. In 2012 Breslin\u000a      was asked to talk to the Caribbean Council (a specialist trade advisory\u000a      and public affairs company) on China's growing interests in the region\u000a      (source 7). As a result of this meeting, and having read a number of\u000a      Breslin's scholarly publications, in January 2013 the Council decided to\u000a      set up a specialist China Discussion Group including members from the\u000a      private sector, government and NGOs (source 7). Breslin was invited to\u000a      become one of the core members and organisers.\u000a    Breslin has worked extensively with influential European think tanks to\u000a      provide expert briefings and analysis (source 8). He has given policy\u000a      briefings at two think tanks associated with the Italian Ministry of\u000a      Foreign Affairs. In April 2012 he presented on the nature of China and the\u000a      multipolar world at a workshop on `The West and the BRICs' at the Italian\u000a        Istituto Affari Internazionali. He has also delivered two\u000a      presentations at the Istituto per gli Studi di Politica Internazionale\u000a      (IPSI) in Milan, the second of which has been published as an ISPI policy\u000a      paper on China and the Arab Awakening.\u000a    Breslin is also the Key Expert in Politics for the Europe China Research\u000a      and Advice Network (ECRAN), a programme run by Chatham House designed to\u000a      further enhance the capacity of European policy-makers to monitor and\u000a      assess current developments in China and their impact on the EU and on\u000a      EU-China relations (source 5). This entails identifying areas of interest\u000a      to the European External Action Service (EEAS), commissioning papers and\u000a      evaluating reports prior to their submission. The EEAS also request short\u000a      papers and briefings. In addition to these core functions, in 2011 Breslin\u000a      spoke at an ECRAN policy event in Berlin attended by representatives from\u000a      the German Council of Foreign Relations and the German Ambassador to China\u000a      on the foreign policy objectives of the Chinese leadership. This was\u000a      followed in 2012 by a presentation at an event to accompany the EU-China\u000a      Strategic Dialogue on how Chinese conceptions of the global order\u000a      influence policy towards Europe. In January 2013 Breslin was invited to\u000a      brief the EEAS Asia team on the rise of nationalism in China and the\u000a      implications for EU politics.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact of Professor Breslin's research has spanned two programmes of\u000a      activity: 1) informing UK policy debates about EU-China relations by\u000a      engaging with Government and Opposition members; and 2) shaping debates\u000a      about Chinese politics among international practitioners through European\u000a      and East Asian policy networks.

He argued that, in a relatively short\u000a      period, the growth of investment to China and resulting increase in\u000a      Chinese trade had reconfigured the East Asian regional economy and was\u000a      altering global financial and resource flows. The project focused on the\u000a      interplay between domestic politics in China and the transition from\u000a      socialism on the one hand, and the on-going evolution of global production\u000a      networks on the other. The research findings demonstrated that while\u000a      events in China have considerable global significance, this importance\u000a      does not necessarily equate with the `power' that some already ascribe to\u000a      China. While recognising that global economic integration has contributed\u000a      to the reduction of poverty, it also pointed to the emergence of new\u000a      social cleavages and the changing basis of communist party rule.\u000a    Since 2007 Breslin's programme of research has focused primarily on the\u000a      state's management of economic and social change, and how these domestic\u000a      dynamics influence China's international behaviour. This includes\u000a      disaggregating different dimensions of China's growing external influence\u000a      &#8212; both material and ideational (including the concept of `soft power') &#8212;\u000a      and considering how these factors inform Chinese preferences within the\u000a      East Asian region, relationships with other developing states and\u000a      perceptions of the legitimacy of the current global order. It also entails\u000a      emphasising the increasing diversity of both interests and actors in\u000a      China's international interactions. This agenda has been pursued along two\u000a      related axes: i) Chinese political economy in the context of the 2008\u000a      financial crisis; and ii) the implications of China's growing economic\u000a      reach and assertive foreign policy for international relations more\u000a      generally.\u000a    Chinese responses to the global financial crisis (both in terms of policy\u000a      responses and also perceptions of Chinese power) provide an ideal context\u000a      to study these issues. China's performance during the crisis relative to\u000a      other (Western) states has led many to ask if China provides a better\u000a      `model' of development than Western paradigms. It has also resulted in a\u000a      stronger self-confidence in China in asserting and defending `core'\u000a      interests and calling for changes to the distribution of global power.\u000a      Nevertheless, there remains a reluctance to take on further global\u000a      leadership roles and within China itself there is a renewed focus on\u000a      long-term structural economic problems that need to be addressed.\u000a    The second stream of research has been specifically policy related work\u000a      on Chinese global reach and the political, economic and security\u000a      challenges this poses for EU-China relations in particular. Between 2006\u000a      and 2008 Breslin was a member of a six-party consortium awarded &#8364;400,000\u000a      under the EU FP6 programme to work on EU-Asia relations. In 2011 Breslin\u000a      was included in a successful &#8364;2 million bid from Chatham House to act as\u000a      the Politics expert for the EU-China Research and Advice Network (ECRAN).\u000a      This project was designed to enhance European policy-makers' understanding\u000a      of development in China and runs through to 2014. In addition, from 2011\u000a      Breslin has acted as Senior Scientist of `Global Re-Ordering: Evolution\u000a      through European Networks' (GR:EEN), an FP7 funded programme hosted at\u000a      Warwick involving 16 international universities and think tanks. Breslin's\u000a      own research is integral to the project and focuses on changing\u000a      conceptions of security in China, Chinese views of multi-polarity and\u000a      EU-China relations.\u000a    In summary, Breslin's underpinning research has yielded the following\u000a      conclusions, which form the basis of his impact work among UK policy\u000a      makers and international policy-making communities:\u000a    \u000a      Domestically, there is an increasingly diverse constellation of actors\u000a        and interests shaping Chinese foreign policy. There has been a decline\u000a        in the importance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs while economic\u000a        institutions and companies are becoming more influential in guiding\u000a        foreign policy preferences. Western policy makers need to understand\u000a        this complexity in order to reflect upon and update their relations with\u000a        China.\u000a      Externally, Chinese actors are evermore central to international\u000a        relations, particularly in the Latin American and Caribbean contexts.\u000a        This poses a new set of challenges to existing EU and US powers in those\u000a        regions and security relations in South East Asia. Western powers have a\u000a        diminishing ability to promote favoured policies in view of China's\u000a        global rise.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1986","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"934841","Name":"Swaziland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research listed above has achieved impact since 2008 via\u000a      the uptake of the Warwick Commissions and the work of CSGR across three\u000a      main contexts: 1) influencing Australian trade policy; 2) shaping public\u000a      policy debates about global trade and financial regulation; and 3)\u000a      informing practitioner agendas.\u000a    Influencing Australian trade policy\u000a    The Report of the First Warwick Commission energised national and\u000a      international public policy debates about the future of global trade\u000a      governance in the WTO in the wake of the failure of the Doha Round\u000a      negotiations (sources 1, 2, 3 and 5).

In September 2008 a review\u000a      of trade policy by the Australian Government adopted the Commission's\u000a      Recommendations. The Mortimer Report, entitled Winning in World\u000a        Markets: Review of Export Policies and Programs, acknowledged the\u000a      salience of the Commission's analysis and was particularly supportive of\u000a      the proposal that `critical mass' decision-making should be considered in\u000a      order to speed up negotiations at the WTO. The Mortimer Report also\u000a      supported the Commission's recommendation that the WTO's temporary\u000a      Transparency Mechanism for Regional Trade Agreements be made permanent. In\u000a      2008 Higgott gave briefings to senior Australian trade officials and\u000a      politicians in Canberra. The Minister for Trade subsequently wrote about\u000a      the work of the Warwick Commission as follows: \"The Warwick Commission's\u000a      Report is timely and I applaud the Commission's contribution to the\u000a      debate.

On 3 June 2008 Higgott gave evidence to the House of\u000a      Lords European Sub-Committee A (Economic and Financial Affairs and\u000a      International Trade) Inquiry into EU Trade Policy (source 2). The\u000a      Committee's Report, entitled `Developments in EU Trade Policy' (London:\u000a      HMSO, 5 December 2008) endorses \"[...] the Warwick Commission's\u000a      recommendation in favour of the introduction of `critical mass' voting at\u000a      the WTO as a reform which would speed up decision-making and\u000a      agenda-setting at the WTO\". Furthermore, one Member of Sub-Committee A,\u000a      said: \"May I congratulate you on this Report [...] Warwick has invented a\u000a      marvellous process for linking academics [...] and the policy world. So\u000a      much good social science work goes on in universities and it never gets\u000a      near the policy world [...] This is a marvellous model [...] you had the\u000a      WTO on your Commission [...] It is terrific\". A further indication of the\u000a      impact of the First Warwick Commission is that the Report won Gold at the\u000a      2008 Chartered Institute of Public Relations Pride Awards for the best\u000a      campaign designed to inform public policy (source 5).\u000a    The impact strategy of the Second Warwick Commission led by Seabrooke was\u000a      to target high-level international media outlets in order to stimulate\u000a      wider public debate about financial regulation as the crisis unfolded\u000a      (sources 6 and 7). A key recommendation of the Report&#8212;that an unlevel\u000a      playing field should be implemented through a combination of host country\u000a      regulation and macroprudential regulation based on types of risk rather\u000a      than the overall stores of safe capital&#8212; informed and shaped international\u000a      media responses. This included features in The Economist, Handelsblatt,\u000a      The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (source 7).\u000a      The elite of the world financial press reported on the Commission's\u000a      findings, including a feature article in The Economist comparing\u000a      the report with regulatory proposals from the Bank of England: \"Although\u000a      there is wide agreement that macroprudential policy is needed to limit\u000a      systemic risk, there has been very little detail about how it might work.\u000a      Two new reports help fill this gap. One is a discussion paper from the\u000a      Bank of England, which sketches out the elements of a macroprudential\u000a      regime and identifies what needs to be decided before it is put into\u000a      practice.

This research also informed media coverage of the\u000a      issue in The Guardian newspaper, The Swaziland Times and\u000a      formed the basis of his work with Traidcraft on their advocacy work around\u000a      Aid for Trade policy (source 9).\u000a    Informing practitioner agendas\u000a    Richardson's work informed and fed directly into an influential Report by\u000a      the Nuffield Council on Bioethics on biofuels, which called for mandatory\u000a      certification of all biofuel imports into the European Union (source 8).\u000a      This was later passed into legislation and Richardson is now working as an\u000a      academic consultant with Bonsucro, one of the world's biggest agricultural\u000a      certification schemes. Bonsucro is composed of companies and civil society\u000a      actors that collectively agree on a sustainability standard against which\u000a      members are audited. A testimonial obtained from the Head of\u000a      Sustainability, demonstrates that Richardson's work has fed directly into\u000a      the formulation and revision of Bonsucro's policy documentation (source\u000a      10). Among others, the Bonsucro standard has been adopted by the Brazilian\u000a      sugar industry and major downstream buyers like BP and Shell. Richardson\u000a      represented Bonsucro at the 2011 ISEAL Alliance conference and has also\u000a      been appointed to the five-person committee reviewing this standard, which\u000a      is due to deliver its findings by the end of 2013. The standard already\u000a      covers 2.5% of the global sugarcane area (over 500,000 hectares) and is\u000a      expanding quickly, providing an opportunity to improve the terms on which\u000a      workers, farmers and peasants engage with the industry.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Trade and finance are the lifeblood of the global economy.

The\u000a      underpinning research of this case study showcases work undertaken within\u000a      IPE at Warwick over the past two decades that has identified tensions\u000a      within and proposed practical initiatives to resolve such trade-offs. This\u000a      research has focused on both top-down approaches to international\u000a      regulatory regimes and bottom-up policy reforms driven through\u000a      private-sector governance initiatives, presenting the possibility of new\u000a      policy tools designed to produce more equitable outcomes in trade and\u000a      finance sectors when viewed globally.\u000a    To act as a bridge between academics, policy experts, and end-user\u000a      communities, PAIS staff pioneered the concept of the `Warwick Commission',\u000a      which has attracted substantial University funding since 2007. Warwick\u000a      Commissions are charged with carrying out independent analysis of a\u000a      seemingly intractable problem with the goal of making practical and\u000a      realistic recommendations for policy-makers: http:\/\/www2.warwick.ac.uk\/research\/warwickcommission\/.\u000a      The First Warwick Commission (2007-8), entitled `The Multilateral Trade\u000a      Regime: Which Way Forward?', took evidence from a wide range of experts\u000a      including politicians, trade practitioners, academics, key representative\u000a      business organisations and civil society actors with an interest in the\u000a      world trading system. The programme of research, directed by Professor\u000a      Higgott and assisted by an ESRC Impact Grant (RES-172-25-0055), lasted for\u000a      one year and led to a final Report, which was launched at the World Trade\u000a      Organization (WTO) in Geneva in December 2007. The Report argued that to\u000a      make the WTO `fit for purpose' key reforms should centre on redefining the\u000a      organisation's objectives and functions. In particular, these reforms\u000a      should aim to realign the WTO's responsibilities and governance procedures\u000a      in order to provide more equal benefits to its weaker member states.\u000a      Additionally, such reforms would enable the momentum behind the\u000a      proliferation of preferential trading agreements to be channelled towards\u000a      mutual policy goals that could benefit all countries, such as\u000a      non-discrimination between trading partners and greater transparency in\u000a      international commercial relationships.\u000a    The principal conclusions of the Second Warwick Commission (2009) on\u000a      `International Financial Reform' challenged conventional wisdom in\u000a      transnational policy communities and global governance scholarship that\u000a      effective international cooperation necessarily involves a transfer of\u000a      policy responsibilities from the national to regional or global levels.\u000a      This Report, directed by Professor Seabrooke, identified counter-cyclical\u000a      economic policies and macro-prudential regulatory frameworks as vital\u000a      tools to combat the sources of financial instability, the conflicts of\u000a      interest facing both private banking institutions and financial regulators\u000a      and the unsustainable asset bubbles that fuelled the conditions for the\u000a      various phases of the global financial crisis in 2007, 2008 and 2009. It\u000a      highlighted the problems associated with attempts to impose a\u000a      `one-size-fits-all' set of reforms to global financial governance that\u000a      would centralise responsibility for financial stability and regulation in\u000a      global institutions, which could magnify existing problems of `regulatory\u000a      capture'. Policy recommendations emphasised the importance of host country\u000a      regulation to govern both domestic and foreign banks operating in\u000a      particular jurisdictions.\u000a    Whereas the two Warwick Commissions focused on `high-level' engagement\u000a      with policy-makers connected to international institutions and national\u000a      governments, Dr Richardson has worked with practitioners to propose\u000a      changes in the way that transnational corporations treat their workers and\u000a      farmers. This is of particular importance given the expansion of sugar\u000a      production in the context of rising food prices and the use of sugar cane\u000a      to make biofuel. Richardson's research has addressed the use of non-state\u000a      governance initiatives, recommending that the `sustainable certification'\u000a      of sugar producers would be more effective if they were integrated with\u000a      existing regulatory authorities rather than duplicating tasks. It also\u000a      suggests that more emphasis is required on securing the livelihoods of the\u000a      rural poor, since the mechanisation of sugar production is leading to\u000a      large numbers of redundancies. Thus, the `Aid for Trade' initiatives\u000a      launched by international donors need to be used for social transfers as\u000a      well as promoting economic competitiveness.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1987","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Youngs' position as Director of FRIDE (rated as one of the `Top 30' think\u000a      tanks in Western Europe in the 2012 `Go To Think Tanks Survey') offers\u000a      excellent access to EU policy-makers, both as participants throughout the\u000a      research cycle and as beneficiaries of the main findings. This access\u000a      provides mechanisms for achieving a range of impacts beyond the\u000a      conventional model of producing and disseminating research reports.\u000a    The primary impact of the principal observations and recommendations\u000a      stemming from Youngs' underpinning research, particularly since the Arab\u000a      Spring, has been twofold:\u000a    \u000a      To inform political debate about incentivising democracy promotion in\u000a        the European Parliament (EP); to contribute to the revision of the\u000a        European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP); and to stimulate new EU initiatives\u000a        for democracy support.\u000a      To enhance the mainstreaming of human rights in EU foreign policy and\u000a        to establish new networks of stakeholders - including civil society\u000a        leaders - in policy deliberations.\u000a    \u000a    Collectively, these impacts have led to new thinking and defined best\u000a      practice (as laid out below) on more broad based political engagement, the\u000a      use of conditionality and holistic security approaches. The main\u000a      beneficiaries of the research since the Arab revolts began have been EU\u000a      elites and policy-makers, the European Parliament and the European\u000a      External Action Service (EEAS).\u000a    Informing political debate and shaping EU democracy support\u000a    The findings of Youngs' research on democracy promotion following the\u000a      Arab Spring have fed directly into policy debates in the EP. Through the\u000a      publication of policy recommendations as official EP documents, he has\u000a      informed and shaped formal parliamentary discussions (sources 1, 2 and 3).\u000a      One clear illustration of the concrete impact of this input is Youngs'\u000a      influence on the perspective of elites working in the EEAS.\u000a    The EEAS is the EU's diplomatic service, which, since the Lisbon Treaty\u000a      came into force on 1 December 2009, has been charged with running the EU's\u000a      relations with the rest of the world. Youngs has advised key EEAS\u000a      personnel on: EU policy approaches to supporting democracy promotion; the\u000a      timing, placement and content of public statements given by the High\u000a      Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\u000a      (Baroness Catherine Ashton); and on strategies for engaging with the\u000a      emerging political class across the Middle East. In particular, three\u000a      policy recommendations stemming from Youngs' underpinning research have\u000a      been taken up by the EEAS (sources 5, 6 and 7):\u000a    \u000a      The need for the EU to be more effective in engaging with Islamist\u000a        parties by down-playing issues of identity and culture;\u000a      The importance of the EU to avoid favouring particular candidates from\u000a        among communities of reformers;\u000a      The value of the EU switching from a `lecturing' to an\u000a        incentives-based discourse.\u000a    \u000a    In acknowledgement of the direct impact of Youngs' research on the work\u000a      of the EEAS, the EU Special Representative for the Southern Mediterranean,\u000a      states: \"My work representing the EU across North Africa and the Middle\u000a      East has benefited from the research undertaken by Professor Richard\u000a      Youngs and his team. This work has been particularly helpful in clarifying\u000a      the priorities for EU support to the Arab spring in light of the complex\u000a      nature of sequencing in democratic transitions. [...] We have learnt from\u000a      his work that sustainable reform requires broad-based coalitions, widely\u000a      accepted rules of the game, and flexibility in institutional models\"\u000a      (source 5). In her testimonial, the EEAS Policy Advisor from the\u000a      Directorate for Northern Africa, Middle East and Arabian Peninsula writes:\u000a      \"We have adopted a number of [Professor Youngs'] suggestions on how to\u000a      build cooperation with Islamists in low profile and context-specific ways\"\u000a      (source 6).\u000a    Youngs' research on political reform in the Arab world has also prompted\u000a      the EU Commission to consult FRIDE in their 2011 review of the EU\u000a      Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) (source 4). The ENP is the EU's main policy\u000a      framework for dealing with countries on its borders. Commitments to\u000a      democracy have by common consent not been highly effective. However, in\u000a      the light of input from outside experts including Youngs, the ENP has\u000a      since prioritised support for democracy and human rights. Specifically,\u000a      the Commission's review adopted Youngs' suggestions on how to reform the\u000a      ENP in order to support democracy promotion more effectively in line with\u000a      the three principles outlined above (source 4). The conclusions of his\u000a      `Demand-Driven Democracy' project were fed into EU policy documentation,\u000a      informed and shaped new strategies such as the International Institute for\u000a      Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA), which aims to\u000a      enhance responsiveness to local specificities (source 9). Furthermore, in\u000a      2009 Youngs provided text and intellectual input into the Founding Charter\u000a      of the European Partnership for Democracy (EPD), the first pan-European\u000a      body dedicated to democracy support and in more recent proposals for a new\u000a      European Endowment for Democracy (source 8). Since these developments,\u000a      more projects supporting democracy have begun, which has helped civic\u000a      organisations to survive, to share their experiences in building democracy\u000a      and to build capacity for such organisations to run democratic campaigns\u000a      (sources 8 and 10). The President of the Board of Directors of the EPD,\u000a      considers Youngs to be \"one of the leading academic experts on EU foreign\u000a      policy making\" and acknowledges his research as having helped EPD to\u000a      \"develop a distinctive European approach to democracy support, different\u000a      from that followed by the established American foundations working in this\u000a      area, based on inclusive multi-party dialogue\" (source 8).\u000a    Enhancing human rights in EU foreign policy\u000a    Another aspect of Youngs' impact is the major contribution of his\u000a      research to EU policy debate, formulation and implementation around issues\u000a      of human rights (sources 2 and 3). A 2011 Report commissioned by the\u000a      European Parliament included his recommendations for greater EU engagement\u000a      on the question of human rights in Gulf States. In March that year he was\u000a      invited to present evidence directly to the European Parliament\u000a      Sub-Committee on Human Rights as part of their session on `EU Human Rights\u000a      Policy on Events in the Arab World'. Research findings have been adopted\u000a      relating to the need to narrow the divide between Gulf and other Arab\u000a      states; the requirement for EU policy in the Gulf to `catch up' with other\u000a      strategic partners; and the importance of diversifying relations beyond\u000a      the ruling families of the region.

As Principal Investigator,\u000a      Youngs' work has addressed both dimensions via three packages of\u000a      underpinning research over a period of 5 years (2009-2013), which have\u000a      elucidated the views of actors including civil society activists, EU\u000a      policy-makers and the public.\u000a    The United Nations, the Arab Democracy Fund, the UK Department for\u000a      International Development and the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy\u000a      collectively funded Youngs' first package of underpinning research - a\u000a      major project entitled `Demand Driven Democracy Support (2009-2011). It\u000a      was commissioned because existing research had not adopted a fully\u000a      demand-driven approach to assessing democracy support. By contrast,\u000a      Youngs' programme of research canvassed the opinions of civil society\u000a      actors across 17 countries to find out what kind of support for political\u000a      reform they most seek. Focus group meetings with reformers deepened\u000a      understandings of their views on democratic models and external support\u000a      strategies and engaged them in iterative debate with those involved in\u000a      designing international democracy support initiatives.\u000a    The second package of Youngs' research, `Democracy after the Arab Spring'\u000a      (2009-2010), was funded from sources including the European Parliament.\u000a      Youngs convened a group of Islamist politicians from Morocco, Egypt,\u000a      Tunisia, Jordan and Palestine to discuss their expectations of EU policy.\u000a      He also oversaw fieldwork interviews with Islamist parties across nine\u000a      Middle Eastern states. Youngs consulted via interviews with hundreds of\u000a      Arab reformers to produce the first study of its kind. The research was\u000a      original in eliciting details on specifically what kind of support these\u000a      ascendant actors were seeking as the region began to change.\u000a    Thirdly, Youngs undertook three reports in 2010, 2011 and 2012\u000a      respectively, commissioned by the European Parliament on different aspects\u000a      of EU human rights and democracy policies, involving original research in\u000a      the context of the Arab states noted above and Russia. These reports\u000a      entailed underpinning empirical research that garnered opinions and\u000a      information from a wide range of parliamentarians. Youngs has also run a\u000a      series of roundtables with key policy-makers in Brussels (an average of\u000a      six per year since 2009 each involving up to 25 invitees) in order to\u000a      assess their deliberations and stimulate debate about new policy ideas in\u000a      EU democracy promotion.\u000a    The main findings from Youngs' extensive research across these three\u000a      packages between 2009 and 2013 have yielded a range of concrete\u000a      policy-relevant observations and recommendations that provide the\u000a      intellectual and practical basis of his impact activities:\u000a    \u000a      Local reformers prefer external support that is more tailored to their\u000a        specific context, more political, less divisive internally, more\u000a        flexible and agile, and more strongly supported by Western diplomacy;\u000a      The EU should support incipient political reform in the Arab world by\u000a        widening the circle of civil society interlocutors; including Islamists\u000a        in a subtle fashion in mainstream development initiatives; exerting\u000a        non-intrusive pressure through a nuanced use of positive conditionality;\u000a        bringing security and trade policies more systematically into line with\u000a        democracy policies; and relying less on exporting the EU's own rules and\u000a        norms;\u000a      The EU should multi-lateralise its democracy and human rights\u000a        policies, in a context in which such strategies are no longer solely a\u000a        matter for the transatlantic community.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1988","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Grant's research team worked closely with government bodies, the\u000d\u000a      biopesticides industry, growers and retailers and made recommendations for\u000d\u000a      new regulatory systems. The primary impact has been the facilitation and\u000d\u000a      implementation of a new regulatory framework for biopesticides in the UK\u000d\u000a      and Europe.

Grant's research studied this process of regulatory innovation and\u000d\u000a      worked closely with PSD to i) provide training to key members of PSD staff\u000d\u000a      to facilitate the achievement of their objectives and ii) enable the\u000d\u000a      development of a model that specified the conditions under which\u000d\u000a      regulatory innovation was likely to occur.\u000d\u000a    The project was characterised by effective engagement with a range of key\u000d\u000a      stakeholders. There were three principal beneficiaries of the research:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Regulators working in the PSD\/CRD (sources 5 and 7);\u000d\u000a      Decision-makers in the European Commission and the European Parliament\u000d\u000a        concerned with a revision of the relevant regulatory framework (source\u000d\u000a        6);\u000d\u000a      Manufacturers of biopesticides organised in the International\u000d\u000a        Biocontrol Manufacturers Association (IBMA) (source 8).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Grant and the team engaged in a continuous dialogue to co-produce\u000d\u000a      knowledge with the PSD regulators between 2004 and 2007, and organised\u000d\u000a      three training events at Warwick HRI and the PSD Head Quarters in York.\u000d\u000a      These knowledge transfer events used the results of the research to\u000d\u000a      improve the regulators' understanding of the underlying science and\u000d\u000a      principles of regulation (sources 5 and 7). Staff who attended these\u000d\u000a      events have confirmed the on-going impact of Grant's research since 2008\u000d\u000a      and in her testimony a source from the CRD writes: \"The series of training\u000d\u000a      events have had a long term impact in assisting technical evaluations by\u000d\u000a      better understanding the underlying science and biology related to some of\u000d\u000a      the potential biopesticide products\" (source 7). The events also\u000d\u000a      facilitated the development and subsequent implementation of a new\u000d\u000a      regulatory system more apposite to biopesticide usage (source 4).\u000d\u000a    Designing and implementing a regulatory system for biopesticide\u000d\u000a          usage in the UK\/EU\u000d\u000a    Regulation occurs at both a UK and EU level and the two systems are\u000d\u000a      intertwined. The regulators took up the findings and recommendations of\u000d\u000a      Grant's research and a new regulatory framework at the UK and EU level,\u000d\u000a      which took account of his work, ultimately came into force (sources 4, 5,\u000d\u000a      6 and 7). Grant was subsequently coopted as an Independent Advisor to the\u000d\u000a      Availability Action Plan Implementation Group of the National Pesticides\u000d\u000a      Strategy, which met until 2012 when it was dissolved and replaced by a\u000d\u000a      group with a narrower membership (source 4). As a direct result of his\u000d\u000a      research, the number of products registered for use in the UK has\u000d\u000a      increased, with 10 new biopesticide active substances registered since the\u000d\u000a      scheme started in 2007 (source 4 and 8). This compares with a low rate of\u000d\u000a      registration before then, for example 3 between 1985 and 1997. In turn,\u000d\u000a      this has broadened the range of options for farmers and heightened\u000d\u000a      environmental sustainability (source 4).\u000d\u000a    The research has had impact beyond the UK regulatory policy context and\u000d\u000a      has facilitated change at the EU level (sources 5 and 6). In 2008 Grant\u000d\u000a      was invited by the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture and Rural\u000d\u000a      Affairs to advise them on the future of crop protection policy in Europe.\u000d\u000a      His team also published a report, entitled `The Consequences of `Cut-Off'\u000d\u000a      Criteria for Biopesticides', for a committee of the European Parliament\u000d\u000a      and addressed questions by committee members in Brussels. Through\u000d\u000a      representation on the Steering Group of the European Commission policy\u000d\u000a      action REBECA, the project informed and influenced policy discussion and\u000d\u000a      decision-making across the EU (source 6). In 2009 the EU passed a new and\u000d\u000a      more effective package of legislation, which involved the substantial\u000d\u000a      revision of the existing directive and two new directives. The legislation\u000d\u000a      made specific provision for enhancing the use of biocontrol agents. This\u000d\u000a      led to a new zonal system of registration across member states, which had\u000d\u000a      been consistently advocated in Grant's research presentations to\u000d\u000a      policy-makers.\u000d\u000a    Mechanisms for achieving impact\u000d\u000a    A range of impact activities also engaged manufacturers of biopesticides\u000d\u000a      and brought them in closer conversation with the UK PSD and EU regulatory\u000d\u000a      bodies: two well-attended one-day conferences attracting 100 participants\u000d\u000a      from regulation and industry (sources 5 and 7); a series of workshops\u000d\u000a      organised across the EU as part of the REBECA project (source 6); and\u000d\u000a      presentations at the Annual Conference in 2009 and workshops of the IBMA,\u000d\u000a      for example at Grantham in 2010 (source 9). The IBMA had formerly been\u000d\u000a      afflicted by a lack of knowledge and understanding of the regulatory\u000d\u000a      context. Through these activities Grant provided necessary training. Based\u000d\u000a      on the findings of his research he was able to suggest new strategies and\u000d\u000a      tactics that could be used by the IBMA in making its case for greater\u000d\u000a      regulation to the EU and governments of Member States. This work\u000d\u000a      significantly enhanced the quality and effectiveness of the IBMA as a key\u000d\u000a      stakeholder (source 8).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Biopesticides can help protect crops and offer a more sustainable means\u000d\u000a      of pest protection to offset the withdrawal of synthetic products, as well\u000d\u000a      as offering the potential of a new hi-tech industry.

UK farmers and growers face the challenge of using\u000d\u000a      environmentally acceptable methods of crop protection while maintaining\u000d\u000a      food quality, productivity and profitability. One solution is to reduce\u000d\u000a      chemical inputs using Integrated Pest Management (IPM) based on biological\u000d\u000a      control agents such as naturally occurring fungi, bacteria, viruses or\u000d\u000a      nematodes. Historically, however, there has been a poor uptake of\u000d\u000a      microbial pesticides in the UK. Relatively few products have been\u000d\u000a      registered successfully and made commercially available.\u000d\u000a    The aim of Grant's research was to identify and overcome barriers to the\u000d\u000a      successful registration of biopesticides in the UK. He was Principal\u000d\u000a      Investigator of the project `Biological Alternatives to Chemical\u000d\u000a      Pesticides in the Food Chain'. This was part of the BBSRC's &#163;26.5M\u000d\u000a      research programme `Rural Economy and Land Use' (RELU) between 2004 and\u000d\u000a      2013, designed to change policies and practices concerning rural economy\u000d\u000a      and land use. Grant worked with Dr David Chandler and Dr Mark Tatchell\u000d\u000a      from Warwick Horticulture Research International (HRI). Also integral to\u000d\u000a      the project was Dr Justin Greaves from Politics and International Studies\u000d\u000a      who worked closely alongside Grant as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research carried out by Grant investigated the political\u000d\u000a      and intellectual limits of existing policy and regulatory frameworks in\u000d\u000a      the field of biopesticides. It identified and traced the evolution of a\u000d\u000a      model that did not allow for the successful registration of biopesticides\u000d\u000a      in the UK and EU contexts. A total of 49 interviews were conducted with\u000d\u000a      regulators, growers, consultants, manufacturers and retailers in order to\u000d\u000a      identify the obstacles to getting more products available on the market\u000d\u000a      more quickly. In addition, the team observed pre-registration meetings\u000d\u000a      held at the Pesticides Safety Directorate between potential registrants\u000d\u000a      and regulators so that they could identify the issues that concerned both\u000d\u000a      sides of the regulatory process.\u000d\u000a    The findings of the research highlighted shortcomings in the existing\u000d\u000a      regulatory system. Many of the difficulties that had arisen in registering\u000d\u000a      biopesticides arose from the design of the regulatory process to deal with\u000d\u000a      chemical pesticides. The project identified gaps in the incomplete and\u000d\u000a      under developed biopesticide policy network in terms of stakeholder\u000d\u000a      interaction and a need for a more structured dialogue between retailers\u000d\u000a      and the PSD - later known as the Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD).\u000d\u000a      The research showed that questions asked about chemical products were not\u000d\u000a      necessarily relevant to biological products and therefore the system had\u000d\u000a      an incomplete and inadequate regulatory design. The results of the\u000d\u000a      research provided the basis for a set of design principles that led to a\u000d\u000a      better regulatory system for biopesticides.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1992","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"},{"GeoNamesId":"203312","Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Institutional capacity development: providing resources for\u000d\u000a      practitioners\u000d\u000a    Scholte's engagements with GGI and CSO practitioners have helped raise\u000d\u000a      the quantity and quality of their interactions. A concrete example relates\u000d\u000a      to the IMF, where in 2003 Scholte drafted the institution's `Staff Guide\u000d\u000a      for Relations with Civil Society Organizations', described by the Managing\u000d\u000a      Director as \"a framework for IMF staff to understand and contribute to the\u000d\u000a      expanding dialogue and therefore make it more productive\" (source 1).\u000d\u000a      Specifically mandated by the IMF Executive Board, the guide was circulated\u000d\u000a      to all staff. The IMF also routinely distributes the guide to its CSO\u000d\u000a      interlocutors. A testimonial from the Director of External Relations at\u000d\u000a      the IMF can corroborate Scholte's on-going impact (source 8). He is\u000d\u000a      currently advising the IMF on the guide's revision, and presented\u000d\u000a      suggested amendments in view of lessons learned from his underpinning\u000d\u000a      research at the institution's annual meeting in Tokyo in 2012. There he\u000d\u000a      convened a workshop with CSOs and IMF\/World Bank officials to discuss\u000d\u000a      possible policy revisions, and wrote an informal report afterwards for IMF\u000d\u000a      civil society liaison officers (source 8).\u000d\u000a    In 2008-9 Scholte provided more specific advice to the IMF African\u000d\u000a      Department, consisting of 6 country reports based on fresh fieldwork, an\u000d\u000a      internally circulated paper `IMF Relations with Civil Society in Africa:\u000d\u000a      \"Quick-Win\" Steps to Improved Engagement', and a seminar at IMF\u000d\u000a      headquarters for leads of African country teams. As a direct result of\u000d\u000a      Scholte's country visits, IMF representatives in Congo, Malawi, Mozambique\u000d\u000a      and Nigeria upgraded their relations with CSOs. At headquarters, the\u000d\u000a      African Department designated a senior official for outreach and created\u000d\u000a      an Africa Regional Advisory Group including several CSO members. In 2009\u000d\u000a      the Independent Evaluation Office of the IMF commissioned Scholte to\u000d\u000a      undertake a comprehensive review of IMF-CSO relations (source 2). His\u000d\u000a      resulting report has encouraged IMF initiatives such as a substantial (and\u000d\u000a      very well received) programme to sponsor CSOs from poor countries to\u000d\u000a      attend the institution's Annual and Spring Meetings, as well as plans to\u000d\u000a      develop staff training on relations with CSOs (source 2).\u000d\u000a    Scholte has also given advice on upgrading relations with CSOs to the\u000d\u000a      Commonwealth (public seminar, 2011), ICANN (advice to its Vice President,\u000d\u000a      2011), UN Secretariat (public seminar, 2008), World Bank (staff seminars,\u000d\u000a      2008, 2011) and WTO (staff seminar, 2011) (sources 3 and 7). In 2011 he\u000d\u000a      prepared the background paper on civil society and governance for a future\u000d\u000a      Global Fund for Young Children that the World Bank is currently exploring\u000d\u000a      together with leading international child welfare foundations. In\u000d\u000a      addition, Scholte has provided inputs on CSO relations to the European\u000d\u000a      Commission (presentation of research results, 2010), the Haidian District\u000d\u000a      People's Political Consultative Committee, Beijing (two-hour meeting with\u000d\u000a      its leadership, 2008), the Mexico City Government (staff training seminar,\u000d\u000a      2012), the Netherlands Government Commission on Modernising Diplomacy\u000d\u000a      (two-hour testimony, 2012) and the UK Foreign Office (audience with\u000d\u000a      Foreign Secretary David Miliband 2008, Wilton Park briefing 2011).\u000d\u000a    Workshops of the Ford Foundation funded Building Global Democracy (BGD)\u000d\u000a      programme coordinated by Scholte between 2007 and 12 have involved several\u000d\u000a      dozen CSOs together with officials from the Arab League, Commonwealth,\u000d\u000a      FAO, Global Fund, ICANN, OECD, IMF, UNECA, UNESCO, UNICEF, UN NGLS,\u000d\u000a      UNRCPD, the World Bank and WTO. At these workshops GGI officials and CSO\u000d\u000a      actors from around the world become acquainted, learn from each other, and\u000d\u000a      deepen trust that promotes substantive exchanges over policy and projects\u000d\u000a      (source 6). Feedback from participants shows that they consider these\u000d\u000a      events to have been informative, stimulating new ideas and leading to new\u000d\u000a      connections between organisations. BGD has also produced practitioner-\u000d\u000a      oriented booklets and toolkits to advance CSO inclusion in global\u000d\u000a      governance (sources 4 and 5). Over 3,000 hard copies of the toolkits have\u000d\u000a      circulated (including in training seminars) and hundreds more\u000d\u000a      practitioners have accessed online versions on the BGD website (source 9).\u000d\u000a    Scholte has also advised the following foundations on their programmes\u000d\u000a      concerning civil society and global governance (sources 4, 5 and 6): the\u000d\u000a      Carnegie UK Trust (2008, 2012-13), Dag Hammarskj&#246;ld Foundation (2009),\u000d\u000a      Ford Foundation (2009), and Joseph Rowntree Foundation (2010). Foundation\u000d\u000a      support to NGOs is vital in sustaining CSO engagement of global\u000d\u000a      governance. Scholte also advises the One World Trust on its widely\u000d\u000a      consulted Global Accountability Project (since 2004) and CIVICUS on its\u000d\u000a      Global Civil Society Report (since 2011).\u000d\u000a    Scholte has contributed dozens of capacity-building sessions on GGI\u000d\u000a      engagement with CSOs as varied as the Tomorrow Project, London (2008), the\u000d\u000a      Congolese Coalition on External Debt, Kinshasa (2009), the Global Policy\u000d\u000a      Forum, Bonn (2010), the International Institute for Sustainable\u000d\u000a      Development, Geneva (2011), the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary\u000d\u000a      Action, Belfast (2012) and Eurodad (2013). CSOs also continually seek\u000d\u000a      Scholte's ad hoc advice on when, where and through whom they can best\u000d\u000a      access global governance (sources 4, 5 and 6). He also constantly connects\u000d\u000a      relevant persons across these circles to further GGI-CSO relations (e.g.\u000d\u000a      when CSOs in 2012 launched a global network on IMF advocacy).\u000d\u000a    Enhancing public awareness of global governance issues and informing\u000d\u000a        debate\u000d\u000a    Scholte's research-based public engagement work has widely raised\u000d\u000a      awareness of the possibilities of citizen engagement of global governance,\u000d\u000a      in order to promote the benefits identified in Section 2 above. His 51\u000d\u000a      presentations to audiences including policy-makers, NGOs, trade unions,\u000d\u000a      social movements, think tanks, faith-based groups, journalists and the\u000d\u000a      general public in 23 countries during the REF reporting period reached\u000d\u000a      over 2,000 people.

The BGD quarterly newsletter with regular items on\u000d\u000a      GGI- CSO relations circulated to 6,600 recipients in 162 countries. The\u000d\u000a      BGD website attracted over 60,000 visits since its 2009 launch, from an\u000d\u000a      average of 114 countries per month in 2012.

Scholte has also shaped media\u000d\u000a      coverage of civil society in global politics via outlets such as the BBC\u000d\u000a      World Service (2010) and Financial Times (2011).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Global rules and regulatory institutions have major and ever-growing\u000d\u000a      importance in contemporary governance.

Relevant projects include `Global Economic Institutions and\u000d\u000a      Global Social Movements' (1996-9), `Civil Society and Global Finance'\u000d\u000a      (1999-2002), `Civil Society and Democracy in Global Economic Governance'\u000d\u000a      (2001-5), `Civil Society and Accountable Global Governance' (2006-10),\u000d\u000a      `Civil Society and the International Monetary Fund: Progress towards\u000d\u000a      Global Accountability?' (2007-9), `Building Global Democracy' (2008-12)\u000d\u000a      and `Explorations in Global Democracy' (2012-13). Scholte has been sole\u000d\u000a      Principal Investigator (PI) in the last five projects and joint PI in the\u000d\u000a      first two. The 6 outputs listed in Section 3 are a selection of the 7\u000d\u000a      books, 14 articles, 22 book chapters and 8 policy reports that Scholte has\u000d\u000a      written on the subject since 1998.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research has involved extensive fieldwork, including\u000d\u000a      Scholte's personal interviews with over 900 officials and activists in 34\u000d\u000a      countries on 6 continents. The main GGIs addressed include the IMF, the\u000d\u000a      World Bank and the World Trade Organisation (WTO), with secondary\u000d\u000a      attention to the Commonwealth, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names\u000d\u000a      and Numbers (ICANN) and several United Nations (UN) agencies. The hundreds\u000d\u000a      of participating CSOs range from well-known bodies such as Oxfam to highly\u000d\u000a      marginalised constituencies such as indigenous peoples associations in\u000d\u000a      Amazonia.\u000d\u000a    One important result of this research has been to identify where civil\u000d\u000a      society is and is not engaged with global governance. Comparatively, some\u000d\u000a      CSOs and some GGIs pursue more mutual connections than others. The\u000d\u000a      research has ascribed these differences in levels of interaction to\u000d\u000a      several conditions of the actors involved, including competences,\u000d\u000a      resources, incentives, policymaking procedures and institutional cultures.\u000d\u000a      In addition, a heritage of state-centric world order has often militated\u000d\u000a      against greater GGI-CSO relations, while other deeper structural forces\u000d\u000a      related to capitalist production and modern-rationalist knowledge have\u000d\u000a      shaped the relative levels of access to global governance for different\u000d\u000a      kinds of CSOs.\u000d\u000a    Scholte's research has also demonstrated significant benefits from civil\u000d\u000a      society to global governance, so that increases in the quantity and\u000d\u000a      quality of GGI-CSO interchanges are worth pursuing. In particular, the\u000d\u000a      findings of his research suggest that CSOs can: (a) contribute information\u000d\u000a      and advice not available from official sources; (b) raise important\u000d\u000a      alternative issues and perspectives; (c) cultivate sensitivity to context\u000d\u000a      and suitable policy adaptations in this regard; (d) sharpen policy\u000d\u000a      analysis with challenges and debate; (e) provide pressure for the adoption\u000d\u000a      and implementation of needed policies; and (f) bolster the accountability\u000d\u000a      and legitimacy of global governance. To help realise such potential,\u000d\u000a      Scholte's research has diagnosed various aspects of process that affect\u000d\u000a      the quality of GGI-CSO interaction. The preparation, execution and\u000d\u000a      follow-up of dialogue have often been wanting. Shortcomings related to\u000d\u000a      timing, participation, substance and style of interchanges frequently\u000d\u000a      detract from their outcomes. More recently, Scholte's findings have\u000d\u000a      highlighted issues of accountability in GGI-CSO relations. A study he\u000d\u000a      coordinated of 13 global governance mechanisms showed that CSOs can\u000d\u000a      significantly increase transparency, consultation, monitoring and redress\u000d\u000a      in respect of GGIs. However, much more could be achieved and the research\u000d\u000a      has elaborated suggestions for improvement in respect of personal\u000d\u000a      qualities, institutional conditions and deeper structures of world order.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3000","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aA comprehensive Impact strategy was built into the FoES project from the outset. IPPR's\u000d\u000ainvolvement in the project was central to implementation of this strategy: IPPR helped ensure\u000d\u000apublicity for the findings of the successive waves of research, and also brokered discussions with\u000d\u000asenior Labour party figures. The strategy has enabled the research to have three substantial non-academic\u000d\u000aimpacts.\u000d\u000aFirst, the research stimulated widespread public debate on the status of England within the United\u000d\u000aKingdom. Publication of the two FoES reports (in January 20123.5 and July 20133.6) prompted\u000d\u000awidespread media comment and debate, including:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aWell over 100 newspaper reports on the findings (including stories in all the main London\u000d\u000aquality newspapers), and Leader articles in many London and Scottish-based newspapers;\u000d\u000aFeatures on major broadcast news shows (including Radio 4's Today programme) and on\u000d\u000athe BBC News website.5.1\u000a\u000d\u000aOp-ed pieces written by research team members around publication of the FoES II report,\u000d\u000apublished in the Daily Telegraph, Scotsman, Western Mail, and on the Conservative Home\u000d\u000aand New Statesman blogs;\u000d\u000aAnalysis by leading political commentators (including Bagehot in The Economist5.2, Andrew\u000d\u000aRawnsley in The Observer5.3, Jackie Ashley and Martin Kettle in The Guardian, Philip\u000d\u000aJohnston in the Daily Telegraph, Dominic Sandbrook in the Daily Mail, and Brian Taylor of\u000d\u000aBBC Scotland) of the implications of the research for England's status within the UK and\/or\u000d\u000athe potentially destabilising effects for Britain of English dissatisfaction with current\u000d\u000agoverning arrangements.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThe wider influence of FoES on political debate is shown by, inter alia, references to the research\u000d\u000amade in Alex Salmond's January 2012 Hugo Young Lecture; references in the November 2012\u000d\u000areport of the Commission on Improving Devolution in Wales; numerous discussions of the research\u000d\u000aon highly influential blogs (see examples in section 5)5.4, 5.5; and the invitation extended to the\u000d\u000aresearch team to present findings at the 2013 Hay Literary Festival.\u000d\u000aSecond, the research directly influenced the Final Report of the McKay Commission5.6 (the\u000d\u000aCommission on the Consequences of Devolution for the House of Commons) to which Jeffery was\u000d\u000aappointed in recognition of his expertise on Englishness. Wyn Jones presented FoES I findings to\u000d\u000aan inaugural private meeting of the Commission, and FoES II included several questions requested\u000d\u000aby the Commission. The Commission used (then unpublished) FoES II findings in its March 2013\u000d\u000aFinal Report, citing FoES heavily (see McKay 2013: pp14-205.6) as providing \"compelling evidence\u000d\u000athat there are distinct concerns, felt across England, that lack sufficient opportunity to be\u000d\u000aexpressed through current institutional arrangements\" (p.21). This understanding of public\u000d\u000aattitudes, in turn, underpinned the Commission's central recommendation that \"decisions at the\u000d\u000aUnited Kingdom level with a separate and distinct effect for England...should normally be taken\u000d\u000aonly with the consent of a majority of MPs for constituencies in England\" (pp.8-9). The direct\u000d\u000ainfluence of FoES II has been acknowledged by the Commission chair, William McKay:5.7 \"[I]t was\u000d\u000aessential to understand how the electorate in England viewed present arrangements, and what if\u000d\u000aany adjustments they considered necessary... These demands were fully met by the FoES\u000d\u000a2012...The FoES was in short an essential, clear and helpful foundation for the Commission's\u000d\u000aunderstanding of the contents and direction of the `English Question' in spring of 2013. On that\u000d\u000abasis the Commission was enabled to make proposals for a solution to the West Lothian\u000d\u000aQuestion.\"\u000d\u000aThird, the most prominent FoES finding &#8212; of an increasingly distinct English identity and growing\u000d\u000ademand for institutional recognition of that identity &#8212; has influenced the Labour Party's\u000d\u000aconstitutional thinking5.8, 5.9,5.10. Several left-leaning blogs immediately responded to the first FoES\u000d\u000areport by arguing for a new Labour approach towards England. That challenge was taken up by\u000d\u000asenior Labour figures, including John Denham, Private Secretary to Labour Leader Ed Miliband.\u000d\u000aDenham blogged on the IPPR website in late-January 2012 about the need for Labour to develop a\u000d\u000apositive `case for a progressive England'. Denham referred directly to the FoES' finding of\u000d\u000aresentment among the English: that they \"feel like they are losing out and being treated less fairly\u000d\u000athan the others\" (Denham 20125.8). Denham advocated a response based in the revitalisation of\u000d\u000aEnglish local government rather than special procedures for English laws at Westminster. These\u000d\u000athoughts were expanded upon in a major speech by Ed Miliband in June 20125.9 in which Miliband\u000d\u000aargued that \"the best reflection of devolution to Scotland and Wales in England lies in taking power\u000d\u000aout of Whitehall and devolving it down to local authorities\"; Miliband's Senior Advisor, Lord Wood,\u000d\u000ahas confirmed that \"[t]he report on English attitudes was studied by Ed's advisers, and helped\u000d\u000ainform the speech he gave at the Royal Festival Hall last year.

Coordinated through the European Science Foundation and funded by national funders in\u000d\u000afive states, CANS fielded a survey that explored the relationship between territorial community,\u000d\u000apolitical participation and social citizenship in fourteen sub-state jurisdictions in spring 2009.\u000d\u000aProfessor Wincott (Co-Chair of the Wales Governance Centre, 2008 - current) and Wyn Jones\u000d\u000awere both centrally involved at all stages of the CANS project: conceptualisation, questionnaire\u000d\u000adesign, analysis and dissemination (Henderson et al 2013a;3.3 2013b;3.4 Jeffery and Wincott 2010).\u000d\u000aIn early 2011, Cardiff and Edinburgh Universities agreed a collaboration with IPPR to conduct a\u000d\u000avariant of the CANS survey in England. The `Future of England Survey' (FoES) was conducted by\u000d\u000aYouGov in July 2011, with a report based on the key findings published in January 2012.3.5 As an\u000d\u000aunintended consequence of devolution, England was increasingly becoming a delineated political\u000d\u000aunit in its own right. Plentiful anecdotal evidence suggested that identity patterns in England were\u000d\u000achanging; FoES was designed to provide systematic evidence about the extent to which people\u000d\u000aidentified as English, defined England as their political community, and sought England-specific\u000d\u000ainstitutional arrangements to reflect this sense of community. A second wave (FoES II) was\u000d\u000aconducted in autumn 2012, with the report published in July 20133.6: to test the robustness of the\u000d\u000aoriginal findings, provide more detailed evidence on ethnic minorities in England, and explore the\u000d\u000arelationship between attitudes to England's `two unions' &#8212; the UK and EU. Wincott and Wyn Jones\u000d\u000awere again centrally involved in both waves of the research; Scully joined the project team for\u000d\u000aFoES II.\u000d\u000aThe main findings of the FoES surveys have been:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aWhile dual Anglo-British national identities persist, there appears to be increasingly\u000d\u000aemphasis on the English aspect;\u000d\u000aThere are few regional or socio-economic distinctions in attitudes, with the significant\u000d\u000aexception of ethnicity: ethnic minority respondents are substantially more likely to stress a\u000d\u000aBritish identity;\u000d\u000aThere is substantial and growing support for England to be explicitly recognised in the\u000d\u000agoverning structures of the UK. This sentiment has not crystallised behind a specific\u000d\u000aconstitutional form, but encompasses support for England to be dealt with as a distinct unit\u000d\u000a(there is little support for English regionalism) and substantially declining support for the\u000d\u000aterritorial status quo. There is also strong evidence of increasing `devo-anxiety': resentment\u000d\u000aat the privileged position devolution is perceived to have granted Scotland within the UK;\u000d\u000aThe greater an individual's sense of English identity, the more likely they are to support an\u000d\u000aEnglish dimension (whether an English parliament or some version of English votes for\u000d\u000aEnglish laws at Westminster);\u000d\u000aNational identity and devo-anxiety are both strongly related to attitudes towards England's\u000d\u000a`other Union', the EU. Those with a stronger English identity are also more likely to adopt a\u000d\u000ahostile attitude towards UK membership of the EU; perhaps counter-intuitively, a more\u000d\u000aBritish national identity is associated with more positive EU attitudes.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"3001","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Cardiff research on public attitudes in Wales has had four substantial\u000d\u000a      impacts.\u000d\u000a    First, by directly informing both the conclusions of the All Wales\u000d\u000a      Convention, and the behaviour of key actors in the 2011 Welsh devolution\u000d\u000a      referendum, the research has significantly influenced the Welsh devolution\u000d\u000a      settlement. The All Wales Convention was established by the Welsh\u000d\u000a      Government in 2008 to make recommendations regarding a referendum on\u000d\u000a      moving to Part 4 of the 2006 Government of Wales Act (i.e. granting the\u000d\u000a      Welsh Assembly primary law-making powers). The impact of the research\u000d\u000a      occurred at several points in the Convention's work:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Key research findings, detailing changes in public attitudes since the\u000d\u000a        1990s, were presented to the Convention early in its work (in 2009).\u000d\u000a        This provided the Convention with a baseline understanding of attitudes\u000d\u000a        to devolution in Wales.\u000d\u000a      Wyn Jones acted as a consultant to the Convention, providing detailed\u000d\u000a        guidance on the content of further public attitudes research (two\u000d\u000a        surveys and several focus groups) commissioned by the Convention from\u000d\u000a        GfKNOP;\u000d\u000a      Wyn Jones provided advice to the Convention Chair, at the latter's\u000d\u000a        request, when he was drafting its Final Report.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The Convention's November 2009 final report5.1 observed\u000d\u000a      \"substantial support for devolution as it stands, and clear signs of an\u000d\u000a      appetite for more\" (p.98), and supported holding a referendum. The\u000d\u000a      Convention Chair, Sir Emyr Jones Parry has stated that \"Certainly the\u000d\u000a      conclusions of the All Wales Convention drew on results produced by\u000d\u000a      Professor Wyn Jones. The clear view that a referendum was winnable led\u000d\u000a      directly to the recommendation to hold one... The referendum result bore\u000d\u000a      this out and endorsed the conclusions advocated earlier by Professor Wyn\u000d\u000a      Jones.\" 5.2\u000d\u000a    The research also then directly informed the decision of the Welsh\u000d\u000a      Government to proceed towards holding the referendum. As the then Deputy\u000d\u000a      First Minister has confirmed, \"It was necessary for the two parties within\u000d\u000a      the coalition to be satisfied that the state of public opinion in Wales\u000d\u000a      was sufficiently strong in favour of law making powers to enable us to\u000d\u000a      trigger the provisions of the GOWA 2006. The evidence provided by the\u000d\u000a      Governance Centre was clear, in that the support for further devolution\u000d\u000a      had grown substantially since the Assembly was established in 1999, and\u000d\u000a      that a clear majority for a Yes vote was likely if a referendum were to be\u000d\u000a      held. Evidence of this kind, supported by the evidence obtained by the all\u000d\u000a      party Convention encouraged the coalition parties to hold a referendum in\u000d\u000a      March 2011. The result, with 63.5% voting Yes, confirmed that the evidence\u000d\u000a      we relied on was correct\".5.3 The research also provided the\u000d\u000a      central evidence base for the campaign strategy of the successful Yes\u000d\u000a      campaign team in the 2011 referendum: as the Chair of the steering\u000d\u000a      committee for the Yes for Wales campaign group has confirmed, \"I can vouch\u000d\u000a      for the extent to which this evidence played directly into our campaign\u000d\u000a      planning\";5.4 the Yes Campaign Director observes: \"Having\u000d\u000a      played a key role in the two Welsh devolution campaigns, as National\u000d\u000a      Organiser in 1997 and Campaign Director in 2011, I can directly compare\u000d\u000a      experiences of the volume of information and understanding of political\u000d\u000a      trend apparent in both. A key difference was the greater breadth of\u000d\u000a      publicly available data and understanding available to both sides in the\u000d\u000a      2011 campaign compared to 1997, and this key difference was directly\u000d\u000a      related to the high value and unique work undertaken by Dr Richard Wyn\u000d\u000a      Jones and Dr Roger Scully.\" The Yes victory in the March 2011 referendum\u000d\u000a      substantially enhanced the Assembly's powers, significantly changing\u000d\u000a      Wales' devolution settlement.\u000d\u000a    Second, the research has already influenced the on-going work of the Silk\u000d\u000a      Commission, established in 2011 by the UK government to review Welsh\u000d\u000a      devolution. Research findings (concerning public attitudes towards\u000d\u000a      devolution of taxation) were presented in early 2012 to the Commission. By\u000d\u000a      clarifying for the Commission what was known, and what unknown, about\u000d\u000a      relevant public attitudes, this work shaped subsequent social research\u000d\u000a      conducted by the Commission, and it is cited in Chapter 8 of the Silk\u000d\u000a      Commission's first report (published November 2012)5.5, which\u000d\u000a      recommended devolving substantial taxation powers to the Welsh Assembly.\u000d\u000a      Broader findings - concerning public support for devolution more generally\u000d\u000a      - were extensively cited and quoted in Welsh Government evidence submitted\u000d\u000a      to the Commission in February 20135.6 (see pp.4-5); the then\u000d\u000a      Minister for Education and Skills has confirmed that the Welsh Government\u000d\u000a      \"cited this evidence as underpinning the case for reform\" in developing\u000d\u000a      the Government's argument for both an extension in both the scope of\u000d\u000a      devolution and a fundamental change in its form (from a `conferred' to a\u000d\u000a      `reserved' powers model).5.4\u000d\u000a    Third, the research has contributed substantially towards informing\u000d\u000a      political debate in Wales. The research team has actively disseminated\u000d\u000a      major findings via:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      A series of public seminars in Cardiff (June 2009, October 2009, May\u000d\u000a        2010, June 2011, October 2011, May 2012); these have attracted\u000d\u000a        substantial audiences, including AMs, journalists, and representatives\u000d\u000a        of major civil society organisations;\u000d\u000a      Other public seminars, at the Institute of Government in London\u000d\u000a        (December 2011) and Aberystwyth (June 2010, June 2011, October 2011),\u000d\u000a        which also attracted substantial (i.e. c.30-60) non-academic audiences.\u000d\u000a      Numerous broadcast media appearances by research team members (across\u000d\u000a        BBC-Wales, ITV-Wales and S4C television; Radio 4, Radio 5Live, Radio\u000d\u000a        Wales and Radio Cymru).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    These activities have directly informed political and social elites about\u000d\u000a      evidence on public attitudes. They have also contributed to public debate\u000d\u000a      more widely: by informing key political journalists, and through extensive\u000d\u000a      media reporting and discussion of the findings.5.7 \"In the\u000d\u000a      run-up to the 2011 devolution referendum in Wales [the research] was\u000d\u000a      absolutely crucial in informing the understanding of public attitudes\"\u000d\u000a      according to the Chief Reporter of the Western Mail, who has\u000d\u000a      further observed of Scully and Wyn Jones that \"Their research has been\u000d\u000a      indispensable, enriching understanding of the public's growing acceptance\u000d\u000a      of the National Assembly as an institution and of its appetite for more\u000d\u000a      powers\".5.8\u000d\u000a    Fourth, the research has facilitated the enhancement of social survey\u000d\u000a      capacity in Wales, and thereby also led directly to the more regular\u000d\u000a      conducting of political polling in Wales. Scully and Wyn Jones worked\u000d\u000a      closely with the survey agency YouGov5.9 to help YouGov\u000d\u000a      establish and demonstrate a Wales-specific survey capacity. The content of\u000d\u000a      YouGov's first ever public survey in Wales (summer 2009) was designed by\u000d\u000a      Scully and Wyn Jones, drawing heavily on their previous work. Survey\u000d\u000a      findings were then disseminated at a widely-attended Cardiff public\u000d\u000a      seminar. This seminar led directly to ITV-Wales commissioning YouGov to\u000d\u000a      conduct regular polling through May 2011's Welsh Assembly election;\u000d\u000a      somewhat more infrequent polling has continued subsequently.\u000d\u000a    As YouGov's Research Manager responsible for Wales has confirmed, the\u000d\u000a      input of Scully and Wyn Jones was \"integral in allowing YouGov to expand\u000d\u000a      our operations in Wales. Their input helped us to design our sampling and\u000d\u000a      weighting schemes when we decided to make a concerted effort to start\u000d\u000a      regular polling in Wales. Following this work, YouGov has had considerable\u000d\u000a      success accurately predicting vote share in the 2010 General Election and\u000d\u000a      2011 Welsh Assembly Elections and well as the 2011 Welsh referendum.

As part of that school, Rodin's research and\u000a      his direct involvement in military teaching and policy consultation have\u000a      affected the training of military officers and senior civil servants\u000a      across the US, UK and beyond and begun to inform changes in military\u000a      doctrine.\u000a    (1) Changing military thinking and training regarding the ethics of\u000a          war\u000a    Rodin's contributions to revisionist Just War Theory have been\u000a      incorporated into the teaching of military ethics at military academies\u000a      throughout the world. `War and Self-Defense' [R1], and\u000a      other works by Rodin are being used in military ethics courses at West\u000a      Point (the United States Military Academy), the US Naval Postgraduate\u000a      School, the UK Defence Academy, and the Australian Defence Academy.\u000a      Students at these academies range from cadets to elite officers and future\u000a      military leaders. For example:\u000a    (a) United States: Military Academy staff at West Point\u000a      report that their thinking about military ethics has shifted substantially\u000a      and attribute significant credit for this shift to Rodin's research as\u000a      part of the revisionist school [R1, R2, R4]. West Point now places\u000a      greater importance on human rights as the foundation for both the theory\u000a      and the legitimization of the use of force in military operations. West\u000a      Point staff confirm the influence of Rodin's research on faculty, the\u000a      curriculum and courses in ethics and Just War Theory [C1].\u000a      At West Point alone, the training of 6,000 American Army Officers over the\u000a      last five years has included Rodin's ideas and reconceptualization of Just\u000a        War Theory, changing fundamentally the teaching on the morality of\u000a      killing in war [C1]. Rodin's research has had similar impact on\u000a      military ethics courses taught by the US Naval Postgraduate School to\u000a      officers across all branches of the US military - Army, Navy, Air Force\u000a      and Marines - as well as officers from militaries the world over. [R1,\u000a        R4, R5, C2].\u000a    (b) United Kingdom: As a result of his work on the ethics\u000a      of war, Rodin was invited by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) to contribute\u000a      to the teaching of ethics at the UK Defence Academy. Since 2002, Rodin has\u000a      taught on the ethics component of broader courses at the Academy,\u000a      introducing insights from his research into each. The element on ethics is\u000a      considered vital to the broader learning and understanding needed by\u000a      operational commanders. He has taught on the:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aAdvanced Command Staff Course, which serves an international\u000a        cohort of approximately 300 mid-career officers a year (2002-present);\u000a      \u000aHigher Command and Staff Course, a selective course aimed at\u000a        Colonels and attended by around 25 (2-3%) of officers each year\u000a        (2004-2006, since 2006 the HCSC cohort are included within the\u000a        Defence Strategic Leadership Programme ethics component) [C3].\u000a      \u000aDefence Strategic Leadership Programme (DSLP), which is\u000a        mandatory for all military officers promoted to 1 star rank (Brigadier)\u000a        (2004-present);\u000a      \u000aCollaborative Strategic Leadership Programme (CSLP) - similar\u000a        to the DSLP for equivalent rank personnel from the Foreign Office, MOD\u000a        and other government departments, serving around 85 officers and civil\u000a        servants a year (2010 and 2011).\u000a    \u000a    Rodin's research on the ethics of war has informed his design and\u000a      teaching of ethics modules [C3]. His work [R1, R4 and other\u000a        publications] is included in Defence Academy (Joint Services Command\u000a      &amp; Staff College) reading lists for Military Ethics and Just War.\u000a      Between 2008 and 2013 Rodin's research has made a contribution to the way\u000a      some 2,000 senior military officers and civil servants understand moral\u000a      choices in war.\u000a    (2) Contributing to changes in military doctrine and practice\u000a      Rodin's research has also contributed to changes in military doctrine and\u000a      practice:\u000a    (a) United States: As a result of his work on morality in\u000a      war, Rodin participated in the inaugural conference for a major review of\u000a      the US Army's Professional Military Ethic, and was invited in 2009 to act\u000a      as a consultant to General Dempsey the then Commanding General for the US\u000a      Army's Training and Doctrine Command to assist in the preparation of a US\u000a      Army White Paper. Rodin facilitated a meeting for the core West Point\u000a      drafting team at the Oxford Institute for Ethics Law and Armed Conflict\u000a      (Summer 2010) at which a number of invited UK academics examined the\u000a      emerging text in detail. Rodin's research and influence are described as\u000a      \"decisive\" [C4] in including an explicit statement in the White\u000a      Paper that the ethic of the US Army must derive from human rights and that\u000a      the US Army's actions and policies are subject to this moral construct.\u000a      This statement represents a significant change in the US Army's approach\u000a      to ethics [C4]. The resulting White Paper, The Profession of\u000a        Arms, was published by General Dempsey (by then promoted to 37th\u000a      Chief of Staff) in December 2010. The Paper cites Rodin's article Justifying\u000a        Harm [R6] in the section on the principles that govern the\u000a      use of force (p.14) [C5].\u000a    The White Paper is described as the key document in the process that led\u000a      to a new Army Doctrine Publication (ADP 1), the capstone mandatory\u000a      training manual in the US doctrinal system [C4]. The White Paper\u000a      also served as a foundational document for a year-long US Army initiative\u000a      on The Profession of Arms in 2012, which included a series of\u000a      workshops with senior staff specifically on the impact of a Human Rights\u000a      based ethic on US Army operations, including one with a Brigade Combat\u000a      Team recently returned from Afghanistan [C4].\u000a    (b) United Kingdom: Rodin's contributions to revisionist Just\u000a        War Theory have also shaped the approach of the British Armed\u000a      Forces. In 2010 and 2011, the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed\u000a      Conflict (under the joint leadership of Rodin and others) partnered with\u000a      the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the International Law Department of the\u000a      British Red Cross to host two conferences on Military Ethics for the UK\u000a      defence community. The purpose of these meetings was to bring together\u000a      senior leaders in the MOD and other government departments with academics\u000a      to raise awareness of the challenges of ethically-aware decision-making at\u000a      operational and strategic levels, and to establish the need for new or\u000a      revised military doctrine. Reports from the event acknowledge the growing\u000a      importance of the ethical dimension of military operations, the risks\u000a      associated with ethical failure, and the opportunities to learn from the\u000a      US Army's White Paper on the Professional Military Ethic [C6].\u000a    The impacts of Rodin's work have considerable reach and significance.\u000a      Over the last decade, the work has contributed to a substantial shift of\u000a      the training in military ethics reaching thousands of military personnel,\u000a      in the US, UK and elsewhere, significantly shifting the understanding of\u000a      ethical choices, rights and responsibilities in combat and war.\u000a    Military practice has seen changes consistent with these research\u000a      insights. While armed forces never comment on their rules of engagement,\u000a      press reports suggest that UK Rules of Engagement now permit the use of\u000a      lethal force against enemy combatants only if they are posing an imminent\u000a      threat to another person [C7]. This represents a course of action\u000a      that is neither required by international law, nor by the previous\u000a      consensus; it is consistent with the insight that liability for the use of\u000a      force must be based on individual responsibility for unjust harm and that\u000a      enemy combatant status of itself is not sufficient to justify the use of\u000a      lethal force.\u000a    In sum, Rodin's work has made a contribution to the way stakeholders in\u000a      the US and UK - ranging from strategic leaders to those participating in\u000a      combat operations - weigh their own responsibilities and rights and those\u000a      of others in killing and war.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In the last decade, the traditional view of military ethics among\u000a      practitioners and scholars has been challenged by revisionist approaches\u000a      to Just War Theory. David Rodin's work has played a significant\u000a      part in the development of the revisionist school and in its subsequent\u000a      impacts on Western militaries. His research on individual responsibility\u000a      in war, the limitations of traditional justifications of war, and jus\u000a        terminatio (the ethical norms applicable to the termination of war)\u000a      has - as part of the revisionist school - opened up new approaches to\u000a      military ethics and the way militaries understand their rights and\u000a      responsibilities and those of others in war. Rodin's research has had\u000a      significant impact in re-shaping training on ethics for military personnel\u000a      and senior civil servants in the US, UK and beyond, and is informing\u000a      changes in the doctrine and practice of Western militaries.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Oxford\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000aR1.

The revisionist school,\u000a      and Rodin's work specifically, has challenged the traditional\u000a      state-centric view of military ethics, and placed the `individual' at the\u000a      centre of the ethics of war. Three research insights are central to the\u000a      impacts described below:\u000a    (a) Individual responsibility and human rights in war:\u000a    A fundamental argument of Rodin's work is that individuals (rather than\u000a      states) are the basic unit of moral analysis in war. This renders human\u000a      rights the foundational moral framework for the ethics of war [R1,\u000a        R4]. It follows that particular attention must be paid to problems\u000a      of self-defence and forfeiture of rights along with concepts of liability,\u000a      moral agency, excuse and justification [R1, R2, R3, R4, R6].\u000a    The research also argues that combatants are not morally equal, and those\u000a      fighting in an unjust war do not possess the same rights as combatants in\u000a      a just war [R1, R4]. It makes the case for restrictive\u000a        asymmetry, a principle which establishes that combatants bear\u000a      personal responsibility merely for participating in an unjust war. It also\u000a      argues that there is no justification for the claim that combatants\u000a      fighting in a just war are sometimes permitted to intentionally target\u000a      unjust non- combatants. [R4].\u000a    (b) Limitations of traditional justifications of war:\u000a    Rodin's research shows that traditional accounts of military ethics are\u000a      overly permissive and have consistently granted states and military actors\u000a      more latitude for inflicting harm than can be morally justified. The work\u000a      highlights problems with the justification of war in terms of\u000a      self-defence: since war is not analogous to personal self-defence and is\u000a      not a collective enterprise reducible to individual acts of self-defence,\u000a      it cannot be justified as a form of self-defence [R1]. Equally\u000a      problematic is the justification of war in response to bloodless\u000a        invasion: attacks on the sovereignty or territorial integrity of\u000a      states are not necessarily sufficient just cause for war since these can\u000a      occur without threatening life or vital interests of any individual\u000a      persons [R1].\u000a    (c) Jus terminatio - the moral and legal considerations that govern\u000a          the termination of war:\u000a    Rodin (in parallel with Darrel Moellendorf at San Diego State\u000a      University), developed the sub-field of jus terminatio within Just\u000a        War Theory. Jus terminatio refers to the moral and legal\u000a      considerations that govern the termination of a war and the transition to\u000a      a state of peace. Rodin's research shows that the issues arising during\u000a      the termination of war are distinct from the three traditional pillars of\u000a      Just War Theory - jus ad bellum (the morality of resort to war),\u000a        jus in bello (the morality of action in war) and jus post bellum\u000a      (the morality of action after war ends). The work describes the ethical\u000a      costs and benefits that emerge during war and its termination and develops\u000a      an account of the way these affect assessments of proportionality of\u000a      action [R5, R6].\u000a    Rodin's contributions to revisionist Just War Theory arise from\u000a      research carried out at the University of Oxford since 2000 as a Junior\u000a      Research Fellow (2000-02), Senior Research Fellow (2003-08) at the Oxford\u000a      Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, and then its Co-Director\u000a      (2008-present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3682","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"203312","Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Roberts' research has had substantial impact on national and\u000d\u000a      international policy formation in five\u000d\u000a      areas:\u000d\u000a    (i) Impact on initiatives to reform UK and US military training:\u000d\u000a      Since 2003 Roberts has been a member of the UK Defence Academy Advisory\u000d\u000a      Board, which\u000d\u000a      includes three academic representatives and gives advice on all the\u000d\u000a      activities of the Defence\u000d\u000a      Academy.

Since 1993, two central strands of his research\u000d\u000a      have focussed on (a) the\u000d\u000a      changing character of conflict and (b) the laws of war. From 2003 to 2013\u000d\u000a      much of the work in both\u000d\u000a      areas was completed as part of the Leverhulme-funded University of Oxford\u000d\u000a      programme, `The\u000d\u000a      Changing Character of War', for which Roberts was one of the original\u000d\u000a      Co-Investigators and a\u000d\u000a      Steering Committee member. Within the programme, he led research on the\u000d\u000a      laws of war, the\u000d\u000a      treatment of civilians and detainees in war, and the roles of the UN\u000d\u000a      Security Council.\u000d\u000a    (a) The changing character of conflict:\u000d\u000a      Roberts' work analyses changes in the nature of conflicts within and\u000d\u000a      between states since 1945,\u000d\u000a      including civil (i.e. non-violent) forms of resistance, the increase in\u000d\u000a      the multilateral use of armed\u000d\u000a      forces for peacekeeping and other purposes, the decline in the incidence\u000d\u000a      of major wars between\u000d\u000a      developed states, and the rise in civil wars, mainly in post-colonial\u000d\u000a      states. Two aspects of this work\u000d\u000a      are closely linked to the impacts described. Firstly, the research shows\u000d\u000a      that international normative\u000d\u000a      principles, courts and institutions play a significant part in shaping and\u000d\u000a      constraining these new\u000d\u000a      forms of conflict [Section 3: R2, R5]. Secondly, it makes evident\u000d\u000a      that an understanding of the\u000d\u000a      specific context and path dependency of contemporary conflicts &#8212; including\u000d\u000a      different national\u000d\u000a      perspectives, histories, political systems, religions, cultures and\u000d\u000a      languages &#8212; is essential to an\u000d\u000a      accurate analysis of these wars and to the effectiveness of policy\u000d\u000a      responses [R1, R3, R6].\u000d\u000a    (b) The laws of war:\u000d\u000a      Roberts' research demonstrates the enduring relevance of existing\u000d\u000a      international law in new\u000d\u000a      contexts &#8212; including peacekeeping operations, new types of military\u000d\u000a      occupations, responses to\u000d\u000a      terrorism, environmental despoliation in war, and the deployment of new\u000d\u000a      weaponry [R2, R4, R6].\u000d\u000a      For instance, he documents the significance of rules relating to the\u000d\u000a      protection of civilians and the\u000d\u000a      treatment of detainees, and shows that existing laws often play a powerful\u000d\u000a      role in assisting military\u000d\u000a      objectives by harmonizing the practices of allies (for example, within\u000d\u000a      NATO), and in influencing\u000d\u000a      domestic and international opinion. His work analyses how existing laws of\u000d\u000a      war are tested by new\u000d\u000a      types of conflict and how they evolve in response to particular challenges\u000d\u000a      [R2, R3, R6]. Roberts'\u000d\u000a      work also highlights gaps in the implementation and enforcement of the\u000d\u000a      law, and draws attention to\u000d\u000a      the importance of both military and judicial responses to war crimes and\u000d\u000a      crimes against humanity.\u000d\u000a      The research draws out the implications of these insights for the work of\u000d\u000a      national militaries, the UN,\u000d\u000a      NATO, and for international security in general [R4, R5, R6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3683","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The two central impacts of McLean's research have been (1) to contribute\u000a      to a change in the Treasury's methods of collecting and calculating\u000a      regional expenditure data, now used to guide policy and analysis, and (2)\u000a      to shape acceptance of a needs-based approach to regional funding as an\u000a      appropriate basis for the reform of funding arrangements for Scotland and\u000a      Wales.\u000a    (1) Contributing to a change in the methods for recording and\u000a          calculating regional public expenditure across all UK\u000a          government departments\u000a    HM Treasury accepted the recommendations of the McLean Report on\u000a      recording and calculating regional expenditure data in full. Following\u000a      specific recommendations of the report, HM Treasury and the Office for\u000a      National Statistics (ONS) developed a joint approach to the calculation of\u000a      more reliable figures on domestic (and European) regional expenditure to\u000a      inform the Public Expenditure Statistical Analysis (PESA). In\u000a      2008, the Treasury rolled out requirements for all departments to use\u000a      these methods for collecting and issuing data and provided detailed\u000a      guidance based on the McLean Report on how to attribute various\u000a      types of spending in the now annually required PESA return. This allows\u000a      policy debates to be informed increasingly by a more accurate picture of\u000a      the fiscal position of the UK's twelve regions [C1].\u000a    The McLean Report also underlined that appropriate data reports\u000a      should be produced for policy- makers; tailored reports are now used to\u000a      assess specific outcomes such as the effects of formula funding, demand\u000a      driven expenditure, and expenditure based on policy decisions. The impact\u000a      of these changes has been gradual, as departments have increasingly\u000a      produced better data. Only now, for instance, is the true level of EU farm\u000a      support across the UK's regions becoming clear, and McLean's methods\u000a      continue to underpin Treasury initiatives. As the Permanent Secretary at\u000a      HM Treasury noted in his opening remarks, at recent meeting for academics\u000a      working on public finance (25.01.2013), \"we use the McLean Report all the\u000a      time here\" [C2]. As well as informing PESA, McLean's analysis is\u000a      also used by the ONS in order to produce their regional Gross Value Added\u000a      tables and by the Scottish Government for the publication of their annual\u000a      expenditure and revenue publication [C2].\u000a    The beneficiaries of the reforms to the Treasury's Public Expenditure\u000a        Statistical Analysis include not only politicians, civil servants,\u000a      analysts, and journalists who rely on the PESA statistics to make\u000a      assessments of the effects of regional spending, but also stakeholders in\u000a      discussions about the spatial redistribution of public expenditure in the\u000a      UK. For example, this data is used in the Institute for Public Policy\u000a      Research's (IPPR) analysis of public funding in the North of England which\u000a      provides northern stakeholders with a better evidence base and an\u000a      understanding of the spending review process; the data is also used in\u000a      current debates about Scottish independence [C3].\u000a    (2) Shaping efforts to replace the Barnett Formula by a fairer\u000a          funding formula responsive to needs\u000a    McLean's analysis of the limitations of the Barnett formula has shaped\u000a      acceptance of the need for a change of the funding formula for Scotland\u000a      and Wales and the wider policy debate about fiscal devolution.\u000a    Scotland: McLean's research on the effects of the Barnett Formula\u000a      contributed to the launch of a joint initiative by the UK government and\u000a      Scottish Parliament to replace Barnett as the mechanism to adjust public\u000a      expenditure for Scotland. McLean was appointed to the Independent Expert\u000a      Group, which advised the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution\u000a      in 2008-9 with a view to improving the financial accountability of the\u000a      Scottish Parliament [C4]. The Expert Group's four reports were\u000a      adopted by the Commission, including its core recommendation that the UK\u000a      should vacate 10p in the pound of Income Tax for Scottish taxpayers, and\u000a      that the Scottish Parliament should be required to set a rate for funding\u000a      devolved services. This recommendation became part of the Scotland Bill.\u000a    Independently of the Expert Group's work McLean also contributed to the\u000a      wider policy debate about the funding regime for Scotland by giving\u000a      evidence to the Scotland Bill Committee of the Scottish Parliament [C5],\u000a      and by publishing in the media on the Calman proposal to make the Scottish\u000a      Parliament responsible for decisions at the margin between taxing less and\u000a      spending more [C6].\u000a    The Scotland Bill was endorsed by both the Scottish and UK Parliaments\u000a      and now forms the Scotland Act 2012 [C7], which is set to create a\u000a      democratically elected and fiscally responsible Parliament for the first\u000a      time since 1707. If the Scottish people reject independence, the Scotland\u000a      Act will come into operation immediately. If they accept independence, the\u000a      scheme will remain available to both governments &#8212; Scotland and UK &#8212; as a\u000a      model for reforming fiscal transfers. In either case, the Barnett Formula\u000a      is now likely to expire and to be replaced a more needs-guided approach.\u000a    Wales: McLean's research insights on the Barnett formula [R1]\u000a      also played a role in informing the proposal by the Independent\u000a        Commission on Funding and Finance for Wales (the Holtham\u000a        Commission) to replace Barnett with a needs-based funding regime for\u000a      Wales. The Commission was established by the Welsh Assembly Government to\u000a      consider the benefits and drawbacks of the Barnett Formula, and to\u000a      identify possible alternative funding mechanisms including tax-raising and\u000a      borrowing powers. McLean was invited twice to speak at the Holtham\u000a        Commission in 2009-10, and presented evidence on the effects of the\u000a      Barnett Formula and arguments for a more needs- based funding regime [C8].\u000a      His analysis that the Barnett Formula failed to give Wales a block grant\u000a      that was commensurate for its needs was accepted by the Commission. In its\u000a      final report, published in July 2010, the Commission recommended that the\u000a      Assembly Government should pursue the introduction of a needs-based\u000a      formula for determining the Welsh block grant instead of the Barnett\u000a      Formula, a recommendation that is entirely consistent with McLean's\u000a      arguments and findings [C9]. The Holtham Commission's\u000a      final report was welcomed by Labour, Conservative and Plaid Cymru\u000a      politicians and is contributing to the growing weight of evidence against\u000a      the Barnett Formula in the debate about the funding regime for Wales.\u000a    In sum, McLean's research has generated impacts of UK-wide reach and\u000a      lasting significance: the McLean Report informed the Treasury's\u000a      reforms of the PESA-regime which has resulted in more accurate regional\u000a      expenditure data across the United Kingdom. This change allows policy and\u000a      debate to be informed increasingly by the true fiscal position of the\u000a      twelve UK regions. The revised data has also helped McLean to demonstrate\u000a      the need to reform the Barnett Formula, which influenced the conclusions\u000a      of the Calman and Holtham Commissions, as well as the\u000a      fiscal structure for Scotland envisaged in the Scotland Act 2012, and\u000a      contributed to the growing acceptance of a needs-based formula for\u000a      determining the block grant for Wales.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Professor Iain McLean and his team has demonstrated that for\u000a      more than 30 years, the process of distributing public expenditure to the\u000a      regions of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales was hampered by\u000a      inadequate data and inappropriate policy targets.

He has a long record of research and publication on spatial issues\u000a      in taxation and public expenditure; he led the Public Expenditure\u000a        Research Group (19 collaborators and staff) examining regional\u000a      expenditure data, and has carried out work on the fiscal transfer\u000a      formulae.\u000a    Since their introduction in 1888, UK regional funding formulae have\u000a      relied on poor data and have been hampered by a lack of clear objectives\u000a      as to whether funding should be distributed per capita or\u000a      allocated in a needs-sensitive way. McLean's research on the regional\u000a      funding regime has demonstrated inadequacies in the underlying regional\u000a      expenditure data, and recommended improvements to the methods used for its\u000a      collection and calculation. This work has laid the basis for a better and\u000a      more accurate understanding of the distortive effects of the regional\u000a      funding formulae, and for McLean's recommendations to reform the formulae\u000a      in order to achieve fairer and more needs-based outcomes. Work in both of\u000a      these areas is central to the impacts described below.\u000a    (a) Developing a methodology to produce reliable expenditure data\u000a    In the early 2000's the Treasury (and researchers including McLean)\u000a      expressed concern about the reliability of official data on public\u000a      expenditure per head in the nine regions of England and in the devolved\u000a      administrations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Flawed data\u000a      could undermine the usefulness of the Treasury's Public Expenditure\u000a        Statistical Analyses (PESA) as a source of information to guide\u000a      policy affecting the regions across the full range of government\u000a      departments. As a result of his expertise in this area [R2], the\u000a      Treasury asked McLean to assess the quality of the data and he assembled a\u000a      research group to do so. The year-long research programme, launched in\u000a      2002, examined the level and form of public expenditure (domestic and\u000a      European) to the regions. It revealed substantial inadequacies and\u000a      significant variability in the data, inconsistencies in reporting data\u000a      between government departments, and conceptual and methodological\u000a      differences underpinning regional reporting [R4, R6]. It also drew\u000a      attention to the fact that different definitions of regional expenditure\u000a      were used not only across government departments, but also by the Treasury\u000a      and the Office for National Statistics. The research made a number of\u000a      recommendations to improve data quality in 2003 that were summarized in\u000a      the McLean Report (Identifying the Flow of Domestic and\u000a        European Expenditure into the English Regions) [R6]. One of\u000a      McLean's central recommendations was that departments should use real\u000a      expenditure data whenever possible, rather than assume that spending per\u000a      head was equal in each region as had often been done in practice. McLean's\u000a      Public Expenditure Research Group included several co-researchers\u000a      at the University of Oxford: A. McMillan (Post-Doctoral fellow 2003 to\u000a      2006), C. Wlezien (Reader in Comparative Government 2002-2007), S.N.\u000a      Soroka (Post-Doctoral fellow 2000-2002) and G. Cameron (University\u000a      Lecturer 2000-2006, University Reader in Macroeconomics, 2006 (deceased\u000a      2007)).\u000a    (b) Demonstrating the inadequacy of the existing funding formulae\u000a    McLean's research then addressed how a more accurate and more\u000a      incentive-compatible regime of transfers might be introduced to replace\u000a      the Barnett Formula which has historically been applied to determine the\u000a      block grant to the three devolved administrations of the UK &#8212; Scotland,\u000a      Wales and Northern Ireland. This work demonstrated that the Barnett\u000a      Formula, which is population-based and takes no account of relative needs,\u000a      has benefitted Scotland and disadvantaged Wales. McLean showed equal\u000a      spending per capita to be an inappropriate policy target [R1, R3],\u000a      and recommended that fairer and less distortive regimes of territorial\u000a      transfers should be introduced to replace the Barnett Formula. The\u000a      research argued that the introduction of a needs-based formula to replace\u000a      Barnett would not undermine a devolved government's autonomy in making\u000a      decisions on public spending, and recommended that proposed replacements\u000a      for the Barnett Formula should increase the options for devolved\u000a      administrations to raise revenue and enhance fiscal responsibility [R5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4578","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Over the last five years, Stears' research on the democratic ideas and\u000a      practice of previous eras\u000a      has informed a process of political change on the left of UK politics. His\u000a      emphasis on the\u000a      importance of grass-roots involvement, participatory democratic\u000a      organisation, and communitarian\u000a      ideals has helped to define a new democratic agenda for the British Left,\u000a      shaped proposals to\u000a      introduce more participatory policy processes in a range of policy areas,\u000a      and influenced the\u000a      debates about political orientation and organisation within the Labour\u000a      Party.\u000a    (1) Shaping a democratic agenda for the British Left\u000a      On the basis of the research presented in Demanding Democracy [R1]\u000a      and related works, Stears\u000a      was invited in 2010 by the think tank Demos to participate in a research\u000a      project on the ways in\u000a      which British politics might benefit from developments in democratic\u000a      research. Stears wrote a\u000a      paper entitled Active Equality [C1]; drawing extensively\u000a      on Demanding Democracy, he argued that\u000a      the centre-left would benefit from a return to the more decentralised and\u000a      participative approaches\u000a      to policymaking and implementation that had marked earlier historical\u000a      moments in Britain and\u000a      America [R1 &amp; R4]. Stears was then asked by Maurice Glasman\u000a      and others to help convene a\u000a      series of seminars on new directions for policymaking and party\u000a      organisation (hosted by University\u000a      College, Oxford and London Metropolitan University). These seminars were\u000a      attended by heads of\u000a      major think tanks, Labour politicians, senior journalists and\u000a      representatives of civil society bodies.\u000a      Stears produced one of three major papers for the seminars, entitled Democracy,\u000a        Leadership and\u000a        Organising. The collected papers were published electronically\u000a      (simultaneously by the Christian\u000a      Socialist Movement, Compass, the Fabian Society, and Progress and\u000a      Soundings) as The Labour\u000a        Tradition and the Politics of Paradox (downloaded over 100,000 times\u000a      in the first month after\u000a      publication) and became popularly known as the Blue Labour Book [C2].\u000a      The book provided the\u000a      foundation for the subsequent impact of Stears' research within the\u000a      Institute for Public Policy\u000a      Research (IPPR) and then within the Labour Party.\u000a    (2) Shaping the agenda of the Institute for Public Policy Research\u000a      On the basis of his research and contributions to the Blue Labour\u000a      debate Stears was invited by the\u000a      IPPR to help re-direct its research agenda (2010-13). He produced a short\u000a      book, Everyday\u000a        Democracy (2011) that presented the major findings of his previous\u000a      research in an accessible\u000a      format. The book argued that democracy can be enhanced by empowering\u000a      people and\u000a      communities to influence policymaking and implementation, through\u000a      decentralization and everyday\u000a      forms of participation [C3].These ideas challenged the traditional\u000a      Westminster model of top-down\u000a      policymaking, and helped to refocus IPPR's approach so as to take account\u000a      of the importance of\u000a      democratic participation in decision-making. Stears applied his insights\u000a      in structuring IPPR\u000a      projects, including work on housing policy, cultural integration, the\u000a      living wage, responsible\u000a      business practices, and social security policy [C4]. He also\u000a      convened a series of internal and\u000a      external seminars introducing IPPR researchers to major new ideas in\u000a      political theory, especially\u000a      ideas related to the \"new realism\" [R3]. These resulted in changes\u000a      in the intellectual direction of\u000a      IPPR which are described in detail by the Director Nick Pearce in a recent\u000a      article for the IPPR\u000a      journal Juncture [C10].\u000a    (3) Reviving communitarian and democratic ideals in Labour Party\u000a          ideology: One Nation Labour\u000a      On the basis of his contributions in re-shaping the broader agenda for the\u000a      British Left, Stears was\u000a      invited to work for the Labour Party itself. In 2012 he was asked by Ed\u000a      Miliband to assist in the\u000a      production of his annual conference speech on the idea of `One Nation' [C5].\u000a      In working on the\u000a      speech Stears drew extensively on his research concerning the relationship\u000a      between\u000a      communitarian and democratic politics [R1]. The speech contributed\u000a      significantly to Miliband's\u000a      wider efforts to reshape the Party's identity - the One Nation Project\u000a      - in which Stears has\u000a      remained closely involved. The Project emphasizes ideas of power sharing,\u000a      and of reforming the\u000a      state and market to enable a politics that is bottom-up not top-down, that\u000a      is organised rather than\u000a      managed - objectives that reflect the research based ideas advocated by\u000a      Stears.\u000a    The One Nation Project has had a significant impact within the party\u000a    and beyond. It promoted\u000a    public debate [C6] and triggered a new electronic publication, the One\u000a      Nation Register, viewed by\u000a    many younger Labour MPs as a campaigning tool and ideological guide for the\u000a    Party [C7]. It also\u000a    resulted in a major academic conference at Queen Mary (University of London,\u000a    April 2013), and a\u000a    series of public lectures at the London School of Economics, hosted by the\u000a    Director Craig Calhoun.\u000a    (4) Working towards a greater emphasis on participatory democracy\u000a          in Labour Party\u000a          organisation: The Collins Review\u000a      Stears also contributed to initiatives to reform Labour Party\u000a      organisation, in which he drew on his\u000a      work on democratic organisational practices. He was invited to work with\u000a      the leading community\u000a      organiser Arnie Graf, who had been recruited by the Party to re-energise\u000a      democratic practices at\u000a      the grass-roots level. Graf and Stears worked closely together to pursue\u000a      the party's aspiration to\u000a      become a more democratic, community based organisation [C8].\u000a      Stears also influenced the\u000a      establishment of the Collins Review into the structure of Labour\u000a      Party membership [C8]. The\u000a      Collins Review: Building a One Nation Labour Party was announced by\u000a      Ed Miliband in a speech in\u000a      July 2013. Stears was involved extensively in the preparation of\u000a      Miliband's speech and influenced\u000a      the terms of reference for the Review, which reflect many of his\u000a      research-based ideas for\u000a      participatory democracy [R1, R5]. For instance, Collins has a\u000a      mandate to review the automatic\u000a      affiliation of trade union members to the Labour Party and to consider new\u000a      ways for members to\u000a      participate in Party decision-making [C9]. These terms of\u000a      reference give the Collins Review the\u000a      scope to recommend the most radical and extensive reforms to the Party's\u000a      internal organisation\u000a      since it adopted its constitution in 1918.\u000a    In short, Stears' research has contributed to a renewed focus of the\u000a      Labour Party and the wider\u000a      policy community on participation, community based organisation, and\u000a      grass-roots based\u000a      approaches to policymaking and implementation. Since 2010, his work has\u000a      had significant impact\u000a      in shaping Labour's One Nation Project and the organisational\u000a      choices of the party. Its reach and\u000a      significance is evidenced by Stears' appointment by Ed Miliband as Chief\u000a      Speechwriter to the\u000a      Leader of the Opposition until the next general election. With the support\u000a      of the Department, Stears\u000a      took up that role on secondment in May 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Stears' research addresses a widespread concern that modern\u000a      political parties are\u000a      increasingly disconnected from traditions of democratic participation,\u000a      with adverse consequences\u000a      for political engagement and the wider quality of democracy.

His goal is to relate developments in theory -\u000a      especially the debate\u000a      between `deliberative democrats' and `democratic realists' - to the\u000a      democratic ideals of actual\u000a      political movements. The research focuses on traditions of\u000a      twentieth-century democratic thinking\u000a      that are explicitly anti-bureaucratic, sceptical of expert elites,\u000a      concerned with grass-roots\u000a      community organising, and interested in developing mass participation and\u000a      the education of local\u000a      democratic leaderships.\u000a    This work speaks to a normative concern that present day politics and\u000a      parties have become too\u000a      disconnected from the communities they represent, and that the quality of\u000a      democracy is harmed by\u000a      the failure to secure substantively meaningful and effective participation\u000a      in the political process. Its\u000a      aim is to recover traditions of democratic thought that offer insights\u000a      relevant to building more\u000a      participatory, legitimate, and just forms of democracy.\u000a    Democratic theory\u000a      Stears' research shows that many of the fundamental democratic ideas in\u000a      the political movements\u000a      he examined have vanished from serious debate in more recent democratic\u000a      theory. His work\u000a      argues for the continued relevance of these earlier insights, particularly\u000a      in thinking on:\u000a    \u000a      the relationship between communitarian and democratic ideals - that\u000a        democratic ideals\u000a        depend on strong communitarian norms [R1];\u000a      the necessary qualities of leadership - that qualities of\u000a        collaboration and cooperation are\u000a        necessary to the exercise of leadership in democratic societies and\u000a        organisations [R1];\u000a\u000a      the nature of political virtue - that self-restraint and established\u000a        practices of complex social\u000a        reciprocity are vital to the success of social movements [R1];\u000a\u000a      the connection between immediate concerns and long-term efforts at\u000a        social transformation -\u000a        that short-term crises are often essential catalysts of long-term social\u000a        change [R6];\u000a\u000a      the relationship between organisational forms of movements and the\u000a        nature of fundamental\u000a        political ideas - that it is possible to mitigate the apparent tensions\u000a        between the radicalism\u000a        of movement politics and the more conservative tendencies of mainstream\u000a        political\u000a        representation [R5].\u000a    \u000a    Contemporary democratic theory, the work argues, has become unhelpfully\u000a      distanced from the\u000a      day-to-day concerns of actual political practitioners, and contemporary\u000a      political practice requires\u000a      more guidance from democratic theory than it is currently offered [R1,\u000a        R3]. Stears' work aims to\u000a      revive these forgotten theoretical traditions because they relate directly\u000a      and immediately to\u000a      contemporary politics.\u000a    American democratic traditions\u000a      In 2006, Stears was awarded a Leverhulme Research Fellowship to pursue a\u000a      major study of the\u000a      American democratic tradition. This area of research traces the\u000a      development of radical democratic\u000a      thinking across the 20th century [R2, R4]. The work\u000a      culminated in the publication of a monograph,\u000a      Demanding Democracy: American Radicals in Search of a New Politics\u000a      [R1], which seeks to\u000a      recover ideas that can re-energize democratic activism today. Stears\u000a      argues that contemporary\u000a      politics can learn from the radical democratic traditions forged in the\u000a      twentieth century by political\u000a      activists, including progressives, trade unionists, civil rights\u000a      campaigners, and members of the\u000a      student New Left. Re-evaluating the moral and strategic arguments, and the\u000a      triumphs and\u000a      excesses, of this radical democratic tradition, Stears contends that it\u000a      still offers a compelling\u000a      account of citizen behaviour - one that is fairer, more inclusive, and\u000a      more truly democratic than\u000a      those advanced by political theorists today.\u000a    The New Realism\u000a      Stears develops these ideas further in studies of the \"new realism\" in\u000a      political theory. This research\u000a      benefitted from a sustained collaboration with the leading political\u000a      philosopher, Bonnie Honig\u000a      (Brown University USA\/American Bar Foundation) whose work similarly\u000a      examines the ways in\u000a      which democratic political theory can be brought into closer and more\u000a      profitable relationship with\u000a      real world political concerns [R3]. Honig and Stears' essay on the\u000a      \"new realism\" builds on a\u000a      critique of much contemporary political theory as too ahistorical,\u000a      abstract and removed from the\u000a      political realities that the theory is supposed to help us understand. The\u000a      research proposes a \"new\u000a      realism\" in political theory that is sensitive to lived experience, alert\u000a      to the politics of power and\u000a      exclusion, and that draws from history the aspiration to press beyond the\u000a      status quo - an\u000a      aspiration to struggle for forms of democracy that offer greater\u000a      legitimacy and justice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4579","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The UN Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) has responsibility within the UN\u000a      system for advising on and proposing integrated strategies for\u000a      post-conflict peacebuilding and recovery.

The PBSO asked Caplan to draw on\u000a      and extend his previous research to understand how they might better\u000a      support the transition of a peace operation as it moves from initial\u000a      stabilization towards consolidation. It was interested specifically in\u000a      research that might assist it in making recommendations to the Commission\u000a      on when to `graduate' a country on its agenda.\u000a    (1) Identifying operational challenges to UN transitional\u000a          strategies\u000a      Building on his research insights [R2], Caplan produced a study\u000a      for the PBSO, published as an inter-agency briefing paper in March 2008,\u000a      which demonstrated:\u000a    \u000a      a lack of conceptual clarity within the UN system with regard to\u000a        `peace consolidation,' `transition' and `exit strategies' and other key\u000a        concepts;\u000a      the absence of agreed-upon criteria with respect to gauging the\u000a        achievement of a peace operation's principal objectives;\u000a      the absence of system-wide country monitoring methodologies to inform\u000a        UN planning; the inappropriate use of benchmarking to chart progress\u000a        towards consolidated peace within countries;\u000a      limited planning capacity within and between some UN agencies to\u000a        support sequencing and transition and a lack of adequate structures to\u000a        share information and plan jointly;\u000a      lack of broad knowledge in the UN system concerning the actual\u000a        experience of transition and exit; and\u000a      structural and political factors inhibiting the emergence of effective\u000a        strategies to support transition, including uncertainty with regard to\u000a        the time and resources available, making it difficult to develop sound\u000a        strategic plans [C2].\u000a\u000a    \u000a    Caplan presented the initial findings of his research to the UN\u000a      Peacebuilding Commission in New York on 17 December 2007. This briefing\u000a      was the first time an academic had been invited to address the PBC. Caplan\u000a      also presented his findings at a UN inter-agency seminar in New York on 20\u000a      December 2007 attended by representatives of the Department of\u000a      Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Political Affairs, the UN\u000a      Development Programme, and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for\u000a      Refugees. At the request of the Permanent Representative of Japan to the\u000a      United Nations, Caplan discussed the findings of his research with\u000a      representatives of Member States invited to the Japanese Mission on 18\u000a      December 2007. (The chair of the PBSO was Japan's representative to the\u000a      UN.)\u000a    The briefing paper formed the basis of an extensive UN Peacebuilding\u000a      Community of Practice (CoP) e-discussion on peace consolidation metrics\u000a      conducted in April and May 2008 that circulated to some 450 practitioners\u000a      in 20 UN agencies and departments. The consultation was widely welcomed by\u000a      participants and summaries show that the ideas for benchmarking of peace\u000a      consolidation as set out in Caplan's briefing paper were considered for\u000a      the most part both desirable and feasible [C3].\u000a     \u000a    (2) Defining an approach to UN benchmarking and the need for a\u000a          handbook\u000a      Thirty-five percent of all violent conflicts re-ignite within five years\u000a      of a negotiated peace. To respond to the fragility of the peace process,\u000a      Caplan's briefing paper recommended the production of a UN practitioners'\u000a      guide to benchmarking. By promoting more rigorous and systematic\u000a      assessment of progress towards a consolidated peace Caplan argued that\u000a      peacebuilding efforts could be recalibrated without jeopardising the\u000a      peace. Drawing on his research [R2, R4], Caplan recommended that a\u000a      practitioners' guide to benchmarking should:\u000a    \u000a      define key terms and offer broad-based criteria for measuring peace\u000a        consolidation;\u000a      present a Comprehensive Peace Consolidation Monitoring Matrix with\u000a        detailed benchmarking and indicative examples;\u000a      share the positive and negative lessons derived from benchmarking\u000a        exercises in UN peacebuilding operations;\u000a      make practical recommendations on the technical and financial\u000a        resources necessary for tracking progress across multiple sectors,\u000a        including critical national capacity gaps;\u000a      provide comparative country examples about the multiple factors that\u000a        can determine the pace of change towards a national environment\u000a        conducive to peace consolidation;\u000a      strengthen the UN's capacity for practical guidance to nationally led\u000a        and UN-supported Monitoring and Tracking Mechanisms.\u000a    \u000a    The briefing paper's recommendation for a handbook was adopted by the\u000a      PBC's Organizational Committee in June 2008 and a PBSO-sponsored UN Peace\u000a      Consolidation Benchmarking Experts workshop was held in New York in\u000a      November 2008. The background paper produced by the UN for the workshop\u000a      explicitly acknowledges the genesis of the handbook project in Caplan's\u000a      briefing paper, in its reference to the Measuring Peace Consolidation\u000a        and Supporting Transition briefing paper that informed this study\u000a      and the wider peace consolidation benchmarking project [C4].\u000a    In 2010, the United Nations, in cooperation with the Fafo Institute for\u000a      Applied International Studies and the Norwegian Peacebuilding Centre,\u000a      published Monitoring Peace Consolidation: United Nations\u000a      Practitioners' Guide to Benchmarking [C5].The contribution of\u000a      Caplan's briefing paper is again acknowledged&#8212;both directly and\u000a      indirectly&#8212;through the verbatim and paraphrased use of portions of the\u000a      briefing paper in the guide [C6].\u000a    (3) Integrating benchmarking and the use of the handbook within UN\u000a          policy and practice\u000a      Efforts have been under way since 2010 to integrate the guidance into UN\u000a      practice. These include use in regional training workshops and discussions\u000a      within PBSO about further development of benchmarking procedures and\u000a      systems. In December 2012 Caplan was consulted by personnel of the UN\u000a      Department of Peacekeeping Operations regarding the preparation of a\u000a      concept note that led to the adoption by the UN Secretary-General of a\u000a      `Policy on UN Transitions in the Context of Mission Drawdown or\u000a      Withdrawal' in February 2013. The Policy affirms several key principles of\u000a      sound management of transitions that were articulated in Caplan's study [C2],\u000a      notably early planning, UN integration, national ownership and national\u000a      capacity development [C7]. In February 2013 Caplan was invited by\u000a      the PBSO to undertake further research into political, social and economic\u000a      indicators of a stable peace in post-conflict settings to assist with\u000a      strengthening the development of UN benchmarking practices [C8].\u000a    Peacebuilding is an increasingly important component of strategy within\u000a      the international community, but it is a complex and often fraught\u000a      process. Caplan's research has helped UN institutions develop more\u000a      systematic criteria for evaluating progress on the road to peace.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Richard Caplan's research explores the challenges that arise in\u000a      the context of post- conflict peace- and state-building.

Caplan's Adelphi Paper, A New Trusteeship? was one of\u000a      the first pieces of major research to examine the international\u000a      administration of war-torn territories, a form of post- war reconstruction\u000a      and peacebuilding, to which the international community had begun to make\u000a      increasingly frequent recourse. Caplan developed this research\u000a      agenda in a co-edited special issue of Global Governance (2004) [R1],\u000a      his monograph, International Governance of War-Torn Territories\u000a      (2005) [R2] and a wide range of journal articles, including in International\u000a        Peacekeeping (2005) [R3], Civil Wars (2006) [R4]\u000a      and Third World Quarterly (2007) [R5].\u000a    This body of research examines the nature of international territorial\u000a      administrations&#8212;their mandates, structures and powers. The work also\u000a      explores the key challenges&#8212;operational, political and normative&#8212;that\u000a      arise in the context of administration by international organizations and\u000a      assesses the effectiveness of international authorities in meeting these\u000a      challenges. It probes the policy implications of recent experiences,\u000a      recommending reforms or new approaches to the practices associated with\u000a      international territorial administration.\u000a    Building on this research, Caplan began to focus more specifically on the\u000a      challenges associated with transitional and exit strategies. In 2007 he\u000a      initiated and led a project on `Exit Strategies and Peace Consolidation',\u000a      bringing together a team of 15 leading scholars and practitioners to\u000a      explore the experiences of, and scholarly and policy questions associated\u000a      with, exit in relation to four types of international operations where\u000a      state-building had been an objective: notably colonial administrations,\u000a      complex peace operations, international administrations and transformative\u000a      military occupations.\u000a    Three research findings stand out for the later interest and impact that\u000a      they would generate among practitioners:\u000a    a) Understanding the conditions for the successful completion of exit\u000a        processes: The research demonstrated that an exit is not an event\u000a      but a process of transition that is facilitated by successful mandate\u000a      implementation (if the mandate is suitably designed and resourced) and the\u000a      ability to refine the mandate to fit the circumstances on the ground as\u000a      they evolve. This requires a degree of flexibility and coordination that\u000a      is often difficult to achieve in the large and complex state-building\u000a      operations that characterise many peacebuilding efforts today.\u000a    b) Demonstrating lacunae in the current understanding of the\u000a        requirements for stable peace: The work demonstrated the\u000a      absence of a clear understanding among scholars and practitioners of the\u000a      requirements for a stable peace, generally or in relation to specific\u000a      cases, as a consequence of which an exit or transition may imperil a\u000a      fragile peace. This finding points to the need for more robust forms of\u000a      assessment of efforts to achieve peace consolidation.\u000a    c) Understanding the political nature of exit processes: The\u000a      research showed that exit is fundamentally a political process, the timing\u000a      and the nature of which are inevitably influenced by political factors\u000a      which may have little to do with progress on the ground. Effective\u000a      leadership may be required to counter pressures for withdrawal from\u000a      donors, troop-contributing countries and local authorities that can\u000a      undermine a fragile peace. [R6]\u000a    Findings of the research project were presented at a conference\u000a      co-chaired by Caplan at Wilton Park, the British Foreign Office-sponsored\u000a      conference centre, on 13-15 March 2009, which brought together some 35\u000a      representatives of governments and international organizations (including\u000a      the United Nations, NATO, the European Council, and the African Union)\u000a      with members of the research group. The project culminated with the\u000a      publication of Caplan's edited book Exit Strategies and State Building\u000a      (2012) [R6], and articles in Survival (2012) [R7]\u000a      and other publications.\u000a    The research was conducted at Oxford, where Richard Caplan was a Research\u000a      Fellow at the Department's Centre for International Studies from\u000a      2001-2003, when he was appointed a University Lecturer in International\u000a      Relations.

This took place within the context of the High Level Segment\u000a      (HLS) of the CND in 2014 and the United Nations General Assembly Special\u000a      Session on Drugs (UNGASS) in 2016. Ernesto Samper Pizano, President of\u000a      Colombia (1994-1998), has played an important role opening up the drug\u000a      policy debate within Latin America and it is of note that Bewley-Taylor's\u000a      research is also cited within Samper's recent book on the issue, Drogas\u000a        Drigas: Prohibici&#243;n o Legalizaci&#243;n. Una nueva propuesta (Debate\u000a      Books, 2013)\u000a    Within the UK, Bewley-Taylor is the expert advisor on international drug\u000a      policy to the All Party Parliamentary Group on Drug Policy Reform (APPG),\u000a      and participated in a key meeting of national drug `czars' and ambassadors\u000a      at the House of Lords in November 2011 to discuss possible alternatives to\u000a      the current system of UN drug control. His ideas on the formation of `Like\u000a      Minded Groups' is currently being applied in work with the APPG on the\u000a      development of a group of European states to support drug policy reform in\u000a      Latin America in the lead up to the HLS and UNGASS.

Indeed, as the following\u000a      testimonies demonstrate, while not claiming direct responsibility for\u000a      specific policy shifts, which result from highly complex processes of\u000a      change, his research can be seen to have had an impact in stimulating\u000a      debate among national, UN and European Union drug policy officials and\u000a      national ambassadors considering changes in policy or withdrawal of\u000a      existing policy.\u000a    - Former Head of the Drugs Policy Coordination Unit of the\u000a          European Commission, `I have found Bewley-Taylor's work on\u000a        the historical background, functioning, and future of the UN drug\u000a        control system extremely valuable for contextualizing the geopolitical\u000a        forces at play within what is a complex and fluid issue area. His\u000a        accurate and realistic analysis of `narco-diplomacy' in general, but\u000a        particularly in relation to the role of the United States and parts of\u000a        the UN drug control apparatus, helps provide the clarity necessary for\u000a        decision-making within a multi-dimensional policy environment such as\u000a        the Commission.'\u000a    - Member, Global Commission on Drug Policy, Geneva, Former\u000a        President of Switzerland and Minister of Home Affairs: `A\u000a      growing number of States Parties to the UN conventions are moving away\u000a      from a punitive approach to drug use, confronted with the public health\u000a      and the security challenges (or consequences) of the policy followed for\u000a      decades. Bewley-Taylor's ideas on `soft defection' from the control regime\u000a      and `regime weakening' provide a useful conceptual lens through which to\u000a      consider a global system more able to accommodate the complex and specific\u000a      needs of individual nation states.'\u000a    - Former Mexican Attorney General), former Ambassador of\u000a          Mexico to the UK, and Ambassador of Mexico to the US), Washington, DC,\u000a          USA: `Recent years have seen the regulatory regime of drugs\u000a        come under increasing scrutiny...

He has done much to reframe\u000a        the way `practitioners' within the policy community view the UN\u000a        environment, including the role of treaty bodies, both in terms of\u000a        broader historical context and future policy options.'\u000a    - Former UK Deputy Drug Czar and Head of Demand Reduction,\u000a          United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, current Chair of the IDPC\u000a          and advisor to the Global Commission on Drug Policy, London:\u000a        'From the perspective of someone involved in national and international\u000a        drug policy debates over many years, I can say that Bewley-Taylor's\u000a        research has done much to promote reconsideration of law enforcement\u000a        dominated policies dealing with the illicit drugs market.

His most\u000a      recent major output is International Drug Control: Consensus Fractured.\u000a      Funded by the Leverhulme Trust and the J. Paul Getty Jr. Charitable Trust,\u000a      this research involved an extensive set of elite interviews and informal\u000a      discussions with national government, European Union (EU) and UN\u000a      officials, both in post and retired, as well as members of reform-minded\u000a      drug policy non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In addition to\u000a      fieldwork in the UK, USA, Japan, Australia, Canada and continental Europe,\u000a      the work drew on participant observation of various UN Commission on\u000a      Narcotic Drugs (CND) meetings in Vienna, as a member of a number of NGO\u000a      delegations.\u000a    The book (R2) provides a unique fine-grained analysis of the operation of\u000a      the international drug control regime between 1998 and 2009. Through the\u000a      application of regime theory to empirical data, it introduces the twin\u000a      concepts of soft defection (movement by parties to the conventions away\u000a      from the regime's normative core that falls short of hard defection and\u000a      `breach') and resultant regime weakening (changes within rather\u000a      than of the regime). Key examples of policy approaches behind this\u000a      transformative process include engagement with the harm reduction approach\u000a      and the decriminalisation of cannabis possession for personal use within\u000a      many European states. As parts of a new framework, these concepts allow a\u000a      better understanding of changes within the UN drug control regime.\u000a      Highlighting shortcomings of the extant regime, including in relation to\u000a      human rights and health related issues, Consensus Fractured also\u000a      presents possible routes for revision of the UN drug control treaties upon\u000a      which it is based. Journal articles in 2012 and 2013 (R1 and R3)\u000a      accompanied the monograph by developing some of these themes.\u000a    Underpinning research dates back to late 1999 and the publication of\u000a      Bewley-Taylor's first monograph (R5). This monograph is seen as one\u000a      of the key texts in the field of international drug policy. Based on\u000a      extensive archive work, it deconstructs the evolution of the international\u000a      drug control system, and argues that the current US influenced UN\u000a      conventions deleteriously limit the space of sovereign states in\u000a      developing health oriented and culturally specific national drug control\u000a      policies and as such require reform. This work was followed by a number of\u000a      related journal articles and grey literature reports, prominent among them\u000a      `Challenging the UN drug control conventions: problems and possibilities'\u000a      (R6) in 2003.\u000a    A combination of the monograph (R5) and a series of other publications\u000a      (including R4 and R6) raised Bewley-Taylor's profile as an expert and\u000a      `opinion former' in the field and widened impact reach, including his\u000a      engagement with a range of NGOs, governments and international bodies,\u000a      among them the European Commission (EC), with an interest in aspects of\u000a      international drug control.\u000a    The most recent related research project, funded by the Open Society\u000a      Foundations, focuses on policy transfer and counter-narcotic strategies in\u000a      Afghanistan. Involving fieldwork in Kabul and interviews and policy\u000a      discussions with Afghan government officials as well as UN and NGO\u000a      representatives, the findings reveal the role that the normative\u000a      expectancy of the UN treaties has on the development of Afghan\u000a      counter-narcotic strategies. Associated research will continue under the\u000a      auspices of the newly established Global Drug Policy Observatory (See\u000a      section 3).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5850","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    a) The development of the new IB Diploma Programme course:\u000d\u000a    Dr Brocklehurst's analysis of children's exposure to educational\u000d\u000a      materials on war and terrorism and call for greater attention to their\u000d\u000a      critical literacy has secured and informed her three-year contribution as\u000d\u000a      external Curriculum Developer for the International Baccalaureate\u000d\u000a      Organisation. In October 2009, Dr Brocklehurst was invited to participate\u000d\u000a      in a multidisciplinary, international working group, developing a course\u000d\u000a      for the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme. The IB very\u000d\u000a      rarely designs new courses but was responding to growing interest in\u000d\u000a      current affairs and considering the revision of small specialist courses,\u000d\u000a      including IR and Peace and Conflict studies, or the design of a new model\u000d\u000a      to replace these.\u000d\u000a    In the first session of this process, chaired by the Curriculum Leader\u000d\u000a      for Humanities, Social Sciences and the Arts (C1), she gave examples of\u000d\u000a      her research on children's informal consumption of global politics and war\u000d\u000a      (R4) and the risks of not encouraging their critical capacities given\u000d\u000a      their exposure to partial accounts of power. She made the case for\u000d\u000a      planning a global curriculum that was sensitive to children as political\u000d\u000a      stakeholders and exposed, but did not privilege, the discipline of IR\u000d\u000a      (R2). She was subsequently invited to participate fully in the development\u000d\u000a      of the syllabus, and assessment models as a paid Curriculum Developer,\u000d\u000a      including attendance at six, three-day, closed meetings over three years.\u000d\u000a      Dr Brocklehurst framed `global politics' as a useful overarching framework\u000d\u000a      and emphasised the need for sensitivity in the way in which key concepts\u000d\u000a      (such as power or cooperation) were positioned and weighted throughout the\u000d\u000a      drafting process. A testimonial on this contribution (C1) states that Dr\u000d\u000a      Brocklehurst was `instrumental in helping shape the structure of the IB\u000d\u000a        course, supporting the location of `power' and `IR' as compulsory core\u000d\u000a        elements, within a context of critical thinking skills'. The current\u000d\u000a      IB Curriculum manager (C2) has stated that:\u000d\u000a    `Dr. Brocklehurst's expertise, academic background and enthusiasm have\u000d\u000a        meant that she has been able to make a really significant contribution\u000d\u000a        to the development of the new IB Diploma Programme global politics\u000d\u000a        course &#8212; a course which will ultimately be offered to schools in over\u000d\u000a        140 countries around the world. She has been able to advise us on the\u000d\u000a        importance of including elements of IR such as peace and cooperation in\u000d\u000a        the course rather than it focusing primarily on conflict, and has\u000d\u000a        continually emphasised the importance of developing a broad balanced\u000d\u000a        course which develops student's critical thinking'\u000d\u000a    A fellow curriculum designer (C3) and teacher of International Relations\u000d\u000a      in IB schools stated that she had an `invaluable role in, and\u000d\u000a        contribution to, the curriculum development phase' and that `her\u000d\u000a        teaching and research interests in the situating of war\/IR has been\u000d\u000a        evident throughout her participation in this project'. Dr\u000d\u000a      Brocklehurst was the only consultant external to the IB, and the only\u000d\u000a      academic in International Relations during the drafting process. She is\u000d\u000a      now an External Examiner to the IB until 2015. The finalised pilot was\u000d\u000a      first taught in 17 schools worldwide from 2012 and from 2015 the Global\u000d\u000a      Politics Diploma will be available in 3294 schools worldwide and\u000d\u000a      eventually taken by an estimated 20,000 children each year.\u000d\u000a    b) The development of best practice guidance and contribution to\u000d\u000a          Continuing Professional Development on the teaching of sensitive\u000d\u000a          issues in global politics:\u000d\u000a    In her research on children's books Brocklehurst has made clear how the\u000d\u000a      absence of oversight or critical reflection in education sectors is\u000d\u000a      symptomatic of the problematic relationship between children and politics\u000d\u000a      and with International Relations in particular (R2). Her research has\u000d\u000a      greater urgency however in recognising and addressing how sensitive topics\u000d\u000a      such as terrorism can be better resourced for children both inside and\u000d\u000a      outside the formal curriculum.\u000d\u000a    The book archive was critical in allowing UK stakeholders, to see the\u000d\u000a      extent of this challenge. In a workshop, Non-fiction? Children's book,\u000d\u000a        military literacy and the war on terror, held in Swansea in July\u000d\u000a      2011, she effectively challenged the conventional wisdom that educational\u000d\u000a      organisations provide sufficient protection for children in this sensitive\u000d\u000a      area. The workshop provided an opportunity to widen the reach of the\u000d\u000a      research to Subject Associations &#8212; including RE, Citizenship and History\u000d\u000a      and to teachers and librarians. At this event an author of the only review\u000d\u000a      of textbooks in a cognate area &#8212; a government report entitled, Materials\u000d\u000a        used to Teach about World Religions in Schools in England\u000d\u000a      (2010) DCSF-RR197, observed that they had been powerless to expose texts\u000d\u000a      identified as problematic and that their own audit had overlooked books in\u000d\u000a      the archive which covered fundamentalism and extremism. Prior to the\u000d\u000a      workshop the invited UK Publishers Association also shared their concern\u000d\u000a      over less robust `texts'. Stakeholders agreed to raise awareness of the\u000d\u000a      harms associated with poor quality material and address it through\u000d\u000a      training or critical engagement. National organisations such as the School\u000d\u000a      Library Service and History Association committed themselves to increasing\u000d\u000a      reviews of non-fiction and observed that they needed such partnerships to\u000d\u000a      shed light on how they were contributing to children's vulnerability to\u000d\u000a      partial accounts or insensitive offensive narratives and images. The\u000d\u000a      School Library Association Reviews editor (C4) said that the workshop was:\u000d\u000a    `brilliantly informative, raised crucial issues, offered practical\u000d\u000a        developmental possibilities and it was all so well prepared and\u000d\u000a        resourced....Your subject is so important and the potential for creating\u000d\u000a        informed and balanced teaching and educational awareness is a very\u000d\u000a        welcome aspect of research and exploration.....Teachers \/ librarians \/\u000d\u000a        educationalists are indeed very uncertain of how to approach such\u000d\u000a        sensitive and politically charged issues and need, really do need, the\u000d\u000a        confidence of informed advice as well as information on recommended\u000d\u000a        resources'.\u000d\u000a    Brocklehurst has stimulated debate within organisations and created\u000d\u000a      resources to underpin her partnership with them. She provided a Continuing\u000d\u000a      Professional Development (CPD) session on `Military literacy and the\u000d\u000a      challenges of teaching contemporary conflict' at the Historical\u000d\u000a      Association annual conference in 2012. The CPD manager (C5) subsequently\u000d\u000a      solicited her future participation and resources, noting that her `work on\u000d\u000a      terrorism texts has a ready audience and will provoke both thought and\u000d\u000a      action in the classroom'. In response Brocklehurst circulated documents,\u000d\u000a      authored by her, on best practice in teaching and writing on sensitive\u000d\u000a      topics in global politics &#8212; including the military recruitment of children\u000d\u000a      (R3). These provided resources, guidelines and reflective exercises for\u000d\u000a      children and teachers and guidelines for authors and commissioning editors\u000d\u000a      (pre-production). It was anticipated that widespread adoption of guidance\u000d\u000a      in these documents could in time pave the way for creating a jointly\u000d\u000a      authored `code of conduct', endorsed by a number of professional and\u000d\u000a      subject associations.\u000d\u000a    Brocklehurst's claim that these broader relationships need to be engaged\u000d\u000a      with, and bridges built between Politics' professional bodies and\u000d\u000a      educational providers, was endorsed by the National Union of Students in\u000d\u000a      Wales. She was identified as a key thinker in the empowerment of children\u000d\u000a      and was one of four consultants recently invited in June 2013 to\u000d\u000a      contribute to their formulation of strategy. The President (C6) stated: `Helen\u000d\u000a        led a session at one of our `Imagine Education' Commissions; the content\u000d\u000a        was absolutely thought provoking and has influenced our thinking and\u000d\u000a        focus of work.' The book archive was updated up to 2013, and stored\u000d\u000a      as a University Callaghan research centre resource, allowing teachers and\u000d\u000a      educationalists to explore these texts for themselves. This forms the\u000d\u000a      continuing basis for the research to engage multiple stakeholders across\u000d\u000a      the UK to contribute to a better formulation of global politics for\u000d\u000a      children and young people with consequent societal impacts and benefits.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr Brocklehurst's research has provided a challenge to conventional\u000d\u000a      wisdom on the school age teaching of global politics through critiques of\u000d\u000a      approaches that under-estimate children as political bodies. Her research\u000d\u000a      has subsequently influenced a global provider of education, the\u000d\u000a      International Baccaleurate organisation, in the planning of a service,\u000d\u000a      namely a new Global Politics curriculum.

She was the\u000d\u000a      instigator of this research area and since joining Swansea University in\u000d\u000a      June 2001 as an ESRC Research Officer, and subsequently Lecturer in\u000d\u000a      International Relations, she has been credited with establishing a new\u000d\u000a      sub-field in IR and in Security Studies. Her monograph: Who's afraid\u000d\u000a        of children? Children, Conflict and International Relations (R2)\u000d\u000a      argues that concepts of children are premised on a notion of childhood as\u000d\u000a      an experience which has or should have little in common with the political\u000d\u000a      &#8212; and that the discipline of IR has itself exhibited a problematic and\u000d\u000a      unparallelled disengagement with childhood. Such `fear', disruption and\u000d\u000a      denial of a meaningful place for children in the adult-centric study of\u000d\u000a      IR, ultimately masks and distorts children's many roles as complex\u000d\u000a      consumers of international politics. Children apparently protected `from\u000d\u000a      politics' are also potentially denied recognition as `political bodies'\u000d\u000a      and left ill equipped to think critically about the world they are in.\u000d\u000a      Consequently apparently child-friendly societies can side-line children,\u000d\u000a      sending mixed messages about their contribution as future citizens and as\u000d\u000a      spectators, consumers and ultimately stabilisers of war.\u000d\u000a    For over a decade she has commented upon societal and disciplinary\u000d\u000a      challenges to the uncovering of `political children' and childhoods, and\u000d\u000a      explored children's relationship to, and representation within, war (R3).\u000d\u000a      In an age of digitalised and increasingly militarised play and learning,\u000d\u000a      she argues that failure to engage young people (with attendant capacity\u000d\u000a      for reasoning in cognate fields) in the mechanics of IR and the meaning of\u000d\u000a      power, infantilises them (R2) and leaves their potentialities as citizens\u000d\u000a      and persons underdeveloped.\u000d\u000a    From 2001 to 2003, and in 2005, she participated in ESRC-funded research\u000d\u000a      on identity, school textbooks and History in the UK, drawing attention to\u000d\u000a      the challenges of interpreting and evidencing the `national' dimension of\u000d\u000a      school curricula (R1). Since 2008 her research has focused on young\u000d\u000a      consumers of global politics and the production and circulation of\u000d\u000a      literature on war and terrorism intended for juveniles (aged 3 to 18). Her\u000d\u000a      most recent work demonstrates how a weak bridge between the academy of IR\u000d\u000a      and the world of children is particularly problematic in the education\u000d\u000a      sector. Brocklehurst found that a new genre (R4) of `generic' books on\u000d\u000a      war, terrorism, `the war on terror' and extremism were being published and\u000d\u000a      sold to school book sellers, public libraries and purchasable online. This\u000d\u000a      significant body of informational &#8212; albeit often also simplified and\u000d\u000a      sensationalist literature &#8212; attracts virtually no research interest and\u000d\u000a      can pass below the radar of parents, teachers and public bodies in the UK.\u000d\u000a      A pioneering study on extremism and citizenship education in the USA and\u000d\u000a      UK also noted that even (formal) curriculum `textbooks seem on the\u000d\u000a        periphery of developing substantive lesson plans around September 11th'\u000d\u000a      (Geruluk, 2011) - highlighting the risks posed by the significant growth\u000d\u000a      of `trade' texts in the last decade.\u000d\u000a    In 2011 Dr Brocklehurst used University funding and sabbatical leave (G1)\u000d\u000a      in a project, `From citizenship to security: Military literacy and\u000d\u000a        young people', to support the purchase and research of an archive of\u000d\u000a      several hundred children's books on terrorism published after 2001,\u000d\u000a      investigating their narrative and pictorial content, sales and\u000d\u000a      availability. Although some texts were commendable, many were replete with\u000d\u000a      historical and political inaccuracies or simplifications and problematic\u000d\u000a      articulations of the role of religion, Islam and Jihad. Although texts\u000d\u000a      also varied widely in terms of approach and content &#8212; narratives of fear,\u000d\u000a      fatalism, and difference are common &#8212; seemingly drawing on the tradition\u000d\u000a      of `realism' in IR. Contrasting `liberal' or institutional dynamics of\u000d\u000a      global politics are rarely cited (R4) &#8212; an imbalance which fosters\u000d\u000a      children's perception of a hostile and hopeless world. A related major\u000d\u000a      finding was that texts were not subject to any reviews and receive almost\u000d\u000a      no attention &#8212; which is itself typical of effective `militarisation'.\u000d\u000a    In her research Brocklehurst found that librarians and teachers typically\u000d\u000a      select texts without confidence whilst publishers obscure and lower\u000d\u000a      reading ages to generate more sales. Particular texts may be marketed to\u000d\u000a      young boys in response to their literacy needs and children can currently\u000d\u000a      browse such texts independently of adults in many children's libraries.\u000d\u000a      More generally Brocklehurst established that there is little agreement\u000d\u000a      about the place of `war' or politics in the official curriculum and that\u000d\u000a      subject guidance could be poor, for example, weak Wikipedia extracts on\u000d\u000a      terrorism and extremism in a leading award body's (OCR) GCSE Religious\u000d\u000a        Studies Resource Guide.\u000d\u000a    From 2008 her research was presented to five UK and overseas audiences\u000d\u000a      before being submitted for publication in 2010.

The report and the workshop provided the impetus necessary\u000a      for the publication of a pending Kenyan government policy on nomad\u000a      education in 2010, and they continue to frame policy in this area [A].\u000a      Participants at the 2010 workshop discussed and endorsed the EfN\u000a      recommendations that arose from the Kr&#228;tli and Dyer review [4];\u000a      Swift subsequently wrote up the strategy that had been outlined to deliver\u000a      the policy objectives - a fully- costed programme of formal education via\u000a      radio which was projected to reach over 300,000 excluded pastoralist\u000a      children [B].\u000a    The Minister of State for the Development of Northern Kenya and Other\u000a      Arid Lands (MDNKOAL) wrote:\u000a    \"[The University of Leeds'] contribution to the Education for Nomads\u000a      (EfN) initiative had a significant impact on policy approaches in Kenya\u000a      and on expanding the options for service delivery. Until recently, there\u000a      had been insufficient recognition that mobile pastoralists require\u000a      different educational models that do not depend on a system of fixed\u000a      schools. Your research positioned the need for these new approaches within\u000a      the broader context of global best practice. Both the quality of the\u000a      documentation, and your presence at a national workshop on nomadic\u000a      education in January 2010, has helped to reinforce new thinking within the\u000a      Ministry of Education\" [A].\u000a    In 2011, the EfN-initiated work passed for implementation to Kenyan\u000a      ownership. The significance of the EfN work is underlined by its\u000a      presentation by a seniormost Kenyan education official, the Director of\u000a      Human Capital, MDNKOAL, at a 2011 international conference on The Future\u000a      of Pastoralism in Africa, and by the MDNKOAL's affirmation in 2012 that,\u000a      while budgetary constraints had hindered rolling out the strategy: `the\u000a      research had benefits in its own right - for example, in demonstrating to\u000a      the Ministry of Education that these ideas have the backing of serious\u000a      educationalists and therefore can't be lightly dismissed, and in\u000a      highlighting alternatives to the standard boarding school\/mobile school\u000a      option' [C]. The Minister of State for MDNKOAL said he expected the\u000a      strategy of the new (2012) National Council for Nomadic Education to\u000a      continue to draw on the EfN research [A].\u000a    Afghanistan: In July 2012, Dyer gave the keynote address\u000a      at a policy conference where 70 delegates worked on developing\u000a      Afghanistan's national strategy for pastoralists' education. The convening\u000a      agency, the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan (SCA), reported that Dyer's\u000a      analysis of models for pastoralists' education inclusion and policy \/\u000a      implementation challenges from Kenya and India `made a very deep impact on\u000a      the thinking of the participants' [D]. SCA remarks upon Dyer's\u000a      `very outstanding contribution in enhancing the understanding of SCA and\u000a      its partners, about the nomads of Afghanistan, their educational needs and\u000a      how various issues connected with them could be addressed' [D]. The impact\u000a      of the conference and direction Dyer gave to participants is\u000a      reflected in post-conference (2012-13) preparation of a draft policy and\u000a      national guidelines for nomadic education; establishment in 2013 of\u000a      nomadic education as a key strategic priority in SCA's 2014-18 work plan;\u000a      and the SCA education advisor's visiting fellowship at Leeds (3 months in\u000a      2013) [E].\u000a    India: India's pastoralists have considerably lower policy\u000a      visibility than those in Kenya and Afghanistan. Dyer's 1993-1996\u000a      action research (with Archana Choksi, ESRC funded) on models of service\u000a      provision in Gujarat delivered literacy skills to 39 migrating and 25\u000a      semi-sedentary pastoralists of the Rabari caste [1]. This work and\u000a      subsequent research on viable models for provision [1, 4, 5, 6] and on the\u000a      state of existing local provision [2, 3] have played a significant role in\u000a      efforts to improve education for pastoralists in Gujarat. The president of\u000a      the Kutchi Rabari and Bharwad Committee and principal of the LD Rabari\u000a      residential school, write:\u000a    \"Over some 15 years, Dr Dyer has provided us with research\u000a      evidence of how community members understand the role of education in\u000a      their lives [...] that would otherwise not be available to us. [...] Dr Dyer's\u000a      analysis of inadequate state services continues to lend support,\u000a      credibility and encouragement to our claims for official attention to\u000a      these matters, and for state action on ensuring community members' right\u000a      to education\" [E].\u000a    Dyer's research was appended to community petitions to the\u000a      government of Gujurat in 2001 and 2006 calling for recognition of the need\u000a      for appropriate provision [E] and informed the country- specific plan of\u000a      action arising from a Commonwealth Secretariat workshop on Flexible\u000a      Education for Nomadic Populations she facilitated in 2008 [G].\u000a    Dyer's research also shaped changes to provision for pastoralists\u000a      in Gujarat. The committee president quoted above, for instance, said it\u000a      not only changed their view of the importance of education in fighting for\u000a      pastoralist rights but \"challenged us to expand the enrolment\" of girls,\u000a      resulting in new hostel arrangements allowing girls to proceed through\u000a      secondary education [E]. Dyer's attention to pastoralists'\u000a      marginalisation in social service provision and implications for social\u000a      inclusion informed the 2011 India Human Development Report, a major review\u000a      of development in India conducted by the national Government's Planning\u000a      Commission. Dyer was one of nine academic experts invited to\u000a      comment on drafts [F].\u000a    Global policy impact: Collaborators in Kenya, India and\u000a      Afghanistan refer to the value of the international best practice that Dyer's\u000a      research makes available [A, D, E]. This has been the foundation for\u000a      broader impact [G]. Output 4 is a frequently accessed resource, providing\u000a      the authoritative review and analysis of research, policy and outcomes in\u000a      pastoralist education. The Education Adviser to the Social Transformation\u000a      Programmes Division of the Commonwealth Secretariat said: \"Dyer's\u000a      research in Kenya has greatly impacted the work on nomadic education in\u000a      Africa as Kenya and Nigeria have been able to share their experiences as\u000a      good practice for other African countries to replicate. The Commonwealth\u000a      Secretariat has brought together experts from African countries with\u000a      nomadic populations, Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria and Uganda to\u000a      prepare Guidelines for provision of Quality Basic Education to Nomadic\u000a      Populations in Africa.\" [G] Dyer's 2008 edited Commonwealth\u000a      Secretariat publication formed one of the bases of Secretariat work on\u000a      nomadic pastoralists presented to the Commonwealth Ministers of Education\u000a      Conference in 2012. In 2010, the UN's IFAD convened the first Global\u000a      Gathering for Women Pastoralists, attended by representatives of 31\u000a      countries, and the women's strong claim for appropriate, accessible\u000a      education provision, a key theme of Dyer's research, was captured\u000a      in an account Dyer contributed for the 2011 document IFAD\u000a      developed for inter-agency policy advocacy [H].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The global pledge of achieving Education For All by 2015 is compromised\u000a      by providers' reliance on education services that are designed for\u000a      sedentary users and exclude nomadic pastoralists. Dr Caroline Dyer\u000a      (University of Leeds; Senior Lecturer in Development Practice, 2004-2011;\u000a      Reader in Education in Development, 2011- present) has re-visioned\u000a      approaches to education for nomadic groups through her analysis of how\u000a      public policy perpetuates pastoralists' educational marginalisation and\u000a      design of research-based models of service provision that can deliver\u000a      pastoralists' right to education inclusion without compromising their\u000a      mobile livelihoods. Her research led to changes in national policy\u000a      strategy and re-designed service delivery in Kenya in 2010, shaped policy\u000a      debate in Afghanistan from 2012, and has supported community and NGO\u000a      advocacy in India since 2008.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    POLIS, University of Leed\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Leeds (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Leeds","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007795}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1270770","Name":"State of Gujarat"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Dyer's research combines\u000a      social exclusion and sustainable livelihoods perspectives to critique\u000a      extensive reliance on formal, fixed-place schooling as the dominant model\u000a      of service delivery. This model undermines the EFA promise by imposing\u000a      unjust and unachievable terms of education inclusion on pastoralist\u000a      families, whose livelihood depends on mobility and situated learning. Dyer\u000a      shows that EFA has perpetuated rather than challenged pastoralists'\u000a      education marginalisation by expanding inappropriate state services,\u000a      sporadically supplemented by compensatory, low status alternatives. She\u000a      has researched pastoralists' unmet demand for services and identified\u000a      exclusionary aspects of current provision. She has also generated\u000a      alternative models of service provision that are sufficiently flexible in\u000a      time and space to offer pastoralists opportunities for education inclusion\u000a      that do not compromise their mobile livelihoods.\u000a    The link between pastoralist livelihoods and education was initially\u000a      researched in Gujarat, Western India, where Dyer and Choksi's\u000a      ESRC-funded work trialled a model of mobile literacy provision for\u000a      pastoralists in the 1990s [1, 3]. Nuffield-funded research in 2009\u000a      investigated Gujarat state's policy narratives of modernity and Education\u000a      For All, and how pastoralists were affected by post-2001 earthquake\u000a      reconstruction. It found intensified livelihood stress had stimulated\u000a      sedentarisation and an escalating demand for education, despite the risk\u000a      of inclusion in the market economy on very unequal terms [2]. It also\u000a      showed that pastoralists who remain mobile continue to be denied provision\u000a      that assures their right to education despite India's 2009 Right To\u000a      Education Act [2].\u000a    Dyer's critique of pastoralists' education marginalisation led to\u000a      an invitation to engage with policy debates in Kenya. In 2009, she was\u000a      invited to join the Education For Nomads (EfN) team (Dyer, Sue\u000a      Cavanna, Ced Hesse, Saverio Kr&#228;tli, Jeremy Swift) as the education\u000a      specialist. EfN worked out of the International Institute of Environment\u000a      and Drylands (IIED) in London and brought together the expertise of\u000a      Kr&#228;tli, Hesse and Swift, as pastoralist\/dryland specialists in livelihood\u000a      systems, with Cavanna's experience in non-profit organisation support for\u000a      pastoralists in Kenya. Dyer brought education expertise and a\u000a      practical and theoretical understanding of pastoralist education. Dyer\u000a      worked with Kr&#228;tli in identifying research-led strategic policy options\u000a      for Kenya, providing a literature review and critique of current provision\u000a      [4] to suggest how the `mainstream' approach can be expanded, particularly\u000a      by adoption of a radio-based model that offers education inclusion without\u000a      compromising pastoralist mobility.\u000a    Evidence of nomadic groups' educational exclusion is scant. Dyer's\u000a      edited collection of international case studies [1] is a key resource,\u000a      cited in the 2010 Unesco EFA Global Monitoring Report `Reaching the\u000a      Marginalised'. Two keynote addresses have informed debate among policy \/\u000a      practitioner communities: i) in 2008 to a South Asia regional workshop\u000a      convened by the Commonwealth Secretariat; ii) in 2012 in Afghanistan to a\u000a      national workshop on policy options for education inclusion of over one\u000a      million Afghan pastoralists. The importance of Dyer's critique of\u000a      EFA is further underlined by the British Association for International and\u000a      Comparative Education's invitation to give the plenary keynote to its 2012\u000a      conference on `Education, Mobility and Migration' [5]; and her editorship\u000a      of a 2012 Compare Special Issue `Developing Education, Challenging\u000a      Marginalisation', featuring research by a group of practitioners and\u000a      academics who formed to critique the 2010 EFA Global Monitoring Report\u000a      [2].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6405","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research has shaped policy debate and outcomes relating to the\u000d\u000a      Southern Thai conflict from\u000d\u000a      2008 to the present.\u000d\u000a    i) Policy-makers\u000d\u000a    Since the publication of key research in 2008, previously `unthinkable'\u000d\u000a      ideas of autonomy for\u000d\u000a      Thailand's southern border provinces have become increasingly\u000d\u000a      mainstreamed.

[B].\u000d\u000a    The research has also been used by a range of state actors including the\u000d\u000a      Royal Thai Police, whose\u000d\u000a      national chief writes: `I have asked Professor McCargo to serve as an\u000d\u000a      informal advisor to the Royal\u000d\u000a      Thai Police with respect to our handling of issues in the deep South' [C].\u000d\u000a      Similarly, the UN Chief in\u000d\u000a      Thailand, writes: `McCargo's research has fed into our understanding of\u000d\u000a      the Southern Thai conflict\u000d\u000a      and the way in which we have framed our responses and policies\u000d\u000a      accordingly... his conclusions\u000d\u000a      have helped us in shaping our collaborations with the Royal Thai\u000d\u000a      Government' [D].\u000d\u000a    ii) NGOs\u000d\u000a    The research has also inspired further policy-based work on the South,\u000d\u000a      including initiatives to\u000d\u000a      support local journalists and civil society groups by Japan's influential\u000d\u000a      Sasakawa Peace\u000d\u000a      Foundation (SPF), which has used McCargo's research as a `handbook' for\u000d\u000a      determining its\u000d\u000a      interpretation of the conflict and moves to develop political solutions\u000d\u000a      [E]. The Foundation Director\u000d\u000a      writes, `It is no exaggeration to say that SPF's various projects in the\u000d\u000a      Deep South region have been\u000d\u000a      guided by Professor McCargo's work in many respects'[H]. The Foundation's\u000d\u000a      application of the\u000d\u000a      research to support projects such as journalism training illustrates the\u000d\u000a      reach of impact well beyond\u000d\u000a      Thailand itself.\u000d\u000a    iii) Framing the public debate\u000d\u000a    Coverage of the research has helped formulate an emerging international\u000d\u000a      consensus that the\u000d\u000a      conflict in southern Thailand is a political problem, for which autonomy\u000d\u000a      or some comparable\u000d\u000a      decentralisation of power is the obvious solution. An ESRC evaluation\u000d\u000a      report concluded that the\u000d\u000a      research had \"been carried directly to the heart of the global community\u000d\u000a      studying, working on and\u000d\u000a      fighting insurgencies.\" [F]. The research has also served to discredit\u000d\u000a      alternative arguments that the\u000d\u000a      conflict arises primarily from local mafia feuds, the drug trade and\u000d\u000a      smuggling. This has increased\u000d\u000a      pressure on the Thai authorities to modify policies in the south and\u000d\u000a      engage with peace dialogues\u000d\u000a      and other initiatives. Media coverage of research-based\u000d\u000a      arguments&#8212;including an op-ed in the\u000d\u000a      Guardian Weekly and a Thai Public Broadcasting Service TV\u000d\u000a      interview&#8212;has boosted their impact.\u000d\u000a    The high profile and international reach of the research has made its\u000d\u000a      interpretations more difficult\u000d\u000a      to sideline and has helped open up greater debate within Thailand.\u000d\u000a      According to a second ESRC\u000d\u000a      evaluation: `The researcher has also had an impact on public discussion of\u000d\u000a      the violence in Thai\u000d\u000a      South in the international media, which in turn has an influence on\u000d\u000a      policy-making [G].'\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Duncan McCargo at the University of Leeds has changed\u000d\u000a      the way in which domestic\u000d\u000a      and international policymakers, NGOs, the media and the Thai public have\u000d\u000a      understood and\u000d\u000a      engaged with the ongoing insurgency in southern Thailand.

It was initially based on a\u000d\u000a      DFID\/British Council\u000d\u000a      Higher Education Link with Prince of Songkla University (PSU) Pattani\u000d\u000a      (2002-6), which involved\u000d\u000a      McCargo as Link Co-ordinator working with a group of Leeds and Thai\u000d\u000a      colleagues. McCargo\u000d\u000a      conducted one year's fieldwork in Pattani, a major town in the far south\u000d\u000a      of Thailand, between 2005\u000d\u000a      and 2006, conducting 270 formal interviews and numerous informal\u000d\u000a      observations of political\u000d\u000a      leaders, security personnel, activists, religious leaders, and other\u000d\u000a      members of the local community.\u000d\u000a    McCargo's was the first study of the conflict based on extensive original\u000d\u000a      fieldwork and contradicted\u000d\u000a      previous scholarship that characterised the ongoing insurgency in\u000d\u000a      Thailand's southern border\u000d\u000a      provinces &#8212; which has claimed over 5,500 lives since 2004 &#8212; as driven by\u000d\u000a      Al-Qaeda-linked\u000d\u000a      Islamists and fuelled by crime and socio-economic grievances [1]. The\u000d\u000a      research set out to\u000d\u000a      interrogate these arguments. Published outputs challenged and contradicted\u000d\u000a      both the centrality of\u000d\u000a      `Islamist' underpinnings and socio-economic factors, arguing instead that\u000d\u000a      the insurgency had\u000d\u000a      political roots [2] in the incomplete incorporation of the Patani region\u000d\u000a      into the Thai state. It\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that, while the Thai state's earlier attempts to manage the\u000d\u000a      conflict had enjoyed initial\u000d\u000a      successes, the policy had gradually unravelled [3]. The divide-and-rule\u000d\u000a      tactics of Bangkok\u000d\u000a      progressively weakened political and civil society in the region.\u000d\u000a    The research interpreted the conflict as a crisis of legitimacy for the\u000d\u000a      Thai state, reflecting the\u000d\u000a      declining authority of Thailand's ageing king and national-level political\u000d\u000a      tensions following the\u000d\u000a      election of Thaksin Shinawatra to the premiership in 2001 [2]. The\u000d\u000a      conflict has exacerbated ethnic\u000d\u000a      and religious tensions through the rise of Buddhist chauvinism and a\u000d\u000a      parallel backlash from\u000d\u000a      elements of the Muslim community [3].\u000d\u000a    The research demonstrated that the legitimacy deficit was compounded by\u000d\u000a      inept and sometimes\u000d\u000a      abusive actions by the Thai security forces, especially during the Krue Ze\u000d\u000a      and Tak Bai incidents in\u000d\u000a      2004. Heavy-handed blunders by the military created propaganda victories\u000d\u000a      that helped a resurgent\u000d\u000a      militant movement to thrive [2]. The nature of the militant movement &#8212; a\u000d\u000a      loose network based on\u000d\u000a      small village-level cells &#8212; proved extremely difficult for the Thai\u000d\u000a      military, trained in conventional\u000d\u000a      warfare, to counter effectively. Militants themselves were mainly young\u000d\u000a      men aged 18-25, motivated\u000d\u000a      by a strong belief that Malay Muslims had been exploited and abused by the\u000d\u000a      Thai state and its\u000d\u000a      local allies and agents over a long period.\u000d\u000a    Based on this analysis of the conflict as a political problem, a range of\u000d\u000a      potential political solutions\u000d\u000a      were proposed by the author. These included alternative forms of autonomy,\u000d\u000a      decentralisation and\u000d\u000a      regionalisation [4]. Administrative reforms such as the possible creation\u000d\u000a      of a special ministry for the\u000d\u000a      South were investigated [5].\u000d\u000a    Findings have been conveyed in briefings to key beneficiaries on three\u000d\u000a      continents, including the\u000d\u000a      FCO (December 2008, July 2010, July 2011), Cabinet Office (May 2011), UK\u000d\u000a      (June 2011) and US\u000d\u000a      (November 2010) Ambassadors to Thailand, State Department (March 2008,\u000d\u000a      November 2010, May\u000d\u000a      2013), UN (March and December 2009, May 2010, April 2011, October 2012,\u000d\u000a      December 2012),\u000d\u000a      Thai Senate President (January 2009), EU officials (June 2011), Norwegian\u000d\u000a      Foreign Ministry\u000d\u000a      (November 2011) and Japanese parliamentarians (October 2012).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7314","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    \u000a      In order for the above research to achieve maximum impact, key\u000a        findings, ideas and recommendations were `road-tested' via a range of\u000a        potential beneficiaries and stakeholders, such as the British Youth\u000a        Council, the Prince's Trust, the Hansard Society and the UK Youth\u000a        Parliament, to formulate how practical and workable policies could be\u000a        developed to reflect the thrust of the research. These stakeholders thus\u000a        met with Tonge to discuss the research and prospective policy\u000a        outworking. These groups were also involved in dissemination of the\u000a        research into the public domain, mainly via websites and forums (e.g.\u000a        the Hansard Society ran a `Heads Up' interactive discussion blog in\u000a        2009-10, to which Tonge regularly contributed) and helped promote some\u000a        of the findings to influence adoption by the government. Other processes\u000a        of dissemination included promotion and discussion of the research and\u000a        outworking at public events, ranging from ESRC Festivals of Social\u000a        Science (2008, Sheffield, 2012 Birmingham); via the chairing of local\u000a        youth councils, e.g. Bridgend's in 2009); and via television and radio\u000a        programmes (e.g. `Tell it Like it Is' and `Dragon's Eye' on BBC Wales,\u000a        2009, with the research findings also featured on BBC Radio 4's\u000a        Westminster Hour in 2013).\u000a      Research findings have been presented directly to government\u000a        ministers; Tonge was invited to present research and recommendations to\u000a        the Prime Minister, the Cabinet Office and to the government's\u000a        Democratic Renewal Council of senior ministers. Research findings on the\u000a        value of citizenship education were sent directly to the Education\u000a        Minister, Michael Gove, in 2012 and the government reversed its initial\u000a        intention to abolish citizenship education from the school curriculum.\u000a        Tonge also presented his research to Dail Eireann (the Irish Parliament)\u000a        and at the National Assembly for Wales. Young people responded to the\u000a        research in a series of interactive discussions with Tonge in the\u000a        Hansard Society's Heads Up Forum.\u000a    \u000a    The research has had the following impacts, benefitting stakeholders and\u000a      young people, evidenced in the written testimonials provided from\u000a        government ministers which show how recommendations arising from the\u000a      research have been put directly into effect.\u000a    A dedicated Minister for Youth Citizens and Youth Engagement was\u000a      established in October 2010 to bolster youth civil and civic engagement\u000a      and to coordinate youth engagement initiatives, which the research\u000a      highlighted as hitherto too piecemeal and uncoordinated.\u000a    A youth online hub was created by the government in 2010,\u000a      allowing young people to access information concerning citizenship\u000a      opportunities and funding for youth engagement projects and informational\u000a      networks, such as the Ministry of Justice's Youth Network programme.\u000a    The Children Schools and Families Bill 2011 placed statutory\u000a        responsibilities upon schools to give pupils `voice', in line with\u000a      research recommendations.\u000a    The research highlighted that young people were knowledge-deficient in\u000a      terms of how to interact with local authorities. Consequently, the\u000a      government placed a statutory duty upon local authorities to consider\u000a        permanent arrangements for consultations with local populations on\u000a      the delivery of services, reflective of all ages, to include\u000a      permanent advisory and scrutiny panels.\u000a    The research made a very clear case for the retention of citizenship\u000a        education and for improvements in the consistency and effectiveness\u000a      of its delivery. It demonstrated the gains evident in terms of civic\u000a      engagement, literacy and knowledge of how decisions are made at local and\u000a      national levels from citizenship classes. Significantly, the\u000a        Conservatives moved from a position of opposition to citizenship\u000a        education prior to taking office in 2010 to one of retention as the\u000a      subject was clearly shown to be of considerable value in bolstering\u000a      citizen engagement, as shown in the Citizenship\u000a        Foundation report February 2013.\u000a    The research did not advocate a lowering of the voting age for\u000a      Westminster elections and the current government has cited its evidence in\u000a      this respect (Hansard\u000a        col 523, 24\/01\/13). It argued that there was no case in this respect\u000a      and that public opinion could not act as a clear guide, as the research\u000a      demonstrated that those aged 18+ strongly opposed change whilst those\u000a      younger were (marginally) in favour of change. The research highlighted\u000a      the considerable variation in terms of ages of responsibility. It did\u000a      suggest that the age of franchise in devolved nations could be determined\u000a      by the governments of those nations, a feature accepted by the SNP (which\u000a      commented on the research) in government. The research suggested that\u000a      ensuring that young people are registered to vote is a bigger\u000a      priority than examination of the voting age and government\/Electoral\u000a      Commission advertising campaigns have reflected this.\u000a    A pilot programme of civic service, National Citizen Service, has been\u000a      introduced, on a voluntary basis. The research, whilst supportive of the\u000a      idea in principle based upon existing national and international\u000a      comparative evidence (USA and Germany), highlighted the difficulties of\u000a      introducing compulsory schemes (cost issues), privately-run programmes\u000a      (motive issues) and also stressed the need for clear definition of the\u000a      purpose of such schemes. Volunteering opportunities have been expanded\u000a      under the previous and current governments and the expectation is that\u000a      citizen service, if pilots are successful, will be expanded.\u000a    Overall, the significance of the research has been to shift governmental\u000a      agendas towards a much clearer and far more focused approach towards youth\u000a      civil and civic engagement. Prior to the research, there were fewer\u000a      opportunities for volunteering and no national programme, no statutory\u000a      engagement with young people at local level, no dedicated minister for\u000a      young people, and a focus on voting age, rather than young voter\u000a      registration and engagement with the political process. All of this has\u000a      changed, whilst citizenship education has been retained, as the research\u000a      advised.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study refers to the research\/publications of Tonge on youth\u000a      civic engagement since 2007, which dovetailed with his government\u000a      appointment as Chair of the Youth Citizenship Commission (YCC) in 2008-9.\u000a      The research agenda examined what citizenship means to young people;\u000a      considered how to increase young people's participation in politics;\u000a      assessed how citizenship can be promoted through community and political\u000a      engagement and led a consultation with young people on whether the voting\u000a      age should be lowered to 16.

The research involved extensive qualitative\u000a      interviews with young people and groups attempting to promote youth\u000a      political engagement and volunteering and quantitative (n2200+) survey\u000a      attitudinal analysis.\u000a    The research insights and findings from the quantitative and qualitative\u000a      analyses undertaken between 2007-10 can be summarised as follows:\u000a    \u000a      There was acknowledgement amongst young people themselves of\u000a        non-engagement in formal political activity, reflected in, e.g. only a\u000a        minority of 18-24 years olds voting in elections since 1997, but that\u000a        this should not be construed as apathy.\u000a      Social class was a significant variable in levels of youth political\u000a        engagement.\u000a      Young people's perceptions of what constituted good citizenship did\u000a        not normally include political activity, such as voting. Instead,\u000a        obedience to the law or apolitical volunteering were seen as good\u000a        citizenship, not political engagement. The research highlighted the need\u000a        to empower citizenship and develop it to include political activity.\u000a      The barriers which exist to the development of youth political\u000a        engagement are social, institutional and knowledge-deficit based.\u000a      There is a particularly low level of knowledge amongst young people of\u000a        local government.\u000a      Most innovations to bolster political engagement have previously been\u000a        technocratic (e.g. experiments with voting methods) - an approach\u000a        rejected by young people who are sceptical of experiments such as text\u000a        voting and insufficiently ideological.\u000a      The research found that citizenship education does improve civic\u000a        engagement and political capacity. Young people respond positively on a\u000a        range of indicators, provided it is properly taught. The research\u000a        discovered that citizenship education has been uneven in delivery and\u000a        content, ranging from excellent to unsatisfactory, since becoming a\u000a        statutory part of the English curriculum (and taught under other titles\u000a        elsewhere in the UK). Crucially however, the research found that,\u000a        controlling for demographic and social class variables, properly\u000a        delivered citizenship education does have a beneficial impact in terms\u000a        of political knowledge and engagement, offering a clear rationale for\u000a        its continuation within the school syllabus. A positive independent\u000a        effect was yielded by citizenship education in terms of knowledge,\u000a        propensity to volunteer and likelihood of voting.\u000a      Young people (16-17 year olds) are almost evenly divided on whether\u000a        the voting age should be lowered and the issue is not seen as a priority\u000a        by many. A majority of 18-25 year olds were opposed to any lowering.\u000a        Most 16-17 year olds opposed to a lowering felt they had insufficient\u000a        knowledge to vote.\u000a      Non-registration of young voters - as high as 28 per cent of those due\u000a        on the electoral register- is an acute problem which needs to be tackled\u000a        via registration in schools\/colleges.\u000a      A programme of National Citizen Service for young people as a means of\u000a        boosting civic engagement could have utility, provided that it avoided\u000a        errors highlighted in the comparative examples studied in the research\u000a        e.g. the privatised `poor corps' United States model and the compulsion\u000a        and indeterminate ambitions of the German model of civic service. The\u000a        research highlighted the need for any such programme to move beyond\u000a        civil volunteering to also adopt civic, i.e. political, knowledge\u000a        acquisition or engagement.\u000a    \u000a    Overall, the research found that where there was a lack of civil and\u000a      civic engagement among young people it was often caused not by apathy but\u000a      by a lack of information or opportunity. This tended to lead to engagement\u000a      amongst young people being largely confined to immediate social spheres of\u000a      family and friends and not extending to institutions and political actors.\u000a      The research found a lack of prioritisation of young people's civic needs\u000a      amongst policy-makers, leading to the absence of holistic programmes of\u000a      reform designed to boost civic engagement. Policy-makers needed to develop\u000a      new methods of engaging with young people to connect better and to\u000a      re-orientate institutions to be capable of adapting to the desires of\u000a      young people, otherwise youth civic non- engagement could worsen.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7322","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Discovery: Research conducted by Dr Balch into the UK government\u000d\u000a      response to human trafficking and forced labour found gaps and weaknesses\u000d\u000a      in the UK's legislation in this area and in its system of regulation and\u000d\u000a      enforcement (Balch 2012).

The research found\u000d\u000a      inconsistencies in the legislative framework around human trafficking and\u000d\u000a      forced labour, and also gaps and weaknesses in the system of regulation\u000d\u000a      and enforcement, exacerbated by (among other things) low awareness of the\u000d\u000a      issue in some parts of the police, organisational problems leading to poor\u000d\u000a      implementation, loss of key personnel and expertise due to organisational\u000d\u000a      change, and poor communication between agencies.

The\u000d      ESRC project ran from September 2009 to January 2011 and sought to explore\u000d      how ordinary people think about counter-terrorism policy. Specifically, it\u000d      explored how counter-terrorist measures impact on perceptions or\u000d      experiences of security and citizenship within the UK, and the\u000d      significance of geographical residence and ethnicity as explanatory\u000d      factors within this. The project undertook 15 focus groups in different\u000d      parts of the UK, to access in-depth, qualitatively rich attitudes of\u000d      specific communities and groups. The impact of the research was achieved\u000d      during the writing up of the research.\u000d    A first major finding was around attitudes to anti-terrorism measures. A\u000d    range of discourses sceptical of anti-terrorism measures were identified,\u000d    including fears of their misuse, civil liberties concerns, views of their\u000d    ineffectiveness and also concerns about creating a climate of fear. Positive\u000d    views were also encountered, including satisfaction that government was\u000d    \"doing something\", an understanding of the need for such measures, and a\u000d    view that sufficient safeguards to protect liberties were in place. Whilst\u000d    differences between ethnic groups in terms of attitudes toward\u000d    anti-terrorism policies are slight (in terms of support for such policies or\u000d    otherwise), there are pronounced differences in the impact of such measures\u000d    (perceived and experienced) upon distinct citizens and communities. A common\u000d    concern highlighted that anti-terrorism measures have impacted\u000d    disproportionately on rights, responsibilities and the opportunities for\u000d    social\/political participation amongst communities, with white individuals\u000d    less targeted than non-white individuals. Thus, a key finding was that\u000d    ethnic minority citizens more broadly, and not just Muslim or those of South\u000d    Asian background, felt targeted. This raises the possibility that\u000d    anti-terrorism measures may exacerbate issues and problems around\u000d    citizenship by negatively affecting the citizenship of minority communities.\u000d    Such differences point to genuine concerns surrounding the universality of\u000d    citizenship within the UK, and the rights, responsibilities and\u000d    opportunities for political participation associated with this status (see\u000d    Jarvis &amp; Lister, 2012).\u000d    A second key finding within this research was that security is understood\u000d      in a broad and varied fashion across the United Kingdom. Six dominant and\u000d      discrete security imaginaries were articulated to Jarvis and Lister by\u000d      members of the public within their focus groups. These linked the concept\u000d      of security to survival, contentment, hospitality, equality, freedom and\u000d      insecurity respectively (see Jarvis &amp; Lister, 2013).\u000d    A third aspect of the research is an analysis of the ways in which\u000d      contemporary anti-terrorism measures seek to deploy and make use of\u000d      citizens as tools of anti-terrorism. Contemporary initiatives are heavily\u000d      reliant on the continued participation of citizens for their functioning;\u000d      a reliance persistently justified by claims to uncertainty, even\u000d      ignorance, among political elites. This \"stakeholder security\" leads to\u000d      the conscription of ordinary individuals into the state's security\u000d      apparatuses, a conscription that positions citizens precariously as\u000d      simultaneously technologies, subjects and objects of security.

Professor\u000a      Caney's research has\u000a      made a significant contribution to this development. His application of\u000a      ethical frames &#8212; such as\u000a      human rights thresholds and intergenerational justice &#8212; to climate change\u000a      policy is now used by\u000a      major actors in the climate change field ranging from international\u000a      organisations, to governments\u000a      and NGOs.\u000a    Caney was an Advisor to the International Council on Human Rights\u000a        Policy (ICHRP) &#8212; an\u000a      independent policy body &#8212; on the inclusion of human rights concerns in\u000a      their 2008 report Climate\u000a        Change and Human Rights.

This was one of the first policy reports to clarify how human\u000a      rights can be considered as an\u000a      essential dimension of climate change policy. It had a powerful framing\u000a      effect on the wider debate\u000a      and shaped the policy positions of major actors such as the UN &#8212; the Human\u000a      Rights Council and\u000a      the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (see below)[C2].\u000a    (1) Shaping the adoption of human rights and equity concerns as\u000a          legitimate considerations\u000a          in guiding and targeting climate change policy\u000a    Caney's research has informed the positions adopted by a range of UN\u000a      bodies, the World Bank\u000a      and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) on human rights and\u000a      climate change.\u000a    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): Caney's work has\u000a      contributed to the explicit\u000a      concern for human rights and equity reflected in the latest Assessment\u000a      Report (AR5) issued by the\u000a      Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC works\u000a      under the auspices of the\u000a      United Nations and is the leading intergovernmental scientific body for\u000a      the assessment of climate\u000a      change. It provides rigorous scientific information on climate change and\u000a      its potential\u000a      environmental and socio-economic impacts to decision makers. Its reports\u000a      are the authoritative\u000a      source of information in international climate change negotiations and\u000a      have a critical impact on\u000a      policy responses. Caney was a member of the working group that drafted the\u000a      report's chapter on\u000a      `Social, Economic and Ethical Concepts and Methods'. Other chapters on\u000a      `Impacts, Adaptation and\u000a      Vulnerability' and `Mitigation of Climate Change' also cite his research [R1,\u000a        R3, R5, R7]. In all,\u000a      Caney's arguments that climate change has substantial effects on human\u000a      rights, intergenerational\u000a      justice and distributive justice are cited in six chapters of the report.\u000a      The IPCC's fifth assessment\u000a      report will shape worldwide responses to climate change from 2014 onwards.\u000a    United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\u000a      (OHCHR): Caney's research\u000a      and the ICHRP report in turn shaped the thinking of the OHCHR on the\u000a      relationship between\u000a      climate change and human rights. Both Caney's work [R1] and the\u000a      ICHRP report are cited in\u000a      OHCHR's analysis [C3]. The OHCHR report refers to Caney's argument\u000a      that a moral concern for\u000a      intergenerational justice imposes a duty on current generations to\u000a      mitigate climate change in order\u000a      to safeguard the rights of future generations.\u000a    UNICEF: Caney's work on intergenerational justice has shaped\u000a      UNICEF's position on climate\u000a      change. Following Caney, UNICEF argues in its report `A brighter tomorrow:\u000a      climate change, child\u000a      rights and intergenerational justice' that the rights of future\u000a      generations must be a key\u000a      consideration in policy making on climate change and cites Caney's work [R1,R4]\u000a        [C4].\u000a    The World Bank: Caney's work has also influenced the World Bank\u000a      Group's approach to climate\u000a      policy. Caney contributed a commissioned background paper on `Ethics and\u000a      Climate Change 2009'\u000a      to the Bank's World Development Report 2010 which included the\u000a      argument (referencing Caney)\u000a      that climate change policies should take account of fairness in the\u000a      distribution of responsibilities\u000a      and costs, human rights, and intergenerational equity [R1-4] [C5].\u000a      The report sets the framework\u000a      for the Bank's climate change policy.\u000a    International Trade Union Congress (ITUC): Caney's research [R5]\u000a      and contributions to an ITUC\u000a      seminar on climate change had considerable influence in shaping the ITUC's\u000a      view of climate\u000a      change as jeopardizing not just labour but also human rights. The ITUC\u000a      represents 174 million\u000a      workers in 156 countries and its call for climate change policies that\u000a      protect both sets of rights is\u000a      enshrined in the ITUC report `Making Common Cause: Human Rights, Labour\u000a      Rights and Climate\u000a      Change' [C6], which formed the basis for the ITUC's contributions\u000a      to the UN climate change\u000a      negotiations in Canc&#250;n\u000a      (2010) and Doha (2012).\u000a    (2) Shaping policy: biofuels, human rights and the equitable\u000a          allocation of burdens\u000a    The research on normative principles to guide climate change policy [R5,\u000a        R6] has been particularly\u000a      influential in shaping policy initiatives with respect to biofuels. As a\u000a      result of his work Caney was\u000a      invited to join the working party on biofuels of the Nuffield Council\u000a        on Bioethics and had a central\u000a      influence in developing the six ethical principles advocated by the\u000a      Council as a guide for biofuels\u000a      policy [C7]. The principles &#8212; which include respect for people's\u000a      essential rights and the equitable\u000a      distribution of benefits and costs from biofuels policies &#8212; were published\u000a      in the Council's report\u000a      Biofuels: Ethical Issues (2011) of which Caney is a co-author.\u000a      These principles have shaped the\u000a      frameworks applied to biofuels policy in the UK and at the European level.\u000a    \u000a      The principles influenced the criteria applied in the first voluntary\u000a        schemes to certify the\u000a        sustainability of biofuels approved by the European Commission [C7].\u000a\u000a      The UK Bioenergy Strategy, published by the government in\u000a        April 2012, reflected the Nuffield\u000a        Council's six ethical principles [C7], and the Chair of the House\u000a          of Commons Energy and\u000a          Climate Change Select Committee (Tim Yeo MP) endorsed the report's\u000a        six principles as\u000a        \"completely beyond argument\", [C8].\u000a      In October 2012, the UK's Technology Strategy Board employed\u000a        the six principles in its\u000a        `Responsible Innovation Framework' to guide innovation in the area of\u000a        synthetic biology.\u000a    \u000a    In all, the six principles have been among the most influential outputs\u000a      of the Nuffield Council. Since\u000a      publication, the main page for the report (www.nuffieldbioethics.org\/biofuels)\u000a      has been viewed\u000a      more than 25,000 times and the report PDF has been downloaded 2,700 times.\u000a    (3) Shaping the public debate about climate change\u000a    The research has generated wide public interest: Caney was invited to\u000a      speak on how principles of\u000a      justice and human rights should inform climate change policy by UNESCO,\u000a      Policy Network, the\u000a      Danish Institute for Human Rights, the Centre for Sustainable Energy, the\u000a      E3 Foundation, and in\u000a      the Oxford Amnesty Lectures. His work was recommended by Mary Robinson in\u000a      her 5 essential\u000a      readings on climate justice [R5, C9]. His proposals for\u000a      safeguarding the rights of future generations\u000a      in democratic political processes that address climate change were quoted\u000a      by the Rt Hon Ed\u000a      Miliband (then Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change) in his\u000a      speech `The Road to\u000a      Copenhagen' at the LSE on 17 November 2009 [C10].\u000a    In sum, by demonstrating the effects of climate change on human rights\u000a      and equity, and charting\u000a      how these concerns can be considered in policy, Caney's research has had\u000a      important impact in\u000a      framing ethical considerations in the debate about climate change\u000a      policies. The work has had\u000a      significant reach enabling major stakeholders from UN bodies, the World\u000a      Bank and the ITUC to the\u000a      European Commission and the UK government to formulate positions that take\u000a      account of the\u000a      ethical issues raised by climate change and to develop policy frameworks\u000a      that address them.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Caney's research addresses a fundamental concern that climate\u000a      policies should be\u000a      guided not just by economic considerations but also by ethical\u000a      considerations. His research on\u000a      human rights and intergenerational justice identifies ethical principles\u000a      to guide climate change\u000a      policy that have influenced major actors in the climate change field\u000a      ranging from international\u000a      organisations to governments and NGOs.

The response to climate change has conventionally been seen as an\u000a      economic issue and\u000a      has been evaluated using cost-benefit analysis. There has, however, been\u000a      growing concern\u000a      among international institutions, governments and NGOs that a purely\u000a      economic approach is\u000a      insufficient and needs to be complemented by ethical principles. Caney's\u000a      research meets that\u000a      concern. It formulates ethical thresholds to provide policy-relevant\u000a      guidance in a range of non-ideal\u000a      scenarios.\u000a    (a) Human rights, intergenerational justice and the ethics of\u000a          climate change policies\u000a    A central argument of Caney's research is that climate change is unjust\u000a      because it jeopardizes\u000a      core `human rights thresholds' &#8212; such as rights to life, health, food and\u000a      water [Section 3: R5, R6].\u000a      In a related argument, the research defends an account of\u000a      intergenerational justice and proposes\u000a      that it is unjust to discount the rights of future generations [R1,\u000a        R2]. The ethical principle flowing\u000a      from this work is that climate policies should aim to reduce the prospect\u000a      of climate change that\u000a      jeopardizes present and future generations' rights to life, health, food\u000a      and water.\u000a    In his research Caney offers a methodological critique of the\u000a      conventional ways in which the\u000a      distribution of emissions has been treated in theory and practice\u000a      (including in emissions trading\u000a      schemes). He proposes an alternative approach centred on respecting and\u000a      sustaining people's\u000a      higher-order interests, arguing that it is wrong to isolate climate change\u000a      from other serious moral\u000a      concerns (such as human rights, poverty and health). The work advances an\u000a      integrated approach\u000a      that treats emission rights in conjunction with these broader normative\u000a      concerns [R7, R4].\u000a    (b) Allocating the burdens of combating climate change\u000a    Caney's work also engages with the question of how the burdens of\u000a      combating climate change\u000a      should be distributed. He argues that they should be carried by those who\u000a      are most responsible for\u000a      causing the change and those with the greatest ability to pay. The\u000a      research advances a distinctive\u000a      combination of two principles of justice, the Polluter Pays Principle\u000a      and an Ability to Pay Principle\u000a      [R3]. Caney integrates these principles into a broader ethical\u000a      framework to guide climate policies\u000a      and argues that the Polluter Pays Principle should not be applied\u000a      in ways which compromise\u000a      human rights and that it ought to take into account people's ability to\u000a      pay [R4, R5].\u000a    Caney's work applies the ethical principles he derives to a range of\u000a      substantive policy areas\u000a      including biofuels, emissions trading schemes, and clean technologies [R1 - R7].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11430","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Welsh's research on the responsibility of states and international\u000a      organisations to protect populations from mass atrocity crimes has had a\u000a      significant impact on the policy of the UN and its member states and on\u000a      expertise and capacity building within the wider R2P policy community.

Her work on the\u000a    clarification of the R2P responsibilities of states, the nature of the\u000a    crimes that R2P should address, and her arguments that prevention and\u000a    response should be integrated in R2P policies, have led to discussions with\u000a    policy makers at the highest level, including:M\u000a    \u000a      UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, culminating in Welsh's appointment\u000a        as Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect in 2013;\u000a      UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Francis Deng in\u000a        2012;\u000a      UN Secretary General's Special Adviser on R2P (at the time) Edward\u000a        Luck and Gareth Evans the former foreign minister of Australia (one of\u000a        the original authors of the R2P principle) in 2008;\u000a      High Commissioner for National Minorities of the Organisation for\u000a        Security and Co- operation in Europe (OSCE) (at the time) Knut Vollebaek\u000a        and his advisers in 2012 [C1];\u000a      The Policy Committee of the European Parliament in a special session\u000a        on R2P dedicated to formulating policy on the implementation of R2P\u000a        after Libya (March 2012) [See R4];\u000a\u000a      Policy makers within the UK, through consultations with officials in\u000a        the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2008.\u000a    \u000a    2. Shaping UN policy to integrate prevention and response,\u000a          and UN definitions of the crimes to which R2P applies\u000a      One of Welsh's central research contributions is to clarify how mass\u000a      atrocities can be prevented by the systemic and targeted use of preventive\u000a      tools and by integrating preventive action and response [R4, R7].\u000a      This analysis is reflected in the UN Secretary General's 2012 report, Responsibility\u000a        to Protect: Timely and Decisive Response. The report departs from\u000a      previous reports on the issue and reflects Welsh's research in emphasising\u000a      the key insight that prevention and response are closely connected and\u000a      must be structured to support each other [C2]. Thus, it examines\u000a      the range of tools available under the third (response) pillar and the\u000a      close connection between prevention and response [C3]. The report\u000a      explicitly notes that, `[s]ome may consider that prevention and\u000a        response are at opposite ends of the spectrum. In practice, however, the\u000a        two often merge..... It may be argued that the first two pillars of the\u000a        implementation strategy address prevention, and the third, response. The\u000a        dividing lines are, however, not so clear in practice' (paragraph\u000a      11). Furthermore, `[e]ffective action under the first and second\u000a        pillar may make action under the third pillar unnecessary. Pillar three\u000a        action should also contribute to the future achievement of first pillar\u000a        goals ... an informed and calibrated response can serve preventive goals\u000a        as well' (paragraph 15) [C3]. The prevention of atrocity\u000a      crimes (as opposed to the reactive response to unfolding mass atrocities)\u000a      is now a key consideration for the UN. Welsh's research made a substantial\u000a      contribution in shaping that objective [R7].\u000a    Welsh's work on the nature of the crimes that R2P should address is\u000a      currently informing revisions of the Framework of Analysis used by\u000a      the Office of the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide.\u000a      Initially the framework, which is a policy tool to support the assessment\u000a      of risk, was limited to genocide. Drawing on developments from R2P, it is\u000a      being revised to include three further types of mass atrocities: ethnic\u000a      cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity [C4].\u000a    3. Shaping acceptance of the integration of prevention and\u000a          response in R2P policies by UN member states\u000a      Through its impact on the UN Secretary General's report, Welsh's research\u000a      has shaped UN member-states' acceptance of the need to develop the\u000a      preventive dimension in policies to mitigate the risk of mass atrocity\u000a      crimes and to integrate the use of preventive tools with response. This is\u000a      evidenced by the General Assembly debate of the report on September 5,\u000a      2012 in which UN member-states expressed strong support for the insight\u000a      that prevention and response are interconnected and that R2P's third\u000a      pillar has an important preventive component (only some of these can be\u000a      reported here). As Denmark stressed: `Running through all three pillars\u000a        is an absolute commitment to prevention: prevention of an initial\u000a        outbreak of a crisis or conflict, prevention of its continuation and\u000a        escalation, and prevention of recurrence ... Prevention is part of\u000a        response. Prevention and response are thus mutually reinforcing, and\u000a        elements of both must be integrated.' The Republic of Korea noted\u000a      that, `one should not draw too sharp a distinction between prevention\u000a        and response...the three pillars are not sequential and are of equal\u000a        importance; without all three, the concept would be incomplete.'\u000a      Estonia concurred with the conclusions of the report on `the proximity\u000a        of the prevention and response sides of the R2P implementation.... The\u000a        International Criminal Court (ICC) ... is an example of one of the R2P\u000a        tools where the response and prevention sides of the implementation\u000a        strategy may merge, illustrating thus that strict sequencing the R2P\u000a        pillars would not be useful.' Direct reference to the use of\u000a      preventive tools is also made in the response of the Netherlands, which\u000a      stresses that `commissions of enquiry, mediation, sanctions, arms\u000a        embargoes, referral to the ICC and civil missions are all important\u000a        instruments in such a toolbox' [C2,C5].\u000a    4. Contributing to policy expertise and capacity building\u000a      Welsh's research has contributed in multiple ways to policy expertise and\u000a      capacity building in the wider community of policy institutes and NGOs\u000a      that focus on the prevention of mass atrocities. The Global Centre for the\u000a      Responsibility to Protect uses Welsh's research in its own policy forums\u000a      to focus the discussion with policy makers on preventive tools as a means\u000a      to make R2P policies effective. The Centre considers Welsh's work to be\u000a      one of the few resources available to support debate on prevention [C6].\u000a      Similarly, the Stanley Foundation stresses the benefits of Welsh's\u000a      research in structuring its work with policy actors on preventing the\u000a      perpetration of mass atrocity crimes. The Asia-Pacific Centre for the\u000a      Responsibility to Protect has reproduced Welsh's research findings in its\u000a      own policy briefs and regards the ELAC project as the most robust and\u000a      policy- relevant of the 14 projects funded by the Australian R2P fund [C7,C8].\u000a    In sum, Welsh's research is shaping the approach to prevention and\u000a      response of mass atrocities by the UN, its member states and the wider\u000a      policy community. This has implications for the choices of states and\u000a      international organisations that may invest lives and resources to prevent\u000a      mass atrocities, for populations at risk, and the perpetrators of such\u000a      crimes. The reach and significance of the impact of Professor Welsh's\u000a      research is evidenced by her appointment in July 2013 by the UN\u000a      Secretariat as Special Adviser to Ban Ki-moon, at the Assistant Secretary\u000a      General Level [C9, C10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Welsh's research focuses on the responsibility of states and\u000a      international organisations to protect populations from mass atrocities,\u000a      and argues that effective protection requires preventive action in\u000a      addition to reactive responses to unfolding crimes. The research has\u000a      directly informed the UN Secretary-General's 2012 report on the\u000a      Responsibility to Protect, which shapes how UN member-states interpret\u000a      their responsibilities, and is contributing to expertise and capacity\u000a      building in the wider policy community. In recognition of the importance\u000a      and impact of her research, Professor Welsh was appointed Special Adviser\u000a      to the United Nations Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect\u000a      (R2P) in July 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    University of Oxford\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[R1] Jennifer Welsh, `The Responsibility to Protect: Securing the\u000a      Individual in International Society?', in Security and Human Rights,\u000a      edited by B.

The\u000a      work led to her decision to co-found the Oxford Institute for Ethics,\u000a        Law and Armed Conflict (ELAC) with D. Akande and D. Rodin in 2008.\u000a      At ELAC Welsh and her team (Research Assistants S. Sharma and R. Reike,\u000a      both 2010-13) have worked to clarify the responsibilities implied by R2P\u000a      and the acts it should address, and have researched effective strategies\u000a      for mass atrocity prevention.\u000a    The principle of the Responsibility to Protect was conceived in 2001 and\u000a      endorsed by UN member states at the 2005 United Nations World Summit. It\u000a      encapsulates a commitment by states and international organisations to\u000a      protect populations from mass atrocities. The principle has three\u000a      `pillars': the responsibility of states to protect its citizens from\u000a      atrocities; the duty of the international community to assist states to do\u000a      so; and the responsibility of the international community to intervene\u000a      where a state fails to protect its citizens.\u000a    Three insights from Welsh's research have been particularly influential\u000a      in shaping policy:\u000a    1. Clarifying the nature of the responsibility\u000a      The research clarifies the nature of the R2P principle and identifies the\u000a      specific responsibilities it entails [Section 3: R1, R3]. Welsh\u000a      argues R2P is primarily a political principle (rather than a new\u000a      legal norm). It is designed to alert states to their existing legal\u000a      obligations to protect populations from mass atrocity crimes [R1, R2,\u000a        R6]. Her work shows that R2P is contested by its very nature &#8212;\u000a      particularly the third pillar of responsibility to intervene where a state\u000a      fails to protect its citizens &#8212; because it challenges other powerful\u000a      international norms such as sovereign equality and non- intervention [R6].\u000a      This insight has practical implications for the formulation and\u000a      legitimation of policies aiming to prevent mass atrocities.\u000a    2. Clarifying the nature of the acts that preventive measures\u000a          should address\u000a      Welsh's work clarifies the nature of the acts that preventive measures\u000a      should address. She establishes the importance of distinguishing atrocity\u000a      crime prevention and conflict prevention, and argues that responsibilities\u000a      to prevent mass atrocities should focus on four specific crimes under\u000a      international law: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes\u000a      against humanity [R3, R4, R7].\u000a    3. Working toward strategies for mass atrocity prevention\u000a      Welsh's research develops a framework of systemic and targeted strategies\u000a      for atrocity crime prevention, and analyses how R2P legitimises action to\u000a      prevent such crimes [R4, R7]. It distinguishes between preventive\u000a      tools to address the three elements of a crime situation - the behaviour\u000a      of perpetrators, the vulnerability of victims, and the permissiveness of\u000a      the environment. It examines tools that can be used to target particular\u000a      crises (e.g. sanctions, mediation, fact-finding missions, no-fly-zones)\u000a      and those that are systemic across all cases (e.g. strategies to increase\u000a      long-term resilience and reduce risk factors); and it explores the limits\u000a      of a crime prevention approach, particularly the difficulty in reconciling\u000a      individual criminal liability with traditional means of resolving\u000a      conflicts among state and non-state parties. A central insight of Welsh's\u000a      work is that the R2P principle must be interpreted not merely as reactive,\u000a      but as including a responsibility to prevent. As a consequence,\u000a      responsibilities to prevent and respond should be seen as integrated, and\u000a      as flowing from the R2P principle.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11434","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The practical applicability of the group's research findings accounts for\u000a      its broad impacts on governance in the UK, and on approaches to public\u000a      sector management by international institutions and other agencies. In the\u000a      UK, the research was disseminated widely through the ESRC Public Services\u000a      Programme, which drew the findings to the attention of senior policymakers\u000a      especially the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury. Articles, briefing papers,\u000a      events, the programme's website, and media coverage created visibility for\u000a      the research and increased engagement with stakeholders.\u000a    (a) Domestic impacts\u000a    Informing the government's performance framework: The\u000a      research findings concerning the use and effects of targets and indicators\u000a      fed into the re-assessment of the government's performance framework by\u000a      the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit. Hood and colleagues were invited in\u000a      2009 and 2010 to brief officials who used the insights on the use of\u000a      indicators in preparing policy briefs for ministers about the 2010\u000a      Performance Framework (published in 2011 as part of the new Coalition\u000a      approach to the performance management of government). The framework\u000a      proposals referenced Hood's work [C1], and senior civil servants\u000a      confirm that the research led politicians to question the widespread use\u000a      of targets and performance indicators and informed a more nuanced\u000a      understanding of how these tools can be used effectively [C2].\u000a    Contributing to the debate that led to the termination of the CPA\u000a          regime for English local authorities: The group's research on\u000a      the effects of the Comprehensive Performance Assessment regime deepened\u000a      concerns about the large number of targets applied to local authority\u000a      management. The research findings created intense policy and public\u000a      debate. In an article in the Guardian's `Public' magazine\u000a      (3.05.2007), McLean (et al.) published the findings and called for the CPA\u000a      `to be scrapped' [C3]. The Audit Commission (the body that oversaw\u000a      the CPA) responded with a defence of the CPA. However, the research,\u000a      particularly the insight that the CPA methodology risked compounding\u000a      socio-economic deprivation, contributed to the weight of evidence against\u000a      the CPA regime, which was replaced in 2009.\u000a    (b) Shaping approaches to public sector management internationally\u000a    The World Bank Group: At the invitation of the World Bank's\u000a      public sector governance team, Hood contributed to an international\u000a      meeting on performance budgeting (Mexico, June 2008), attended by senior\u000a      finance officials and development experts from across the Organisation for\u000a      Economic Co-operation and Development and South America. Hood's\u000a      contribution (by video) explained key research findings on performance\u000a      indicators and encouraged pragmatism and nuance in their use (viewed 2,940\u000a      times on Youtube, as of July 2013). The research shaped the discussion,\u000a      and Hood and Dixon's work was frequently referred to during the\u000a      proceedings [C4]. The ensuing World Bank publication particularly\u000a      highlights the research findings on the potential for performance\u000a      indicators to create unintended consequences and the risks of reform\u000a      overload [R2] [C5]. The World Bank uses these insights in\u000a      its approach to monitoring and assessment frameworks for public sector\u000a      management [C4].\u000a    Hood's research on the effective use of performance frameworks is also\u000a      used in the Small Countries Financial Management Programme supported by\u000a      the World Bank, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the University of Oxford\u000a      [R1 to R5]. The programme addresses the special financial\u000a      management challenges faced by small countries and serves senior officials\u000a      of ministries of finance, financial regulatory bodies and the central\u000a      banks of small countries [C6].\u000a    The Inter-American Development Bank: Like the World\u000a      Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank sponsors programmes to support\u000a      effective public service management. It used the research of the Public\u000a      Policy Group in programmes and workshops carried out over the last few\u000a      years on implementing performance frameworks in central governments. In\u000a      particular, the work on the ratchet, threshold, and distortive effects of\u000a      performance indicators [R4&amp; R5] was considered in the\u000a      preparation of the Bank's framework for performance management in central\u000a      governments and has subsequently been taken forward [C7].\u000a    (c) Shaping the wider policy and public debate about\u000a        the use of performance indicators\u000a      Under the aegis of the ESRC Public Services Programme the Public Policy\u000a      Group released a range of policy briefs including Hood, C. Dixon, R and\u000a      Wilson, D (2009) Managing by Numbers: the Way to Make Public Services\u000a        Better? (ESRC Public Services Programme Policy Briefing and\u000a      referenced in C5). Dixon, R, Hood, C and Wilson, D were asked by School\u000a        Leadership Today (2010) to write Keeping Up the Standards? The\u000a        Use of Targets and Rankings to Improve Performance. These articles\u000a      and the underlying research informed wider professional and public debates\u000a      about the use of performance indicators. In the education sector, for\u000a      example, the group's research on indicators and targets was used by the\u000a      European School Heads Association and the National Association of Head\u000a      Teachers in preparation for consultations with government and trade unions\u000a      over the revision of SATs inspection regimes in schools (2010-2012) [C8].\u000a      The group's research also impacted on the work of the 2020 Public Services\u000a      Trust (a cross-party think tank 2008-10) concerned to explore the role of\u000a      performance indicators in public service management in a period of fiscal\u000a      austerity. The Trust published an article by Hood in its own series on the\u000a      future of public services (2010), which it later re-published as an edited\u000a      collection (July 2013) [C9]. In addition, the research informed\u000a      the wider public debate in the media about performance indicators\u000a      including in The Financial Times, Guardian Public and The\u000a        Scotsman.\u000a    In sum, the research of the Oxford Public Policy Group has shaped\u000a      conceptual understandings of the uses, shortcomings and reliability of\u000a      targets and indicators in public sector management for a wide range of\u000a      major stakeholders in the UK and in the international community. The\u000a      impact has been to induce a more nuanced approach to the use of indicators\u000a      and substantially greater awareness of the unintended and perverse effects\u000a      of over-reliance on such data; insights that are now widely applied in\u000a      performance management. The impacts of the research were leveraged by the\u000a      fact that the work was embedded in the broader, Hood-directed ESRC's\u000a      Public Services Research Programme under which it was conducted.

Dr Ruth\u000a      Dixon joined the group in 2006 as a Postdoctoral Researcher. The work was\u000a      embedded in the wider ESRC Public Services Programme, directed by Hood\u000a      (2004 to 2010), who provided leadership and co-ordination for 47\u000a      ESRC-funded research projects at Oxford and across a number of UK\u000a      universities.\u000a    Quantitative indicators for performance management are a central feature\u000a      of modern public services. Arising out of a long-term research interest in\u000a      public policy and public administration, Hood and McLean's work (with\u000a      colleagues in each case) examined the scope and limits of performance\u000a      management `by numbers' in public services. Building on Goodhart's Law,\u000a      which was formulated in the mid-70s and which questions the value of a\u000a      measure that becomes a target, their research a) clarified how the effects\u000a      of performance indicators vary with the manner in which they are used, b)\u000a      analysed the nature of their distortive effects, and c) developed\u000a      approaches to assess their validity and reliability. The group's work in\u000a      each of these areas is central to the impacts described below.\u000a    (a) Clarifying how the effects of performance indicators differ\u000a          with the type of use\u000a      Research by Hood examines how the effect of performance indicators varies\u000a      with the use to which they are put by policymakers. The work analyses the\u000a      use of quantitative indicators as targets (threshold standards), rankings\u000a      (comparative leagues), and intelligence (background information for policy\u000a      and management) and demonstrates that effects associated with each of\u000a      these applications do not apply to them all [Section 3: R1&amp;R2].\u000a    (b) Analysing and demonstrating unintended effects\u000a      The second strand of the research probes the unintended effects of\u000a      `management by numbers', and shows that the use of targets and performance\u000a      indicators can produce distortions that are akin to those observed by\u000a      analysts of socialist planned economies. Drawing on that work, Hood\u000a      demonstrates that contemporary public service management systems in the UK\u000a      produce threshold effects (incentives to reduce effort once performance\u000a      has met the target), ratchet effects (supressing current outputs to reduce\u000a      future targets), and output distortions (a focus on meeting targets to the\u000a      detriment of substantive quality) for example in healthcare - waiting\u000a      times and ambulance response times. The research highlights these risks\u000a      and explores ways to reduce them. It also examines other implications of\u000a      target-focussed systems such as credit-claiming (claiming responsibility\u000a      for performance boosts that do not derive from improvements within the\u000a      organisation) and negativity bias (a focus on limiting the risk of falling\u000a      short of the performance standard over the pursuit of excellence) and\u000a      proposes ways to mitigate these effects [R4&amp;R5].\u000a    The practical implications of such unintended effects are demonstrated in\u000a      a number of ways by the research on the Comprehensive Performance\u000a      Assessment (CPA) that was applied to English local government from 2002.\u000a      McLean (et al.) showed that the CPA gave rise to potentially conflicting\u000a      incentives and perverse effects. Conflicting incentives arose because\u000a      meeting performance thresholds in one area could lead to a loss of support\u000a      in another. Perverse effects resulted because the CPA rewarded efficiency\u000a      in the operation of local authorities. However, authorities in deprived\u000a      parts of the country found it harder to operate efficiently (recruit\u000a      staff, collect local taxes) than did authorities in wealthier areas. Thus,\u000a      the CPA regime could compound disadvantage by contributing to withdrawal\u000a      of grants from poor areas of the country [R6].\u000a    (c) Developing an approach to assess the validity and reliability\u000a          of performance indicators\u000a      Despite their potentially negative effects, however, indicators and\u000a      benchmarking remain central to evidence-based public policy processes.\u000a      Hood and Dixon's work therefore developed a pioneering and systematic\u000a      approach to assess the validity and reliability of performance indicators.\u000a      This work on `rating the rankings' shows that it is possible to compare\u000a      and assess the usefulness of ranking surveys as tools of public\u000a      management. It also demonstrates a trade-off between the measurement\u000a      validity of a ranking and its reliability, a possibility that had not\u000a      previously been demonstrated [R3].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11807","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Informing Governance and Regulation: Islamic Financial Services is\u000a      one of the fasted growing\u000a      components of international finance, Shari'ah-compliant assets growing\u000a      globally from $400 billion\u000a      to $1,130 billion between 2009-13. Ethical investment vehicles have grown\u000a      in popularity in the\u000a      wake of the global financial crisis, and Islamic financial products are\u000a      being offered in many\u000a      countries and by Islamic and conventional finance providers. As the sector\u000a      develops to meet\u000a      demand, systems for its regulation and governance have become a major\u000a      issue within national and\u000a      global contexts, complicated by the absence of any globally-recognised\u000a      supreme Islamic authority.\u000a      The research done at the Durham Centre for Islamic Economics and Finance\u000a      has fed directly into\u000a      the sector's emerging regulatory and governance frameworks. For example,\u000a      Professor Wilson was\u000a      recruited by the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) in 2009 as a key\u000a      consultant in the\u000a      production of a report guiding governance of Shari'ah compliance in the\u000a      regulation of Islamic\u000a      financial organisations. The IFSB is an international standards-setting\u000a      organisation, made up of\u000a      regulatory and supervisory bodies, which issues prudential standards and\u000a      guiding principles for\u000a      banking, capital markets and insurance. Wilson participated in five IFSB\u000a      Shari'ah Governance\u000a      Working Group Meetings and subsequently contributed to authoring The\u000a        Guiding Principles on\u000a        Shari'ah Governance Systems for Institutions Offering Islamic Financial\u000a        Services (E1). The report\u000a      provided benchmarks for best practice in sector governance which are\u000a      promoted on the basis of\u000a      `comply or explain`. In October 2012 the Asian Development Bank signed a\u000a      five-year agreement\u000a      with the IFSB which will see the ADB supporting its 187 members (banks,\u000a      law firms and regulatory\u000a      institutions) in meeting the legal and regulatory aspects of these IFSB\u000a      standards, effectively\u000a      endorsing them as the principal set of international benchmarks and\u000a      standards of governance. The\u000a      agreement extends the influence of the IFSB, which is dominated by\u000a      regulatory bodies and private\u000a      institutions in more developed countries, into less developed countries\u000a      where the ADB has a\u000a      stronger presence. The ADB has established an initial $750,000 technical\u000a      assistance fund to help\u000a      implement the standards in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and\u000a      Indonesia. In assessing\u000a      Professor Wilson's contribution, the Special Envoy to the President of the\u000a      World Bank and member\u000a      of the World Bank Special Task Force on Islamic Finance, notes \"the\u000a      contributions of Professor\u000a      Rodney Wilson's seminal work to the development of the global Islamic\u000a      finance research. Through\u000a      his research, the study of Islamic Finance has deepened significantly.\u000a      Professor Wilson's\u000a      contribution provided a solid founation for the development of the global\u000a      regulatory standards for\u000a      the industry\" (E2). The CEO of Edbiz Consulting (a global Shari'ah\u000a      advisory company) and the\u000a      editor of industry magazine, Islamic Finance Review, has described\u000a      how leading industry\u000a      organisations such as the IFSB or the Bahrain-based Accounting and\u000a      Auditing Organisation for\u000a      Islamic Financial Institutions have \"directly or indirectly incorporated\u000a      the research conducted by\u000a      Durham staff in drawing governance, accounting, auditing and Shari'ah\u000a      standards. In this way,\u000a      Durham University has been on the forefront of developments in Islamic\u000a      Banking and Finance\u000a      around the world\". (E3). One example of this work is the annual\u000a      roundtable held jointly by the\u000a      International Shari'ah Research Academy (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), the\u000a      Islamic Research and\u000a      Training Institute (Islamic Development Bank, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia) and\u000a      Durham staff. Starting in\u000a      2011 in Durham, and subsequently taking place in Kuala Lumpur and Jeddah,\u000a      these bring leading\u000a      Shari'ah scholars, key industry figureheads and Durham staff together to\u000a      deliberate issues\u000a      surrounding governance and institutionalisation in the sector,\u000a      subsequently informing institutional\u000a      policy. The Special Advisor on Business and Economy Affairs to the\u000a      Secretary General of the\u000a      Muslim Council of Britain comments on the importance of Professor Wilson's\u000a      research in informing\u000a      regulatory bodies in countries such as Morroco and Qatar (E8).\u000a    Building capacity in the Islamic Financial Services Sector:\u000a      Research by Durham staff has fed\u000a      directly into the training of professional staff in the Islamic Finance\u000a      and conventional banking\u000a      sectors in three ways.\u000a    Firstly, Durham staff have drawn upon their research in delivering the\u000a      Durham Centre for Islamic\u000a      Economics and Finance annual Summer School (DIFSS), an executive training\u000a      course for existing\u000a      and aspiring sector professionals. Initiated in 2007, DIFSS has trained\u000a      over 400 participants from\u000a      the Far East, Middle East, South and South East Asia, Europe, Australia,\u000a      Africa and the USA. An\u000a      on-line survey conducted in Spring 2013 found that between 2008 and 2012,\u000a      94 individuals already\u000a      employed in the financial sector attended the events, and a further 64 are\u000a      known to have since\u000a      moved into professional employment in the sector. Responses described the\u000a      course as an\u000a      \"absolutely essential contribution to the industry\", as being \"well-known\u000a      worldwide for its major\u000a      influence and contribution in the development of the Islamic Finance\u000a      industry\" and as being \"very\u000a      important to develop relationships between Islamic bankers, academics and\u000a      students\" (E4). One\u000a      respondent noted that \"The role of DCIEF in the development of human\u000a      resources of the Islamic\u000a      finance and banking industry is worldwide\", another that \"DIFSS is helping\u000a      to improve human\u000a      resources of the Islamic Finance sector in general\" and another that\u000a      \"Durham's academic\u000a      leadership is of paramount important in developing human resources of the\u000a      IF sector\" (reiterated in\u000a      E8). One key impact is the building of unique professional networks\u000a      bringing industry figures\u000a      together with shari'ah scholars. The CEO of Al-Fajr Capital Group (one of\u000a      the world's largest\u000a      private Islamic Financial Investment Groups) describes the event as \"a\u000a      landmark event in the\u000a      Islamic Finance industry's calendar\" which \"has contributed immensely to\u000a      the professional\u000a      development and training of Islamic bankers, financial analysts, lawyers\u000a      and regulators.....Through\u000a      these interactions, many opportunities are created for British firms and\u000a      British companies to do\u000a      more business with the Islamic Finance world... Durham University has\u000a      contributed uniquely to the\u000a      growth and development of the human capital of the Islamic Finance\u000a      industry and I have no\u000a      hesitation in saying this is one of the most unique and important\u000a      programmes supporting the\u000a      growth and evolution of the Islamic Finance industry and building goodwill\u000a      for the United Kingdom\u000a      (E5). Global Islamic Review stated \"Those who have attended\u000a      various DIFSS trainings over the\u000a      last seven years have benefitted from in-depth analysis of Islamic banking\u000a      and finance from both\u000a      an academic as well as practitioner's viewpoints\" (E6)\u000a    Training activities have been extended to partnerships with professional\u000a      and sector organisations.\u000a      For example, Rodney Wilson has delivered regular (2 or more per year)\u000a      training for private firms\u000a      such as Euromoney Legal Training and Central Banking since 2008 on courses\u000a      targeted at in-house\u000a      lawyers, Islamic finance professionals, international bankers and\u000a      financiers, lawyers in\u000a      private practice, asset and fund managers, venture capitalists, compliance\u000a      officers, investment\u000a      advisers and leasing professionals. Wilson, Asutay and Ahmed have all\u000a      delivered training for\u000a      industry professionals through The Islamic Research and Training Institute\u000a      of the Islamic\u000a      Development Bank (based in Saudi Arabia), the International Shari'ah\u000a      Research Academy in\u000a      Malaysia, Kyoto University in Japan, the Chartered Institute of Management\u000a      Accountants, and the\u000a      International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (a Malaysia-based\u000a      university offering\u000a      professional qualifications in Islamic Finance). A partnership between the\u000a      DCIEF, Hawkamah\u000a      Institute of Corporate Governance for the MENA Region and Dar al-Sharia'ah\u000a      Legal and Financial\u000a      Consultancy in Dubai, delivers an annual training programme targeting\u000a      professionals in the finance\u000a      industry which addresses Islamic Securitization, Sukuk Structures and\u000a        Documentation (September\u000a      2011, April 2012, May 2013).

At that time, short-comings in neo-classical\u000a      economics and finance\u000a      necessitated a paradigm shift recognising the impact of culture and\u000a      religion on individuals'\u000a      behaviour in the market place. Simultaneously, the first modern Islamic\u000a      Finance institutions,\u000a      established in the late 1970s but marginal market actors until this time,\u000a      began rapid growth in size\u000a      and market penetration. The nascent Islamic financial services sector was\u000a      poorly equipped to\u000a      translate textually-derived Islamic norms into practical financial\u000a      services. Wilson's work pioneering\u000a      the study of Islamic economics from within the disciplines of economics\u000a      and political economy,\u000a      exploring its philosophical foundations and moral economy, was therefore\u000a      of enormous interest to\u000a      the sector. A series of exploratory research publications culminated in R1\u000a      below. The book\u000a      compared the ethical underpinnings of the three Abrahamic faiths as they\u000a      impacted on economics\u000a      and finance, substantiating the rationale for the emerging Islamic finance\u000a      industry and offering\u000a      theoretical and foundational logics connecting normative aspirations with\u000a      operational\u000a      manifestations. By identifying the normative underpinnings of economic\u000a      behaviour governed by\u000a      Islam (a perspective neglected by mainstream economic thought), and\u000a      comparing this to existing\u000a      perspectives on Christian and Jewish economics, Wilson brought Islamic\u000a      finance into the\u000a      mainstream of thought on banking and finance in the modern world. His\u000a      contribution to\u000a      foundational theory in this area has been unique and &#8212; as one testimonial\u000a      makes clear (E8) - was\u000a      `seminal and ahead of its time'.\u000a    Dr Mehmet Asutay's (employed Oct 2005-present) research has substantiated\u000a      and developed\u000a      Wilson's position, arguing that Islamic religious ethics can produce a new\u000a      political economy\u000a      framework, with its own methodology and founding axioms. Again, moving\u000a      beyond neo-classical\u000a      economic formulations, this extends the debate into issues of development,\u000a      social justice, welfare\u000a      and the role of the state. R3 exemplifies this research, offering\u000a      an alternative to the neo-classical\u000a      utility function and suggesting a three dimensional utility function\u000a      endogenising the interest of\u000a      society as well as spiritual accountability in the construction of\u000a      individual utility function.\u000a    These theoretical works provided the emerging Islamic financial service\u000a      sector with theoretical\u000a      pathways against which to benchmark emerging governance structures and\u000a      product development.\u000a      Subsequent Durham research developed the new Islamic economics paradigm to\u000a      offer structures\u000a      for sector regulation and institutional governance. R2 is an\u000a      example of this research, where Wilson\u000a      suggested that, in the absence of a single globally-recognised Islamic\u000a      authority, and in the context\u000a      of the dual (conventional and Islamic) banking system, additional layers\u000a      of regulations had to be\u000a      developed to internalise within individual firms the particular governance\u000a      and risk management\u000a      needs of Islamic financial products and instruments.\u000a    The 2008 financial crisis indicates that ethically-constructed financial\u000a      systems are more resilient\u000a      than conventional systems. In R5 Professor Habib Ahmed (employed\u000a      Sep. 2008 - present) argued\u000a      that Islamic ethics provide an additional layer of protection for firms\u000a      and customers alike since they\u000a      avoid the risks associated with toxic products and speculation and\u000a      maintain a focus on an asset-based\u000a      economy in contrast with the conventional financial sector. Since joining\u000a      Durham in 2008,\u000a      his research has developed frameworks for structuring the shari'ah\u000a      compliance of evolving\u000a      financial products (R6). This research builds on the theoretical\u000a      contributions of Wilson and Asutay,\u000a      aligning it with the technical requirements of the sector.\u000a    Growth in the Islamic financial sector and the development of Islamic\u000a      finance products by\u000a      conventional sector actors has created concern about `convergence' between\u000a      Islamic and\u000a      conventional finance, challenging compliance with Islamic ethical\u000a      foundations. R4 suggested that\u000a      developments in the Islamic finance industry should self-consciously\u000a      conform to the framework\u000a      suggested in Wilson and Asutay's earlier works, reversing the trend for\u000a      what is a market-driven\u000a      industry to expose itself to the prevailing (conventional) paradigm,\u000a      framing this in terms of\u000a      privileging the `substance' of compliance over its `form'. The sector\u000a      weaknesses identified by the\u000a      paper have been recognised by major actors which have since engaged Durham\u000a      researchers in\u000a      deliberating their responses.\u000a    In sum, the rapid growth, widening geographic appeal and resilience of\u000a      the Islamic finance sector\u000a      offers important lessons for global political economy. Durham's\u000a      contribution has been to identify\u000a      the authentic ethical, foundational framework for the sector and the\u000a      means, models and\u000a      implications for its operationalisation.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11808","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This recognised expertise led legal firms engaged in asylum cases to\u000a      approach Davidson to act as an expert witness. Sections from his books (R1,\u000a      R2, and R3) and information from the journal articles (R4,\u000a        R5 and R6) were included and updated in the expert witness\u000a      reports provided by Davidson over the REF period. In one case of\u000a      particular importance, Christopher Davidson provided three expert witness\u000a      reports in 2009. This was Britain's longest running extradition case, and\u000a      one which had far-reaching implications.\u000a    Mohammed Lodhi, a Pakistani national, was arrested in the UK in 2000 on\u000a      an extradition warrant issued by the UAE for alleged drugs-related\u000a      offences in Dubai. The High Court initially granted extradition and\u000a      rejected a petition on human rights grounds. It agreed to a judicial\u000a      review, the process by which the High Court can test that the exercise of\u000a      public power on\u000a      an individual is lawful. The review in 2009 was the first major test of\u000a      the 2008 extradition treaty between the UK and UAE. Davidson was recruited\u000a      as an expert witness by Lodhi's solicitors, Corker Binning, and his\u000a      reports drew attention to the use of torture in the UAE and the risk that\u000a      a person's race or nationality could prejudice the outcome of a trial in\u000a      Dubai. He also highlighted a pre-existing dispute, between an UAE ruling\u000a      family member and the defendant, which was likely to prevent a fair trial\u000a      from taking place. Davidson's contributions included sections taken from\u000a      his publications. He expanded on this material by conducting fresh\u000a      research, arguing that the details of the case demonstrated the UAE's lack\u000a      of a human rights culture and the prospect that elite members of society\u000a      could interfere in the judicial process.\u000a    Lodhi died of natural causes shortly after the review hearing but the\u000a      Court decided to proceed with its judgment because of its significance.\u000a      The judgement, issued in March 2010 (E1), quoted Davidson's\u000a      references to a `sheikhly dispute' and agreed it was possible that Lodhi\u000a      had fallen victim to such a circumstance. Further paraphrasing Davidson's\u000a      report, the judges added: `The frequency and extent of the breaches [of a\u000a      right not to be tortured] which has arisen for others involved in this\u000a      case... have led us to the conclusion that they cannot sufficiently\u000a      diminish the real risk... that were Mr Lodhi to be extradited to the UAE\u000a      his [right not to be tortured] would be breached before trial, or during\u000a      imprisonment after conviction.' The Court noted that Davidson's evidence\u000a      was `essentially unchallenged'. The Court then quashed the extradition\u000a      order on the basis that Lodhi's Article 3 rights (protection from torture,\u000a      inhuman and degrading treatment; the most significant rights enshrined in\u000a      the ECHR) were in danger. Judgment was not appealed. Corker Binning\u000a      described the case as `an historic victory' and described Davidson's\u000a      reports as `an extremely important evidential plank'.\u000a    The significance of the case is summed up by a partner in Corker Binning,\u000a      who says in a letter dated 6 June 2012 (E2 ): `The judgement was\u000a        important in legal terms. This was for three principal reasons. First,\u000a        to win an extradition case on human rights grounds is extremely\u000a        rare....Second, the judgement was &#8212; and remains &#8212; the only detailed\u000a        legal analysis of the UAE's criminal justice system that exists in\u000a        English law. Third, as this was the first extradition request made to\u000a        the UK by the UAE, the judgement dented the (then) relatively new\u000a        extradition treaty between the two countries.'\u000a    The international reach of the judgement is reflected in its use as a\u000a      reference point by other parties. Australians for Extradition Justice\u000a      (AEJ), a group campaigning against ratification of an extradition treaty\u000a      between Australia and UAE, cited the Lodhi judgment in 2010 in\u000a      representations to the Australian government and in public statements (E3),\u000a      arguing that the terms of the proposed treaty did not offer the protection\u000a      that was afforded to Lodhi under the terms of the treaty between the UK\u000a      and the UAE. Although the Australian government subsequently ratified the\u000a      treaty, AEJ won an important concession, in that the treaty was modified\u000a      to offer greater protection of human rights, along similar lines to the UK\u000a      treaty. AEJ commented: \"The Australian Government ... tabled an\u000a        important document in the Senate which must be used when considering\u000a        extradition to the UAE. Publicising the Lodhi case was important in\u000a        achieving this outcome, which will make it much harder to extradite\u000a        somebody from Australia\"(E3).\u000a    In the USA, attorneys for Zack Shahin, a US citizen detained in Dubai\u000a      since 2008 on disputed corruption charges, cited the details of the Lodhi\u000a      case (E4) when they called on the Secretary of State, Hilary\u000a      Clinton, to demand that the UAE review its procedures on how charges are\u000a      filed against expatriates.\u000a    The Lodhi case was further cited by Amnesty International, in its 2010\u000a      campaigning publication `Dangerous Deals' (E5), which drew\u000a      attention to dangers of European countries relying on diplomatic\u000a      assurances against the torture of people deported or extradited to\u000a      countries that do not adhere to the same human rights agreements. The high\u000a      profile and significance of the Lodhi case is also reflected in the\u000a      extensive media coverage in the UK, for example the Financial Times and\u000a      the BBC (E6 and E7 below).\u000a    The Lodhi case further served as a point of reference in a more recent\u000a      case, a district judge denied a request from the UAE government for the\u000a      extradition of Mr Yasir Afsar, a British-Pakistani expatriate, after\u000a      considering a new expert evidence statement provided by Christopher\u000a      Davidson on 4 February 2013. It is acknowledged here that the final\u000a      judgement for this case was not issued until 15 August 2013, and is beyond\u000a      the impact census date for this exercise. However the defendant's\u000a      solicitors (Kaim Todner Associates) drew extensively on the previous case\u000a      and Davidson's new evidence in presenting their arguments during the\u000a      period January-July 2013 and a letter from these solicitors to Dr Davidson\u000a      (E8), confirms the importance of Davidson's contribution, stating\u000a      that the judge talked `at great length about your [Davidson's] evidence\u000a      and it was clear it was of great value in leading him to the conclusion\u000a      that he did'. The judgement itself is presented as E9 below,\u000a      points 20,21,22 referring to the Lodhi case, points 22, 26 and 27\u000a      referring to Davidson's expert evidence statement).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Drawing from his extensive research on the politics of the United Arab\u000a      Emirates, Christopher Davidson provided a key expert witness report in\u000a      Britain's longest running extradition case, resulting in a significant\u000a      legal impact for the United Kingdom.

Most of this\u000a      research was conducted in the UAE itself, with hundreds of interviews\u000a      having been conducted with government officials, academics, NGO employees,\u000a      journalists, and other civil society actors. Archives, public records, and\u000a      a large number of NGO reports and other documents were also consulted in\u000a      the UAE.\u000a    The research culminated in three single authored books published in 2005,\u000a      2008 and 2009. The first of these (R1) was an exploration of the\u000a      history, politics and economics of the United Arab Emirates, which argued\u000a      that a complex ruling bargain had developed between the traditional\u000a      monarchies which ruled the Emirates and who controlled the vast oil\u000a      reserves, and the citizens. Oil wealth was used to shore up systems of\u000a      privilege and distribution, while cultural heritages were sagely exploited\u000a      to mobilise populations in support of monarchical claims to legitimacy.\u000a      Going beyond conventional rentier theory, Davidson exposed the political\u000a      conflicts and weakness which resulted from this model. Specifically, he\u000a      documented the tight government control of civil society groups, and the\u000a      power of the ruling family and its allies in co-opting or restricting\u000a      those who sought to challenge their dominance, including human rights\u000a      organisations and activists. His second book (R2), focused on the\u000a      UAE's second-largest emirate of Dubai and deepened the critique, featuring\u000a      extensive discussion of the emirate's political process, its judicial\u000a      system, and its human rights record. Other controversial subjects\u000a      discussed included money laundering, prostitution, the funding of\u000a      terrorism, and gun-running. The book outlined the way in which Emirati\u000a      legal processes are manipulated to repress dissident voices and contain\u000a      opposition, subordinating judicial process to the interests of the ruling\u000a      family and its friends. The third volume (R3) focused on the UAE's\u000a      largest and wealthiest emirate of Abu Dhabi and featured chapters on the\u000a      emirate's ruling family, its dominance of the UAE's federal government and\u000a      judicial system, and the UAE's overall human rights record. Crucially for\u000a      this case study, it developed a direct critique of legal systems which\u000a      subordinated non-nationals to nationals, effectively depriving the former\u000a      of legal \"rights\" through systems of informal manipulation. Further\u000a      research, published in significant Area Studies journals, developed some\u000a      of these themes in greater detail. R4 examined the political\u000a      system more closely, assessing the potential for substantive political\u000a      reform in the UAE in the content of regional discourses about\u000a      democratization, the introduction of electoral politics, and succession.\u000a      The tight grip on absolute power by the ruling family within the\u000a      wealthiest Emirate (Abu Dhabi) was examined in R6, with Davidson\u000a      arguing that there was little likelihood that this would be surrendered\u000a      through the processes of succession. Finally, R5 provides an\u000a      example of Davidson's work on the maintenance of international and\u000a      internal security for the Emirates. These publications have established\u000a      him as a premier analyst of the Arab Gulf countries, offering a clear and\u000a      informed critique of the structures and weaknesses of judicial and\u000a      political processes.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11809","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1873107","Name":"North Korea"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Ehteshami's work with senior FCO officials draws on both specific outputs\u000d\u000a      listed above (R1-6) and on his academic standing as manifested through a\u000d\u000a      large body of research outputs, some co-produced with FCO staff, published\u000d\u000a      over many years. Identifying the impact of specific research outputs and\u000d\u000a      specific scholars in a complex policy-making process is challenging,\u000d\u000a      especially where impact is upon a department like the FCO that produces\u000d\u000a      very little legislation and which is comparatively lightly scrutinised by\u000d\u000a      Parliament. It is therefore notable that senior FCO officials such as the\u000d\u000a      Head of Research Analysts and the MENA Energy Adviser\u000d\u000a      identify Ehteshami's specific, contribution in terms of `two strands of\u000d\u000a      activity that particularly stand out' (E1) and `...specific pieces of\u000d\u000a      research\/interventions that have not only informed the policy, but also\u000d\u000a      survived and shaped the policy outcome.' (E2)\u000d\u000a    Asianisation of the Middle East and UK Energy policy\u000d\u000a    Impact in the qualifying period is rooted in R1, itself the outcome of a\u000d\u000a      joint FCO\/Durham seminar, and R2, both specifically cited in E1.\u000d\u000a      The Head of the FCO Research Analysts notes (E1) that, `... the impact of\u000d\u000a      Prof Ehteshami's pioneering work has been strong and is continuing: the\u000d\u000a      interests of Russia and Asian countries (particularly China) in the Middle\u000d\u000a      East is now one of the main themes of Research Analysts' work. ... [T]his\u000d\u000a      intellectual leadership on Prof Ehteshami's part has established him as\u000d\u000a      someone whose expertise is indispensable to our thinking on this topic.'\u000d\u000a      The FCO MENA Energy Advisor identifies how Ehteshami's research in R1\u000d\u000a      has directly affected the UK's current International Energy Strategy: `The\u000d\u000a      importance attached to the historical and contemporary links between Asia\u000d\u000a      and the Middle East, as highlighted in the paper, were overlooked when\u000d\u000a      discussions over the IES first took place. The historical relationship\u000d\u000a      between the UK\/West and the GCC, in particular, led policy-makers to\u000d\u000a      believe that energy relations, for example, between Qatar and the UK,\u000d\u000a      would be served by shared experience and common commercial interests.\u000d\u000a      Professor Ehteshami's paper, however, highlighted not only the historical\u000d\u000a      importance of Asian and Middle East relations, but also charted the\u000d\u000a      re-orientation of GCC economic and energy policy towards Asia, most\u000d\u000a      notably China and South Korea. This line of analysis was both informative\u000d\u000a      and persuasive and resulted in the IES recommending that the UK diversify\u000d\u000a      Liquified Natural Gas sources away from the Gulf and towards other\u000d\u000a      markets.'\u000d\u000a    Diversification of supply as an element of maintaining reliable energy at\u000d\u000a      a time of declining North Sea output and increasing reliance on gas\u000d\u000a      imports was a key theme of the 2007 Energy White Paper, `Meeting the\u000d\u000a      Energy Challenge' which has shaped UK energy policy throughout the\u000d\u000a      assessment period. Similarly, the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security\u000d\u000a      Review, `Securing Britain in an Age of Uncertainty,' notes that the `UK\u000d\u000a      faces a range of risks related to our ability to access secure, diverse\u000d\u000a      and affordable supplies of energy, which are essential to economic\u000d\u000a      stability and growth.' (E4 p.50) The UK should `give energy a\u000d\u000a      higher priority in UK foreign policy,' and, `reprioritise bilateral\u000d\u000a      diplomatic relationships, giving key supplier states a stronger focus.' (E4\u000d\u000a      p.51) As E2 further notes: `[The] FCO's Policy Unit Strategy Paper\u000d\u000a      on Energy and Foreign Policy, which hitherto had neglected the importance\u000d\u000a      of Asianisation of the Middle East ... [now] included reinvigorating\u000d\u000a      energy relations between the UK and GCC ... and supporting UK-based\u000d\u000a      international oil companies (IOCs) in their bid to work with MENA national\u000d\u000a      oil companies (NOCs) within Asia. The FCO has followed these\u000d\u000a      recommendations with vigour.' This further reflects the emphasis in the\u000d\u000a      FCO `Business Plan, 2011-15' (November 2010) on `a more commercially\u000d\u000a      minded FCO' (E5, p. 5) stimulating business partnerships vital to\u000d\u000a      the UK national interest and that `We [the FCO] want the UK to be the\u000d\u000a      Gulf's commercial partner of choice.'(E6)\u000d\u000a    Ehteshami has continued to provide the FCO with what the Head of Research\u000d\u000a      Analysts (E1) describes as `intellectual leadership', participating\u000d\u000a      in the MENA 2020 Seminar, co-hosted by British Embassy Beijing\/China\u000d\u000a      Institute of International Studies, as a member of the FCO delegation in\u000d\u000a      September 2011. Including an academic as a formal member of FCO\u000d\u000a      delegations is very unusual, reflecting the significance of this\u000d\u000a      relationship.\u000d\u000a    The MENA Energy Advisor (E2) picks out the impact of Ehtehsami's\u000d\u000a      work on Asianisation for the UK's first GCC Regional Economist via the FCO\u000d\u000a      workshop `The Impact of Asianisation of Energy Streams on Europe', which\u000d\u000a      Ehteshami helped organise. This meeting, `...opened important doors at\u000d\u000a      leading academic institutions in each of the six [GCC] countries. As a\u000d\u000a      result, the regional economist sends regular diplomatic cables, which\u000d\u000a      inform policy, replete with direct references to academic materials\u000d\u000a      written and recommended by Professor Ehteshami. ... I can see a clear\u000d\u000a      correlation between Professor Ehteshami's continuing contribution towards\u000d\u000a      his analysis, which amounts to direct impact. Moreover, the GCC Regional\u000d\u000a      Economist has recommended that we institutionalise the briefing process,\u000d\u000a      as he was able to deploy and begin reporting within record time.'\u000d\u000a    Iran\u000d\u000a    Iran's nuclear programme is at the centre of Ehteshami's relationship\u000d\u000a      with and impact upon the FCO, building on engagement pre-dating the\u000d\u000a      assessment period including provision of evidence in 2007 to Parliament's\u000d\u000a      Foreign Affairs Committee in its Global Security Enquiry and his briefing\u000d\u000a      of then Prime Minister Tony Blair in March 2006.\u000d\u000a    The 2010 UK National Security Strategy identifies an international\u000d\u000a      military crisis as a `Tier 1' (i.e. most serious) risk, with `...the\u000d\u000a      desire of some states to acquire nuclear weapons capabilities increasing\u000d\u000a      the danger of escalating crises.' (E7, pp. 27, 30) Iran is cited as\u000d\u000a      the key risk state (alongside North Korea) in the UK's `National\u000d\u000a      Counter-Proliferation Strategy, 2012-15' (E8, p. 2). The UK is a\u000d\u000a      key member of the 6 party group leading diplomatic negotiations with Iran\u000d\u000a      on the issue, and in developing a global sanctions regime through the EU\u000d\u000a      and UN.\u000d\u000a    Ehteshami's outputs (R4-6) are directly cited by E1, with\u000d\u000a      E2 also identifying the role played by R3 in influencing UK\u000d\u000a      policy towards Iran. These outputs, alongside three specific briefing\u000d\u000a      events between 2010 and 2012 are identified (E1) as having`...\u000d\u000a      been particularly important since the closure of our [UK] embassy in\u000d\u000a      Tehran' as `... an important source of corroboration, as access to\u000d\u000a      reliable data is scarce.' E2 notes that Ehteshami's research\u000d\u000a      outputs and his bespoke presentations have, `fed specifically into the UK\u000d\u000a      government's wider calculations on how the Iranian government is likely to\u000d\u000a      respond to increased sanctions. ... Ehteshami's consistent argument that\u000d\u000a      the Supreme Leader and the instruments of state will not succumb to\u000d\u000a      sanctions pressure in its bid for nuclear status has fed directly into\u000d\u000a      policy discussions. ... Ehteshami's analysis has not only helped shape\u000d\u000a      aspects of the UK government's research agenda on Iran, but also the focus\u000d\u000a      of partner countries. That is direct impact.'\u000d\u000a    In particular, the MENA Energy Advisor (E2) specifies that\u000d\u000a      `...Ehteshami's nuanced argument that pressure felt amongst those sections\u000d\u000a      of Iranian society living just above the average household income has the\u000d\u000a      greatest potential to influence the Iranian regime has set apart the UK\u000d\u000a      government's approach from its partners. ... .

Ehteshami has been employed continuously by\u000d\u000a      Durham University since 1992.\u000d\u000a    a) Ehteshami's research in this area extends over nearly 20 years,\u000d\u000a      initiated in the mid-1990s with study of emerging Central Asian republics\u000d\u000a      as they engaged with Middle Eastern states. This work located Gulf states\u000d\u000a      in an increasingly Asian regional context, identifying emerging links &#8212;\u000d\u000a      political, cultural and economic. Subsequent research picked out two\u000d\u000a      consequent and principal dynamics of significance for this impact\u000d\u000a      case-study. Firstly, the role of energy as driving the deepening of Middle\u000d\u000a      Eastern, especially Gulf, engagement with an Asian region. For example, a\u000d\u000a      workshop co-hosted with the FCO, resulted in Ehteshami, `Asian\u000d\u000a      geostrategic realities and their impact on Middle East-Asia relations' in\u000d\u000a      H. Carter and A. Ehteshami (eds), The Middle East's Relations with\u000d\u000a        Asia and Russia, (R1). This paper accounted for the ways in\u000d\u000a      which the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the USSR had changed the\u000d\u000a      geopolitics of the Asian continent, enabling Asian peripheral countries\u000d\u000a      not only to penetrate the Asian heartland, but also to pursue profitable\u000d\u000a      links with each other unhindered, not least through energy transactions.\u000d\u000a      Ehteshami's later research publications further examined processes and\u000d\u000a      systems of regionalisation within a globalising world, arguing that\u000d\u000a      globalisation can only be understood in the geopolitical context of\u000d\u000a      regions and their diverse interactions. R2 (A. Ehteshami and\u000d\u000a      S&#252;leyman Elik, the latter then a doctoral student at Durham), `Turkey's\u000d\u000a      Growing Relations with Iran and the Arab Middle East') is an example of\u000d\u000a      this, in which he identified the ways in which the MENA subsystem's\u000d\u000a      non-Arab states (specifically Turkey and Iran) contributed to the shaping\u000d\u000a      and fragmenting of the regional order. The paper argued that Iran-Turkey\u000d\u000a      relations had themselves become a dynamic within a changing Arab order,\u000d\u000a      not least because of the latter's location within the broader Asian\u000d\u000a      context. A process which Ehteshami identifies as `Asianisation of the\u000d\u000a      Persian Gulf', is symptomatic of an Eastwards shift in the global balance\u000d\u000a      of power. This challenges the assumptions of a Westward oriented Gulf\u000d\u000a      rooted in mutual self-interest in maintaining established energy supplies\u000d\u000a      and other links, stressing that an `Asianised' Middle East will be a\u000d\u000a      different sort of partner and that Western policy-makers must not assume\u000d\u000a      existing connections will continue unchanged.\u000d\u000a    b) Ehteshami's work on post-revolutionary Iran also dates back to the\u000d\u000a      mid-1990s. On-going research examining Iranian politics has sought to make\u000d\u000a      sense of constitutional and factional tensions behind struggles for\u000d\u000a      control of a revolutionary state, an example being Iran and the Rise\u000d\u000a        of its Neoconservatives: The Politics of Tehran's Silent Revolution\u000d\u000a      (R3). This book was the first work to postulate that the\u000d\u000a      post-Khatami president brought to power Iran's own unique group of\u000d\u000a      military-linked conservatives, whose lower-middle class roots enabled them\u000d\u000a      to climb ladders of power unchallenged, and to use populist discourses to\u000d\u000a      dominate the republic's agenda. The analysis included consideration of\u000d\u000a      foreign policy, which has also been a consistent theme of Ehteshami's\u000d\u000a      research and which has become intensely policy-relevant as Iran's efforts\u000d\u000a      to achieve a nuclear energy, and arguably a military nuclear capability,\u000d\u000a      have progressed. UK policy in this area has had to respond rapidly to\u000d\u000a      events as they occur, and very recent publications have been able to make\u000d\u000a      their impact felt within FCO thinking. In `Iran and the International\u000d\u000a      Community: In the Shadow of Iraq', (R4), Ehteshami considered the\u000d\u000a      implications of WMD proliferation in the volatile regional politics of the\u000d\u000a      Persian Gulf and the broader Middle East, arguing the case that\u000d\u000a      unrestrained proliferation in the form of Iranian acquisition of a\u000d\u000a      military nuclear capability would only further destabilise regional\u000d\u000a      politics and fuel strategic rivalries. Reflecting on the strategic\u000d\u000a      consequences of the 2003 Iraq war, he argued that the balance of power has\u000d\u000a      changed so fundamentally in the region that one cannot make assumptions\u000d\u000a      regarding a stabilising or deterrent impact arising from proliferation, or\u000d\u000a      subsequent parity between regional powers. Further research on regional\u000d\u000a      security included: `Security and Strategic Trends in the Middle East' in\u000d\u000a      Held and Ulrichson (eds), The Transformation of the Gulf: Politics,\u000d\u000a        Economics and the Global Order (R5), which focuses on the\u000d\u000a      strategic horizon of the region in the post 9\/11 order, highlighting the\u000d\u000a      role of identity politics and providing an explanation for their growing\u000d\u000a      securitization. In `The Middle East: Regional Security Institutions and\u000d\u000a      their Capacities', in Rewiring Regional Security in a Fragmented World\u000d\u000a      (R6), which was part of a large United States Institute for Peace\u000d\u000a      project, he surveyed the capacity of regional institutions to manage the\u000d\u000a      range of inter and intra state tensions shaping state behaviour,\u000d\u000a      concluding that they are collectively weak and largely ineffective.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12379","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2103350","Name":"Solomon Islands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact arising from the research undertaken is evidenced across three\u000a      substantive and interlinked areas outlined below. While impacts of user\u000a      engagement, service provision and policy development are demonstrated\u000a      during the REF period, they emanate from Miller's longer term engagement\u000a      with national\/international bodies and publics.\u000a    1.Public policy, parenting and gender\u000a    The findings from the fatherhood research led in 2012 to an appointment\u000a      to serve as a member of a Labour party policy review panel on fatherhood\u000a      chaired by the Rt Hon David Lammy MP. The report and policy\u000a      recommendations have recently been published [7]. Other advisory\u000a      invitations following from the Fatherhood research have included a DfE\u000a      funded project '4Children' involving discussions on parenting with\u000a      officials from No. 10, the Cabinet Office and DfE (July 2011). The policy\u000a      implications of the fatherhood research findings also led to an invitation\u000a      to write a commentary for IPPR on coalition changes to parental leave\u000a      policy [6] and in June 2013 the research was highlighted in a\u000a      parliamentary debate on young fathers and family engagement and Miller and\u000a      her research were noted in Hansard [8].\u000a    2.Socio-cultural dimensions of reproduction, gender and international\u000a        policy\u000a    As a direct result of the publication of her 2005 monograph `Making\u000a        sense of Motherhood' which included analysis of childbearing in the\u000a      UK, Bangladesh and the Solomon Islands, Miller was engaged as a technical\u000a      advisor by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to report and advise on the\u000a      socio-cultural contexts and challenges relating to the global introduction\u000a      of the Human Papillomavirus vaccine. Initially this involved a\u000a      presentation on sociocultural issues and reproductive health at the\u000a      WHO\/UNFPA meeting on `Preparing for the introduction of HPV vaccines:\u000a        policy and programme guidance' held in Switzerland in 2006. Key\u000a      points from Miller's presentation on socio-cultural issues were included\u000a      in the final implementation document and policy guidance in 2007 [9].\u000a      Miller was also invited to contribute to a subsequent WHO (Europe) meeting\u000a      (`Role of health professionals working with adolescents in the\u000a        introduction of HPV vaccines') in Copenhagen, 2007 to present her\u000a      research findings on gender and reproductive health to policy makers and\u000a      programme managers rolling out the HPV vaccine across Europe. In the\u000a      period since 2008 the implementation of international HPV guidelines\u000a      resulting from these meetings and the roll out of vaccine coverage has had\u000a      global reach and significance. Following these appointments, Miller's\u000a      research findings from her studies on motherhood and fatherhood\u000a      transitions have led to further appointments with WHO including a\u000a      sabbatical spent in the Department of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health\u000a      in 2011 as a member of an expert international team who undertook a\u000a      systematic review of global changes in providers of childbirth care [5].\u000a      Miller is currently an advisor to another WHO international systematic\u000a      review team examining the influence of sociocultural issues on childbirth\u000a      service use. This review results from a concept paper (`Interventions\u000a        to address cultural barriers to the use of maternal and newborn health\u000a        services: An overview and concept paper') which WHO commissioned\u000a      Miller to write in 2007.\u000a    3) Contemporary parenting and professional\/public engagement\u000a    In the UK the findings from Miller's research relating to aspects of\u000a      parenting have led to professional and public engagement activities e.g.\u000a      talks to practitioner audiences and groups providing antenatal services to\u000a      men (e.g. the National Childbirth Trust, Oxford Mental Health services) as\u000a      well as invited commentary pieces in Midwifery practitioner journals (e.g.\u000a      `Maternal spheres: what are we doing with men?' The Practising\u000a        Midwife, January 2013). Her research monographs [1 and 3] are\u000a      recommended as `key texts' by the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) [10],\u000a      the largest parenting charity in the UK and both are used in preparation\u000a      classes for prospective parents and used as training materials in\u000a      professional development by NCT practitioners. Miller's research has also\u000a      been used in the design of a current national NCT survey on Transition to\u000a      Parenthood (2013) and her appointment as an advisor to the project [11].\u000a      She has also contributed as an invited expert to a Guardian\u000a      roundtable discussion on how to involve men more effectively in\u000a      childbirth, leading to a newspaper article in 2012 [12]. Her\u000a      research findings are also used by the think tank, the Fatherhood\u000a      Institute reaching a wide public via their online presence [13].\u000a    Miller's research has successfully combined academic rigour with a focus\u000a      on micro-level processes in family lives through periods of transition and\u000a      the resulting findings have resonance in policy, health and public spheres\u000a      and resulting from this Miller has been invited to engage a wide range of\u000a      audiences. In the post 2008 period her research findings have received\u000a      national\/international media recognition including personal invitations to\u000a      discuss aspects of the research on BBC Breakfast TV (July and September,\u000a      2013) and the Australian Morning Television Show (April 2011). BBC Radio 4\u000a      `Woman's Hour' have also carried three programmes related to the research\u000a      findings between 2008 and 2013 on topics of maternal ambivalence,\u000a      father-baby bonding and fathers experiences of birth [14]. The research\u000a      findings regularly receive `popular' media attention (e.g. The Sunday\u000a      Times, February 2011) and have also been used in an award winning play\u000a      `Mum's The Word' [15]. Popular dissemination of her research recently led\u000a      to her selection for the inaugural BBC female expert scheme (2013) [16]\u000a      and on-going meetings with a production company who want to produce a\u000a      programme based on her research monograph `Making Sense of Fatherhood'.\u000a      Other invitations have included Miller presenting her research findings on\u000a      fatherhood to the Labour Policy Review group at the House of Commons\u000a      (February 2013) and giving the opening keynote lecture at the Museum of\u000a      Motherhood in New York (May 2013).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact described involves significant contributions to international\u000a      and national policy development and practitioner\/public engagement,\u000a      emanating from the findings of longitudinal qualitative research on\u000a      parenthood transitions, gender and caring. These findings have influenced\u000a      international policy evidenced though advisory roles and policy\u000a      development at the World Health Organisation and national policy through\u000a      engagement with think tanks, public\/practitioner bodies (e.g. National\u000a      Childbirth Trust) and membership of a Labour party policy review panel on\u000a      fatherhood.

Using qualitative longitudinal (QL) research two\u000a      major consecutive and comparative studies have been undertaken by\u000a      Professor Miller during the past 15 years. The first of these, `Making\u000a        Sense of Motherhood' (1998 - 2005) has been foundational in mapping\u000a      the gendered terrain of contemporary family lives and women's experiences\u000a      of first-time motherhood, drawing on issues of reproductive health and\u000a      socio-cultural factors which shape individual experiences and broader\u000a      societal assumptions. This study provided the empirical foundation and\u000a      design for the second major project `Making Sense of Fatherhood' (2006 - 2013)\u000a\u0009  which has examined men's unfolding experiences of transition to\u000a      first-time parenthood alongside caring and paid-work experiences and\u000a      practices. These two QL studies have contributed to Miller's\u000a      internationally recognised expertise on gender, policy and the ways in\u000a      which micro-processes shape individual and socio-cultural understandings\u000a      and family practices and the findings have been used in policy review,\u000a      public debate and service development.\u000a    Miller's first QL study on women's experiences of transition to\u000a      first-time motherhood led to various publications including the\u000a      best-selling, monograph `Making Sense of Motherhood: A Narrative\u000a        Approach' published by Cambridge University Press in 2005 [1]. This\u000a      research was predated by a study on antenatal service use by Bangladeshi\u000a      women living in Oxford, which marks the beginning of Miller's research\u000a      interests in gender, reproduction, socio-cultural factors and parenting\u000a      [2, 5]. The data for the major QL motherhood study was collected in the\u000a      late 1990's and focused on social and cultural dimensions of transition to\u000a      motherhood experiences. The findings revealed the disjunctions between\u000a      individual experiences at different points during transition and\u000a      public\/health discourses and practices and socio-cultural expectations.\u000a      The gap between essentialist societal assumptions that women `naturally'\u000a      knew how to mother and women's own experiences that mothering skills had\u000a      to be learned was a major finding subsequently influencing health visitor\u000a      practice. The motherhood research has since been complimented by a major\u000a      qualitative longitudinal study on men's experiences of transition to\u000a      fatherhood leading to significant outputs in the post 2008 period. The key\u000a      findings from this QL study were published in 2010 by Cambridge University\u000a      Press in `Making Sense of Fatherhood: Gender, Caring and Work'\u000a      [3], which has become a bestselling text. The findings from this research\u000a      study have highlighted the differences and points of overlap, in men's and\u000a      women's experiences of transition to parenthood. In particular it has\u000a      illuminated in subtle and more overt ways how gender shapes expectations\u000a      and practices in relation to individual experiences and societal\u000a      assumptions. The findings show how men's capacities to develop and\u000a      practice caring skills are similar to those of mothers, but that men have\u000a      more choices available to them in regard to the roles they can adopt as\u000a      fathers [4]. Across the studies the complexities of how gender operates to\u000a      shape intentions and apparent `choices' is laid bare and has provided\u000a      evidence of why generic policies which appeal to `parents' rather than\u000a      individually identifying `mothers' and `fathers' have not been successful\u000a      [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13848","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The substantive content of their research products and collaborative\u000d\u000a      relationships with public and private end users led to DCDC offering a\u000d\u000a      consultancy contract for assistance in the drafting of a new UK Joint\u000d\u000a      Intelligence Doctrine. Davies and Gustafson were members of the principal\u000d\u000a      intelligence doctrine drafting team and the executive-level Steering\u000d\u000a      Committee on Intelligence Doctrine, informing the doctrine with their\u000d\u000a      research on intelligence organizations and practices, and providing\u000d\u000a      critical and analytical approaches to the doctrine formulation and writing\u000d\u000a      processes.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on UK Professional Practices\u000d\u000a    1. Improved leadership: Davies' and Gustafson's\u000d\u000a      research prompted the creation of a new higher-level \"capstone\" doctrine &#8212;\u000d\u000a      the JDP 04 Understanding. JPD 04 Understanding is directed\u000d\u000a      towards operational commanders and leaders across government and\u000d\u000a      articulates how intelligence and other sources of information feed into a\u000d\u000a      leader's understanding of allies, adversaries, neutral partners,\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisations and others in an operational environment.\u000d\u000a      The doctrine defines \"understanding\" as \"the ability to place knowledge in\u000d\u000a      its wider context to provide us with options for decision-making.\" (Key\u000d\u000a        Findings [KFs] 1, 2, 4; Corroborating Sources [CS] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\u000d\u000a    2. Enhanced communication: The Intelligence process\u000d\u000a      was historically articulated through the `intelligence cycle' model that\u000d\u000a      was often seen by practitioners as a rigid process. Following\u000d\u000a      recommendations by Davies and Gustafson the doctrine team reformulated the\u000d\u000a      intelligence process as a network called `the core functions of\u000d\u000a      intelligence'. This approach has brought the schema more closely into line\u000d\u000a      with real-world intelligence practice and is a fundamental change in how\u000d\u000a      intelligence is understood, practiced and taught amongst practitioners. (KF\u000a        5; CS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\u000d\u000a    3. Improved understanding of the human factors\u000d\u000a        affecting enemy behaviour: Experience in Iraq and Afghanistan showed\u000d\u000a      HMG the importance of understanding local cultures, politics, economics,\u000d\u000a      legal structures and the environment, but this was not incorporated into\u000d\u000a      doctrine in a systematic way. To reflect these ideas the team mapped core\u000d\u000a      concepts of sociological theory into doctrinal terms as a scheme called\u000d\u000a      the `human domain framework' which became the central concept in the\u000d\u000a      doctrine on `understanding.' (KF 3, 4, 5, 6; CS 1, 2, 3, 5)\u000d\u000a    4: The UK MoD defines doctrine as \"that which is taught\".\u000d\u000a      Accordingly, Intelligence personnel training and orientation programmes\u000d\u000a      across government have changed to incorporate both the new intelligence\u000d\u000a      and understanding doctrines, showing influence on professional standards\u000d\u000a      and guidelines for training. The curriculum at the Defence Intelligence\u000d\u000a      and Security Centre at Chicksands has been revised to employ these\u000d\u000a      doctrines, and DISC is the principal cross-government as well as MoD\u000d\u000a      training centre for intelligence practitioners.(CS 5)\u000d\u000a    5: The concepts of `understanding' and the `human domain\u000d\u000a      framework' are doctrinal expressions of core concepts from sociological\u000d\u000a      theory that have led to professional bodies such as the Defence Geographic\u000d\u000a      Centre in Feltham incorporating the concepts via new mapping products\u000d\u000a      detailing \"human domain\" issues graphically, enhancing their \"ability to\u000d\u000a      present the case for developing human geography, as it demonstrated the\u000d\u000a      need to consider the interrelationships between dimensions and disciplines\u000d\u000a      that are all too often worked in isolation.\" (KF 3, 4, 5, 6; CS 7).\u000d\u000a    6: Practitioner internal debate was further informed by\u000d\u000a      BCISS organisational work through an ESRC Seminar Series on `Intelligence\u000d\u000a      and Government in the 21st Century' in 2008-9 that included\u000d\u000a      former heads of the Government Communications Headquarters and over twenty\u000d\u000a      other intelligence and policy analysts from throughout HMG. Amongst the\u000d\u000a      outputs of the ESRC series was a special issue of the journal Public\u000d\u000a        Policy and Administration on `Intelligence and Public Management' to\u000d\u000a      which two GCHQ heads as well as Davies (Ref. 3) contributed. This\u000d\u000a      series contributed to practitioner awareness of BCISS research and to the\u000d\u000a      Doctrine consultancy.\u000d\u000a    International Impacts on Practices and Debates\u000d\u000a    7. This research has informed international practitioner\u000d\u000a      debates as both the \"Intelligence\" and \"Understanding\" doctrine have\u000d\u000a      \"exercised significant... influence over our [US\/Can\/Aus\/NZ] partners.\"\u000d\u000a      The new UK intelligence doctrine is also to be used as a point of\u000d\u000a      departure for a new, revised NATO intelligence doctrine.(CS 5, 7)\u000d\u000a    8: The use of these two doctrines by British forces engaged\u000d\u000a      in `mentoring' allied defence communities in countries such as Afghanistan\u000d\u000a      has changed practice for specific groups (the Afghan MoI), and influenced\u000d\u000a      professional standards. To this end Gustafson served as intelligence\u000d\u000a      advisor and mentor to the Afghan Ministry of Interior between September\u000d\u000a      2012 and May 2013, where \"application of JDP 2-00 concepts specifically on\u000d\u000a      the intelligence cycle had a marked positive effect on the function of the\u000d\u000a      Afghan MoI police intelligence apparatus.\"(CS 5)\u000d\u000a    9: Subsequent impact includes changed professional\u000d\u000a      practices in the US, as the US Military Intelligence doctrine will adopt\u000d\u000a      components of the `human domain framework' (see Impact 3) from UK\u000d\u000a      doctrine.(CS 5)\u000d\u000a    10: The work has influenced professional guidance and\u000d\u000a      training at the European Union External Actions Services Intelligence\u000d\u000a      Centre where in December 2012 Davies provided a training package, `the\u000d\u000a      Intelligence Analysis', which partly used as its basis JDP 2-00 and JDP 04\u000d\u000a      and drew directly on BCISS research and the KFs discussed above. The\u000d\u000a      training was \"considered compulsory for staff\" and included students from\u000d\u000a      IntCen, EU Military Staff Intelligence Directorate and the EU Satellite\u000d\u000a      Centre.

Brunel Centre for\u000d\u000a      Intelligence and Security Studies (BCISS) scholars Davies (Senior Lecturer\u000d\u000a      and Director of BCISS; now Professor) and Gustafson (Lecturer) have\u000d\u000a      addressed this gap by applying theories of order, organisation and\u000d\u000a      institution-building from sociology, political science, management and\u000d\u000a      business studies to the study of intelligence institutions and processes\u000d\u000a      during the 20th and 21st centuries.\u000d\u000a    This approach was pioneered by Davies in his doctoral work (Ref.1)\u000d\u000a      and further developed in a research project on the comparative analysis of\u000d\u000a      national intelligence in the UK and USA, funded by a Leverhulme Research\u000d\u000a      Fellowship in 2004-5 resulting in Refs. 2, 3&amp; 4)\u000d\u000a      Gustafson joined BCISS in 2007. His article on horizon scanning (Ref. 5)\u000d\u000a      was the result of a secondment with the UK Cabinet Office Horizon Scanning\u000d\u000a      Unit in 2009. During that secondment the Cabinet Office requested research\u000d\u000a      be undertaken on the organisation and role of horizon scanning (the\u000d\u000a      systematic examination of potential threats, opportunities and likely\u000d\u000a      future developments) within Her Majesty's Government. He subsequently\u000d\u000a      received a two-year British Academy Small Grant which further developed\u000d\u000a      the analysis of interagency intelligence management [Ref. 6].\u000d\u000a    Key findings (KFs) from their research underlying the\u000d\u000a      Doctrine project include:\u000d\u000a    KF1: The conduct and organisation of intelligence\u000d\u000a      operations are fundamentally shaped by basic concepts of what intelligence\u000d\u000a      is that vary between states and&#8212;within states&#8212;between civilians and armed\u000d\u000a      services, and can create problems for international and inter-agency\u000d\u000a      collaboration and communication. (Refs 1, 3, 5)\u000d\u000a    KF2: Horizon scanning methodologies and structured\u000d\u000a      analytical techniques can contribute towards harmonizing the understanding\u000d\u000a      of intelligence across governments and in inter-agency contexts by\u000d\u000a      providing a common language for cooperation. (Ref 5)\u000d\u000a    KF3: Practitioner perceptions of how intelligence\u000d\u000a      institutions operate are deeply conditioned by corporate orthodoxies and\u000d\u000a      conventions which do not always match reality. Social and organizational\u000d\u000a      theory can help practitioners understand how their own agencies work, a KF\u000d\u000a      that proved central to reformation of the \"intelligence cycle\". (Refs\u000d\u000a        1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\u000d\u000a    KF4: Intelligence organisations are more akin to high-tech\u000d\u000a      firms than state bureaucracies in terms of their environments and internal\u000d\u000a      operation, with the implication that reform and refinement of professional\u000d\u000a      practice needs to reflect this (Refs 1, 3, 4).\u000d\u000a    KF5: Intelligence institutions have organisational cultures\u000d\u000a      that are amalgams of wider organisational and political cultures where\u000d\u000a      intelligence collection and analysis often clash with embedded cultures,\u000d\u000a      conventions and preferences of their policy and political counterparts in\u000d\u000a      government. (Refs 1, 3, 5)\u000d\u000a    KF6: Intelligence institutions and processes need to be\u000d\u000a      understood realistically in terms of wider, underlying\u000d\u000a      sociological\/social-theoretical concepts of order, institutionalisation\u000d\u000a      and conduct. This provides a basis for the concept of \"Understanding\"\u000d\u000a      incorporated in the doctrine.(Refs 1, 2, 5, 6)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13849","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Fisher's research has contributed to the impact through comparative\u000a      analyses of the effects of regulations and the desirability of pursuing\u000a      statutory or self-regulation. Corroborating sources are detailed in\u000a      Section 5 (S5.1-S5.23)\u000a    UK\u000a    Shaping Policy Recommendations\u000a    \u000a      Finding 1 (F1) was submitted directly to the Committee on\u000a        Standards in Public Life by Fisher in his capacity as an advisor (S5.8,\u000a        S5.11). This research persuaded the Committee that public opinion\u000a        should not be seen as an obstacle to recommending an extension of state\u000a        funding and, thereby, was of significance in shaping the Committee's\u000a        2011 report on party finance, most especially in its acceptance and\u000a        advancement of this conclusion (Ref1 &#8212; subsequently published in\u000a        2013). The Committee notes that this `was a particularly difficult\u000a        recommendation to make but Professor Fisher's work provided hard\u000a        evidence to justify making the recommendation' (S5.18). The\u000a        final report (S5.11) cited some 11 additional outputs by Fisher.\u000a        Fisher's position as advisor to the committee also allowed him to draw\u000a        on data and findings from ESRC and Electoral Commission funded studies\u000a        of constituency campaigning to inform discussions about the relative\u000a        impact of finance and voluntary work on constituency level campaigning (F5,\u000a        Ref5, S5.11, S5.17).\u000a      Finding 3 (F3) contributed to the dropping of `triggering' from\u000a        the Political Parties and Elections Bill following Fisher's appearance\u000a        at the Public Bill Committee (S5.3, S5.10). Fisher's work\u000a        on electoral agents (S5.1) showed how there had been significant\u000a        confusion over the regulation of candidate expenses. Given the high\u000a        proportion of voluntary agents and their relative inexperience, the\u000a        proposal risked imposing an unreasonable burden on party activists as\u000a        well as being almost impossible to regulate effectively (Ref5).\u000a      Fisher's research provided important information for the Electoral\u000a        Commission on the understanding of electoral procedures and the\u000a        perceived quality of information provided to candidates through ESRC and\u000a        Electoral Commission-funded studies of election agents in 2010 (S5.4).\u000a        An end of award rapporteur described this as `an excellent example of\u000a        cutting edge social science which speaks successfully to the policy\u000a        world as well as to the academy' (S5.19). The Chief Executive\u000a        notes that this work informed the Commission's statutory work on the\u000a        2010 election and that Fisher's wider research was used to `help sense\u000a        check our policy assumptions, analysis and positions....In short,\u000a        Professor Fisher's research has played an important role in the\u000a        development of party and election finance policy' (F2-F5,\u000a        Ref1, Ref2, Ref3, Ref4, Ref5, S5.1,\u000a        S5.2, S5.4, S5.20).\u000a      Findings 3 and 4 (F3, F4) influenced the Public\u000a        Administration Select Committee's report on the regulation of lobbying\u000a        (for whom Fisher was the Special Advisor), both through work conducted\u000a        on behalf of the committee on the comparative regulation of lobbying,\u000a        but particularly through previous work on party finance regulation (Ref\u000a          3, Ref 4). The parallels with political finance reform are\u000a        very apparent &#8212; both are areas of voluntary political activity with\u000a        discussions about lobbying reform mirroring those in party finance,\u000a        prior to the 2000 Act. The committee reports that Fisher's research\u000a        informed their view on lobbying through the `clear evidence of the\u000a        perverse impacts that over-regulation could produce in a comparative\u000a        context' (S5.21). Subsequently, Fisher contributed to practice\u000a        change by acting as a member of the Working Party to establish the UK\u000a        Public Affairs Council, set up following the report by the Select\u000a        Committee (2009) (S5.12).\u000a    \u000a    Stimulating Debate, Improving Public Understanding and Challenging\u000a        Conventional Wisdom\u000a    Fisher's key findings (F1-F5) and wider research have\u000a      impacted on several stakeholders by stimulating debate, improving public\u000a      understanding and challenging conventional wisdom.\u000a    \u000a      Fisher presented to senior management from the Electoral Commission on\u000a        the implications for the Commission of a change of government (2009),\u000a        based on the content and scenario planning methodology in Ref 6.\u000a      Fisher appeared before the Scottish Affairs Select Committee (S5.5)\u000a        to deliver evidence in respect of the campaign finance issues associated\u000a        with the referendum on separation for Scotland (2012). This drew on both\u000a        Fisher's detailed understanding of the relevant legislation (Ref2,\u000a        Ref3, Ref4) and on the relative impact of election\u000a        spending and voluntary activity (Ref5).\u000a      Fisher appeared before the Speaker's Conference on Parliamentary\u000a        Representation (2009) (S5.9) to deliver evidence on the case for\u000a        using state funding of political parties to encourage representative\u000a        diversity (Ref2, Ref4)\u000a      Fisher appeared before the Political and Constitutional Reform Select\u000a        Committee to deliver evidence on regulation of lobbying (2012, S5.6)\u000a        drawing on Ref2, Ref3, Ref4, and the oversight\u000a        of the Parliamentary Constituencies and Voting System Bill (2010) (S5.7)\u000a      Fisher made two invited presentations in Parliament on party finance\u000a        based on his research findings in Ref3 and Ref4 and those\u000a        subsequently published in Ref2 &#8212; to the Associate Parliamentary\u000a        Group on Constitution, Parliament and Citizenship and to the Parliament\u000a        and Constitution Centre Seminar (2008).\u000a      During the review period, Fisher appeared on Sky News on\u000a        sixteen occasions, the BBC Westminster Hour eight times, BBC\u000a        television four times, ITV, Channel 4 and GMTV nine times, and various\u000a        BBC radio stations on seven occasions. His cited remarks are regularly\u000a        syndicated via Reuters or Bloomberg.\u000a      Fisher's research has been used to improve understanding on party\u000a        finance in the legal profession. He published detailed annotations of\u000a        the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009 drawing on Ref2, Ref3,\u000a        Ref4 in Current Law Statutes Annotated, used widely by\u000a        practicing lawyers (S5.16).\u000a    \u000a    Training\u000a    \u000a      Whilst retained as a policy advisor for the Electoral Commission,\u000a        Fisher delivered a training session for newly recruited staff on\u000a        political parties and campaigning.\u000a    \u000a    Georgia, Poland and the Czech Republic:\u000a    Shaping Policy Recommendations\u000a    \u000a      Fisher's research findings (F1-F5) (Ref1, Ref2,\u000a        Ref3, Ref4, Ref5) shaped policy recommendations\u000a        in the Council of Europe reviews of party finance in Poland and the\u000a        Czech Republic (Scientific Expert 2008-11). The Council of Europe\u000a        confirms that that Fisher's analyses and contributions were `essential\u000a        for the preparation of the corresponding Evaluation Reports' which were\u000a        adopted in December 2008 (Poland S5.13) and April 2011 (Czech\u000a        Republic S5.14). In the eight recommendations made in the Polish\u000a        report, the Council of Europe concluded in its compliance report that by\u000a        December 2010, six had been partly implemented in the framework of the\u000a        preparation of a new draft Electoral Code (S5.22).\u000a      Fisher's research findings (F1-F5) (Ref1, Ref2,\u000a        Ref3, Ref4, Ref5) shaped policy recommendations\u000a        in the Council of Europe review of party finance in Georgia, requested\u000a        by the Georgian Ministry of Justice. Fisher reviewed existing regulation\u000a        and practice, met several times with key stakeholders, including the\u000a        Ministry of Justice, the advisor to the Prime Minister, the State Audit\u000a        Office, the political parties and civil society groups and made\u000a        recommendations for policy change (S5.15). The Council of Europe\u000a        concluded that the report and discussions `raised the knowledge of\u000a        stakeholders of the possible drawbacks and benefits of certain\u000a        regulatory approaches, leading to better-informed draft amendments to\u000a        the existing legislation'. It further commented that that `Professor\u000a        Fisher's recommendations were clearly informed by his academic research\u000a        and his ability to draw on and analyse experiences of other countries\u000a        contributed to the weight given to his report and the acceptance of his\u000a        recommendations' (S5.23).\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Fisher's research on the regulation of party finance and lobbying has\u000a      produced considerable impact on British government agencies, Parliament,\u000a      the Council of Europe, the Georgian government and key media providers.\u000a      The research has influenced policy and practice through comparative\u000a      analyses of the effects of regulations in party finance and lobbying and\u000a      the desirability of pursuing statutory or self-regulation.

Democracies\u000a      must also seek to ensure that any regulation designed to deliver these\u000a      demands can be implemented and operated effectively. This is important\u000a      because it influences both the effective operation of democratic\u000a      activities like elections, as well as confidence in the probity and\u000a      effectiveness of these activities &#8212; both by political actors and citizens.\u000a    The underpinning research primarily focuses on political finance and the\u000a      attempts to regulate it. Prior to the Political Parties, Elections\u000a        &amp; Referendums Act 2000, British political finance was largely\u000a      unregulated. Despite the extensive nature of these reforms which came into\u000a      force in 2001, there have been major reviews of the regulations by the\u000a      Ministry of Justice (the Hayden Phillips review), and during the review\u000a      period, the Committee on Standards in Public Life. Fisher was an advisor\u000a      on both. Fisher's research has focussed on the drivers for reform, the\u000a      impact and consequences of regulations, and the practicalities and\u000a      desirability of their enforcement.\u000a    Fisher's work on party finance dates back many years (his first\u000a      publication in the field being in 1992). However, the key works on the\u000a      regulation of political activity date from 2000 during the passage of the\u000a      Political Parties, Elections &amp; Referendums Act.\u000a    The key findings are empirically informed using, where applicable,\u000a      specially collected datasets on public opinion, trends in party finance,\u000a      attitudes of electoral agents, and trends and patterns in constituency\u000a      level campaigning. They challenge several accepted norms in the party\u000a      finance literature and provide key policy pointers:\u000a    F1. that public opinion may not be a good guide to sustainable\u000a      reform in an area of low knowledge and understanding (Ref 1);\u000a    F2. that underlying normative and historical institutions are key\u000a      drivers of both policy choices and the practicalities of implementation (Ref2,\u000a      Ref4, Ref6);\u000a    F3. that regulation of political finance should be mindful of the\u000a      potential damage to political parties and wider political activity should\u000a      regulation be too extensive (Ref2, Ref3, Ref4, Ref5);\u000a    F4. that regulations can produce unintended consequences, and that\u000a      regulators must recognise that they will be unable to anticipate all\u000a      consequences (Ref3, Ref4);\u000a    F5. that the impact of disparities in party spending on electoral\u000a      success can be tempered by free, voluntary efforts at the time of\u000a      elections (Ref5).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15520","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"285570","Name":"Kuwait"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The team built close working relationships with the UK regulatory bodies\u000a      to ensure that the\u000a      research insights fed directly back into the work of these bodies, helping\u000a      them to achieve greater\u000a      institutional credibility [C1]. Research findings and draft papers\u000a      were often shared with regulatory\u000a      bodies. The Director of the Institute for Government, a senior participant\u000a      in the process,\u000a      commented that the team's work \"is a model of the interaction and\u000a      influence of political scientists\u000a      with practitioners, in making an impact on important public policy issues\"\u000a      [C2]. The research\u000a      directly contributed to better definitions of the seven principles in\u000a      public life, it helped to identify\u000a      best practice in regulation, shaped the Independent Parliamentary\u000a      Standards Authority's approach\u000a      to regulation, and contributed to the wider public debate.\u000a    a) Contributing to Better Definitions of the Seven\u000a          Principles of Public Life\u000a      Philp has worked closely with the Committee on Standards in Public Life\u000a      (CSPL) since 2001. On\u000a      the basis of his research, he was appointed to the newly established\u000a      Research Advisory Board of\u000a      the CSPL in 2002 to direct the Committee's research and has chaired the\u000a      Board since 2008\u000a      (running its biennial survey of public attitudes from 2008 to 2012).\u000a    The CSPL is a governmental body\u000a      that is tasked with examining concerns about standards of\u000a      conduct among public\u000a        office holders, including financial and commercial activities, and\u000a      to\u000a      recommend changes to ensure the highest standards of propriety. In 2002,\u000a      based on his research\u000a      [R2], Philp wrote a conceptual paper for the Committee, The\u000a        Seven Principles: What they say and\u000a        what they mean [C3], which identified tensions in the principles and\u000a      argued that the CSPL should\u000a      conduct research on the understanding of the principles by the public and\u000a      office holders. Philp was\u000a      closely involved in the research, which was conducted in 2005-6. He\u000a      provided detailed advice,\u000a      helped design the topic guide for the focus groups, attended groups as an\u000a      observer on behalf of\u000a      the Committee, and liaised with the research company in the writing of the\u000a      final report. The report\u000a      recommended that several of the descriptors of the principles be changed\u000a      to reflect more\u000a      adequately the public's understandings of the terms.\u000a    Before 2012, change was inopportune, but, in 2012, Philp brought the\u000a      report and his own research\u000a      [R2] to the attention of the (largely renewed) Committee as it\u000a      worked on its 14th Report \"Standards\u000a        Matter: a review of best practice in promoting good behaviour in public\u000a        life\" (Jan 2013) [C4]. Philp\u000a      contributed particularly to the Report's Chapter 3 on the seven principles\u000a      (which cites Philp's paper\u000a      [C3, C4]), and stressed the importance of defining the principles\u000a      in terms that make sense equally\u000a      to members of the public and those in public office. The Report introduced\u000a      several changes in the\u000a      descriptors broadly following the research. For instance, `honesty' is now\u000a      expressly defined as\u000a      being truthful, rather than in relation to conflicts of interest. The\u000a      seven principles and their new\u000a      descriptors provide the basic template for codes of conduct throughout the\u000a      UK public sector,\u000a      applying to all elected and appointed officials.\u000a    b) Helping to Identify Best Practice in Regulation\u000a      Hine has also worked closely with the CSPL [C5]. His research on\u000a      accountability mechanisms and\u000a      regulatory regimes, their positive and potentially distortive effects, and\u000a      the relationship between UK\u000a      concerns and the wider international context, helped to inform Chapter 6\u000a      (\"Ethical Regulation\") of\u000a      the 14th Report of the CSPL, \"Standards Matter: a review of\u000a        best practice in promoting good\u000a        behaviour in public life\" (Jan 2013) [C4]. Hine contributed\u000a      key insights from the team's research,\u000a      and also provided access to draft material from the team's on-going study\u000a      of attitudes by first-time\u000a      MPs to the regulation regime, which is cited in the report [C6].\u000a      The report was later accepted by\u000a      the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and included in her annual\u000a      report to Parliament in\u000a      July 2013.\u000a    In the same period, Hine contributed a substantial memorandum (and Peele\u000a      also gave evidence)\u000a      to the Cabinet Office Review of the CSPL in 2012 [C7]. Hine's\u000a      analysis and Peele's evidence,\u000a      which drew on their broader research on regulation, was extensively\u000a      quoted in the Review [C8, pp.\u000a        5, 8, 9, 11, 13] and informed several of its recommendation that the\u000a      CSPL should steer a less\u000a      controversial, more strategic and effective course.\u000a    c) Shaping the Independent Parliamentary Standard\u000a          Authority's Approach to Regulation\u000a      Hine and Peele have also worked closely with Independent Parliamentary\u000a      Standards Authority\u000a      (IPSA). IPSA &#8212; established in 2009 in the wake of the MPs expenses scandal\u000a      &#8212; was viewed by\u000a      many MPs as a controversial innovation. As the regulator was working\u000a      through a series of\u000a      difficulties in its relationship with Parliament and public opinion, the\u000a      IPSA CEO asked Hine and\u000a      Peele to provide research-based advice to enable senior IPSA staff to\u000a      achieve a greater\u000a      understanding of the wider context of public ethics and to facilitate\u000a      inter-agency communication.\u000a      Hine participated in IPSA's Panel of Experts, and Hine and Peele organized\u000a      a series of seminars\u000a      for senior IPSA staff [C9]. These seminars drew directly on the\u000a      team's research to discuss:\u000a      alliance-building strategies to secure more effective links between IPSA\u000a      and stake-holders in\u000a      promoting acceptance of the new standards; regulator accountability\u000a      (assessing the\u000a      appropriateness of the accountability IPSA had hitherto been subject to\u000a      from (i) the Public\u000a      Accounts Committee, (ii) the Speaker's Committee for the Independent\u000a      Parliamentary Standards\u000a      Authority, and (iii) the specially-constituted Parliamentary Select\u000a      Committee); pay and pensions;\u000a      and the draft Green Paper on MPs' conditions, prepared for publication in\u000a      December 2012.\u000a    The research, together with initial findings from Hine's research on\u000a      attitudes of first-time MPs,\u000a      helped IPSA's senior management to better understand the wider context of\u000a      UK ethics regulation\u000a      and the importance of institutional alliance-building. The team's central\u000a      research finding &#8212; that\u000a      ethics regulators need sensitivity to the complexities of their\u000a      institutional location and selective\u000a      alliances with their stakeholders and with other regulators to be\u000a      effective and independent &#8212; has\u000a      helped inform IPSA's approach to policies on the regulation of MPs'\u000a      business costs and expenses,\u000a      and in particular, the determination of MPs' pay and pensions [C9].\u000a    d) Shaping the international debate on ethical standards in\u000a          public life\u000a      Political ethics is an area of growing importance to governments around\u000a      the world and the group's\u000a      work is shaping debate beyond the UK. Hine has been invited to present his\u000a      findings on regulation\u000a      and standards to legislators in Kuwait (May 2012) and to three successive\u000a      delegations of Indian\u000a      parliamentarians to Oxford (under UKFCO sponsorship). He continues to\u000a      collaborate with\u000a      members of the Ethics Committee of the Indian lower house (Lok Sabha), in\u000a      revising its rules for\u000a      registering financial interests and in drafting its first code of conduct.\u000a      Philp is a registered expert\u000a      with the Council of Europe and has acted as a consultant on projects\u000a      concerning corruption, ethical\u000a      regulation and risk assessment with reference to Central and Eastern\u000a      European States [C10].\u000a    Clear and effective standards in public life are central in protecting\u000a      the public interest, sustaining\u000a      the legitimacy of the wider political system, and in building public\u000a      trust. The team's work in this\u000a      complex area of public life has contributed to the clarity of standards\u000a      and is enabling regulators in\u000a      the UK and beyond to adopt approaches that command support and compliance\u000a      from the\u000a      institutions that they regulate.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Ethics regulation across UK institutions has undergone two decades of\u000a      rapid change and has\u000a      sometimes resulted in fragile, controversial and difficult regulatory\u000a      processes. Research by Hine,\u000a      Peele and Philp has given rise to a better understanding of the conditions\u000a      under which institutional\u000a      ethics regulation and standard setting is more likely to be effective.\u000a      Their findings have contributed\u000a      to the clarification of the ethical principles that guide the codes of\u000a      conduct in the UK public sector;\u000a      shaped the institutional strategies of regulators (in particular the\u000a      Committee on Standards in Public\u000a      Life and the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority); and\u000a      influenced international debate\u000a      on standards in public life.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    Oxford University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000aR1.

He systematically analysed the\u000a      meanings of the `seven\u000a      principles of public life' (selflessness, integrity, objectivity,\u000a      accountability, openness, honesty and\u000a      leadership) and identified ambiguities and tensions in their definition [Section\u000a        3: R1, R2].\u000a      Specifically, Philp showed that the definition of several principles was\u000a      not based on a shared\u000a      understanding of their meaning among the public and those in public\u000a      office, which gave rise to\u000a      significant risks: varying expectations and interpretations could threaten\u000a      the legitimacy of the\u000a      principles themselves and of the institutions they were designed to\u000a      regulate. The research pointed\u000a      to the need to rethink the formulation and descriptors of some of the\u000a      principles [R2].\u000a    b) Challenges in the Design of Regulatory Institutions\u000a      Hine and Philp's ESRC-funded comparative work on ethical values and public\u000a      management in\u000a      Western Europe (2001-3) explored the challenges in structuring effective\u000a      accountability\u000a      relationships [R2, R3, R4, R6]. The institutional studies that\u000a      resulted from this project showed that\u000a      building a regulatory regime requires careful definition of the values at\u000a      risk; accurate assessments\u000a      of the likely interaction between rules, enforcement, and public and media\u000a      opinion; sensitivity to the\u000a      consent that regulation is likely to obtain (given agent motivations,\u000a      incentives and status concerns);\u000a      and an awareness of how regulatory institutions relate to a country's\u000a      wider institutional framework.\u000a      The comparative work showed that European democracies address these issues\u000a      in different ways\u000a      and with distinct results.\u000a    The research also identified the distinctiveness of the UK's highly\u000a      self-regulatory and soft-law-\u000a      based approach compared to the public law traditions of continental Europe\u000a      and explored the\u000a      challenges to effective regulation that arise from the maintenance of that\u000a      particular type of public\u000a      culture. The research focussed especially on the complexities of conflict\u000a      of interest regulation, the\u000a      difficulties in establishing independent regulatory institutions in the\u000a      UK, and the vulnerability of\u000a      regulators to political challenge [R4, R5, R6]. All the major\u000a      regulators, the Electoral Commission\u000a      (EC), the Standards Board for England (SBE), the Advisory Committee on\u000a      Business Interests\u000a      (ACOBA), the Commissioner for Parliamentary Standards (CPS), the\u000a      Independent Adviser on\u000a      Ministerial Interests (IAMI), the Independent Parliamentary Standards\u000a      Authority (IPSA), and even\u000a      the Committee on Standards in Public Life (CSPL), have proved vulnerable\u000a      to political challenge.\u000a      In some cases (EC, IPSA), design problems flow from unresolved political\u000a      differences about scope\u000a      and mission, and the status of regulators has remained contested after\u000a      their establishment.\u000a      Vulnerabilities are most acute where regulation bears on the legislature\u000a      itself (CPS, IPSA), rather\u000a      than on others (such as ACOBA in its dealings with civil servants or the\u000a      EC). The research\u000a      demonstrated that when Parliament is the subject of regulatory proposals\u000a      (as in the case of the\u000a      CPS and IPSA), the reluctance to ensure adequate institutional separation\u000a      has produced hostility\u000a      amongst MPs to the checks and balances established [R6].\u000a    Philp showed that one major area of difficulty in crafting regulatory\u000a      regimes concerns the\u000a      relationship between political and formal accountability: While the\u000a      accountability of those in public\u000a      office is predicated upon them acting on their political judgement, the\u000a      attempt to impose formal\u000a      rules and regulatory systems potentially diminishes the role for judgment\u000a      and autonomy. This can\u000a      create perverse incentives, producing, for example, box-ticking and\u000a      formalistic attitudes. Effective\u000a      regulation depends on achieving acceptance of, and identification with,\u000a      the standards that are\u000a      proposed [R2].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"16771","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3277605","Name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Simms's work has served not only to inform policy-makers and\u000d\u000a      parliamentarians, but also to contribute to public awareness of a crucial\u000d\u000a      dimension of international politics, that of humanitarian intervention.\u000d\u000a      While his work has had particular resonance in debates about the Balkans,\u000d\u000a      it has also had a significant impact on thinking about the\u000d\u000a      responsibilities of governments to protect their own citizens, and in\u000d\u000a      certain circumstances those of other states.\u000d\u000a    The testimonials cited in Section 5 from senior practitioners inside and\u000d\u000a      outside the UK provide clear evidence for the claim that Simms' research\u000d\u000a      has had impact in policy-making circles For example the ex-Australian\u000d\u000a      Foreign Minister and Founder of the International Crisis Group says that\u000d\u000a      `Brendan Simms's book, and the debate that it generated, contributed\u000d\u000a      enormously to the perception among policy-makers in Europe and beyond that\u000d\u000a      terrible errors had been made in the Balkans, and to their determination\u000d\u000a      to ensure that experience was never repeated' (Source i).

He became a Reader in 2004 and\u000d\u000a      Professor of the History of International Relations in 2008.\u000d\u000a    The first phase, from 1998 on, focused on British policy during the\u000d\u000a      Bosnian War, involving a thorough study of documents in the public sphere,\u000d\u000a      extensive interviews with protagonists, and use of some released or leaked\u000d\u000a      formerly classified documents. The results of this research were published\u000d\u000a      in the monograph \"Unfinest Hour. Britain and the destruction of Bosnia\"\u000d\u000a      (ref i), as well as in other scholarly outputs (refs iv,v)\u000d\u000a      and disseminated through numerous journal and newspaper articles. The\u000d\u000a      research demonstrated that the UK government's reluctance to use military\u000d\u000a      force to end `ethnic cleansing' against (mainly) Bosnian Muslims was not\u000d\u000a      driven by any covert `Islamophobia' but derived from a `conservative\u000d\u000a      pessimism' about whether intervention was feasible and even intellectually\u000d\u000a      defensible. This mentality, associated with the general norm of\u000d\u000a      non-intervention enshrined in Article 2.7 of the United Nations Charter,\u000d\u000a      had been a powerful shaping force in British foreign policy from the\u000d\u000a      American civil war, through the Spanish civil war to the Biafran crisis of\u000d\u000a      the 1960s. Simms' research demonstrated the power of such thinking and its\u000d\u000a      consequences on the ground in an area for which Britain nonetheless had\u000d\u000a      accepted some responsibility. The work also suggested that this stance was\u000d\u000a      proving increasingly unsustainable in a world where a humanitarian\u000d\u000a      catastrophe within Europe was putting an impossible strain on alliance\u000d\u000a      cohesion within NATO and the European Union, partly through the heightened\u000d\u000a      concern of public opinion. It thus helped to develop an agenda with both\u000d\u000a      normative and empirical dimensions.\u000d\u000a    The second phase of the research, from c2004, involved a much broader\u000d\u000a      investigation of the historical roots of the concept of humanitarian\u000d\u000a      intervention, partly through detailed study of early modern and eighteenth\u000d\u000a      century British foreign policy, and partly through collaboration with\u000d\u000a      other scholars. This work showed that historically British policy makers\u000d\u000a      have frequently had to engage with humanitarian principles in foreign\u000d\u000a      policy making and indeed decisions on intervention. Their reactions have\u000d\u000a      depended on which strand of political thinking, and to a lesser extent\u000d\u000a      which party, was dominant at the time. Moreover, looking beyond the\u000d\u000a      British case to the European continent, and contrary to widespread popular\u000d\u000a      and political belief, the practice of humanitarian intervention was found\u000d\u000a      to have a long historical pedigree. Indeed, it became clear that the very\u000d\u000a      idea of a `Westphalian' international system in which intervention in the\u000d\u000a      internal affairs of sovereign states was forbidden, is a subsequent\u000d\u000a      invention by international lawyers rather than an historical fact (refs\u000d\u000a        ii, iii, vi).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"16775","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of the research is most directly evident in coalition\u000d\u000a      formation.

That this reflection is more than a coincidence is evident in the\u000d\u000a      explicit reference that trade negotiators make to this research.\u000d\u000a      Negotiators from key developing countries have &#8212; in their written works &#8212;\u000d\u000a      utilised and built on the research to better understand and implement\u000d\u000a      their coalition strategies. Instances include: (a) In 2008, a Mexican\u000d\u000a      trade negotiator utilised Narlikar's definitions and analysis of\u000d\u000a      coalitions to assess coalition performances of developing countries (see source\u000d\u000a        i, below); (b) In 2011, the South African Ambassador to the WTO\u000d\u000a      utilised Narlikar's research on coalitions as the basis for his assessment\u000d\u000a      of the NAMA-11 coalition's effectiveness (sources ii and iii); (c).\u000d\u000a      In 2012, a Brazilian diplomat cited Narlikar's analysis as having\u000d\u000a      influenced his view of multilateral negotiations processes (source iv).\u000d\u000a      He has since written that \"Dr Narlikar's analysis of coalitions and\u000d\u000a      multilateral negotiations in agriculture trade, particularly her insights\u000d\u000a      on power positions and coalition strategies and resilience, was\u000d\u000a      instrumental in giving theoretical understanding for the management of the\u000d\u000a      G-20 coalition led by Brazil and its strategy in the WTO Doha Round\u000d\u000a      negotiations\" (source v). Moreover the official history of the WTO\u000d\u000a      (published in 2013 with the backing of the Director-General of the\u000d\u000a      organization) cites and acknowledges Narlikar's work on coalitions and the\u000d\u000a      institution (source vi).\u000d\u000a    The indirect impact of the research has been to accord recognition to\u000d\u000a      coalitions in the WTO, thereby resulting in a striking turnaround from\u000d\u000a      policy from the days of the GATT and the early years of the WTO (when\u000d\u000a      coalition bargaining was referred to as an almost unseemly activity more\u000d\u000a      appropriate to the domain of the United Nations Conference on Trade and\u000d\u000a      Development &#8212; UNCTAD). Today coalitions form the heart of WTO diplomacy.\u000d\u000a      They find recognition on the official website where many are listed, and\u000d\u000a      also in Director General Pascal Lamy's \"concentric circles\" model of\u000d\u000a      decision-making where representatives of different groupings are included.\u000d\u000a      The responsiveness of the organization to coalitions is at least\u000d\u000a      indirectly influenced by this research, given that the coalitions\u000d\u000a      themselves have become more visible and effective by applying some of the\u000d\u000a      findings. Again, The History of the WTO acknowledges the relevance\u000d\u000a      and value of this analysis (source vi).\u000d\u000a    International organizations, particularly the WTO, have utilised the\u000d\u000a      findings of Phase 2 of the research. The first Warwick Commission on the\u000d\u000a      reform of the multilateral trading system utilized Narlikar's research and\u000d\u000a      also invited her to serve as a Commissioner (Report launched in December\u000d\u000a      2007, discussions of report in 2008). The resulting Warwick Commission\u000d\u000a      Report (source vii) has been widely cited by practitioners for its\u000d\u000a      recommendations as a realistic and optimistic way forward for the\u000d\u000a      multilateral trade negotiations. Two examples are worthy of note. Simon\u000d\u000a      Crean, the Australian Minister of Trade, in a speech to the Australian\u000d\u000a      Parliament, addressed the Report extensively while praising the\u000d\u000a      Commission's recommendations with explicit willingness to implement them (source\u000d\u000a        viii). Patrick Low, the WTO chief economist, has also used the\u000d\u000a      Report in a WTO working paper as a model for future decision-making in the\u000d\u000a      WTO (source ix). The official history of the WTO (source vi)\u000d\u000a      also cites Narlikar's work of 2006 and 2012 on the organization.\u000d\u000a    The third phase is also generating impact. The European Parliament\u000d\u000a      recently conducted an expert consultation on a different institutional\u000d\u000a      approach to resolving the current trade deadlock (in response to a US-led\u000d\u000a      attempt to facilitate a services \"plurilateral\"). Narlikar served as an\u000d\u000a      expert witness, and was asked particularly to focus on the response of the\u000d\u000a      rising powers to the alternative approach and suggest common ground for\u000d\u000a      compromise; the information gathered at the consultation is meant to help\u000d\u000a      formulate European Union positions and strategies at international trade\u000d\u000a      negotiations in May 2012 (source x). Furthermore, Narlikar's\u000d\u000a      analyses of institutional reform have been used as a reference point by\u000d\u000a      various organizations, reform commissions, NGOs, and professional training\u000d\u000a      programmes.\u000d\u000a    Related to this third phase are the activities of the Centre for Rising\u000d\u000a      Powers, an interdisciplinary research centre based at POLIS, with Narlikar\u000d\u000a      as the founding Director. A recent and on-going example of the impact of\u000d\u000a      the CRP research agenda on policy policy is Narlikar's discussion on the\u000d\u000a      potential establishment of a BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and\u000d\u000a      South Africa) Development Bank. The Financial Times in September\u000d\u000a      2012 (source xi) was among the first to rely on Narlikar's\u000d\u000a      expertise to assess this potentially ground-breaking cooperative bank\u000d\u000a      among rising powers. Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs, who was the first to\u000d\u000a      coin the acronym BRICs, has publicly acknowledged her foresight on this\u000d\u000a      issue (source xii).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Amrita Narlikar has made a systematic analysis of developing countries'\u000d\u000a      coalition and bargaining strategies in the General Agreement on Tariffs\u000d\u000a      and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) which has provided\u000d\u000a      practitioners with an analytic toolkit to navigate complex political\u000d\u000a      economy issues.

Her research goes back to 1996 and\u000d\u000a      has developed significantly during her time in Cambridge. It began as an\u000d\u000a      enquiry into a fundamental theoretical, empirical, and policy problem: how\u000d\u000a      do states choose their allies in international trade? Even though trade is\u000d\u000a      traditionally regarded as a positive-sum game, it is an area where\u000d\u000a      cooperation has proven difficult to achieve. The first phase of this\u000d\u000a      research (1996-2006; aspects of this research continue to date) focused on\u000d\u000a      bargaining coalitions of developing countries in the GATT and the WTO.\u000d\u000a      Unlike in some other international organizations, coalitions here did not\u000d\u000a      enjoy formal recognition, sometimes operating even as secret societies at\u000d\u000a      the time. The research provided a theoretical categorisation of\u000d\u000a      coalitions, and offered policy prescription on which types of coalition\u000d\u000a      strategies were likely to be most effective, especially for developing\u000d\u000a      countries, and why. The research findings, published as a book and several\u000d\u000a      papers, have stimulated a large and growing body of scholarship on\u000d\u000a      coalition and bargaining strategies in the trade regime as well as other\u000d\u000a      multilateral organizations\u000d\u000a    The second phase of this research (2004 - to date) took the author into a\u000d\u000a      study of the institution wherein these coalitions were operating i.e. the\u000d\u000a      WTO. Her works engaged with often heated public debates regarding\u000d\u000a      international trade and were frequently used as authoritative analytical\u000d\u000a      guides to shape such debates. It offered a case for free trade with\u000d\u000a      acknowledgements of the glaring institutional challenges in trade\u000d\u000a      governance (refs. i and ii). Her works are a primary reference\u000d\u000a      point for all scholars seeking to understand the WTO. Taken together, her\u000d\u000a      publications on this subject have raised questions about accountability,\u000d\u000a      legitimacy, fairness and power in the WTO.\u000d\u000a    Understanding the challenges of the multilateral trading system has been\u000d\u000a      enhanced by the third phase of this research (2007 - to date), pertaining\u000d\u000a      to multilateral deadlocks and power transition. Narlikar led an\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinary team to address the problem of deadlocks in multilateral\u000d\u000a      negotiations and offered a solution.

Since 2005 the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has made\u000a      the book mandatory reading for its diplomats (source [i]).\u000a    The impact of Chang's research is attested to by a range of sources: (i)\u000a      A developing country trade negotiator writes, \"Dr Chang's work directly\u000a      informs and empowers policy makers in developing countries by helping them\u000a      realise and understand the range of credible policy options available for\u000a      pursuing their development goals. With that knowledge and confidence they\u000a      can be better able to appreciate their situation and available options and\u000a      make more fully informed choices.\" (source [ii]); (ii) A senior\u000a      advisor at Oxfam writes, \"Ha-Joon Chang has been one of the most\u000a      influential heterodox critics of the orthodox thinking known as\u000a      `Washington Consensus'\" (source [iii]); (iii) A senior official at\u000a      the UN writes that he can \"testify both to the intellectual quality and\u000a      originality of Dr Chang's work, and to the considerable influence it has\u000a      had on a diverse range of policy issues critical to economic development.\u000a      I believe that Dr Chang is one of the most influential academic economists\u000a      in the area of international development policy-making\" (source [iv]).\u000a    The President of Ecuador since 2007, Rafael Correa, has made frequent\u000a      references to Chang's work, for example in his speech given at the LSE in\u000a      2009 (source [v]). Chang has been invited to speak on, and\u000a      occasionally produce reports on, trade and industrial policy issues. For\u000a      example, since 2008, he has been invited to speak and advise by the\u000a      governments of Brazil, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Korea,\u000a      Malaysia, Mexico, Namibia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Singapore, South\u000a      Africa, the UK, Uruguay, and Vietnam. The most prominent examples are the\u000a      Annual Presidential Lecture of Indonesia (May 2011: audience of around 100\u000a      people, comprising the president, the cabinet, regional governors and\u000a      other top policy-makers), three exclusive lectures to the President and\u000a      all cabinet members of Namibia (October 2011), and his address to the\u000a      annual board meeting of Khazanah, the Malaysia sovereign wealth fund,\u000a      chaired by the country's Prime Minister (December 2011).\u000a    Impact on the general public\u000a    Key themes that had previously been explored in Kicking Away the\u000a        Ladder and associated research were popularised in the book, Bad\u000a        Samaritans (2007). This was extended to include results from Chang's\u000a      broad study of institutions and markets, to produce a more extensive\u000a      critique of free market economics in 23 Things They Don't Tell You\u000a        About Capitalism (2010). These two books have presented\u000a      research-based challenges to conventional wisdom in public understanding\u000a      of economic issues. Since its publication in 2007, Bad Samaritans\u000a      has sold over 500,000 copies worldwide. It has been translated into 12\u000a      languages, with two more in the pipeline. 23 Things They Don't Tell\u000a        You About Capitalism has sold over 600,000 copies worldwide since\u000a      its publication in 2010. The book has been translated into 21 languages\u000a      and is awaiting 11 more (source [vi]). These two books together\u000a      have generated economic value of around &#163;11.5 million in sales (1.15\u000a      million copies, estimated roughly at &#163;10 per copy).\u000a    In addition to the above, Chang has written about his research findings\u000a      extensively in the mass media, especially in the UK and in Korea. In\u000a      particular, his columns in The Guardian, regular since the autumn\u000a      of 2011, have become some of the most popular ones in the Comments page of\u000a      the paper. A March 2013 piece, `Britain: A Nation in Decay', had an\u000a      extraordinary 1,682 readers' comments (with 2,176 Facebook shares) and was\u000a      for 24 hours the most read column in the paper's website (source [vii]).\u000a      Another article, `Europe is haunted by the myth of the lazy mob' (January\u000a      2013), had 4,156 Facebook shares (445 readers' comments), suggesting a\u000a      stronger response from younger and\/or international readers (source\u000a        [viii]). These are exceptional numbers, especially for economics\u000a      articles. Even the paper's most celebrated columnists writing on more\u000a      popular issues only occasionally get more than 1,000 readers' comments or\u000a      2,000 Facebook shares.\u000a    As a result of his research leading to his prominent engagement in\u000a      international policy debates and the high profile of his mass-market\u000a      books, Chang has had a very extensive media exposure worldwide &#8212; so far in\u000a      31 countries across all 5 occupied continents. Prominent examples since\u000a      2008 include op-ed pieces in top international newspapers, such as The\u000a        Financial Times (UK) (25 October, 2010; co-authored with Ilene\u000a      Grabel) and The Wall Street Journal (US) (7 August, 2011);\u000a      appearances in TV, including `Newsnight' on BBC 2 (UK) (24 September, 2010\u000a      and 28 October, 2011), Icelandic TV (Iceland) (10 September, 2012), and TV\u000a      Slovenia (Slovenia) (23 January, 2013); appearances in the BBC Radio 4\u000a      programme `Thinking Allowed' (3 May, 2010); interviews in premier\u000a      newspapers, including De Volkskrant (the Netherlands) (12\u000a      December, 2008 and 27 November, 2011), Valor Economico (Brazil)\u000a      (9-11 January weekend, 2009), Clarin (Argentina) (26 July, 2009), La\u000a        Jornada (Mexico) (4 December, 2009), Kathimerini (Greece) (8\u000a      August, 2010 and 5 January, 2013), Gazeta Wyborcza (Poland) (31\u000a      December, 2011 - 1 January, 2012), El Mundo (Spain) (14 January,\u000a      2012), O Estado de Sao Paulo (Brazil) (7 May, 2012 and 7 January,\u000a      2013), Handelsblatt (Germany) (22 October, 2012), Spiegel\u000a      (Germany) (3 January, 2013), and Dziennik Gazeta Prawna\u000a      (Poland) (8-10 February weekend, 2013); interviews in prominent magazines,\u000a      including Vice Versa (The Netherlands) (February, 2009), Trends\u000a        Tendances (Belgium) (7 October, 2010), The Times Higher\u000a        Education Supplement (UK) (9 December, 2011), L'Espresso\u000a      (Italy) (21 May, 2012), Trend (Austria) (25 March, 2013), and Effect\u000a      (The Netherlands) (5 April, 2013) (source [ix]).\u000a    Chang's influence in public debate was recently recognised by the 2013\u000a      World Thinkers poll, organised by the Prospect magazine, in which\u000a      he ranked no. 18 overall. The only economists who scored higher were Paul\u000a      Krugman (ranked 5) and Amartya Sen (ranked 7) (source [x]). It is\u000a      thus reasonable to claim that Chang has helped to shape thinking about\u000a      both development and the nature of late-modern capitalism in countries\u000a      poor and rich, and at the level of popular as well as elite debates,\u000a      without falling into mere polemics. The philosopher John Gray, indeed, has\u000a      said that Chang is `our best critic of capitalism', while `far from being\u000a      any kind of anti-capitalist' (source xi).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Chang's research has covered a wide range of public policy, including\u000a      industrial policy, trade policy, privatisation, and agricultural policy,\u000a      as well as theories of state intervention. By successfully challenging the\u000a      then prevailing orthodoxy on economic development, his research has had\u000a      significant influence on the actions of many national governments,\u000a      multilateral institutions (e.g., the UN, the World Bank) and NGOs (e.g.,\u000a      Oxfam).

As a member of the Centre\u000a      of Development Studies he is also part of POLIS (the Department of\u000a      Politics and International Studies).His research has been primarily on development economics,\u000a      in particular on policies and institutions that might support or impede\u000a      economic development.\u000a    Up to 1997, Chang's research was focused on developing a general theory\u000a      of industrial policy and applying it to the analysis of the East Asian\u000a      `miracle' economies (Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) between the 1950s and the\u000a      1980s (see, for example, his book The Political Economy of Industrial\u000a        Policy [1994]). This research demonstrated how economic development\u000a      could be accelerated by active industrial policy. However, the research\u000a      led to questions about the universality of the East Asian experiences.\u000a    This led to his subsequent research on international development\u000a      experiences, this time concentrating on the development of today's rich\u000a      countries, culminating in the publication of Kicking Away the Ladder &#8212;\u000a        Development Strategy in Historical Perspective (2002). A major\u000a      finding of this research was that, in the earlier stages of their\u000a      development, those countries aggressively used tariffs, subsidies,\u000a      regulation on foreign direct investment (FDI), state-owned enterprises\u000a      (SOEs), and other measures which until then had been considered unique to\u000a      East Asia. The research also showed that, at that stage, today's developed\u000a      countries did not use the economic and political institutions that they\u000a      push developing countries to adopt as prerequisites of development (e.g.,\u000a      independent central bank, strong patent law).\u000a    These insights presented a major challenge to the dominant development\u000a      policy supported by organisations such as the World Bank and the\u000a      International Monetary Fund, which prescribed a uniform policy formula,\u000a      consisting of free-market policy and pro-profit-making institutions.\u000a      Against this, Chang's research pointed to the need for each country to use\u000a      policies and institutions that were suited to its own needs, given its\u000a      stage of development and other conditions, rather than adopting a\u000a      universal procedure.\u000a    Another important strand in Chang's research has been the analysis of\u000a      institutions, based on research conducted since 1997, represented by the\u000a      journal article, `Breaking the Mould' (Cambridge Journal of Economics,\u000a      2002), the edited volume, Institutional Changes and Economic\u000a        Development (with two authored chapters), and the journal article,\u000a      `Institutions and Economic Development: Theory, Policy, and History' (Journal\u000a        of Institutional Economics, 2011). Chang has conducted a series of\u000a      theoretical and empirical investigations in the area, which have produced\u000a      some fundamental insights for the theories of markets and institutions.\u000a      These insights include: how markets are man-made institutions and cannot\u000a      be treated as `natural' orders that should not be disturbed; how all\u000a      markets need some regulations to function at all, thus demonstrating that\u000a      the standard state-market dichotomy is misleading; how the boundaries of\u000a      markets are in the end politically drawn and thus need to be subject to\u000a      democratic and open debates. The outstanding success of his subsequent\u000a      mass-market books would not have been possible without the exceptionally\u000a      strong theoretical foundation that has underpinned his criticisms of\u000a      free-market economics that the above research provided.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17845","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1327865","Name":"Myanmar"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dr Jones' research has significantly influenced decision-makers, civil\u000a      society groups and the wider public, in the UK and internationally.\u000a    Policymaker Engagement\u000a    As one of Britain's leading experts on Southeast Asia, Jones is regularly\u000a      asked to advise British and overseas government agencies and has thereby\u000a      improved understanding of the region, supported policy analysis, and\u000a      enhanced policymaking.\u000a    Much of this engagement concerns regional security. In the UK parliament,\u000a      Jones was the academic consultant on Southeast Asia: A Political and\u000a        Economic Introduction, a report to inform debate and scrutiny of\u000a      government policy (December 2011), and contributed to two seminars on\u000a      intervention at the House of Lords (January 2011). With the Foreign and\u000a      Commonwealth Office (FCO), Jones participated in a policy planning session\u000a      on EU-ASEAN relations in August 2012. He recommended the EU focus on\u000a      conflict resolution capacity-building on the South China Sea; EU- ASEAN\u000a      negotiations on such cooperation began\u000a        in September. He also suggested developing academic exchanges under\u000a      the UK-ASEAN Knowledge Partnership; in July 2013 the\u000a        FCO launched `Collaborative Development Awards' for this purpose. In\u000a      September 2013, he provided policy analysis and recommendations on\u000a      Southeast Asian security to officials from the FCO, Ministry of Defence\u000a      Department for International Development, and the EU. Jones taught on the\u000a      FCO's Diplomatic Excellence and Knowledge Enhancement programme in January\u000a      2012. He has also presented briefings and policy recommendations on East\u000a      Asian security issues to: Southeast Asian policy elites (Singapore,\u000a      October 2009); EU, Danish and Dutch foreign affairs officials (The Hague,\u000a      June 2010); World Bank and AusAID officials (Perth, December 2010), and\u000a      French Defence and Foreign Ministry officials (May 2013).\u000a    Jones' expertise on sanctions and Myanmar has helped policymakers and\u000a      NGOs reorient themselves at a critical juncture, as Myanmar emerged from\u000a      decades of military dictatorship. Jones was the sole academic expert\u000a      invited to an FCO conference held to reformulate UK and EU policy towards\u000a      Myanmar (Wilton Park, March 2012). His follow-up briefing paper, EU\u000a        Sanctions Against Myanmar: Proposals for Change, proposed radically\u000a      curtailing economic sanctions; this policy was subsequently\u000a        adopted. Jones briefed the new British ambassador to Myanmar in July\u000a      2013, and participated in a UK\/EU policy review on Myanmar in September\u000a      2013. He also briefed staff from Med&#233;cins Sans Fronti&#232;res and the\u000a      Norwegian Refugee Council as they intensified their engagement in Myanmar\u000a      (January 2013), and the Malaysian High Commission (August 2013).

Earlier research investigated\u000a      how international security governance and interventions are shaped by\u000a      domestic socio-political conflicts, pioneering a novel explanatory\u000a      framework rooted in social conflict theory and critical political economy.\u000a      Key publications arising from this research include four journal articles\u000a      and a widely praised book, ASEAN,\u000a          Sovereignty and Intervention in Southeast Asia (2012). This\u000a      framework was further developed using concepts from political geography\u000a      and is being used in new research to explain the governance of non-traditional\u000a        security issues in Southeast Asia and beyond. This work, an\u000a      international collaboration with Dr Shahar Hameiri of Murdoch University,\u000a      is funded by the Australian Research Council (&#163;192k). It explores how and\u000a      why non-military threats (e.g. transboundary pollution, cross-border crime\u000a      and pandemic diseases) are securitised and governed. The framework\u000a      analyses security politics as contestation over the scale of\u000a      governance (its scope and `level', e.g. local, national, regional, global)\u000a      between contending socio-political coalitions, rooted in the political\u000a      economy of the particular issue area. Articles arising from this study\u000a      include `Beyond Securitisation: Explaining the Scope of Security Policy in\u000a      Southeast Asia' (2011), and `The Politics and Governance of\u000a      Non-Traditional Security' (2013).\u000a    The second, related stream of research has focused on how international\u000a      intervention impacts upon and is mediated through socio-political\u000a      struggles in target states. This began with work on statebuilding\u000a      interventions, resulting in three publications including `(Post-)Colonial\u000a      Statebuilding and State Failure in East Timor: Bringing Social Conflict\u000a      Back In' (2010). The major focus of this strand is `How\u000a        Do Economic Sanctions (Not) Work?', funded by an ongoing, three-year\u000a      ESRC grant (&#163;120k). This project investigates the mechanisms by which\u000a      economic sanctions are mediated through domestic political economy\u000a      contexts into political conflicts and outcomes. A major case study in this\u000a      project has been Myanmar (Burma), enabling Jones to establish himself as a\u000a      leading expert on this country.

In March 2008, the Israeli parliament (the Knesset)\u000a      commissioned her to write a report for its Constitution, Law and Justice\u000a      Committee. This report informed deliberation over amending the Israeli\u000a      Parties Financing Act to incorporate financial rewards to parties\u000a      selecting at least 30 percent women candidates. The Knesset consulted\u000a      Murray again in July 2009 when examining the issue of women's\u000a      representation at the municipal level. Murray's work informed committee\u000a      deliberations which resulted in existing policies being maintained. In\u000a      2012, after Ireland adopted quota legislation along French lines, Murray\u000a      addressed a conference in Derry on Women Into Public Life funded by the\u000a      EU. She used the research published in Parties, Gender Quotas and\u000a        Candidate Selection in France and her French Politics\u000a      article to advise gender quota activists, local politicians and community\u000a      groups on working with the new laws.\u000a    Murray also shaped policy debates in Eastern Europe. In June 2009, she\u000a      attended a two-day summit in Warsaw on increasing women's representation\u000a      in the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, organised by the\u000a      Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Office for\u000a      Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). The meeting was attended\u000a      by parliamentarians, party officials, NGO leaders and academics, primarily\u000a      from Eastern Europe. Murray presented expert evidence, based on Parties,\u000a        Gender Quotas and Candidate Selection, on the difficulties parties\u000a      face in implementing gender quotas. This informed the participants about\u000a      the kinds of quotas that might be feasible in their countries, what\u000a      pitfalls to avoid, what problems to anticipate and how to overcome them.\u000a      The summit also generated a public report on gender equality and political\u000a      parties which cites Dr Murray's work.\u000a    Murray has also contributed to public policy debates on women's rights\u000a      and political participation more broadly. In 2012, she gave evidence to a\u000a      Chinese Academy of Social Sciences workshop on women's rights, attended by\u000a      academics and policymakers. Her written and oral contributions, which were\u000a      translated into Chinese, explained how women's rights have been approached\u000a      in Europe and offered policy recommendations for China.\u000a    In Britain, Murray testified to the House of Commons Speaker's Conference\u000a      on Parliamentary Representation in 2009. The Conference explored why\u000a      certain groups are less well represented within Parliament and methods to\u000a      secure more balanced representation. Based on the evidence presented, all\u000a      three main parties pledged to enhance their efforts to select more women\u000a      candidates. These commitments are documented in the official report (see\u000a      reference below), which acknowledges Murray's contribution. Parliament was\u000a      dissolved before they could be implemented, so the impact of this work\u000a      will be felt as the selection procedures commence for the 2015 general\u000a      election.\u000a    Enhancing Public Understanding of Women in Politics\u000a    In addition to shaping policy debates and outcomes, Murray has also\u000a      worked to enhance wider public understanding of women's representation in\u000a      politics through the media and work with professional associations. As\u000a      convenor of the Political Studies Association's Women and Politics Group,\u000a      Murray was a prominent critic of the shortage of women in the British\u000a      cabinet after the 2010 elections. She wrote a lead letter in The Times,\u000a      co-signed by prominent scholars and activists, and appeared on BBC Radio\u000a      London and BBC Radio 5 Live to raise public awareness and spur debate over\u000a      the causes and consequences of women's political under-representation (14\u000a      May 2010). Murray has also appeared several times on Radio 4's Woman's\u000a      Hour to discuss: female executive candidates, using her research in Parliamentary\u000a        Affairs and Cracking the Highest Glass Ceiling (December\u000a      2010); a report highlighting women's absence from positions of power in\u000a      Britain (February 2012); and the impact of the French presidential\u000a      elections on women (April 2012). Murray has appeared on national radio and\u000a      television in France, Britain, Australia, Canada and Russia.\u000a    Murray has also used her research in public talks to encourage women to\u000a      enter politics. She spoke alongside MPs at a House of Commons event to\u000a      inspire women to become parliamentary candidates (January 2010). She\u000a      addressed a similar meeting of the French Socialist Party in March 2010;\u000a      one woman present subsequently contested and won a seat in the French\u000a      parliament.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken by Dr Rainbow Murray in the School of Politics and\u000a      International Relations (SPIR) at QMUL has assisted governments and\u000a      activists from Europe, Israel and China interested in adopting gender\u000a      quotas in elections to understand their potential advantages, pitfalls and\u000a      consequences.

These investigations\u000a      are conducted comparatively, with a particular focus on France, the first\u000a      country in the world to introduce a mandatory quota specifying that 50% of\u000a      election candidates must be women. Murray has published numerous\u000a      influential works on these themes. With the support of SPIR's internal\u000a      peer review processes, she was awarded a Research in Paris grant (&#8364;15k) in\u000a      2011 and a Leverhulme Fellowship (&#163;44.9k) in 2011-12, enabling her to\u000a      employ research assistants (Claire Bisdorff, 1.0 FTE, and Denise Lejeune,\u000a      hourly paid).\u000a    An early article (`Why Didn't Parity Work?', 2004) laid the foundations\u000a      for subsequent investigations into why gender quotas around the world do\u000a      not always meet their targets. Nine years of research on French parity law\u000a      culminated in her first book, Parties, Gender Quotas and Candidate\u000a        Selection in France (2010), which pioneered a new understanding of\u000a      how and why gender quotas are introduced and implemented that placed the\u000a      critical actors within political parties at the heart of the analysis.\u000a      Murray's work on quota adoption and implementation continued with an\u000a      article co- authored with Mona Lena Krook (Rutgers) and Katherine Opello\u000a      (CUNY). This paper, which demonstrates that it is parties rather than\u000a      voters who prevent more women from being elected, has been widely cited\u000a      (60) since first appearing as a conference paper in early 2009, and was\u000a      published in Political Research Quarterly (2012).\u000a    A second major strand of Murray's research focuses on the challenges\u000a      faced by women candidates for executive office. After providing expert\u000a      commentary and an article (published in Parliamentary Affairs,\u000a      2008) on the campaign for the French presidency led by S&#233;gol&#232;ne Royal,\u000a      Murray observed similarities between the gendered treatment of Royal and\u000a      other high profile female politicians like Hillary Clinton and Angela\u000a      Merkel. She therefore assembled a team of researchers to explore nine\u000a      international case studies, culminating in an edited book, Cracking\u000a        the Highest Glass Ceiling (2010). The comparative approach helped\u000a      distinguish gender stereotypes from the particular traits of each woman\u000a      candidate, and demonstrated the many similarities in the ways that women\u000a      candidates are framed by the media, despite great variation in cultures\u000a      and contexts across five continents.\u000a    The third strand of Murray's research relates to the impact of gender\u000a      quotas on the content and institutions of politics, using the French case.\u000a      This work challenges the popular assumption that women elected through a\u000a      gender quota may be second-class candidates lacking the qualifications\u000a      and\/or skills to be effective members of parliament. Her article published\u000a      in Politics and Gender (2010) demonstrated that `quota women' tend\u000a      to be more qualified than women elected before the introduction of quotas,\u000a      and that these women are as productive as men in their parliamentary work.\u000a      This seminal article is the only published work comparing MPs before and\u000a      after a gender quota.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18037","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The key findings in the articles above had three types of national and\u000d\u000a      international impact.

In the UK, successive\u000d\u000a      governments, scholars and journalists claim these policies discourage the\u000d\u000a      nation's history from\u000d\u000a      being taught in schools or promoted by its institutions while encouraging\u000d\u000a      citizens to see themselves\u000d\u000a      as `black', `white' or `Asian', but not as `British'. These policies thus\u000d\u000a      apparently undermine people's\u000d\u000a      understandings of their nation while encouraging them to see themselves as\u000d\u000a      part of smaller groups\u000d\u000a      thus increasing the possibility of division and conflict between such\u000d\u000a      groups.

(Ref 2), concerns the hitherto underexplored relationship\u000d      between population change, religion and politics. Specifically, Professor\u000d      Kaufmann used the World Values surveys to uncover a near-universal effect\u000d      of religiosity on women's fertility, controlling for education, income,\u000d      age and other factors. In Muslim countries, support for Shari'a law\u000d      increases fertility while backing for religious authorities holding\u000d      political power predicts higher fertility rates. In Europe, using survey\u000d      data, he found that religious Jews have twice the number of children as\u000d      the nonreligious. Kaufmann and colleagues made projections which revealed\u000d      the likely effect of religious immigration and fertility on European,\u000d      American and Israeli secularisation to 2050 (Refs 3-6). Theoretically\u000d      Kaufmann has drawn attention to the way global population dynamics are\u000d      countering the decline of religious piety in the West. Furthermore, he is\u000d      the first to highlight how the `second demographic transition' &#8212; in which\u000d      cultural values play an enhanced role in determining family size &#8212;\u000d      empowers religious fundamentalism. He also points to the success of moral\u000d      conservatives in mobilising for political action across faith lines,\u000d      domestically and internationally. Finally, Kaufmann locates these\u000d      developments as challenges to grand narratives of secularism, progress and\u000d      Enlightenment which underpin western modernity.\u000d    Professor Kaufmann began his research in 2005 with an ESRC grant entitled\u000d      `A Dying Creed?: the Demographic Contradictions of Liberal Capitalism.'\u000d      Quantitative research, augmented by qualitative work, resulted in a series\u000d      of policy reports (one an ESRC briefing paper, another for the Institute\u000d      of Jewish Policy Research (JPR), Ref 1). Consequently a cover story\u000d      commissioned from Kaufmann for the November 2006 edition of Prospect\u000d      magazine, `Religion Returns to Europe' drew attention to the fact that\u000d      immigration from religious parts of the world, coupled with strong\u000d      religious retention among second-generation non-Christians in Europe, has\u000d      the potential to slow and ultimately reverse the secularisation process in\u000d      western Europe. This was picked up by the press, and a version featured on\u000d      the cover of Newsweek International (November 2007). Kaufmann was\u000d      subsequently approached by Andrew Franklin, editor of Profile Books, the\u000d      largest independent nonfiction trade publisher in Britain, to write Shall\u000d        the Religious Inherit the Earth? (Ref 2).\u000d    Dissemination and public engagement is embedded in Kaufmann's research\u000d      practice. His work on Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth? was\u000d      supported in 2008-9 by a Belfer Center Fellowship at Harvard University's\u000d      Kennedy School, and a Leverhulme Trust grant. During this period, while he\u000d      completed research for his book, Kaufmann delivered numerous talks in the\u000d      United States, including presentations at the State Department and\u000d      National Intelligence Council (NIC) on the demography of religion in\u000d      Europe, Israel and the Middle East. He also co-authored an article on\u000d      Israel in Foreign Policy in 2009, a magazine widely read by US\u000d      foreign policymakers. In addition, Kaufmann organised a conference at\u000d      Harvard's Weatherhead Center in 2009 and forged connections which led to\u000d      the publication of a co-edited book, Political Demography, with\u000d      US-based political scientists Jack Goldstone and Monica Toft (Ref 4). This\u000d      book was launched at the Wilson Centre in Washington and Monterey\u000d      Institute in California. It was also launched at Birkbeck with the\u000d      formation of the Population, Environment and Resources Group which\u000d      formalises links between departmental colleagues working in cognate\u000d      fields.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20047","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has had significant policy impact in terms of enhancing the\u000a      visibility and policy role of the European Bank for Reconstruction and\u000a      Development (EBRD); legitimating the financial viability of co-financing,\u000a      and changing the operational practice of the European Court of Auditors.\u000a      This impact can be attributed to the fact that Robinson's research was the\u000a      first to explore in a systematic way the implications for the EU budget of\u000a      working with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the EBRD for the\u000a      delivery of EU policy objectives.\u000a    Enhanced policy role of European Bank for Reconstruction and\u000a        Development (EBRD)\u000a    The impact of Robinson's research can be clearly demonstrated\u000a      through specific changes implemented by the EBRD &#8212; which lends &#8364;10bn per\u000a      year to transition economies &#8212; to improve its visibility within the EU.

The implications of this have been extremely\u000a      significant, with the EBRD now increasingly seen as a crucial policy\u000a      partner for the EU, particularly in its lending operations outside the EU\"\u000a      [B].\u000a    Following the success of the appointment of the EBRD Representative for\u000a      EU Affairs, the EBRD is now establishing a permanent office in Brussels\u000a      [F]. Directorial level staff from DG Development and Co-operation (DEVCO)\u000a      described the legacy of the research's recommendations as having brought\u000a      `significant added value' [C]:\u000a    \"The impact of the increase in visibility of the EBRD has been important\u000a      in policy terms, serving to enhance the status of the EBRD in lending\u000a      operations outside the EU [the EBRD lends approx. &#8364;10bn per annum] and\u000a      increasing their role in policy discussions\" [C].\u000a    From the EBRD's point of view, the implications of this have been to\u000a      `significantly raise the status of the EBRD ... making us a formal policy\u000a      partner' [F]. For example, in the ongoing review of the Existing Blending\u000a      Mechanism, the EBRD is now working alongside the EIB in the Technical\u000a      Group of the EU Platform for Blending in External Co-operations `which are\u000a      working on improving the quality and efficiency of EU blending mechanisms'\u000a      [C]. Furthermore, Key EBRD staff have been seconded to DEVCO. This is\u000a      unprecedented.\u000a    Acceleration of co-financing strategy\u000a    The impact of Robinson's work has been to vindicate and\u000a      legitimise DG Economic and Financial Affairs' (ECFIN's) strategy in terms\u000a      of co-financing, through his assessment of the extremely low risks\u000a      presented by the instruments. Robinson's research &#8212; located\u000a      outside the inter-institutional relationship between the European\u000a      Parliament and the European Commission &#8212; demonstrated to the European\u000a      Parliament the limited liability posed by the use of these financial\u000a      instruments in an unequivocal fashion. This had significant policy\u000a      implications:\u000a    \"Dr Robinson's research has had a considerable impact on the\u000a      subject at stake...The confirmation through Dr. Robinson's\u000a      research that these financial instruments did not pose any threats to the\u000a      EU budget in terms of financial liability had significant policy\u000a      implications. Had his study reached the opposite conclusion this would\u000a      have been very problematic for us and would have affected the\u000a      implementation of the Commission's proposals for financial instruments\"\u000a      [D].\u000a    Changes to audit culture\u000a     \u000a    Robinson's research concluded that co-financing posed problems for\u000a      the EU in terms of transparency &#8212; a key concern of the European\u000a      Parliament. Ivailo Kalfin (MEP appointed to follow the study) publicly\u000a      identified that the study clearly raised critical issues which would need\u000a      further investigation and explicitly states that the study had and would\u000a      inform the nature of policy debate. [E]\u000a    To this end, Robinson's research `prescribed a different type of\u000a      evaluation for co-financing, strongly advocating an emphasis on asking\u000a      difficult questions of instruments, rather than the existing pattern of\u000a      audit that was focused on EU `success stories.'' [B] The impact of Robinson's\u000a      work can be clearly illustrated by the European Parliament's decision to\u000a      commission four subsequent studies (total cost approx. &#8364;250,000). MEPs\u000a      have also responded directly to Robinson's research, authoring\u000a      numerous reports on co-financing [B].\u000a    Given that a central theme of Robinson's research was\u000a      transparency, the report made an explicit recommendation for a more robust\u000a      form of audit by the European Court of Auditors, which included a review\u000a      of the contribution made by the EIB and EBRD:\u000a    \"Dr Robinson's research made specific recommendations in relation\u000a      to the way in which the European Court of Auditors undertakes to audit\u000a      co-financing. As officials from the European Parliament, we have seen a\u000a      significant change in ECA audit culture following the publication of Dr.\u000a      Robinson's research. The ECA now undertakes a much more wide-ranging form\u000a      of audit, auditing all of the funds spent as part of the co-financed\u000a      instrument rather than just the contribution from the EU budget, which was\u000a      historically the pattern. This change reflects the recommendations made in\u000a      Dr. Robinson's research\" [B].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The global financial crisis led the European Union (EU) to diversify its\u000a      sources for the EU Budget, including co-financing instruments with\u000a      multilateral development banks. Dr Robinson's research addressed key\u000a      concerns about financial risk and the lack of transparency created through\u000a      such partnerships. His research has been recognised as improving the\u000a      understanding of these complex instruments within EU institutions and its\u000a      impact may be measured through the implementation of several of its key\u000a      recommendations. These include the creation of the `EBRD Representative\u000a      for EU affairs' within a participating bank, the acceleration of EU\u000a      co-financing strategy, and the unprecedented action of the EU Court of\u000a      Auditors including the banks in their auditing process.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    University of Leeds\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Leeds (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Leeds","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007795}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

This research sets out the case for a new understanding of\u000a      European Union (EU) expenditure policy which takes into account the role\u000a      of blended instruments and matched funding (where EU money works alongside\u000a      money from the private sector, national governments, and loans from\u000a      banks), and the important role played by the European Investment Bank\u000a      (EIB).\u000a    Robinson's research highlighted the inadequacy of existing\u000a      accounts of EU expenditure policy, arguing that the focus of both policy\u000a      makers and scholars on headline conflicts over the budget has led to\u000a      fundamental flaws in the understanding of EU expenditure policy. Ignoring\u000a      the importance of the additionality and matched funding principles, the\u000a      pressures for increased spending caused by decisions on inter alia\u000a      accession and foreign direct investment, and the impact of the EIB had\u000a      resulted in a failure to account for over &#8364;150bn of additional spending\u000a      per annum.\u000a    These issues were first highlighted in the journal Comparative\u000a        European Politics (2007) [1], where Robinson argued that\u000a      despite the EIB's long history and its status as the largest multilateral\u000a      development bank in the world (lending &#8364;61bn in 2011), its role in EU\u000a      redistribution had been chronically under-emphasised. This argument for\u000a      the importance of the EIB in any analysis of financial lending,\u000a      transparency and accountability within the EU was developed more\u000a      comprehensively in the Journal of Common Market Studies (2009)\u000a      [2]. Specifically, this article identified (i) the need for systematic\u000a      future research into the EIB's impact on EU strategic objectives and (ii)\u000a      the importance of applying the EU lens of transparency, legitimacy and\u000a      visibility to the workings of the EIB, a conclusion which is further\u000a      underpinned by Robinson's study of informal power in the EU in the\u000a      Journal of Power (2009) [3].\u000a    Key findings of Robinson's research on the EIB highlighted\u000a      concerns about financial risk, as well as the inevitable tension between a\u000a      multilateral development bank making loans on a commercial basis that\u000a      operates under terms of strict confidentiality and the need &#8212; and desire &#8212;\u000a      of the EU to conduct activities in the spirit of transparency and\u000a      visibility [1,2].\u000a    With the European Parliament undergoing a wide-ranging and systematic\u000a      review of the basis for future financing of the budget, in 2010 Robinson\u000a      was commissioned by the EU Parliament's Committee on Budgets and funded\u000a      with a grant of &#8364;56,000 to undertake a further research-led report to\u000a      investigate the implications of co-financing for the EU budget, looking at\u000a      transparency, visibility and financial control [4]. The report &#8212;\u000a      co-authored with Bain, an independent researcher &#8212; focused on the EIB and\u000a      another less well-known multilateral bank, the European Bank for\u000a      Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and was presented to the European\u000a      Parliament in May 2011. Building on the insights from [1, 2 and 3], the\u000a      findings of the report can be summarised as follows:\u000a    Financial control of the EU budget:\u000a    \u000a       Co-financing presents few, if any, risks in terms of liability to the\u000a        EU budget.\u000a       The EIB's external lending poses little threat to the EU budget.\u000a       There are adequate protection mechanisms in place in terms of loss\u000a        provisioning.\u000a       Co-financing presents the European Parliament with multiple\u000a        challenges in terms of its ability to control programmes which are only\u000a        part-funded by the EU budget.\u000a    \u000a    Governance and transparency\u000a    \u000a       Co-financing makes it more difficult for EU institutions to track how\u000a        the budget is spent and to evaluate effectiveness.\u000a       There is a tension between the EU's desire of transparency and the\u000a        EIB and EBRD's desire for commercial confidentiality.\u000a    \u000a    Visibility\u000a    \u000a       Co-financing presents acute problems in terms of visibility, both at\u000a        the level of stakeholder and beneficiary and between EU institutions\u000a        themselves.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21199","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"7909807","Name":"South Sudan"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"51537","Name":"Somalia"},{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"831053","Name":"Kosovo"},{"GeoNamesId":"69543","Name":"Yemen"},{"GeoNamesId":"2215636","Name":"Libya"},{"GeoNamesId":"1327865","Name":"Myanmar"},{"GeoNamesId":"2287781","Name":"Ivory Coast"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282028","Name":"Maldives"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    There have been five types of immediate impact deriving from this work:\u000a    \u000a      Developments of international and domestic standards and best\u000a        practices;\u000a      General dissemination of project results through capacity building;\u000a      Dissemination of project results at points of decision;\u000a      Direct involvement in peace negotiations;\u000a      Establishing a framework for a national transition process.\u000a    \u000a    The first type of impact concerns the development of standards.\u000a      The work performed in the area of community rights has been influential in\u000a      the progressive interpretation and development of international\u000a      instruments. This effect is most visible in relation to the Council of\u000a      Europe, the guardian of the most advanced binding international instrument\u000a      in this area, and the OSCE High Commissioner for National Minorities, as\u000a      is attested in the Forewords contributed by both institutions to the Legal\u000a      Commentary on Political Participation (OUP 2008), edited by Weller [Ref\u000a        1, above]. The impact of this work on actual standards can be\u000a      illustrated by reference to the case of Kosovo. Weller provided\u000a      significant impact into the Ahtisaari peace plan which was endorsed and\u000a      adopted by Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008. He then\u000a      contributed to the drafting of the human and minority rights sections of\u000a      the constitution of Kosovo, which are based on this document. Moreover, he\u000a      drafted the Law on the Promotion and Protection of Communities\u000a      (minorities) which implements these provisions [Source 1, below].\u000a      The Statute of the Kosovo Community Consultative Council is directly based\u000a      on Weller's earlier work in writing the Council of Europe Handbook on\u000a      Minority Consultative Mechanisms (Council of Europe Document\u000a      DH-MIN(2006)-012, 20 October 2006) [Source 2].\u000a    Weller has had a significant role in disseminating the outcomes of his\u000a      work through capacity-building events, with a particular emphasis\u000a      on policy-makers and those involved in the implementation of policy. His\u000a      contribution to policy planning is evidenced, for instance, by his\u000a      presentations to the United Nations Senior Management team on\u000a      power-sharing in peace settlement, and by a two-day training seminar held\u000a      for the Staff of the Organization on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\u000a      at The Hague in 2012 on the challenges of political transitions in the\u000a      Middle East [Source 3]. Moreover, he has been invited to offer\u000a      advice at `challenge sessions' conducted by the FCO to develop its policy,\u000a      and given subsequent advice, for instance on UK policy relating to the\u000a      recognition of states, in particular Somaliland in 2012 [Source 4].\u000a      He acted as a key speaker at a seminar in the House of Commons in 2010\u000a      concerning legal controls over military action [Source 5]. He has\u000a      been a lecturer in the Senior Officers' Course of the Royal College of\u000a      Defence Studies (2008 to present), which every year exposes around 100\u000a      senior military officers from around the world to academic advances in the\u000a      area of international law and politics.\u000a    The third type of impact has been obtained through direct dissemination\u000a        of project results to decision-makers at the very point of decision.\u000a      This has included consultations and workshops just before or during\u000a      negotiations for one or both of the sides in on-going peace settlement\u000a      attempts. Examples are workshops with high-level officials, or\u000a      delegations, from Georgia (29.4.2009), Kosovo (24.7.2010), Sudan\u000a      (8-9.12.2009, 18.7.2010, 17.10.2010), Syria (6.3.2013), (south) Yemen\u000a      (March 2013) and Burma (May 2013). The workshops were very much focused on\u000a      allowing the participants to draw upon and operationalize the findings\u000a      flowing from this project activity, providing settlement options to the\u000a      participants at critical points in important negotiations. One may also\u000a      include in this set of activities formal advisory memoranda provided to\u000a      the United Nations Secretariat, for instance on the legal authority of\u000a      United Nations Security Council Resolutions and on the legality of the use\u000a      of unmanned drones (2012\/13).\u000a    The fourth type of impact relates to direct involvement in peace\u000a        settlement negotiations themselves. This has included the provision\u000a      of legal and policy advice to delegations in peace settlement\u000a      negotiations, to the African Union and League of Arab States when acting\u000a      as mediator, and to the United Nations Department of Political Affairs, or\u000a      individual Special Representatives of the United Nations Secretary-General\u000a      [Source 6].\u000a    In relation to advice to the African Union, the most pronounced case\u000a      concerns South Sudan. Weller was engaged by the African Union to support\u000a      the pre-referendum negotiations between North and South [Source 7].\u000a      Moreover, in 2011 he served as advisor to the Joint Special Envoy of the\u000a      African Union and the United Nations Secretary General for a Settlement in\u000a      Darfur, assisting the delegation of the Justice and Equality Movement and\u000a      the Mediation Team. He participated in the critical phases of the Doha\u000a      negotiations on Darfur, resulting in the settlement (2011) that is at\u000a      present being implemented [Source 8].\u000a    Weller also implemented the project findings in his role as advisor to\u000a      the League of Arab States and United Nations Joint Special Envoy on Syria,\u000a      HE Kofi Annan. He drafted the Guidelines and Principles for a Syrian-led\u000a      Transition adopted in the Geneva Action Group Communiqu&#233; in July 2012.\u000a      This was adopted on 27 September 2013 by the UN Security Council as the\u000a      basis for a possible peace settlement [Source 9]. In 2013 he has\u000a      led the preparations for the projected Geneva International Peace\u000a      Conference for Syria chaired by HE Lakhdar Brahimi, the\u000a      Secretary-General's Special Envoy [Source 10].\u000a    Weller has also given advice on power-sharing issues to the Special Envoy\u000a      of the United Nations Secretary-General on Libya, Jordanian Foreign\u000a      Minister al-Khatib (2011) [Source 11]. He also served as legal and\u000a      political advisor for the United Nations Special Advisor on Yemen, and\u000a      drafted the Yemen peace settlement of November 2011 [Source 12].\u000a    The fifth element concerns planning for UN sponsored-or supported\u000a        transitions and their implementation. He gave advice to the UN\u000a      Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs on the emerging transitions\u000a      in Egypt and the post-election crisis in C&#244;te d'Ivoire, and authored a\u000a      general guidance manual on transitions for the UN Department of Political\u000a      Affairs [Source 13]. In 2011, Professor Weller served as a member\u000a      of the UN inter-agency task force for pre-planning for Libya, and\u000a      contributed elements to the strategic planning document that emerged [Source\u000a        14].

Professor Weller joined the\u000a      University of Cambridge in 1990 and became Professor of International Law\u000a      and International Constitutional Studies in 2010. The project has been\u000a      developed by him over the past decade. He devised the concept, and raised\u000a      in excess of USD 1.5 million from major Foundations. Professor Weller\u000a      established and led an international research team and authored the major\u000a      elements of the outputs of the project.\u000a    The first phase of the work addressed the issue of secession and\u000a      secessionist conflicts. It studied this phenomenon in depth, reviewing a\u000a      significant number of internationalized peace agreements of the 1990s, and\u000a      then identified different types of accommodation that have occurred in\u000a      practice. The project noted a new trend in recent settlement practice and\u000a      engaged in a detailed collective study of the phenomenon of complex\u000a      power-sharing agreements as a means of settling ethnic and\u000a      self-determination conflicts. Through this work, it advanced the\u000a      understanding of peaceful remedies to address on-going conflict, and of\u000a      the architecture of complex power sharing, combining consociationalist\u000a      tools with integrative techniques of state construction and with\u000a      international involvement in post-settlement implementation.\u000a    In a further phase the project focused on asymmetric autonomy as a means\u000a      of addressing self-determination conflicts. This work considered the\u000a      concerning trend of simply assigning a broad range of powers to\u000a      secessionist units without paying sufficient attention to the addition of\u000a      integrationalist elements of state design, and offered guidance on how to\u000a      overcome the weaknesses in such a simplistic approach.\u000a    After having considered macro-solutions in terms of state design, the\u000a      project then addressed softer options of accommodating non-dominant groups\u000a      within states. This concerned mechanisms for political participation of\u000a      minorities in the overall state. The project offered original insights\u000a      into the emerging principle of political participation as a legal\u000a      entitlement, along with the different sets of tools for facilitating its\u000a      implementation.\u000a    Having dealt with autonomy, complex power-sharing and political\u000a      participation mechanisms, attention turned to the issue of facilitated\u000a      secession. The research then identified and analysed entirely new patterns\u000a      of addressing the self-determination dimension outright, ranging from\u000a      deferred secession options to the balancing of claims and the issue of\u000a      conditional statehood.\u000a    In its present phase, the project has broadened out, addressing internal\u000a      peace settlements, and the peace processes leading to them, more\u000a      generally. In this way, the understanding of conflict management tools\u000a      derived from the context of self-determination conflicts can, where\u000a      appropriate, also be put to use in other contexts.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21695","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3585968","Name":"El Salvador"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    University of Glasgow research contributed to a campaign against gender\u000d\u000a      violence in El Salvador that was driven by civil society organisations,\u000d\u000a      gained widespread popular support and ultimately helped to create the\u000d\u000a      momentum that led to a change in the law. Dr Mo Hume conducted case\u000d\u000a      studies, collecting qualitative evidence of violence against women which\u000d\u000a      was utilised by Oxfam America and a coalition of Salvadoran NGOs in their\u000d\u000a      campaign Una Vida Diferente\u000d\u000a      (A Different Life).\u000d\u000a    In 2008 Oxfam America published an internal report on Hume's fieldwork\u000d\u000a      which detailed the evidence-based findings of women's perceptions of and\u000d\u000a      responses to gendered violence in San Marcos and Ahuachapan. This report\u000d\u000a      directly informed the Una Vida Diferente campaign, by confirming\u000d\u000a      (and exploring in depth) initial indications that public perceptions were\u000d\u000a      a significant contributing factor in the problem of gender violence (a\u000d\u000a      2005 survey by Salvadoran NGO CS Sondea had shown that 83% of people did\u000d\u000a      not consider rape a crime and 56.4% considered it normal behaviour for a\u000d\u000a      man to strike a woman).\u000d\u000a    Oxfam America, together with Salvadoran NGOs and the Human Rights\u000d\u000a      Institute of Central American University working in a coalition called\u000d\u000a      Campaign to End Gender Violence (Campa&#241;a de Prevenci&#243;n de la Violencia de\u000d\u000a      G&#233;nero &#8212; CPVG), launched the Una Vida Diferente: A Different Life\u000d\u000a      campaign, to raise awareness, mobilise public opinion and drive changes to\u000d\u000a      both practice and legislation. Una Vida Diferente recognised the\u000d\u000a      importance of preventing gender-based violence through advocacy,\u000d\u000a      leadership programmes and working with men to try and influence cultural\u000d\u000a      factors and concepts of masculinity. As part of this wider campaign, Hume\u000d\u000a      assisted in disseminating evidence from her study to a wider audience,\u000d\u000a      presenting her research findings to women parliamentarians in 2008,\u000d\u000a      focusing on the stories of women who had lived in a climate of fear and\u000d\u000a      violence, and highlighting the importance of improved legislation on this\u000d\u000a      issue. The female parliamentarians participated in a certificate course on\u000d\u000a      gender violence as part of the CPVG, and later played an important role in\u000d\u000a      drafting the new legislation.\u000d\u000a    Hume's second field study in 2011 (report published by Oxfam America in\u000d\u000a      2012) assessed the impact of the campaign for Oxfam and allowed the\u000d\u000a      organisation to measure the success of their initiative and focus efforts\u000d\u000a      on the methods shown to be successful. Key achievements of the CPVG\u000d\u000a      include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      development and approval of the Protocol for the Application of the\u000d\u000a        Domestic Violence Law, allowing it to be more consistently enforced.\u000d\u000a      development of the draft bill that ultimately resulted in the Special\u000d\u000a        Integrated Law for a Life Free from Violence for Women. This was a major\u000d\u000a        policy victory for the women's movement in El Salvador.\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Education's adoption of school-based violence prevention\u000d\u000a        as a priority and inclusion in curriculum of content on gender based\u000d\u000a        violence.\u000d\u000a      establishment of specific standards and procedures for dealing with\u000d\u000a        teachers accused of violence or sexual harassment under the Reform of\u000d\u000a        the Law Teaching Profession. This had not existed previously in El\u000d\u000a        Salvador and there was no disciplinary mechanism available to schools to\u000d\u000a        dismiss teachers who had been found guilty of sexual harassment.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Oxfam America's Research and Evaluation Advisor says \"Campaign\u000d\u000a      stakeholders still speak very fondly of [Hume's] research and work with\u000d\u000a      [Oxfam] on indicators; it was truly of great value to partners and field\u000d\u000a      staff.\" Due in part to the Una Vida Diferente campaign, the\u000d\u000a      Salvadoran government passed the Special Integral Law for a Life Free of\u000d\u000a      Violence for Women on 25 November 2010. This law addresses El Salvador's\u000d\u000a      record of femicide, which in 2006 was 13 times higher than that in the\u000d\u000a      United States, by introducing a penalty of 30-50 years' imprisonment for\u000d\u000a      femicide, and fines and jail sentences for pornography and psychological\u000d\u000a      abuse. The law came into effect 1 January 2012. Hume's research had shown\u000d\u000a      that many Salvadoran women did not report domestic violence due to the\u000d\u000a      paternalistic reaction from police and other officials, which often meant\u000d\u000a      that a woman would be sent home to suffer further abuse from a husband\u000d\u000a      outraged that she had complained. The new law enforces the role of the\u000d\u000a      police and other officials in protecting women's rights in all cases of\u000d\u000a      domestic or gender violence. Hume's follow-up fieldwork from 2011\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that local service providers who had been working with the\u000d\u000a      campaign demonstrated greater effectiveness in detecting and following up\u000d\u000a      cases of gender violence and highlighted important developments in local\u000d\u000a      women's advocacy strategies whereby women have formed `Citizen Windows' to\u000d\u000a      provide support for survivors of violence and to hold state institutions\u000d\u000a      to account.\u000d\u000a    As a result of Hume's work with Oxfam and her ongoing research into\u000d\u000a      gender violence in Central America, she has been asked to act as an expert\u000d\u000a      witness in Canada and the United States for political asylum cases where\u000d\u000a      people have escaped gender or gang violence in El Salvador. Hume\u000d\u000a      contributed expert witness evidence (both written and oral) to over 10\u000d\u000a      cases since 2007. The attorney of one such political asylum case in the\u000d\u000a      United States stated:\u000d\u000a    We are extremely grateful for your assistance on our recent asylum\u000d\u000a        case, concerning an imputed LGBT and gender-related violence claim out\u000d\u000a        of El Salvador.

Since the signing of the UN-brokered peace accords in 1992, one\u000d\u000a      of the most notable characteristics of Salvadoran society has been\u000d\u000a      continued high levels of violence, demonstrating one of the highest murder\u000d\u000a      rates in the world. The `paradox' of El Salvador's peace is that it has\u000d\u000a      yielded more violent deaths than the civil war. How to understand these\u000d\u000a      high levels of violence alongside processes to build peace and democracy\u000d\u000a      has emerged as a key concern for both scholars and policy makers.\u000d\u000a      International organisations, such as the World Bank, the Inter-American\u000d\u000a      Development Bank, UN agencies and NGOs are primarily concerned with its\u000d\u000a      impact on development and have commissioned research on the impact of\u000d\u000a      violence on political and economic processes to feed into policy. For\u000d\u000a      scholars in Latin American politics, understanding these contradictory\u000d\u000a      processes provides a fascinating, if troubling, area for research.\u000d\u000a    Staff at Oxfam America in Boston approached Dr Mo Hume (Senior Lecturer,\u000d\u000a      Politics, 2005-present) to carry out research on local perceptions of\u000d\u000a      gender violence in two municipalities. Hume's research was based on four\u000d\u000a      field trips to El Salvador between 2007-2008 and provided a baseline for\u000d\u000a      Oxfam's Campaign to End Gender Violence as well as setting up a system to\u000d\u000a      monitor and evaluate the campaign. Each case provided in-depth analysis of\u000d\u000a      women's knowledge, perceptions and experiences with gender based violence,\u000d\u000a      as well as a critical evaluation of the available statistics and\u000d\u000a      background on the two localities. This research formed the basis of a\u000d\u000a      refereed journal article (Hume 2008) and a research monograph published by\u000d\u000a      Wiley Blackwell (Hume 2009a).\u000d\u000a    Building on recent debates in international development on the necessity\u000d\u000a      of evidence based policy making and the importance of qualitative\u000d\u000a      indicators, Hume facilitated a process with local stakeholders to identify\u000d\u000a      how they would measure positive change in terms of prevention of gender\u000d\u000a      based violence. Key areas identified by the research were the need to\u000d\u000a      strengthen the leadership of local women activists; assess the degree of\u000d\u000a      credibility in state institutions; establish credible legal mechanisms;\u000d\u000a      and improve the quality of statistical data to allow effective measurement\u000d\u000a      of gender violence over time.\u000d\u000a    In June 2008, Hume was invited to present initial research findings to\u000d\u000a      the women parliamentarians in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador. The\u000d\u000a      passing of a new integrated law on gender violence was facilitated by a\u000d\u000a      change in government in 2009 which was more open to civil society\u000d\u000a      organisations. In the context of the new law, Hume was invited to carry\u000d\u000a      out further research in 2011 to assess change since 2008.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21702","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"2629691","Name":"Iceland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Mawdsley's research programme has enhanced understanding among key policy\u000a      actors of the potential problems and benefits of increasing European\u000a      co-operation on defence and security technologies policy. She has adopted\u000a      a deliberate strategy of collaborating with key government-funded think\u000a      tanks (e.g. Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, the Deutsche Gesellschaft\u000a      f&#252;r Ausw&#228;rtige Politik and the Flemish Peace Institute) to promote wider\u000a      use of her research findings by policy-makers, parliamentarians, and\u000a      non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In addition, she has developed\u000a      close links with policy-makers, leading to invitations to the 2008, 2010\u000a      and 2012 EU armaments policy conferences under the respective EU\u000a      presidencies of France, Belgium and Cyprus, where she was one of five\u000a      academic observers. Her approach has helped to ensure that all three\u000a      strands of her work on armaments and security technologies policies have\u000a      informed policy debates.\u000a    First, Mawdsley's early research at Newcastle on armaments co-operation\u000a      underpinned a series of policy papers that she wrote during her Marie\u000a      Curie Fellowship, including a report she co-authored with Quille\u000a      (International Security Information Service), which was written originally\u000a      for the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament and\u000a      subsequently published in a longer version (The European Security\u000a      Strategy: A New Framework for ESDP and Equipping the EU Rapid Reaction\u000a      Force, ISIS Report, Brussels, 2003, available at: http:\/\/www.isis-\u000a      europe.eu\/sites\/default\/files\/publications-downloads\/reports_4.pdf).\u000a      This examined how the EU might fill its military capability gaps, given\u000a      the unlikeliness of additional funding, through innovative cooperation\u000a      methods, and drew on her research into the conditions under which\u000a      cooperative measures like pooling and sharing might succeed. This work had\u000a      a lasting influence on armaments policy debates. In a 2008 strategy paper\u000a      on capacity sharing, French Lieutenant-Colonel Coquet, writing for the\u000a      leading Paris-based think tank, Institut fran&#231;ais des relations\u000a      internationales (Ifri), draws heavily on Mawdsley and Quille's proposals\u000a      for rationalising military equipment needs through pooling and sharing\u000a      [IMP1, pp.14, 18, 20, 22, 36, 38]. Mawdsley and Quille's work was also the\u000a      only non-official document cited in a report from the 2009 Conference of\u000a      European National Armaments Directors, the senior civil servants\u000a      responsible for armaments policy in each state, which strongly urged the\u000a      pooling and sharing of military capabilities [IMP2, p.80]. The following\u000a      year pooling and sharing was formally endorsed as an EU policy by\u000a      Ministers of Defence, and the Ghent Framework established to enable this.\u000a    More recently, Mawdsley's research on the troubled history of armaments\u000a      co-operation in Europe has continued to inform papers written by key\u000a      policy actors. For example, the first EU Chief of Military Staff Graham\u000a      Messervy-Whiting and ex-UK ambassador Alyson Bailes, who both served in\u000a      the Western European Union (WEU), drew on her account of the cultural and\u000a      ideological differences between French and British defence procurement\u000a      policies in their 2011 paper on the death of the WEU [IMP3, pp.30ff].\u000a    Second, the underpinning research on the effects of EU armaments policy\u000a      on member states and how those states have responded has been used to\u000a      inform policy-makers in several countries, including Germany, Iceland and\u000a      Romania. For example, the 2012 briefing for the German representative on\u000a      the French Defence White Book Commission (a major review of French defence\u000a      policy) included a copy of her co-authored paper (with Kempin and\u000a      Steinicke) on the development of, and problems with, Franco-British\u000a      defence agreements [IMP4]. In his 2011 article for Infosera, the\u000a      in-house magazine of the Romanian Ministry of Defence, the Director\u000a      General of the Romanian Directorate of Defence Intelligence draws on\u000a      earlier work by Mawdsley (with Kempin and Steinicke) to argue that while\u000a      there may be some co-operation between larger states there remains little\u000a      evidence of successful EU-wide co-operation [IMP5, p.11]. Mawdsley's\u000a      analysis of the likely effects of EU armaments policies on smaller states\u000a      was the basis for a substantial section of a report commissioned by the\u000a      Icelandic Defence Agency (2009) on the consequences of EU accession for\u000a      Icelandic defence policy [IMP6, pp.32-7]. Her work has also informed\u000a      reports by think tanks in France, Germany, Hungary and Poland.\u000a    Third, Mawdsley's recent analysis of the development of EU and member\u000a      state policy affecting the homeland security industry has informed the\u000a      work of parliamentarians and leading NGOs campaigning for export controls\u000a      on security technologies. Her preliminary research was presented to an\u000a      audience of policy-makers, parliamentarians and NGOs at an event\u000a      co-organised by the Flemish Government and several leading think tanks as\u000a      part of the Belgian EU presidency activities (November 2010). The evidence\u000a      presented was subsequently used to inform a critical response to recent\u000a      developments in EU defence and security industry policies in a policy\u000a      paper published by the European Parliament Group for the United European\u000a      Left\/Nordic Green Left [IMP7, pp.31, 42-3, 47]. Her fuller analysis of the\u000a      homeland security industry in Europe was funded by the Flemish Peace\u000a      Institute and launched at the Flemish Parliament in February 2013 to an\u000a      audience of 32 Flemish and European parliamentarians, representatives of\u000a      the Flemish export licensing authority, NGOs and journalists. The\u000a      influential NGO Statewatch has posted the full report on their website and\u000a      her detailed analysis of the gaps in export controls and the policies\u000a      shaping the homeland security industry in Europe is already informing the\u000a      work of several NGOs, including the Campaign Against the Arms Trade,\u000a      Saferworld and the Quaker Council for European Affairs [IMP8]. A senior\u000a      researcher and lobbyist for Campagne tegen Wapenhandel (Campaign\u000a      Against the Arms Trade, Netherlands) has highlighted the important\u000a      contribution that this research has made to their understanding of this\u000a      dimension of the arms trade:\u000a    \"Understanding this sector is of crucial importance for civil society\u000a      researchers, lobbyists and activists in the arms control community, as\u000a      well as those involved in monitoring the increasing role of security\u000a      technology in government's internal security infrastructure. Dr.\u000a      Mawdsley's report has helped us to better understand the recent and likely\u000a      future developments in EU policies on security technologies. It has\u000a      provided new insights into export controls of security technologies, which\u000a      we are using to inform our campaigning work in the Netherlands and the EU\"\u000a      [IMP9].\u000a    In sum, Mawdsley's research on the benefits and problems of increasing\u000a      co-operation in European armaments and security technologies policy has\u000a      reached and informed key defence and security policy actors in\u000a      governments, think tanks and NGOs in the EU, Germany, France, Belgium and\u000a      several other European countries. It has been systematically influential\u000a      throughout the stages of the policy process: influencing the very\u000a      preliminary stages where policy possibilities are imagined by key actors\u000a      (e.g., Coquet); becoming an important point of reference as possibilities\u000a      are narrowed down; and remaining influential as policy preferences are\u000a      established and institutionalised. As a result, it has made a distinctive\u000a      contribution to policy debates about pooling and sharing, the effects of\u000a      EU armaments policy on member states, and the political significance of\u000a      the development of the homeland security industry in Europe.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research on European cooperation on armaments and homeland security\u000a      technologies policy has informed discussions within the defence and\u000a      security policy community.

From 2001-4, she held a\u000a      Marie Curie postdoctoral fellowship based first at the Bonn International\u000a      Center for Conversion (BICC) and then at the Universit&#233; libre de\u000a      Bruxelles. Her research has included both independent work and\u000a      collaborations with Kempin and Steinicke (both Stiftung Wissenschaft und\u000a      Politik Berlin).\u000a    Mawdsley's work has examined the historical development of European\u000a      cooperation on armaments and security technologies and provides a detailed\u000a      analysis of the drivers of increased cooperation, obstacles that prevent\u000a      or limit cooperation, the conditions for successful cooperation, and the\u000a      effects on member states of the EU actively promoting cooperation. Her\u000a      ESRC-funded PhD research studied the history of armaments cooperation in\u000a      Britain, France and Germany during the 1990s (Mawdsley (2000) The\u000a        changing face of European armaments co-operation: continuity and change\u000a        in British, French and German armaments policy, 1990-2000, PhD\u000a      thesis, University of Newcastle upon Tyne). Her analysis identified the\u000a      drivers of increased cooperation, including falling defence budgets, U.S.\u000a      defence restructuring and a decreasing world armaments market. However,\u000a      the number of multilateral collaborative procurement projects actually\u000a      remained low throughout the 1990s and many of the larger projects (e.g.\u000a      Eurofighter and A400M) encountered difficulties. Mawdsley argued that\u000a      regardless of the clear logic in favour of greater cooperation, European\u000a      level institutions designed to foster cooperation would continue to\u000a      struggle unless there was significant convergence in strategic culture,\u000a      industrial interests and procurement practices among member states.\u000a      Successful cooperation was therefore most likely between smaller groupings\u000a      of like-minded states. More recently, she has shown that these issues have\u000a      continued to cause difficulties for collaborative procurement projects,\u000a      including the flagship A400M military transporter aircraft project [1].\u000a    In the last ten years, the EU has increased its influence in armaments\u000a      policy through the establishment of the European Defence Agency and the\u000a      Commission's growing legislative activism. Mawdsley has examined the\u000a      development of EU influence, the response of larger states to potential\u000a      restrictions on their sovereignty, and the likely effects on smaller EU\u000a      members. In work with Kempin and Steinicke, she argued that Britain and\u000a      France, as the most powerful military actors in the EU, have responded by\u000a      developing bilateral rather than EU-wide cooperative agreements in order\u000a      to secure the future of their own defence industries and technological\u000a      capacities [2]. Their analysis shows that EU-wide defence cooperation is\u000a      unlikely to satisfy British and French expectations about Europe's future\u000a      military capacities. In her research on the effects of EU initiatives on\u000a      smaller states, which have often had protectionist procurement regimes to\u000a      protect uncompetitive `national champions', she argued that Commission\u000a      policies are likely to increase the geographical concentration of the\u000a      defence industry in larger member states to the detriment of smaller\u000a      states' interest in EU-wide defence cooperation [3].\u000a    The development of European armaments policy has been further complicated\u000a      by changes to how national security has been understood post-9\/11. The\u000a      transfer of U.S. homeland security approaches into the European context\u000a      has stimulated the growth of new internal security technologies and firms\u000a      in Europe. Mawdsley examined how EU policy in this area has evolved and,\u000a      in particular, the attempt by the EU to integrate internal security\u000a      policies with armaments policies as part of the development of a Common\u000a      Security and Defence Policy and an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice\u000a      [4]. She has argued that the two sectors are not as interchangeable as has\u000a      been suggested, due to the different nature of the firms involved, and\u000a      more importantly the type of customer they serve. Moreover, she maintained\u000a      that the EU's attempt to promote the internal security industry by\u000a      encouraging exports of security technologies, which have subsequently been\u000a      used by some regimes to suppress protests, raises neglected ethical and\u000a      legal questions about EU policy on export controls.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21703","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The findings and deliberative poll methodology had a direct and enduring\u000d\u000a      effect on the understanding and attitudes of key stakeholders in education\u000d\u000a      policy in Northern Ireland. It has provided significant benefits in two\u000d\u000a      areas. First, its findings have consistently been used by policy actors to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate informed public support for more sharing in education. Second,\u000d\u000a      it has been widely recognised as the leading example of best practice in\u000d\u000a      public consultation on education policy in Northern Ireland.\u000d\u000a    Demonstrating Support for Shared Education\u000d\u000a    The key research findings have made a distinct contribution to how\u000d\u000a      education policy actors understand public attitudes to sharing in\u000d\u000a      education and have been used to support arguments for shared education\u000d\u000a      policies because they are widely accepted as providing robust and reliable\u000d\u000a      evidence of informed parental support. Most recently, the Ministerial\u000d\u000a      Advisory Group on Advancing Shared Education (MAG), set up by the\u000d\u000a      Education Minister to advise on the future of shared education in Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland, cited the results of the poll in its March 2013 report, Advancing\u000a        Shared Education [IMP1, pp.84 and 92], as evidence that a majority\u000d\u000a      of parents support various forms of sharing in education. It is the only\u000d\u000a      academic source used in the report to provide evidence about parents'\u000d\u000a      views. The research was also quoted by two statutory bodies, the Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland Community Relations Council (NICRC) [IMP2, pp. 6, 11] and the\u000d\u000a      Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI) [IMP3, p. 9], in their\u000d\u000a      submissions to the MAG's consultation process. The MAG's reference to the\u000d\u000a      poll's results &#8212; six years after it took place &#8212; and the use of the\u000d\u000a      research by other stakeholders in the intervening period provides strong\u000d\u000a      evidence of its enduring impact.\u000d\u000a    The deliberative poll was cited in the 2010 \"Challenge Paper\", Ensuring\u000a        the Good Relations Work in Our Schools Counts [IMP4], published by\u000d\u000a      the Good Relations Forum, a commission established under the auspices of\u000d\u000a      NICRC and ECNI. The paper identifies shared education as a significant\u000d\u000a      strategic area for Government reform arguing that it is a crucial vehicle\u000d\u000a      for social integration. It uses the results of the poll to support the\u000d\u000a      claim that \"people want more sharing with 71% [in the Omagh poll]\u000d\u000a      specifically stating that they would support integrated education\" [IMP4,\u000d\u000a      p.29]. The research has been used by other education stakeholders,\u000d\u000a      nationally and locally. For example, the Council for Catholic Maintained\u000d\u000a      Schools (CCMS) developed its own response to the education policy\u000d\u000a      implications of the research and discussed it at its executive committee\u000d\u000a      meeting in November 2008 [IMP5] while Drumragh Integrated College (an\u000d\u000a      integrated school in Omagh) cited the deliberative poll as evidence of a\u000d\u000a      \"groundswell of support for integrated education in Omagh\" in its 2012\u000d\u000a      development proposal [IMP6, p.3].\u000d\u000a    This reflects a broader awareness of the research findings among key\u000d\u000a      education policy actors. The Director of the Equality and All-Ireland\u000d\u000a      Directorate in DENI has said that the research is \"something which I don't\u000d\u000a      think anybody working in this area would be unaware of or\u000d\u000a      certainly shouldn't be unaware of\" [IMP7]. In Omagh, the poll was\u000d\u000a      an important catalyst for the development of a shared site, at the old\u000d\u000a      Lisanelly army barracks, for six post-primary schools of different\u000d\u000a      denominations, which received DENI support in 2008 and planning permission\u000d\u000a      in 2013. The Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Council for Catholic\u000d\u000a      Maintained Schools (CCMS) has said that the deliberative poll \"created a\u000d\u000a      context in which Lisanelly could move forward, I'm quite sure about that\"\u000d\u000a      [IMP8]. Similarly, the Project Director for the Lisanelly development said\u000d\u000a      \"it brought about a change in peoples' attitude and also it was useful in\u000d\u000a      that it was quite clear that once people understood what it was about,\u000d\u000a      they were actually very positive about the idea of shared education\"\u000d\u000a      [IMP9].\u000d\u000a    Influencing the Approach to Public Consultation on Education Policy\u000d\u000a    The methodological example set by the Omagh deliberative poll continues\u000d\u000a      to influence the attitudes of key education stakeholders to effective\u000d\u000a      consultation processes. The Good Relations Forum paper [IMP4, pp.15 and\u000d\u000a      40] recommends deliberative polling as an appropriate consultation method.\u000d\u000a      The Senior Development Officer at the Northern Ireland Council for\u000d\u000a      Integrated Education (NICIE) described the deliberative poll as the \"Rolls\u000d\u000a      Royce\" of consultation methods: \"that was the way to do it. If you had the\u000d\u000a      money that would be the way to do it [now]\" [IMP10]. The Chief Executive\u000d\u000a      Officer of CCMS recalled \"... it was a very valuable process. It proved\u000d\u000a      the value, if nothing else, of giving people information and asking them\u000d\u000a      to challenge preconceived notions\" and his Deputy said \"it did influence\u000d\u000a      the type of methodology that we used in respect of the general approach to\u000d\u000a      consultations of creating an informed context against which people,\u000d\u000a      parents, stakeholders would be asked to respond\" [IMP8].\u000d\u000a    The research has also influenced attitudes to consultation processes\u000d\u000a      within the Department of Education. A DENI senior civil servant said the\u000d\u000a      draft DENI legislation on area based education planning, which emphasises\u000d\u000a      the \"involvement of relevant interests\" in the planning process, was\u000d\u000a      influenced by the experience of being involved in the Omagh deliberative\u000d\u000a      poll: \"what it certainly I think has done is influenced our thinking\u000d\u000a      about, if not our practice, about how we consult and engage on these sorts\u000d\u000a      of complex issues and I think the most powerful thing out of the poll is\u000d\u000a      the recognition that actually the tried and tested unthinking methods of\u000d\u000a      consultation on issues as complex as education are of limited use. The\u000d\u000a      poll I think proves that. The differences between T1 and T2 measurements\u000d\u000a      show that there's a huge value, in fact a necessity, in investing the time\u000d\u000a      and effort and providing people with information about the issues that\u000d\u000a      you're expecting them to give a view on\" [IMP7].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This innovative research has had an enduring influence on shared\u000d\u000a      education policy debates in Northern Ireland.

In his 2006\u000d\u000a      monograph, Deliberative Democracy and Divided Societies [1],\u000d\u000a      O'Flynn makes the case for introducing institutions that promote\u000d\u000a      deliberative democracy in religiously and ethnically divided societies. He\u000d\u000a      argues that talking about important political issues under controlled\u000d\u000a      conditions that establish fair rules for discussion can promote mutual\u000d\u000a      trust, reconciliation and the recognition of shared goals. More\u000d\u000a      specifically, he was the first to explicitly advocate the use of\u000d\u000a      \"deliberative opinion polls\" in divided societies [1, pp.86-88].\u000d\u000a      Conventional opinion polls are often criticised for eliciting uninformed\u000d\u000a      and unreflective responses, which may help to reinforce existing social\u000d\u000a      and political divisions. In contrast, the participants in a deliberative\u000d\u000a      poll are provided with the opportunity to learn about a given policy issue\u000d\u000a      through briefing materials, facilitated small group discussions and\u000d\u000a      plenary sessions with expert stakeholders, before they are polled.\u000d\u000a      Accordingly, deliberative polls seek to reveal what the public would think\u000d\u000a      if its members had the same opportunities for informed and reflective\u000d\u000a      discussion as the representative sample who participate in the poll.\u000d\u000a    In 2006-7, O'Flynn led a research team that conducted the first\u000d\u000a      deliberative poll in a divided society to test empirically the usefulness\u000d\u000a      of the methodology. The poll was on the reform of the education system in\u000d\u000a      general and shared education in particular (i.e. Catholic and Protestant\u000d\u000a      children being taught together or Catholic and Protestant schools sharing\u000d\u000a      facilities or teachers to provide an enhanced curriculum). It was\u000d\u000a      conducted in Omagh, Northern Ireland. Omagh was chosen because it is in\u000d\u000a      important respects a microcosm of Northern Ireland: demographically, it is\u000d\u000a      highly representative, and educationally, it contains all of the main\u000d\u000a      school-types [2, p.4]. O'Flynn's collaborators included the creators of\u000d\u000a      the deliberative poll methodology (Fishkin, Stanford and Luskin, Texas)\u000d\u000a      and experts on education policy in Northern Ireland (Gallagher and\u000d\u000a      Russell, Queen's Belfast). The research was funded by Atlantic\u000d\u000a      Philanthropies, a US-based charitable foundation which aims to improve the\u000d\u000a      lives of vulnerable and disadvantaged people.\u000d\u000a    The project began with 565 parents of school age children completing an\u000d\u000a      education policy questionnaire. They were then invited to participate in a\u000d\u000a      day devoted to debating possible changes to the education system involving\u000d\u000a      greater provision for sharing. In consultation with key stakeholders,\u000d\u000a      including the Department for Education Northern Ireland (DENI), the\u000d\u000a      project team developed balanced briefing materials, which were distributed\u000d\u000a      in advance to the 250 parents who indicated they were willing to\u000d\u000a      participate. On the day, 127 parents participated in small group\u000d\u000a      discussions and plenary sessions with an expert panel before completing\u000d\u000a      the same questionnaire a second time. The results of the second\u000d\u000a      (deliberative) poll were statistically compared with the results of the\u000d\u000a      first (conventional) poll.\u000d\u000a    The research demonstrated that deliberative polls could be successfully\u000d\u000a      conducted in divided societies, with participants from different religious\u000d\u000a      groups being able to have respectful and constructive discussions, which\u000d\u000a      promoted mutual understanding. The deliberation day also increased\u000d\u000a      participants' factual knowledge about Northern Ireland's education system\u000d\u000a      [2, p.32]. The deliberative poll showed: (1) majority support for various\u000d\u000a      forms of sharing in education; (2) support for some forms of sharing (e.g.\u000d\u000a      partnering with neighbouring schools of another religious denomination)\u000d\u000a      was significantly higher after deliberation [2, p.22]; (3) significantly\u000d\u000a      more participants from both communities perceived members of the other\u000d\u000a      community to be `open to reason' and `trustworthy' after deliberation [2,\u000d\u000a      pp.34-7].\u000d\u000a    The initial results of the project were first published in 2007 [2] with\u000d\u000a      further analyses conducted as part of an EU-funded project on shared\u000d\u000a      education in 2008 [3] and a fuller consideration of the effects of\u000d\u000a      deliberation in a 2013 Political Studies article [4]. The results\u000d\u000a      of the project were also disseminated to non-academic audiences through a\u000d\u000a      BBC Northern Ireland Hearts and Minds documentary (2007), national\u000d\u000a      and international media coverage (2007-9) and presentations to DENI,\u000d\u000a      Belfast City Council and other organisations (2007).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21704","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Clark's research on the 2012 elections had direct effects on:\u000a    \u000a      the recommendations of the Scottish Parliament's Local Government and\u000a        Regeneration\u000a        Committee's inquiry into the 2012 Scottish Local Government Elections;\u000a        and\u000a      the campaign strategy of some Scottish National Party candidates and\u000a        agents.\u000a    \u000a    Informing the Electoral Process\u000a    First, Clark's research directly influenced the recommendations made in\u000a      the Scottish Parliament's\u000a      Local Government and Regeneration Committee's Report on the 2012\u000a        Scottish Local Government\u000a        Elections (June 2013) [IMP1]. The aim of the Committee's inquiry was\u000a      to review the 2012 elections\u000a      and make recommendations to the Scottish Government for measures to\u000a      enhance local\u000a      democracy. Clark's research contributed directly to the Committee's\u000a      inquiry in four main ways:\u000a    (i) A pre-publication version of Clark (2013) [1] was included in the\u000a      briefing papers for the\u000a      initial Committee session in November 2012 [IMP2];\u000a    (ii) Clark was the only academic researcher invited to give expert oral\u000a      evidence to the\u000a      Committee in November 2012 [IMP3];\u000a    (iii) Clark submitted additional written evidence to the inquiry in March\u000a      2013 [IMP4];\u000a    (iv) Clark was further invited to an extended meeting directly with the\u000a      MSPs acting as Reporters\u000a      for the Committee in March 2013 [IMP1, Annexe A, pp.28-32].\u000a    The Parliamentary Report [IMP1] explicitly cites Clark's evidence in\u000a      support of two\u000a      recommendations:\u000a    (1) It recommends that public information campaigns should be \"better\u000a      targeted at under-represented groups to assist with their inclusion in the\u000a      democratic process\" [IMP1, para.17].\u000a    The Report explicitly states that this recommendation is directly\u000a      informed by Clark's evidence in\u000a      his meeting with the Reporters: \"Dr Alistair Clark from Newcastle\u000a      University told us that it may\u000a      be easier to identify the reasons for low voter turnout in areas once 2011\u000a      census data is\u000a      available and suggested a need to engage better and more often with\u000a      student, ethnic minority\u000a      and itinerant populations\" [IMP1, para.16].\u000a    (2) It recommends that an alternative to alphabetical ordering of\u000a      candidates on ballot papers\u000a      should be \"looked at in time for the 2017 Scottish local government\u000a      elections\" and that the\u000a      Electoral Commission uses \"opportunities that arise in the interim period\u000a      to trial potential\u000a      solutions\" [IMP1, para.109]. In paragraphs 105-7, the Report\u000a      refers to Clark's written evidence\u000a      as well as his meeting with the Reporters. In particular, it cites his\u000a      finding that there was a\u000a      significant statistical relationship between ballot position and the\u000a      relative vote share of\u000a      candidates from the same party to support the argument that alphabetical\u000a      ordering\u000a      disadvantages some candidates [IMP1, para.106]. The Report also\u000a      emphasises that based on\u000a      his further examination of the ballot paper ordering issue [IMP4], Clark\u000a      \"suggested a degree of\u000a      caution in proceeding with any change\" [IMP1, para.107]. Moreover, this is\u000a      reflected in the\u000a      Committee's recommendation that different potential solutions should be\u000a      considered before\u000a      any decision is taken.\u000a    More generally, Clark's research re-assured the Committee that STV was\u000a      easy to use and turnout\u000a      was relatively high for standalone local elections as well as providing\u000a      more detailed analysis of how\u000a      STV had worked in practice. His work was described as \"very much\u000a      appreciated\" by John\u000a      McCormick, Electoral Commissioner for Scotland [IMP3, Col.1434].\u000a    Informing Party Strategy\u000a    Second, Clark's research also made a distinct and material contribution\u000a      to improving the\u000a      understanding of effective party strategy under STV among party agents and\u000a      candidates,\u000a      especially in the Scottish National Party (SNP). Success under STV depends\u000a      on strategic vote\u000a      management: parties and candidates need to understand how to maximise the\u000a      number of their\u000a      candidates who will be elected in each constituency. In 2007, the SNP were\u000a      widely regarded as\u000a      having failed to maximise the number of seats that they won by offering\u000a      too few candidates. To\u000a      help to avoid this problem in 2012, Clark was invited to deliver a\u000a      presentation on the operation of\u000a      the 2007 elections and his preliminary research on the build-up to the\u000a      2012 elections to a closed\u000a      party plenary session at the SNP Spring Conference (10th March\u000a      2012). The session was attended\u000a      by approximately 250 SNP candidates or their election agents. This\u000a      represents around 40% of all\u000a      SNP candidates (n=613), and almost all those in attendance at the\u000a      Conference, with the session\u000a      advertised in the programme as one \"all candidates and agents should\u000a      attend\" [IMP5].\u000a    Audience feedback from the session indicated that 79% of respondents\u000a      (n=161) agreed with the\u000a      statement: \"The session will inform how I campaign during the 2012 council\u000a      elections\" [IMP6]. In\u000a      their qualitative feedback, participants gave several specific examples of\u000a      how their campaign\u000a      strategy would change as a result of Clark's research [IMP7]:\u000a    \"Didn't really understand STV before. Will be campaigning for 2nd and 3rd\u000a      preferences as\u000a      well &#8212; thank you\"\u000a    \"Our campaign was very much based on the need to get voters for us 1 and\u000a      2. Now we\u000a      may have to chase votes 3 and 4, also\"\u000a    \"Will affect content of campaign literature &#8212; taking account of\u000a      inter-party transfers as well as\u000a      intra-party\"\u000a    \"I now have a much clearer understanding of STV and feel more confident\u000a      when\u000a      campaigning and explaining STV to voters and asking for their preferences\"\u000a    Other participants indicated that the session had reassured them that the\u000a      party strategy made\u000a      sense [IMP7]:\u000a    \"Has added a why to the how of STV campaigning &#8212; I now know precisely why\u000a      we are doing\u000a      things the way we are!\"\u000a    \"It removed my concerns over fielding two candidates and maybe splitting\u000a      the vote and\u000a      ending up with zero\"\u000a    Clark also organised a workshop open to all candidates and parties at the\u000a      Convention of Scottish\u000a      Local Authorities (COSLA) Conference Centre, Edinburgh (12th\u000a      March 2012) on Elections under\u000a        the Single Transferable Vote: A Workshop for Candidates and Councillors.\u000a      He presented his\u000a      research findings, with participation from the Electoral Reform Society\u000a      and the General Secretary\u000a      of Irish political party Fianna F&#225;il. Thirty candidates and councillors\u000a      attended with representatives\u000a      from all the major Scottish political parties and several minor parties,\u000a      including a team from the\u000a      Green Party, and Independents. In feedback, 60% of respondents (n=20)\u000a      agreed with the\u000a      statement: \"The session will inform how I campaign during the 2012 council\u000a      elections\" [IMP8].\u000a    In sum, Clark's research on the use of STV in Scottish local elections\u000a      has reached the key\u000a      Parliamentary Committee considering the process of local elections in\u000a      Scotland and has directly\u000a      informed their recommendations for changes to the electoral process. In\u000a      addition, approximately\u000a      1\/4 of SNP candidates or their agents (161\/613) indicated that Clark's\u000a      research would inform their\u000a      campaign strategy in the 2012 local government elections.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research on party and voter behaviour in the 2012 Scottish Local\u000a      Government elections\u000a      influenced the understanding and behaviour of two audiences.

STV is\u000a      a form of proportional representation, which uses preferential voting in\u000a      multi-member\u000a      constituencies. Candidates must achieve a quota (or proportion of the\u000a      votes) to be elected, which\u000a      is determined by dividing the number of people who have voted by the\u000a      number of positions to be\u000a      filled. Voters can rank as many candidates as they choose in order of\u000a      preference. If their first-preference candidate receives more than the\u000a      required quota or receives the lowest number of\u000a      votes, their vote is transferred to their second-preference candidate.\u000a      This can be repeated multiple\u000a      times so that third-, fourth- and even lower preferences may play an\u000a      important role in determining\u000a      which candidates are elected. Under STV, a single political party might\u000a      win more than one seat in a\u000a      multi-member constituency so a potentially effective strategy is to put\u000a      forward two or more\u000a      candidates. However, parties also need to think carefully about vote\u000a      management to maximise\u000a      their gains from both intra-party transfers (i.e. from candidates of the\u000a      same party) and inter-party\u000a      transfers (i.e. from candidates of another party).\u000a    STV remains a relatively unusual electoral system, which is currently\u000a      used in national or local\u000a      government elections in only a handful of countries. It was introduced for\u000a      Scottish local government\u000a      elections in 2007. In 2007, the local and Parliamentary elections, which\u000a      used different electoral\u000a      systems, were held on the same day. The 2012 elections were therefore the\u000a      first time that STV had\u000a      been used in stand-alone local elections in Scotland (or in Britain in\u000a      living memory). Therefore, the\u000a      effects of STV on party and voter behaviour should be clearer in the 2012\u000a      elections than they were\u000a      in the 2007 elections.\u000a    This research used aggregate ward-level data from the 2012 elections in\u000a      conjunction with\u000a      observation of the election campaign to examine parties' strategies and\u000a      voter behaviour. In\u000a      particular, it examined:\u000a    (i) to what extent parties put forward multiple candidates in\u000a      constituencies;\u000a    (ii) voter turnout;\u000a    (iii) the ability of voters to use STV;\u000a    (iv) the pattern of intra-party and inter-party vote transfers;\u000a    (v) whether the position of candidates on the ballot paper had an effect\u000a      on their share of the\u000a      vote.\u000a    The main findings were:\u000a    (1) Only the SNP and Labour put forward more than one candidate in a\u000a      large proportion of wards\u000a      (SNP: 69.6% of wards; Labour 48.1%) [1, pp.58-60].\u000a    (2) Voter turnout across Scotland was 39.8%, which compares favourably\u000a      with turnout in\u000a      standalone local elections in many other countries, including England.\u000a      There was considerable\u000a      variation between wards and surprisingly the lowest turnout was in two\u000a      wards in relatively\u000a      affluent Aberdeen. Further investigation of the potential causes of\u000a      variations in turnout should\u000a      be undertaken when demographic data from the 2011 census is available. It\u000a      may be that these\u000a      wards include relatively high numbers of students and itinerant workers\u000a      [1, p.58].\u000a    (3) Scottish voters do not seem to have difficulty using STV. This is\u000a      indicated by the low number of\u000a      ballots rejected (only 1.7% compared with 2% in the 2011 Northern Ireland\u000a      local government\u000a      election with an electorate much more used to STV) and the number of\u000a      voters taking the\u000a      opportunity to express more than one preference (81.3% of voters expressed\u000a      a second\u000a      preference and 52.6% of voters expressed a third preference) [1, pp.61-3].\u000a    (4) Vote transfer patterns indicate high levels of intra-party \"transfer\u000a      solidarity\": where any of the\u000a      four main parties ran two candidates, over 70% of surplus votes were\u000a      transferred from its first\u000a      to second candidate; where the SNP, Labour and Conservatives ran only one\u000a      candidate, over\u000a      30% of their voters did not express a second preference. The main\u000a      beneficiaries of inter-party\u000a      transfers were the SNP [1, pp.62, 64-5].\u000a    (5) There was a statistically significant relationship between position\u000a      on the ballot paper and the\u000a      number of first preferences a candidate received [1, p.65].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23135","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Greenwood's review of the EU Transparency Register (RR3)\u000a      attracted a significant blog\u000a      exchange in May 2013 between European Commission Vice-President Maro&#353;\u000a      &#352;ef&#269;ovi&#269; (IR-1) and\u000a      Transparency International's Europe Office (IR-2), each of which\u000a      cited the article extensively ahead\u000a      of the opening of the official review of the launch in June 2013.

A variety of Twitter traffic\u000a      accompanied the publication of RR3\u000a      and the blog exchange (available on request), including the Slovak embassy\u000a      in the UK. The BBC\u000a      Radio 4 programme series `File on 4' broadcast a programme on `Tobacco:\u000a      the Lobbyists' on\u000a      16.7.2013 which used statistics published in RR3 (http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-23330553).\u000a      The\u000a      impact has continued beyond the census period, with continuing\u000a      Commissioner citations at public\u000a      events (available on request).\u000a    The launch event of the third edition of Greenwood's Interest\u000a        Representation in the EU in\u000a      Brussels in 2011 featured the Vice-President of the European Commission,\u000a      Maro&#353; &#352;ef&#269;ovi&#269;, as\u000a      keynote speaker. The event was attended by around 100 people. Martin\u000a      Westlake, the Secretary\u000a      General of the European Economic and Social Committee, blogged positively\u000a      afterwards about his\u000a      attendance at the event (IR-3): \"What Justin and his guest\u000a        speaker had to say was of great\u000a        interest to me...a welcome reminder that there are others out there who\u000a        are trying to flesh out the\u000a        somewhat amorphous concept of participatory democracy.\"\u000a    In 2009 Greenwood was commissioned by the Jordi Pujol Foundation\u000a      (Catalonia) to write an\u000a      online article explaining the way in which the EU political system seeks\u000a      to use organised interests\u000a      as a pathway to a `participatory democracy'.

It was also posted on the blog of the Basque Ombudsman (IR-6)\u000a      and the Newsletter of the\u000a      Basque government (IR-7). One of his 2012 co-authored articles in\u000a      PEPS has also been cited in a\u000a      student blog on `Re-imagining Europe' (http:\/\/bigidea2025.com\/6-european-citizens-initiatiative\/\u000a      ).\u000a    Greenwood also held a Brussels workshop in October 2011 attended by 30\u000a      practitioners\u000a      from the regional offices to discuss preliminary results from the British\u000a      Academy sponsored\u000a      research. His impact on the `Brussels circuit' is reflected in the diverse\u000a      training\/seminar events he\u000a      has been commissioned to undertake. These include:-\u000a    \u000a      the External Relations Directorate of the European Commission for a\u000a        half day internal\u000a        training session on `Networking and lobbying' (Brussels, 2009) (26\u000a        participants);\u000a      the European Climate Change Foundation, as the keynote speaker at a\u000a        dedicated seminar\u000a        for their wider network of environmental organisations on NGO lobbying\u000a        in the EU, with the\u000a        Director of the WWF Brussels Policy Unit as discussant (Brussels,\u000a        February 2011; c. 25\u000a        participants);\u000a      the Government of Catalonia (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) also\u000a        commissioned training from\u000a        Greenwood at their Brussels office in September 2011 on `the role of\u000a        lobbying in EU decision\u000a        making' (Brussels, September 2011; c. 25 participants); (repeat\u000a        invitation for 2013 - event clash)\u000a      a day's training at the College of Europe Development Office\u000a        `Intensive Seminar on the\u000a        EU' (annually since 2002), and intermittent dedicated training events\u000a        run by the Development\u000a        Office (total attendance c. 900).\u000a    \u000a    Greenwood's regular courses on Masters programmes at the College of\u000a      Europe (where he\u000a      has been a Visiting Professor since 2002) on `Interest Representation in\u000a      the EU' and `Business\u000a      Politics in the EU' have assisted an estimated 50 ancien in their\u000a      subsequent employment in\u000a      organisations engaging with EU institutions. His earlier work on business\u000a      interest representation,\u000a      reflected in his Inside the EU Business Associations (Basingstoke:\u000a      Palgrave Macmillan, 2001),\u000a      has continued in impact terms through:\u000a    \u000a      a sustained Brussels `Euroconference' event bringing together\u000a        practitioners and academics\u000a        to share perspectives on EU business associations. Greenwood established\u000a        the event with two\u000a        conferences in 2000 and 2002 from an EU Framework Programme `High Level\u000a        Scientific\u000a        Conference' series grant, bringing together 300 participants over both\u000a        events, and subsequently\u000a        passed the event over to a Brussels-based association management\u000a        company, Kellen Europe, to\u000a        operate on an annual basis (IR-8);\u000a      a co-facilitator role at a member event of the EU engineering\u000a        association Orgalime in\u000a        2008, jointly with a PhD student\/Brussels practitioner (c. 30\u000a        participants);\u000a      membership of the CBI Trade Association Forum (TAF) Final Awards\u000a        judging panel (IR-9).\u000a        The awards are aimed at developing best practice in a variety of\u000a        categories; he has been invited to\u000a        serve on the panel every year since 2003;\u000a      a keynote speaker role at the TAF Annual Conference in 2011 (estimated\u000a        audience: 150).\u000a    \u000a    Greenwood was a member of an ESRC awards panel (2006-2010) designed to\u000a      incentivise\u000a      training by postgraduate research students in Advanced Quantitative\u000a      Research Methods. This\u000a      resulted in him being commissioned by ESRC to evaluate the scheme and to\u000a      make policy\u000a      recommendations. The implementation of these is documented in an email\u000a      sent to panel members\u000a      of 5 February 2009 (available on request &#8212; CI 2) by the\u000a      responsible departmental head at ESRC,\u000a      entitled `Follow on to the Greenwood Report'. The changes include an\u000a      increase in the amount of\u000a      the training grant element, the removal of the award from the first year\u000a      of study (when students are\u000a      developing their ideas), and the concentration of studentships in centres\u000a      with high quality\u000a      quantitative training.\u000a    Halpin's research on lobbying by organized interests led to an\u000a      invitation from the Organization for\u000a      Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to be a panel member at a\u000a      workshop on the\u000a      `Economic and Trade Implications of Policy Responses to Societal Concerns'\u000a      in 2009 (IR-10) (and\u000a      beyond the census period at the Australian Parliament on lobby\u000a      regulation). The Scottish Council\u000a      for Voluntary Organisations invited him to give an extended presentation\u000a      to the Policy Officers\u000a      Forum on 27 August 2009. Results were also discussed with the Scottish\u000a      Government's Office of\u000a      the Chief Researcher and the Constitutional Policy and Civic Participation\u000a      Team on 15 January\u000a      2008. Results were requested by the Scottish Government Library Service\u000a      (on behalf of the\u000a      Cabinet Communications Division) on 20 February 2011.

It has also\u000d\u000a      informed the policy debates on the petitions system in Westminster.\u000d\u000a    Influence on Scottish Parliament Petitions process\u000d\u000a      Carman submitted his final report on Assessment of the Scottish\u000d\u000a        Parliament's Public Petitions System 1999-2006 (`the Report') to the\u000d\u000a      PPC in October 2006. The report was launched by the PPC at its meeting of\u000d\u000a      30 October 2006 [1] during which PPC members commented on the\u000d\u000a      helpful and stimulating nature of the report. The PPC also acknowledged\u000d\u000a      the equality issues identified by Carman in the report relating to the\u000d\u000a      sectors of society who were most likely to lodge petitions. Noting this in\u000d\u000a      the discussions, members of the PPC commented that it raised important\u000d\u000a      issues about improving the public petitions process; members suggested\u000d\u000a      that the report would provide an evidence base for the PCC's successors\u000d\u000a      following the 2007 General Election.\u000d\u000a    In June 2008, following the previous year's General Election, the new\u000d\u000a      members of the PPC launched an inquiry into the public petitions process.\u000d\u000a      Both the minutes of the PPC's meeting of 24 June 2008 [2] and the\u000d\u000a      final report of the inquiry, published on 16 June 2009 [3],\u000d\u000a      demonstrate that the PCC was motivated to undertake the year-long inquiry\u000d\u000a      in order to engage with the findings and recommendations made in Carman's\u000d\u000a      2006 University of Glasgow-based research.\u000d\u000a    The PPC launched the inquiry on 24 June 2008 with the aim of\u000d\u000a      investigating how to improve awareness of the existence of the public\u000d\u000a      petitions process, particularly amongst hard to reach groups;\u000d\u000a      participation in the process itself; and the scrutiny role fulfilled by\u000d\u000a      the PCC, issues which had been highlighted in the 2006 research. By\u000d\u000a      adopting this remit, the PPC sought to identify and implement improvements\u000d\u000a      to the public petitions process that would be of benefit to all its key\u000d\u000a      stakeholders: potential and actual petitioners, the PCC, the wider\u000d\u000a      Parliament including other committees, and public bodies in Scotland\u000d\u000a      including the Scottish Government.\u000d\u000a    As part of the year-long inquiry, the PCC analysed written responses from\u000d\u000a      43 NGOs, public bodies, individuals, and charities. Additionally, it held\u000d\u000a      public meetings in Duns, Easterhouse, Fraserburgh, and Edinburgh between\u000d\u000a      December 2008 and April 2009.\u000d\u000a    In his written response for the inquiry, Carman examined the key issues\u000d\u000a      raised by the PPC in light of the data and findings from his 2006\u000d\u000a      research. Carman recommended, among other things, that the PCC should\u000d\u000a      commission further research into the extent of public awareness of the\u000d\u000a      petitions system prior to developing an awareness campaign; the PPC\u000d\u000a      subsequently commissioned research on public awareness of, and engagement\u000d\u000a      with, the petitions process as part of the inquiry.\u000d\u000a    The PCC published its report on the inquiry into the public petitions\u000d\u000a      process on 16 June 2009. Among its key findings the report revealed a\u000d\u000a      widespread ignorance of the remit of the Scottish Parliament and a\u000d\u000a      perception that it held little power. The report also found that, as a\u000d\u000a      direct result of this, the public was not well informed about the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Parliament's public petitions process. The PPC therefore made several\u000d\u000a      recommendations for improvements in the report in relation to public\u000d\u000a      awareness and understandings of the public petitions process that had been\u000d\u000a      highlighted in Carman's 2006 research. It acknowledged that the\u000d\u000a      promotional material of the PPC should be redesigned to make it more\u000d\u000a      accessible and attractive to disengaged audiences; that a wider range of\u000d\u000a      communication methods should be used to publicise the petitions process;\u000d\u000a      that web-based tools linked to awareness and use of the petitions process\u000d\u000a      should be improved and extended; and that there should be greater\u000d\u000a      engagement with local government enabling members of local councils etc.\u000d\u000a      to signpost constituents to the petitions process, where appropriate.\u000d\u000a    The Scottish Government and The Scottish Parliament Corporate Body\u000d\u000a      responded to the report in July 2009 [4]; it was subsequently debated in\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Parliament in September 2009, following which several of the\u000d\u000a      PPC's final recommendations were implemented, including: a complete\u000d\u000a      revision of public engagement flyers and documentation to reduce the\u000d\u000a      amount of information included in the leaflets and make them available in\u000d\u000a      more languages; and the adoption of online and social media, including\u000d\u000a      Wikipedia, YouTube and Twitter (@SP_Petitions) as a means of reaching\u000d\u000a      groups that may be unaware of the petitions process and who use social\u000d\u000a      media on a daily basis. The PPC also redesigned the layout of its web\u000d\u000a      pages to make them more accessible for people of all ages and abilities.\u000d\u000a      In addition, the PPC produced a new film providing information about the\u000d\u000a      petitions process and an animated guide on how to complete a petition [5].\u000d\u000a    These outcomes confirmed the findings in Carman's 2006 research which had\u000d\u000a      prompted the Public Petitions Committee's inquiry.\u000d\u000a    HM Government's Petitions System\u000d\u000a\u0009  Beyond Scotland, Carman's\u000d\u000a      research has been widely referenced in the ongoing discussions on reform\u000d\u000a      of the HM Government's petitions system. Those discussions have been held\u000d\u000a      with the aim of producing recommendations to make the procedures for\u000d\u000a      petitions more accessible and transparent and better able to meet the\u000d\u000a      reasonable expectations of those members of the public who engage with the\u000d\u000a      process.\u000d\u000a    Carman's 2006 report was widely cited by the House of Commons Library,\u000d\u000a      which provides research and analysis for Members of Parliament, in its\u000d\u000a      2010 briefings on Proposals for a Public Petitions Committee and Proposals\u000a        for an e-petitions process for the House of Commons (published in\u000d\u000a      March and February 2010) [6]. The Library drew from Carman's\u000d\u000a      findings on the Scottish public petitions process in both briefings to\u000d\u000a      inform the House of Commons about processes in other legislatures when\u000d\u000a      considering how similar systems might be introduced at Westminster.\u000d\u000a    On the basis of his in-depth research into the Scottish petitions system\u000d\u000a      in 2006, Carman was invited to participate in a seminar in Whitehall\u000d\u000a      facilitated by the House of Commons Backbench Business Committee (BBC) on\u000d\u000a      6 March 2012. The BBC is a cross-party committee which schedules subjects\u000d\u000a      for debate suggested by backbench MPs, and the Hansard Society (HS), the\u000d\u000a      UK's leading independent, non-partisan political research and education\u000d\u000a      charity.\u000d\u000a    Carman explained his 2006 research findings to the BBC and assisted the\u000d\u000a      deliberations on revisions to HM Government's petitions system following\u000d\u000a      the launch of an e-petitions system in August 2011. As a result of this\u000d\u000a      consultation, HS identified a number of problems that threatened to\u000d\u000a      undermine the e-petition system's effectiveness and which, if not\u000d\u000a      addressed, risked reputational damage to the House of Commons in\u000d\u000a      particular, and an exacerbation of public disillusionment with the\u000d\u000a      political system in the long-term.\u000d\u000a    HS further recognised that most other legislatures, including Scotland,\u000d\u000a      have a unified petitions system that allows for different routes of\u000d\u000a      submission for petitioners, i.e. either in paper form or electronically.\u000d\u000a      HS believed that by introducing a separate system of e-petitions for the\u000d\u000a      UK Parliament, those without internet access may be disadvantaged. On this\u000d\u000a      basis, it was concerned that this might affect perceived fairness of the\u000d\u000a      e-petitions system among the public and those submitting petitions. Carman\u000d\u000a      had raised the problem with the perceived fairness of the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Parliament's petitions process, and public engagement with it, in his 2006\u000d\u000a      Report. The Hansard Society relied on Carman's research findings from both\u000d\u000a      his 2006 Report and the evidence he provided at the seminar on 6 March\u000d\u000a      2012 in its final report about the e-petitions system, where it directly\u000d\u000a      quoted his contributions:\u000d\u000a    `...research on procedural justice and public perceptions of political\u000d\u000a        processes, `provides unmitigated evidence that individual-level\u000d\u000a        evaluations of how `fair' (or `unfair') a political process is have a\u000d\u000a        very strong influence on the willingness to accept the outcomes of these\u000d\u000a        processes' and thus `individuals are often willing to accept outcomes\u000d\u000a        they do not prefer if they believe the outcomes were derived through a\u000d\u000a        fair process' [7].\u000d\u000a    HS was keen to discuss the establishment of a Public Petitions Committee\u000d\u000a      similar to Scotland's and which Carman examined in his 2006 report. On the\u000d\u000a      basis of Carman's and others' evidence, HS recommended the establishment\u000d\u000a      of a Petitions Committee, supported by staff in a Petitions Office. The\u000d\u000a      Procedures Committee for the House of Commons, which considers the\u000d\u000a      practice and procedure of the House in the conduct of public business,\u000d\u000a      rejected the proposal to introduce a Petitions Committee but discussions\u000d\u000a      around this are ongoing within the House of Commons.\u000d\u000a    Carman's University of Glasgow research thus continues to impact upon\u000d\u000a      continuing developments to the UK Parliament's Public Petitions Process.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    University of Glasgow research on the Scottish Parliament's public\u000d\u000a      petitions system directly influenced processes for petition consideration\u000d\u000a      through the production of a review of the petitions process, which\u000d\u000a      prompted a year-long inquiry.

Designed to increase the openness, transparency and\u000d\u000a      accountability of the Parliament, Scotland's public petitions system is\u000d\u000a      somewhat unique, allowing virtually anyone to petition the Parliament on\u000d\u000a      any matter that is related to the Parliament's devolved powers. In theory,\u000d\u000a      then, the system creates a mechanism for almost unparalleled public\u000d\u000a      involvement not only in the law-making process, but also in the evaluation\u000d\u000a      and scrutiny of policy outputs and outcomes.\u000d\u000a    For scholars of public opinion, political representation and public\u000d\u000a      engagement, the petitions system provides an unrivalled natural experiment\u000d\u000a      in civic responsiveness to political processes. To tap this potential,\u000d\u000a      Christopher Carman (then Senior Lecturer at the University of Glasgow)\u000d\u000a      initiated an extended research project in 2006, entitled `Implementing\u000d\u000a        the Buzzwords and Connecting with the Public: An Assessment of the\u000d\u000a        Scottish Parliament's Public Petitions Processes,' with funding from\u000d\u000a      the ESRC (RES-000-22-1820-A). The ESRC grant funded a postal survey of\u000d\u000a      everyone who submitted petitions to the Scottish Parliament, as well as a\u000d\u000a      series of in-depth interviews with petitioners. The particular focus of\u000d\u000a      the project was to develop an understanding of how individuals'\u000d\u000a      assessments of political processes influence their evaluations of the\u000d\u000a      petitions system and wider diffuse support for political institutions.\u000d\u000a      Additional issues addressed in the research related to the influence of\u000d\u000a      petitions in the Parliament's consideration of legislation and its\u000d\u000a      scrutiny of the Scottish Government. The research built on Carman's body\u000d\u000a      of work on political representation and public perceptions of political\u000d\u000a      representatives and processes, and voting procedures.\u000d\u000a    Shortly following the award of the ESRC grant, the Public Petitions\u000d\u000a      Committee (PPC) announced a similar review of the petitions system. Carman\u000d\u000a      was granted the tender for the review, producing an extensive report for\u000d\u000a      the PPC entitled, `An Assessment of the Public Petitions Process,\u000d\u000a        1999-2006'.\u000d\u000a    The review demonstrated that the PPC had significantly changed since the\u000d\u000a      first session of the Scottish Parliament, attributing this change in\u000d\u000a      function and role to the need to find a balance between efficiency and\u000d\u000a      effectiveness. The research pointed out that this was an important balance\u000d\u000a      to strike given the resource-intensive nature of the public petitions\u000d\u000a      process and emphasised that the process had to ensure that it was\u000d\u000a      efficient and effective in order to meet the needs of the petitioners and\u000d\u000a      maintain its integrity. The review also identified several issues which\u000d\u000a      raised difficulties around achieving this balance among them the fact that\u000d\u000a      the petitions system was predominantly used by older, middle-class,\u000d\u000a      educated men, meaning that the petitions process provided an avenue for\u000d\u000a      certain segments of society to voice their concerns while not offering the\u000d\u000a      same opportunity to others.\u000d\u000a    Carman argued in the final report that in order for there to be a\u000d\u000a      meaningful and effective petitions process, it should attempt to connect\u000d\u000a      with all the people of Scotland. To this end, the report recognised\u000d\u000a      previous attempts by the PPC to engage with the public through road show\u000d\u000a      events and suggested the possibility of further outreach activities\u000d\u000a      specifically targeting certain geographical areas to enhance social\u000d\u000a      inclusion and engagement with the petitions system.\u000d\u000a    In addition to the lack of use of the petitions system by a broad section\u000d\u000a      of Scottish society, the research also identified further difficulties in\u000d\u000a      maintaining the balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The research\u000d\u000a      also demonstrated that many petitioners felt they were not kept aware of\u000d\u000a      communications between Committees as part of the consideration of their\u000d\u000a      Petition. The report further concluded that these aspects of the process\u000d\u000a      may undermine the perceived fairness, transparency and openness of the\u000d\u000a      petitions system.\u000d\u000a    Carman moved to the University of Strathclyde from 2007-2012 before\u000d\u000a      returning to Glasgow University in January 2013. The impact from the\u000d\u000a      research described here will therefore focus on his 2006 research\u000d\u000a      undertaken at the University of Glasgow on behalf of the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Parliament's Public Petitions Committee.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23657","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Chantal Mouffe's ideas on agonistic democracy have had an impact most\u000d\u000a      profoundly on the governing strategy of the current Argentinian president\u000d\u000a      and the surrounding public debate, but also within Belgium where she has\u000d\u000a      affected both the political response to far-right parties and the work of\u000d\u000a      the artistic community.\u000d\u000a    The work of Chantal Mouffe (together with Ernesto Laclau) is widely\u000d\u000a      credited by both political actors and the media within Argentina as being\u000d\u000a      one of the main intellectual resources for what has been termed the National\u000d\u000a        and Popular Model of Democracy (NPMD) that has dominated Argentinian\u000d\u000a      politics over the last decade. Both the current president Cristina\u000d\u000a      Fernandez de Kirchner (elected December 2007; re-elected 2011) and the\u000d\u000a      previous incumbent Nestor Kirchner (20003-2007) have publicly recognised\u000d\u000a      that they have read and been influenced by Mouffe and many journalists\u000d\u000a      report on her frequent visits to the Casa Rosada, the presidential palace\u000d\u000a      in Buenos Aires (1).\u000d\u000a    An article in Clar&#237;n (the largest newspaper in Argentina;\u000d\u000a      centre-right; and recognised as a leading element in the opposition to\u000d\u000a      Kirchner) states that `Chantal Mouffe is Cristina's [Kirchner] favourite\u000d\u000a      intellectual... Mouffe has been sustaining a theory to which the President\u000d\u000a      adheres' (2). Similarly, the more conservative newspaper La Naci&#243;n\u000d\u000a      (second largest circulation; anti-Kirchner) emphasizes that `the Kirchners\u000d\u000a      are admirers' (3). Across newspapers of varying political perspective,\u000d\u000a      there is recognition of the particular importance of the book On the\u000d\u000a        Political: P&#225;gina\/12 (main progressive left newspaper)\u000d\u000a      states that it is `a book that the President has well read' (4). La\u000d\u000a        Naci&#243;n goes even further: `On the Political altered\u000d\u000a      Kirchner's life as a politician forever, according to what close\u000d\u000a      acquaintances of the President told La Naci&#243;n' (5).\u000d\u000a    Mouffe's particular influence, highlighted by opponents and supporters,\u000d\u000a      relates to the highly contested political strategies and policies of the\u000d\u000a      Kirchner presidency in the field of human rights, social protection and\u000d\u000a      civil liberties. Commentators draw a direct relationship between Mouffe's\u000d\u000a      work on agonistic democracy and the way in which the Kirchners constructed\u000d\u000a      an idea of the pueblo in active opposition to `the elite',\u000d\u000a      supporters of neoliberalism and\/or the `old politics' in Argentina. P&#225;gina\/12\u000d\u000a      goes as far as to directly quote a passage from On the Political\u000d\u000a      to prove its point (4). Such a confrontational strategy can be witnessed\u000d\u000a      across a range of legislative and policy issues that goes back to 2003\u000d\u000a      with the legislation annulling the amnesty laws (from 1983) that had\u000d\u000a      benefitted members of the military government of the last dictatorship. In\u000d\u000a      the 2008-13 period, the government has engaged in a number of\u000d\u000a      confrontational strategies that are explicitly linked to NPMD and thus\u000d\u000a      influenced by Mouffe's political philosophy, including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the attempted reform in the export taxes of agricultural products\u000d\u000a        implemented by Presidential Decree in the beginning of 2008 (later\u000d\u000a        narrowly revoked by the Senate). The government built a strong alliance\u000d\u000a        of forces and popular mobilizations against agricultural producers that\u000d\u000a        were presented as associated with the elites and defenders of a system\u000d\u000a        that benefitted only a few. The lively debate in Parliament was followed\u000d\u000a        on public screens in the main cities.\u000d\u000a      the reform of the National Broadcasting Law in 2009 followed a similar\u000d\u000a        logic with the government setting itself in direct opposition with Media\u000d\u000a        Grupo Clar&#237;n that controlled large proportions of the radio, TV and\u000d\u000a        newspapers in Argentina. The strategy included massive mobilisations,\u000d\u000a        public consultations across the country and, again, public viewings of\u000d\u000a        the parliamentary debates.\u000d\u000a      the reform of the Civil Code to allow same-sex marriages in 2010,\u000d\u000a        which in this case led to direct confrontation with the Catholic Church,\u000d\u000a        generated extremely high levels of political mobilization, particularly\u000d\u000a        amongst the young.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In explaining the political strategy of the NPMD, commentators are quick\u000d\u000a      to make the link with Mouffe's ideas: `Far from the discourse that insists\u000d\u000a      on the need to achieve a great national consensus - without establishing\u000d\u000a      what for - Kirchnerism prefers to explore the agitated waters of\u000d\u000a      antagonism, and the results are evident' (5). A second article in La\u000d\u000a        Naci&#243;n similarly explaining how Mouffe's ideas have been influential\u000d\u000a      on Kirchner's political strategy: `the existence of antagonism is\u000d\u000a      fundamental, the demarcation of an `us' and `them as a necessary condition\u000d\u000a      for the exercise of democratic rights... permanent conflict enables the\u000d\u000a      constitution of an hegemonic power that breaks with the status quo and\u000d\u000a      breaks the power of deadlock' (6).\u000d\u000a    Beyond the direct influence on the presidency, Mouffe's ideas are widely\u000d\u000a      publicized in Argentina: an interview with P&#225;gina\/12 (7) in which\u000d\u000a      Mouffe discusses the way in which Europe can learn from the politics of\u000d\u000a      Latin America was then picked up a few weeks later in an article by La\u000d\u000a        Naci&#243;n (8). The Argentinian Ambassador to the United Kingdom has\u000d\u000a      provided personal testimony as to the impact of Mouffe's work on both the\u000d\u000a      President and contemporary Argentinian political culture more generally\u000d\u000a      and is willing to speak to the REF panel to confirm this account (1).\u000d\u000a    The impact of Mouffe's work is not only in Latin America, but also in her\u000d\u000a      native Belgium. Here political actors have again referred to the way that\u000d\u000a      her work on agonism has shaped their response to the rise of the extremist\u000d\u000a      right. She has contributed to the public debate on the far right through\u000d\u000a      radio (Radio Klara) and magazine (Knack and Le Vif)\u000d\u000a      interviews and De Standaard ran an article `Viva Chantal' in\u000d\u000a      November 2011 (9). Her influence is not simply on political debate, but\u000d\u000a      also contemporary cultural activities. Mouffe has frequently given talks\u000d\u000a      on the relationship between agonistic democracy and the arts (often at\u000d\u000a      museums and art galleries), culminating in 2012 with an invited month-long\u000d\u000a      residency in the annual Kunstenfestivaldesarts in Brussels where she\u000d\u000a      interacted with artists (in particular a dance company that drew\u000d\u000a      inspiration from her work on agonism) and gave a keynote public lecture\u000d\u000a      (10).\u000d\u000a    While critics often contend that contemporary democratic theory is\u000d\u000a      divorced from political practice, Mouffe has clearly demonstrated its\u000d\u000a      relevance to contemporary political life.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Chantal Mouffe's insights on agonistic democracy have had significant\u000d\u000a      impact on political discourse, policy and political strategy, most\u000d\u000a      obviously as an intellectual resource for the approach to governing\u000d\u000a      instigated by the Argentinian President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner,\u000d\u000a      often referred to as the National and Popular Model of Democracy.\u000d\u000a      The actions of key actors in the governing regime have been influenced by\u000d\u000a      reading her work and interacting directly with Mouffe. This is the subject\u000d\u000a      of heated discussions in news media of all political persuasions. Mouffe's\u000d\u000a      analysis of right-wing populism has also affected the political position\u000d\u000a      and strategy of politicians in Belgium, informing debates on how to resist\u000d\u000a      the growth of extreme right-wing parties. Beyond mainstream politics, she\u000d\u000a      has shaped the work of artists: for example, through her invited residency\u000d\u000a      at the Kunstenfestivaldesarts in Brussels.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Westminster\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Westminster (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Westminster","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007165}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3435910","Name":"Buenos Aires"},{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aMouffe, C.

Her insights were formulated\u000d\u000a      through a series of books and essays during the period that she worked at\u000d\u000a      the Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD) at the University of\u000d\u000a      Westminster, a research centre that is internationally recognised for its\u000d\u000a      work on contemporary democratic theory. The intellectual culture of CSD\u000d\u000a      has played a significant role in the development and dissemination of\u000d\u000a      Mouffe's ideas, in particular her interactions with significant political\u000d\u000a      theorists such as John Keane who established CSD and the hosting of major\u000d\u000a      international theorists for the prestigious CSD Encounters, such\u000d\u000a      as Charles Taylor, Richard Rorty and Judith Butler. This tradition of\u000d\u000a      critical and politically-engaged democratic theory continues to be central\u000d\u000a      to the mission of CSD, with recent appointments such as Paulina Tambakaki\u000d\u000a      (who completed her PhD under the supervision of Mouffe), and Ricardo Blaug\u000d\u000a      (see REF 3a for examples of impact activity). Chantal Mouffe continues to\u000d\u000a      contribute to the intellectual life of CSD as an Emeritus Professor.\u000d\u000a    Mouffe's most prominent publications include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aThe Return of the Political (Verso, 1993): 1843 citations on\u000d\u000a        Google Scholar (as of 4 October 2013); `Evocative and challenging' (Radical\u000d\u000a          Philosophy); `An indispensable read' (Harvard Educational\u000d\u000a          Review).\u000d\u000a      \u000aThe Democratic Paradox (Verso, 2000): 1991 citations;\u000d\u000a        `Important and timely' (Political Theory)\u000d\u000a      \u000aOn the Political (Routledge, 2005): 1506 citations. `Mouffe\u000d\u000a        represents a position that every serious student of contemporary\u000d\u000a        political thought must acknowledge' (The Philosophers' Magazine)\u000d\u000a      And most recently Agonistics (Verso, 2013)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In these works &#8212; which have been translated into Spanish as well as many\u000d\u000a      other languages &#8212; Mouffe develops the agonistic model of democracy as an\u000d\u000a      alternative to the two currently dominant approaches: the aggregative and\u000d\u000a      the deliberative. Mouffe's research seeks to move pluralist conflict from\u000d\u000a      `antagonism' (a struggle between enemies) to `agonism' (a struggle between\u000d\u000a      adversaries). For Mouffe, the construction of an `us' and a `them' is\u000d\u000a      constitutive of politics: the crucial issue for democracy is how to\u000d\u000a      establish this us\/them distinction in a way which is compatible with the\u000d\u000a      recognition of pluralism. A well-functioning democracy calls for a\u000d\u000a      confrontation of democratic political positions. If this is missing there\u000d\u000a      is always the danger that democratic confrontation will be replaced by a\u000d\u000a      confrontation between non-negotiable moral values or essentialist forms of\u000d\u000a      identifications.\u000d\u000a    In developing the practical political implications of this agonistic\u000d\u000a      approach, Mouffe has shown the negative consequences for democratic\u000d\u000a      politics of attempts to assert that the partisan view of politics had\u000d\u000a      become obsolete and that the left\/right distinction should be (or has\u000d\u000a      been) overcome. If conflicts cannot take an agonistic form, they are more\u000d\u000a      likely to emerge in an antagonistic manner that represents a danger to the\u000d\u000a      very survival of liberal-democratic societies. For Mouffe, the lack of a\u000d\u000a      real difference between the politics of centre-right and centre-left\u000d\u000a      parties is at the origin of the growing success of right-wing populist\u000d\u000a      parties.\u000d\u000a    Chantal Mouffe's work has itself been the subject of two book length\u000d\u000a      treatments, most recently the edited collection Chantal Mouffe:\u000d\u000a        Hegemony, Radical Democracy and the Political (edited by James\u000d\u000a      Martin, Routledge, 2013).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23698","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1252634","Name":"Bhutan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Anand is a much sought after commentator on political issues related to\u000a      Tibet and the wider\u000a      Himalayan region, contributing to and affecting public discourse through\u000a      numerous interviews and\u000a      citations in international media and active presence on social media: he\u000a      has been termed the\u000a      `Facebook professor' (1). His opinion is also sought by officials in the\u000a      Tibetan Government in Exile,\u000a      India, China, EU, UK and US in the development of their policy positions.\u000a      His standing was\u000a      reinforced by the Dalai Lama's decision to hold a public talk in the UK in\u000a      2012 at the University of\u000a      Westminster following an invitation from Anand when he chaired a\u000a      closed-door session earlier in\u000a      2011 in Helsinki.\u000a    Anand first came to public prominence following the eruption of protests\u000a      in Chinese-\u000a      controlled Tibet in 2008. He was interviewed on BBC TV, Al Jazeera, BBC\u000a      World Service, various\u000a      radio stations in USA and Canada and his views were solicited by the New\u000a      York Times, the Asia\u000a      Times, The Independent and Asahi Simbum (Japan). He was commissioned to\u000a      write articles by the\u000a      Guardian, Singapore Straits Times, Times of India and The Hindu. He was\u000a      particularly prominent in\u000a      debates about self-immolation as a form of protest since 2011, where an\u000a      article critical of the\u000a      practice commissioned by the Guardian (2) was republished by Outlook India\u000a      (the largest\u000a      circulation magazine in the sub-continent) and led to a commissioned\u000a      article by the New\u000a      Internationalist, an interview with Zee News (3) (a popular Indian TV\u000a      station) and public talks\u000a      organised by student organisations, activist groups and monasteries in\u000a      India and the UK.\u000a    Anand was commissioned in 2013 by the Europe China Research and Advice\u000a      Network\u000a      (ECRAN) to write a policy paper `The Self-Immolation Crisis in Chinese\u000a      Controlled Tibet'. ECRAN\u000a      provides policy reports to the European External Action Service (EEAS) and\u000a      the 28 member states\u000a      of the European Union. According to the ECRAN Team Leader and Director of\u000a      the Chinese Study\u000a      Centre at the University of Sydney, the impact of the report has been\u000a      high: `it had direct impact on\u000a      the policy thinking of a huge community of diplomats, and officials,\u000a      across the EU, and located in\u000a      China... The feedback from the EEAS that we received afterwards was very\u000a      complimentary, and it\u000a      had evidently helped them think through more deeply issues in this complex\u000a      area. I would therefore\u000a      say that Dr Anand's paper had very high policy impact.' (4)\u000a    Anand's profile increased further when he made a public interjection in\u000a      response to the\u000a      controversy around the Karmapa Lama (the second highest ranking Tibetan\u000a      religious leader in\u000a      exile in India). Following the false accusation by the Indian media that\u000a      Karmapa was a Chinese spy\u000a      in February 2011, Anand was commissioned to write an article by the\u000a      Hindustan Times (5), shared\u000a      by more than 2000 people on Facebook and read online by more than 25,000\u000a      people within the\u000a      first two days. This was quickly followed by an interview on Zee News and\u000a      a second article\u000a      commissioned by Kafila (an alternative media website). These interventions\u000a      received significant\u000a      attention well beyond India, with citations in articles in Time World,\u000a      Chinese and Korean media and\u000a      on Tibetan activist websites. Anand was approached by Indian government\u000a      officials to substantiate\u000a      his views and was thanked by the Karmapa's office in India and invited to\u000a      meet him personally in\u000a      December 2011.\u000a    Anand is frequently invited to give policy advice in face-to-face\u000a      meetings with officials on\u000a      Tibet and wider issues related to the Himalayan region, for example with\u000a      individuals in the Tibetan\u000a      Government in Exile (including audiences with the Dalai Lama in\u000a      Dharamsala), Foreign and\u000a      Commonwealth Office, Chinese Foreign Ministry and the US Congressional\u000a      Research Service. The\u000a      Head of the Asia Pacific Research Group at the FCO, who meets with Anand\u000a      regularly, is highly\u000a      complimentary of his `timely and carefully tailored advice... I find his\u000a      work balanced and nuanced in\u000a      a field where neither of these traits is common. He clearly has a very\u000a      strong network of academic\u000a      and Government contacts in the region which I think are unparalleled in\u000a      the UK. It is extremely\u000a      helpful for the FCO to be able to tap into these contacts through Dr.\u000a      Anand... he has helped\u000a      deepen our understanding so that we can better nuance our approach' (6).\u000a      The UK Representative\u000a      of His Holiness the Dalai Lama states: `Dibyesh's prolific and objective\u000a      research and his ability to\u000a      engage with the Tibetan communities in London and India on various vital\u000a      issues including\u000a      challenges of survival and democratisation, self-immolations and\u000a      non-violent protests are\u000a      admirable and helpful' (7).\u000a    His reputation as a public commentator on Tibet and the broader Himalayan\u000a      region has led\u000a      to numerous invitations to speak to and visit think-tanks and other civil\u000a      society organisations,\u000a      including: in Delhi in 2012-13, the Foundation for Non Violent Action\u000a      (FNVA), the Institute of China\u000a      Studies and the Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis (IDSA); Bhutan\u000a      Society UK in 2011; and\u000a      visiting fellowships at the Centre for Bhutan Studies (CBS) in the summer\u000a      of 2012 and IDSA in\u000a      2013.\u000a    Anand is highly pro-active in his public engagement activities, through\u000a      organising events,\u000a      hosting delegations and social media. The most prominent event was clearly\u000a      the Dalai Lama's visit\u000a      to the University of Westminster (which was oversubscribed beyond the\u000a      packed audience of 500).\u000a      He also organised a public event on Kashmir and Tibet, involving two\u000a      prominent dissident\u000a      intellectuals: Wang Lixiong from China and Arundhati Roy from India. The\u000a      youtube video of his\u000a      discussion with Roy has received more than 22,000 hits. He has hosted\u000a      Chinese government\u000a      delegations on three separate occasions in 2008-10 (covered by Chinese and\u000a      exile newspapers).\u000a      His social media activities have been extensive, using Facebook and other\u000a      platforms to interact\u000a      with and on occasion mentor activists and writers. As the Deputy Program\u000a      Director at Students for\u000a      a Free Tibet in India states: `His illuminating research and talks not\u000a      only provided Tibetans\u000a      diaspora with greater understanding of possible challenges and\u000a      opportunities it might face in future\u000a      but also inspired and guided many aspiring Tibetan youngsters in their\u000a      educational pursuits' (8).\u000a    As his research broadens to other areas in the Himalayas, his impact on\u000a      public discourse\u000a      continues to develop. An opinion piece was commissioned on China-India\u000a      border disputes by the\u000a      Indian newspaper Seven Sisters Post in 2011 and his views solicited by\u000a      news media including The\u000a      Times Magazine. He was interviewed on Bhutan State TV on the significance\u000a      of China-India\u000a      relations for the Himalayan peoples; an interview that was picked up in\u000a      the country's newspapers.\u000a      The President of the Centre for Bhutan Studies highlights how one of\u000a      Anand's public lectures that\u000a      presented an alternative perspective on Bhutan-India relations has had a\u000a      significant impact: `Since\u000a      then, quite a few columnists has taken Dr Anand's stance and several\u000a      researches are underway\u000a      along the same line' (9). A lecture at Kashmir University in April 2013\u000a      was covered by major\u000a      Kashmir newspapers and picked up and criticized by an Indian newspaper\u000a      that established a\u000a      campaign against him (10). Elements of his Facebook commentary are\u000a      re-produced by the\u000a      Kashmiri separatist group online magazine Voice of Jammu Kashmir. Anand\u000a      has established an\u000a      online platform `Kashmir Writes and Kashmiri Rights' through which he\u000a      mentors young Kashmiri\u000a      writers. Already one has had pieces printed in Kashmiri newspapers.\u000a    Anand utilises the full range of pathways to impact. Based on the\u000a      international standing of\u000a      his research and his willingness and ability to engage across a variety of\u000a      formal and informal\u000a      mediums, he has had significant impact on public discourse and policy\u000a      developments on Tibet and\u000a      other aspects of minority-majority relations in the Himalayan region.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dibyesh Anand has effectively translated his international reputation as\u000a      a scholar on contemporary\u000a      politics and international relations of the Tibetan diaspora to impact on\u000a      public discourse and policy,\u000a      in particular on self-immolation; the false accusations against Karmapa\u000a      Lama; the India-China\u000a      border dispute; and, more broadly, minority-majority relations in the\u000a      Himalayan region.

The Department of Politics and International Relations has a\u000a      particular specialism in\u000a      the relationship and conflicts between majority-minority populations,\u000a      driven by competing\u000a      nationalisms and differing conceptions of territory and sovereignty. For\u000a      example, Dannreuther's\u000a      work has focused on the treatment of Muslim communities in Russia and\u000a      border conflicts over\u000a      energy resources in South Asia.\u000a    Anand's research integrates three inter-related themes from which his\u000a      impact on public\u000a      discourse and policy is drawn:\u000a    \u000a       The role of West in the international problem of Tibet\u000a       China's policies and practices to legitimise its control over\u000a        Tibetans\u000a       Tibet and the Dalai Lama as factors in India-China relations.\u000a    \u000a    Anand joined Westminster in 2007 and at the end of that year published Geopolitical\u000a        Exotica:\u000a        Tibet in Western Imagination with University of Minnesota Press (1).\u000a      The book was republished in\u000a      2009 in South Asia where the bulk of Tibetan exiles live as Tibet: A\u000a        Victim of Geopolitics. A revised\u000a      version was translated by the Party School of the Central Committee of the\u000a      Communist Party of\u000a      China in Beijing, but the approval for its publication was withheld by the\u000a      Chinese Government in\u000a      2010. A review by the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies (IPCS), a\u000a      major South Asia think-tank\u000a      described the book at `a masterful exposition of Tibet's place in\u000a      international relations using the\u000a      lens of postcolonialism'. This and later published essays (2, 3, 4)\u000a      provide postcolonial critique of\u000a      colonial practices that shaped Tibet as an international problem and\u000a      engages with the politics of\u000a      identity and representation in the Tibetan diaspora. Contrary to the\u000a      widely held myth of the West as\u000a      a benign and helpless observer as China occupies Tibet and converts\u000a      Tibetans from a distinct\u000a      ethnonational community into a minority, Anand argues that both Western\u000a      ideas and practices are\u000a      complicit in Chinese control of Tibet.\u000a    Current research by Anand shifts the focus to a critical analysis of\u000a      China's public diplomacy\u000a      and the conversion of Tibet into `China's Tibet'. In addition to fieldwork\u000a      through a travel grant from\u000a      the Universities China Committee of London (UCCL) in 2008, a British\u000a      Academy funded research\u000a      grant `China's Tibet: (Inter)National Politics of Imagination' took Anand\u000a      to Beijing, Lhasa and other\u000a      parts of China in 2010-11.\u000a    An emerged strand of research focuses on the cooperative and competitive\u000a      relations between\u000a      China and India with special reference to the border dispute and differing\u000a      attitudes toward Tibet (5).\u000a      It also engages with the significance of China-India relations for other\u000a      peoples and countries in the\u000a      Himalayan region, especially Bhutan and Kashmir. Part of this research was\u000a      funded by a British\u000a      Association for South Asian Studies Small Grant in 2008-09 and an article\u000a      in the Journal of\u000a        Defence Studies (6) is the first major output on this theme.

Baker is credited as being\u000d\u000a      responsible for initiating this approach, which is of great significance\u000d\u000a      as 80%-90% of all security and justice in Africa is delivered by non-state\u000d\u000a      actors. His research has been heavily used in the formulation and\u000d\u000a      evaluation of security and justice training, and support programmes across\u000d\u000a      the globe.\u000d\u000a    Beneficiaries of Baker's research have included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aInternational Organisations e.g. Organisation for Economic\u000d\u000a        Co-operation and Development\/Development Assistance Committee\u000d\u000a        (OECD\/DAC), and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\u000d\u000a      \u000aNational Governments or Agencies e.g. the President of Uganda,\u000d\u000a        Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO), US Department of Defence,\u000d\u000a        British Army (12th Mechanised Brigade), Australian Federal\u000d\u000a        Police, and the Dutch Foreign Ministry.\u000d\u000a      \u000aDonor Agencies e.g. United States Agency for International\u000d\u000a        Development (USAID), Department for International Development (DFID),\u000d\u000a        Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA).\u000d\u000a      \u000aNon-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) e.g. The Liaison Office\u000d\u000a        (Kabul).\u000d\u000a      \u000aThink Tanks e.g. Chatham House; Africa Center for Strategic\u000d\u000a        Studies (ACSS), Washington DC; Center for Complex Operations (CCO),\u000d\u000a        Washington DC; Center for Naval Analysis (CNA), Washington.\u000d\u000a      \u000aCommercial Security Consultancies e.g. Deloitte, Washington DC.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The evidence for impact of Baker's research takes a number of\u000d\u000a      forms. For example, key policy documents have referenced his research and\u000d\u000a      embraced the conclusions. In addition, governments and international\u000d\u000a      bodies have requested training seminars and presentations based on Baker's\u000a      research. Baker's services as a specialist consultant and advisor\u000d\u000a      on non-state policing, security and justice brings work from many parts of\u000d\u000a      the world and has extended the impact of the research far beyond Africa.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on public policy, law and services\u000d\u000a    Baker's research has brought the use of non-state actors in\u000d\u000a      providing security and justice onto policy agendas globally. It is now\u000d\u000a      recognised by governments and aid agencies as an essential component to\u000d\u000a      the implementation of security and justice programmes. Security and\u000d\u000a      justice interventions and programmes which are based on his research occur\u000d\u000a      across the world, particularly in the African countries.\u000d\u000a    Baker's work has been used by several international aid agencies,\u000d\u000a      and he is referred to in policy documents produced by the OECD and AUSAID.\u000d\u000a      For example, in a chapter entitled `Justice and Security as Public and\u000d\u000a      Private Goods and Services' in the 2009 report for the OECD's `Contracting\u000a        Out Government Functions and Services: Emerging Lessons from\u000d\u000a        Post-Conflict and Fragile Situations' Baker is cited nine\u000d\u000a      times [a]. The author of the report confirms that the report was largely\u000d\u000a      based on Baker's research and ideas [f]. This report is now used\u000d\u000a      around the world as the basis for security and justice interventions. It\u000d\u000a      links Baker directly to the programmes across the globe that are\u000d\u000a      currently in place for providing security and justice.\u000d\u000a    His unique contribution is also recognised in by the Global Consortium on\u000d\u000a      Security Transformation, in its Working Paper 6 on Crime Prevention\u000d\u000a        and Community in Africa [b]. The paper specifically states: \"We\u000d\u000a        owe to the more intrepid scholars such as Bruce Baker\u000d\u000a        some useful criminological studies of the aftermath of severe conflict\u000d\u000a        in a number of African countries, and some fruitful ideas on how\u000d\u000a        communities can be harnessed to the task of post-conflict crime\u000d\u000a        prevention, as discussed below. In recent years a handful of scholars\u000d\u000a        have begun to consider the ways in which principles such as community\u000d\u000a        policing tend to adapt to radically different social environments &#8212; as\u000d\u000a        in post-Cold War Africa. [...] the foremost, and certainly the most\u000d\u000a        prolific, academic commentator on this issue in recent years has been\u000d\u000a        Bruce Baker of Coventry University. The strength\u000d\u000a        of Baker's approach lies in his attempt to\u000d\u000a        investigate the issue across a number of states...\". Security and\u000d\u000a      justice interventions and programmes which are based on his research occur\u000d\u000a      across the world, particularly in the African countries of Nigeria,\u000d\u000a      Ethiopia, Congo, and South Sudan. For example, the OECD Security Sector\u000d\u000a      Reform Handbook, which is now used globally as a reference for security\u000d\u000a      and justice interventions, based its recommendations on the use of\u000d\u000a      non-state actors predominantly on Baker's work [c].\u000d\u000a    In a related area of research, Baker and Liebling (a Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer at Coventry throughout the period) published a report on policing\u000d\u000a      sexual violence in Northern Uganda. This was taken by Mary Robinson,\u000d\u000a      United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to President Museveni of\u000d\u000a      Uganda. Robinson later reported that she and Museveni discussed the\u000d\u000a      research findings. Robinson reported that Museveni had said that this was\u000d\u000a      very important and had not been mentioned to him before. He confirmed he\u000d\u000a      would act on it and debate the issues at the Security Council meeting in\u000d\u000a      Kampala in October 2010.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on practitioners and professional services\u000d\u000a    While Baker's research was based on fieldwork and experience on\u000d\u000a      the ground in Africa it has been translated into different contexts across\u000d\u000a      the globe. Baker's research has had an impact on setting the\u000d\u000a      agenda, changing discourse, and supporting implementation and training. As\u000d\u000a      a result of his work, organisations such as government departments and aid\u000d\u000a      agencies recognise the need for training and supporting non-state actors\u000d\u000a      in the delivery of security and justice [e].\u000d\u000a    Non-state policing is now recognised as important by the British\u000d\u000a      government and is incorporated into multiple programmes designed by DFID,\u000d\u000a      who are advised by Baker. For example, in 2011, a UK team designed\u000d\u000a      and implemented a programme in Sierra Leone, which sought to develop the\u000d\u000a      capacity of chieftain \"police\" and other community-based structures. In\u000d\u000a      the light of his published research, Baker has undertaken security\u000d\u000a      and justice programme design in Ethiopia and Kenya for the British\u000d\u000a      government's Stabilisation Unit (2011, 2012), and was appointed a senior\u000d\u000a      security and justice adviser for that Unit (2012). As an advisor, he\u000d\u000a      provides an alternative viewpoint to other experts from fields including\u000d\u000a      law and security.\u000d\u000a    Baker's research is heavily used in the formulation and evaluation\u000d\u000a      of international security and justice programmes. For example, in Papua\u000d\u000a      New Guinea the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Australian\u000d\u000a      Aid Programme successful implemented non-state security and justice\u000d\u000a      training, and installed nearly 900 female non-state judges.\u000d\u000a    Baker has worked with the Australian Federation Police (AFP) who\u000d\u000a      are in the process of producing a strategy and training programme on how\u000d\u000a      to carry out work in overseas territories. In 2011, he gave a public\u000d\u000a      presentation to approximately 200 members of the Federal Police, covering\u000d\u000a      all levels. The audience was able to identify with the examples from his\u000d\u000a      research that he provided. Further to this, Baker was heavily\u000d\u000a      involved in producing a thematic guide for the AFP which has been approved\u000d\u000a      and circulated to their 8,000 staff. This guide has raised awareness of\u000d\u000a      the issues which overseas police forces are facing and is being used as a\u000d\u000a      reference aid in practice. It is also being used by the AFP Overseas\u000d\u000a      Force, which at any one time consists of approximately 1,500 people. In\u000d\u000a      addition to the initial circulation, the guide had been downloaded from\u000d\u000a      the force's internal website over 600 times as of early 2013 [h].\u000d\u000a    Baker's research has underpinned the delivery of various training\u000d\u000a      programmes for international aid agencies, working in the security and\u000d\u000a      justice sector. These include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Dutch government &#8212; a presentation for 25 of its Senior Security\u000d\u000a        Advisers, 2008;\u000d\u000a      World Bank\/USIP &#8212; a workshop for 150 attendees, 2009;\u000d\u000a      Commercial Companies &#8212; a workshop for 12 London-based security\u000d\u000a        consultancies;\u000d\u000a      DFID &#8212; course for 25 Security Advisers\/Practitioners per group,\u000d\u000a        2009-ongoing;\u000d\u000a      Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office &#8212; workshop for 30 Ethiopian Security\u000d\u000a        Personnel, 2010;\u000d\u000a      Danish Foreign Ministry\/DANIDA &#8212; workshop for 200 attendees, 2010;\u000d\u000a      US Department for Defense &#8212; workshop for 50 US officials, military and\u000d\u000a        security analysts, 2010;\u000d\u000a      British Army &#8212; workshop for 150 Officers of the 12th Mechanised\u000d\u000a        Brigade, 2010.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The DFID workshop is delivered by Baker, and others, and has run\u000d\u000a      regularly since 2009. In each cohort, 50% of the participants are UK\u000d\u000a      government employees, from departments such as DIFD and MOD, and the other\u000d\u000a      50% are from organisations such as other EU member state governments,\u000d\u000a      development agencies and non-governmental organisations. There are\u000d\u000a      approximately 25 people per course, which runs five times per year. The\u000d\u000a      course influences the thinking of security and justice practitioners who\u000d\u000a      are based in the field.\u000d\u000a    Due to Baker's work, governments and donors are recognising\u000d\u000a      non-state actors as providers of security and justice [g,i]. This\u000d\u000a      awareness is leading to a change in practice in the way that projects are\u000d\u000a      implemented. For example, Baker was commissioned by the Africa\u000d\u000a      Center for Strategic Studies (ACSS), 2010, to write: Non-state\u000d\u000a        Policing: Expanding the Scope for Tackling Africa's Urban Violence\u000d\u000a      [d]. ACSS is the pre-eminent US Department of Defense institution for\u000d\u000a      strategic security studies\/research in Africa. It supports United States\u000d\u000a      foreign and security policies by strengthening the strategic capacity of\u000d\u000a      African states to identify and resolve security challenges. The\u000d\u000a      publication is cited inter alia by the Human Security Gateway. This led to\u000d\u000a      Baker being invited by the ACSS to participate in training for\u000d\u000a      senior government, justice and security officials from West Africa in 2013\u000d\u000a      and similar officials from North Africa and the Middle East in 2013.\u000d\u000a    Conclusion\u000d\u000a    Baker's research has had global impact in the way in which\u000d\u000a      governments, NGOs and other agencies view non-state policing, security and\u000d\u000a      justice actors which resulted in changes to policy, practice and the\u000d\u000a      training of practitioners. As such it has made a major contribution to\u000d\u000a      improving Human Security for millions of people in Africa and other\u000d\u000a      turbulent regions across the world.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study focuses on research into both state and non-state\u000d\u000a      policing and enhancement of the governance of justice and security in\u000d\u000a      Africa and beyond.

This\u000d\u000a      research by Baker was started in 2000 in South Africa [1]. The\u000d\u000a      research was subsequently extended to cover a number of other countries in\u000d\u000a      Africa including: Mozambique (2002, British Academy funded), Uganda\u000d\u000a      (2003-4, ESRC funded) [2], Sierra Leone (2004-5, ESRC funded; 2006,\u000d\u000a      British Academy funded), Rwanda (2006, ESRC funded), Liberia (2007, ESRC\u000d\u000a      funded) [3], South Sudan (2007, at request of DFID and USAID) and, since\u000d\u000a      2008, has covered Northern Uganda (2009, British Academy funded), Ethiopia\u000d\u000a      (2011, at request of HMG Stabilisation Unit) and Kenya (2012, at request\u000d\u000a      of HMG Stabilisation Unit).\u000d\u000a    Baker's research has revealed a wide diversity of local policing\u000d\u000a      providers that people in Africa look to for policing services and whom in\u000d\u000a      many contexts they have reason to prefer to the state police. His research\u000d\u000a      established that: many non-state policing actors were effective and had\u000d\u000a      popular support [4]; and that international policing reform programmes\u000d\u000a      were having only minimal impact on the effectiveness of the police in\u000d\u000a      providing everyday policing for the majority of their citizens [3].\u000d\u000a    On the basis of the empirical evidence, Baker has argued that\u000d\u000a      security and justice programmes in Africa must recognise the multiple\u000d\u000a      layering of service providers that form a continuum; only towards the\u000d\u000a      margins of the range can these be readily delineated as state or non-state\u000d\u000a      [4]. The policy implication of his research is that state and non-state\u000d\u000a      policing need to work collaboratively to maximise their effectiveness and\u000d\u000a      extend access to justice [5]. Baker has\u000d\u000a      therefore advocated a multi-layered approach. This identifies at least\u000d\u000a      three layers of security and justice providers below the state, namely:\u000d\u000a      commercial; non-governmental organisations; and local (informal)\u000d\u000a      providers. All are considered as potential providers and partners of\u000d\u000a      security and justice. Though acknowledging that integrating such diverse\u000d\u000a      actors will not be straightforward [6], Baker advocates a policy\u000d\u000a      of multi-layered support as the most appropriate developmental approach to\u000d\u000a      the delivery of justice and security services, particularly in the context\u000d\u000a      of weak states and limited police services.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23745","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Enabled by the key publications and funding listed above, &#214;zerdem's\u000d\u000a      research has produced\u000d\u000a      findings that have had significant impact at policy and programme level.\u000d\u000a      This impact has been\u000d\u000a      particularly strong for practitioners working in the fields of\u000d\u000a      peacebuilding, post-war reconstruction,\u000d\u000a      conflict resolution and diplomacy, and also for those working in aid and\u000d\u000a      development programmes.\u000d\u000a      The following three examples are illustrative of this impact.

The handbook\u000d\u000a      sets out their approach\u000d\u000a      to disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programmes, provides an\u000d\u000a      evidence-based\u000d\u000a      framework to underpin future programming work with ex-combatants and acts\u000d\u000a      as a training tool for\u000d\u000a      the organisation's staff. The IOM has more than 7,800 staff working in\u000d\u000a      over 470 locations. It is\u000d\u000a      currently running around 2,300 projects with an annual expenditure of USD\u000d\u000a      1.3 billion. Having\u000d\u000a      undertaken disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programmes\u000d\u000a      in over 20\u000d\u000a      countries, the IOM recognised the need to distil lessons learned and\u000d\u000a      provide a training tool for staff\u000d\u000a      involved in current and future programmes. They also wanted to identify\u000d\u000a      interconnections between\u000d\u000a      past and present missions, and those in different places.\u000d\u000a    Preparing the handbook involved undertaking an extensive evaluation of\u000d\u000a      the organisation's current\u000d\u000a      and previous DDR, programmes and interviewing senior level leaders within\u000d\u000a      IOM. &#214;zerdem used\u000d\u000a      his conceptualisation of `social reintegration' of former combatants and\u000d\u000a      child soldiers in drafting the\u000d\u000a      handbook. This concept is now being used by IOM field offices worldwide,\u000d\u000a      including in 25 of the 36\u000d\u000a      countries the World Bank identifies as `conflict-affected'. Marco Basso,\u000d\u000a      Chief of Mission for IOM\u000d\u000a      Afghanistan, identified the strengths of the handbook as:\u000d\u000a    \"Firstly it gives clear direction on how to plan and implement\u000d\u000a        DDR-focused projects, and it does so\u000d\u000a        in an easily-accessible way. Secondly, it has contributed significantly\u000d\u000a        towards the standardisation\u000d\u000a        of practice across IOM operations in the DDR field. Finally, and perhaps\u000d\u000a        most importantly, it\u000d\u000a        exemplifies based on IOM's previous experiences.\" [a]\u000d\u000a    &#214;zerdem also engaged in the IOM's project planning for the\u000d\u000a      Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration\u000d\u000a      Programme (APRP), which aims to reintegrate the Taliban into society.\u000d\u000a        &#214;zerdem's \"good practice\"\u000d\u000a      recommendations on identity transformation for former combatants and child\u000d\u000a      soldiers formed the\u000d\u000a      backbone of his advice to the APRP process. As part of his involvement, he\u000d\u000a      assisted the design of\u000d\u000a      a comprehensive reintegration strategy focused on income generation for\u000d\u000a      ex-combatants, which\u000d\u000a      involved key government agencies and the private sector.

Rather, it\u000d\u000a      signals the beginning of a long\u000d\u000a      and complex peacebuilding process, with one of the major risks to peace\u000d\u000a      being a failure to\u000d\u000a      successfully reform security provision in a way that is acceptable and\u000d\u000a      appropriate for all sides. The\u000d\u000a      cessation of hostilities inevitably produces a large number of demobilised\u000d\u000a      combatants, most of\u000d\u000a      them lacking any basic means of support or livelihood. The poor economic\u000d\u000a      conditions and political\u000d\u000a      instability of many war-torn societies means that failure to respond to\u000d\u000a      the reintegration needs of\u000d\u000a      former combatants, and bring about reform within the security sector in\u000d\u000a      general, can result in a\u000d\u000a      high level of insecurity [5]. This insecurity, driven by crime waves or\u000d\u000a      politically-motivated violence\u000d\u000a      from disenfranchised ex-combatants, threatens peace accords and can\u000d\u000a      provoke further armed\u000d\u000a      conflict.\u000d\u000a    By conducting comparative research into the four main aspects of\u000d\u000a      post-conflict reconstruction\u000d\u000a      (security, governance, socio-economic environment, and justice and\u000d\u000a      reconciliation) the research\u000d\u000a      has made a significant contribution to knowledge and has been particularly\u000d\u000a      beneficial to\u000d\u000a      peacebuilding practitioners.

The former has since been\u000a      taken forward in the context of Defra's Action Plan for the Environment,\u000a      while the latter directly resulted in the first analysis of the UK's\u000a      natural environment in terms of its benefits to society and economic\u000a      prosperity. This &#163;2 million initiative reported in 2011 and was recognized\u000a      by government as a vital step forward in developing integrated approaches\u000a      to environmental management. Its recommendations were taken forward in the\u000a      2011 Natural Environment White Paper including the setting up of a\u000a      research and practice network led by CRPR (Study 3). CRPR research\u000a      contributed directly to the National Assessment; Defra's Head of Science,\u000a      Land and Farming Directorate said the research made a `recognised\u000a      contribution to the development and implementation of ecosystems policy in\u000a      Defra', including because it `gave us the evidence to commit to conducting\u000a      the world's first National-level Ecosystem Assessment', hailed as a `gold\u000a      standard' by Europe.

The research led to the production of national guidelines\u000a      on the use participatory and deliberative techniques for embedding the\u000a      approach across government (Studies 1 and 2). This research resulted in\u000a      Defra's (2007) Ecosystem Action Plan incorporating the principle of\u000a      stakeholder engagement and dialogue into its revised approach (Defra\u000a      2010). Defra's Head of Science, Land and Farming Directorate commented\u000a      that this part of CRPR's research `provided a clear framework for how\u000a      decision makers at a range of spatial scales could incorporate the\u000a      non-monetary value of ecosystem services into their decisions through\u000a      participatory and deliberative processes.' He also noted that `the\u000a      Ecosystems Policy team in Defra passed on this guide to numerous policy\u000a      contacts within and outside the Department for them to consider how these\u000a      various techniques might be able to enhance their decisions.'1\u000a      This work was part of Defra's evidence base that has since informed\u000a      developments in HM Treasury Green Book guidance on the non-market\u000a      valuation of environmental impacts. The original consultation document\u000a      regarding these guidelines was downloaded by more than 300 stakeholders\u000a      and became the focus of a major seminar on enabling citizens' choices\u000a      about land use and the natural environment as part of a Department for\u000a      Business, Innovation and Skills sponsored science dialogue project by the\u000a      Natural Capital Initiative.\u000a    Improving policy on environmental stewardship in upland farming\u000a        through participation in a review of the English Uplands\u000a    The CRPR findings about the farming community's pivotal role in\u000a      environmental protection as part of the ecosystems services approach were\u000a      taken forward by an inquiry undertaken by the Commission for Rural\u000a      Communities into the English Uplands.2 This Inquiry provided\u000a      the major stimulus to the Government's review of uplands policy and the\u000a      launch of a new suite of policy initiatives and related funding in March\u000a      2011. The package included &#163;6million a year available to hill farmers for\u000a      environmental stewardship schemes in recognition of the contribution they\u000a      make to ecosystems across a range of services including carbon storage,\u000a      and the maintenance of recreational land and landscape. The then Chairman\u000a      of Commission for Rural Communities commented `The Inquiry research has\u000a      become a seminal report which is gradually being rolled out by HM\u000a      Government. This is due in large part to the huge impact of Professor\u000a      Winter's influence on the whole of the research and inquiry process'.3\u000a    Improving environmental farmland policy including better training for\u000a        farmers about agri-environmental schemes\u000a    Lobley and Winter's findings from the ESRC RELU Project (Study 6) that\u000a      more specific and specialised training and advice improves farmers'\u000a      expertise in and attitudes towards an ecosystems-oriented,\u000a      wildlife-friendly approach, were communicated to Defra and other\u000a      stakeholders from 2011. The independent ESRC\/NERC\/BBSRC reviewer of the\u000a      grant funding Study 6 noted in 2011 that `the highlight of this research\u000a      has been its impact on the design and implementation of agri-environmental\u000a      schemes. This has already been reflected in changes to the delivery of\u000a      Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) and will inform the design of a modified\u000a      agri-environment scheme that will operate from 2014 to 2020.' The reviewer\u000a      identified the research contributions as `extremely valuable evidence of\u000a      the positive impact of training on farmer attitudes and, crucially, on the\u000a      quality of the environmental management that they undertake.'\u000a    The findings were presented in a set of briefing meetings with senior\u000a      Defra and Natural England representatives, which resulted in the\u000a      introduction of fundamental environmental training as a component of the\u000a      ELS4.

The ecosystems\u000a      services approach is based on integrated management of land, water and\u000a      living resources to promote conservation and sustainable use in an\u000a      equitable way. From 2006, the CRPR analysed policy systems by using this\u000a      approach and the implications for the way rural communities interact with\u000a      policy. Researchers found that the approach implied a major change in\u000a      environmental policy and management. They undertook a series of projects\u000a      to gather the necessary scientific and social scientific knowledge to\u000a      assist policymakers in making this change. They also found that\u000a      consideration of ecosystem services in decision making requires the\u000a      application of novel techniques in public dialogue and stakeholder\u000a      engagement. In this context, effective communication of scientific\u000a      knowledge with affected rural communities is essential (Fish et al 2011;\u000a      Fish 2011). This research was developed further in research for, and\u000a      co-authorship of, the highly influential first ever National Ecosystem\u000a      Assessment (Winter and Fish). The work of Fish and Winter was also taken\u000a      forward with Defra to assess how an ecosystems services approach might be\u000a      deployed in key policy sectors and their systems for implementation (Fish\u000a      et al 2011; Fish, Lobely and Winter 2013). Fish has co-authored several\u000a      papers, most recently in 2011,that have helped formulate Defra's action\u000a      plan for including an ecosystems services approach in its policymaking and\u000a      delivery of services (Fish et al 2011; Fish 2011). In addition, Winter\u000a      deployed his research work on ecosystem services by participating in a\u000a      national inquiry for the Prime Minister on the future of the English\u000a      uplands which he vice-chaired.\u000a    Researchers in CRPR applied the ecosystems services perspective to\u000a      national sustainable land policy and management by farmers. Between 2006\u000a      and 2009, Fish and Winter co-led an ESRC funded Rural Economy and Land Use\u000a      Programme (RELU) project, Sustainable and Holistic Food Chains for\u000a        Recycling Livestock Waste to Land, which led to a publication on the\u000a      rescaling of policy approaches to resource management at the farm level\u000a      (Winter et al 2010). This approach was further developed between 2006 and\u000a      2011 in a project on agri-environmental management, Improving the\u000a        Success of Agri-Environment Initiatives: The Role of Farmer Learning and\u000a        Landscape Context. This ESRC (RELU) project analysed\u000a      agri-environment schemes to encourage farmers to use pro-environmental\u000a      management practices to increase wildlife. However, in part due to\u000a      farmers' poor understanding of the aims of and science behind the schemes,\u000a      the policies often failed. Lobley and Winter's work (Lobley et al 2013),\u000a      communicated to policymakers from 2011, demonstrated the participatory\u000a      forms of communication with the communities affected that are the most\u000a      effective and identified specialised training as a way of improving\u000a      farmers' expertise and attitudes towards a wildlife-friendly approach.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23845","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Improving electoral administration in recording official voting data:\u000d      Vowles and Karp's finding of errors in the 2008 election recording of\u000d      special votes in polling places revealed that many `special voters' had\u000d      not been recorded on the master rolls as having voted. Misclassification\u000d      in the 2008 dataset was as much as 40 per cent. The problem was\u000d      subsequently also identified in data from the 2002 and 2005 elections, and\u000d      was discussed and documented (Vowles 2010). The findings were communicated\u000d      to the New Zealand Electoral Commission, which is responsible for the\u000d      administration of national elections, in 2009, along with the implications\u000d      of the problem. Recording of special voters for public inspection is a\u000d      legal requirement and could be needed if an electoral petition challenging\u000d      the result were to be initiated. As a result of Vowles and Karp's\u000d      findings, the Commission `reviewed the clarity of [its] instructions in\u000d      producing the master rolls' to Returning Officers in the 23 Electoral\u000d      Offices across the whole country and `put greater emphasis on this area\u000d      when training Returning Officers' (Chief Electoral Officer, personal\u000d      communication, 2009).1 Following up his earlier research,\u000d      Vowles monitored the effectiveness of the changes in the 2011 NZES. He\u000d      found a reduction in the problem although not its complete elimination,\u000d      with 4 per cent of those validated as non-voters claiming they had cast a\u000d      special vote. The Electoral Commission has now further responded by\u000d      increasing automation in the process for scrutinising the master rolls in\u000d      time for the 2014 election which should further improve administration.\u000d    Better understanding of voter attitudes for more effective electoral\u000d        administration:\u000d      The research findings about public understanding of NZ elections (Miller\u000d      and Vowles 2009; Vowles 2011) helped the Electoral Commission decide on\u000d      appropriate administrative services for elections. Vowles is part of a\u000d      group assisting the Electoral Commission in improving its strategy,\u000d      including leading a workshop in August 2013, to inform their policy for\u000d      the 2014 NZ election. The importance of the research to this beneficiary\u000d      is reflected in the part-funding of NZES by the New Zealand Electoral\u000d      Commission since 2005. The 2008 and 2011 NZES contained several questions\u000d      developed jointly with the Electoral Commission. Findings about the 2011\u000d      election were communicated to the Commission in March and April 2012 with\u000d      research helping the Commission assess the potential to introduce voting\u000d      using the internet. Vowles reported findings that most people still prefer\u000d      personal voting (46%) although 36% would prefer the internet to the\u000d      Commission. This supports the Electoral Commission's policy of not\u000d      introducing a wholesale change immediately but to move forward with a\u000d      trial of online voting scheduled for elections in 2016.\u000d    Improvements to Electoral Commission information campaigns and\u000d        informing media debate during the mixed member proportional system\u000d        national referendum:\u000d      The research findings that there were misconceptions about MMP in public\u000d      attitudes (Vowles 2010; 2011) helped the Electoral Commission's education\u000d      strategy for public understanding in the November 2011 MMP referendum. The\u000d      educational materials were effective with 88% of those who received\u000d      Commission information feeling confident in their ability to make a\u000d      meaningful vote, and, amongst all voters, 82% of registered electors\u000d      knowing that the question would be whether they wanted to keep MMP or not\u000d      (compared to only 35% in May 2011 before the campaign).2 Vowles\u000d      communicated with campaigners and media organisations prior to the\u000d      referendum. In the national press, Vowles' (2011) research about MMP's\u000d      effects on the accountability of representatives was used in media\u000d      stories, including the largest circulation newspaper, the New Zealand\u000d      Herald. On 16 Nov 2011 the paper reported the `quality analysis being\u000d      contributed to the debate' by the research and how `Prof Jack Vowles\u000d      nicely demolishes the anti-MMP argument about the supposed lack of\u000d      accountability under the current system.' (http:\/\/bit.ly\/ve6D9p).\u000d      Rudman, an influential national columnist, wrote about the referendum\u000d      campaign in the New Zealand Herald (Dec 14th 2011) (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1dxKQIw)\u000d      after it had been completed. He cited Vowles' finding that `the survival\u000d      of electorate-defeated MPs through dual candidacy is relatively rare' as\u000d      important in Rudman's own support for the retention of MMP during the\u000d      campaign. The media debate contributed to high public knowledge about the\u000d      referendum which was further promoted by the researchers making NZES\u000d      datasets available to all campaigners, with some using it to target their\u000d      campaigns (Gray and Fitzsimmons 2012).3 The high level of\u000d      knowledge was confirmed by data from the NZES showing that 9 out of 10\u000d      people were aware of the referendum.\u000d    Vowles and Karp's research helped confirm the legitimacy of the 2011\u000d      referendum outcome by showing that voters made an informed choice in\u000d      retaining MMP in evidence to the Justice and Electoral Law Committee\u000d      select committee.4 Karp's analysis confirmed that the public\u000d      did have a preference for MMP as expressed in the referendum result\u000d      undercutting criticism and reinforcing the legitimacy of the referendum\u000d      result. (http:\/\/www.parliament.nz\/resource\/0000190224).\u000a      Vowles extended his research on voter turnout, which had previously been\u000d      used by the Electoral Commission2, to show that MMP had not\u000d      reduced turnout in elections as some critics of it had claimed (http:\/\/www.parliament.nz\/resource\/0000190244).\u000a      A summary of findings appeared on the parliamentary website and triggered\u000d      media debate. In the New Zealand Herald (29 May 2012), Vowles research was\u000d      seen to challenge the media tendency of `turning elections into a two\u000d      horse presidential style contest' because `this ignores the MMP reality\u000d      that an election can be very close even though the gap between the two\u000d      main parties is wide' (http:\/\/bit.ly\/K6HaBL).\u000a      Parliament Today (28 May 2012) also ran an article reporting the research,\u000d      quoting it substantially.5\u000d    Informing a national review of the mixed member proportional system\u000d        including to maintain thresholds on party electoral support necessary\u000d        for admission to Parliament:\u000d      The research findings about public attitudes to MMP were used by a major\u000d      review of MMP to the Ministry of Justice in 2012 and affected the review's\u000d      recommendations. The research found that nearly half of New Zealanders\u000d      believed that too many parties were represented in the New Zealand\u000d      Parliament, including a third of people who voted for MMP in the 2011\u000d      referendum. Vowles submitted these findings as evidence to the MMP Review\u000d      in May 2012 (http:\/\/www.mmpreview.org.nz\/search\/apachesolr_search\/NZES)\u000d      MMP potentially contributes to more parties being represented in\u000d      Parliament depending on the threshold of the vote that parties have to\u000d      achieve to obtain representation. The information about the potential\u000d      threat to the legitimacy of MMP provided grounds for the Review Panel to\u000d      resist arguments that the overall threshold, currently winning at least\u000d      one electorate seat or 5% of all party votes, should be lowered\u000d      significantly or abolished, which would have increased the number of\u000d      parties in Parliament.

The research is grounded in two\u000d      fundamental principles of democracy: that elections maintain governmental\u000d      accountability and that elections serve to translate citizen preferences\u000d      into public policy. Vowles and Karp's research assessed under which\u000d      electoral rules and conditions these two principles are best conducted.\u000d    New Zealand is an important case of international interest because it\u000d      made a transition from a first past the post, single member plurality,\u000d      electoral system to a mixed member proportional (MMP) voting system in\u000d      1996. Under the MMP system, two types of representatives are elected: one\u000d      from electorates and the other from party lists, making it a moderate form\u000d      of proportional representation. A person may be both a candidate for an\u000d      electorate and on a party list. Evidence about experience with this system\u000d      is important to debates both in countries where first past the post\u000d      systems have been criticised and for new democracies looking for important\u000d      examples of electoral systems to learn from internationally. In New\u000d      Zealand itself, a major referendum on whether or not New Zealand should\u000d      retain the MMP system was held in 2011 (with 59 per cent supporting\u000d      retention of MMP in a 74 per cent turnout). In this context, research on\u000d      the operation of MMP has been important for policymakers, electoral\u000d      campaigners and the public.\u000d    Vowles and Karp participated in six funded studies investigating\u000d      electoral systems in New Zealand between 2008 and 2012 (see research\u000d      grants). Vowles was part of a major US National Science Foundation funded\u000d      project, Electoral Systems and Party Personnel: the Consequences of Reform\u000d      and Non-Reform (2008-12). This international study examined how electoral\u000d      systems affect `party personnel strategies' through an analysis of four\u000d      countries with electoral system change (New Zealand, Bolivia, Germany,\u000d      Portugal), and four without, as `steady-state' cases, (United Kingdom,\u000d      Ukraine, Lithuania, Japan). Karp investigated voters and coalition\u000d      government through the British Academy (2008-9) and voter validation in\u000d      New Zealand through Nuffield Foundation (2009-2010) funding. Research from\u000d      two funded studies (New Zealand Electoral Commission and Treasury 2008-9\u000d      and McDougall Trust 2011-12) was conducted as part of the New Zealand\u000d      Election Study (NZES) which has provided extensive data to help evaluate,\u000d      improve and sustain the quality of electoral democracy.\u000d    Findings from these studies were broadly supportive of the retention of\u000d      the MMP system but identified significant problems in the administrative\u000d      arrangements for national elections. The research found reasonably\u000d      informed citizen participation (Vowles 2010) and that perceptions of\u000d      fairness of MMP were a key correlate of support for the new system (Vowles\u000d      2008) and (Karp 2009). However, based on their analysis of NZES data, the\u000d      research (Vowles 2010) found that the administrative procedures for\u000d      recording special votes, where people vote at a polling place outside of\u000d      their electorate\/constituency, were insufficiently robust at the 2008\u000d      general election. Comparison with the official summary data showed many\u000d      `special voters' had not been recorded on the master rolls as having\u000d      voted. As a consequence, the Electoral Commission has decided to move\u000d      toward more centralisation and computerisation of the systems to improve\u000d      the quality of the electoral administration of special voters in future\u000d      elections.\u000d    The research found generally positive public attitudes towards MMP but\u000d      limitations in levels of understanding of the system. The US NSF funded\u000d      research found that dual candidacy in MMP is not a serious limitation on\u000d      candidate accountability. Relatedly, some voters prefer the coalitions\u000d      that are more common under MMP with preferences for coalition government\u000d      increasing from 46 per cent in 1999 to 56 per cent in 2010 (Miller and\u000d      Vowles 2009; Bowler, Karp and Donovan 2010; Vowles 2011). The findings\u000d      suggested that improved voter education about the system would lend\u000d      further support to MMP as a system combined with maintaining features of\u000d      the system which mitigate some of the public's concerns, especially that\u000d      it could potentially lead to a large number of small parties being\u000d      represented in New Zealand's Parliament. These findings have led to\u000d      follow-up research on their implications by Karp and Vowles through\u000d      interaction with the Electoral Commission and in evidence to the Review of\u000d      the MMP to the NZ Minister of Justice, with impacts on the form of MMP\u000d      retained in New Zealand (see section 4, details of impact).\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23975","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Raab's research has contributed to a more robust regulatory framework for\u000a      information privacy through informing (1) public debate and (2) regulatory\u000a      practice.\u000a    (1) Raab's insights have informed political debate on the social risks of\u000a      surveillance and data-sharing. His contribution to two high profile\u000a      reports ensured his insights directly shaped political discussion. The\u000a      first of these was A Report on the Surveillance Society (2006),\u000a      which Raab and colleagues in the Surveillance Studies Network were invited\u000a      to produce by the UK Information Commissioner. Raab authored prominent\u000a      sections on the social effects of public-sector surveillance, and the\u000a      different options for regulation. The report attracted worldwide media and\u000a      practitioner attention, triggering a number of impacts from 2008 onwards.\u000a      It brought into international currency discussion of the `surveillance\u000a      society' and how it could be controlled. For example, the European Data\u000a      Protection Supervisor made the report his main point of reference in a\u000a      December 2008 article setting out data protection trends and implications\u000a      for the EU (See 5.1 below). The report also triggered the launch of\u000a      investigations in both the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee\u000a      and the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution (2007-9). The\u000a      then Information Commissioner testifies that this unprecedented level of\u000a      parliamentary attention would not have happened `without the report\u000a      produced by Charles [Raab] and his colleagues' (5.2).\u000a    Raab played a central role in drafting a second influential report: the\u000a      House of Lords' Constitution Committee report Surveillance: Citizens\u000a        and the State (HL Paper 18, Session 2008-09) (5.3). Appointed\u000a      Specialist Adviser to the Lords' inquiry in 2007, he was able to shape the\u000a      Committee's investigation, including evidence-taking and witness\u000a      interrogation. He drafted large portions of the report, including on the\u000a      effects of surveillance on privacy and broader values; the importance of\u000a      raising public awareness and utilising PIAs; and the need for a variety of\u000a      regulatory instruments. The report garnered extensive media attention,\u000a      including articles in the Daily Mail, Guardian, Observer\u000a      and BBC Online.\u000a    Both reports helped civil-society bodies to draw attention to worrying\u000a      developments, and Raab contributed directly to this process. He was\u000a      academic mentor for Liberty's influential report, Overlooked:\u000a        Surveillance and Personal Privacy in Modern Britain. Published in\u000a      2007, the report went on to shape Liberty's campaigning on surveillance\u000a      issues throughout the REF period. The Director of Liberty notes that it\u000a      was a `seminal piece for Liberty's policy thinking', and `we continue to\u000a      draw on it for policy' (interview November 2012) (5.4). Raab also steered\u000a      Demos' report Private Lives: A People's Inquiry into Personal\u000a        Information (2010) and co-authored a report for the Equality and\u000a      Human Rights Commission, Protecting Information Privacy (2011).\u000a    (2) Raab's research has also had a more direct impact on the regulation\u000a      of information privacy, informing specific policies and frameworks in the\u000a      UK and beyond.\u000a    In 2009-10, Raab was invited to contribute to the Scottish Government's Identity\u000a        Management and Privacy Principles (2010) (5.5). His distinct\u000a      contribution is evident in principles that warn against discrimination and\u000a      social exclusion in identification processes; that encourage organisations\u000a      to raise awareness of privacy issues; and that promote transparency. These\u000a      principles have been widely cited and applied in Scottish Government\u000a      policy. For example, they are cited as relevant background to the Scottish\u000a      Government's Joined-up Data for Better Decisions: Guiding Principles\u000a        for Data Linkage (2012), which covers statistical and health\u000a      research, and in Scotland's Digital Future: Delivery of Public\u000a        Services (2012), where they help to underpin privacy assurance in\u000a      the strategy for digital public services and ICT that is being developed\u000a      across the Scottish public sector (see 5.5).\u000a    Raab has also influenced the use of Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) in\u000a      the UK. In 2012, Raab (with four colleagues) was commissioned by the\u000a      Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to review the practice of PIA. The\u000a      report and its recommendations have shaped the ICO's subsequent guidance\u000a      and advisory work on PIA, including its plans to work with business and\u000a      public sector organisations to build public trust in their data management\u000a      practices, and to promote the code at European level (see 5.6).\u000a    More specifically, Raab's insights on PIAs influenced the Scottish\u000a      Government's 2010 application of PIAs to its eCare data-sharing programme\u000a      for social care involving children. According to the Head of eCare Design\u000a      Authority, a feasibility study commissioned from Raab and a small team of\u000a      experts in 2004 `was taken on board...influencing and giving us the notion\u000a      of PIA as a tool and a means of working with stakeholders' (interview,\u000a      October 2012) (5.7).\u000a    The influence of Raab's work on regulation reaches beyond the UK. For\u000a      example, in Canada the Office of the Saskatchewan Information and Privacy\u000a      Commissioner's Annual Report for 2010-11 drew on Bennett and Raab's 2006\u000a      book (5.8), and in Australia the Deputy Privacy Commissioner for Victoria\u000a      adopted the same book's analytical construction concerning regulatory\u000a      roles for his paper at the 2008 Australian Institute of Administrative Law\u000a      Forum (5.9).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Raab (1998-2013) on data protection, privacy and surveillance\u000a      has influenced political debate and regulatory practice.

Following retirement\u000a      in December 2007, he retained a close working relationship with the\u000a      University as Professor Emeritus and Honorary Professorial Fellow, and was\u000a      then re-employed by the University in February 2012 to work as\u000a      Co-Investigator on two new EC Framework Programme projects on privacy and\u000a      surveillance.\u000a    Developments in information technology mean that we are now more\u000a      vulnerable than ever to unwanted surveillance. There is a growing demand\u000a      for personal information from both the public and private sectors; and new\u000a      information systems allow organisations to store, analyse and share such\u000a      information in increasingly complex ways. Academic research has focused\u000a      mainly on legal, technical and ethical aspects of these developments, and\u000a      has tended to conceive of privacy intrusions solely in terms of harms to\u000a      individuals and their rights. Raab and his co-author Colin Bennett\u000a      pioneered the systematic investigation of the theory, actors and\u000a      instruments involved in the regulation of privacy by analysing the full\u000a      range of institutions, roles, processes and tools involved in data\u000a      protection and in safeguarding the right of information privacy (e.g. Raab\u000a      1997; Raab and Bennett 1998; Bennett and Raab 2006).\u000a    Raab made the case for a more holistic view of the impacts of\u000a      surveillance beyond its effects on individual privacy, arguing that lack\u000a      of privacy protection has a potentially corrosive impact on society as a\u000a      whole (Bennett and Raab 2006; Raab 2012). He embraced the individual human\u000a      rights perspective but broadened the canvas to include a variety of social\u000a      effects of many surveillance and data-sharing practices, such as the\u000a      discrimination and social exclusion that can result from `social sorting'\u000a      and the reversal of the presumption of innocence. This involved rethinking\u000a      and expanding data protection from a technical and legal issue concerning\u000a      individual rights to recognising it as a form of social policy. As such,\u000a      data protection necessarily involves evaluation and judgement, rather than\u000a      the straightforward application of a set of laws.\u000a    Raab applied this approach to analyse the practice of privacy impact\u000a      assessment (PIA), a risk-based analytical process that was becoming\u000a      recognised as a key instrument for information privacy in many countries\u000a      (Bennett and Raab 2006; Raab 2007). He argued that PIA should be expanded\u000a      to involve wider societal values, thus taking into account the broader\u000a      effects of invasive surveillance and information systems across different\u000a      social groups and categories who may experience disadvantage and\u000a      unwarranted suspicion through the use of surveillance and\u000a      information-gathering.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23976","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Jeffery and McEwen's research has (1) informed the discourse and\u000d\u000a      strategies of political elites on both sides of the constitutional debate,\u000d\u000a      and (2) strongly shaped the Commission on Scottish Devolution (Calman\u000d\u000a      Commission) and the resulting provisions on fiscal autonomy in the 2012\u000d\u000a      Scotland Act.\u000d\u000a    (1) McEwen's research initially shaped the thinking of the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government's Constitutional Affairs Minister during the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government's National Conversation on Scotland's constitutional future\u000d\u000a      (2007-2009). The Minister had previously reviewed McEwen's 2006 book for\u000d\u000a      the Sunday Herald in May 2006 and was influenced by the comparisons with\u000d\u000a      Quebec. McEwen's research ideas were conveyed in a private meeting of\u000d\u000a      selected academics convened by the Constitutional Affairs Minister in 2008\u000d\u000a      and 2009. The SNP subsequently invited McEwen to present at an `away day'\u000d\u000a      of advisers in Autumn 2011. The Minister testifies to the importance of\u000d\u000a      these meetings and McEwen's research in general to the Government's\u000d\u000a      thinking on Scotland's welfare policy and its relationship with the rest\u000d\u000a      of the UK after independence. He writes: `Academic research, including\u000d\u000a      McEwen's work on Scotland and Quebec, informed our deliberations within\u000d\u000a      government when I was Minister with responsibility for the\u000d\u000a      Constitution...I took note in particular of the insights from the Quebec\u000d\u000a      referendum experience and the issues of welfare and social policy she\u000d\u000a      examined. This helped to inform our thinking on the continuation of a\u000d\u000a      social union after Scottish independence' (5.1).\u000d\u000a    On the other side of the constitutional debate, Jeffery's research on\u000d\u000a      social citizenship influenced senior members of the Labour Party who used\u000d\u000a      it to justify a further-reaching form of devolution, rather than full\u000d\u000a      independence for Scotland. In Summer and Autumn 2007, Jeffery had several\u000d\u000a      meetings with the Scottish Labour leader, and with the Director General\u000d\u000a      for Devolution within the UK Government (5.2). In these meetings they\u000d\u000a      discussed Jeffery's ideas on social citizenship as a frame for thinking\u000d\u000a      about political community on a UK-wide level. The Scottish Labour leader\u000d\u000a      drew on these ideas in a major speech on St Andrew's Day, 30 November\u000d\u000a      2007, which `pre- announced' what then became the (Calman) Commission on\u000d\u000a      Scottish Devolution in April 2008 (5.3). While the speech itself was\u000d\u000a      delivered shortly before the REF reporting period, it set out the\u000d\u000a      rationale and remit for the subsequent Commission. In the speech, the\u000d\u000a      Labour leader called for a remit which would emphasise the need for\u000d\u000a      greater fiscal autonomy for the Scottish Parliament in order to bring\u000d\u000a      greater accountability to devolved decision-making, while at the same time\u000d\u000a      securing continued access of Scots to the welfare state, referring to this\u000d\u000a      as `our social citizenship'.\u000d\u000a    (2) Jeffery's work on social citizenship not only helped shape Labour\u000d\u000a      thinking on the remit of the Calman Commission; it went on to influence\u000d\u000a      the multi-party Commission after it was set up in April 2008. The then\u000d\u000a      Director General for Devolution, with whom Jeffery had previously shared\u000d\u000a      his ideas about the importance of citizenship rights and the social union\u000d\u000a      (see above), became Secretary of the Calman Commission with responsibility\u000d\u000a      for drafting its reports (5.2). Jeffery was invited to brief the\u000d\u000a      Commission at a private meeting held in May 2008, before it took wider\u000d\u000a      evidence, in which he outlined how devolution impacted on social\u000d\u000a      citizenship rights.\u000d\u000a    Jeffery's ideas on social citizenship and the `social union' were\u000d\u000a      deployed in the Commission's reports. Ideas of the `social union' were\u000d\u000a      used to defend the retention at UK government level of powers over social\u000d\u000a      security and redistributive taxation, `because it is an aspect of the\u000d\u000a      social union to which Scotland belongs' (Calman, 2009: 8) (5.4). His work\u000d\u000a      informed the Commission's view that `there are social rights which should\u000d\u000a      also be substantially the same, even when it is best that they are\u000d\u000a      separately run in Scotland' (Calman, 2009: 6) (5.4). These arguments about\u000d\u000a      the social union were reiterated in the White Paper on a new Scotland Bill\u000d\u000a      (Scotland Office 2009: 4) (5.5), which was the UK Government's response to\u000d\u000a      the Calman Report, and which became the basis of the 2012 Scotland Act.\u000d\u000a    Jeffery's research also influenced the Calman Report's recommendations on\u000d\u000a      finance. A key part of the Commission's remit was to recommend mechanisms\u000d\u000a      to strengthen the Scottish Parliament's financial accountability. In 2008,\u000d\u000a      Jeffery was appointed to the Independent Expert Group on Finance\u000d\u000a      established to advise the Calman Commission on these questions. As the\u000d\u000a      only political scientist in a group composed mainly of economists, Jeffery\u000d\u000a      was central to ensuring the Commission's discussion of territorial finance\u000d\u000a      was placed within a political and constitutional context. The Secretary of\u000d\u000a      the Calman Commission confirmed that Jeffery's contribution persuaded the\u000d\u000a      Commission that finance is not solely a technical matter but profoundly\u000d\u000a      political, and therefore required the Commission to address issues of the\u000d\u000a      balance of statewide equity vs. devolved autonomy\/accountability as well\u000d\u000a      as questions of economic efficiency. He noted that `work at Edinburgh was\u000d\u000a      critical' in `the contribution of the key idea that financial systems\u000d\u000a      serve constitutional ends' (5.2). Jeffery's ideas on the relationship\u000d\u000a      between equity and autonomy were adopted as two of the `basic principles'\u000d\u000a      to inform `considerations for funding sub-national governments' and\u000d\u000a      subsequent `constitutional design' (Independent Expert Group, 2008: 7-9;\u000d\u000a      10) (5.6) adopted by the Calman Commission in its interim (Calman\u000d\u000a      Commission 2008: 62-4; 68) (5.3) and final (Calman Commission, 2009: 66,\u000d\u000a      76, 89) (5.4) reports. These principles were in turn taken forward into\u000d\u000a      the UK Government's White Paper (Scotland Office 2009: 3-4; 8-9) (5.5) and\u000d\u000a      underlay the new provisions on fiscal autonomy in the 2012 Scotland Act\u000d\u000a      which, from 2015, will increase the proportion of Scottish Parliament\u000d\u000a      spending covered by tax decisions accountable to Scottish voters from\u000d\u000a      around 14% to around 35%.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Jeffery and McEwen on the relationship between nationalism\u000d\u000a      and the welfare state has had two main impacts on the debate over\u000d\u000a      Scotland's constitutional future. Firstly, the research has influenced the\u000d\u000a      discourse and strategies of political elites in both the Scottish National\u000d\u000a      Party and the Labour Party. Both have drawn on the research to mobilise\u000d\u000a      support through invoking ideas about the relationship between `social\u000d\u000a      citizenship,' `social union' and the welfare state, and its implications\u000d\u000a      for Scottish devolution or independence.

Her work shows how welfare states can\u000d\u000a      strengthen attachment to the nation-state as a political community,\u000d\u000a      thereby containing demands for regional autonomy and independence, and,\u000d\u000a      conversely, how demands for regional self-government can be fuelled by\u000d\u000a      welfare state retrenchment which undermines the state's role as the\u000d\u000a      guarantor of welfare across the state as a whole. This research has thus\u000d\u000a      shown how welfare policy can become a terrain that is contested between\u000d\u000a      statewide and non-statewide political parties in decentralised and federal\u000d\u000a      states, with each seeking support to pursue welfare goals at different\u000d\u000a      scales of political community. Her comparative work on Scotland\/the UK and\u000d\u000a      Qu&#233;bec\/Canada (2006) suggested that concepts such as that of `social\u000d\u000a      union', which is prominent in Canadian political discourse, can be invoked\u000d\u000a      to justify competing forms of `welfare nationalism': either a continued\u000d\u000a      understanding of political community at the level of the UK, or to\u000d\u000a      establish a rival or successor understanding of political community in\u000d\u000a      Scotland.\u000d\u000a    Jeffery entered this field in the mid-2000s, building directly on\u000d\u000a      McEwen's work to explore similar issues of welfare and political\u000d\u000a      community. His work drew on T.H. Marshall's concept of social citizenship,\u000d\u000a      as well as research he directed on public attitudes and devolution as part\u000d\u000a      of the ESRC Devolution Programme. For Marshall, `social citizenship'\u000d\u000a      referred to the minimal set of shared rights and entitlements to public\u000d\u000a      service provision, including health care, social security, affordable\u000d\u000a      housing and education, reflecting shared citizenship status. Jeffery\u000d\u000a      showed how the transfer of many of these policy fields through devolution\u000d\u000a      had led to a fragmentation of social citizenship rights across UK and\u000d\u000a      devolved administrations. He also highlighted seemingly contradictory\u000d\u000a      public preferences, including among Scots, for UK-wide shared social\u000d\u000a      rights alongside strong support for devolved administrations making their\u000d\u000a      own (inevitably divergent) policy decisions (Jeffery 2006, 2009). Echoing\u000d\u000a      McEwen's work, Jeffery viewed these paradoxical preferences regarding\u000d\u000a      welfare and social rights as implying a tension between allegiances at\u000d\u000a      different scales of political community. He argued that a key part of\u000d\u000a      reconciling these tensions would need to involve territorial financial\u000d\u000a      arrangements that balanced measures to ensure some level of statewide\u000d\u000a      equity in policy outcomes with others that gave devolved governments\u000d\u000a      sufficient fiscal autonomy to engage in the accountable, devolved-level\u000d\u000a      decision-making their citizens expected (Jeffery 2011).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23977","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A comprehensive impact strategy was built into the FoES project from the\u000d\u000a      outset. IPPR's involvement in the project was central to implementation of\u000d\u000a      this strategy: IPPR helped ensure publicity for the findings of the\u000d\u000a      successive waves of research, and also brokered discussions with senior\u000d\u000a      Labour party figures. The strategy has enabled the research to have three\u000d\u000a      substantial non-academic impacts.\u000d\u000a    First, the research stimulated widespread public debate on the status of\u000d\u000a      England within the United Kingdom. Publication of the two FoES reports (in\u000d\u000a      January 2012 and July 2013) prompted widespread media comment and debate,\u000d\u000a      including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      well over 100 newspaper reports on the findings (including stories in\u000d\u000a        all the main London quality newspapers), and Leader articles in many\u000d\u000a        London and Scottish-based newspapers;\u000d\u000a      features on major broadcast news shows (including Radio 4's Today\u000d\u000a        programme) and on the BBC News website (see 5.1 below);\u000d\u000a      op-ed pieces written by research team members around publication of\u000d\u000a        the FoES II report, published in the Daily Telegraph, Scotsman,\u000d\u000a        Western Mail, and on the Conservative Home and New\u000d\u000a          Statesman blogs;\u000d\u000a      Analysis by leading political commentators (including Bagehot in The\u000a          Economist(5.2), Andrew Rawnsley in The Observer(5.3),\u000d\u000a        Jackie Ashley and Martin Kettle in The Guardian, Philip Johnston\u000d\u000a        in the Daily Telegraph, Dominic Sandbrook in the Daily Mail,\u000d\u000a        and Brian Taylor of BBC Scotland) of the implications of the research\u000d\u000a        for England's status within the UK and\/or the potentially destabilising\u000d\u000a        effects for Britain of English dissatisfaction with current governing\u000d\u000a        arrangements.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The wider influence of FoES on political debate is shown by, inter\u000d\u000a        alia, references to the research made in Alex Salmond's January 2012\u000d\u000a      Hugo Young Lecture; references in the November 2012 report of the\u000d\u000a      Commission on Improving Devolution in Wales; numerous discussions of the\u000d\u000a      research on highly influential blogs (see examples 5.4 and 5.5); and the\u000d\u000a      invitation extended to the research team to present findings at the 2013\u000d\u000a      Hay Literary Festival.\u000d\u000a    Second, the research directly influenced the Final Report of the McKay\u000d\u000a      Commission (the Commission on the Consequences of Devolution for the House\u000d\u000a      of Commons) (5.6) to which Jeffery was appointed in recognition of his\u000d\u000a      expertise on territorial politics. FoES II included several questions\u000d\u000a      requested by the Commission. The Commission used (then unpublished) FoES\u000d\u000a      II findings in its March 2013 Final Report, citing FoES heavily (see McKay\u000d\u000a      2013: pp14-20) (5.6) as providing `compelling evidence that there are\u000d\u000a      distinct concerns, felt across England, that lack sufficient opportunity\u000d\u000a      to be expressed through current institutional arrangements' (p.21). This\u000d\u000a      understanding of public attitudes, in turn, underpinned the Commission's\u000d\u000a      central recommendation that `decisions at the United Kingdom level with a\u000d\u000a      separate and distinct effect for England...should normally be taken only\u000d\u000a      with the consent of a majority of MPs for constituencies in England'\u000d\u000a      (pp.8-9). The direct influence of FoES II has been acknowledged by Lord\u000d\u000a      McKay: `[I]t was essential to understand how the electorate in England\u000d\u000a      viewed present arrangements, and what if any adjustments they considered\u000d\u000a      necessary... These demands were fully met by the FoES 2012...The FoES was\u000d\u000a      in short an essential, clear and helpful foundation for the Commission's\u000d\u000a      understanding of the contents and direction of the \"English Question\" in\u000d\u000a      spring of 2013. On that basis the Commission was enabled to make proposals\u000d\u000a      for a solution to the West Lothian Question' (5.7).\u000d\u000a    Third, the most prominent FoES finding - of an increasingly distinct\u000d\u000a      English identity and growing demand for institutional recognition of that\u000d\u000a      identity - has influenced the Labour Party's constitutional thinking.\u000d\u000a      Several left-leaning blogs immediately responded to the first FoES report\u000d\u000a      by arguing for a new Labour approach towards England. That challenge was\u000d\u000a      taken up by senior Labour figures, including John Denham, Private\u000d\u000a      Secretary to Labour Leader Ed Miliband, who blogged on the IPPR website in\u000d\u000a      late-January 2012 about the need for Labour to develop a positive `case\u000d\u000a      for a progressive England,' referring directly to the FoES' finding of\u000d\u000a      resentment among the English: that they `feel like they are losing out and\u000d\u000a      being treated less fairly than the others' (5.8). Denham advocated a\u000d\u000a      response based in the revitalisation of English local government rather\u000d\u000a      than special procedures for English laws at Westminster. These thoughts\u000d\u000a      were expanded upon in a major speech by Ed Miliband in June 2012 in which\u000d\u000a      Miliband argued that `the best reflection of devolution to Scotland and\u000d\u000a      Wales in England lies in taking power out of Whitehall and devolving it\u000d\u000a      down to local authorities'; Miliband's Senior Advisor has confirmed that\u000d\u000a      `[t]he report on English attitudes was studied by Ed's advisers, and\u000d\u000a      helped inform the speech he gave at the Royal Festival Hall last year. We\u000d\u000a      all recognise the growing importance of this agenda and your research has\u000d\u000a      proved an invaluable resource for us' (5.9). Other senior Labour figures,\u000d\u000a      notably the Shadow Minister for Political and Constitutional Reform, while\u000d\u000a      taking a rather different line in advocating special procedures for\u000d\u000a      English laws at Westminster, have also referred directly to FoES findings\u000d\u000a      in developing their arguments (5.10).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Politics staff at the University of Edinburgh (Henderson and Jeffery),\u000d\u000a      working in collaboration with colleagues at Cardiff University and the\u000d\u000a      Institute for Public Policy Research, have conducted research (2007-13) on\u000d\u000a      changing political identities and constitutional attitudes in England.\u000d\u000a      This work has informed public debates about the place of England and\u000d\u000a      Englishness within the United Kingdom; has shaped the findings of the\u000d\u000a      McKay Commission; and has influenced the constitutional thinking of the\u000d\u000a      Labour party.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    The University of Edinburgh\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Edinburgh (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Edinburgh","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007790}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aHenderson, Ailsa (2007), Hierarchies of Belonging: National Identity\u000d\u000a        and Political Culture in Scotland and Quebec.

Focusing on devolution in the\u000d\u000a      UK, Jeffery (2009) has suggested that its impact on England could be\u000d\u000a      conceptualised as a process of delineation by default, insofar as\u000d\u000a      devolution had effectively left England institutionally on its own; but\u000d\u000a      also, increasingly, delineation by design, as political actors made the\u000d\u000a      case for distinct mechanisms\/institutions to govern England.\u000d\u000a    These and other ideas about the delineation of Englishness were explored\u000d\u000a      through a `Future of England Survey' (FoES), conducted in 2011 through a\u000d\u000a      collaboration between Edinburgh, Cardiff and the Institute for Public\u000d\u000a      Policy Research (IPPR). Plentiful anecdotal evidence suggested that\u000d\u000a      identity patterns in England were changing; FoES was designed to provide\u000d\u000a      systematic evidence about the extent to which people identified as\u000d\u000a      English, defined England as their political community, and sought\u000d\u000a      England-specific institutional arrangements to reflect this sense of\u000d\u000a      community. The survey built on a previous major study led by Henderson and\u000d\u000a      Jeffery on Citizenship after the Nation-State (CANS), coordinated through\u000d\u000a      the European Science Foundation and funded by national funders in five\u000d\u000a      states. The first FoES survey was carried out by YouGov in July 2011, with\u000d\u000a      findings publicly presented in January 2012. A second wave (FoES II) was\u000d\u000a      conducted in autumn 2012, to test the robustness of the original findings,\u000d\u000a      provide more detailed evidence on ethnic minorities in England, and\u000d\u000a      explore the relationship between attitudes to England's `two unions' &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      UK and EU.\u000d\u000a    The main findings of the FoES surveys have been:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      while dual Anglo-British national identities persist, there appears to\u000d\u000a        be increasing emphasis on the English aspect;\u000d\u000a      there are few regional or socio-economic distinctions in attitudes,\u000d\u000a        with the significant exception of ethnicity: ethnic minority respondents\u000d\u000a        are significantly more likely to stress a British identity;\u000d\u000a      there is substantial and growing support for England to be explicitly\u000d\u000a        recognised in the governing structures of the UK. This sentiment has not\u000d\u000a        crystallised behind a specific constitutional form, but encompasses\u000d\u000a        support for England to be dealt with as a distinct unit (there is little\u000d\u000a        support for English regionalism) and substantially declining support for\u000d\u000a        the territorial status quo. There is also strong evidence of increasing\u000d\u000a        `devo-anxiety': resentment at the privileged position devolution is\u000d\u000a        perceived to have granted Scotland within the UK;\u000d\u000a      the greater an individual's sense of English identity, the more likely\u000d\u000a        they are to support an English dimension (whether an English parliament\u000d\u000a        of some version of English votes for English laws at Westminster);\u000d\u000a      national identity and devo-anxiety are both strongly related to\u000d\u000a        attitudes towards England's `other Union', the EU. Those with a stronger\u000d\u000a        English identity are also more likely to adopt a hostile attitude\u000d\u000a        towards UK membership of the EU; perhaps counter-intuitively, a more\u000d\u000a        British national identity is associated with more positive EU attitudes.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23978","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research has had impact on three sets of beneficiaries: Commission\u000d\u000a      management, the UK\u000d\u000a      Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), and the Scottish Government.\u000d\u000a    First, the research provided senior management in the Commission with a\u000d\u000a      detailed analysis of\u000d\u000a      the backgrounds, careers and attitudes of its officials.

These\u000d\u000a      include an\u000d\u000a      overview to 50 top managers at the Directors General weekly meeting in\u000d\u000a      July 2010; briefings to\u000d\u000a      senior management teams in six different Directorates-General from July to\u000d\u000a      Oct 2011; a\u000d\u000a      presentation to the Cabinet of the Vice President of the\u000d\u000a      Commission in July 2012; and, in\u000d\u000a      September 2012, a presentation to the Commission's Senior Management\u000d\u000a      Review, attended by\u000d\u000a      senior 400 managers and addressed by the President of the Commission, the\u000d\u000a      Vice President of\u000d\u000a      the Commission, and the Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.\u000d\u000a      Senior management\u000d\u000a      have requested video recordings of these events, copies of the\u000d\u000a      presentation slides, and DG-\u000d\u000a      specific policy briefings.\u000d\u000a    The value senior management attached to the results is indicated by the\u000d\u000a      President of the\u000d\u000a      Commission sharing a platform with a member of the project team to address\u000d\u000a      senior\u000d\u000a      Commission officials for the September 2012 event; and the Commission\u000d\u000a      profiling the research\u000d\u000a      in its in-house magazine Commission en Direct. The President\u000d\u000a      commented in January 2010 that\u000d\u000a      `The project's findings will help us make the Commission a more efficient\u000d\u000a      and effective\u000d\u000a      administration that better serves European citizens' (5.1)\u000d\u000a    More specifically, the project findings have helped inform Commission\u000d\u000a      management's\u000d\u000a      knowledge of its own officials, enabling them to `develop a more fine\u000d\u000a      grain understanding of the\u000d\u000a      view of staff' (Secretary General of the European Commission) (5.2). The\u000d\u000a      Secretary General has\u000d\u000a      confirmed that the findings `fed into discussions... on recruitment,\u000d\u000a      career progression, reform\u000d\u000a      and reform management' (5.3). The Learning and Development Unit of DG\u000d\u000a      Human Resources\u000d\u000a      and Security organised a lunchtime seminar in July 2013 at which Hussein\u000d\u000a      and Peterson\u000d\u000a      presented the findings to 200 officials from across the organisation. The\u000d\u000a      Head of Unit noted that\u000d\u000a      the turnout `was very impressive and the feedback has been extremely\u000d\u000a      positive'. He has\u000d\u000a      requested copies of the key publication to use for training purposes\u000d\u000a      (5.3).\u000d\u000a    Second, analysis of the nationality and career profiles of Commission\u000d\u000a      officials contributed to\u000d\u000a      Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) reflections on how the UK can\u000d\u000a      improve the\u000d\u000a      recruitment of British nationals to the European administration. In August\u000d\u000a      2012 Kassim delivered\u000d\u000a      a presentation at the FCO to an audience of 40 civil servants from across\u000d\u000a      Whitehall, focusing on\u000d\u000a      the representation of British officials at the Commission. The UK is the\u000d\u000a      most poorly represented\u000d\u000a      member state in the Commission, and especially under-represented in\u000d\u000a      powerful DGs such as\u000d\u000a      Competition, Economic and Financial Policy and Agriculture. Following the\u000d\u000a      meeting, the Europe\u000d\u000a      Director in the FCO wrote that `we received a lot of positive feedback on\u000d\u000a      the event and on the\u000d\u000a      research that you provided, including at Ministerial level' (5.4) She\u000d\u000a      stated that the research had\u000d\u000a      `served to confirm or crystallise a number of important points for us,\u000d\u000a      enhanced our\u000d\u000a      understanding of the key issues, and the policy advice you gave on the\u000d\u000a      back of your research\u000d\u000a      has provided valuable food-for-thought'. More specifically, she noted that\u000d\u000a      `your research will\u000d\u000a      feed into HMG's policy analysis and formulation regarding how to take\u000d\u000a      forward the recruitment\u000d\u000a      agenda over the next 6 months' (5.5). Connolly and Kassim subsequently\u000d\u000a      participated in a\u000d\u000a      `brainstorming' meeting with senior officials on the future of recruitment\u000d\u000a      policy.\u000d\u000a    Third, the research has informed the Scottish Government about the staff\u000d\u000a      of the Commission. At\u000d\u000a      this critical juncture of Scottish politics, there is recognition that\u000d\u000a      officials from across the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government will need to engage more effectively with officials across the\u000d\u000a      Commission. In\u000d\u000a      November 2012, Peterson and Kassim presented the findings of the project\u000d\u000a      to the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government at an event organised with the External Affairs Division,\u000d\u000a      attracting officials from\u000d\u000a      seven different divisions (5.5). A questionnaire completed by attendees\u000d\u000a      confirmed the value of\u000d\u000a      the session in adding new knowledge about the organization. In written\u000d\u000a      comments, participants\u000d\u000a      agreed that the briefing had facilitated a more nuanced understanding of\u000d\u000a      Commission officials'\u000d\u000a      backgrounds and views, providing attendees with a better sense of how to\u000d\u000a      liaise when engaging\u000d\u000a      with the administration (5.6).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    A major survey of the European Commission (2008-10), carried out by an\u000d\u000a      international team coled\u000d\u000a      by John Peterson, has had three forms of impact.

The\u000d\u000a      project was initially developed within a research group led by Peterson as\u000d\u000a      part of an EU-funded\u000d\u000a      (FP6) EU-CONSENT network. The research was subsequently funded by an ESRC\u000d\u000a      grant\u000d\u000a      entitled `The European Commission in Question', for which Hussein Kassim\u000d\u000a      (University of East\u000d\u000a      Anglia) was PI, and Peterson Co-I. Peterson took primary responsibility\u000d\u000a      for liaison with the\u000d\u000a      Commission's administration and leadership (including the\u000d\u000a      Secretary-General and President) on\u000d\u000a      all operational questions as well as pre-testing of the survey\u000d\u000a      questionnaire. Other members of\u000d\u000a      the team were Andrew Thompson, University of Edinburgh (UoA 22); Michael\u000d\u000a      W.

The online survey was\u000d\u000a      administered in\u000d\u000a      2008 and the interviews conducted in 2009.\u000d\u000a    The project came at a critical time for the European Commission, which\u000d\u000a      had recently undergone\u000d\u000a      a series of substantial upheavals: major internal reform in the 1990s, and\u000d\u000a      the recruitment of\u000d\u000a      more than 3,500 new officials from 12 new member states following the\u000d\u000a      2004-7 enlargements.\u000d\u000a      No large scale attitudinal study of Commission officials had ever been\u000d\u000a      conducted, thus creating\u000d\u000a      clear demand &#8212; on the part of both Commission senior management and EU\u000d\u000a      scholars &#8212; for\u000d\u000a      detailed and systematic data on the organization. The European Commission\u000d\u000a      in Question was a\u000d\u000a      landmark project that addresses key questions about the Commission and its\u000d\u000a      staff. Developing\u000d\u000a      original data, based on responses to an online survey (n=1901)\u000d\u000a      representative of nationality,\u000d\u000a      gender, length of service and seniority, and a structured programme of\u000d\u000a      interviews with\u000d\u000a      Commissioners (n=5), cabinet members (n=28) and managers (n=119), the\u000d\u000a      survey delivered\u000d\u000a      new knowledge about:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the educational and professional backgrounds of Commission officials;\u000d\u000a      the motivations of officials for joining the organization, their\u000d\u000a        career trajectories, and\u000d\u000a        networking behaviour;\u000d\u000a      officials' ideological values, preferred vision of the EU and\u000d\u000a        attitudes toward the expansion of\u000d\u000a        EU competencies;\u000d\u000a      attitudes within the organization to the impact of administrative\u000d\u000a        reform and of the 2004 and\u000d\u000a        2007 enlargements.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The project exposes as myths several widely accepted wisdoms about the\u000d\u000a      Commission. First, it\u000d\u000a      shows that the Commission is neither an administration of lawyers, nor is\u000d\u000a      it populated by life-long bureaucrats with no experience outside Brussels. Indeed, the\u000d\u000a      Commission employs more\u000d\u000a      economists and more scientists than lawyers and at least a third of\u000d\u000a      officials come from private\u000d\u000a      enterprise. Second, although attracted to Brussels by a `commitment to\u000d\u000a      Europe', officials are not\u000d\u000a      `federalists'. Only a minority of officials would like to see the\u000d\u000a      Commission become the\u000d\u000a      government of Europe, thereby challenging the view that they want only to\u000d\u000a      extend the\u000d\u000a      competences of the EU and therefore their own power. Moreover, officials\u000d\u000a      would like `more\u000d\u000a      Europe' in certain fields, but believe that there should be `less Europe'\u000d\u000a      in agriculture. Third,\u000d\u000a      political affiliation and experience in a Commissioner's private office\u000d\u000a      (`cabinet') do not affect\u000d\u000a      career progression. Gender does play a role in that the small number of\u000d\u000a      women in managerial\u000d\u000a      posts have reached that position more rapidly than their male\u000d\u000a      counterparts, but there is no\u000d\u000a      evidence that, recruitment associated with enlargement apart, nationality\u000d\u000a      affects promotion.\u000d\u000a      Finally, the Commission is not an antiquated bureaucracy, resistant to\u000d\u000a      reform. The reforms\u000d\u000a      undertaken under the Prodi Commission (1999-2004) modernized the\u000d\u000a      Commission, bringing it\u000d\u000a      into line with other administrations.\u000d\u000a    Three further findings were important and point to future challenges for\u000d\u000a      the organization: officials\u000d\u000a      were dissatisfied with the way that enlargement was handled, especially in\u000d\u000a      regards to the career\u000d\u000a      prospects for officials joining after 1 May 2004; underrepresentation of\u000d\u000a      large member states &#8212; France, Germany, Poland and the UK &#8212; threatens the legitimacy and efficacy\u000d\u000a      of the\u000d\u000a      Commission; and differing values between officials from old and new member\u000d\u000a      states may lead\u000d\u000a      to intra-departmental tensions and are likely to threaten settled policy\u000d\u000a      nostrums.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24896","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    At a time when public confidence in politics and politicians is very low\u000a      in Britain, the widespread dissemination of the research has helped to\u000a      improve public understanding about parliament, both at an elite-level, and\u000a      then indirectly through TV, radio and press to an audience of millions.\u000a      Citations by high profile parliamentarians and acknowledgements from the\u000a      widest range of political journalists demonstrate that Cowley's research\u000a      has helped to inform political debate in the UK, providing evidence to\u000a      help combat mythology.[source 1]\u000a    The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, has made repeated references to the\u000a      work, as helping to demolish the myth of the slavish backbencher. As he\u000a      said:\u000a    I undertake considerable outreach work with the public, and especially\u000a      schools and colleges, to try to engage them with politics and Parliament.\u000a      I often make reference to the work of Professor Cowley when trying to\u000a      persuade audiences that today's MPs are not, as many think, obedient but\u000a      in fact have become increasingly rebellious and independent. His research\u000a      is therefore invaluable in providing a reliable and up-to-date account of\u000a      the behaviour of MPs and helping to demolish so many myths about their\u000a      behaviour.[2]\u000a    There is an acknowledged improvement in the quality of political\u000a      reporting, ensuring that it is informed by the latest and most up-to-date\u000a      political research. As Robert Hutton, the parliamentary correspondent for\u000a      Bloomberg, has said, the research `has fundamentally changed how\u000a        political reporters view the behaviour of MPs. As both journalists\u000a      and parliamentarians have adjusted to the new reality of coalition, their\u000a      work is consulted on a constant basis by every lobby correspondent I\u000a      know'.\u000a    Further positive feedback on the impact of the research has come\u000a      from sources such as: Gary Gibbon, the Political Editor of Channel 4, who\u000a      said that the research was `priceless', `essential' and had `informed and\u000a      improved' his reporting; Andrew Sparrow, of the Guardian said that\u000a      it `makes a significant contribution to the public understanding of\u000a        parliament'; Mark D'Arcy, who presents Yesterday in Parliament for\u000a      Radio 4, argued that the research provided an alternative, objective\u000a      source, `the kind of perspectives... that used to be the presence of a few\u000a      astute party whips'.\u000a    In May 2010, the Guardian dedicated its `In Praise of...' leader\u000a      to Cowley. They said:\u000a    Rare is the scholar that penetrates beyond the academy and into public\u000a        consciousness. The work of Nottingham's Philip Cowley has indisputably\u000a        made the leap... Cowley took the trouble to measure the historical\u000a      truth, and demolished the myth, and now every punter worth their salt\u000a      knows that there are more rebel hearts than ever among today's MPs. [the\u000a      research] is so authoritative that even the whips use it....[3]\u000a    Indeed, some products of the research &#8212; such as the claim that the\u000a        current parliament is the most rebellious of the post-war era &#8212; have now\u000a        entered the political blood stream, and become so widespread that\u000a      they get cited back to Cowley by practitioners, who are often unaware of\u000a      where they originally came from.[4] In July 2008 one finding (that Gordon\u000a      Brown suffered more rebellions in his first month than any other post-war\u000a      Prime Minister) was even used (uncredited) as a quiz question on Channel\u000a      5's The Wright Stuff!\u000a    The key to achieving such widespread understanding of the work has been a\u000a      many-layered approach to dissemination:\u000a    \u000a      The establishment of a research-based website (www.revolts.co.uk), to disseminate\u000a        findings. This was set up in 2004 &#8212; before blogging became fashionable\u000a        in academia &#8212; and has been regularly updated since. It became\u000a          routinely used by journalists and politicians alike as their source of\u000a          data on backbench behaviour. When the resource to fund the site\u000a        looked in jeopardy, it was cited as `one of the best examples of the\u000a        type of impact the academy should seek to emulate' (by Sunder Katwala,\u000a        then of the Fabian Society); Ben Brogan (of the Telegraph)\u000a        described it as a `groundbreaking project [which] has over the years\u000a        established itself as a vital reference point for politics'. Its funding\u000a        was also raised in the Commons.[5]\u000a      Supplementation of the website by other social media, of which\u000a        the most obvious is Twitter &#8212; where Cowley has over 6,200 followers,\u000a        including almost all senior political journalists &#8212; and postings on\u000a        other blogs and outlets, especially Nottingham's Ballots and Bullets\u000a        site, where he posts regular explanatory updates on developments in the\u000a        Commons.[6] But however disseminated, the principle has been the same:\u000a        to highlight and explain current developments in parliament, drawing on\u000a        the research.\u000a      Production of regular briefing notes, applying the research to\u000a        ongoing developments in the Commons. These have put rebellions into\u000a        their historical context; provided benchmarks and ready reckoners for\u000a        journalists to use; discussed and explored the motivations of rebels;\u000a        and explained the outcome of votes. As well as being disseminated\u000a        online, these briefing papers were also sent to political journalists\u000a        and columnists with whom Cowley had contacts. In addition, every\u000a          year since 2008 the project has published an end-of session (or\u000a          end-of-Parliament) report, detailing rebellions in the previous\u000a        year, which has been widely disseminated to stakeholders, as well as\u000a        available free-of-charge online. The 2013 report was launched at the\u000a        British Academy in May 2013 and its findings were reported on outlets\u000a        including: the World At One (on Radio 4), Yesterday in Parliament (also\u000a        Radio 4), the Daily Politics (BBC2), Channel 4 News, the Guardian,\u000a          Telegraph, Express, Bloomberg, Huffington Post, and\u000a        BusinessWeek. Previous reports have attracted similar coverage.\u000a      Frequent written contributions for outlets which reach beyond the\u000a          academic community. Articles have been written both for the\u000a        national press (such as The Times and Guardian) and more\u000a        specialised publications (such as The House Magazine and Total\u000a          Politics) and websites (such as LibDem Voice and ConservativeHome).\u000a        Examples of authored articles by Cowley include: in The Times:\u000a        `Biggest rebellion to date is sign of trouble to come' (23 October\u000a        2011); `Rebels with few previous causes' (9 December 2010); in the Guardian:\u000a        `Who will be bravest in the tuition fees vote?'

(8 January 2009).\u000a      \u000aExposure for the research on broadcast media. The research\u000a        formed the subject of Cowley's authored lecture for Radio 4\u000a        (`Forethought'), first broadcast 25 May 2011, with an estimated audience\u000a        of 450,000. Other broadcast media appearances discussing the research\u000a        have included every major broadcaster in the UK.\u000a      High profile talks at seminars and events organised outside\u000a          academia, including those organised by the House of Commons\u000a        library, the Lords Speaker, and the Government whips.[7] These have\u000a        included events organised by lobbyists and thinktanks. Chris Rumfitt, a\u000a        Managing Director of Edelman, the world's largest PR company, described\u000a        a presentation to their Public Affairs team as `of a sort that we\u000a          would just be unable to get from any other source... colleagues\u000a        found it interesting and extremely useful in helping them understand\u000a        developments at Westminster, and I know that it has helped inform our\u000a        work since then'. Greg Power, the Director of Global Partners, for whom\u000a        several sessions on dissent have been run, said: `we only work with\u000a        academics... whose expertise is applicable... Cowley provides exactly\u000a        this sort of expertise.'[8]\u000a    \u000a    As a result of this proactive dissemination strategy, findings from\u000a        the research have been covered by all major media outlets in the UK and\u000a        beyond, including multiple features in every major British\u000a      newspaper, on BBC (radio and television), Channel 4, Sky News, ITV, along\u000a      with a host of overseas outlets. Listing the occasions when the research\u000a      has been cited in the media or Parliament would itself take up more than\u000a      the length of this case study. As illustrative examples only, see\u000a      the following, all of which are reports based entirely on the research:\u000a      `Backbenchers more rebellious than at any stage since World War Two' (Independent,\u000a      9 May 2012); `Gordon Brown faced more revolts last year than any PM since\u000a      Edward Heath' (Guardian, 4 December 2008); `Gordon Brown suffers\u000a      backbench rebellions as he struggles to control party', Telegraph,\u000a      17 November 2009); `Gordon Brown struggles to maintain discipline after\u000a      103 rebellions', Times, 26 December 2008; `Rebel MPs who vote\u000a      against the Government' (BBC Daily Politics, 24 January 2011);\u000a      `Labour's rebellious streak' BBC Website, 25 February 2011).

It has looked at the\u000a      drivers of rebellion and at the attitudes and behaviour of the party\u000a      whips. The research is mixed methods work, combining quantitative analysis\u000a      of parliamentary division lists with extensive elite interviewing.\u000a    From 2002 onwards, during his tenure at Nottingham University, Cowley has\u000a      published one monograph on the subject, and more than 20 academic articles\u000a      and chapters. Amongst other things, the research has demonstrated the\u000a      increased rebelliousness and independence of MPs (publications #1, #2). It\u000a      helped demolish the myth that MPs were increasingly loyal and cohesive,\u000a      rather showing that independence and rebellion were reaching\u000a      record-breaking levels (#2). This has been true both in terms of frequency\u000a      and quantity, with MPs rebelling more often and in larger numbers &#8212;\u000a      although the work has also shown that it is not true of every issue (#3).\u000a      This effect has also been true in terms of policy consequence &#8212; with the\u000a      research tracking both the formal defeats and informal retreats and\u000a      concessions performed by government in the face of backbench opposition.\u000a      Early research into the post-2010 coalition government has confirmed this\u000a      trend (#4).\u000a    Research has also examined free-votes, those on so-called issues of\u000a      conscience &#8212; demonstrating the fundamental party division that is present\u000a      in the Commons, even on issues that are supposedly non-party, such as\u000a      abortion or homosexuality, and the extent to which the outcome of the vote\u000a      is dependent on the party composition of the Commons (#5). It has tracked\u000a      the motivations of those rebelling &#8212; showing the importance of experience,\u000a      ideology, and past behaviour &#8212; and also the gendered dimension to the\u000a      behaviour, especially that seen under New Labour, with the large cohort of\u000a      women MPs elected in 1997 and then in 2005.

The project\u000a      covered eight countries and\u000a      had a budget of 178,000 Euros.\u000a    The research collaboration led to the publication of SIGMA Paper Nr.\u000a        44 in May 2009.[source 2]\u000a      The findings were widely disseminated, directly and indirectly, and well\u000a      beyond SIGMA and DG\u000a      Enlargement and DG Administration (now DG Human Resources) of the European\u000a      Commission.\u000a    Meyer-Sahling presented the research first at the 2nd SIGMA\u000a      Networking Seminar in Paris in\u000a      November 2008 to senior officials from SIGMA, the European Commission,\u000a        Central and\u000a        Eastern European and Western Balkan states.

Bob Bonwitt, Director of the SIGMA programme from 1992-2012,\u000a      writes that the\u000a      report `helped us to rethink the evidence base of what we were doing and\u000a      forced us to address\u000a      ideas that had been taken for granted. [...] the study produced such\u000a      interesting results that\u000a      similar studies were carried out in other areas of public administration\u000a      reform'.[1]\u000a    2) Inspired further studies, three of which Meyer-Sahling was\u000a      directly involved in. They include\u000a      a report on the political, economic, social and international determinants\u000a      of civil service reform,\u000a      a SIGMA Policy Brief on `Can Civil Service Reforms Last?', and a major\u000a      study on the\u000a      professionalization of the civil service in the Western Balkans, which\u000a      included all seven\u000a      Western Balkan states and had a budget of 175,000 Euros. The project led\u000a      to the publication\u000a        of SIGMA Paper Nr 48 in September 2012.[3] The preliminary findings\u000a      were presented at a\u000a      SIGMA staff meeting in November 2011, at a dedicated workshop to senior\u000a      officials of the\u000a      Government of Montenegro and at the 2013 ReSPA Annual Conference. The\u000a      conference was\u000a      attended by ministers of public administration and senior policy-makers\u000a      from the Western\u000a      Balkans, the European Commission and other international organisations.[8]\u000a      According to\u000a      Francisco Cardona, SIGMA's principal official for civil service reform\u000a      since the late 1990s, `the\u000a      study on the Western Balkans is progressively acquiring importance as a\u000a      reference document\u000a      in training sessions, conferences and meetings on public administration\u000a      reform in the\u000a      concerned regions'.[1]\u000a    3) Plays a critical role in the development of ReSPA as a\u000a      regional centre for public\u000a      administration reform and development, in particular, the upgrading of its\u000a      Network in Human\u000a      Resource Management. The Commission official responsible for the SIGMA and\u000a      ReSPA file at\u000a      DG Enlargement, writes `the kind of actions that [Meyer-Sahling] has\u000a      carried out [...] is very\u000a      much in line with what we [i.e. DG Enlargement] are currently looking for\u000a      in terms of providing\u000a      evidence-based assessments, concrete and clear actions and assure a\u000a      continuous monitoring\u000a      of improvements under a realistic and customised approach'. Specifically\u000a      with regard to the\u000a      development of ReSPA as a regional centre for public administration\u000a      reform, she goes on that\u000a      [Meyer-Sahling] will `play a critical role in upgrading the ReSPA Network\u000a      in Human Resource\u000a      Management'.[1]\u000a    4) Contributed to a change of strategy towards a holistic,\u000a      context-sensitive approach to public\u000a      administration reform in accession states. Bonwitt explains that `the\u000a      findings caused a shift of\u000a      our priorities [...] we changed the priorities of some of the system\u000a      components and worked\u000a      more on the political economy of civil service reform'. Moreover, `we\u000a      presented the result to the\u000a      EC [i.e. European Commission], which then commissioned the Balkan study\u000a      and accepted that\u000a      their approach to reform in the Balkans needed to be reconsidered'.[1]\u000a    5) Influenced operations of SIGMA and the European Commission.\u000a      Bonwitt and Cardona\u000a      write that `[t]he studies caused some changes in our [i.e. SIGMA's]\u000a      assessment methodology'\u000a      and `SIGMA used the findings for annual assessments of individual\u000a      countries'.[1] The\u000a      European Commission refers to the study on the professionalization of the\u000a      Western Balkans in\u000a      the specification and justification of project fiches that advertise EU\u000a      funded aid and assistance\u000a      projects in the area of good governance.\u000a    Influence in the national arena of Lithuania\u000a    Following the presentation of SIGMA Paper Nr 44, the Government of\u000a        Lithuania requested a\u000a        separate study on the Modernisation of the Lithuanian Civil Service.[4]\u000a      The study, prepared\u000a      together with Prof Vitalis Nakrosis from Vilnius University, was presented\u000a      in February 2010 in the\u000a      Lithuanian Parliament in a session organised by the Committee for the\u000a      State Administration and\u000a      Local Government.[7] After the conference, Parliament passed a\u000a        Resolution, which has\u000a      become an important reference point for civil service reform in\u000a      Lithuania.[10] The studies,\u000a      presentations and an academic article that was published after the\u000a      conference generated public\u000a      debate over the course of civil service reform in the Lithuanian media.[9]\u000a    Most importantly, the Government of Lithuania followed the studies'\u000a      recommendations for\u000a      the development of a new reform strategy and the amendment of civil\u000a        service regulations.\u000a      According to the Deputy Head of the Civil Service, `the study by\u000a      Meyer-Sahling and Nakrosis was\u000a      extremely useful for the staff of the Civil Service Department. We used\u000a      the report for the analysis of\u000a      the civil service systems and for making proposals for the improvement of\u000a      its legal regulation. [...]\u000a      For instance, we have implemented the recommendations concerning the\u000a      tenure of heads of\u000a      institutions, which came into force in 2011 and the centralised selection\u000a      of civil servants, which will\u000a      come into force on 1 July 2013. [T]he recommendation linking civil service\u000a      training and\u000a      competency management is being implemented in the context of a project\u000a      funded by the European\u000a      Social Fund'.[1]\u000a    The findings and recommendations have been incorporated in the final\u000a      report of the Sunset\u000a      Commission of the Lithuanian Government. Most recently, the Government\u000a      used the studies in a\u000a      press release in order to justify the appointment of the new Head of the\u000a      Lithuanian Civil Service in\u000a      February 2013.\u000a    Wider dissemination in the post-communist world and China\u000a    The Government of Lithuania used the findings in international\u000a      co-collaborations across the entire\u000a      post-communist world and China. The Deputy Head of the Lithuanian Civil\u000a      Service writes that\u000a      `[a]fter the publication of the 2009 SIGMA Report, responsible officials\u000a      from the Balkan and Eastern\u000a      Neighbourhood Countries (...) expressed their wish to familiarise\u000a      themselves with the Lithuanian\u000a      experience.

One of the major objectives of post-communist transformation has\u000a      been to overcome the\u000a      legacy of over-politicisation by establishing professional and\u000a      de-politicised civil service systems.\u000a    Meyer-Sahling's innovative research on the establishment of meritocratic\u000a      civil service systems in\u000a      Central and Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans examined the\u000a      effectiveness of EU\u000a      interventions before and after accession. The research provides analytical\u000a      tools for the\u000a      identification of strengths and weaknesses of the institutional frameworks\u000a      underpinning civil service\u000a      management, and lays out conditions for success at both the level of\u000a      recipient states and the EU\u000a      level.\u000a    At least two key innovations have resulted from Meyer-Sahling's research:\u000a    1. New conceptual frameworks have been developed for analysis of civil\u000a      service reform. For\u000a      the first time, these place the outcomes of reform in the context both of\u000a      regime transition\u000a      and of integration into the European Administrative Space, taking into\u000a      account previous\u000a      characteristics of communist-type administration as well as the\u000a      established patterns of\u000a      public administration in Western democracies (publications #1, #3).\u000a    2. Domestic and international determinants of civil service reform and\u000a      professionalization have\u000a      been identified (#1, #2, #4, #5), specifically, the impact of:\u000a    i. Formal institutional design\u000a    ii. Reform design, sequences and leadership\u000a    iii. Political competition and patterns of government alternation\u000a    iv. The European Union, SIGMA and other international actors\u000a    v. The communist and pre-communist legacy of the past\u000a    The findings have helped policy-makers to distinguish between those\u000a      factors that may be directly\u000a      influenced, as opposed to contextual determinants that need to be taken\u000a      into account but cannot\u000a      be controlled. As a result, the research points to the need to `customise'\u000a      domestic reform initiatives\u000a      and international interventions by adapting institutional designs, reform\u000a      strategies and sequences.\u000a      (#1, #2, #4). It also helps to clarify the conditions under which civil\u000a      service reform achievements\u000a      become sustainable for the long-term, in particular, in the context of\u000a      European integration (#5).\u000a    The underpinning research was conducted by Meyer-Sahling and published in\u000a      single-authored,\u000a      peer-reviewed journal articles.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24898","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Goodwin's ground-breaking research into the profile and motivations of\u000a      right-wing extremists has\u000a      not only improved understanding at a crucial time for responding to the\u000a      emergence of new specific\u000a      groups and isolated acts of violence, but helped change attitudes and\u000a      behaviour through training,\u000a      informed policy thinking and development at local community and government\u000a      level in the UK, and\u000a      internationally.\u000a    International Knowledge Exchange\u000a      Between 2010 and August 2013, Goodwin was approached and engaged by over\u000a      80 non-academic\u000a      bodies who invited him to share his research in workshop format and engage\u000a      in robust\u000a      dialogue. In North America these include the National Intelligence\u000a      Council, Central Intelligence\u000a      Agency and Eurasia Group think-tank. In Europe they include the Council of\u000a      Europe, European\u000a      Parliament, Open Society Foundation and think tanks such as the Barcelona\u000a      Centre for\u000a      International Affairs (Cidob), Friedrich Ebert Stiftung and Kreisky Forum.\u000a    Influencing UK Government policy\u000a      Increasingly Goodwin has come to influence central government on the\u000a      issues surrounding the rise\u000a      of the extreme right in Britain. He has presented his research in workshop\u000a      format to the Home\u000a      Office, Government for Wales and many others (below). He contributed to\u000a      the UK Government's\u000a      Foresight Project on Future Identities. Dr Lucy Mason, the Joint\u000a      Deputy Head of Foresight, notes\u000a      that it `is among the most downloaded Foresight reports ever, with\u000a      more than 5,500 downloads\u000a      since launch' and `informed several strands of work in parts of\u000a        Government'.[2]\u000a    Other activity which helped to disseminate his work to UK government\u000a      include his oral evidence to\u000a      the Home Affairs Committee on violent radicalisation in 2011; his project\u000a      on right-wing extremism\u000a      for the Welsh Government in 2012; and his presentations to Members of the\u000a      European Parliament\u000a      in 2012-2013, with one MEP describing Goodwin's research as `valuable to\u000a      our work', and `has\u000a      helped influence our work and perspective on the rise of the\u000a      extreme right in Britain, as well as\u000a      on a European scale'.[3]\u000a    From 2010, Goodwin was asked to write briefings for Ministers\u000a      Sayeeda Warsi, Oliver Letwin,\u000a      Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and All Party Parliamentary Group on\u000a      Islamophobia. In 2011,\u000a      this led to Goodwin's appointment to the cross-government working\u000a        group on anti-Muslim\u000a      hatred, responsible for allocating resources to tackle anti-Muslim\u000a      prejudice. After reviewing survey\u000a      data on extremism for the Department for Communities and Local Government\u000a      (DCLG), the\u000a      Department then supported Goodwin's successful bid for a six-month\u000a      full-time ESRC Knowledge\u000a      Exchange secondment to DCLG, from September 2012 until January 2013\u000a      (ES\/J020907\/1).\u000a      Goodwin was at the heart of central government, working with the\u000a      Tackling Extremism team on\u000a      his core area of research, convening a series of closed workshops designed\u000a      to trigger new\u000a      thinking, dozens of one-to-one meetings, writing submissions for\u000a      Ministers, organizing a\u000a      conference for over 70 policy-makers and a `master-class' for over 30\u000a      policy-makers at the Home\u000a      Office.\u000a    Claire Gipson, Head of Prevent Strategy at the Home Office\u000a      states: `It is fair to say that Dr\u000a      Goodwin's engagement with government on far right and EDL [English Defence\u000a      League] issues\u000a      has contributed directly to policy thinking and development',\u000a      while the Team Leader of the\u000a      Tackling Extremism division at DCLG notes: `It is clear that the work Dr\u000a      Goodwin did with\u000a      us...significantly accelerated and deepened our thinking, ensuring\u000a      that it is more rooted in the\u000a      latest evidence', and `his ability to provide evidence and analytical\u000a      input....were also valuable'.[4]\u000a    Such views are mirrored by the National Domestic Extremism Unit, who note\u000a      that Goodwin's\u000a      `research has greatly strengthened our understanding of the EDL [English\u000a      Defence League]...and\u000a      has covered gaps in our knowledge in a way that, as a police unit, we\u000a      would find difficult to\u000a      replicate'. In addition to her comments in Section 1, Baroness Warsi notes\u000a      that Goodwin\u000a      `significantly impacted on the public debate' while `changing our approach\u000a      to tackling\u000a      Islamophobia'.[5]. From February until July 2013 this extensive engagement\u000a      continued under the\u000a      University of Nottingham's Hermes Fellowship programme, funding two days\u000a      per week of further\u000a      knowledge exchange activity.\u000a    Influencing local government and community activity\u000a      Between 2010 and 2013 Goodwin engaged with 50-100 policy officers at\u000a      dozens of workshops\u000a      organized by the south-west Counter Terrorism Unit and Birmingham,\u000a      Burnley, Camden, Leicester,\u000a      Rochdale, Rotherham, Swindon, Tameside and Wigan councils. One Community\u000a      Cohesion policy\u000a      officer from Wrexham Council reflects on one workshop with 91 delegates in\u000a      2011 as follows: `By\u000a      addressing our knowledge gap this work has enabled us to develop our\u000a        local approach to\u000a        intelligence gathering'. Another in Burnley reflects: `We made\u000a        use of points and analyses from\u000a        his research in our management of government funded programmes on\u000a      community cohesion and\u000a      preventing violent extremism, including a leadership skills training\u000a      programme for young people,\u000a      and...through the Burnley Good Relations Programme'.\u000a    After a more detailed project in Tameside that mapped local support for\u000a      right-wing extremism an\u000a      officer notes how Goodwin `addressed a gap in our existing knowledge base\u000a      and has been\u000a        significant in shaping our work in local communities'. A period of\u000a      extensive engagement with\u000a      the Greater Manchester police Counter-Terrorism Unit produced similar\u000a      reflections:\u000a    Initially, we drew on Dr Goodwin's studies and research but it was\u000a        soon realised that\u000a        collaboration with him would have a significant impact on our ability to\u000a        change\u000a        attitudes and behaviour in the groups we most wanted to influence.\u000a      Consequently, we\u000a      worked together for two years both producing training materials for\u000a      teachers and lecturers,\u000a      and delivering conferences and training seminars. It would be accurate to\u000a      describe both Dr\u000a      Goodwin's research...and his personal involvement as critical in the\u000a        success of our\u000a        projects, which have subsequently influenced work in this area beyond\u000a        Manchester\u000a        to a regional and national level.\u000a    Non-governmental bodies also underscore this influence. The Community\u000a      Security Trust states\u000a      that this research `has significantly enhanced our knowledge of\u000a      these areas of extremist\u000a      politics, and is highly regarded'.

Owing to the emergence of\u000a      specific groups and isolated\u000a      acts of violence, this topic has become more salient to policy and\u000a      practitioner communities, and in\u000a      2011 the UK's national `Prevent' strategy noted how policy makers'\u000a      understanding of `how people\u000a      become involved' in right-wing extremism was inevitably less developed\u000a      than for other forms of\u000a      extremism. The same year saw the Home Affairs Committee on Violent\u000a      Radicalisation (see Section\u000a      4) conclude that agencies only paid `lip service' to right-wing extremism.\u000a    Goodwin addressed this gap directly by undertaking a series of distinct\u000a      projects that drew on a\u000a      combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to examine: (i)\u000a      extreme right party voters; (ii)\u000a      extreme right members and activists; and (iii) extreme right movements,\u000a      including their internal\u000a      organization, ideology and surrounding public opinion climate.\u000a    The research broke new ground by employing life-history interviews with\u000a      supporters, qualitative\u000a      textual analysis, the compilation of unique datasets on extreme right\u000a      party members and voters,\u000a      and sophisticated analysis of individual and contextual conditions that\u000a      tend to drive this support.\u000a      Specifically, the research investigated: (a) the social profile of\u000a      self-identified supporters of extreme\u000a      right-wing parties, such as the British National Party (BNP); (b) their\u000a      beliefs and attitudes, and key\u000a      motives for support; (c) the role of local contextual conditions at the\u000a      ward, local authority and\u000a      constituency levels, exploring for example the relationship between\u000a      support and levels of economic\u000a      deprivation, ethnic diversity and education; and (d) the organizational\u000a      and ideological evolution of\u000a      specific groups like the BNP, English Defence League, National Front, and\u000a      other smaller groups.\u000a      Critical research insights to emerge from the research were:\u000a    \u000a      Supporters share a distinct social profile and background, tending to\u000a        be middle-aged or\u000a        elderly working class men, with low levels of education, who read\u000a        tabloid newspapers and\u000a        occupy economically insecure positions (publications #1, #2, #3, #4).\u000a      Supporters reside in distinct types of areas, being heavily\u000a        concentrated in northern\u000a        England, the West Midlands and outer-London and in local authority areas\u000a        characterized by\u000a        high rates of deprivation and ethnic diversity, and who are in close\u000a        proximity to large\u000a        Muslim communities of Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage (#1, #2, #3,\u000a        #4).\u000a      Political parties and social movements on the extreme right-wing offer\u000a        particular and\u000a        defined narratives that amplify initial grievances into broader\u000a        `vocabularies of motive' that\u000a        sustain the commitment of followers, and compel them to action, and have\u000a        often pursued\u000a        relatively competent and targeted strategies at the community-level (#2,\u000a        #4, #5).\u000a      Members and activists exhibit an identifiable belief system and\u000a        `motivational vocabularies',\u000a        which are anchored in perceived threats to the native (ethnic) group,\u000a        feelings of collective\u000a        efficacy and a sense of moral obligation, challenging the notion that\u000a        they are simply\u000a        reactive protestors (#2).\u000a    \u000a    In summary, the research provides unique insight into the profile of\u000a      extreme right supporters, their\u000a      key grievances and issues of concern and the impact of their surrounding\u000a      environment.

This was matched by the usage of novel ways of\u000d\u000a      analysis\u000d\u000a      which made it possible, in contrast to earlier surveys, to test rivalling\u000d\u000a      interpretations\u000d\u000a      of the dynamics of public opinion. Although some of the underlying\u000d\u000a      analyses were\u000d\u000a      methodologically quite complex, Professor Van der Eijk was always able to\u000d\u000a      report\u000d\u000a      the resulting findings in non-technical ways, thus making the implications\u000d\u000a      of the data\u000d\u000a      more informative to the Committee as well as to a wider audience.[3]\u000d\u000a    Driven by its aim to explore British public perceptions of standards in\u000d\u000a      public life, CSPL then\u000d\u000a      financed a series of large-scale surveys of British public opinion between\u000d\u000a      2008 and 2012. These\u000d\u000a      studies were designed using the methodologies developed by Van der\u000d\u000a        Eijk, and were\u000d\u000a        analysed by him and his colleagues on the Research Advisory Board, and\u000d\u000a        formed the basis\u000d\u000a        of three major publications by the CSPL.[4] Additional analyses and\u000d\u000a      minor reports provided\u000d\u000a      materials for the Committee to formulate its policy recommendations about\u000d\u000a      more specific issues\u000d\u000a      including voter registration, MPs' expenses and allowances, political\u000d\u000a      party finance, best practice in\u000d\u000a      promoting good behaviour in public life and strengthening policy and law\u000d\u000a      on whistleblowing.[4]\u000d\u000a    The research conducted by Van der Eijk and his colleagues on the Research\u000d\u000a      Advisory Board\u000d\u000a      provided the empirical basis for the policy recommendations made by the\u000d\u000a      CSPL and in turn\u000d\u000a      informed government and parliament on issues concerning public probity in\u000d\u000a      general as well as on\u000d\u000a      more specific issues, such as party finance, MPs' expenses, and voter\u000d\u000a      registration. As the\u000d\u000a      Committee's Interim Chair, David Prince, notes: `...the underlying\u000d\u000a        research not only informs\u000d\u000a        policy recommendations... but also contributes to Government's and\u000d\u000a        Parliament's\u000d\u000a        understanding of how citizens experience and evaluate public probity'.[1]\u000d\u000a    The research conducted by Van der Eijk and other members of the Research\u000d\u000a      Advisory\u000d\u000a      Board on citizens' perceptions and evaluations of different procedures of\u000d\u000a      voter registration\u000d\u000a      informed the Government's new approach to voter's registration, by showing\u000d\u000a      that a broad\u000d\u000a      base of public acceptance existed for a system of individual registration\u000d\u000a      to replace the\u000d\u000a      system where one member of the household registers all eligible voters in\u000d\u000a      the household.\u000d\u000a      As Prince notes:\u000d\u000a    Without solid evidence of public acceptance of such a procedure it\u000d\u000a        would have\u000d\u000a        been much more difficult for the Committee to continue to lobby\u000d\u000a        Government for\u000d\u000a        this change... In 2012 the Government brought forward the Electoral\u000d\u000a          Registration\u000d\u000a        and Administration Bill to introduce individual voter\u000d\u000a        registration.[1]\u000d\u000a    Findings on citizens' perceptions and evaluations of donations to\u000d\u000a      political parties were also drawn\u000d\u000a      upon for the Committee's investigation into party finance. Research\u000d\u000a      findings demonstrated the\u000d\u000a      widespread concern and distrust amongst the public concerning all forms of\u000d\u000a      sponsorship of political\u000d\u000a      parties beyond a relatively low threshold, and a broad acceptance of the\u000d\u000a      principle of public co-funding\u000d\u000a      of political parties if that would drive out large donations by\u000d\u000a      individual, corporate, charitable\u000d\u000a      or union donors. As David Prince notes, the work revealed:\u000d\u000a    ...broad public support for a scheme of limited public financial\u000d\u000a      contributions to political\u000d\u000a      parties... [and] a ban on large donations to parties by individuals, group\u000d\u000a      or\u000d\u000a      organizations.

Van der Eijk presented the research in three\u000d\u000a      public seminars,\u000d\u000a      organised by the CSPL in 2008 (in collaboration with the Social Research\u000d\u000a      Association, the\u000d\u000a      Academy of Social Sciences and the British Library), in 2012 (at its\u000d\u000a      Annual Public Meeting),\u000d\u000a      and in 2013 (in collaboration with the Institute for Government). Each of\u000d\u000a      these events was\u000d\u000a      attended by 55-75 participants, including invited politicians and\u000d\u000a      regulators with an interest in\u000d\u000a      standards issues, delegates from independent think-tanks and from the\u000d\u000a      media.\u000d\u000a    As Ruth Fox, Director and Head of Research of the Hansard Society states:\u000d\u000a    ...the impact of the work of Professor Van der Eijk and his colleagues is\u000d\u000a      not limited to\u000d\u000a      providing an evidence base for policymaking and recommendations, but\u000d\u000a      extends much\u000d\u000a      more widely by making a distinct contribution to help inform and\u000d\u000a        sustain the work of\u000d\u000a        civil society organisations and parliamentary monitoring groups such\u000d\u000a      as the Hansard\u000d\u000a      Society.[2]\u000d\u000a    This contribution to wider public debate is evidenced in a number of\u000d\u000a      further ways, including\u000d\u000a      blogposts [5], the use of the research in depositions of evidence to the\u000d\u000a      Leveson inquiry [6], and\u000d\u000a      multiple references to the CSPL's recommendations in parliament and in the\u000d\u000a      media, including in\u000d\u000a      the Guardian, Independent, Financial Times, Daily\u000d\u000a        Mail, Telegraph, and Economist, and on the\u000d\u000a      BBC and Channel 4 [7]. As Fox concluded:\u000d\u000a    The true value of the CSPL studies is that they explore issues and themes\u000d\u000a      that are often\u000d\u000a      ignored in other surveys. Importantly, they also go beyond the surface\u000d\u000a      headlines of normal\u000d\u000a      opinion polls and provide in-depth analysis that yield rare in-depth\u000d\u000a      insights into networks of\u000d\u000a      perceptions, evaluations and experiences that usually remain `hidden' in\u000d\u000a      other studies of\u000d\u000a      public opinion.\u000d\u000a    She adds: `the national debate about the quality of our democracy in\u000d\u000a        Britain in recent years\u000d\u000a        would be all the poorer without it'.[2]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Sustained research in the field of advanced survey design, advanced\u000d\u000a      analysis of complex survey\u000d\u000a      data and the study of public opinion has enabled Professor Cees van der\u000d\u000a      Eijk to make a unique\u000d\u000a        and vital contribution to the work of the Cabinet Office's Committee on\u000d\u000a        Standards in Public\u000d\u000a        Life (CSPL).

Traditional approaches\u000d\u000a      often fail to describe\u000d\u000a      adequately patterns of multiple preferences held by individuals, and have\u000d\u000a      been unable to\u000d\u000a      distinguish between preferences that are unlikely to change and those that\u000d\u000a      can very easily shift\u000d\u000a      towards another option. These problems of inadequate description and of\u000d\u000a      overstating the stability\u000d\u000a      of preferences reaffirm themselves when individual level information is\u000d\u000a      aggregated to characterise\u000d\u000a      public opinion at large. Van der Eijk therefore developed a set of\u000d\u000a      interlocking new methods to\u000d\u000a      address these challenges.\u000d\u000a    These innovative methods involve new survey question formats for\u000d\u000a      assessing preferences (so-\u000d\u000a      called non-ipsative preference measures) (publication #1); the development\u000d\u000a      of designs for the\u000d\u000a      statistical analysis of such non-ipsative preferences in conjunction with\u000d\u000a      traditional preference\u000d\u000a      measures (so-called `stacked analysis' designs) (#1); the development of\u000d\u000a      new ways to assess the\u000d\u000a      impact of macro-conditions on public opinion and aggregated preferences\u000d\u000a      (#2, #3); and the\u000d\u000a      development of analysis designs to assess the elasticity of preferences at\u000d\u000a      individual and aggregate\u000d\u000a      levels of analysis (#1, #3, #4). Although these methods were originally\u000d\u000a      developed for application in\u000d\u000a      the field of electoral research, they are increasingly applied in other\u000d\u000a      substantive fields of research\u000d\u000a      involving preferences and public opinion, and were utilised in the\u000d\u000a      research conducted for the\u000d\u000a      CSPL.\u000d\u000a    Van der Eijk is also renowned for his expertise in making highly complex\u000d\u000a      data-structures amenable\u000d\u000a      to statistical analysis, as exemplified by his contribution to the\u000d\u000a      analysis of high-dimensional so-\u000d\u000a      called clickstream data (#5). This expertise made it possible to extract\u000d\u000a      more insightful results from\u000d\u000a      the studies conducted under the auspices of the CSPL.\u000d\u000a    These methodological innovations have been hailed by reviewers (see, for\u000d\u000a      example, Perspectives\u000d\u000a        on Politics, 2012: 535-536) as solutions for serious deficiencies in\u000d\u000a      previously existing scholarship,\u000d\u000a      both in terms of description and in terms of empirical modelling.

For example, the\u000a      Local Government Association report (LGA) [4] on immigration was part of\u000a      the LGA submission to\u000a      the House of Commons Select Committee on Migration [a]. This resulted in\u000a      the setting up of the\u000a      Migration Impact Fund of &#163;250 million per annum. Farnell's\u000a      research [3] led to the Church Urban\u000a      Fund report Churches in Action (with a foreword from the then\u000a      Archbishop of Canterbury) that\u000a      underpinned the new &#163;5 million Near Neighbours programme. These two\u000a      projects show how\u000a      cohesion research was used by various agencies to address the impact of\u000a      migration. These\u000a      projects establish the context for Beider's JRF research that has\u000a      had rapid, far reaching and\u000a      significant impact following its launch in November 2011 [5]. The report\u000a      was viewed 5,270 times\u000a      after publication, downloaded 1,150 times and the summary downloaded an\u000a      additional 825 times\u000a      from the JRF website. This puts the report and the summary in the top ten\u000a      downloaded documents\u000a      from the Foundation's Website during 2012.\u000a    Impact on creativity, culture and society\u000a      The report \"White working class communities\" [5] has caused public\u000a      and stakeholder debate\u000a      because the research has challenged conventional wisdom. Following\u000a      publication of the report,\u000a      Beider was interviewed live on Radio 5Live, Radio WM, Radio\u000a      Coventry and Warwickshire, Capital\u000a      Radio, BRMB and Three Counties Radio. The report was also covered in the\u000a      BBC Today\u000a      Programme (28 November 2011) and BBC TV Breakfast News. The report led to\u000a      considerable\u000a      comment in the media including feature articles in the Independent\u000a      and the Daily Mail [b] and\u000a      coverage in the Telegraph, The Times and the Huffington\u000a        Post [c] and many more national and\u000a      regional outlets.\u000a    Beider's research and the report continued to generate press\u000a      coverage and stimulate debate\u000a      beyond the initial launch event. For example, on the BBC Today\u000a      programme (4 January 2012),\u000a      Mark Easton, the BBC Home Affairs Editor, spoke about the need to heed the\u000a      findings from the\u000a      report in the context of discussion of race relations. Similarly, an\u000a      article in the Guardian on 19 April\u000a      2012 used the report to explore race, housing and a changing society. The\u000a      debate was extended\u000a      through social media, where it has been significantly commented upon and\u000a      shared. Over 1000\u000a      Tweets were sent about the report including comments from Phillip Blond\u000a      (Respublica think tank\u000a      and influential conservative thinker), Steve Hilton (formerly strategic\u000a      advisor to Prime Minister\u000a      Cameron) and Quentin Letts (Conservative journalist for the Daily Mail).\u000a      The report continues to\u000a      stimulate debate nearly two years after publication amongst politicians,\u000a      journalists, activists,\u000a      housing professionals, social workers, political commentators and the\u000a      general public.\u000a    The contribution of the report and the underpinning research was\u000a      highlighted in a confidential\u000a      independent evaluation in 2012 for JRF. This found that it is \"...the\u000a        single most commonly\u000a        referenced report ... One reason that this report may have been\u000a        memorable and resonant with\u000a        journalists is that it confounds usual expectations that white-working\u000a        class communities, rather\u000a        than ethnic minority groups, suffer from social exclusion. The report\u000a        was considered to be\u000a        surprising, challenged assumptions, and was clearly of great interest to\u000a        a wide range of reporters\u000a        and broadcasters ...\" [d].\u000a    Impact on public policy\u000a      Policy debate has been stimulated and informed by research evidence of\u000a      disconnection and\u000a      isolation in white working class communities. Beider has been\u000a      being requested to deliver\u000a      workshops and private briefings on the findings to politicians, policy\u000a      makers, funders and think\u000a      tanks. For example, Beider delivered a `teach in' to more than 20\u000a      JRF Senior Managers on 20\u000a      June 2012 to discuss the policy implications of his research. This group\u000a      is responsible for framing\u000a      strategy for JRF and for peer-reviewing research proposals. Bana Gora,\u000a      Programme Manager at\u000a      JRF stated \"...the event had provoked new thinking within JRF staff and\u000a      stimulated debate within\u000a      the organisation\". She went on to say \"... the research had an influence\u000a      on the Foundation's\u000a      Poverty and Ethnicity programme (budget &#163;1.3 million 2011-2015) and the\u000a      Westminster briefing in\u000a      2012\" [e]. The latter was organised by JRF, the Runnymede Trust and the\u000a      All Party Parliamentary\u000a      Group on Immigration on 5 July 2012.This reached across MPs and think\u000a      tanks from all parties to\u000a      discuss practical implications of the research. Attendees included MPs who\u000a      led on equalities and\u000a      cohesion portfolios as well as staff from think tanks such as British\u000a        Futures and the Equality\u000a        Development Foundation.\u000a    Beider was subsequently invited by Kate Green MP (Stretford and\u000a      Urmston\/Shadow Minister of\u000a      State for Equalities) to discuss the implications of this research at a\u000a      local political level [f]. She\u000a      organised a workshop with community activists in her constituency\u000a      specifically to share findings\u000a      and develop new ways to connect with low-income, white communities. This\u000a      took place on 14\u000a      September 2012 with more than 50 people attending including residents,\u000a      activists and local\u000a      stakeholders. As a result, Green has bid with Beider to the JRF\u000a      for funding to look at ways to\u000a      engage disenfranchised white working class communities. On the basis of\u000a      the research, Green is\u000a      also using new ways to engage with white working class residents in her\u000a      constituency and\u000a      improving their political representation.\u000a    Following the July 2012 Westminster briefing, Beider was invited\u000a      by Chris Williamson MP (Derby\u000a      North\/former Shadow Minister for Communities and Local Government) to\u000a      draft the Cohesion and\u000a      Integration consultation report that is being used to shape Labour Party\u000a      policy in the run up to the\u000a      2015 General Election. The document, Citizenship, Cohesion and\u000a        Integration, which names Beider\u000a      as a co-author, was published in December 2012. It was made available to\u000a      all Labour Party MPs,\u000a      their staff and Labour councillors across the UK prior to being published\u000a      on the YourBritain Labour\u000a      Party website [g]. This has been discussed at five regional consultation\u000a      meetings in 2013 attended\u000a      by over 150 political activists. The document is currently with the Leader\u000a      of the Labour Party for\u000a      further elaboration prior to incorporation in the manifesto.\u000a    Almost two years after the launch of the JRF report, Beider's\u000a      research continues to inform and\u000a      stimulate political debate. For example, it was cited in a House of\u000a      Commons briefing on housing\u000a      entitlements and EU migrants discussed in mid-2013 [h].\u000a    Impact on practitioners and professional services\u000a      The report challenges conventional wisdom and generates debate among\u000a      professionals. For\u000a      example, the report is available on the website of the British Association\u000a      of Social Workers (BASW)\u000a      [i]. The BASW is the largest professional association for social work in\u000a      the UK and promotes the\u000a      best possible social work services for all people who may need them,\u000a      while also securing the well-\u000a      being of social workers. Similarly, Beider published an article on\u000a      the 8 June 2012 in Inside Housing\u000a      based on his research, which is evidence of an on-going debate among\u000a      housing professionals [j].\u000a      Inside Housing is the leading weekly magazine for housing\u000a      professionals in the UK. It has a weekly\u000a      circulation of 25,512 with a total readership estimated to be more than\u000a      80,000.\u000a    The research has stimulated debate and extended its reach\u000a      internationally. Beider has been\u000a      regularly invited to speak about his research at practitioner-led events\u000a      in the United States. For\u000a      example, Beider was invited to speak at a practitioners' seminar\u000a      convened by the University of\u000a      Illinois in Chicago (UIC) on 24 January 2013 [k]. This was attended by 25\u000a      people including the\u000a      Executive Directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago (a grant-making\u000a      foundation whose goal is to\u000a      increase opportunities for less advantaged people and communities in the\u000a      metropolitan area) and\u000a      the Wieboldt Foundation (funder of activities that empower local\u000a      neighborhoods), and a\u000a      representative of Erie House (Chicago-based organization that works to\u000a      strengthen low-income,\u000a      primarily Latino, families through skill-building, access to critical\u000a      resources, advocacy and\u000a      collaborative action).\u000a    Beider's research was the basis of an international policy\u000a      workshop convened on 29-31 July 2013\u000a      in New York City [l]. The workshop included participants drawn from\u000a      Citizens Housing and\u000a      Planning Council (a not-for-profit organisation established in 1937\u000a      offering practical solutions to\u000a      people in New York who are in housing need and disadvantaged), JRF and the\u000a      Open Society\u000a      Foundation. Beider's research has also influenced the\u000a      establishment of an international project on\u000a      the views of majority communities funded by the Open Society Foundation.\u000a      The impact of the\u000a      research in the United States shows the considerable reach of a UK-based\u000a      project and its\u000a      applicability in different contexts where the majority population may feel\u000a      disenfranchised.\u000a    Conclusion\u000a      Beider`s research has had impact by being cited in public and\u000a      parliamentary debate among\u000a      stakeholders and through discussion in social, national and international\u000a      press and media. In\u000a      addition, the research has influenced the direction of funding\u000a      priorities\/programmes of major grant\u000a      awarding bodies and charities.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study is underpinned by the first qualitative research study of\u000a      national significance into\u000a      the views of white working class communities on community cohesion.

Professor\u000a      Richard Farnell's research started in 1992 and continued until his\u000a      retirement in 2011. During that\u000a      period Farnell's interest was in the role of faith communities in social\u000a      exclusion, which framed the\u000a      themes on disconnection and disadvantage underpinning this case study [1].\u000a      David Jarvis (UoA\u000a      19) joined the group in 2004 and continues Farnell's research on faith\u000a      communities [2].\u000a      Throughout the period, the group worked on commissioned and funded\u000a      research which has\u000a      produced influential reports in addition to research outputs. For example,\u000a      Farnell was supported by\u000a      the Church Urban Fund, and considered the role of faith in supporting\u000a      cohesion and renewal [3].\u000a      Similarly, the research group produced a report for the Local Government\u000a      Association (LGA) that\u000a      considered the impact of immigration on public services [4].\u000a    Professor Harris Beider joined the group in 2008 and his research\u000a      continues the focus on the\u000a      views of different groups in building community cohesion. His critical\u000a      research perspectives on\u000a      white working-class views of neighbourhoods, cohesion and change followed\u000a      the successful ESRC\u000a      Seminar Series on Community Cohesion: Retrospective and Prospective\u000a      [i], which brought\u000a      together academics, policy makers and activists to identify potential\u000a      solutions to improve\u000a      community cohesion. Between 2009 and 2011, Beider was then funded\u000a      by the Joseph Rowntree\u000a      Foundation [ii] (JRF) to explore the perspectives of white working class\u000a      communities on community\u000a      cohesion and neighbourhood change. The JRF-funded research project found\u000a      that, in contrast to\u000a      many studies on visible minority groups, white working class communities\u000a      had not been the subject\u000a      of extensive research or debate since the emergence of the community\u000a      cohesion concept. His\u000a      research found that communities were disconnected from policy makers.\u000a      White working class\u000a      communities perceived themselves to be the `last in line' when trying to\u000a      get the attention of local\u000a      government. Surprisingly, there was little support for the `far right'\u000a      amongst those interviewed,\u000a      however there was interest in developing grassroots responses to build\u000a      greater understanding\u000a      between different groups. This project and its unexpected findings helped\u000a      to shape the current\u000a      research direction and academic outputs for Beider [5, 6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24999","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Unemployment Insurance Project, of which the underpinning research\u000a      described above was a significant component, made valuable contributions\u000a      to the process of China modernising its social security system. In\u000a      particular, the research report recommended a programme of\u000a      capacity-building at local government level combined with greater\u000a      investment in technology and Management Information Systems. These\u000a      recommendations were implemented by the UIP, resulting in improved UI\u000a      services for the unemployed populations in six pilot cities across two of\u000a      China's largest provinces.\u000a    From 1986, but particularly from 1997, central government unemployment\u000a      policies in China had focused on assisting the urban registered unemployed\u000a      and so-called `laid-off employees' through unemployment insurance,\u000a      re-employment service centres and employment (or re-employment) services\u000a      such as training and job-search assistance.\u000a    Drawing on the UK's experience of social security reform, the DfID\u000a      project evaluated these programmes and outlined ways in which they might\u000a      be improved. The research conducted by Duckett and her colleagues fed into\u000a      new policies and models for unemployment insurance programmes in the six\u000a      pilot cities. These research findings were shared with Chinese central and\u000a      local government officials in May 2005, through a Policy Brief and through\u000a      workshops held in Shenyang and Chengdu in 2004, entitled `Patterns of\u000a        Disadvantage in the Labour Market and Long-term Unemployment'.\u000a    The research recommended that unemployment insurance (UI) departments\u000a      should have responsibility for collecting UI contributions, and UI work\u000a      should be tied into performance management frameworks and civil service\u000a      systems of performance monitoring. Overall performance should be improved\u000a      through the development of more effective performance management systems\u000a      together with recruitment and promotion measures through the reformed\u000a      civil service system.\u000a    The redesigned management and information systems currently in place for\u000a      unemployment insurance programmes and services which link unemployment\u000a      benefits, job search and training were a direct result of the DfID project\u000a      findings.\u000a    The research in the six pilot cities had highlighted the fact that local\u000a      capacity to gather data on unemployment was limited, and recommended that\u000a      assistance with capital investment in technology could facilitate an\u000a      improvement in these areas. Consequently, DfID worked to support greater\u000a      investment in IT and information systems and assisted in the creation of\u000a      more advanced management systems. The new systems meant that staff in\u000a      China's Ministry of Labour &amp; Social Security could link up information\u000a      on unemployment benefits with job searches and training in order to\u000a      provide a more targeted form of assistance to those in need.\u000a    Additionally, the research had identified that at local levels there was\u000a      a lack of capacity required to successfully implement unemployment\u000a      insurance programmes. In response to this finding, the wider DfID project\u000a      provided capacity development assistance to local government agencies in\u000a      order to enhance their ability to identify and support those in need of\u000a      assistance.\u000a    The improvements to unemployment insurance and employment service systems\u000a      introduced in pilot cities are now directly benefiting the unemployed\u000a      people of Sichuan and Liaoning and improving the skills of the local\u000a      staff. Thanks to improvements in capacity, IT and MIS in local\u000a      departments, these provinces are now better able to collect UI\u000a      contributions and data on those unemployed, ensuring a greater equality of\u000a      access and service provision.\u000a    The research impact has the potential to benefit a vast number of people.\u000a      When the project was completed, the Chinese Government reported that the\u000a      UI programmes had already benefitted 25,000 people. And the\u000a      newly-established systems continue to deliver benefits directly in the\u000a      pilot cities beyond the end of the project and have also influenced UI\u000a      system reforms adopted in other localities in the following years. The\u000a      Director General of the Institute of International Labour and Social\u000a      Security within the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social\u000a      Security commented in 2013 that the research programme had benefitted\u000a      significant numbers of unemployed people well beyond 2008 and continued to\u000a      have a great deal of impact through the influence of the pilots spreading\u000a      to other parts of China.\u000a    Because of the Ministry's reform scheme in the area of unemployment\u000a      insurance, the British Council believes that this project continues to\u000a      influence and benefit the people in China and that it will do so well into\u000a      the future. As noted above, these conclusions have been echoed by the\u000a      Director General of the Institute of International Labour and Social\u000a      Security within the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social\u000a      Security, who has been involved with the UIP since its inception.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Baseline research undertaken by University of Glasgow staff as part of\u000a      the Sino-British Unemployment Insurance Project (UIP) improved\u000a      unemployment insurance and employment service systems in six Chinese\u000a      cities in the Liaoning and Sichuan provinces, directly benefitting a\u000a      reported 25,000 recipients.

During the period of the\u000a      research Duckett was a Senior Lecturer in Politics at the University of\u000a      Glasgow, later being appointed Professor of Chinese and Comparative\u000a      Politics in 2008. The research was collaborative in nature and involved\u000a      another UK-based academic (Athar Hussain, London School of Economics) as\u000a      well as input from Chinese Government researchers (Ge Yanfeng, Development\u000a      Research Centre; Mo Rong, Ministry of Labour &amp; Social Security).\u000a      Duckett was invited to join the project because of specific expertise\u000a      built up from her earlier research undertaken at the University of Glasgow\u000a      on China's urban local government, generally (1; 2) and its urban social\u000a      welfare, in particular (3; 4).\u000a    The research undertaken by Duckett and her colleagues for the DfID\u000a      project comprised a baseline study (5) of local unemployment and\u000a      reemployment policies and programmes across six `pilot' cities (Shenyang,\u000a      Anshan, Benxi, Chengdu, Mianyang, Leshan) in two provinces (Liaoning and\u000a      Sichuan). The study involved fieldwork, including interviews with local\u000a      government officials in urban Labour Departments in the six pilot cities.\u000a      Duckett played a leading role and conducted the interviews herself (in\u000a      Chinese, which she speaks fluently). The participation of Chinese\u000a      officials meant that the researchers enjoyed a level of access not often\u000a      available and this led to a more developed and nuanced understanding of\u000a      the difficulties experienced by local government in providing unemployment\u000a      insurance effectively to target groups. Specifically, the study found that\u000a      local governments were better at tackling unemployment using more\u000a      traditional methods of governance, and that their use of new mechanisms\u000a      was less successful. Key insights from the research (subsequently\u000a      published in a high impact leading international refereed journal (6))\u000a      included:\u000a    \u000a      First, capacity to gather accurate employment data was limited,\u000a        meaning local and central governments did not have a good understanding\u000a        of the extent and nature of unemployment.\u000a      Second, the sustainability of supposedly mandatory unemployment\u000a        insurance schemes was threatened by poor capacity to enforce\u000a        participation.\u000a      Third, central state lacked the capacity to ensure local governments\u000a        implemented policies effectively, resulting in a shortage of funds to\u000a        deliver effective unemployment insurance. Provision was made for only a\u000a        narrow segment of the unemployed and employment services were of poor\u000a        quality.\u000a    \u000a    These findings directly fed into the project design. Specifically, one of\u000a      the recommendations of the baseline research (conducted in\u000a      August-September 2002; reported in October 2002) called for the project to\u000a      assist with the development of Management Information Systems (MIS) and\u000a      capital investment in technology. This intervention was intended to help\u000a      government departments administering UI to collect premiums contributions\u000a      and share UI-relevant information. The study also recommended that the UIP\u000a      use its IT systems to enable better data collection, improving\u000a      understanding of equal access issues.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27259","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research has informed three main pathways to impact :\u000a      the promotion of a major\u000a      public debate; informing parliamentary reform and the promotion of public\u000a      engagement; the\u000a      delivery of a major impact on parliamentary outreach both nationally and\u000a      internationally.\u000a    The Promotion of a Major Public Debate\u000a    In a period in which defending politics &#8212; and therefore politicians &#8212; is\u000a      a highly unfashionable\u000a      endeavour, the work of Hay and Flinders has promoted wider public\u000a      engagement through, for\u000a      example, the written and broadcast media: Flinders' Defending Politics\u000a      was the subject of a BBC\u000a      Television BOOKtalk programme and both Hay and Flinders have taken\u000a      their arguments to a wider\u000a      audience through invitations to literary and book festivals: Hay was\u000a      invited to the Gothenburg\u000a      literary festival while Flinders spoke at the Holland Park literary\u000a      festival with the Speaker of the\u000a      House of Commons, John Bercow, discussing why politics still matters in\u000a      the century of\u000a      'disaffected democrats' and political disillusionment. Flinders also spoke\u000a      at literary festivals in\u000a      Edinburgh and Cheltenham. In addition, ESRC-funded research involving Hay\u000a      informed an event in\u000a      the Houses of Parliament with the Hansard Society that presented the Audit\u000a      of Political\u000a      Engagement 9, Part 1: Media and Politics on which Hay advised. In June\u000a      2012, Hay working with\u000a      the Hansard Society used data arising from ESRC-funded research to\u000a      underpin a submission of\u000a      evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into Press Standards that clearly\u000a      demonstrated the negative\u000a      impact of tabloid readership on attitudes towards politics among citizens.\u000a      This evidence fed into\u000a      broader campaigning by Lord Puttnam who, referring directly to the\u000a      evidence presented by Hay\u000a      with the Hansard Society to the Leveson Inquiry, commented that: `I\u000a      believe our developing\u000a      concept of a duty of care should be extended to \"a care for our shared but\u000a      fragile democratic\u000a      values\". After all, the absence of a duty of care within many professions\u000a      can amount to accusations\u000a      of negligence and, that being the case, are we really comfortable with the\u000a      thought that we are\u000a      being, in effect, negligent in regard to the long term health of our own\u000a      democracies and the values\u000a      that underpin them? For those that remain in doubt the clearest possible\u000a      case is made out in the\u000a      Hansard Society's recently published Audit of Political Engagement 9, Part\u000a      2: Media and Politics'\u000a      [S1].\u000a    Further evidence that this strand of engaged scholarship has influenced\u000a      political and public\u000a      debates came in May 2010 when the Leader of the House of Commons, Sir\u000a      George Young, cited\u000a      Flinders' research and writing in his inaugural speech and noted `In a\u000a        recent speech \"A Defence\u000a        of Politics\" &#8212; a title which has a famous lineage, leading back ....\u000a        through Tony Wright and\u000a        originating, of course, with Bernard Crick &#8212; the Professor of Politics\u000a        at the University of\u000a        Sheffield, Matthew Flinders, said that, \"the public hankers after a more\u000a        optimistic, balanced\u000a        and informed account of politics\". I agree'. [S2].\u000a    The reach and significance of the debate was intensified during the\u000a      Autumn of 2011 as a result of\u000a      Flinders' three-part series &#8212; In Defence of Politics &#8212; on BBC\u000a      Radio 4 that attracted a listening\u000a      audience in excess of 1.7 million [S3]. Referring to Flinders'\u000a      research and a meeting with him at\u000a      the BBC, Alistair Campbell wrote on his blog that it is: `heartening to\u000a      find an academic willing to put\u000a      his head above the parapet and swim against the tide of negativity that\u000a      flows from the building in\u000a      which we sat'. Hay and Flinders continue to use their research as the\u000a      basis for practitioner and\u000a      public interventions. Flinders' research and writing also formed the basis\u000a      of invited submissions of\u000a      evidence to, inter alia, the Committee on Standards in Public\u000a      Life, the Independent Parliamentary\u000a      Standards Authority [S4], the Lords Committee on the Constitution [S5] and\u000a      the Political and\u000a      Constitutional Reform Select Committee. Contributions have been made by\u000a      Flinders to a vast\u000a      range of public events. Highlights include a presentation `Defending\u000a      Politics' to the Royal Society of\u000a      Arts, the video of which has attracted more than 5300 Youtube views and\u000a      more than 300\u000a      participants in on-line debates (as of October 2013). During a plenary\u000a      event at the PSA annual\u000a      conference in Belfast in April 2012 the Speaker of the House of Commons,\u000a      John Bercow, praised\u000a      Flinders' contribution to promoting public engagement and the public\u000a      understanding of politics [S6]\u000a      and, later that year, Flinders received the Communicator of the Year\u000a      award from the Political\u000a      Studies Association of the UK.\u000a    Parliamentary Reform and Public Engagement\u000a    Since publication in 2002 of his article `Shifting the Balance?\u000a      Parliament, the Executive and the\u000a      British Constitution' [winner of the Harrison Prize for Best Article in Political\u000a        Studies] Flinders has\u000a      maintained an active relationship with a range of select committees and\u000a      more recently with the\u000a      Liaison Committee (the committee made up of the chairs of all the select\u000a      committees). In 2012\u000a      Flinders was invited to contribute to the Liaison Committee's review of\u000a      `the effectiveness,\u000a      resources and powers of select committees' and used this opportunity to\u000a      promote a specific\u000a      argument about the need for select committees to reach out more broadly\u000a      and play a more\u000a      vigorous role in promoting the public understanding and accessibility of\u000a      politics. He was the only\u000a      witness to make such an argument and pressed his case whilst giving oral\u000a      evidence to the full\u000a      committee on 23 February 2012. In November 2012 the Committee published\u000a      its final report [S7]\u000a      and drew from Flinders' arguments that emphasised the dual role of\u000a      committees: first, to hold the\u000a      executive to account; and, secondly, to promote public understanding of\u000a      politics. This then formed\u000a      the basis for a new `core task' for all select committees:\u000a    `PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT &#8212; Task 10: To assist the House of Commons in better\u000a        engaging with\u000a        the public by ensuring that the work of the committee is accessible to\u000a        the public' (HC 697,\u000a        paras. 15-17).\u000a    In attesting to Flinders' impact on public engagement by select\u000a      committees, the Senior Policy\u000a      Analyst to the House of Lords Constitution Committee has stated that\u000a      Flinders' `impact is\u000a        characterised as much by its breadth as by its depth ... Flinders\u000a        contribution to the work of\u000a        parliamentary select committees extends well beyond the Constitution\u000a        Committee. He has\u000a        made a number of invited submissions, both oral and written, to all the\u000a        key House of\u000a        Commons committees ...The fact that Prof. Flinders was invited to give\u000a        oral evidence to the\u000a        Commons Liaison Committee is particularly indicative of the high regard\u000a        with which he is\u000a        held' [S8]. Flinders also authored the guidance document for social\u000a      scientists who want to engage\u000a      with Parliament and Select Committees that now forms part of the ESRC\u000a        `Impact Toolkit' [S9] and\u000a      that has also been adopted by a range of other professional associations\u000a      (e.g. the Campaign for\u000a      Science and Engineering).\u000a    Impacts on parliamentary outreach\u000a    The final layer of this case study extends beyond the University of\u000a      Sheffield to deliver impact on\u000a      the outreach and educational activities of parliaments in the UK and\u000a      internationally. This impact\u000a      links back to work by Hay and Flinders' by encouraging students of\u000a      politics to directly engage both\u000a      with practitioners and with modes of parliamentary governance.\u000a    In 2012, after twelve months of negotiation and co-operation with the\u000a      Speakers of both the House\u000a      of Commons and the House of Lords, the University of Sheffield launched\u000a      the first ever\u000a      undergraduate module to be formally accredited and co-taught by the\u000a        Houses of Parliament.\u000a      Seminars are led by a combination of senior parliamentary staff and former\u000a      or retired MPs and\u000a      ministers. Instead of a standard essay, students are required to produce a\u000a      `memorandum of\u000a      evidence' for a hypothetical select committee inquiry. The module has been\u000a      highly successful. For\u000a      example, eight students have received `parliamentary studies' scholarships\u000a      from the Higher\u000a      Education Academy. In November 2012 the Speaker of the House of Commons\u000a      announced his\u000a      decision to extend this Sheffield-led initiative across the UK and, in\u000a      January 2013, fourteen other\u000a      universities were selected to offer the module for the 2013-14 academic\u000a      year. The Sheffield-based\u000a      pilot has had a major impact on reinvigorating the study of Parliament\u000a      across the UK. The Head of\u000a      Public Information and Outreach at the Houses of Parliament notes the\u000a      impact on parliamentary\u000a      outreach as: `the module provides a positive opportunity for\u000a        parliamentary staff to travel\u000a        across the UK to promote the study of parliament ...Parliamentary staff\u000a        are therefore\u000a        engaging with academics in new ways' [S10]. This impact is now\u000a      extending internationally with\u000a      the module being delivered by: the University of Hong Kong and the\u000a      Legislative Council of Hong\u000a      Kong; the University of Sydney and the Parliament of New South Wales; and\u000a      between Murdoch\u000a      University in Perth and the Parliament of Western Australia. Recognition\u000a      occurred in 2013 at the\u000a      ESRC's national `Celebrating Impact' competition at which Flinders won\u000a        a prize in the category\u000a        `Impact Champion'.\u000a    To conclude, the impact of this research is a set of demonstrable\u000a        reforms, initiatives and\u000a        innovations that range from policy-specific or impacts on parliamentary\u000a        outreach to far\u000a        broader `public engagement' and `relevance-based' achievements. Each\u000a      can be traced back\u000a      to underpinning research by Flinders and Hay. This impact demonstrates a\u000a      contemporary\u000a      manifestation of the long-standing commitment of the Department of\u000a      Politics at the University of\u000a      Sheffield to engaged scholarship. This distinctive research and associated\u000a      high-level and extensive\u000a      impact has effectively bridged politics as theory and politics as\u000a        practice at a number of levels. On\u000a      the basis of the success of his earlier programme, Flinders was\u000a      commissioned in May 2013 by\u000a      BBC Radio 4 to write and present a second programme on the theme of\u000a      political literacy and\u000a      understanding focusing on the impact of political comedy and satire on\u000a      young people. This project\u000a      &#8212; Joking Apart? &#8212; involves interviews with leading writers,\u000a      comedians, politicians and\u000a      commentators, including in the United States, Italy, Australia and the UK,\u000a      investigating the role of\u000a      satire and comedy as a political medium.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Award-winning and ESRC-funded research by Professor Matthew Flinders and\u000a      Professor Colin\u000a      Hay into political participation and public engagement has led not only to\u000a      direct and on-going\u000a        changes within the political system (notably in relation to the\u000a      operation and governance of\u000a      parliamentary select committees) but has also delivered wider impact\u000a      through the promotion of a\u000a      major public debate &#8212; embracing several million people within and beyond\u000a      the UK &#8212; concerning the\u000a      need to understand and defend the essence of democratic politics.\u000a      Additional impact has\u000a      been delivered on parliamentary outreach both in the UK and\u000a        internationally through the\u000a      development with the Houses of Parliament of partnership-based teaching of\u000a      politics.

While examining the same empirical material and data from\u000a      different angles and\u000a      positions, their research shares a clear focus on the concept of\u000a      depoliticisation, the management of\u000a      public expectations regarding democratic politics and, critically, the\u000a      need for academics to play a\u000a      role in promoting the public understanding of politics and enhanced\u000a        engagement by citizens\u000a        with democratic politics.\u000a    Research by Flinders and Hay has not only offered new analytical\u000a      narratives for what may be\u000a      fuelling changing social attitudes (i.e. Hay's influential work on `why\u000a        we hate politics'), but it has\u000a      also challenged (both academically and publicly) dominant assumptions\u000a      about what politics\u000a      can\/should deliver (i.e. Flinders' Defending Politics). Hay's\u000a      award-winning work (including the\u000a      PSA's Richard Rose prize in 2009) has explored both the\u000a      demand-side and supply-side dynamics\u000a      of political relationships, which has produced new insights into the role\u000a      of the tabloid media in\u000a      generating cynicism about politics. Hay has also provided a new\u000a      understanding of external sources\u000a      of depoliticisation, such as the effects of globalisation [R1]. Subsequent\u000a      ESRC-funded research\u000a      (with Gerry Stoker and the Hansard Society) further developed and deepened\u000a      this work through\u000a      innovative combinations of survey and focus group techniques that\u000a      delivered new insights into the\u000a      relationship between the public and the media regarding political\u000a      processes, institutions and\u000a      politicians [R2].\u000a    Flinders has examined political disengagement and political apathy\u000a      reflected in, for example, his\u000a      use of Lijphartian political analysis to trace and understand the changing\u000a      nature of British politics\u000a      [R3, R4], the deployment of principal-agent theory and historical\u000a      institutionalism in relation to\u000a      British governance (Walking Without Order, OUP 2009), his\u000a      reconceptualisation of the\u000a      parliamentary decline thesis (with Alex Kelso, winner of the prize for\u000a        best article in the British\u000a          Journal of Politics and International Relations, 2011 [R5];\u000a      and, most recently, his co-authored\u000a      work on the theory of moral panics and the concept of `folk devils' in\u000a      relation to contemporary\u000a      political phenomena (Contemporary Politics 2012, with response\u000a      pieces from Stoker, Alastair\u000a      Campbell and others). In Defending Politics (OUP, 2012) [R6]\u000a      Flinders pulled-together these\u000a      strands of scholarship to challenge prevailing popular anti-political\u000a      opinion and to develop an\u000a      argument in favour of `engaged scholarship'. This latter theme was\u000a      subsequently developed when\u000a      Flinders' arguments on `the tyranny of relevance' and `the art of\u000a      translation' formed the focus of a\u000a      special edition of Political Studies Review, including\u000a      contributions from the former and current\u000a      editor of the American Political Science Review.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27264","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This policy-relevant research generated a range of demonstrable impacts\u000d\u000a      in terms of both reach and significance. From 2009 onwards the impact of\u000d\u000a      the global financial crisis increased the political salience of this\u000d\u000a      research as governments &#8212; within and beyond the UK &#8212; looked for new ways\u000d\u000a      of reducing bureaucratic waste and getting value for money. At the 2010\u000d\u000a      General Election all three of the main political parties included a\u000d\u000a      commitment to reduce and reform the sphere of delegated governance and, as\u000d\u000a      outlined below, Flinders' research was to prove highly influential in\u000d\u000a      setting out an evidence-based reform agenda. In supporting this claim, the\u000d\u000a      senior civil servant responsible for public bodies' reform in the Cabinet\u000d\u000a      Office has acknowledged that research by Flinders `helped to define\u000d\u000a        the climate in which reform of public bodies became inevitable' and\u000d\u000a      that his research `continues to play a decisive role in shaping the\u000d\u000a        future of the Government's policy on public bodies'. [see S1 below].\u000d\u000a      The Policy Analyst to the House of Lords Committee on the Constitution,\u000d\u000a      has similarly written that `Prof. Flinders' impact on the committee's\u000d\u000a        inquiries has gone beyond the mere elucidation of subject matter &#8212; his\u000d\u000a        submissions have on occasion shaped the conclusions and even the\u000d\u000a        structures of the committee's own reports.'[S2].\u000d\u000a    A direct research-application-impact relationship can be demonstrated\u000d\u000a      through a range of channels. The most influential example was instigated\u000d\u000a      by Flinders' collaboration with the Institute for Government and the\u000d\u000a      production of a report &#8212; Read Before Burning [S3] &#8212; in July 2010,\u000d\u000a      which presented the main research findings (listed in Section 2 above) and\u000d\u000a      argued in favour of wide-ranging review and reform. This report was the\u000d\u000a      focus of a large number of media reports and subsequently formed the main\u000d\u000a      reference point for the Public Administration Select Committee's Smaller\u000a        Government: Shrinking the Quango State [S4] report of January 2011.\u000d\u000a      Flinders' research &#8212; either directly through his memorandum of\u000d\u000a      evidence to the inquiry, or indirectly through his involvement\u000d\u000a      with the Institute for Government's report &#8212; was referenced seventeen\u000d\u000a      times in the select committee's final report [S4] and led to specific\u000d\u000a      recommendations that were subsequently accepted in the Government's formal\u000d\u000a      response (paragraph 52) in March 2011. The Chairman of the House of\u000d\u000a      Commons Public Administration Select Committee, has written of `the\u000d\u000a        very clear and significant impact that Matthew Flinders has achieved in\u000d\u000a        recent years... If asked for a clear and demonstrable example of the\u000d\u000a      actual impact of his contribution I would point you to\u000d\u000a        the Public Administration Select Committee's report &#8212; Smaller\u000d\u000a        Government: Shrinking the Quango State &#8212; of January 2011...the influence\u000d\u000a        of Prof. Flinders' research and writing is obvious within the text of\u000d\u000a        the final report. Indeed, many of the actual recommendations made by the\u000d\u000a        committee are actually explicitly linked to either his written\u000d\u000a        submission of evidence or to points he made when appearing in front of\u000d\u000a        the committee...It is refreshing to see an academic that is so engaged\u000d\u000a        and visible within Whitehall and Westminster [emphasis in the\u000d\u000a      original]' [S5].\u000d\u000a    Beyond the direct example given above, the impact of Flinders' research\u000d\u000a      findings were much wider, as evidenced by the fact that the UK Parliament\u000d\u000a      website returns over one-hundred references to Flinders' `quango-related'\u000d\u000a      research in either select committee reports or House of Commons Research\u000d\u000a      Papers (January 2008 - June 2013). Flinders made a number of\u000d\u000a      research-based recommendations that he fed into policy discussions either\u000d\u000a      through evidence to parliamentary inquiries (see, for example, House of\u000d\u000a      Commons Treasury Select Committee [S6], House of Commons Public\u000d\u000a      Administration Committee [S4], House of Commons Liaison Committee [S7],\u000d\u000a      House of Lords Committee on the Constitution [S8] and through media work\u000d\u000a      (see. for example, The Times 11 December 2009, The Guardian\u000d\u000a      31 March 2010, Yorkshire Post, 5 November 2010), practitioner\u000d\u000a      magazines (see, for example, Holyrood, October 2010; Public\u000d\u000a        Service Magazine, February 2012; The House, May 2012) or\u000d\u000a      through think-tank working papers between 2008 and 2010 (four practitioner\u000d\u000a      papers were published by the Institute for Government).\u000d\u000a    Flinders' recommendations included the need to undertake a fundamental\u000d\u000a      review of all public bodies, the need to institute mechanisms for\u000d\u000a      cross-government training and support in relation to sponsorship, the need\u000d\u000a      to enhance the capacity of the Cabinet Office vis-&#224;-vis public\u000d\u000a      bodies, the recommendation to establish a Centre of Excellence for Public\u000d\u000a      Appointments in the Cabinet Office.\u000d\u000a    The on-going impact of this work was recognised in 2010 when Flinders was\u000d\u000a      invited to contribute to the official history of the Office of the\u000d\u000a      Commissioner for Public Appointments (OCPA) and when the Cabinet Secretary\u000d\u000a      and Head of the Civil Service, Sir Gus O'Donnell, used his speech at the\u000d\u000a      2011 OCPA Annual Conference to state `Whitehall needs more academics\u000d\u000a        like Professor Flinders...real research written in an accessible\u000d\u000a        language'. Later in 2011, Flinders was invited by the Foreign and\u000d\u000a      Commonwealth Office to contribute to its `Supporting Democracy Programme'\u000d\u000a      working with the government of Thailand to institute a transparent and\u000d\u000a      merit-based public appointments system. This involved meetings with\u000d\u000a      ministers, regulators and civil society representatives; a lecture to the\u000d\u000a      Senate of Thailand; and a subsequent delegation of Thai Senators and\u000d\u000a      officials visiting the UK to meet the Commissioner for Public Appointments\u000d\u000a      and to learn more about the regulation of public appointments in the UK.\u000d\u000a      As a result of this knowledge-exchange Thailand is now in the process of\u000d\u000a      implementing measures that draw from UK experience.\u000d\u000a    Flinders' research also contributed to and informed reforms by the\u000d\u000a      coalition government across the areas of research highlighted in section\u000d\u000a      2. These being: (i) the capacity of the Cabinet Office in relation to\u000d\u000a      agencies and public bodies was immediately increased after May 2010; (ii)\u000d\u000a      the annual document `Public Bodies' was re-issued using a more complete\u000d\u000a      and comprehensive methodology and typology; (iii) a new set of internal\u000d\u000a      control measures were introduced to tighten the relationship between\u000d\u000a      departments and arm's-length bodies; (iv) new procedures were put in place\u000d\u000a      to control the creation of new agencies, board and commissions; and (v)\u000d\u000a      the public appointments framework was fundamentally reviewed and reformed.\u000d\u000a    The outcome is a set of reforms that can be demonstrably traced back to a\u000d\u000a      core research foundation including: a fundamental review of all public\u000d\u000a      bodies which drew upon Flinders' initial analysis; a reform process that\u000d\u000a      sought to simplify the complex institutional landscape that Flinders had\u000d\u000a      mapped; the creation of a new and strengthened `Public Bodies Team' within\u000d\u000a      the Cabinet Office; the publication of Public Bodies 2012 that\u000d\u000a      includes a revised version of Flinders' `Russian Doll Model' representing\u000d\u000a      various degrees of delegation through which the `drift' of functions\u000d\u000a      across a `spectrum of autonomy' can be shown. Flinders' approach was:\u000d\u000a      promoted by the Institute for Government and referred to by the Cabinet\u000d\u000a      Office in its report on Public Bodies published in 2012 (p.70);\u000d\u000a      evident in the creation of a Sponsorship Network across Whitehall (to\u000d\u000a      which Flinders was invited to speak in January 2012 and October 2013); and\u000d\u000a      the creation of a new Centre for Excellence on Public Appointments within\u000d\u000a      the Cabinet Office. This research continues to develop momentum with\u000d\u000a      Flinders acting as a keynote speaker (alongside the Head of the Civil\u000d\u000a      Service) to outline the findings and implications of his on-going research\u000d\u000a      for agencies at the International Association of Agency Chief Executives\u000d\u000a      (Dublin, May 2013) and at the Annual Conference of the UK Association of\u000d\u000a      Chief Executives (London, June 2013). His research on public bodies reform\u000d\u000a      is now being developed in the Republic of Ireland in the form of a Public\u000d\u000a      Service Fellowship (held by Dr Muiris Macarthaigh) in the Irish\u000d\u000a      government's Department for Expenditure and Reform. Overall, the depth and\u000d\u000a      breadth of this impact led a senior civil servant from the Cabinet Office\u000d\u000a      to highlight that: `Underpinning Professor Flinders' work is his\u000d\u000a        impressive and atypical ability to adapt his research and modes of\u000d\u000a        communication to different audiences.

The\u000a      research has reached a wide array of inter-connected governmental and\u000a      non-governmental\u000a      communities, many acting as multipliers on one another. The depth of the\u000a      change of understanding\u000a      has been significant, with a consequently substantial shift in approaches\u000a      to governance.

The CCRA is the UK's first assessment of\u000a      potential climate change\u000a      impacts and is a statutory assessment laid before Parliament in January\u000a      2012. The CCRA reflects\u000a      on the implications for the UK of future migration linked to environmental\u000a      change if large overseas\u000a      areas were to be severely affected by climate change. The CCRA gives\u000a      direction to the National\u000a      Adaptation Programme laid before Parliament in 2013. The CCRA Evidence\u000a      report draws directly\u000a      from the MGEC report to note that if immigration to the UK is affected,\u000a      especially in the event of\u000a      `catastrophic' climate change rendering large overseas areas\u000a      uninhabitable, then the influx of new\u000a      immigrants might change the proportion and composition of ethnic groups in\u000a      Britain with\u000a      implications for UK demographics and for health needs (p. 189). The Department\u000a        for\u000a        International Development (DFID) Adaptation Team used the MGEC\u000a      framework related to\u000a      migration as a form of adaptation to environmental risk to change\u000a      awareness and reshape policy\u000a      agendas on the impact of cash transfers for poor people in vulnerable\u000a      environments (S1, p.5).\u000a      DFID used the report as the basis for a workshop (March 2012) in Ghana\u000a      with the Foresight team\u000a      and the National Development Planning Commission of Ghana to consider the\u000a      Report's\u000a      implications for the Government of Ghana and to assess approaches to\u000a      migration as an adaptation\u000a      strategy. The MGEC report's analytical framework was used to initiate\u000a      research in Ghana on the\u000a      impact of cash transfers.\u000a    European Union: EU-level approaches previously had a narrow\u000a      security focus with, for example,\u000a      the Commission's former High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Javier\u000a      Solana, delivering a paper\u000a      to the Council in March 2008 entitled Climate Change and International\u000a        Security focused on\u000a      `environmentally triggered additional migratory stress' (page 10) with\u000a      potential for exacerbation of\u000a      existing conflicts, creation of new conflicts (e.g. over resources),\u000a      triggering of border tensions and\u000a      scope for large-scale displacement. The MGEC report challenged this\u000a      `securitised' conception of\u000a      the issues. Geddes presented the MGEC findings to the Joint Research\u000a        Committee of the\u000a        European Commission (December 2011) and participated in a bilateral\u000a      meeting between the\u000a      Director General of the European Commission Home Affairs Unit, Mr\u000a      Stefano Manservisi, and\u000a      the UK Government's Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir John Beddington, in\u000a      which specific implications\u000a      of the report's findings for the EU were discussed, particularly migration\u000a      as an adaptation strategy.\u000a      Following this meeting and workshops with the Foresight team, in April\u000a      2013, the European\u000a        Commission produced a Staff Working Document (SWD) on Climate\u000a        Change, Environmental\u000a        Degradation, and Migration accompanying the EU Strategy on Adaptation to\u000a        Climate\u000a        Change (S2). The SWD referred extensively to the MGEC report\u000a      (on 19 occasions). For example,\u000a      on p.8, the SWD identified the change in awareness stimulated by the MGEC\u000a      report when noting\u000a      that: `Early analyses of the impact of climate change and migration were\u000a      based on an overly\u000a      deterministic understanding of the relationship between the risk of\u000a      environmental degradation\u000a      faced by populations and the likelihood that they would migrate. In\u000a      contrast, more recent research\u000a      such as the UK government's Foresight study has taken a more sophisticated\u000a      approach, paying\u000a      greater attention to both the adaptive capacity of persons in low income\u000a      countries, and the factors\u000a      behind decisions to migrate'. The SWD then referred directly by name (S2,\u000a      p.12) to a policy brief\u000a      prepared by Geddes that applied the MGEC report to 10 South Mediterranean\u000a      Partner Countries\u000a      and explored implications of environmental change for issues such as urban\u000a      governance,\u000a      vulnerability and `trapped populations'. Directly using Geddes' policy\u000a      brief, the SWD noted that\u000a      contrary to previous assumptions about potential mass migration and\u000a      displacement the `options for\u000a      longer-distance and international migration within the Southern\u000a      Mediterranean countries and\u000a      beyond are likely to be reduced by the effect of environmental change and\u000a      its interaction with other\u000a      migration drivers, in particular for the poorest groups in society.\u000a      Therefore, persons migrating may\u000a      not be the most vulnerable or the most affected by environmental change'\u000a      (p.12). Thus the\u000a      European Commission took forward MGEC findings that challenged simplistic\u000a      notions of mass\u000a      flight and developed a more sophisticated understanding of the policy\u000a      challenges. The SWD then\u000a      fed directly into the Commission's Communication of May 2013 on Maximising\u000a        the Development\u000a        Impact of Migration: The EU contribution for the UN High-level Dialogue\u000a        and next steps\u000a        towards broadening the development-migration nexus, p. 3 of which\u000a      referred explicitly to the\u000a      SWD to note a key MGEC conclusion that `climate change and environmental\u000a      degradation are\u000a      already exerting an increasing influence on migration and mobility, with\u000a      current evidence\u000a      suggesting that in the future most movements will occur either within or\u000a      between developing\u000a      countries'.\u000a    International organisations (UN system, World Bank): Geddes\u000a      presented the MGEC report to the\u000a      UN Inter-Agency meeting on International Migration at UN Headquarters in\u000a      February 2012. The\u000a      MGEC report has significantly influenced the United Nations High\u000a        Commissioner for Refugees\u000a        (UNHCR) thinking and work in seeking to place migration issues\u000a      higher on the international\u000a      agenda. For example, the Foresight project contributed to the launch of\u000a      the Nansen Initiative\u000a      (launched by the Swiss and German governments at the UNHCR's Executive\u000a      Committee on\u000a      October 2 2012) by preparing a report entitled The Nansen Initiative,\u000a        UNHCR and the Foresight\u000a        Report on MGEC. The Population Division of the United Nations\u000a        Department for Economic and\u000a        Social Affairs (UNDESA) has cited the report to support discussions\u000a      in the inter-agency Global\u000a      Migration Group. The MGEC report served as the basis for a discussion of\u000a      migration and\u000a      environmental change in the report of the United Nations Secretary-General\u000a      on International\u000a      Migration and Development prepared for the sixty-seventh session of the\u000a      General Assembly in\u000a      Autumn 2012. The Secretary-General's report made specific reference to the\u000a      MGEC report when it\u000a      noted that: `Environmental change is seldom the sole reason for people to\u000a      move, but is often one\u000a      of the reasons to migrate, alongside political, social, economic and\u000a      demographic factors' (S3, p.8).\u000a      The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) recognised that\u000a      the MGEC report\u000a      contributed to new and emerging understandings of linkages between\u000a      poverty, the environment,\u000a      and migration as well as building synergies between global processes such\u000a      as the Global Forum\u000a        for Migration and Development (GFMD) and the United Nations\u000a        Framework Convention on\u000a        Climate Change (UNFCCC) process (S1, p.2). The United Nations\u000a        Environment Programme\u000a        (UNEP) used the Report for the in-depth analysis to inform its own\u000a      regional study and to serve as\u000a      an important reference point (S1, p.2). Geddes co-authored a report\u000a      applying the MGEC report to\u000a      the World Bank's Europe and Central Asia region. The MGEC report\u000a      has contributed to debate,\u000a      policy and practice regarding regional migration issues, and has been used\u000a      to brief senior World\u000a      Bank policy makers and a wider audience. The World Bank are using the MGEC\u000a      report and policy\u000a      briefing paper co-authored by Geddes to set empirical background\u000a      conditions for policy at regional\u000a      and country level and to foster discussion within relevant sector units\u000a      within the World Bank, and in\u000a      turn with client countries. It is also using the MGEC report in the\u000a      development of its corporate\u000a      strategy and global advocacy (S1, p.2)\u000a    Public engagement: The MGEC report was covered extensively in the\u000a      national and international\u000a      media to reshape debate about links between migration and environmental\u000a      change. For example,\u000a      The Guardian newspaper had previously published articles such as\u000a      the following in 2008 that\u000a      noted potential for `mass migration arising from climate change with\u000a      climate change as one of the\u000a      major drivers of this phenomenon ... Europe must expect substantially\u000a      increased migratory\u000a      pressure' (cited in R4). Immediately following the launch of the MGEC\u000a      report, The Guardian\u000a      reported the issues very differently when noting that: `Hundreds of\u000a      millions of people may be\u000a      trapped in inhospitable environments as they attempt to flee from the\u000a      effects of global warming,\u000a      worsening the likely death toll from severe changes to the climate'. The\u000a      article referred directly to\u000a      Geddes, as follows: `Trying to stop migration from global warming may be\u000a      the wrong approach, the\u000a      scientists warned. Andrew Geddes, professor of politics at the University\u000a      of Sheffield, said:\u000a      \"Policies that just seek to prevent migration are risky.\" Instead,\u000a      governments should attempt to\u000a      anticipate movement and find ways to improve conditions, both in the\u000a      places people are likely to\u000a      move to, and those they are likely to move from' (S4). In addition, the\u000a      MGEC report and its key\u000a      findings were covered in articles in major international news outlets for\u000a      example by the New York\u000a          Times (S5), Reuters (S6), Financial\u000a          Times (S7), and BBC News (S8) website. The MGEC\u000a      report\u000a      also reshaped debate amongst NGOs about links between climate change and\u000a      migration. For\u000a      example, the report Communicating Climate and Migration by the UK\u000a        Climate Change and\u000a        Migration Coalition (S9) noted that: 'Several factors appear to have\u000a      brought it to public attention\u000a      over the past year, most notably the famine and drought in Somalia, the\u000a      Durban climate summit\u000a      and the UK Government Foresight report' (p.6).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Andrew Geddes' research on international migration has directly\u000a      impacted upon the\u000a      thinking of officials and the subsequent reshaping of policy at national\u000a      and international levels\u000a      concerning connections between environmental change and migration. Impact\u000a      has occurred in\u000a      several countries and at different governance levels. The result is that a\u000a        previously deterministic\u000a        policy debate about environmental change triggering mass flight is now\u000a        based on a\u000a        changed and far more sophisticated understanding of the evidence with\u000a        different\u000a        assumptions now informing policy development.

Sixth,\u000a      preparing policy briefs\u000a      taking forward MGEC findings for the European Commission (analysing 10\u000a      South Mediterranean\u000a      countries) and for the World Bank's Europe and Central Asia region.\u000a    Instead of starting from the impact of environmental change, Geddes'\u000a      research contribution begins\u000a      from impacts of existing migration to link environmental change to other\u000a      `drivers' of migration, such\u000a      as economic, social, political and demographic change. This\u000a      reconceptualises the debate by\u000a      showing that the effects of environmental change are more likely to occur\u000a      through interaction with\u000a      these other drivers. The direct implication is that environmental\u000a        change cannot be thought of\u000a        as a simple triggering factor leading to mass migration. This\u000a      conceptual framework\u000a      fundamentally rethinks the underlying nature of the issues in three key\u000a      ways that directly challenge\u000a      existing thinking:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aMovement towards and not away from risk. Migration is driven by\u000a        interaction between\u000a        economic, social, political, demographic and environmental factors.\u000a        Rather than simply\u000a        triggering mass flight, environmental change will interact with these\u000a        other migration drivers. The\u000a        result is that migration is likely to occur &#8212; much of it within states &#8212;\u000a        that is towards and not away\u000a        from risk. For example, this will take the form of migration to large\u000a        and growing urban centres in\u000a        which new migrants are then exposed to environmental risk and hazard\u000a        such as in informal\u000a        settlements in large cities located in low lying coastal areas.\u000a      \u000aTrapped populations. Rather than serving as a simple trigger\u000a        mechanism, environmental\u000a        change can reduce people's ability to migrate by eroding resources\u000a        (e.g., financial and social)\u000a        with the effect that millions of people are potentially trapped in areas\u000a        where they are exposed\u000a        to serious environmental risk, but lack the capacity to move.\u000a      \u000aMigration as adaptation and not as failure to adapt. The MGEC\u000a        report developed evidence\u000a        and analysis of how and with what effects planned migration that\u000a        anticipates slower onset\u000a        environmental change can reduce or offset the effects and impacts of\u000a        more problematic forced\u000a        migration or displacement.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27420","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"290291","Name":"Bahrain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Haynes and Bradley have exploited their research on religious soft power\u000d      to enhance the wider public understanding of the impact of religion in\u000d      politics and international relations.

Recognition of the impact of his national and international\u000d      research achievements was marked in February 2008 by the creation, under\u000d      his direction, of LMU's Centre for the Study of Religion, Conflict and\u000d      Cooperation (CSRCC).\u000d    Mentored by Professor Haynes, Dr Tamsin Bradley worked on the issue of\u000d      religious soft power between 2005 and September 2011, when she left LMU.\u000d      Bradley examined the role of religious soft power in the context of gender\u000d      relations in India, Rwanda and Sierra Leone.

Haynes and Bradley's\u000d      research addresses issues which extend beyond scholarly concerns, to\u000d      include vital policy and popular topics. These include highly\u000d      controversial issues such as the consequences of the West's intervention\u000d      in Afghanistan and Iraq and, in May 2013, the murder of a British soldier\u000d      in Woolwich, south-east London, allegedly by UK-based Islamist militants.\u000d      Such concerns focus on a wider issue: `Why does religion influence\u000d      politics and society and what happens when it does?' What is the\u000d      role of religious soft power in facilitating the social and political\u000d      influence of religion in societies and cultures around the world?\u000d    Haynes' research on `religious soft power' has been translated into at\u000d      least seven languages (Farsi, German, Japanese, Indonesian, Italian,\u000d      Spanish, and Turkish). Overall, since the mid-1990s, Haynes' numerous\u000d      appearances at public events, and contributions to blogs, YouTube videos\u000d      and podcasts, adding to a plethora of relevant research publications on\u000d      religious soft power &#8212; including 20 books, nearly 40 peer-reviewed journal\u000d      articles, more than 60 book chapters, and two specially-commissioned\u000d      working papers &#8212; have served significantly to disseminate and explain the\u000d      concept, theory and practice of `religious soft power' both nationally and\u000d      internationally.

His article\u000d      `Learning in Public: Connecting Politics Students with Practitioners in\u000d      \"the Edgeless University\"', in the Political Studies Association's\u000d      magazine Political Insight (2010), was particularly important in\u000d      this respect because of its wide circulation among both HE colleagues and\u000d      students.\u000d    Curtis' work with colleagues at the universities of Keele, Huddersfield\u000d      and Leeds in 2007-08 and Sheffield Hallam University in 2010, helped their\u000d      Politics departments develop new or revise existing placement learning\u000d      schemes better to suit their students' needs and curricular requirements.\u000d      The impact was highly noticeable at Huddersfield, where the relevant\u000d      placement tutor significantly revised the existing approach to placement\u000d      learning by reducing the length of placements from ten to three weeks and\u000d      by encouraging his students to blog about their experiences on the HEI's\u000d      virtual learning environment. This made the placement experience much more\u000d      popular with students and improved significantly their engagement with the\u000d      process. Lecturers at Leeds, Keele and Sheffield Hallam also altered their\u000d      placements, or their plans to introduce placement learning, as a result of\u000d      the application of the results of Curtis's research. Lecturers at Leeds\u000d      were primarily concerned about matters of social inclusion, as they saw\u000d      the value of short placements in terms of providing experiential learning\u000d      opportunities for students with part-time jobs and family commitments, as\u000d      had been demonstrated by Curtis's research and publications.\u000d    Curtis's publications and conference papers have also had an impact at\u000d      other HEIs, such as Salford and UEA. One of these publications (Curtis et\u000d      al. 2009b), published in a PSA journal with wide readership, influenced\u000d      how placement learning was introduced at Nottingham Trent University in\u000d      particular (see the reference section 5 below). In addition, as a result\u000d      of Curtis's published work and presentations, UEA adopted short\u000d      internships in Brussels in relation to an EU-focused undergraduate module.\u000d    Curtis organised a two-day conference in June 2008 on placement learning\u000d      and other innovative approaches to learning and teaching in politics,\u000d      attracting delegates from NGOs, local government and lecturers in the\u000d      Politics discipline. The experiences of a local government officer and an\u000d      NGO organiser can be found in the collection of papers which grew out of\u000d      the conference (Curtis and Blair 2010).\u000d    In recognition of the impact of his research and teaching in this area,\u000d      Curtis was appointed national Discipline Associate for Politics and\u000d      International Relations at the Higher Education Academy's (HEA) former\u000d      Subject Network for Sociology, Anthropology and Politics (C-SAP) (2010-11)\u000d      and he is currently (late-2013) Discipline Lead for Politics at the HEA.\u000d      In these roles he has organised workshops (e.g., on issues in teaching\u000d      European Studies), facilitated sessions in early career events for\u000d      colleagues new to teaching, and has visited departments to help them\u000d      develop their teaching practice.\u000d    Curtis is co-founder and co-chair of the British International Studies\u000d      Association's (BISA) Learning and Teaching Working Group (BLT), which aims\u000d      to promote the scholarship of learning and teaching in IR. In this\u000d      capacity he has convened panels at annual BISA conferences and organised\u000d      one-day workshops on IT-assisted learning and teaching, assessment and\u000d      feedback practices in Politics and International Relations, and teaching\u000d      research methods. He has been co-opted onto the Executive Committee and\u000d      the Learning and Teaching and Outreach Subcommittees of BISA and appointed\u000d      chair of BISA's Teaching and Learning Committee, helping to shape its\u000d      initiatives regarding the promotion and professionalization of teaching in\u000d      the discipline and promoting the study of the Global Politics units of the\u000d      A level in Government and Politics, including liaising with the chief\u000d      examiner of these units over plans to produce a textbook on the subject\u000d      for sixth form students.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    This case study demonstrates clear and significant impact on placement\u000d      learning in a range of universities, according with the following\u000d      dimension of impact in REF 2014: `impacts within the higher education\u000d      sector, including on teaching or students, are included where they\u000d      extend significantly beyond the submitting HEI' (emphasis in the\u000d      original).

Some of his\u000d      writings are required reading on the module.\"\u000d    Royal Holloway (Senior Lecturer in Politics): \"Steven's research\u000d      has had a major impact upon teaching and learning in political\u000d      science\/international relations in the UK and more widely. He has provided\u000d      important evidence-based research (from peer-reviewed academic articles to\u000d      practical user-guides) that has influenced the delivery of teaching and\u000d      learning in his discipline. Steven has also provided important leadership\u000d      for the growth of teaching and learning specialist groups in our\u000d      professional associations (BISA\/PSA). In more concrete terms, Steven's\u000d      work has heavily influenced my own professional practice with regard to\u000d      political science placements\/internships. His research into student\u000d      placements has had a direct impact on our own teaching provision at Royal\u000d      Holloway, University of London.

Curtis's various projects and\u000d      interventions have focused in particular on:\u000d    - devising and evaluating new approaches to placement learning in the\u000d      discipline of Politics, in which very short placements are fully embedded\u000d      in the curriculum (by contrast to common practice on sandwich degrees and\u000d      stand-alone work-placement modules which typically involve `long'\u000d      placements, often with little connection to the subject matter of\u000d      students' studies);\u000d    - exploring use of blogs in students' academic writing development and\u000d      reflective learning;\u000d    - developing modes of feedback based on dialogue between tutors and\u000d      students and among students themselves, especially through audio\u000d      recordings, Web 2.0 tools such as blogs, and virtual learning\u000d      environments.\u000d    Curtis' research into placement learning, both as part of the\u000d      HEFCE-funded Scholarship of Engagement for Politics project and\u000d      subsequently, discovered significant benefits from using very short\u000d      placements of between five and 18 days and from linking placements to the\u000d      content of specific modules, by contrast to the then dominant modes of\u000d      placement learning in Politics which emphasised lengthy placements,\u000d      usually of ten weeks or more, and which were often free-standing affairs\u000d      not directly related to any class-based learning. Curtis' research\u000d      explored research-based approaches to learning on placements and means of\u000d      assessing such learning.\u000d    Curtis also explores the educational use of blogs in politics and\u000d      international relations, with a particular focus not only on how they\u000d      enable both tutors and students to provide feedback and other comments on\u000d      students' first drafts of written work as well as improving their academic\u000d      writing, but also as a form of learning diary for students on placements.\u000d      Curtis has also discovered that outside experts and practitioners, such as\u000d      diplomats and journalists, often leave supportive comments on the\u000d      students' work.\u000d    Curtis identifies similarities between blogging on publicly accessible\u000d      platforms and undertaking placements, especially the dimension which he\u000d      describes as `Learning in Public'. This incorporates some of the other\u000d      innovations he has been responsible for, including non-governmental\u000d      organisations (NGOs) providing training and role-play activities for\u000d      students and the use of educational visits and guest lecturers.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27639","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Patrick Thornberry's research has had significant impact on the\u000d\u000a      development of international and\u000d\u000a      national human rights law, and the work of non-governmental organizations\u000d\u000a      (NGOs). This is bound\u000d\u000a      up with the public positions he has occupied since the 1990s, which in\u000d\u000a      turn, has also informed his\u000d\u000a      research. Thus, the insights of his research in the 1980s and 1990s led to\u000d\u000a      the Chairmanship of the\u000d\u000a      NGO Minority Rights Group International (1999-2002), followed by\u000d\u000a      membership (2001-2014) of UN\u000d\u000a      CERD (the monitoring body of the International Convention on the\u000d\u000a      Elimination of Racial\u000d\u000a      Discrimination &#8212; ICERD). This was on the nomination of the UK government\u000d\u000a      and confirmed by\u000d\u000a      votes of the States parties to the Convention, most recently in 2010 when\u000d\u000a      Professor Thornberry\u000d\u000a      received 144 votes. He served as rapporteur (independent expert) for six\u000d\u000a      years up to 2008 (with\u000d\u000a      responsibility to prepare the annual report of CERD to the UN General\u000d\u000a      Assembly); country\u000d\u000a      rapporteur for 21 reporting States (9 States since 2008); chairman of the\u000d\u000a      Early Warning and Urgent\u000d\u000a      Action Group (2008-2010); and follow-up rapporteur on State party periodic\u000d\u000a      reports (from 2012), in\u000d\u000a      which he was responsible for monitoring progress made by States parties in\u000d\u000a      implementing the\u000d\u000a      recommendations of the Committee. Membership of CERD has been coterminous\u000d\u000a      with additional\u000d\u000a      UN advisory engagements and work with regional bodies such as the Council\u000d\u000a      of Europe, and with\u000d\u000a      NGOs and civil society groups.\u000d\u000a    Professor Thornberry was the first rapporteur of the UN Forum on Minorities\u000d\u000a      (2008), initiating the\u000d\u000a      discussion and preparing the initial draft of the Forum's Recommendations\u000d\u000a      on Minority Education,\u000d\u000a      which will influence governments worldwide. This stemmed from a request\u000d\u000a      from the then UN\u000d\u000a      Independent Expert on Minorities, specifically on account of Thornberry's\u000d\u000a      research on minority\u000d\u000a      rights in the field of education (see Thornberry, 2005, above); this work\u000d\u000a      is clearly reflected in the\u000d\u000a      Recommendations of the Forum. The former President of the Council of\u000d\u000a      Europe Advisory\u000d\u000a      Committee on National Minorities (2006-10) comments: `no other academic I\u000d\u000a      know has had such a\u000d\u000a      positive influence at the UN on minority issues as Professor Patrick\u000d\u000a      Thornberry.' In addition, in his\u000d\u000a      capacity as a former Chair of Minority Rights Group (MRG), Professor\u000d\u000a      Thornberry has maintained\u000d\u000a      a relationship with the Group. A spokesperson, writing on behalf of MRG,\u000d\u000a      notes: `Patrick's research\u000d\u000a      has most certainly had an influence on our work here at MRG. His books are\u000d\u000a      standard texts for us\u000d\u000a      in our promotion of minority and indigenous rights worldwide. Arguments at\u000d\u000a      MRG on finer points of\u000d\u000a      minority rights law can be definitively settled by reference to\u000d\u000a      Thornberry.'\u000d\u000a    Professor Thornberry was primary or shared rapporteur\/author of several\u000d\u000a      General\u000d\u000a      Recommendations (GRs) on racial discrimination. These include GR\u000d\u000a      29 on discrimination on the\u000d\u000a      grounds of caste or descent (2002), GR 32 on special measures\/affirmative\u000d\u000a      action (2009), and GR\u000d\u000a      34 on discrimination against persons of African Descent (2011); the latter\u000d\u000a      were informed by\u000d\u000a      research developed from his publications in 2005. Regarding Thornberry's\u000d\u000a      work on the Committee\u000d\u000a      for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a senior representative\u000d\u000a      says: `While the work of CERD\u000d\u000a      is a collective one, contributions made by individual experts are highly\u000d\u000a      important to the overall\u000d\u000a      results of the work of the Committee. In this regard, Professor Thornberry\u000d\u000a      has effectively\u000d\u000a      contributed to the jurisprudence of CERD by using his academic research,\u000d\u000a      particularly on\u000d\u000a      minorities and racial discrimination'. She highlights in particular his\u000d\u000a      `crucial role in preparing initial\u000d\u000a      drafts of General Recommendations'. These provide guidance to the\u000d\u000a      governments of the 176\u000d\u000a      States parties to the convention and influence the work of civil society\u000d\u000a      in those countries. `He was\u000d\u000a      the key member of CERD involved in producing the Committee's\u000d\u000a      ground-breaking\u000d\u000a      recommendations on caste or descent GR 29, 2002' (spokesperson for\u000d\u000a      Minority Rights Group).\u000d\u000a      This remains `a major influence on UN and governmental approaches'\u000d\u000a      (President of the Council of\u000d\u000a      Europe Advisory Committee on National Minorities). GR 29 has been\u000d\u000a      extensively employed by\u000d\u000a      Dalit and Buraku groups in advocacy strategies (for example the Dalit\u000d\u000a      Solidarity Network's 2011\u000d\u000a      report recommending implementation of GR 29 in the UK) and has also\u000d\u000a      influenced legislative\u000d\u000a      changes in the UK, where caste discrimination has recently been recognised\u000d\u000a      as a form of racial\u000d\u000a      discrimination.\u000d\u000a    Thornberry's earlier work in developing the UN Declaration on the\u000d\u000a        Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u000d\u000a      `where he was the leading intellectual thinker' (President of the Council\u000d\u000a      of Europe, Advisory\u000d\u000a      Committee on National Minorities, 2006-10) led to further research on indigenous\u000d\u000a      education rights\u000d\u000a      (reference 5, section 3) which informed the UN Expert Mechanism on\u000d\u000a      Indigenous Rights and its\u000d\u000a      `Advice' to governments in 2009. Its impact has extended to indigenous\u000d\u000a      NGOs. For example, his\u000d\u000a      research was cited in a recent (2012) submission to CERD in support of the\u000d\u000a      Sami people's claim\u000d\u000a      that self-identification principles were leading to the dilution of Sami\u000d\u000a      identity in Finland: CERD\u000d\u000a      agreed with the submission and changed its advice to the government. Sami\u000d\u000a      organisations\u000d\u000a      incorporated this advice into their lobbying of the Finnish government in\u000d\u000a      order to defend their rights\u000d\u000a      to land and culture.\u000d\u000a    On hate speech, Professor Thornberry's research has contributed\u000d\u000a      to moving UN efforts on from\u000d\u000a      `defamation of religions' to addressing `incitement to hatred'. In 2011,\u000d\u000a      following the publication of\u000d\u000a      his article in Religion and Human Rights (reference 6 in section 3), CERD\u000d\u000a      appointed him as co-rapporteur\u000d\u000a      for the discussion on racist hate speech, which took place in 2012. The\u000d\u000a      text of a general\u000d\u000a      recommendation was presented to CERD in 2013 and was adopted as GR 35 on\u000d\u000a      `combating racist\u000d\u000a      hate speech'. Initial reaction suggests that the recommendation is being\u000d\u000a      treated as a ground-breaking\u000d\u000a      development and it is cited by a senior representative of the Rule of Law\u000d\u000a      and Democracy\u000d\u000a      section, UN OHCHR, as one of `numerous occasions [in which] Patrick\u000d\u000a      Thornberry has been able\u000d\u000a      to bring findings from his own research into the work of CERD and by so\u000d\u000a      doing influenced its work\u000d\u000a      positively.'\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Patrick Thornberry's research on human rights, particularly regarding\u000d\u000a      international standards on\u000d\u000a      racial (including caste) discrimination, minority rights, rights of\u000d\u000a      indigenous peoples, and hate\u000d\u000a      speech, has (1) influenced the development of legal principle through\u000d\u000a      advice on policy and\u000d\u000a      participation in the authorship of international standards, particularly\u000d\u000a      those of the United Nations;\u000d\u000a      (2) influenced the development of national legislation and practice\u000d\u000a      including legislation in the UK;\u000d\u000a      (3) facilitated the human rights work of international and national\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisations\u000d\u000a      (NGOs) working to defend the rights of minority, indigenous and caste\u000d\u000a      communities.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Keele University\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Keele University","InstitutionName":"Keele University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10007767}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

He has carried out research on minority rights\u000d\u000a      throughout his career.\u000d\u000a      The principal insights and findings from research between 1993 and 2010\u000d\u000a      are in the following\u000d\u000a      areas:\u000d\u000a    (a) On minority rights: Thornberry demonstrated that their\u000d\u000a      expression had been largely\u000d\u000a      subsumed under international standards on discrimination, which, while\u000d\u000a      functioning as starting\u000d\u000a      points for protection of cultural, religious and linguistic identity,\u000d\u000a      lacked appropriate indicators for\u000d\u000a      the expression of identities. He suggested that lacunae were particularly\u000d\u000a      evident in minority\u000d\u000a      education and language, on recognition of the status and membership of\u000d\u000a      minorities, and on the\u000d\u000a      participation of minorities in decisions affecting them, and analysed key\u000d\u000a      principles and\u000d\u000a      instruments to move the discourse forward (references 1 &amp; 5). This\u000d\u000a      accounted for the\u000d\u000a      relationship between specific principles and general international law,\u000d\u000a      and apparatuses for the\u000d\u000a      implementation of rights. His approach aimed to facilitate understanding\u000d\u000a      the status and role of\u000d\u000a      minority rights in the corpus of international standards on human rights.\u000d\u000a    (b) On racial discrimination: his research concentrated on\u000d\u000a      exploring the concept and grounds of\u000d\u000a      discrimination, the aims and objectives of international standards,\u000d\u000a      affirmative action, the work\u000d\u000a      of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), and\u000d\u000a      the integration of\u000d\u000a      discrimination standards with those on minorities and indigenous peoples\u000d\u000a      (references 4 &amp; 6).\u000d\u000a      Research findings clustered around the relationship between\u000d\u000a      anti-discrimination and equality\u000d\u000a      standards and the norms embodying freedoms, including cultural and speech\u000d\u000a      freedoms, the\u000d\u000a      lack of attention to the rights of particularly vulnerable groups,\u000d\u000a      including caste groups, and\u000d\u000a      dilemmas over collective rights in contexts animated by individualist\u000d\u000a      paradigms.\u000d\u000a    (c) On indigenous peoples: Thornberry researched extensively into\u000d\u000a      the place of indigenous\u000d\u000a      peoples in the history of international law, understandings of\u000d\u000a      `indigenousness', the applicability\u000d\u000a      of general and specific norms to advance their interests,\u000d\u000a      self-determination, and standards on\u000d\u000a      lands, territories and defence of indigenous cultures (references 2 &amp;\u000d\u000a      4). The research highlights\u000d\u000a      the stresses under which indigenous peoples endeavour to survive and\u000d\u000a      defend their cultures.\u000d\u000a      These necessitate urgent action to adopt and implement existing standards\u000d\u000a      of human rights as\u000d\u000a      well as broadening of paradigms to accommodate indigenous world-views.\u000d\u000a    (d) On hate speech, his research has focused on moves to\u000d\u000a      proscribe `defamation of religions', in\u000d\u000a      light of events such as those following publication of `The Satanic\u000d\u000a      Verses', and the `Danish\u000d\u000a      cartoons'. He concluded that proscribing `incitement to hatred' fitted\u000d\u000a      into networks of human\u000d\u000a      rights standards less equivocally than proscribing 'defamation of\u000d\u000a      religions', but that it was not\u000d\u000a      always easy to distinguish attacks on believers from attacks on doctrine.\u000d\u000a      He cautioned that\u000d\u000a      readings of freedom of expression should recognise that the boundaries of\u000d\u000a      speech\u000d\u000a      acceptability vary among nations and cultures and that international\u000d\u000a      standards should take this\u000d\u000a      into account (reference 6).\u000d\u000a    In practice there is overlap and convergence between the above four\u000d\u000a      areas, as is evidenced in\u000d\u000a      Thornberry's published research.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28082","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"241170","Name":"Seychelles"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context: Concurrent with ongoing multilateral trade negotiations\u000d\u000a      (2001-), UoM research has sought to target and maximise impact through the\u000d\u000a      building of extended and sustained relationships with actors in the WTO\u000d\u000a      (ambassadors, lawyers and knowledge brokers), national governments\u000d\u000a      (specifically South Africa, Turkey, The Seychelles and Bangladesh), and\u000d\u000a      international and national civil society organisations.

In 2011 a document prepared by\u000d\u000a      Wilkinson &#8212; `Four Principles for Reforming the WTO' &#8212; was circulated by\u000d\u000a      the knowledge broker the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable\u000d\u000a      Development (ICTSD) to all trade delegates (c.2000), including attending\u000d\u000a      trade ministers, and also translated into Swedish [1]. As the Chief\u000d\u000a      Executive of ICTSD attests: \"findings have been picked up directly by\u000d\u000a        trade actors, with the research effectively transforming insights,\u000d\u000a        narratives and bargaining tools for developing countries in the WTO.\u000d\u000a        Professor Wilkinson's contributions to the work of ICTSD have been\u000d\u000a        crucial... contributing to our ongoing work on the importance of\u000d\u000a        sustainable development within the international trade system\" [2].\u000d\u000a      Wilkinson has advised a significant number of governments at the highest\u000d\u000a      levels. Prominent examples include South Africa, the Seychelles, Turkey\u000d\u000a      and Bangladesh.\u000d\u000a    South Africa: Wilkinson has built a sustained, high-trust\u000d\u000a      relationship with South African trade negotiators, offering advice on an ad\u000d\u000a        hoc basis since 2009. The country's Ambassador, and Permanent\u000d\u000a      Representative to the WTO, cites the value of publication [E] in his\u000d\u000a      existing [3] and ongoing work, noting that: \"I have also served as the\u000d\u000a        WTO Chair of the Committee of Trade and Development... In this capacity,\u000d\u000a        and as an active participant in several developing country coalitions\u000d\u000a        and alliances, I have sought out researchers and writers that could\u000d\u000a        assist me in the work I was doing to advance the interests of developing\u000d\u000a        countries in the WTO... My association and collaboration with Professor\u000d\u000a        Rorden Wilkinson enhanced my capacity to engage more effectively in all\u000d\u000a        of these roles... Evidence of the influence of Rorden's work on the\u000d\u000a        negotiations can be seen in at least two WTO proposals that I\u000d\u000a        co-authored on behalf of developing countries in the WTO... I have also\u000d\u000a        had the chance to comment on his work... [where] I pay tribute\u000d\u000a        to Rorden's research and analytical work, and in particular the value\u000d\u000a        this has for practitioners, such as myself\" [4].\u000d\u000a    Seychelles: In the period 2007-09 Wilkinson was Special Advisor to\u000d\u000a      the Vice President and Minister of Finance on WTO accession. As the Former\u000d\u000a      Director General of Trade testifies, Wilkinson both assisted in brokering\u000d\u000a      relationships between Seychelles officials and WTO actors, and \"his\u000d\u000a        research on `asymmetries' was usefully translated into concrete advice\u000d\u000a        concerning which specific aspects of trade should be open to\u000d\u000a        liberalisation, and which should be protected as a part of the country's\u000d\u000a        WTO accession package... Subsequent to these discussions, the Seychelles\u000d\u000a        proceeded with re-engaging the WTO in respect of Seychelles' application\u000d\u000a        of accession but adjusted its offers to the Membership in light of the\u000d\u000a        advice that Professor Wilkinson provided\" [5]. Correspondingly, the\u000d\u000a      country's Minister of Foreign Affairs points to longer term aspects: \"Professor\u000a        Wilkinson's work has been particularly important, as at the present time\u000d\u000a        there is a notable lack of rigorous academic work that underscores both\u000d\u000a        the vulnerability of the Seychelles economy to fluctuations in external\u000d\u000a        demand... and the special features of the Seychelles economy, which\u000d\u000a        require specific policy recommendations... Professor Wilkinson has\u000d\u000a        provided useful advice over a period of time [1999-2011] that greatly\u000d\u000a        assisted our negotiating position. Seychelles has built a credible offer\u000d\u000a        for WTO accession... Wilkinson's advice has contributed to this\"\u000d\u000a      [6].\u000d\u000a    Turkey: In 2007, the Turkish government invited Wilkinson to\u000d\u000a      contribute a paper to a government sponsored event on foreign trade; the\u000d\u000a      brief was to come up with `new ideas on trade'. The paper &#8212; highlighting\u000d\u000a      institutional asymmetries in international trade; and the role of language\u000d\u000a      in constructing false representations of developing countries and shaping\u000d\u000a      their behaviour in international trade &#8212; was subsequently published in the\u000d\u000a      Undersecretariat's official journal (Vol.3:1, 2009) as `The Problematic of\u000d\u000a      Trade and Development Beyond the Doha Round', and reported on the major\u000d\u000a      Turkish trade blog dtm.gov. As the conference organiser confirms:\u000d\u000a      \"The event was very successful... [and] attended by high ranking\u000d\u000a        bureaucrats of the Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade as well as by\u000d\u000a        practitioners of foreign trade... Wilkinson's contribution made a\u000d\u000a        constructive contribution to ongoing debates within a Turkish context on\u000d\u000a        the Doha round... and the work continues to be important as revealed by\u000d\u000a        the comments... from the Undersecretariat\" [7].\u000d\u000a    Bangladesh: Wilkinson has been appointed expert advisor to two\u000d\u000a      high level working groups, `LDC IV Monitor' and `Future of the UN\u000d\u000a      Development System'. The former (a non-official UN sanctioned group) is\u000d\u000a      facilitated through collaboration between the Commonwealth Secretariat,\u000d\u000a      OECD Development Centre and the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Bangladesh.\u000d\u000a      The Chair of LDC IV Monitor confirms that: \"Wilkinson's expertise has\u000d\u000a        been valuable in shaping the structure and content of the upcoming\u000d\u000a        biennial report of the Monitor. His comments and observations have\u000d\u000a        enabled us to significantly improve the key messages... [and] The\u000d\u000a        chapters on Trade and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) also benefited\u000d\u000a        greatly from his critical inputs... Wilkinson has helped us to connect\u000d\u000a        to the frontier issues concerning the development challenges currently\u000d\u000a        confronted by the LDCs. Professor Wilkinson's work remains vital, as he\u000d\u000a        continues to remain engaged with the LDC IV Monitor\" [8].\u000d\u000a    Rethinking global trade architecture: In order to enhance the\u000d\u000a      hands-on policy engagement documented above, debates concerning the\u000d\u000a      contours of global trade have been nurtured. Wilkinson's dissemination and\u000d\u000a      consulting activities, via a network of high level contacts across a range\u000d\u000a      of states and organisations, were mobilised within the inaugural Global\u000d\u000a      Poverty Summit in South Africa (16-19\/1\/2011). This event, initiated,\u000d\u000a      co-ordinated and convened by Wilkinson, brought together 50 of the world's\u000d\u000a      leading poverty thinkers (including former heads of state, serving\u000d\u000a      ministers, country ambassadors, iconic and Nobel Prize winning\u000d\u000a      intellectuals, leading academics, heads of international NGOs, and\u000d\u000a      secretaries-general, under secretaries-general and assistant\u000d\u000a      secretaries-general of UN Institutions). The purpose of the event was to\u000d\u000a      influence progress in two international public policy initiatives &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      Millennium Development Goals and the WTO's Doha Development Agenda &#8212; as\u000d\u000a      well as engage in public debate. At the conclusion of the summit, two\u000d\u000a      major international declarations were agreed and produced by participants\u000d\u000a      on `Africa and the Doha Development Agenda' and `Africa and the Millennium\u000d\u000a      Development Goals'. The Deputy Director General of the WTO (also Nigeria's\u000d\u000a      Ambassador and Permanent Representative) substantiates the value of this\u000d\u000a      event, and Wilkinson's contributions to WTO ministerial fora\u000d\u000a      (2003-2011), stating that: \"I have found Professor Wilkinson's work\u000d\u000a        particularly helpful in the shaping of the global trade agenda, with\u000d\u000a        respect to the interaction between trade policy, trade negotiations,\u000d\u000a        sustainable development and poverty reduction...

The case\u000d\u000a      is built upon ongoing research; the first grant (British Academy) secured\u000d\u000a      in 2003, and subsequent grants secured in 2006\/2010 (Rory &amp; Elizabeth\u000d\u000a      Brooks Foundation), 2007 (British Academy, Centre for International\u000d\u000a      Governance Innovation\/Trudeau Fund), 2009 (Nuffield Foundation), 2011\u000d\u000a      (Henry Luce Foundation) and 2012 (Brooks\/DTI South Africa).\u000d\u000a    This research programme systematically challenges conventional wisdom &#8212;\u000d\u000a      that the problems developing countries and LDCs face relate specifically\u000d\u000a      to the nature of their economies and polities, and\/or the nature of\u000d\u000a      relations with former and quasi-former colonial states &#8212; clearly\u000d\u000a      demonstrating that developing countries are not `naysayers', `foot\u000d\u000a      draggers' or `free-riders' in multilateral trade liberalisation. It\u000d\u000a        seeks to actively inform multilateral trade negotiations, and is\u000d\u000a        designed to seek improvements in the trading prospects of developing and\u000d\u000a        least developed countries. Through sustained research, UoM expertise\u000d\u000a      is recognised by key actors within national governments, NGOs and\u000d\u000a      grassroots organisations as challenging the portrayal of developing\u000d\u000a      countries as passive participants. Instead, the research argues that these\u000d\u000a      states are not given credit for their contribution, even though they were\u000d\u000a      and are actively and constructively engaged in trade negotiations. In sum,\u000d\u000a      such countries are important agents in global trade [E].\u000d\u000a    The conventional narrative in trade circles is also challenged &#8212;\u000d\u000a      that the global trading system will collapse if developing countries do\u000d\u000a      not co-operate (the `bicycle' theory) [D]. These `discourses of crises'\u000d\u000a      put undue pressure on the least powerful states, and a major contribution\u000d\u000a      of the research has been to stress to LDCs that, in the face of a\u000d\u000a      perceived crisis, pressures to hurriedly liberalise should be resisted.\u000d\u000a      The asymmetrical outcomes of consecutive multilateral trade negotiations,\u000d\u000a      which similarly militate against developing countries and LDCs, is also\u000d\u000a      highlighted, and it is stressed that equal participation is often\u000d\u000a      impossible because of a lack of necessary resources, technical expertise\u000d\u000a      and opportunity [A][B][C].\u000d\u000a    Research was undertaken in four phases. Phase 1 examined the\u000d\u000a      legal and institutional disadvantages confronting developing countries in\u000d\u000a      WTO negotiations and their long-run effect [C]. Phase 2 explored\u000d\u000a      the role of political practices and behavioural norms in negotiations, and\u000d\u000a      the negative impact they have on the capacity of developing countries and\u000d\u000a      LDCs to participate [E]. Phase 3 examined the construction and\u000d\u000a      effects of knowledge, discourse and common sense on the negotiating\u000d\u000a      positions and behaviour of developing countries [B][D], and processes of\u000d\u000a      institutional socialisation [A]. Phase 4 is currently exploring\u000d\u000a      processes of institutional reform and ideational reconfiguration. Key\u000d\u000a        Findings from the research include:\u000d\u000a    1. As a broad group, developing countries are structurally and\u000d\u000a      institutionally disadvantaged by WTO rules, norms, negotiating practices\u000d\u000a      and decision making procedures.\u000d\u000a    2. Common sense ideas about the value of trade, the consequences\u000d\u000a      of institutional breakdown and crisis, and the means by which trade gains\u000d\u000a      are `measured', distort the negotiating positions of less able states.\u000d\u000a    3. Participation in the multilateral trade regime socialises\u000d\u000a      states into modes of behaviour that reinforce existing inequalities,\u000d\u000a      regarding both agenda setting and outcome.\u000d\u000a    4. The capacity of developing countries to effectively negotiate\u000d\u000a      is further inhibited by a lack of knowledge about the institutional and\u000d\u000a      structural inequalities they confront.\u000d\u000a    5. The most likely reforms of the WTO will at best maintain, and\u000d\u000a      at worst exacerbate, asymmetries already embedded in the multilateral\u000d\u000a      trading system.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28085","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Pathways to impact: The impacts emanating from this research are\u000d\u000a      grounded upon thoroughgoing engagements with policymakers, with specific\u000d\u000a      areas of impact around the mobilisation of civic participation and\u000d\u000a      positive action within society, and the development of a robust and\u000d\u000a      demonstrable methodological grounding that has influenced policymakers\u000d\u000a      in a range of settings.

The research also influenced the publication of `The Capital Ambition\u000d\u000a      Guide to Behaviour Change', which included input from 21 Greater London\u000d\u000a      councils. [6].\u000d\u000a    Influence on policy-makers is also observed through on-the-record\u000d\u000a        statements. Greg Clark made his first public speech on the `Big\u000d\u000a      Society' at the project conclusion event (23rd June, 2010). In\u000d\u000a      the press release accompanying the speech, he states: \"This research\u000d\u000a        confirms my fundamental belief that people are perfectly willing and\u000d\u000a        able to take the lead in transforming their neighbourhoods; and the more\u000d\u000a        they take pride in the places they live, the more they want to\u000d\u000a        contribute.

The themes and methodologies covered by this\u000d\u000a      project have been continued within a further ESRC award of ~&#163;500,000 for\u000d\u000a      `Citizen Contribution to Local Public Services: Field Experiments in\u000d\u000a      Institutions Incorporating Social Information' (2013-2015), with\u000d\u000a      Richardson as Co-I.\u000d\u000a    The background: The research considers how positive civic\u000d\u000a      behaviours leading to `common goods' might be encouraged, focusing\u000d\u000a      specifically on the different mechanisms of `active citizenship' that\u000d\u000a      might be employed by policymakers. Similar themes were broached by the\u000d\u000a      previous Labour administration within the Empowerment White Paper\u000d\u000a      `Communities in Control: Real People Real Power' (2008), and they presage\u000d\u000a      a growing interest by policymakers in softer `nudge' mechanisms, rather\u000d\u000a      than seeking to influence human behaviour through `hard' interventions,\u000d\u000a      such as legislation or regulation [D][E].\u000d\u000a    The method: Recognising the reality of these difficult policy\u000d\u000a      choices, the project used a variety of methods, including RCTs, in order\u000d\u000a      to test different mechanisms, and measure their effectiveness in\u000d\u000a      persuading citizens to change civic behaviours and attitudes. In total\u000d\u000a      eight RCTs, two design experiments, and two separate analyses of secondary\u000d\u000a      data were undertaken [E] (with examples in [A][B]). It was notable that\u000d\u000a      whilst RCTs are considered by many policy communities to be the sine\u000d\u000a        qua non of evaluation, they are under-utilised by political\u000d\u000a      scientists based in the UK. Traditionally policymakers have struggled to\u000d\u000a      find the appropriate mechanisms to achieve their policy goals, and it was\u000d\u000a      thus significant that whilst the success of the methods employed rested\u000d\u000a      upon their ability to be taken up and used independently by policymakers,\u000d\u000a      the research also pointed to the need to seek policy outcomes in a local\u000d\u000a      and decentralised manner [C][D].\u000d\u000a    The findings: Shifts in behaviour varied both with reference to\u000d\u000a      the specific method applied, and in terms of the subject matter. For\u000d\u000a      instance: a reminder, accompanied by feedback, encouraged citizens to\u000d\u000a      recycle their waste; the making public of contributions made some citizens\u000d\u000a      more likely to pledge and donate to charity; providing information in the\u000d\u000a      form of a booklet led to a greater willingness to donate organs; and\u000d\u000a      publicising how many other citizens had signed a petition encouraged\u000d\u000a      signing (when the figure was over one million). In line with these\u000d\u000a      findings, it was considered whether it is more effective to nudge citizens\u000d\u000a      towards a desirable outcome by using cues, feedback or social incentives,\u000d\u000a      or even whether it is preferable to provide citizens with an opportunity\u000d\u000a      to think and reflect upon key social problems before action is taken. In\u000d\u000a      addition, survey data revealed that the main drivers for civic action are\u000d\u000a      based on `positive feelings' for the neighbourhood, rather than social\u000d\u000a      norms or good citizenship per se. The key message emerging from\u000d\u000a      this research is that governments and associated agencies must seek to\u000d\u000a        customise the messages they convey to citizens in each case, so as to\u000d\u000a        ensure they nudge them towards the desired outcome. The methods\u000d\u000a      showcased provide the basis upon which this customisation can occur, with\u000d\u000a      further refinement possible as the number of experimental interventions\u000d\u000a      increases. The research continues to shape government policy approaches\u000d\u000a      via `soft mechanisms' through which desirable civic behaviours can be\u000d\u000a      encouraged.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28091","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pathways to Impact: The increasing salience of the themes of\u000a      immigration and diversity has created a pressing demand for\u000a      research-informed expertise.

The\u000a      report was subsequently published on the Home Office website (1\/2012),\u000a      forming part of a widely cited and highly regarded set of evidence-driven\u000a      academic reports from MAC to policymakers. The report led to an important\u000a      shift in the policy recommendations submitted to ministers, switching from\u000a      an emphasis on negative social impacts to an emphasis on the limited\u000a      impact of migration on social cohesion, and a call for greater focus on\u000a      economic deprivation [2].\u000a    (iii) Government Office for Science (GO-S): Both EMBES and other\u000a      core research by the team informed the GO-S report on `The Future of\u000a      Identity', with UoM findings &#8212; on generational change in religious\u000a      identities, on the role of relative deprivation and perceived\u000a      discrimination on ethnic and British identity, and of dissatisfaction with\u000a      British democracy on the part of second-generation people of Caribbean\u000a      heritage &#8212; highlighting opportunities and challenges for government over\u000a      the next ten years, via policy recommendations published in the final\u000a      report (1\/2013) [3].\u000a    (iv) Cabinet Office\/Electoral Commission: Findings on electoral\u000a      registration have been drawn on, in developing proposals for the planned\u000a      move to individual electoral registration (IER). The Electoral Commission\u000a      confirm that: \"EMBES has enabled us to better understand the\u000a        registration levels of important groups within Britain... [and] will\u000a        better facilitate the Electoral Commission's future assessments of the\u000a        move to IER. It will be an important source of evidence for reviewing\u000a        the impact of the changes on the five ethnic groups included in the\u000a        study\" [4].\u000a    (2) IMPACT ON POLITICAL PARTIES (Expert Briefings):\u000a    (i) The Conservative Party: Ford and Goodwin presented key\u000a      findings, on the far right and attitudes to minorities, to senior\u000a      Conservative MPs and policymakers, in a meeting chaired by the Tim\u000a      Montgomerie, editor of conservativehome.com (5\/2009), and two meetings\u000a      chaired by Baroness Warsi (12\/2009 &amp; 1\/2011). Resultantly, UoM\u000a      research helped to inform the `Nothing British' campaign group, founded to\u000a      combat the BNP. The researchers attended a strategy dinner (3\/2010),\u000a      followed by regular communication with the group's director, who commended\u000a      Ford's contribution: \"Thank you very much for taking the time to speak\u000a        to us yesterday. I...thought we made good progress on a difficult issue\"\u000a      [5]. Additionally, Ford and Goodwin's research on attitudes to Muslims and\u000a      minorities provided important background information for Baroness Warsi's\u000a      influential early 2011 speech on Islamophobia.\u000a    (ii) The Labour Party: Ford has been consulted by advisors to Ed\u000a      Miliband MP (Leader of the Opposition) concerning the development of\u000a      migration and integration policy, briefing senior policy aides (12\/2011\u000a      &amp; 11\/2012), and preparing a paper for Harvey Redgrave, senior Miliband\u000a      aide and Head of Home Affairs policy. This was followed up with an\u000a      interchange on migration and integration issues, drawing on EMBES, which\u000a      informed the approach outlined in Miliband's prominent speech on\u000a      immigration and integration (12\/2012). Redgrave attests: \"Your analysis\u000a        on public attitudes and segregation made an important contribution to Ed\u000a        Miliband's integration speech in December and Ed was personally very\u000a        grateful for your efforts\" [5].\u000a    (iii) The Liberal Democrats: Ford delivered an expert briefing on\u000a      British immigration attitudes to the Liberal Democrats `Immigration\u000a      Working Group' (20\/3\/2013). The specially prepared briefing was attended\u000a      by senior policymakers and was well received, with a former Minister\u000a      (Stunell) noting that: \"We really appreciated your clear and cogent\u000a        presentation of public opinion evidence and research... The information\u000a        you provided has helped to inform our discussions and will impact on how\u000a        we develop the Liberal Democrat policy in this area come September\"\u000a      [5].\u000a    (iv) All Party Parliamentary Group on Migration (APPGM): Ford has\u000a      built a strong ongoing relationship with the APPGM, which aims to develop\u000a      a balanced and informed debate on migration among MPs and policymakers. He\u000a      wrote a widely circulated briefing document (7\/2011) summarising key\u000a      research findings, appeared in person at two MP briefings (7\/2011 &amp;\u000a      12\/2011) and at a Labour conference fringe meeting (9\/2011). The briefing\u000a      has been described &#8212; in a letter signed by key figures in the group &#8212; as \"a\u000a        vital resource, enabling policymakers to inform themselves about the key\u000a        academic findings on this important and contentious issue\" [6].\u000a    (3) IMPACT ON CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS\u000a    (i) The `Changing Minds' Consortium has provided over &#163;250K to\u000a      develop and analyse two modules of immigration attitudes survey questions.\u000a      Key results have been presented to the senior grant managers from these\u000a      organisations (a cross-section of the most influential third sector\u000a      organisations working in this policy area) in regular briefings, and have\u000a      influenced their strategy. The former co-ordinator of Changing Minds notes\u000a      that: \"analysis from the British Social Attitudes survey has informed a\u000a        number of advocacy strategies of civil society organisations... Ford\u000a        has, through introductions facilitated by foundations, briefed and\u000a        educated policymakers, opinion formers and decision-makers (including\u000a        politicians) directly. For example, briefings to the All Party\u000a        Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Migration were widely circulated beyond\u000a        those directly briefed....Dr Ford's work has clearly had multi-level\u000a        impacts on public understanding and debate on race, migration,\u000a        integration, and identity in the UK. Similarly, the current\u000a      co-ordinator, adds: \"Dr Ford has been an invaluable contributor to the\u000a        work of funders and NGOs in the field of immigration. He has presented\u000a        to a wide cross section of individuals, provided written briefings, and\u000a        developed an important set of immigration focused questions to augment\u000a        the data generated by the British Social Attitudes. Dr Ford's academic\u000a        rigour and accessible style has enabled organisations to use his work to\u000a        shape their strategies: There is no question he has improved the quality\u000a        of evidence and analysis underpinning this policy area\" [7].\u000a    (ii) The Runneymede Trust: Sobolewska and Heath's ongoing\u000a      collaboration with Runneymede led to a successful bid to develop the\u000a      website ethnicpolitics.org to disseminate key findings from EMBES\u000a      (1997 &amp; 2010) in an accessible format, providing interactive analysis\u000a      facilities so that users can easily generate their own data\u000a      visualisations. Heath wrote a briefing paper with the organisation's\u000a      research director that was widely circulated to policymakers via the\u000a      Trust's website, and through its role as secretary to the All Party\u000a      Parliamentary Group on Race and Community. As Runneymede's Head of Policy\u000a      Research attests: \"Maria's work is particularly valuable... in\u000a        explaining this evidence to politicians, journalists, thinktanks, other\u000a        race equality and migrant organisations, and indeed wider society. With\u000a        EMBES, we now have much more robust evidence and are also able to\u000a        disaggregate patterns among different ethnic groups. We have used this\u000a        evidence... as our response to the government's proposals on individual\u000a        electoral registration... and Runnymede has highlighted Maria's findings\u000a        in discussions with ministers, civil servants and indeed wider society\"\u000a      [8]. EMBES research and data has helped to inform and shape public debate\u000a      about how different political parties appeal differently to different\u000a      ethnic groups, especially how the Conservatives are still much less likely\u000a      to appeal to ethnic minority voters. There have also been press articles\u000a      discussing EMBES data in conjunction with this debate, including twice in\u000a      the Economist magazine [9]. This finding also informed a Radio 4 episode\u000a      of the `Analysis' programme: `A New Black Politics?' (6\/11\/2011). Online\u000a      briefing papers and a video about EMBES have been uploaded on the\u000a      Runnymede Trust's website, with the team publishing an article online for\u000a      the Guardian's `Comment is Free' column that attracted over 500 responses\u000a      [9]. The work was also cited by Lord Ashcroft, conservativehome.com, and\u000a      by Gavin Barwell MP in the Telegraph [9].\u000a    (iii) British Future: Ford has communicated findings to senior\u000a      staff, regularly consulting over research and communications strategies.\u000a      In particular, he co-authored a widely discussed report on ethnic mixing &#8212;\u000a      `The Melting Pot Generation'. The director of British Future confirmed the\u000a      value of this contribution: \"We have regularly made use of Rob's\u000a        expert opinions and research knowledge... to ensure our own work is\u000a        accurate... Rob's contributions... have had a genuine impact on the work\u000a        that we do... help[ing] to ensure that the accessible frame we\u000a        offered to media outlets &#8212; about athlete Jessica Ennis being\u000a        representative of an emerging social trend and \"generation shift\" in\u000a        attitudes &#8212; was reported in a solidly informed, evidence-based way,\u000a        which used that accessible personal story as a way in to reporting\u000a        academic research findings, helping academic research to reach a very\u000a        wide public audience\" [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The past fifteen years have seen intense debate around the social and\u000a      political impact of rising ethnic diversity, with a range of stakeholders\u000a      consequently reliant on the provision and diffusion of sophisticated and\u000a      evidence-based analysis. Research undertaken at the University of\u000a      Manchester (UoM) has risen to this challenge, reaching out to a variety of\u000a      individuals and groups, providing timely research-based interventions to\u000a      help shape, inform and improve policymaking and political discussion in\u000a      this critical yet poorly understood area. Sustained collaboration,\u000a      alongside the targeted dissemination of findings to key decision makers\u000a      and civil society organisations has enhanced public debate, and shaped key\u000a      interventions made by: Governmental actors (e.g. DCLG, GO-S, Electoral\u000a      Commission), the three main political parties, Parliamentary Committees\u000a      (APPGM &amp; MAC) and a number of civil society organisations (e.g.\u000a      Runnymede Trust, Changing Minds).\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    The University of Manchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Manchester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007798}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    (all references available upon request &#8212; AUR)\u000a    Key findings from all three lines of enquiry have been published in\u000a      leading political science and sociology journals.

It is built upon two large grants;\u000a      `Understanding Immigration Attitudes' (funded by the `Changing Minds'\u000a      consortium) and the `Ethnic Minority British Election Study' (ESRC). The\u000a      key researchers are: Dr Robert Ford (Lecturer, 2007-); Dr Matthew Goodwin\u000a      (2007-9, now University of Nottingham); Dr Maria Sobolewska (Lecturer,\u000a      2010-); and Professor Anthony Heath (2010-). A series of overlapping\u000a      projects have been undertaken with the overarching aim of developing a\u000a      clearer understanding of the political and social impacts of immigration\u000a      and ethnic change in Britain. Several intersecting trends background this\u000a      research: the largest and most diverse influx of immigrants in British\u000a      history; the growth of British born second and third generation minority\u000a      populations; new concerns about Islamic extremism and terrorism, community\u000a      cohesion and integration; and the rise of new radical right political\u000a      movements looking to exploit tensions, such as the British National Party\u000a      (BNP) and the UK Independence Party (UKIP). To date, the team has pursued\u000a      three main lines of enquiry:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aAttitudes to immigrants and ethnic minorities. The team have\u000a        examined how the British view immigrant and minority groups, measuring\u000a        how these views are changing over time and considering which factors\u000a        explain them. An important decline in prejudice against ethnic\u000a        minorities driven by generational change has been clearly shown, albeit\u000a        with an undertow of persistent and intense anxiety about immigration\u000a        [E]. Through the use of innovative survey methods, the research reveals\u000a        pragmatism and flexibility in British views about immigrants,\u000a        challenging the conventional wisdom that the dominant British\u000a        perspective is one that opposes all forms of immigration. In fact,\u000a        Britons appear positive about immigration when they see a clear economic\u000a        benefit, suggesting attitudes are more complex than commonly assumed\u000a        [B].\u000a      \u000aDrivers of support for fringe right parties mobilising against\u000a          immigrants and minorities. Ford and Goodwin have analysed the\u000a        historically unprecedented rise in voting for two `radical right'\u000a        parties (the BNP and UKIP), with support strongest amongst so-called\u000a        `angry white men' &#8212; white working class voters, anxious about the impact\u000a        of immigration and Islam, and disaffected with political elites who they\u000a        feel have ignored these concerns [D].\u000a      \u000aUnderstanding ethnic minority political behaviour. Research\u000a        undertaken by Heath and Sobolewska has developed a unique data source &#8212;\u000a        the Ethnic Minority British Election Survey (EMBES) &#8212; that provides the\u000a        largest and most detailed collection of information on the political\u000a        attitudes and choices of Britain's diverse minority communities. It\u000a        reveals that ethnic minorities in Britain are committed to participation\u000a        in formal British political processes and institutions, and for the\u000a        first time in the 2010 Election the gap in electoral participation\u000a        between minorities and the white majority had closed [C]. However,\u000a        several issues were noted: the under-registration of some ethnic groups;\u000a        the exclusion of minority concerns from the political agenda; and clear\u000a        evidence that minorities were much less likely to be contacted by the\u000a        political parties [A].\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28110","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pathways to Impact: Research findings have been widely\u000a      disseminated by the authors in both academic and non-academic settings;\u000a      the latter including an invited talk at the British Embassy in Athens. A\u000a      number of media engagements have also provided timely contributions, in\u000a      the context of Greece's ongoing economic and political turmoil. Since May\u000a      2010, Papadimitriou has made thirteen separate media appearances,\u000a      including: the BBC Breakfast show, discussing EU budget negotiations (24\u000a      November 2012); a radio interview on the BBC Five Live `Double Take'\u000a      programme, discussing the Greek crisis (20 May 2012); and an interview on\u000a      CBC Radio (Canada) on the Greek election (26 April 2012) [1]. Nonetheless,\u000a      the principal pathway to impact has been through direct engagement with\u000a      key political actors within the Greek executive.\u000a    Background: By illuminating the paradox of a constitutionally\u000a      powerful Prime Minister who lacks sufficient resources to effectively\u000a      coordinate government business, the research has had a major impact on\u000a      applied policy. As confirmed by the former Greek Minister of Finance: \"I\u000a        consider the collaborative research by Featherstone and Papadimitriou an\u000a        important example of policy-relevant academic work which has contributed\u000a        in a concrete manner to the re-thinking of government practices in\u000a        Greece\" [2]. More specifically, the work has directly shaped two new\u000a      laws on the operation of the Greek core executive, in 2011 and 2013, as\u000a      well as highlighting structural deficiencies at the centre of Greek\u000a      government. These latter observations are particularly important in the\u000a      context of the country's second EU `bailout package' in 2012 - in which\u000a      the strengthening of governance structures within the Greek core executive\u000a      became an explicit conditionality &#8212; and have attracted the attention of\u000a      Greece's international creditors.\u000a    Chronology of impact: On 14 March 2009 Papadimitriou and\u000a      Featherstone interviewed the then leader of the opposition (PASOK) in\u000a      Greece, George Papandreou, regarding his experiences as a senior minister\u000a      in previous governments. The interviewers elaborated on their argument\u000a      that a significant discrepancy existed between the formal powers afforded\u000a      to the Greek Prime Minister and the institutional resources available for\u000a      supporting coordination at the centre of government. Papandreou expressed\u000a      a strong interest in the findings of the project and asked both\u000a      interviewers for their support in reforming the system, later noting that:\u000a    \"I was very pleased that you joined our informal discussions on party\u000a        political reform in 2009, prior to my election victory. My colleagues\u000a        and I were already aware of your extensive research and academic work on\u000a        this theme, and your unique insight into the challenges of reforming the\u000a        Greek state's governance structures since the fall of the dictatorship\u000a        in 1974. Indeed, your observations concerning the long-term constraints\u000a        on the Prime Minister's office were consistent with my own thinking.\"\u000a      [3]\u000a    On 14 April 2009 Papadimitriou was invited to submit a blueprint\u000a      on reforming the Greek core executive to senior members of PASOK [4].\u000a      Those present at the meeting included Tina Birbili, Papandreou's senior\u000a      advisor and subsequent Minister of the Environment, and PASOK spokesperson\u000a      and subsequent Minister of Finance, George Papaconstantinou, who noted at\u000a      a previous meeting with Papadimitriou and Featherstone (9 February 2009)\u000a      that \"we agreed that it would be beneficial to implement some of these\u000a        ideas if PASOK won the forthcoming elections (October 2009)\" [2].\u000a      Papadimitriou promoted the idea of a stronger Office of the Prime Minister\u000a      and a larger (and permanent) General Secretariat of the Government headed\u000a      by a permanent civil servant, to improve the coordination of government\u000a      business. He argued that the institutionalisation of the then Greek `core\u000a      executive' was exceptionally weak compared to those of similar sized\u000a      countries across the European Union. The main thrust of his advice was\u000a      that Prime Ministerial oversight over disjointed `ministerial fiefdoms'\u000a      ought to be strengthened.\u000a    On 9 May 2009 Papadimitriou and Featherstone presented their main\u000a      argument on the weakness of the Greek core at a conference in Yale\u000a      University on the lack of public policy reform in Greece [5]. Based\u000a      on a wealth of primary material, the authors demonstrated the fragmented\u000a      nature and poor institutionalisation of the Greek core executive since the\u000a      country's transition to democracy in 1974. Their data conclusively\u000a      established that Greece stood as a clear outlier from the European\u000a      mainstream in the way in which core government business was managed.\u000a    On 30 September 2009, five days before the coming general\u000a      election, Papandreou and Professor Papadimitriou exchanged email messages\u000a      confirming the importance of strengthening the core executive. Papandreou\u000a      reiterated his wish for Papadimitriou to help with the reform of\u000a      government business [3]. On 4 October 2009, PASOK won the general\u000a      election, and Papandreou became Prime Minister.\u000a    In March 2010 George Papandreou established a 5-member\u000a      international advisory committee (comprising non-Greek academics and\u000a      senior policy makers) for reforming the Greek core executive. Featherstone\u000a      is appointed its Head and main rapporteur, and Papadimitriou is asked to\u000a      comment on each major draft of the recommendations. In September 2010 the\u000a      Advisory Committee submits its report. The main proposals, informed by\u000a      Papadimitriou and Featherstone's prior research, include the creation of a\u000a      new Ministry within the Office of the Prime Minister to help coordinate\u000a      government business. The Committee also advocates the creation of three\u000a      General Secretariats (GS): GS of the Prime Minister, GS of the Government\u000a      and GS of Human and Capital Resources [6].\u000a    IMPACT 1: On 19 January 2011 the Parliament votes on the\u000a      creation of a General Secretariat to the Prime Minister (Presidential\u000a      Decree 2, 11 January 2011) [7]. The bill that is presented to Parliament\u000a      includes the key aspects of the Committee's recommendations, including the\u000a      main organogram (albeit with fewer staff than originally envisaged by the\u000a      Committee) prepared by Featherstone and Papadimitriou. As Papandreou later\u000a      confirms: \"Your collaborative research... helped us to move forward\u000a        with this agenda, so that central government could exercise more\u000a        effective coordination of the work of the various ministries... Several\u000a        specific proposals to increase accountability and transparency in\u000a        government were adopted, leading to the introduction of new legislation\u000a        on government coordination... In short, your policy-led research has\u000a        made a concrete contribution to rethinking government practices in\u000a        Greece... I remain convinced that your diagnosis of the inherent\u000a        problems in Greece's governance system remains as relevant as ever\"\u000a      [3]. On 11 November 2011 Papandreou resigned as PM and was\u000a      replaced by Lucas Papademos. During the six month tenure of Papademos, the\u000a      structure of the core executive remained unaffected.\u000a    In January 2012, the OECD publishes its `Review on the Central\u000a      Administration in Greece', with Featherstone and Papadimitriou's work [A]\u000a      the only academic publication referenced. The report notes that: \"Although\u000a        there was, in principle, unprecedented convergence between the main\u000a        political parties on the country's reform agenda (Featherstone and\u000a        Papadimitriou, 2008), in practice the EMU's favourable economic and\u000a        financial conditions became opportunities to expand the state's umbrella\u000a        without showing too much concern for its inefficiencies. The result is a\u000a        public governance agenda in sore need of renewed momentum and of a clear\u000a        and complete strategic vision, to be rolled out without further delay\"\u000a      [8]. This was the first time that a major international organisation had\u000a      highlighted the weaknesses of the Greek core executive as a threat to the\u000a      sustainability of the country's governance structures.\u000a    On 9 March 2012 Greece signed its second bailout agreement with\u000a      the IMF. Amongst other conditions, the IMF demands that the Greek\u000a      government creates \"a directorate of planning, management, and\u000a        monitoring of reforms\" at the centre of government [9]. Similar\u000a      guidance was issued by Horst Reichenbach, the Head of the EU Task Force\u000a      for Greece (TFGR), the office set up for assisting administrative reform\u000a      in Greece. As TFGR confirm: \"Featherstone and Papadimitriou (2008) was\u000a        one of the information sources used by the TFGR to gain initial insights\u000a        on the functioning of the Greek administration. The book was\u000a        particularly useful to the TFGR as a complement to the OECD review...\u000a        While the OECD review provides a synthetic vision of the current\u000a        situation of the administration and recommendations for improvement, the\u000a        Featherstone and Papadimitriou book contains more detailed information,\u000a        such as for example the historic developments leading to the current\u000a        situation of the administration or about the relations between the\u000a        central and regional administration... The lack of central steering and\u000a        inter-ministerial coordination was mentioned as a major weakness of the\u000a        Greek Administration in both reports\" [8].\u000a    IMPACT 2: Following fresh general elections on 20 June 2012,\u000a      Antonis Samaras becomes Prime Minister, leading a `grand coalition'\u000a      between the centre-right New Democracy, centre-left PASOK and reformist\u000a      left DHMAR parties. In January 2013 the Parliament passed a new\u000a      law (4109, 23.1.2013) on the creation of a General Secretariat for the\u000a      Coordination of the Government, answerable directly to the Prime Minister.\u000a      The new service is staffed by 63 permanent civil servants, headed by a\u000a      Secretary General appointed on a 5-year term [10]. The provisions of the\u000a      new legislation are nearly identical to the recommendations by Professor\u000a      Papadimitriou back in April 2009 [4] and very close to the report by the\u000a      Advisory Team in September 2010 [6].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken at the University of Manchester (UoM) highlights how\u000a      limited resources and poor coordination at the heart of the Greek\u000a      government (the core executive) have circumscribed Prime Ministerial\u000a      authority and severely hampered the ability of successive governments to\u000a      develop and implement policy. This issue is particularly pressing, as many\u000a      of Greece's recent economic woes can be attributed to this weak `reform\u000a      capacity'. The research had a direct impact by changing party policy and\u000a      informing the drafting of two new laws on restructuring the Greek core\u000a      executive, in 2011 and 2013 respectively. These changes have survived the\u000a      turnover of two different governments.

The groundwork for the impact is\u000a      contained within a co-written publication, later translated into Greek,\u000a      that identified the key features of Greece's political economy that\u000a      restrict its capacity to adjust to demands emanating from its EU and\u000a      Eurozone membership [C]. This led, in 2009, to the authors seeking to\u000a      relate Greece's `reform capacity' with the more institutional features of\u000a      the country's `core executive'; in particular, the position of Prime\u000a      Ministerial leadership within it. This research has produced a number of\u000a      conference papers, stakeholder presentations and academic publications\u000a      [A][B], and will culminate in the publication of a major new book in early\u000a      2014.\u000a    The research highlights the problem of poor management at the heart of\u000a        the Greek core executive. This was recognised well before the\u000a      country's governance structures came under international scrutiny in the\u000a      context of the Eurozone debt crisis, although the issues identified have\u000a      become increasingly pertinent in explaining how Greece's current\u000a      predicament is not simply the result of economic mismanagement, but is\u000a      also rooted in entrenched public policy weaknesses that have built up over\u000a      a number of decades. In particular, a weak `reform capacity' was\u000a      highlighted, in an assessment that went beyond any formal interpretation\u000a      of the Greek constitution. Thus in contrast to the view, widely held by\u000a      legal scholars, that the Greek Prime Minister is Primus Solus\u000a      within the core executive, and can therefore assume almost unchallenged\u000a      dominance, the research demonstrated that the Greek core executive suffers\u000a      from a number of deficiencies: exceptionally weak institutionalisation; a\u000a      lack of resources and mechanisms to ensure effective oversight and\u000a      coordination between individual ministers; and a lack of capacity to\u000a      effectively develop and implement policy.\u000a    The research entailed repeated in-depth interviews with all surviving\u000a        Greek Prime Ministers (four out of six post holders since the\u000a      country's transition to democracy in 1974) alongside all six Chiefs of\u000a      Staff who served the Greek Prime Minister's Office during this period.\u000a      This represented the first time that such high profile contributions have\u000a      informed an academic work on Greek public policy. In addition,\u000a      Papadimitriou and Featherstone also conducted over 60 semi-structured\u000a      interviews with members of the Cabinet, advisers in the Prime Minister's\u000a      Office and senior civil servants at the heart of the Greek government. The\u000a      project also consulted over 300 legislative acts and a large dataset of\u000a      other primary sources, such as newspaper reports and policy documents, to\u000a      construct a retrospective picture of the Greek core executive, and the\u000a      changing balance of power within it over the past forty years.\u000a    The paradox of strong formal (constitutional) powers, but few actual\u000a      resources at the disposal of the Greek Prime Minister, was explored in an\u000a      article in Governance [A]. Focusing on the four main Prime\u000a      Ministerial tenures of the past 40 years, the authors analysed key reform\u000a      initiatives aimed at strengthening cohesion within the Greek core\u000a      executive, identifying that none of the reforms succeeded in breaking the\u000a      pattern of weak institutionalisation, limited resources and relative Prime\u000a      Ministerial isolation in the policy cycle. The analysis went deeper than a\u000a      mere consideration of individual management styles or short-term political\u000a      party-political calculations, focusing instead on a wider set of features\u000a      present within Greek political culture, and evident even in the highest\u000a      echelons of Greece's political personnel, in which `personalism' based on\u000a      trust, informality and closed networks of power attract a high premium.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28156","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pathways to Impact: Sustained and productive relationships with\u000a      research users have been cultivated at the highest levels.

Annesley was the national expert (UK) for the EU `Expert\u000a      Group on Gender Equality and Social Inclusion, Health and Long-Term Care\u000a      Issues' (EGGSI), producing eight reports (2008-2012) [3].

Together, these engagements, at the\u000a      interface of research, advocacy and policy, have ensured broad\u000a      participation across the social scale (Opposition MPs, the media,\u000a      grassroots feminist groups and vulnerable citizens). Critically, those\u000a      most at risk have been aided &#8212; through targeted interventions &#8212; to\u000a      apprehend and recognise the injurious nature of austerity measures, and\u000a      afforded tools to campaign against them.\u000a    Impact 1: UoM research has shaped proposals on how to improve\u000a        political diversity.\u000a      Recommendations on how local authorities can support efforts to increase\u000a      representative diversity in local government were taken up by the Roberts\u000a          Commission (the `Councillors Commission') and informed the key\u000a      recommendation that all local authorities should have a statutory duty to\u000a      promote democracy &#8212; a recommendation translated into a commitment within\u000a      the White Paper `Communities in Control Real People, Real Power' (2008).\u000a      The ensuing `Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act'\u000a      (2009) included this provision as a new `duty to promote democracy'. The\u000a      Chair confirms this chain of events: \"The Commission utilised\u000a        recommendations from the ELG report that suggested local authorities\u000a        should support efforts to increase representative diversity in local\u000a        government... Although this duty was subsequently repealed by the\u000a        Coalition Government, it is notable that ELG research still informs\u000a        policy debate on this issue. For example, University of Manchester\u000a        research was cited at a recent Communities and Local Government Select\u000a        Committee enquiry into `Councillors and the Community' (2012) where\u000a        evidence from the University of Manchester's Liz Richardson... cited\u000a        both ELG research, and the work of the Roberts Commission, in support of\u000a        measures to encourage renewed local authority involvement in improving\u000a        the diversity of councillor representation ...

In my view, robust research\u000a        and evidence of this nature is crucial in order to inform the policy\u000a        debate on local government and democracy more widely\" [5].\u000a    This research agenda was taken forward by Gains and Richardson in work\u000a      for the EHRC, which followed the final report of the\u000a      `Speakers Conference on Parliamentary Representation' (2010) &#8212; with\u000a      research findings fed back to committee members [D]. This is confirmed by\u000a      the EHRC's Research Manager, who also adds that the research was later\u000a      cited in EHRC publications, utilised in evidence to the Office for\u000a      Disability Issues, and \"knowledge of the issues raised in the report\u000a        helped inform the focus of the section of `Women in public life' in the\u000a        recent EHRC treaty submissions to the UN Committee on the Elimination of\u000a        all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)... the report has been\u000a        of value. Overall it has contributed to both policy and research\".\u000a      The report has also been utilised by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty\u000a      Commission (an NDPB chaired by Alan Milburn) and the Government Equalities\u000a      Office. Latterly, it was cited in the influential 2013 `Sex and Power'\u000a      report, produced by a coalition of NGOs, with the report picked up by the\u000a      Observer, with Annesley quoted directly [2].\u000a    Impact 2: UoM research has contributed to ongoing work by the Women's\u000a          Budget Group (WBG) concerning the gendered impact of the\u000a        Government's austerity programme. The scope of the research has thus\u000a      widened to consider, concomitantly, the gendered implications of public\u000a      policy. Under the auspices of the WBG, Annesley took the lead in\u000a      formulating and writing the WBG response to the `Comprehensive Spending\u000a      Reviews' (2010, 2013) and the `Autumn Financial Statement' (2011);\u000a      contributing to several other outputs. Likewise, Annesley contributed to\u000a      an Observer editorial which argued that \"According to campaigning\u000a        groups the Fawcett Society and the Women's Budget Group, more than 70%\u000a        of the &#163;18bn cuts to social security and welfare will fall on women....\u000a        For all its failings, Labour understood the way in which targeted\u000a        support &#8212; tax credits, child benefit, childcare subsidy and jobs growth\u000a        in the public sector &#8212; benefited women, helped to reduce child poverty\u000a        and stimulated the economy\". As the WBG chair confirms: \"these\u000a        contributions have been important in keeping the gender equality impacts\u000a        of fiscal policy on the agenda of government departments, public bodies\u000a        and women's organizations... The analysis of the 2010 spending review\u000a        was submitted in evidence to the formal investigation of this Review...\u000a        and positive reference was made to this evidence in the report that the\u000a      [Equalities and Human Rights] Commission issued in May 2012. As a\u000a        result the government accepted that Budgets and Spending Reviews must be\u000a        accompanied by an Equalities Impact Assessment\". Following this\u000a      breakthrough, Annesley continues to assist the WBG in monitoring and\u000a      suggesting refinements to these impact assessments, working closely with\u000a      the EHRC. This impact has also been bolstered through ongoing engagement\u000a      with the media; Annesley co-writing a policy briefing on the gendered\u000a      impact of Universal Credit for the WBG, which was published as an LSE\u000a      blog. Significantly, this was picked up (and linked to) by Observer\u000a      journalist Nick Cohen whose article states: \"The benefit changes have\u000a        been designed to `reinforce the traditional male breadwinner model', in\u000a        the words of the Women's Budget Group, an alliance of academics and\u000a        trade unionists, which fights a determined, if often hopeless, battle to\u000a        defend poor and working-class women. Reinforce the patriarchal male and,\u000a        inevitably, you restrict women's independence\" [4].\u000a    Impact 3: UoM research has informed the policy of Her\u000a          Majesty's Opposition. As awareness has grown regarding the\u000a      gendered impact of austerity policies on women, increased traction has\u000a      emerged within policy circles. Annesley has twice been invited to present\u000a      research to the Women's Parliamentary Labour Party (WPLP) (22nd\u000a      November 2011 &amp; 12th March 2013) and to a group convened by\u000a      Yvette Cooper MP (Shadow Minister for Women and Equalities) and Kate Green\u000a      MP (Chair, WPLP). Green also sought Annesley's advice on a one-to-one\u000a      basis, confirming that: \"these presentations have proved very valuable\u000a        in enabling women politicians to make an evidenced case for more\u000a        gender-sensitive policy, and to mount an informed challenge to Coalition\u000a        policies... The Parliamentary Labour Party has also made extensive and\u000a        ongoing use of Professor Annesley's research, as it continues to:\u000a        challenge ministers, via parliamentary questions; evaluate spending\u000a        announcements; and highlight the gender blindness of government... I\u000a        hope she will also be able to assist in assessing the gender impact of\u000a        Labour's own policy proposals as we develop our election manifesto\".\u000a      This was confirmed, as following the second WPLP presentation Annesley was\u000a      contacted by Yvette Cooper's office, requesting additional information on\u000a      the gendered aspects of underemployment and casualisation, as they were \"putting\u000a        together some briefings for Women and Equalities Questions in the\u000a        chamber after Easter and [...] these figures could provide an\u000a        interesting basis.\" This ongoing dialogue has also led to UoM\u000a      research on the topic of women's representation being publicly revisited,\u000a      most notably within two North West Young Labour (NWYL) policy forums\u000a      (Manchester, December 2012 &amp; Warrington, January 2013). The policy\u000a      document produced (with a foreword by Kate Green,) will inform the Labour\u000a      Party's National Policy Review. Annesley's contribution is cited directly,\u000a      noting that she \"made a forceful case for increased female\u000a        representation in government. With a stark lack of women in the vital\u000a        departments like the Treasury, Work &amp; Pensions or `The Quad'... we\u000a        agreed that Labour should have the courage to commit to at least 50% of\u000a        the Cabinet and Government Ministers being women. We should also take\u000a        similar steps in Council executives\" [6].\u000a    Impact 4: UoM research has empowered people affected by Coalition cuts\u000a        through knowledge transfer. Ongoing engagement has been carefully\u000a      targeted in order to uphold the key messages emerging from UoM research.\u000a      For instance, Annesley was invited to present analysis on the gendered\u000a      impact of the Coalition's economic policies to the `All Party\u000a      Parliamentary Group for Sex Equality' (26th October 2010), and\u000a      was invited by BBC Radio 4 `Woman's Hour' to lead a discussion on the\u000a      impact of coalition cuts on women (11th May 2011) [7]. Other\u000a      forms of outreach have been similarly tailored, and as Kate Green MP &#8212; who\u000a      has shared a platform with Annesley at numerous events &#8212; notes, her\u000a      contributions \"helped to inform, politicise and empower the women,\u000a        many of whom have gone on to speak out in their own communities,\u000a        workplaces and in the media\" [6]. Specific examples include the\u000a      presentation of research to: WomenMATTA (Manchester and Trafford Taking\u000a      Action) (20th July 2010); Independent Choices &#8212; a Manchester\u000a      advocacy group for victims of domestic abuse (1st December\u000a      2010); the `Hard Times' conference to 170 grassroots women in Sheffield\u000a      (18th April 2011); an LSE public event on austerity (11th\u000a      May 2011) [8]; a Unison fringe meeting in Manchester (19th June\u000a      2011) [22]; and the TUC women's conference in Liverpool (18th\u000a      November 2011). One of the co-organisers of the Hard Times\u000a          Conference, noted shortly afterwards that Annesley's \"presentation\u000a        topped the 'star' stakes in the sense of the number of people who\u000a        expressed special appreciation of her talk in the 'feedback' sheets....\"\u000a      She later commented that: \"Annesley spoke in the plenary debate with\u000a        great clarity and authority about the impact the austerity measures\u000a        recently announced might have on the middle to lower earnings population\u000a        and particularly on women... The conference with its wide audience was\u000a        important in strengthening a commitment to the importance of better\u000a        gender analysis of the impact of new policies, and the significant role\u000a        universities can play in ensuring the gender duty placed on public\u000a        authorities by the Equalities legislation is well grounded in evidence\"\u000a      [9]. On the back of these engagements, Annesley has recently undertaken\u000a      similar dissemination in both a Scottish context, and at a `UN Women\u000a      workshop of local civil society groups' held in in Macedonia (October\u000a      2012) where her contribution \"inspired CSO discussion on national and\u000a        regional networking through the production of joint policy\/budget\u000a        watchdog reports\" [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The underrepresentation of women in political life, gender equality in\u000a      policy making and the relationship between gender representation and\u000a      gender equality, are considered in parallel within research undertaken at\u000a      the University of Manchester (UoM). The work has informed Labour\u000a      Government commitments to promote diversity of representation in local and\u000a      national government, and more recently has underscored the detrimental\u000a      impact of the Coalition Government's austerity policies; informing the\u000a      Opposition Labour Party, contributing to public debate and empowering\u000a      those most harshly affected. Explicit policy impact can be seen in two\u000a      domains. Firstly, the `Duty to Promote Democracy', introduced via Statute\u000a      in 2009. Secondly, following the `Speakers Conference on Parliamentary\u000a      Representation' (2010), research for the Equality and Human Rights\u000a      Commission (EHRC) on diversity in Parliament, that continues to inform\u000a      policy debate.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    The University of Manchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Manchester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007798}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2643123","Name":"Manchester"},{"GeoNamesId":"2638077","Name":"Sheffield"},{"GeoNamesId":"2634739","Name":"Warrington"},{"GeoNamesId":"2644210","Name":"Liverpool"}],"References":"\u000a    (all references available upon request &#8212; AUR)\u000a    The research has been published in peer reviewed journals, and\u000a      influential policy reports\u000a    \u000a[A] (2013) Annesley, C. &amp; Gains, F. \"Investigating the Economic\u000a      Determinants of the UK Gender Equality Policy Agenda\" British Journal\u000a        of Politics and International Relations 15(1) 125-146 (REF 2014)\u000a      doi:10.1111\/j.1467-856X.2011.00492.x\u000a    \u000a\u000a[B] (2011) Durose, C., Gains, F., Richardson, L., et al `Pathways\u000a      to Politics: Equality and Human Rights Commission Research Report 65'\u000a      (Manchester: EHRC) (AUR)\u000a    \u000a\u000a[C] (2011) Annesley, C. &amp; Scheele, A. \"Gender, Capitalism and\u000a      Economic Crisis: Impact and Responses\" Journal of Contemporary\u000a        European Studies 19(3) 335-347 doi:10.1080\/14782804.2011.610604\u000a    \u000a\u000a[D] (2010) Annesley, C. &amp; Gains, F. \"The Core Executive: Gender Power\u000a      and Change\" Political Studies 58(5) 909-929 (REF 2014)\u000a      doi:10.1111\/j.1467-9248.2010.00824.x\u000a    \u000a\u000a[E] (2007) John, P, Gains, F., Goodwin, M., Richardson, L., Rao, N. &amp;\u000a      Evans, E. `Improving the Representativeness of Councillors: Learning from\u000a      Five High Performing Local Authorities in England' (London: DCLG) (AUR)\u000a    \u000a","ResearchSubjectAreas":[{"Level1":"16","Level2":"99","Subject":"Other Studies In Human Society"},{"Level1":"16","Level2":"5","Subject":"Policy and Administration"},{"Level1":"16","Level2":"6","Subject":"Political Science"}],"Sources":"\u000a    (all claims referenced in the text)\u000a    [1] Email from DGLG to Peter John (18th July 2007)\u000a    [2] EHRC: Testimonial from Research Manager, EHRC (29th\u000a      July 2013); Email from Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission to\u000a      Durose (12th July 2013); (2013) Centre for Women and Democracy\u000a      `Counting Women In &#8212; Sex and Power 2013: Who runs Britain?'

The research found no improvement in the diversity of representation\u000a      in local government despite hopes that new constitutional arrangements,\u000a      first introduced in the Local Government Act (2000), would encourage a\u000a      more diverse group of aspirant candidates. Diversity in national\u000a      institutions was again considered in the EHRC report `Pathways to\u000a      Politics...', which addressed the relationship between common routes into\u000a      politics and the under-representation of groups protected by the Equality\u000a      Act (2010) [B].\u000a    (2) Gender and the Core Executive: Research on New Labour policies\u000a      revealed that women's presence in the core executive is necessary for\u000a      substantive policy progress towards gender equality; mere parliamentary\u000a      presence is not enough. Furthermore, a range of both formal and informal\u000a      barriers remain (such as exclusion from unofficial networks) preventing\u000a      women's equal access and progress in politics [D]. A subsequent analysis\u000a      of Coalition Government policies suggests that an absence of women across\u000a      key areas, alongside the low status of gender equality machineries as part\u000a      of the solution(s) to the global financial crisis, can be specifically\u000a      pinpointed as contributory factors in the stalling and reversal of\u000a      equality gains [A]. The research also highlighted how policies promoting\u000a      gender equality are more likely to form a part of government agendas when\u000a      the economy is growing. In periods of recession, gender equality tends\u000a      only to be pursued as a result of pressures from `outside' (e.g. at the EU\u000a      level) [C].\u000a    (3) The Gendered Consequences of Public Policy: Recent research\u000a      has critically analysed how policy outputs are gendered, both under the\u000a      more favourable environment associated with New Labour Governments and\u000a      under the more hostile climate associated with the current Coalition\u000a      Government. Since 2010, UoM research has offered detailed analyses of the\u000a      detrimental impacts that the current Coalition Government's policies to\u000a      tackle the public deficit are having on women. This is seen in terms of\u000a      three factors: how women's incomes, from social security and wages, are\u000a      being reduced; how unemployment is affecting men and women; and the effect\u000a      of public service cuts and restructuring on women as primary users. The\u000a      research clearly identifies a major reversal of equality gains made over\u000a      the preceding years [C].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30205","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Williams combined engagements with media and policy users and formal\u000d\u000a      advisory roles to\u000d\u000a      establish a powerful profile conducive to achieving impact.

Williams's\u000d\u000a      efforts produced an emergent\u000d\u000a      dynamic, where, for example, his Guardian writings led to\u000d\u000a      invitations for television appearances,\u000d\u000a      and his presence in public debate attracted the attention of policymakers\u000d\u000a      who requested his\u000d\u000a      involvement in their deliberations with invitations, for example, to\u000d\u000a      provide parliamentary testimony\u000d\u000a      and to engage in policy discussions with party officials.\u000d\u000a    Williams's research and expertise led to his inclusion in international\u000d\u000a      policy-planning exercises and\u000d\u000a      consultative assignments with the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs\u000d\u000a      and International Trade,\u000d\u000a      NATO Allied Command Transformation, the US Joint Forces Command, the UK\u000d\u000a      Foreign and\u000d\u000a      Commonwealth Office, the UK Ministry of Defence and the House of Commons\u000d\u000a      Defence Select\u000d\u000a      Committee. He was selected three times as a `transatlantic opinion leader'\u000d\u000a      by NATO, and taken on\u000d\u000a      select trips in 2006, 2008 and 2012 to the mission in Afghanistan.\u000d\u000a      Williams was selected because\u000d\u000a      of the influence of his research and media work on NATO policy, and the\u000d\u000a      trips were designed to\u000d\u000a      allow NATO policymakers to garner external analysis and to `red team' NATO\u000d\u000a      operations. The\u000d\u000a      visits also facilitated Williams's research by putting him in contact with\u000d\u000a      key officials on the ground,\u000d\u000a      and allowed him to feed back further recommendations to NATO HQ. Williams\u000d\u000a      was also named to\u000d\u000a      the Media Advisory Group of the Ministry of Defence in recognition of the\u000d\u000a      impact of his analysis for\u000d\u000a      international news outlets on public opinion. He provided briefings for\u000d\u000a      the senior leadership of the\u000d\u000a      Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour Parties. His work has been\u000d\u000a      requested for official\u000d\u000a      parliamentary inquiries and was subsequently published by Parliament.\u000d\u000a      Williams served as a\u000d\u000a      foreign policy advisor Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, specifically advising\u000d\u000a      on NATO's role in\u000d\u000a      Afghanistan. He co-authored the campaign's official policy paper on\u000d\u000a      Afghanistan with Barney\u000d\u000a      Rubin (NYU) and Seth Jones (RAND).\u000d\u000a    Williams's research has had particular impact on three users during the\u000d\u000a      REF period.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aUK Labour Party defence policy. Williams made specific\u000d\u000a        contributions to the official\u000d\u000a        Opposition's Shadow Defence Review from 2012 to 2013, whose work will\u000d\u000a        feed into a 2014\u000d\u000a        White Paper on Labour's defence and security strategy that will underpin\u000d\u000a        its 2015 manifesto\u000d\u000a        stance. He attended three roundtable discussions and advised the Labour\u000d\u000a        team on issues\u000d\u000a        including the UK's nuclear posture, the regional sources of likely\u000d\u000a        future threats, the principles\u000d\u000a        that should shape UK counter-terror strategies overseas and future force\u000d\u000a        structure. The\u000d\u000a        Shadow Secretary of State for Defence recognised the important ways in\u000d\u000a        which Williams's\u000d\u000a        close collaboration with practitioners and officials in both the West\u000d\u000a        and in Afghanistan\u000d\u000a        informed his research, noting that he `has a breadth of knowledge which\u000d\u000a        is vital and valuable\u000d\u000a        for our work and in each discussion he has provided the group with\u000d\u000a        specific insights from his\u000d\u000a        work overseas, in particular from his knowledge of US policy-making in\u000d\u000a        the security field'. The\u000d\u000a        Shadow Secretary further confirmed: `The impact of Mike's contribution\u000d\u000a        has been to identify\u000d\u000a        the areas which the Shadow Defence Team must consider and research in\u000d\u000a        detail in order to\u000d\u000a        produce a meaningful White Paper, and to provide specific policy ideas\u000d\u000a        which we will reflect\u000d\u000a        on as we develop our platform'. He also highlighted specific policy\u000d\u000a        ideas Williams helped\u000d\u000a        Labour assess, including `how to define UK strategic interests overseas,\u000d\u000a        a key element of our\u000d\u000a        consultation paper, and...how the UK should respond to the threat of\u000d\u000a        militancy in North and\u000d\u000a        West Africa, which has helped Labour to develop a position which is\u000d\u000a        distinct from that of the\u000d\u000a        UK Government'. He affirmed that Williams's work on defence and\u000d\u000a        restructuring `will feed in\u000d\u000a        to our White Paper'. Williams also edited the final version the Shadow\u000d\u000a        Secretary's speech to\u000d\u000a        the Henry Jackson Society (10 July 2012) that discussed the ethics and\u000d\u000a        norms of\u000d\u000a        international humanitarian intervention undertaken by NATO and other\u000d\u000a        organisations.\u000d\u000a      \u000aGerman Parliamentary State Secretary for Defence and Cassidian\u000d\u000a          (Airbus Military).\u000d\u000a        Through his Bosch Fellowship, Williams worked on a series of projects in\u000d\u000a        the German\u000d\u000a        Ministry of Defence, advising the Parliamentary State Secretary on\u000d\u000a        Afghan National Army\u000d\u000a        (ANA) developments and producing a report identifying ways that Germany\u000d\u000a        can influence\u000d\u000a        better European defence coordination despite the pressures of European\u000d\u000a        austerity measures.\u000d\u000a        He carried out a briefing on the strategic situation in Afghanistan for\u000d\u000a        the Secretary, providing\u000d\u000a        him with information to question the German High Representative for\u000d\u000a        Afghanistan on his\u000d\u000a        presentation of the situation on the ground. The Bosch Fellowship also\u000d\u000a        gave Williams the\u000d\u000a        opportunity to work for Cassidian in their Future Concepts Division,\u000d\u000a        providing strategic insight\u000d\u000a        and recommendations to the CEO and Board of Directors on issues relevant\u000d\u000a        to the\u000d\u000a        organisation's future business plans. Williams advised on whether\u000d\u000a        Cassidian should pursue\u000d\u000a        transatlantic versus European-only projects. The company was at the time\u000d\u000a        focussed on\u000d\u000a        mainly transatlantic relations. Williams supported continuing this but\u000d\u000a        advised that a\u000d\u000a        dedicated focus on joint European projects was also needed. Cassidian is\u000d\u000a        now in the process\u000d\u000a        of restructuring to focus on increasing in-house capacity so as not be\u000d\u000a        as reliant on US\u000d\u000a        manufacturers (and therefore also US politicians).\u000d\u000a      \u000aNATO Policy Makers &#8212; Emerging Security Challenges and Operations.\u000d\u000a        Williams' work\u000d\u000a        was utilised extensively by NATO HQ in Brussels and NATO Allied Command\u000d\u000a        Transformation\u000d\u000a        in Norfolk, VA. His research on civil-military relations in Afghanistan\u000d\u000a        provided NATO with\u000d\u000a        critical analysis of current operations and influenced the development\u000d\u000a        of future NATO\u000d\u000a        doctrine and policy. NATO has undertaken a process of developing a new\u000d\u000a        strategic concept\u000d\u000a        and new operational framework, and Williams has been involved since 2006\u000d\u000a        in the\u000d\u000a        discussions and deliberations of this process. He was originally\u000d\u000a        contracted by NATO Allied\u000d\u000a        Command Transformation in Norfolk in 2006 (with US Joint Forces\u000d\u000a        Command), 2007 and\u000d\u000a        2008 to conduct various studies on security environment, on the impact\u000d\u000a        of emerging security\u000d\u000a        challenges on the organisation and on alliance cohesion. He has\u000d\u000a        subsequently continued to\u000d\u000a        work with the Office of the Secretary General, Office of Policy Planning\u000d\u000a        and Office of\u000d\u000a        Emerging Security Challenges to help frame the debate and provide\u000d\u000a        foundation documents\u000d\u000a        for review by allied states to assist in their development of a new\u000d\u000a        strategic concept. The 2012\u000d\u000a        trip to Afghanistan was in relation to this work. The Press Officer for\u000d\u000a        the Public Diplomacy\u000d\u000a        Division of NATO HQ said of Williams's tours of Afghanistan and his\u000d\u000a        subsequent advice that\u000d\u000a        he `provided highly valuable insight and analysis on a wide range of\u000d\u000a        issues, ranging from the\u000d\u000a        tactical aspects of counter-insurgency operations, the Afghan-Pakistani\u000d\u000a        interplay, the\u000d\u000a        development of civil-military relations, NATO's cooperation with other\u000d\u000a        international\u000d\u000a        organizations within the comprehensive approach construct and the\u000d\u000a        Atlantic\u000d\u000a        Alliance's partnerships with Central Asian Republics and Russia'. The\u000d\u000a        Press Officer also\u000d\u000a        noted Williams's role in a number of important outreach initiatives\u000d\u000a        based on the findings of\u000d\u000a        the tours. The NATO Assistant Secretary General for Emerging Security\u000d\u000a        Challenges confirms\u000d\u000a        that the work of the Carnegie Corporation funded project to which\u000d\u000a        Williams contributed had a\u000d\u000a        direct impact on NATO discussions and thinking on future civil-military\u000d\u000a        policy. He also\u000d\u000a        affirmed the value of the feedback Williams provided from his three\u000d\u000a        trips to Afghanistan and\u000d\u000a        that Williams's `work on the interface between military forces, civilian\u000d\u000a        diplomats and civilian\u000d\u000a        non-governmental workers, has helped develop a better common\u000d\u000a        understanding of the\u000d\u000a        mutual interests and different operating procedures of these\u000d\u000a        organizations' and `provided\u000d\u000a        insight into how NATO policy-makers should think about these challenges\u000d\u000a        and how the\u000d\u000a        Alliance might respond to similar challenges in the future'. The\u000d\u000a        Assistant Secretary General\u000d\u000a        further maintained that `Michael Williams's work has certainly been\u000d\u000a        beneficial and influential\u000d\u000a        to [NATO's] thinking'.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study refers to the REF-period impact achieved by Michael J.\u000d\u000a      Williams, who joined the\u000d\u000a      Unit in 2008.

The\u000d\u000a        risk society thesis proposes that the move from modernity into late and\u000d\u000a        post-modernity\u000d\u000a        compels the evolution of a society's views of security from a reactive\u000d\u000a        stance towards a more\u000d\u000a        proactive position. Consequently, NATO's original security rationale,\u000d\u000a        predicated on the\u000d\u000a        defence against communism, had to be adapted to encompass new, more\u000d\u000a        amorphously\u000d\u000a        defined security risks such as `terrorism' and `climate change'.\u000d\u000a        Williams's theoretical\u000d\u000a        contribution not only accounts for how and why NATO survived the end of\u000d\u000a        the Cold War, but\u000d\u000a        also indicates the reasons for its development over the subsequent 20\u000d\u000a        years. Beyond the\u000d\u000a        academy this research has implications for policy-makers dealing with\u000d\u000a        the development of\u000d\u000a        security and foreign policies at the strategic level.\u000d\u000a      \u000aCivil-Military Relations in Post-Conflict Reconstruction: This\u000d\u000a        applied research explored\u000d\u000a        the relationship between civilian government, civilian non-governmental\u000d\u000a        actors and military\u000d\u000a        forces in conflict zones, with Williams's field research focusing on\u000d\u000a        Afghanistan. It relates to\u000d\u000a        the first strand in that it speaks to NATO's evolution into a proactive\u000d\u000a        security risk manager via\u000d\u000a        the war in Kosovo and more recently its mission in Afghanistan. A chief\u000d\u000a        obstacle facing\u000d\u000a        NATO has been how to provide `security' in an Afghan context where the\u000d\u000a        traditional equation\u000d\u000a        of military power with security, which envisions security in terms of\u000d\u000a        freedom from invasion or\u000d\u000a        subjugation by a foreign power, has become problematic. Williams's\u000d\u000a        research demonstrates\u000d\u000a        how security in Afghanistan must be embedded in a development agenda\u000d\u000a        aiming to provide\u000d\u000a        `human security' by improving health care, education and justice\u000d\u000a        systems.

Linguamatics was able to move from data mining medical journal\u000d\u000a      texts to mining public social media data and thereby enter public opinion\u000d\u000a      research. It won a patent on its text analysis software I2E. On 14\u000d\u000a      September 2009 O'Loughlin convened a semantic polling event featuring\u000d\u000a      presentations by the FCO, the private company, Information Options, and\u000d\u000a      the activist\/marketing group, We Are Social, and attended by Oxfam, DSTL,\u000d\u000a      YouGov, the BBC and the European Commission.\u000d\u000a    O'Loughlin's research both stimulated debate and changed the practice of\u000d\u000a      organisations. His work with Linguamatics in 2008 and from 2009 with Nick\u000d\u000a      Anstead (a former PhD student in O'Loughlin's New Political Communication\u000d\u000a      Unit and now a Lecturer at LSE) engaged practitioners during the research\u000d\u000a      process and led to a Hansard launch event of Anstead\/O'Loughlin's policy\u000d\u000a      brief on 5 July 2012, with attendees from the BBC, Department of Culture,\u000d\u000a      Media and Sport, pollsters Ipsos-Mori, Angus Reid, YouGov, ComRes,\u000d\u000a      Tweetminster and the British Polling Council, and semantic polling\u000d\u000a      companies Linguamatics and Semiocast. O'Loughlin and Anstead later\u000d\u000a      presented on the implications of semantic polling for citizens' social\u000d\u000a      media use and its regulation at a 17 May 2013 OFCOM event, `Adult Media\u000d\u000a      Use and Literacy'. The Council of Europe invited O'Loughlin to give\u000d\u000a      evidence on developments on the internet and politics in March 2013. Based\u000d\u000a      on that presentation, the Council decided to instigate a debate about\u000d\u000a      semantic polling at the November 2013 World Forum for Democracy and it\u000d\u000a      will feature in the Council's December 2013 final report.\u000d\u000a    O'Loughlin's expertise in semantic polling led to an invitation from BBC\u000d\u000a      World Service (BBCWS) to conduct social media analysis of audience\u000d\u000a      responses to the 2012 London Olympics, in collaboration with Marie\u000d\u000a      Gillespie (Open University). This work has impacted upon editorial policy\u000d\u000a      and the BBC's audience research practice. The BBC had already conducted\u000d\u000a      sentiment analysis and basic network analysis, but the BBC Trust's remit\u000d\u000a      requires it to find ways to measure `buzz', `reach' and `the global\u000d\u000a      conversation'. This required greater conceptual clarity and methodological\u000d\u000a      innovation, and O'Loughlin and Gillespie's research of English, Persian,\u000d\u000a      Russian and Arabic audiences contributed to this by delineating the role\u000d\u000a      of identity and community in generating various affective and cognitive\u000d\u000a      responses. O'Loughlin and Gillespie were invited to present their report\u000d\u000a      for the BBCWS at the main international industry gathering, CIBAR\u000d\u000a      (Conference of International Audience Researchers), in November 2012 in\u000d\u000a      Salford.\u000d\u000a    Tweeting the Olympics helped BBCWS reshape its editorial and social media\u000d\u000a      strategies for future global events. The BBCWS Head of Audiences said, `It\u000d\u000a      was useful to pinpoint what exactly was good and what was less so and work\u000d\u000a      on improvements for similar events in the future', and that the research\u000d\u000a      would `help inform further social media activity across the language\u000d\u000a      services'.\u000d\u000a    The impact of O'Loughlin's earlier research on how online conversation\u000d\u000a      moves during events was evident in a statement by the BBCWS Digital\u000d\u000a      Insight manager, who said, `For me the most important take out was about\u000d\u000a      how the conversation morphed throughout an event &#8212; from the emotional, to\u000d\u000a      the informational and finally to the contextual. The fact that the former\u000d\u000a      types of conversation were the most dominant in the twittersphere was\u000d\u000a      really important to us &#8212; as it's not something we really engage with at\u000d\u000a      the moment (focussing more on the contextual) and raises the very\u000d\u000a      important question as to whether we need to engage with these types of\u000d\u000a      conversations more in order to take social users with us into the journey\u000d\u000a      towards more analytical content'. The manager also confirmed that these\u000d\u000a      findings were fed into editorial policy: `This has been something we've\u000d\u000a      discussed with senior management and is now being used by us to help us in\u000d\u000a      our ongoing social listening activity and is acting as a loose framework\u000d\u000a      to help us better analyse social conversation'. The impact of the semantic\u000d\u000a      polling methodology was evidenced by feedback from the BBC Global News\u000d\u000a      Online Journalism &amp; Innovation Editor, who said: `The research\u000d\u000a      methodology in combining scientific computational calculations with human\u000d\u000a      coding is unique and offered useful insights [into] qualitative and\u000d\u000a      quantitative analysis. The research and the findings highlighted the need\u000d\u000a      to have proper social media staffing when covering big events. It was also\u000d\u000a      useful in comparing two different approached to using twitter in covering\u000d\u000a      big events: Automated module VS. Live tweeting combined with live pages'.\u000d\u000a      He further confirmed that, `I have included the lessons learnt from this\u000d\u000a      research in my social media strategy for BBC Arabic'.\u000d\u000a    O'Loughlin's work on strategic narratives and public diplomacy\u000d\u000a      was recognised as early as 2008 when he was asked to contribute to an 18\u000d\u000a      May 2008 New York Times article on Russia's development of the\u000d\u000a      English-language news channel Russia Today to promote its image abroad.\u000d\u000a      However, the most direct impact of O'Loughlin's work is demonstrated in\u000d\u000a      his role as Specialist Advisor to the House of Lords Select Committee on\u000d\u000a      Soft Power and the UK's Influence from July 2013. O'Loughlin advises on\u000d\u000a      the selection of witnesses from politics, business and culture who are\u000d\u000a      invited to give evidence, on the questions they are asked, and on how\u000d\u000a      written evidence is interpreted. The Committee Clerk has written that\u000d\u000a      O'Loughlin's `knowledge of academic debates around strategic narratives\u000d\u000a      and changing global media environments has directly influenced the\u000d\u000a      drafting of possible questions for the assistance of Committee members in\u000d\u000a      evidence sessions with high-profile witnesses from organisations such as\u000d\u000a      the British Council, the Ministry of Defence, and UK Trade and Industry',\u000d\u000a      and has further testified to the influence of O'Loughlin's research on\u000d\u000a      measuring the `impact' of narratives, saying that O'Loughlin `successfully\u000d\u000a      assisted the Committee with understanding how some of the more nebulous\u000d\u000a      concepts that are used in the relevant literature &#8212; and by witnesses &#8212;\u000d\u000a      might best be pinned down, such as by recognising the distinction drawn\u000d\u000a      between outputs (for instance, the number of website \"hits\" that the\u000d\u000a      British Museum receives) and outcomes (for instance, the change in\u000d\u000a      attitudes about the UK that witnesses might have seen as a result of their\u000d\u000a      actions)'.

This research showed how discrepancies between the views of\u000d\u000a        policy and media elites on the one side and those of publics on the\u000d\u000a        other side about a range of security threats led to public\u000d\u000a        dissatisfaction with the substance, procedural process and pace of `war\u000d\u000a        on terror' policies and to a government legitimacy deficit. Through\u000d\u000a        grant-funded projects for the ESRC (2007-10), Centre for the Protection\u000d\u000a        of National Infrastructure (2008-09) and Technology Strategy Board\u000d\u000a        (2009-10), O'Loughlin generated analysis of the role of broadcast and\u000d\u000a        post-broadcast media in radicalisation processes. Research demonstrated\u000d\u000a        how journalists, policymakers and citizens were uncertain about the\u000d\u000a        nature of radicalisation, yet also dependent on mainstream news\u000d\u000a        reporting that uncritically reflected those uncertainties. This\u000d\u000a        amplified anxiety and reduced trust in news. Research also demonstrated\u000d\u000a        how new networked gate-keeping functions in the digital media ecology\u000d\u000a        enabled jihadist groups to reach differentiated audiences (v).\u000d\u000a       Semantic polling. O'Loughlin created the concept `semantic\u000d\u000a        polling' to refer to Big Data mining and analysis used to generate\u000d\u000a        `intelligence' about the meaning of texts available in\u000d\u000a        publicly-available social media (vi). In 2009-10 he collaborated with\u000d\u000a        the Cambridge data firm Linguamatics Ltd to develop (patented)\u000d\u000a        methodologies for monitoring Twitter for security risks in a TSB-funded\u000d\u000a        project. This allowed him to develop concepts and methods for monitoring\u000d\u000a        public opinion more generally. This work has extremely broad application\u000d\u000a        beyond war and terrorism because responses to pandemics, financial\u000d\u000a        crises and natural disasters have all been diffused through new media\u000d\u000a        ecologies, triggering new information dynamics through which publics\u000d\u000a        have come to understand events. O'Loughlin's analysis revealed the\u000d\u000a        repertoires of communication used by citizens in new media spaces and\u000d\u000a        the ways elites seek to manage their reputations, information flows and\u000d\u000a        the `movement' of public conversation. O'Loughlin conducted semantic\u000d\u000a        polling during the 2010 UK General Election and for the BBC during the\u000d\u000a        2012 London Olympics, co-leading a project, `Tweeting the Olympics', to\u000d\u000a        explore how multilingual overseas audiences responded to London, the\u000d\u000a        Olympics and the BBC's representation of each.\u000d\u000a       Strategic narratives. Strand 1's explanation of the\u000d\u000a        circulation of jihadist narratives and Western government\u000d\u000a        counter-narratives and Strand 2's development of digital methodologies\u000d\u000a        to trace narrative circulations combined to enable O'Loughlin to pursue\u000d\u000a        research into how strategic narratives are formed, projected and\u000d\u000a        interpreted in international relations generally. This new research\u000d\u000a        developed through a series of strategic narrative workshops\u000d\u000a        (International Studies Association catalytic workshop, 2009; American\u000d\u000a        Political Science Association Political Communication section workshop,\u000d\u000a        2010; and European Consortium for Political Research standing group\u000d\u000a        section, 2010) and produced a strategic narratives monograph in 2013\u000d\u000a        (vii). O'Loughlin's BBC `Tweeting the Olympics' and strategic narratives\u000d\u000a        research led to his appointment on 8 July 2013 as Specialist Advisor to\u000d\u000a        the House of Lords Select Committee on Soft Power and the UK's\u000d\u000a        Influence, bringing him into direct dialogue with those tasked with\u000d\u000a        forming and projecting UK narratives and those in government and\u000d\u000a        publicly-funded cultural institutions tasked with measuring their\u000d\u000a        impact.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Each strand of underpinning research has an interdisciplinary remit,\u000d\u000a      involving collaborations with computer scientists, sociologists,\u000d\u000a      psychologists and political scientists. The ISA, APSA and ECPR workshops\u000d\u000a      each included scholars from history, journalism, sociology and diplomacy\u000d\u000a      studies. Such an approach is necessary to address the difficulties of\u000d\u000a      researching political communication today.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30207","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Building on his work as co-founder of the PSA Young People's Politics\u000a      Specialist Group and the\u000a      APSA Working Group on Young People's Politics, Sloam established a\u000a      substantial network of over\u000a      200 academics and user groups working in this area during the REF period.\u000a      Exploiting this network\u000a      helped him generate engagements and impacts for his research. After\u000a      representatives from the\u000a      Intergenerational Foundation, Shout Out UK and Portsmouth City Council\u000a      attended his April 2011\u000a      HEFCE-funded conference, the Intergenerational Foundation appointed Sloam\u000a      as an advisor,\u000a      where he is assisting with the development of a European intergenerational\u000a      fairness index, Shout\u000a      Out UK appointed him to an ambassadorial role, through which he supports\u000a      their work on\u000a      citizenship education and youth engagement in schools, and Portsmouth City\u000a      Council invited him\u000a      to be a keynote speaker at its Local Democracy Week (14-18 October 2013).\u000a      Similarly, after his\u000a      March 2013 workshops on youth participation in British democracy, which\u000a      were attended by\u000a      representatives of StudentVoice, Sloam began work on a collaboration to\u000a      assess the effectiveness\u000a      of the organisation's leadership and outreach programmes, Sloam's research\u000a      achieved impact\u000a      during the period by: 1) influencing UK policy debate and decision-making\u000a      about young people and\u000a      political engagement; and 2) creating space to debate the social role of\u000a      higher education in the UK.\u000a    Evidence Sloam presented to the Youth Citizenship Commission in 2009 had\u000a      a direct influence on\u000a      key policy makers and the government. The Commission, which met from 2008\u000a      to 2009 and\u000a      reported to the government in June 2009 (`Making the connection.\u000a      Building youth citizenship in the\u000a      UK: Final report of the Youth Citizenship Commission', Ministry of\u000a      Justice), was charged with\u000a      examining what citizenship means to young people; exploring how\u000a      citizenship and political\u000a      engagement among young people can be improved; and leading a consultation\u000a      on whether the\u000a      voting age should be lowered. It reported directly to the Secretary of\u000a      State for Justice and to the\u000a      Prime Minister, and issued two final reports in 2009 to which the\u000a      government formally responded.\u000a      According to the Chair of the Commission `there is clear evidence that\u000a      government accepted the\u000a      overwhelming majority of the Commission's recommendations'.\u000a    Members of the Commission have confirmed that Sloam made very important\u000a      contributions to its\u000a      deliberations. The Chair affirmed that Sloam provided `perhaps the most\u000a      important [contributions]\u000a      offered by any academic, beyond those who sat on the Commission' and that\u000a      given how `the\u000a      Commission's recommendations were overwhelming accepted and implemented,\u000a      Dr. Sloam's work\u000a      [was] of direct policy relevance.' According to another member of the\u000a      Commission, Sloam's\u000a      Parliamentary Affairs article (viii) had considerable influence in\u000a      informing them on the nature of the\u000a      problems to be addressed and their possible solutions, and was widely read\u000a      by Commission\u000a      members. It is cited in the Commission's published literature review. The\u000a      Commission members\u000a      held that Sloam made a `convincing case' in asserting that the issue of\u000a      youth political\u000a      disengagement emanates from alienation and lack of political structures,\u000a      contrary to the commonly\u000a      held view that it was the result of political apathy. The most crucial and\u000a      influential pieces of\u000a      evidence were in respect of Sloam's portrayal of how young people were\u000a      excluded from policy\u000a      deliberation structures within both local government and central\u000a      government departments. In\u000a      addition, Sloam's research highlighted information deficits regarding\u000a      opportunities for young people\u000a      to become engaged in community or institutional activity. It has been\u000a      confirmed that as a result of\u000a      these findings the Youth Citizenship Commission developed specific\u000a      proposals such as youth\u000a      representation on local council departmental decision-making bodies to\u000a      help address both the\u000a      democratic and information deficits. Sloam's overriding argument\u000a      concerning the need to empower\u000a      young people through specific structural changes and adopting new\u000a      attitudes towards the inclusion\u000a      of youth within decision-making bodies became the Commission's dominant\u000a      approach to\u000a      addressing youth disengagement. The full list of Commission\u000a      recommendations in the final report\u000a      greatly reflect Sloam's article. Having utilised his academic research,\u000a      the Commission invited\u000a      Sloam to provide a direct submission to its evidence-gathering processes.\u000a      This was duly\u000a      undertaken and Sloam's contribution, based upon the above themes, is\u000a      acknowledged in the final\u000a      report. For these reasons the Commission Chair affirmed that `Dr Sloam can\u000a      justifiably claim\u000a      significant policy impact in this sphere'.\u000a    The second strand of Sloam's underpinning research had an impact on\u000a      policy debate about the\u000a      social role of higher education. On 5-6 November 2008 he presented on the\u000a      subject of citizenship\u000a      education at a Westminster conference, `Revitalising Politics', organised\u000a      by Colin Hay and Gerry\u000a      Stoker and attended by policymakers and Members of Parliament (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/lbn58ww),\u000a      and\u000a      he later participated in an 8-9 December 2010 Regional Seminar on `Youth\u000a      Participation and\u000a      Democracy' organised by the Inter Parliamentary Union at Portcullis House,\u000a      Westminster\u000a      (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/mvjffq4),\u000a      contributing an article to the IPU Review issue on the event where\u000a      he\u000a      discussed both citizenship education and broader strategies to engage\u000a      young people in politics. In\u000a      2010 Sloam won funding from HEFCE to convene a conference, `A Pedagogy of\u000a      Civic\u000a      Engagement for Higher Education', at Royal Holloway on 15 April 2011.\u000a      Speakers included Prof.\u000a      Benjamin R. Barber and representatives of Demos\/Civworld. The event\u000a      brought together experts\u000a      and stakeholders, including the chief executives of Universities UK and\u000a      the Higher Education\u000a      Academy and the Research Director of HEFCE, to improve evidence-based\u000a      practice in civic\u000a      education in UK higher education. It was a deliberative exercise that\u000a      provided the basis for a report\u000a      produced for HEFCE that was presented to the Department of Business,\u000a      Innovation and Skills. The\u000a      Times Higher Education Supplement wrote an article about the\u000a      conference, linking its themes and\u000a      discussions to issues around funding cuts and the government's `Big\u000a      Society' aspirations.\u000a    Sloam was appointed as a Discipline Associate for Sociology, Anthropology\u000a      and Politics at the\u000a      Higher Education Academy in 2010\/11, bringing his Deweyan approach to bear\u000a      on promoting the\u000a      role of evidence-based `experiential learning' in political science\u000a      education. He was also invited by\u000a      the German Federal Agency for Political Education to help develop a\u000a      `Networking European\u000a      Citizenship Initiative', participating in development events for NECE in\u000a      June and October 2013 and\u000a      attending a meeting in the Hague on 14-16 November 2013.\u000a    Sloam's continued involvement in the strategy and activities of Shout Out\u000a      UK, the Intergenerational\u000a      Foundation, Portsmouth City Council, StudentVoice and the German Federal\u000a      Agency for Political\u000a      Education demonstrate the sustainability of the relationships and impact\u000a      activities he has built\u000a      within this REF period. The Intergenerational Foundation's Co-founder\u000a      testifies to Sloam's\u000a      importance to their work, writing that, `Dr Sloam's expertise on the\u000a      political engagement of young\u000a      people has been crucial to the Intergenerational Foundation's work\u000a      promoting the rights of younger\u000a      and future generations in policy-making. He serves on IF's Advisory Board\u000a      and acts as an expert\u000a      sounding board to ensure that research relevant to his area of expertise\u000a      is conducted robustly'. His\u000a      comments also highlight the importance of Sloam's ability to contextualise\u000a      British politics within\u000a      European political trends: `Dr Sloam's knowledge of youth voting patterns\u000a      and youth engagement\u000a      with politics has been crucial to IF's latest work which involves\u000a      assessing the feasibility of\u000a      extending the UK Intergenerational Fairness Index to cover all 27 European\u000a      countries. This\u000a      groundbreaking work attempts to compare intergenerational fairness across\u000a      borders and will, we\u000a      hope, provide both country specific and pan-European evidence of the\u000a      intergenerational imbalance\u000a      of policies'. Sloam is currently moving forward with research to assess\u000a      StudentVoice's leadership\u000a      and outreach programmes, with a recent funding bid to the British Academy\u000a      (decision pending).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Recent decades have witnessed a rapid decline in youth participation in\u000a      UK electoral politics, in\u000a      terms of both voting and party membership.

Sloam's research and\u000a      his collaboration with user\u000a      groups have addressed this important issue and strengthened efforts to\u000a      engage young people in\u000a      politics, broadly conceived.

Young people's participation in politics. After working at the\u000a      University of Birmingham as\u000a      a research fellow and co-applicant on the EU FP5 project, `EUYOUPART:\u000a      Political\u000a      Participation of Young People in Europe &#8212; Development of Indicators for\u000a      Comparative\u000a      Research in the European Union`, 2003-05, Sloam joined the Unit in 2005\u000a      and produced\u000a      analysis confirming that today's young people have very personalised\u000a      conceptions of\u000a      citizenship and politics, in accordance with their more diverse values and\u000a      lifestyles as\u000a      compared with older cohorts (viii). This study and later analysis of\u000a      survey data confirmed that\u000a      existing research of civic engagement and political participation could\u000a      not explain today's\u000a      democratic politics because it relied on narrow conceptions of `politics'\u000a      and failed to explore\u000a      properly both the diversity of forms of participation within the current\u000a      generation of young\u000a      people and the large differences in participation that exist &#8212; especially\u000a      in new forms of\u000a      engagement &#8212; due to socio-economic status and civic culture (i, iii). In\u000a      this context, youth\u000a      participation in politics is disturbingly low in the UK compared to other\u000a      West European states\u000a      (ii). These findings informed Sloam's impactful research as he pursued a\u000a      research agenda\u000a      that has been youth-focussed, multi-disciplinary and comparative, with\u000a      outputs that include\u000a      his recent edited volume of the Hansard Society journal, Parliamentary\u000a        Affairs (iv), and\u000a      articles in prominent international journals such as Comparative\u000a        Political Studies (iii) and\u000a      West European Politics (i).\u000a    \u000a    2. Teaching and Learning, Citizenship Education, the Social Role of\u000a        Higher Education.\u000a      Sloam's work adopts a constructivist approach to teaching and learning\u000a      that dovetails with a\u000a      Deweyan belief that all effective education is fundamentally based on the\u000a      individual's\u000a      experiences in and of democracy (v, vii). His research on citizenship\u000a      education in schools\u000a      demonstrates how these insights are realised in practice. Key indicators\u000a      of the effectiveness\u000a      of citizenship education are the school's `democratic\/participatory ethos'\u000a      and the extent to\u000a      which teaching practice draws on pupils' experience outside the school\u000a      environment. In this\u000a      context, Sloam contributed research on citizenship education to the\u000a      `revitalizing politics'\u000a      debate led by Colin Hay, Gerry Stoker and the Hansard Society (vi). In the\u000a      UK, the Crick\u000a      Report led to the introduction of citizenship education in English\u000a      secondary schools in 2002.\u000a      However, unlike the United States, there has been very little academic\u000a      study or policy\u000a      reflection on civic and political education in higher education in the UK.\u000a      In 2011, working with\u000a      HEFCE, Sloam convened a major conference, `A Pedagogy of Civic Engagement\u000a      for Higher\u000a      Education'. Its focus explicitly built on his own research and it acted as\u000a      a forum both to\u000a      discuss ideas and to influence the practice of teachers\/lecturers and\u000a      administrators within the\u000a      sector. Sloam also undertook original research in the US with colleagues\u000a      at the Carnegie\u000a      Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching to investigate how best\u000a      practice can be\u000a      transferred to the UK (for example through `service learning'). This\u000a      research directly informed\u000a      Sloam's collaboration with HEFCE and fed into his work as a Discipline\u000a      Associate of the\u000a      Higher Education Academy in 2010\/11.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31484","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The two areas of impact referred to in (1) correspond almost exactly to\u000a      the two fields of underpinning research described in (2). Thus the work on\u000a      ecologism informs the impact on campaigns for social, economic and\u000a      political change, while the research on ecological citizenship underpins\u000a      the development of citizenship-based policies for encouraging\u000a      pro-environmental behaviour. Inevitably there is overlap between these two\u000a      strands of research and the corresponding impact.\u000a    (1) Impact based on research on ecologism has been achieved through\u000a      engagement with national political organisations. This takes two principal\u000a      forms: (a) Dobson's role as a lead writer on the 2010 Green Party\u000a      Manifesto, and (b) his role as a founder-member of the Green House think\u000a      tank.\u000a    (a) In relation to the 2010 Green Party Manifesto, the Green Party\u000a      parliamentary office attests that: `The manifesto is a statement of the\u000a      Party's discourse and its political project as well as its policy\u000a      proposals and Andrew Dobson was asked to write it because the Green Party\u000a      was confident in his ability to frame this project based on knowledge of\u000a      his previous published research and its deep influence on their activists'\u000a      [source 1]. Dobson's role was to set the order and tone and to write the\u000a      main text. It draws on Dobson's research on the relationship between\u000a      citizenship and sustainability: `As citizens we think of the good of\u000a      everyone and of the future, and not just what we think is good for\u000a      ourselves, now. Creating a fair and sustainable society is a job for\u000a      government at all levels &#8212; but it is also a job for us as citizens' (Green\u000a      Party 2010, pp. 28-9), and, `We would initiate a revolution in trust...The\u000a      Green Party will trust citizens and workers, not over-regulate them'\u000a      (p.29). Dobson discussed the text in various face-to-face and online\u000a      forums and it went through a number of iterations until the final version\u000a      was ready for use in the 2010 General Election campaign. The manifesto\u000a      launch was reported across the national print and broadcast media,\u000a      including by the BBC and Channel 4 News (April 15th 2010). It\u000a      was central to the Green Party's campaign for the General Election 2010,\u000a      the Local Elections in 2011, and the European Parliament Elections in\u000a      2013. 264,243 people voted for the Green Party in the General election\u000a      2010, with the party gaining its first parliamentary seat (Brighton\u000a      Pavilion) in the election, 130 Green Party seats on 43 Principal\u000a      Authorities were won in the 2011 Local Election, and two Green European\u000a      Members of Parliament were elected in May 2013. A Green Party Policy\u000a      Co-ordinator has confirmed the continuing significance of the manifesto,\u000a      stating that it is still very much a live document, available on the Party\u000a      website, that he refers to on a daily basis, and that he directs those\u000a      with policy enquiries to it.\u000a    (b) Discussions after the 2010 General Election led to the creation of\u000a      the Green House think tank of which Dobson is a founder member. The\u000a      significance of Green House to the policy environment is indicated by the\u000a      reporting of its launch by the Government Department for Environment,\u000a      Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), where Green Party Leader Caroline Lucas\u000a      was quoted as saying that Green House was an important step in bringing\u000a      Green politics into the mainstream (see DEFRA 2011). Dobson wrote Green\u000a      House's first report, `Sustainability Citizenship' (2011) (downloaded\u000a      1,112 times by 10 October 2013), and he was a key organiser and speaker at\u000a      a major Green House conference on the `Future of Green Politics' on 13\u000a      October 2012, attended by over 100 people.\u000a    2) The impact of Professor Dobson's research on environmental citizenship\u000a      is evident through the attention given to his ideas by a number of public\u000a      organizations. Dobson's work on environmental citizenship suggests a\u000a      strategy based on people's capacity for co-operative, other-regarding\u000a      behaviour. This is an alternative to current Government policy for\u000a      encouraging pro-environment behaviour, which is dominated by fiscal\u000a      incentives\/disincentives such as congestion charges and fines for rubbish.\u000a      This policy is preferred by Government because evidence suggests that it\u000a      works, in the short-term at least, and because it flows from the standard\u000a      economic behavioural view that people are motivated by self-interest.\u000a      However, there is increasing empirical evidence, some of which is based on\u000a      Professor Dobson's work, which suggests that people do indeed have the\u000a      capacity to act as `environmental citizens', and that this should be\u000a      reflected in policy design.\u000a    (a) In the light of this, Professor Dobson was asked by the Sustainable\u000a      Development Research Network (SDRN, which is funded by DEFRA, and of which\u000a      Professor Dobson was a member from its founding until 2012) to conduct a\u000a      systematic review of the environmental citizenship evidence. The review\u000a      was published in November 2010. It argued that environmental citizenship\u000a      should be regarded by government as a legitimate and effective policy tool\u000a      for pro-sustainability behaviour change, along with more established\u000a      approaches based on financial incentives and behavioural economics\u000a      (`nudge'). The report and briefing was distributed via the SDRN mailing,\u000a      reaching over 2,500 members of the network representing those with a\u000a      policy or research interest in sustainable development. It also went out\u000a      via SD Scene, which goes to about 25,000 policymakers across\u000a      government. The launch event in November 2010 was attended by members of\u000a      the policy community, and the report was the subject of the closing\u000a      plenary of the SDRN's annual conference in December 2010, with DEFRA's\u000a      chief social scientist giving a keynote response. The annual conference\u000a      attracted 150 policy makers from across government and the voluntary\/third\u000a      sector.\u000a    One Natural England social science specialist gives an indication of the\u000a      report's impact by saying: `Your review and conceptualisation on\u000a      \"environmental citizenship\" have informed our understanding and thinking\u000a      in relation to behavioural social science and the economics of\u000a      incentives...particularly useful - for instance in relation to thinking\u000a      around how a landscape-scale or group based agri-environment option might\u000a      best be designed. The work also helpfully informs how NE can best engage\u000a      in partnership working with stakeholders and communities'.\u000a    (b) Following the publication of Dobson's review by the SDRN, he was\u000a      asked by the Development Education Association charity Think Global to\u000a      join a House of Lords roundtable discussion on `Nudge' and changing\u000a      environmental behaviour. A Think Global executive comments that Dobson's\u000a      document `was on the Think Global and Involve websites and widely\u000a      circulated to policy thinkers and influencers. There is obviously a big\u000a      discussion about behaviour change, and ... the note was part of this\u000a      debate'. Dobson's SDRN review, and his presentation at the roundtable\u000a      event, led to other invitations and references to his work. For instance,\u000a      Ofgem invited Dobson to give a presentation to their senior management,\u000a      one member of which commented, `I felt that your presentation on\u000a      environmental citizenship was very relevant to some of the issues we are\u000a      thinking about in Ofgem'. Dobson's work was quoted in a Fabian Society\u000a      report `Climate Change and Sustainable Consumption: What Do the Public\u000a      Think Is Fair', and he was listed as one of several experts they\u000a      consulted. Dobson's review is also cited in the final report of the\u000a      `Fishing for the Markets' evaluation to DEFRA in April 2011: `Evidence\u000a      shows that fiscal incentives may not be as important as we think they are\u000a      and that people will choose to purchase a product that is environmentally\u000a      sustainable as they perceive there is some common good in doing so'\u000a      (Evaluation Strategies Matrix, 2011, p. 11).\u000a    Dobson's research on environmental citizenship challenges the currently\u000a      dominant assumptions that govern most public policy in this area, and the\u000a      repeated invitations and citations referred to above are indicative of the\u000a      impact this work has had.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Andrew Dobson's research into environmental politics and, in\u000a      particular, the nature, meaning, and policy relevance of the idea of\u000a      `environmental citizenship', spans 25 years.

The rise of environmental politics up the political agenda\u000a      has ensured that `environmentalism' is now a part of everyday political\u000a      life, but Dobson's `ecologism' is a challenge to the conventional\u000a      consensus that sustainability can be seamlessly woven into any political\u000a      party's manifesto. He argues that it is as much a self-contained ideology\u000a      as socialism, liberalism or conservatism. Dobson has been engaged in\u000a      research establishing `ecologism' as an ideology in its own right for over\u000a      20 years, and recent interventions have focused on the role of ecologism\u000a      in the `we are all environmentalists now' conditions of the new millennium\u000a      (2009).\u000a    (2) The second strand of research - ecological citizenship (2003) - has\u000a      developed out of Dobson's long-standing interest in the effect that the\u000a      `ecological turn' has had on enduring themes in political theory. His work\u000a      in this field includes books and articles on democracy and on justice, and\u000a      `citizenship' is the third concept towards which he has turned his\u000a      attention. The result was\/is an original notion of citizenship, different\u000a      from those that dominate the conceptual landscape, such as liberal,\u000a      republican and cosmopolitan citizenship. Ecological citizenship is a\u000a      particular inflection of what Dobson calls `post-cosmopolitan'\u000a      citizenship. Its defining characteristics are 1: non-territoriality &#8212; i.e.\u000a      the obligations of the ecological citizen transcend national boundaries,\u000a      2: taking responsibility for the size of one's ecological footprint is a\u000a      key duty for the environmental citizen, 3: the obligations of ecological\u000a      citizenship are not owed reciprocally, 4: the principal virtue of\u000a      ecological citizenship is justice and 5: the obligation of the ecological\u000a      citizen is to reduce the size of one's ecological footprint where\u000a      appropriate, in the name of a just distribution of ecological space.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31732","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The origins of the impact go back to 2003 when Ireland's police and\u000d\u000a      security service, An Garda\u000d\u000a      S&#237;och&#225;na, its Defence Forces and Government Departments including An\u000d\u000a      Taoiseach (Prime\u000d\u000a      Minister), Foreign Affairs, Defence and Justice each agreed to formally\u000d\u000a      participate in the first\u000d\u000a      academic evaluation of Irish national security policy since the foundation\u000d\u000a      of the state.

It identified institutionalised\u000d\u000a      political and financial\u000d\u000a      pressures, relating to internal revenues, procurement and promotions,\u000d\u000a      which placed at serious risk\u000d\u000a      the capacities of Ireland's national security agencies &#8212; the Garda\u000d\u000a      S&#237;och&#225;na and Defence Forces &#8212; to\u000d\u000a      contain and manage threat against Ireland. It was based upon\u000d\u000a      semi-structured interviews with\u000d\u000a      more than 20 Irish security leaders including the Secretaries General of\u000d\u000a      the Departments of the\u000d\u000a      Taoiseach (Prime Minister), Foreign Affairs, Justice and Defence, as well\u000d\u000a      as assistant secretaries\u000d\u000a      and other senior government officials; the Chief of Staff of the Irish\u000d\u000a      Defence Forces and the\u000d\u000a      directors and deputy directors of military intelligence, military\u000d\u000a      operations, strategic planning and\u000d\u000a      training and the Garda Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner for Crime and\u000d\u000a      Security and various\u000d\u000a      heads of Garda service. Evidence was analysed combining three approaches:\u000d\u000a      historical\u000d\u000a      institutionalism, bureaucratic politics and threat evaluation. The absence\u000d\u000a      of naval and airborne\u000d\u000a      systems to defend Ireland, an island state on the European Union's\u000d\u000a      Atlantic western periphery,\u000d\u000a      was found to be directly attributable to deeply institutionalised\u000d\u000a      financial and political pressures on\u000d\u000a      the Irish agencies. Perhaps the most serious finding was of a\u000d\u000a      malfunctioning process of national\u000d\u000a      threat assessment, which a senior Irish Army officer argued meant that in\u000d\u000a      Irish security decision\u000d\u000a      making: `we only identify as much threat as we can afford' (Mulqueen\u000d\u000a      2009a). Mulqueen's research\u000d\u000a      uncovers evidence that despite a request by Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime\u000d\u000a      Minister) for an all\u000d\u000a      spectrum threat assessment by the Irish agencies in the days after the\u000d\u000a      9\/11 attack, Ireland's navy\u000d\u000a      and air corps were effectively, if unwittingly, excluded from this\u000d\u000a      process. This led to a skewed\u000d\u000a      official threat assessment that ignored sea and airborne threats. This\u000d\u000a      threat assessment remains\u000d\u000a      intact today. His other work that year (2009b) updates this analysis to\u000d\u000a      capture a significant\u000d\u000a      development in Irish military intelligence.\u000d\u000a    Mulqueen's (2012) publication marks a continuation of this previous work\u000d\u000a      and involves a case\u000d\u000a      study of the Irish Navy and its associated structure, the Irish Maritime\u000d\u000a      Energy Research Cluster\u000d\u000a      (IMERC, www.imerc.ie). This research was produced in the Centre for\u000d\u000a      Applied Research in\u000d\u000a      Security Innovation (CASI), established at Hope, by Mulqueen, in January\u000d\u000a      2012 and funded by the\u000d\u000a      UK Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) grant. It highlighted a\u000d\u000a      remarkable widening in its\u000d\u000a      military role, with potential applicability to many navies and clear\u000d\u000a      implications for how they might\u000d\u000a      contribute to the states and citizenry they serve. The (2012) work calls\u000d\u000a      for a research agenda\u000d\u000a      focussed upon the emerging use by national security agencies of an\u000d\u000a      approach, systematic\u000d\u000a      innovation, to more effectively engage with unfamiliar partners, notably\u000d\u000a      high-tech industry partners,\u000d\u000a      to derive networked solutions against non-traditional threats. It also\u000d\u000a      identified advanced education\u000d\u000a      among naval personnel and naval ships as key assets to promote innovative\u000d\u000a      partnerships with\u000d\u000a      industry that would generate sustainable wealth from a maritime economy\u000d\u000a      rooted in environmental\u000d\u000a      good practice. It evaluated the likely significance to other navies of the\u000d\u000a      Irish navy's adoption of a\u000d\u000a      strategic goal &#8212; to be the smartest, most innovative small navy in the\u000d\u000a      world by 2016 &#8212; and its\u000d\u000a      establishment with academic and industry partners of the Irish Maritime\u000d\u000a      Energy Resource Cluster\u000d\u000a      (IMERC) (www.imerc.ie). This will\u000d\u000a      enable the navy to partner with industries to access dual-use\u000d\u000a      technologies that might not otherwise have been developed or developed a\u000d\u000a      prohibitively high cost\u000d\u000a      for a small navy. At the time of writing, the Irish government had,\u000d\u000a      through a green paper on\u000d\u000a      defence, proposed the incorporation of this employment-facing approach\u000d\u000a      into Irish Defence Policy\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/www.defence.ie\/WebSite.nsf\/grnPaperE\u000d\u000a      &#8212; see pp. 28, 29), and in Irish Marine Policy\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/www.ouroceanwealth.ie\/Pages\/IMP.aspx).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31733","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research of Rees and Holmes has over the years involved looking at\u000a      the impact of the EU\u000a      (Europeanisation) on Ireland, as well as Ireland's role in Europe. In the\u000a      context of Ireland, which is\u000a      a small EU member state, there is considerable opportunity for academics\u000a      to work closely with\u000a      government officials, elected representatives and government ministers. In\u000a      effect, Ireland is tightly\u000a      networked and much of the research being undertaken is available to and\u000a      informs policy debates\u000a      and public discussion. This is evident through the work of the Institute\u000a      for International and\u000a      European Affairs (IIEA)&#8212;Ireland's leading think-tank in this area--and the\u000a      Royal Irish Academy\u000a      (RIA). Rees has played a role in both bodies, previously being part of\u000a      IIEA governing body and a\u000a      committee member of RIA International Affairs Committee. In both these\u000a      bodies, there is close\u000a      interplay and involvement of officials and academics. The research\u000a      undertaken in this study can be\u000a      traced back to 1997, when Rees and Holmes first analysed the use of EU\u000a      referenda in Ireland\u000a      (Coakley, Holmes and Rees 1997).\u000a    Rees and Holmes have sought in their earlier research to ensure that it\u000a      informs and impacts on an\u000a      understanding of the impact of Europeanisation on Irish public policy\u000a      (especially regional and\u000a      environmental policy), political institutions and socialisation agents\u000a      (parties, interest groups). Prior\u000a      to this, Rees's research on Europeanisation and Ireland (2006, 2010) and\u000a      that of Holmes (2005,\u000a      2008) have aimed to have such an impact on the debates over Ireland's role\u000a      in the European\u000a      Union, and the impact of the EU on Ireland. This has previously led to EU\u000a      funded research being\u000a      disseminated via workshops in Brussels attended by EU Commission officials\u000a      (2003, 2004);\u000a      dissemination of results via publication of specific country reports and\u000a      an integrated comparative\u000a      report (2004-05, 2006, 2008), and a public workshop for local \/ regional\u000a      authorities and other state\u000a      and private actors in the Mid-West Region in Ireland (2004). All of this\u000a      has contributed to a better\u000a      public understanding of the impact of the EU on Irish public policy.\u000a    This trend was continued in the current impact case study which focuses\u000a      principally on the\u000a      research undertaken by Rees and Holmes around the Lisbon Treaty\u000a      referendum. This referendum\u000a      was held in Ireland (June 2008) to enable Ireland to ratify the EU Treaty\u000a      of Lisbon (signed 13\u000a      December 2007). Ireland was the only one of the 27 EU member states to\u000a      hold a referendum to\u000a      ratify the Treaty. On this occasion (7th EU referendum), the\u000a      people voted \"No\" to the Treaty,\u000a      leading eventually to a second referendum in October 2009, in which the\u000a      \"Yes\" vote won the day.\u000a      In each of the cases, an amendment to the Irish Constitution (Bunreacht Na\u000a      h&#201;ireann, Article 29.4)\u000a      was required, which necessitated the holding of a referendum, which has\u000a      led to a number of legal\u000a      challenges which have required consideration by the Supreme Court (see Crotty\u000a        v. An Taoiseach\u000a      in 1987). This most recently happened in 2013 over the ninth referendum\u000a      held on the EU Fiscal\u000a      Stability Treaty on 31 May 2013 (Rees, forthcoming 2013, Jahruch der\u000a        Europ&#228;ischen Integration).\u000a    As a consequence of these challenges and the problems associated with the\u000a      conduct of previous\u000a      referenda, there has been considerable concern to ensure that public\u000a      debate over the issues are\u000a      informed by expert and academic commentary, as much as by political debate\u000a      between differing\u000a      sides in the referenda. As a result of the research undertaken jointly\u000a      with Holmes as well as\u000a      independently, Rees was invited as an expert commentator to participate in\u000a      the public deliberations\u000a      of the Joint Committee on European Affairs at its public meeting in\u000a      Limerick. The meeting aimed to\u000a      provide information, as well as answers, around the implications of the\u000a      Treaty of Lisbon for Ireland.\u000a      In these contexts, much of the discussion has tended to focus on the\u000a      benefits and costs of EU\u000a      membership to Ireland. The research by Rees on Europeanisation in Ireland\u000a      aims to provide an\u000a      explanation of and inform debate about the benefits and costs of EU\u000a      membership, especially in the\u000a      context of new treaty provisions in the Lisbon Treaty. In particular,\u000a      Rees's research on Irish\u000a      security policy aimed to provide further analysis of the implications of\u000a      the EU treaty revision for\u000a      Irish \"neutrality\" and Ireland's security commitments to the EU arising\u000a      from such treaty change.\u000a      Rees also went on to speak at and provide information briefings at party\u000a      run information sessions\u000a      during the referendum.\u000a    Following the initial failure of the Treaty of Lisbon at the June\u000a      referendum, there was considerable\u000a      debate and discussion in Ireland regarding what would happen next. In the\u000a      context of this\u000a      discussion, the Joint Committee on the Constitution decided in September\u000a      2008 to undertake a\u000a      review of the constitutional framework governing the constitutional\u000a      referendum process. Arising\u000a      out of Rees's on-going research&#8212;now based at Hope and in continuing\u000a      interrogation of the shifting\u000a      scene--he was invited to address an Oireachtas (Irish parliament)\u000a      Committee on the Constitution\u000a      on the referendum process. The broader aim of the committee was to foster\u000a      public debate on and\u000a      awareness of Irish membership of the European Union following the `No'\u000a      result in the first\u000a      referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon on 12 June 2008.\u000a    The testimony by Rees was the focus of debate and discussion by the\u000a      parliamentary members of the\u000a      committee and the work of the committee (including testimony by witnesses)\u000a      was reported on in the\u000a      media. A report on the testimony was included in the official\u000a      parliamentary records of the Oireachtas\u000a      Joint Committee on the Constitution and published as a separate report by\u000a      the Oireachtas\u000a      (http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/documents\/committees30thdail\/jconstitution\/report_2008\/Report20090402.pdf.\u000a      It subsequently formed part of the citizens' advice information provided\u000a      by the Referendum\u000a      Commission (the body charged with providing neutral and unbiased\u000a      information on all referendums\u000a      on the constitution of the Republic of Ireland).\u000a    A number of communities and groups availed of the research including\u000a      Irish politicians, especially\u000a      those most active in EU affairs, such as the Taoiseach Enda Kenny (Fine\u000a      Gael), as well as Irish\u000a      lobby groups, such as those active in EU affairs. The research and the\u000a      direct impact associated\u000a      with it might also have contributed to shaping public attitudes on the EU,\u000a      since it put forward a\u000a      generally positive picture of Irish involvement with the EU and since the\u000a      outcome of the second\u000a      Treaty of Lisbon referendum on 2 October 2009 was a `Yes' vote. However,\u000a      this cannot be proven,\u000a      given the variety of those involved in contributing to the information\u000a      campaign. It should, however,\u000a      be noted that research published on the outcome of the second Lisbon\u000a      Treaty referendum\u000a      highlights the importance of ensuring that high quality information is\u000a      available to the electorate and\u000a      that it is provided in a timely manner. The provision of such information\u000a      on such complicated\u000a      matters as treaty reform is critical to ensuring that the public engage\u000a      and vote in referendums.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research contributed to the public information campaign which was\u000a      conducted as part of the\u000a      referendum campaigns on the Treaty of Lisbon in Ireland, as well as more\u000a      generally impacting on\u000a      how referendums are run; this includes up to the Fiscal Stability Treaty\u000a      referendum on 30 May\u000a      2013.

Holmes was entered in the RAE 2008 and has been at\u000a      Hope throughout\u000a      the census period whilst Rees joined as Professor of International\u000a      Politics in 2008.\u000a      Rees and Holmes have examined how opposition to European Integration has\u000a      emerged around\u000a      specific referenda in Ireland. Holmes (2005) conducted an analysis of\u000a      campaign documents, press\u000a      statements, and other material produced by parties and groups that have\u000a      campaigned for No votes\u000a      in Ireland's EU referendums. The objective was to identify and categorise\u000a      the various different\u000a      groups that have campaigned for No votes in Ireland's European\u000a      referendums, to categorise the\u000a      different issues that they have concentrated on, to map the linkages\u000a      between groups and issues,\u000a      and to identify the strategies enabling a rather disparate set of actors\u000a      to work together. This\u000a      resulted in the publication of a chapter in an edited volume (Holmes\u000a      2005). A more recent study by\u000a      Holmes (2008) looked at the referendum over the Lisbon Treaty whilst in\u000a      2012, Holmes has also\u000a      analysed the responses of the Irish Labour Party to European integration.\u000a      Holmes's work\u000a      contributes to the context for this impact case study in two ways: his\u000a      analyses of the impact of\u000a      European integration on the Irish Labour Party add to an understanding of\u000a      the general impact of\u000a      integration on Irish society and politics and his work on the persistence\u000a      and development of\u000a      opposition to integration in Ireland forms part of the backdrop for\u000a      considering the problems faced in\u000a      ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Fiscal Stability Treaty.\u000a    Rees has published an annual review (2005 to date) on Ireland and the EU,\u000a      including looking at\u000a      referendums, in the German Yearbook of European Integration\u000a      (Institute for European\u000a      Politics\/Nomos) and he has also undertaken an annual evaluation of Irish\u000a      foreign policy 1994-2011, which includes an examination of Ireland's role in the EU. This\u000a      annual review is published in\u000a      Irish Studies in International Affairs (1994-2011: Royal Irish\u000a      Academy). This draws on interviews\u000a      with officials and other sources including from the Departments of Foreign\u000a      Affairs, Defence and the\u000a      Taoiseach, as well as the Oireachtas. The journal is circulated by the\u000a      Department of Foreign\u000a      Affairs to its embassies overseas and is annually launched by the Minister\u000a      for Foreign Affairs.\u000a      Rees argues in his research that the EU has had a significant impact on\u000a      how Irish public policy in\u000a      Ireland adapted to Europe and how policy learning occurred. However, he\u000a      questions the degree to\u000a      which this is embedded in the Irish public policy process.\u000a    The various referenda on EU treaty changes provide key points at which\u000a      the impact of\u000a      Europeanisation in Ireland is publically debated and voted on. Rees, Quinn\u000a      and Connaughton\u000a      carried out research interviews with personnel in Irish government\u000a      departments, agencies and in\u000a      regional\/local authorities as part of a project looking at Europeanisation\u000a      in Ireland between 2006\u000a      and 2009, which resulted in the publication of a book on Europeanisation\u000a        and new patterns of\u000a      governance in Ireland and a chapter within this volume\u000a      (Connaughton, Quinn, Rees 2010). This\u000a      built on an earlier EU 5th Framework project which examined\u000a      state adaptation and policy learning in\u000a      regional and environmental policy in Cohesion &amp; CEEC states. This was\u000a      disseminated via public\u000a      seminars, including in Brussels (European Commission), Dublin and the\u000a      Mid-West in Ireland to EU,\u000a      national and local officials, as well as through reports to DG Research\u000a      (EU Commission) and the\u000a      creation of a web site for dissemination. It was published as an EU report\u000a      and as EU Enlargement\u000a        and Multi-Level Governance in Public Policy-Making (2006) (Rees\u000a      co-editor).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31879","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research has generated significant and wide reaching impact.\u000d\u000a      Dissemination of research outputs and engagement with the media has informed\u000a        the debate by challenging existing views in a number of key areas of\u000d\u000a      reform.

Several aspects of this evidence were referred to\u000d\u000a        in the Committee's report, in particular on the patchy nature of\u000d\u000a        expertise in the House, the fairness of places reserved for particular\u000d\u000a        religious groups, and concerns about the efficacy of the Government's\u000d\u000a        proposals for by-elections to the second chamber (3). The research also\u000d\u000a        informed a submission in 2011 by the researchers to the House of Lords\u000d\u000a        Constitution Committee's inquiry into the process of constitutional\u000d\u000a        reform, which was also referenced in the Committee's report (4).\u000d\u000a      \u000aWider reach &#8212; the research has influenced other groups\u000d\u000a        interested in House of Lords reform, featuring, for example, in the\u000d\u000a        Electoral Reform Society's evidence to the Joint Committee on the Draft\u000d\u000a        House of Lords Reform Bill, to support the Society's call for a\u000d\u000a        deepening of expertise within the second chamber, and in the Campaign\u000d\u000a        for Science and Engineering's policy report on House of Lords Reform\u000d\u000a          and Expertise (5).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Parliament and the intelligence and security services\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aInforming the debate &#8212; the research has been carried out\u000d\u000a        at a time when there has been considerable debate over the scrutiny of\u000d\u000a        intelligence, and has fed into this debate at a number of levels. It has\u000d\u000a        twice been discussed on BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour (in\u000d\u000a        2009 and 2011) in relation to proposed reform of the Intelligence and\u000d\u000a        Security Committee (ISC), including a debate between Defty and a former\u000d\u000a        Chair of the ISC (6). It has been cited in a number of House of Commons\u000d\u000a        briefing papers on the ISC (7).\u000d\u000a      \u000aInfluencing the reform process &#8212; evidence submitted by\u000d\u000a        the researchers to the government's consultation on the Security and\u000d\u000a          Justice Green paper (2011) had a direct influence on subsequent\u000d\u000a        proposals for reform. The submission was cited several times in the\u000d\u000a        government's response, and several of the recommendations and elements\u000d\u000a        of the subsequent Bill reflected those from the submission. The research\u000d\u000a        provided evidence, including data from interviews with over 100\u000d\u000a        parliamentarians, that highlighted considerable support for reform of\u000d\u000a        the ISC, including its reconstitution as a committee of parliament, a\u000d\u000a        position which was subsequently adopted in the Justice and Security\u000d\u000a        Bill. The Government's response also highlighted the submission's\u000d\u000a        recommendation that `the ISC could and should do more to engage with\u000d\u000a        Parliament in order to enhance wider knowledge and understanding of the\u000d\u000a        Agencies and the nature and limitations of intelligence', and, following\u000d\u000a        reform, the ISC has moved towards holding some evidence sessions in\u000d\u000a        public (8). This research also contributed to submissions by Bochel,\u000d\u000a        Defty, Kirkpatrick and others to the House of Lords Constitution\u000d\u000a        Committee's 2011 inquiry into the process of constitutional reform, and\u000d\u000a        on the restrictions on the interception of MPs' communications to the\u000d\u000a        Government's consultation on Parliamentary Privilege in 2012.\u000d\u000a      the interviews conducted for this research themselves also provided\u000d\u000a        significant engagement with key individuals &#8212; senior officials,\u000d\u000a        Ministers and other parliamentarians &#8212; who were directly involved in the\u000d\u000a        formulation of proposals for reform of the Intelligence and Security\u000d\u000a        Committee. A summary of findings was also sent to all participants and\u000d\u000a        other interested parties in 2012. Correspondence shows, for example,\u000d\u000a        that the briefing paper was read by the Secretary of State for Justice\u000d\u000a        and the Minister for Justice, while the Clerk of the Joint Committee on\u000d\u000a        the National Security Strategy circulated it to Committee members. The\u000d\u000a        research also prompted at least one MP to table a number of\u000d\u000a        parliamentary questions regarding the interception of MPs'\u000d\u000a        communications (9).\u000d\u000a      \u000aWider reach &#8212; as with the research on the House of\u000d\u000a        Lords, this research also impacted on other organisations interested in\u000d\u000a        reform. The researchers' earlier work on reform of the ISC featured in\u000d\u000a        the Equality and Human Rights Commission's submission to the Justice and\u000d\u000a        Security Consultation, and was cited in Democratic Audit's 2012 audit of\u000d\u000a        democracy in the UK, which highlighted the research's emphasis on the\u000d\u000a        role of select committees as providing an alternative means of scrutiny\u000d\u000a        beyond the ISC (10).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Through engagement with government, parliamentary committees, individual\u000d\u000a      parliamentarians, and the media, this research has generated impact which\u000d\u000a      is both significant and far reaching.

The research that underpins this case study has\u000d\u000a      sought to broaden understanding and influence debate in relation to the\u000d\u000a      legislative, scrutiny and representative roles of Parliament in a number\u000d\u000a      of policy areas. Modernisation, social policies and welfare reform were\u000d\u000a      key elements of the Labour governments' reform programme from 1997, and of\u000d\u000a      the Coalition government elected in 2010.

This involved interviews with 10% of members of\u000d\u000a        the House of Lords. This research also explored a number of issues\u000d\u000a        related to the role of the House of Lords, particularly in the context\u000d\u000a        of proposals for reform;\u000d\u000a      \u000aParliamentary scrutiny of the Intelligence and Security Services\u000d\u000a        (2009-2012) &#8212; this project, funded by the Leverhulme Trust, built upon\u000d\u000a        earlier research by Defty. Through detailed analysis of parliamentary\u000d\u000a        business, coupled with interviews with a large sample of\u000d\u000a        parliamentarians, the research provided a new and groundbreaking\u000d\u000a        assessment of the extent to which Parliament is effective in\u000d\u000a        scrutinising intelligence and security issues, and its capacity to\u000d\u000a        provide effective oversight of the intelligence and security agencies.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Key findings\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The research on Parliament and welfare policy found, for example, some\u000d\u000a        evidence to support claims for the emergence of a new cross-party\u000d\u000a        consensus on welfare, particularly in the House of Commons.\u000d\u000a      The research on the House of Lords challenged existing arguments about\u000d\u000a        the perceived expertise of the Second Chamber, and provided new evidence\u000d\u000a        of the various ways in which `representation' is understood within and\u000d\u000a        in relation to the House of Lords. It also identified significantly less\u000d\u000a        consensus than in the House of Commons, which may have significant\u000d\u000a        implications for the passage of social policy legislation.\u000d\u000a      While existing research on Parliament and the intelligence services\u000d\u000a        had focused almost exclusively on the work of the Intelligence and\u000d\u000a        Security Committee, this project considered other actual and potential\u000d\u000a        forms of parliamentary scrutiny of intelligence, including parliamentary\u000d\u000a        questions, debates and select committees. This significantly expanded\u000d\u000a        upon existing knowledge. It suggested that in addition to the form and\u000d\u000a        powers of legislative oversight committees, alternative variables in\u000d\u000a        determining the effectiveness of legislative oversight may be the extent\u000d\u000a        to which legislatures are interested in the work of intelligence and\u000d\u000a        security agencies, and the extent of parliamentary knowledge and\u000d\u000a        understanding of intelligence.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The research was carried out by Professor Hugh Bochel (PI) and Dr Andrew\u000d\u000a      Defty (CI). For the parliament and intelligence project a research\u000d\u000a      associate, Dr Andrew Dunn, was appointed in November 2009. Dunn left the\u000d\u000a      University in August 2010 (he returned as a lecturer in Social Policy in\u000d\u000a      April 2013 and is submitted under UOA22) and was replaced by Jane\u000d\u000a      Kirkpatrick.

The School has a history\u000d\u000a      of work on issues around participation and representation in elected\u000d\u000a      bodies that dates back for more than twenty years, and in many cases\u000d\u000a      predates the topicality of these issues. Successive cohorts of staff, all\u000d\u000a      still working in the School, have generated a succession of projects which\u000d\u000a      share an overriding concern with participation and representation, but\u000d\u000a      which are also marked by cross-cutting issues, most notably in relation to\u000d\u000a      the representation of women, electoral turnout, and the application of\u000d\u000a      policies and policy lessons from different tiers of government across the\u000d\u000a      UK and abroad. The research has been funded by a range of external bodies,\u000d\u000a      including the Electoral Commission, the Nuffield Foundation and the\u000d\u000a      British Academy, and has drawn on a wide variety of methods as appropriate\u000d\u000a      to the various topics being examined.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aLocal elections in Scotland &#8212; the collection and analysis of\u000d\u000a        local government election results since 1994 (H.

This research also influenced the\u000d\u000a      adoption and design of new programs and changes to existing programs that\u000d\u000a      have been reviewed independently as having made a positive difference to\u000d\u000a      the lives of ex-combatants and their post-conflict communities. The\u000d\u000a      impacts discussed in this section are on international organization\u000d\u000a      practitioners' thinking and coordination, on international DDR programs\u000d\u000a      and policy, and on ex-combatant access to improved and extended benefits.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on practitioners' thinking, debate, and coordination\u000d\u000a    Dr McMullin's published research and policy reports have informed and\u000d\u000a      stimulated practitioner debate and thinking about DDR program duration,\u000d\u000a      components, and rationale. The researcher is listed as one of only three\u000d\u000a      independent experts consulted in the preparation of a major UN report on\u000d\u000a      DDR, the 2010 `New Horizon Discussion Report on Second Generation DDR',\u000d\u000a      and four of the researcher's publications are cited as recommended reading\u000d\u000a      in the report. The New Horizon process is designed to articulate a\u000d\u000a      high-level, forward agenda for UN peacekeeping. Dr McMullin's research is\u000d\u000a      also mentioned and cited throughout the Discussion Report, as a source of\u000d\u000a      information for advice on how to conduct security monitoring during DDR\u000d\u000a      processes (p.42), how to disarm militias (p.48), and how to structure cash\u000d\u000a      assistance for ex-combatants (p.49). [S3]\u000d\u000a    According to the former Director of the Reintegration, Rehabilitation and\u000d\u000a      Recovery Section of the UN Mission in Liberia, Dr McMullin's reporting and\u000d\u000a      research facilitated discussion and review of policy and practice within\u000d\u000a      the UN Mission of Liberia, because they were `opportunities to discuss and\u000d\u000a      review our modus operandi' [S1]. He also credited the reports with\u000d\u000a      being `quite useful in highlighting a new and more practical \"hands-on\u000d\u000a      approach\" to reintegration, rehabilitation and recovery of ex-combatants'\u000d\u000a      and with identifying and analysing elements of this approach in helpful\u000d\u000a      ways to allow the wider UN system to learn from and model in subsequent\u000d\u000a      missions, especially concerning post-conflict stabilization of high-risk\u000d\u000a      security areas and post-conflict management of natural resources [S1].\u000d\u000a      The 2009 report is singled out for consolidating agreement within the UN\u000d\u000a      system about the importance of a prominent and sustained DPKO role in\u000d\u000a      ex-combatant reintegration, which prior to the programs in Liberia had\u000d\u000a      been mostly the domain of development actors, with DPKO presumed to\u000d\u000a      `provide security only' and not `do development'.\u000d\u000a    The 2011 After Action Review on Burundi (IO1) has had an `impact\u000d\u000a      on thinking and programming not only at DPKO, but also a wider impact for\u000d\u000a      the UN system' [S2, S4]. It `continues to be discussed at the\u000d\u000a      senior level of the UN, including at the joint DPKO-UNDP (UN Development\u000d\u000a      Programme) annual meetings of Senior DDR Managers' and `is singled out for\u000d\u000a      its comprehensive and effective consultation across the UN system and for\u000d\u000a      its analysis-driven approach to assessment and evaluation' and for its\u000d\u000a      `rich history of UN involvement in Burundi that has been used in modelling\u000d\u000a      subsequent programs'. `[UNDP] use the report as a model for the kind of\u000d\u000a      assessment [it seeks] to commission on future projects and programs.' [S2]\u000d\u000a      It `helped to ignite discussion between DPKO, UNDP, and the World Bank on\u000d\u000a      how to improve communication, coordination, and strategy in designing and\u000d\u000a      delivering reintegration for returning populations (including\u000d\u000a      ex-combatants) as well as host communities' [S2]. Conventional\u000d\u000a      wisdom was that World Bank involvement would end after the MDRP, but the\u000d\u000a      2011 report sketched numerous ways in which the Bank's involvement would\u000d\u000a      continue to be useful and needed, and articulated avenues of future\u000d\u000a      cooperation and integration between the UN and World Bank [S2, S4].\u000d\u000a      Finally, the Burundi report analysed the peacebuilding contributions of\u000d\u000a      the UN Peacebuilding Commission and Peacebuilding Fund, noting that\u000d\u000a      because these institutions `were able to commit money to a controversial\u000d\u000a      process that no other donors were willing to fund, a major obstacle to the\u000d\u000a      peace negotiations and peace process was removed, which paved the way for\u000d\u000a      eventual disarmament' of the National Forces of Liberation (FNL) in\u000d\u000a      Burundi [S2]. The report's focus on these issues has `helped the\u000d\u000a      UN system to recognize the value added of the PBC and PBF and also the\u000d\u000a      value of recognizing potential political benefits of providing\u000d\u000a      reintegration assistance' [S2].\u000d\u000a    Impacts on international DDR policy and practice\u000d\u000a    All of the policy reports have structured and stimulated debate within\u000d\u000a      the UN system about the political dilemmas of DDR programming, the\u000d\u000a      linkages between DDR and Security Sector Reform, the nature of beneficiary\u000d\u000a      targeting, and the need for more sustainable, labour-oriented approaches\u000d\u000a      to reintegration [S1 and S2]. All of these were policy\u000d\u000a      recommendations that built on the insights of underpinning research\u000d\u000a      highlighted above. According to a senior UNDP official, a key policy\u000d\u000a      impact of the 2011 Burundi report `has been to further convince the UN\u000d\u000a      system of the need for follow-up livelihood and reintegration support',\u000d\u000a      which `has assisted UNDP in extending its support programs in Burundi' [S2].\u000d\u000a      Research on Liberia resulted in similar policy impacts. The New Horizon\u000d\u000a      Report on Second Generation DDR, relying `extensively' on Dr McMullin's\u000d\u000a      research, was instrumental in moving DPKO towards adoption of the\u000d\u000a      `approaches and programs conceived and utilized in Liberia' and identified\u000d\u000a      and analysed in the 2007 and 2009 policy reports [S1]. The\u000d\u000a      research helped to effect a policy shift at senior levels of the UN by\u000d\u000a      contributing to `widen [UN] understanding of new approaches for assisting\u000d\u000a      ex-combatants', and `advanced UN-wide understanding of the impacts of new\u000d\u000a      initiatives from the field' [S1]. Prior to PI's policy reports,\u000d\u000a      such initiatives were considered `too new' and `too proactive' for a\u000d\u000a      typical UN peacekeeping mission' [S1].\u000d\u000a    The 2007 report (IO3) is singled out as providing crucial\u000d\u000a      guidance for actors in the field about how to proceed in assisting\u000d\u000a      ex-combatants who had been excluded from original programs because of\u000d\u000a      donor and implementing actor errors. It helped to convince UN Headquarters\u000d\u000a      that this `remaining caseload' of ex-combatants should receive assistance,\u000d\u000a      and `influenced UNMIL towards undertaking increased efforts at identifying\u000d\u000a      funding for a final phase of rehabilitation and recovery' in the form of a\u000d\u000a      $12million program for these ex-combatants concluding in 2009 [S1].\u000d\u000a    Welfare impacts for ex-combatants and community beneficiaries\u000d\u000a    Respondents credited the policy reports with identifying key lessons\u000d\u000a      learned and influencing debate and thinking across the UN system in ways\u000d\u000a      that promoted the consolidation of security after war in high-risk areas (IO2\u000d\u000a      and IO3 both recommended the use of careful security monitoring\u000d\u000a      and targeted aid assistance in communities located in vulnerable security\u000d\u000a      areas) and that extended livelihood and social welfare benefits to\u000d\u000a      ex-combatant beneficiaries and their host communities. The impact of the\u000d\u000a      reports' policy recommendations, which were themselves highly informed by\u000d\u000a      the conclusions and data of published research, helped to improve\u000d\u000a      ex-combatant access to programs (given the impact of the 2007 report on\u000d\u000a      the adoption and contours of the follow-up program for the `residual\u000d\u000a      caseload') and helped to improve program provision (given the impacts\u000d\u000a      attributed to the research in terms of generating debate within the UN\u000d\u000a      about program duration and contours).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Reintegrating ex-combatants after war is critical to the success of\u000d\u000a      peacebuilding and it is one of the top priorities for the United Nations\u000d\u000a      during post-war transition. Research on ex-combatant disarmament,\u000d\u000a      demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) by Dr Jaremey McMullin was the\u000d\u000a      basis for three major policy reports for the UN on DDR in Liberia and\u000d\u000a      Burundi.

In 2007, the former head of the UN\u000d\u000a      Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit commissioned Dr McMullin to travel to\u000d\u000a      Liberia to investigate why some ex-combatants there had not accessed\u000d\u000a      formal programming, and to make recommendations for further action. The\u000d\u000a      resulting 27-page policy report (IO3) that Dr McMullin co-authored\u000d\u000a      with a senior UN official was widely disseminated within the UN's\u000d\u000a      Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) at the end of 2007.\u000d\u000a    Dr McMullin's subsequent published research and his continued interaction\u000d\u000a      with practitioners at DPKO led the UN to commission him to research and\u000d\u000a      write two more comprehensive, single-author studies on DDR during the REF\u000d\u000a      cycle. The first was a 34-page report on the lessons learned from DPKO\u000d\u000a      involvement with ex-combatant reintegration programming in Liberia (IO2).\u000d\u000a      The second was a 114-page `After Action Review' funded by the UK's\u000d\u000a      Department for International Development and the World Bank (IO1).\u000d\u000a      `After Action Reviews' are major UN policy documents, and Dr McMullin's\u000d\u000a      2011 After Action Review was commissioned to be a definitive history of UN\u000d\u000a      involvement with ex-combatants in Burundi, a retrospective, high-level\u000d\u000a      evaluation of the impact of the DDR process in Burundi, and a\u000d\u000a      comprehensive assessment of potential threats to security in Burundi to\u000d\u000a      assist the UN in continuing its peace support role there.\u000d\u000a    Key conclusions and insights from Dr McMullin's published research that\u000d\u000a      guided the research design and recommendations of the policy reports and\u000d\u000a      their subsequent impacts on DDR thinking, policy, and practice include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Important data and knowledge about reintegration processes are often\u000d\u000a        lost after the UN withdraws, and the UN needs to do more to monitor and\u000d\u000a        assess progress with ex-combatant reintegration long after formal\u000d\u000a        programming ends and peacekeeping troops withdraw. (R1)\u000a\u000d\u000a      Reintegration should be conceived as more than returning ex-combatants\u000d\u000a        to the lives of poverty that contributed to war in the first place. (R1,\u000a          R2)\u000a\u000d\u000a      Vocational training programs for ex-combatants fail to produce\u000d\u000a        long-term employment and labor-intensive interventions should be\u000d\u000a        prioritized over prevailing neoliberal preferences for macroeconomic\u000d\u000a        stability. (R1, R2)\u000a\u000d\u000a      International and national actors are ill-equipped to manage and\u000d\u000a        resolve reintegration challenges in part because they do not anticipate\u000d\u000a        the `right' challenges (especially with regard to security), but also\u000d\u000a        because they do not see themselves as having a mandate or authority to\u000d\u000a        manage new problems as they arise. (R1, R2)\u000a\u000d\u000a      Modes and processes of political integration tend to be ignored in\u000d\u000a        current approaches, with ex-combatant political protest seen in terms of\u000d\u000a        security threat alone rather than as an expression of political\u000d\u000a        participation. (R1, R2)\u000a\u000d\u000a      Ex-combatants must be viewed as assets to post-conflict reconstruction\u000d\u000a        and not simply as threats to post-conflict communities. They are sources\u000d\u000a        of valuable social capital. They have valuable ideas about\u000d\u000a        reconciliation and reconstruction. (R1, R2)\u000a\u000d\u000a      These insights might seem intuitive, but current reintegration policy\u000d\u000a        and practice is structured in such a way as to promote ex-combatant\u000d\u000a        separation from communities of eturn rather than their integration into\u000d\u000a        communities of return, mainly because ex-combatants are unpopular\u000d\u000a        beneficiaries in the donor community (because they are perceived as\u000d\u000a        having `caused the war' or perpetrated its worst atrocities). (R2)\u000a\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Dr McMullin's research on ex-combatants is a significant addition to the\u000d\u000a      conceptual understanding of a critical peacebuilding task and an essential\u000d\u000a      point of reference for research on ex-combatants. In using theoretical\u000d\u000a      insights from critical theory to problematize current DDR thinking and\u000d\u000a      practice, its major contribution to theory-building lies in its argument\u000d\u000a      that challenges faced by ex-combatants after war must extend beyond\u000d\u000a      orthodox security considerations (which frame ex-combatants merely as\u000d\u000a      threats to the post-conflict order) and instead embrace a richer\u000d\u000a      conceptualization of the reintegration process as one that recognizes\u000d\u000a      ex-combatants' productive capacity. It is also empirically rich, drawing\u000d\u000a      on over 200 interviews with policy practitioners and ex-combatants to\u000d\u000a      identify and analyze reintegration challenges.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning published research has been reviewed as excellent and\u000d\u000a      world leading by prominent academics from multiple countries, including\u000d\u000a      the USA, Sweden, and Norway, and representing multiple disciplines\u000d\u000a      (anthropology, international relations, and area studies). Dr McMullin's\u000d\u000a      policy reports are also significant and high-quality research outputs in\u000d\u000a      their own right. They are data- and theory-driven assessments and analyses\u000d\u000a      of UN action in Liberia and Burundi. They are historical, evaluative, and\u000d\u000a      strategic resources for the UN and its partners. They feature novel\u000d\u000a      methods of analysis (for example, the 2011 Burundi report maps security\u000d\u000a      threats and institutional structures by coding and comparing respondent\u000d\u000a      assessments). All have been widely read by senior UN actors, cited in\u000d\u000a      major subsequent UN publications, and used to model subsequent programs\u000d\u000a      and evaluations.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35295","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of underpinning MECACS research has reached across the\u000d\u000a      social and cultural elites of the Middle East and Central Asia and the\u000d\u000a      Western policymaking leaders, and its significance is exemplified by three\u000d\u000a      key beneficiaries: (i) Governments in the region who are formulating new\u000d\u000a      foreign and security policies; (ii) the social and cultural elites who are\u000d\u000a      playing a role in representing violence and conflict with a view to\u000d\u000a      fostering greater dialogue about past, present and future political\u000d\u000a      transformation; and (iii) individuals and institutions in higher education\u000d\u000a      in the Caucasus and Central Asia that have faced momentous reform from a\u000d\u000a      previous Soviet communist system.

(C5)\u000d\u000a    - SNC's 2005 research on elites and state building has led to her being\u000d\u000a      regularly consulted by the policy making and practitioner community on\u000d\u000a      policy toward Central Asia, e.g. for the EU Commission (2008), US State\u000d\u000a      Department (2009), large corporate actors (2010), Bertelsmann Stiftung\u000d\u000a      (from 2008 annually) and UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office\/Development\u000d\u000a      Office (from 2008 intermittently). The Royal Institute of International\u000d\u000a      Affairs in November 2012 invited forty-five policy-makers, IO\u000d\u000a      representatives, leading scholars, embassy representatives, international\u000d\u000a      business representatives to discuss the findings of SNC's book, Understanding\u000d\u000a        Central Asia, partly to discuss how findings of such a book can best\u000d\u000a      be translated into workable documents for policy-makers on the region,\u000d\u000a      with a follow-up meeting in September 2013 (C4).\u000d\u000a    b) Benefits to constituents that observe or are party to conflicts or\u000d\u000a        intercommunal violence with impacts on creativity, culture and society\u000d\u000a    MECACS underpinning research has benefitted those making policy\u000d\u000a      and those striving to bring greater understanding between different\u000d\u000a      factions involved in violence. RF's UK Conflict Pool-funded analysis of\u000d\u000a      living conditions in Abkhazia after the 2008 war is a critical example: it\u000d\u000a      identified gaps in provisions by intergovernmental and INGO assistance and\u000d\u000a      societal needs and provided the definitive basis for changing actual\u000d\u000a      practice at the communal level. As a different mechanism, RF, with SNC,\u000d\u000a      assembled in St Andrews MECACS seminars high-ranking\u000d\u000a      representatives from countries across the Caucasus lacking diplomatic\u000d\u000a      relations that were publically recorded (such as on embassy websites), for\u000d\u000a      dialogue especially on another intractable conflict, Nagorno-Karabakh\u000d\u000a      (C5). In 2009 SNC was invited to become a Director of the Kyrgyz-British\u000a        Society (KBS), a not-for-profit organization where she regularly\u000d\u000a      participates in cultural events that gather academics, policy-makers, NGOs\u000d\u000a      and interested parties also raising money to benefit charitable\u000d\u000a      organizations in the Kyrgyz Republic: in January 2012 the KBS raised\u000d\u000a      &#163;1,500 for an orphanage in Bishkek. SNC's research on identity and\u000d\u000a      politics (R5) has led to the production of cultural artefacts (a 2008\u000d\u000a      documentary film, Silent Witnesses, produced by SNC) plus the\u000d\u000a      enhancement of cultural presentation (an exhibition of visual art). It has\u000d\u000a      proven useful also to cultural entrepreneurs and civil society\u000d\u000a      organizations who are working to overcome inter-communal violence and\u000d\u000a      poverty. Stakeholders involved in formulating cultural policy in the\u000d\u000a      Kyrgyz Republic &#8212; Ministry of Culture, artists and local communities &#8212;\u000d\u000a      invited SNC in 2008 and 2009 to hold several showings of Silent\u000d\u000a        Witnesses and provide a neutral platform for discussion of sensitive\u000d\u000a      political issues. The May 2013 London exhibition, Ketsin! Art and\u000d\u000a        Revolution in the Kyrgyz Republic, that SNC curated and which ran\u000d\u000a      over 4 days, benefits the artistic community whose output can be used both\u000d\u000a      to increase in the West the overall profile and understanding of a small\u000d\u000a      resource-poor state, the Kyrgyz Republic, and to serve the broader\u000d\u000a      audience consumers who as a result more openly discuss pivotal political\u000d\u000a      events, particularly after Kyrgyzstan 2010 inter-communal violence which\u000d\u000a      left hundreds dead and hundreds of thousands displaced.\u000d\u000a    c) Benefits to individuals and institutions in the region's higher\u000d\u000a        education sector\u000d\u000a    Finally, the underpinning MECACS research described in section 2\u000d\u000a      has influenced and abetted institution- and capacity-building in the MECAC\u000d\u000a      region. SNC and RF participate multiple times a year in two of the Open\u000d\u000a      Society Foundation's flagship programmes, Central Asia Research and\u000d\u000a      Training Initiative (CARTI) and the Academic Fellowship programme (AFP),\u000d\u000a      an involvement which began about 10 years ago. CARTI creates exceptional\u000d\u000a      and transformational opportunities for individual researchers from the\u000d\u000a      region; AFP engages in sustainable reform of academic departments across\u000d\u000a      the region. In 2008 SNC produced an edited book (R6) as part of the AFP\u000d\u000a      programme that for the first time exposed scholars in the Kyrgyz\u000d\u000a      Republic's leading University (AUCA) to a rigorous peer-review process.

In each case the research\u000d\u000a      combines theoretical paradigms with extensive fieldwork employing complex\u000d\u000a      data sets, a mastery of local languages and intensive regional immersion.\u000d\u000a      Findings therefore carry academic significance at the levels of both\u000d\u000a      region and theory, and representative projects are summarised as follows.\u000d\u000a    Conflict Management and Peace-Building\u000d\u000a    Conflict is a tragic everyday reality for many parts of the MECAC region\u000d\u000a      and the research undertaken under the umbrella of MECACS (formed\u000d\u000a      in 2003) has sought to better understand its sources and resolution. Dr\u000d\u000a      Rick Fawn (RF, Senior Lecturer, in post since 1995) has focused on\u000d\u000a      secessionist conflicts in the South Caucasus, Professor Sally Nikoline\u000d\u000a      Cummings (SNC, in post since 2003) on the establishment of order after\u000d\u000a      revolution in Central Asia's Kyrgyz Republic and Professor Ray Hinnebusch\u000d\u000a      (RH, in post since 1996) on the Syrian crisis. Key questions are the\u000d\u000a      conditions in which Western intervention counters or reinforces local\u000d\u000a      instability, and the local conditions that can build a sustainable peace.\u000d\u000a      The key findings that underpinned the impact were: a) explanations of why\u000d\u000a      electoral observation missions to countries attempting to democratize can\u000d\u000a      have the paradoxical impact of strengthening local authoritarianism (R2,\u000d\u000a      R3); b) establishing how Western governments can influence human rights\u000d\u000a      and conflict resolution simultaneously (R4); and c) how international\u000d\u000a      organizations are best structured and managed to influence the\u000d\u000a      democratization agenda (R6).\u000d\u000a    Foreign Policy\u000d\u000a    In globalized and highly penetrated regional systems, and with\u000d\u000a      substantial oil and mineral wealth, the states of the MECAC region\u000d\u000a      negotiate their place as sovereign polities and economies. SNC (R7)\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that factors of identity provided the limits of legitimate\u000d\u000a      foreign behaviour and how within these limits output has been primarily\u000d\u000a      driven by pragmatism not ideology. In 2013 RF formulated the concept of\u000d\u000a      `internal conditionality' for interactions between post-communist states\u000d\u000a      and their inter-relations with pan-European international organisations.\u000d\u000a      RH's Syrian economic and foreign policy nexus (R2) highlighted that\u000d\u000a      significant economic reforms had been initiated but had not been\u000d\u000a      consolidated due to absent political pluralisation, rule of law and\u000d\u000a      excessive rent-seeking (R2). RH (in 2009) further studied the effects of\u000d\u000a      generational change in Syria to lead to a better understanding of the\u000d\u000a      links between generation and foreign policy, enabling a deeper\u000d\u000a      understanding of policy drivers particularly with the succession of Bashar\u000d\u000a      al-Asad (2001-03). R1 explored the conditions (in a hurting stalemate) for\u000d\u000a      effective political intervention in the 2011 Syrian Uprising and concluded\u000d\u000a      that neither side was yet ready to compromise and, without this,\u000d\u000a      intervention would require extensive long-term commitment of resources.\u000d\u000a    Nations, States and Identity\u000d\u000a    At the core of these research clusters of conflict and state-building\u000d\u000a      exists the underlying challenge of constructing and managing identity. SNC\u000d\u000a      (in 2006) looked into both the self-legitimation of elites and the ways in\u000d\u000a      which collective memories of the past are negotiated by societies and\u000d\u000a      leaders. She argues that early memories of state-building create\u000d\u000a      path-dependency in the reform process. R1 on Turkey-Syria relations showed\u000d\u000a      that trans-state interdependencies from shared water, trade and identity\u000d\u000a      groups bridging the border moved from being seen as vulnerabilities to\u000d\u000a      opportunities for mutual gain as the construction of identity changed from\u000d\u000a      depicting the other as \"enemy\" to \"friend.\" The intersections of sub-state\u000d\u000a      conflict, state interests and the efforts of IOs to mediate in post-Soviet\u000d\u000a      conflicts involve nuanced understanding of assertions of rights and\u000d\u000a      responsibilities (R3 and R4). In all cases, collective identities are\u000d\u000a      produced and contested.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35403","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Lord Norton's research on Parliament, and on the legislative process, was\u000a      instrumental in the\u000a      decision of the House of Lords to appoint him in 2001 as the founding\u000a      Chairman of the Select\u000a      Committee on the Constitution. Under his chairmanship, the committee\u000a      produced three major\u000a      reports, plus numerous reports on Bills brought before the House, one of\u000a      the most significant being\u000a      Parliament and the Legislative Process. His successor as chairman,\u000a      Lord Holme of Cheltenham,\u000a      described Lord Norton not only as a `hands-on chairman' but a `hands-on\u000a      keyboard chairman'\u000a      because of his drafting of the committee's reports: Lord Norton undertook\u000a      much or all of the writing\u000a      himself. He authored the report on Parliament and the Legislative\u000a        Process, the initial draft being\u000a      accepted with all but minor amendments.\u000a    Lord Norton's extensive, authoritative research on post-legislative\u000a      scrutiny, parliamentary\u000a      procedures and the legislative process has been cited in numerous other\u000a      parliamentary committee\u000a      reports. The impact of Norton's body of research in this field is such\u000a      that in 2010 the Commons'\u000a      Public Administration Select Committee not only took evidence from him in\u000a      one of its inquiries, but\u000a      also appointed him a Specialist Adviser to the Committee to assist in\u000a      completing its report. He has\u000a      been invited to appear before numerous parliamentary committees to give\u000a      evidence,\u000a      overwhelmingly in respect of parliamentary processes including\u000a      post-legislative scrutiny. His most\u000a      recent appearances (November 2012, March 2013) were before the Procedure\u000a      Committee and the\u000a      Public Administration Select Committee of the House of Commons to advise\u000a      respectively on\u000a      reforming the procedure for Private Members' Bills and on reform of the\u000a      civil service. Norton's\u000a      production of this body of research also led to him being appointed by the\u000a      House of Lords as a\u000a      member of various Joint Committees appointed to examine draft Bills.\u000a    The Government acknowledged the importance of Norton's 2004 report's\u000a      recommendations\u000a      regarding post-legislative scrutiny and in response to the report asked\u000a      the Law Commission to\u000a      review the options. The Law Commission included the subject in its ninth\u000a      programme and began\u000a      work in July 2005. It issued a consultation paper and, following informal\u000a      discussions between the\u000a      Chairman and Lord Norton, asked Lord Norton to submit a memorandum. Lord\u000a      Norton's\u000a      submission developed the recommendations embodied in the Select\u000a      Committee's report. His\u000a      submission formed the most substantial part of the Law Commission's report\u000a      (No. 302), published\u000a      in 2006, the Commission repeating and endorsing his recommendations.\u000a      Indeed, its section on\u000a      parliamentary post-legislative review merits repetition: `We endorse the\u000a      approach of Lord Norton of\u000a      Louth' (para. 3.31), `Lord Norton of Louth produced a detailed and\u000a      considered argument... We\u000a      endorse his approach and summarise his main arguments below' (para. 3.36),\u000a      and, in its\u000a      conclusion to the section, `Our proposal mirrors that put forward by Lord\u000a      Norton in his paper to us\u000a      and we can do no better than conclude by adopting Lord Norton's\u000a      conclusion..' (para. 3.80, Law\u000a      Commission, Post-Legislative Scrutiny, No.302.)\u000a    The Government published its response in March 2008, accepting that Acts\u000a      should normally be\u000a      reviewed three to five years after enactment. The reviews would be carried\u000a      out by the relevant\u000a      Government Department, published as Command Papers, and submitted to the\u000a      relevant\u000a      Departmental Select Committees in the House of Commons. It would then be\u000a      up to the relevant\u000a      Select Committee whether it wished to pursue the issue.\u000a    The Cabinet Office subsequently produced detailed guidance for\u000a      Departments. The first two Acts\u000a      to be reviewed (in 2008) were the Electoral Registration (Northern\u000a      Ireland) Act 2005 (Cm 7504)\u000a      and the Railways Act 2005 (Cm 7660). By the conclusion of the Parliament,\u000a      seven Acts had been\u000a      subject to review. Post-legislative review is now an established\u000a      procedure, accepted and\u000a      continued by the Coalition Government and enshrined in the Cabinet\u000a        Manual. The beneficiaries\u000a      are both legislators and those who benefit from post legislative scrutiny\u000a      &#8212; UK citizens,\u000a      administrators, parliament, the civil service, and the judiciary.\u000a    The impact of this body of research on the design and implementation of\u000a      post-legislative scrutiny\u000a      by Parliament was acknowledged in the House of Lords by the then-Deputy\u000a      Leader of the House,\u000a      Lord Hunt of King's Heath. The review of Acts by Departments constitutes a\u000a      major contribution,\u000a      though not quite fulfilling all of the recommendations made by Lord Norton\u000a      for post-legislative\u000a      scrutiny. Norton's research on the need for a dedicated parliamentary\u000a      committee for post-legislative\u000a      scrutiny is being pursued with Government. The 2012-13 parliamentary\u000a      session has\u000a      seen some movement in both Houses. At the start of the session, the House\u000a      of Lords established a\u000a      committee to undertake post-legislative scrutiny of Acts dealing with\u000a      adoption; more are being\u000a      appointed in 2013-14. In the Commons, the Justice Committee initiated an\u000a      inquiry into the\u000a      Freedom of Information Act following receipt of the post-legislative\u000a      review of the Act.\u000a    Lord Norton's research on legislative scrutiny has been drawn on not only\u000a      by the committees that\u000a      invited him to give evidence, but also by others in the course of\u000a      examining the legislative practices\u000a      and the procedures.

Such\u000a      scrutiny was non-existent\u000a      before 2008, but was adopted following the impact of Norton's body of\u000a      research on\u000a      parliamentary reports, Norton's submissions to the Law Commission, and the\u000a      subsequent\u000a      endorsement by the UK Government and Parliament. For many years, Norton\u000a      has produced what\u000a      is widely recognised as the world-leading research into the legislative\u000a      processes of the UK\u000a      Parliament, including the procedures and monitoring of legislation from\u000a      both Houses. The resulting\u000a      body of research has appeared not only in books and articles but also\u000a      through publication by a\u000a      number of parliamentary and other public bodies (see section 3, item 3\u000a      below). This significant\u000a      body of work forms one aspect of a broader research output by members of\u000a      the Centre for\u000a      Legislative Studies on the House of Commons, which has transformed\u000a      fundamentally the\u000a      understandings of parliamentary structures and behaviour, possessed both\u000a      by practitioners and by\u000a      academics. Norton's publications in this field have influenced many\u000a      practising politicians, a point\u000a      made by the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow's introduction to\u000a      Norton's Speaker's\u000a      1911 Centenary Lectures, given in the Speaker's State Rooms in 2011.\u000a    Before 2008, there was no systematic evaluation of the impact of\u000a      legislation in the UK once it had\u000a      been enacted. In 1999 the then-Leader of the Opposition, William Hague MP\u000a      appointed Norton to\u000a      chair a Commission on Strengthening Parliament, operating independently of\u000a      the Conservative\u000a      Party. Norton drew upon and extended his published body of research on the\u000a      legislative process to\u000a      shape the inquiry and the resulting report on post-legislative scrutiny,\u000a      pre-legislative scrutiny and\u000a      the legislative process in Parliament. The report of the `Norton\u000a      Commission', Strengthening\u000a        Parliament, was published in 2000 and debated in the House of\u000a      Commons. Hague announced that\u000a      it would be a `route map' for future Conservative governments. The\u000a      then-Leader of the House of\u000a      Commons Robin Cook drew on this research in 2001, referring to it in\u000a      various public speeches as\u000a      well as meeting Lord Norton to discuss how to take the proposals forward.\u000a      Norton continued this\u000a      research through his academic writings and in his authorship of the report\u000a      of the House of Lords\u000a      Constitution Committee in 2004 on Parliament and the Legislative\u000a        Process. The latter\u000a      recommended that post-legislative scrutiny should become the norm, with\u000a      Acts being subjected to\u000a      Parliamentary review to determine whether they had achieved their intended\u000a      purpose, such\u000a      reviews being carried out three years after commencement or six years\u000a      after enactment, whichever\u000a      was the sooner. These measures were adopted in 2008, and have impacted on\u000a      the daily work of\u000a      UK government since that time.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35408","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"203312","Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"366755","Name":"Sudan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1820814","Name":"Brunei"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The influence of the body of research extends into the military and\u000a      military and defence academies\u000a      of a number of countries throughout the world. These texts and other\u000a      collections in Ashgate's\u000a      Military and Defence Ethics series, edited by the MEEN research\u000a      team, have become standard\u000a      points of reference for discussion of military ethics education in\u000a      military and defence academies\u000a      around the world. The research of the project has also dovetailed with the\u000a      work of the International\u000a      Society for Military Ethics, originally US-based and now with a European\u000a      branch inaugurated in\u000a      conjunction with MEEN. This ensures dissemination wherever military ethics\u000a      education is\u000a      practised. The impact of this research is attested to by a Senior Lecturer\u000a      from the Defence Studies\u000a      Department of the Joint Services Command and Staff College, in the UK\u000a      Defence College,\u000a      Shrivenham: `Books in the Ethics Education series are in the Staff College\u000a      library and are used\u000a      extensively by students researching aspects of ethics and law education\u000a      and training in the\u000a      military. These aren't \"normal\" students, but those studying on the\u000a      Advanced Command and Staff\u000a      Course preparing for senior leadership positions and therefore with\u000a      influence on the way the\u000a      profession develops in the future...I have seen MEEN-related publications\u000a      cited in Canada, Serbia,\u000a      Brazil and even Colombia by professionals involved in military training\u000a      and education'. This picture\u000a      is endorsed by a Senior Lecturer from the Royal Military Academy\u000a      Sandhurst, when he writes (see\u000a      section 5 below): `I have taken some of the ethical insights highlighted\u000a      by my membership of\u000a      MEEN to countries such as the Congo, Sudan, Brunei, Saudi Arabia and many\u000a      others'; moreover,\u000a      `The MEEN edited volumes are widely consulted here by British Army officer\u000a      students at the\u000a      RMAS'.\u000a    Prior to the work of MEEN, ethics education in the military was typically\u000a      seen as peripheral and\u000a      generally entrusted (depending on location and service) to\u000a      non-specialists, chaplains or their\u000a      equivalents and regarded as essentially a matter of private morality. This\u000a      has changed, partly as a\u000a      result of changing forms, means, purposes and theatres of warfare,\u000a      together with a different\u000a      understanding of the roles and responsibilities of both officers and other\u000a      military personnel. MEEN\u000a      has been at the forefront of thinking through the implications of these\u000a      changes. Hence the welcome\u000a      given to the project both in supporting its research and also in the\u000a      activity of disseminating and\u000a      drawing on it, its personnel and its publications. The impact is\u000a      acknowledge thus, by the Stockdale\u000a      Professor of Professional Military Ethics of the US Naval War College (see\u000a      section 5): `it is safe to\u000a      say that no other group has as much knowledge of the ways ethics education\u000a      in the military is\u000a      approached and delivered globally as does the MEEN group...I'm not aware\u000a      of any other individual\u000a      or group who have made a systematic comparative study on an international\u000a      level'. This impact is\u000a      corroborated by a Senior Lecturer (UK Defence College, Shrivenham; see\u000a      section 5): `MEEN did\u000a      the very necessary job of asking the right questions at just the right\u000a      time thus prompting much\u000a      thought within different militaries and by those academics interested in\u000a      studying them'.\u000a    A key part of the MEEN research has been the identification and spreading\u000a      of good practice\u000a      through the military academies of the world as well as having direct\u000a      contact with military personnel\u000a      on active service. This has been done continuously through personal\u000a      contact, consultation, visits,\u000a      conferences, email and other exchanges and publications. Impact can be\u000a      grouped under four\u000a      categories: ethics in training and education; ethics as an integral part\u000a      of military reasoning; pre-deployment\u000a      briefings; post-deployment briefings and interviews.\u000a    Indicatively: the importance of the International Network for the Study\u000a      of Ethics Education in the\u000a      Military and the UoA's significance in its creation and operations is\u000a      attested to by the Stockdale\u000a      Center for Ethics and Leadership of the US Naval Academy (see section 5)\u000a      who writes: `in addition\u000a      to improving pedagogical practice, the network became known as a community\u000a      of scholarly inquiry\u000a      devoted to exploring some of the most significant contemporary issues\u000a      within the field of military\u000a      ethics itself', evidence `suggest[s] that [its relevant outputs'] impact\u000a      has been likewise international\u000a      and widespread'. Moreover, `the collaboration fostered by this project\u000a      resulted in establishing in\u000a      Europe and the UK a new chapter of the International Society of Military\u000a      Ethics...This simply would\u000a      not have occurred without the support and active engagement of the\u000a      original participants in MEEN'.\u000a    \u000a      \u000aEthics in training and education. The curricula of a number of\u000a        military academies include\u000a        reference to the MEEN programme and its outputs. In particular, the\u000a        value and use of case studies\u000a        has been developed and refined; dependence on the notion that ethics is\u000a        imbibed as part of\u000a        character training and development without the need for explicit\u000a        consideration of ethical reasoning\u000a        has been successfully challenged; consideration of the integration of\u000a        ethics into the curriculum and\u000a        training for officers has affected the provision of training. An Ethics\u000a          Education in the Military model\u000a        education programme is being developed and will be used as a template\u000a        for setting up courses of\u000a        study in the emerging democracies and elsewhere. This includes\u000a        dissemination of best practice,\u000a        e.g. consideration of the use of the Krigskollen (Norway Military\u000a        academy) model in constructing a\u000a        military ethics teaching programme at the Romanian Military academy\u000a        (ongoing). Practice and\u000a        curriculum design in the established military academies who are active\u000a        members of (or closely\u000a        associated with) the network continue to be modified and developed in\u000a        consequence of discussion\u000a        and consultation with the members of the project (see section 5 below).\u000a      \u000aEthics as an integral component of military reasoning. Active\u000a        consultations and engagements\u000a        with the military have influenced directly the way in which serving\u000a        officers think about ethical issues\u000a        integral to military practice. This occurred through engagement with\u000a        those directly employed to\u000a        teaching military ethics or to train character development, and high\u000a        ranking officers in the armed\u000a        forces pushing the military ethics education agenda. Examples include\u000a        Commodore Keble, Royal\u000a        Navy, engagements with the French Army and Air Force, the US army, air\u000a        force, and navy, the\u000a        Canadian army. (See letters from Stockdale Center for Ethics and\u000a        Leadership cited in section 5).\u000a      \u000aPre-deployment briefings. The preparation and training that\u000a        officers received prior to military\u000a        engagement in the past typically did not include explicit reference to\u000a        ethics and ethical reasoning\u000a        as such. The MEEN project has helped introduce an explicit ethics\u000a        component in pre-deployment\u000a        training, and has, by invitation, taken part in pre-deployment\u000a        briefings. (See letter from the\u000a        Commodore of the Royal Navy cited in section 5.)\u000a      \u000aPost-deployment de-briefings and interviews. These took place\u000a        both in the initial phases of the\u000a        research, feeding in to understanding of the nature of the problems and\u000a        challenges of ethics\u000a        education in the military, and also in its later phases, at which point\u000a        feedback on MEEN research\u000a        was directly forthcoming from active military participants. The sessions\u000a        were also, in themselves,\u000a        regarded as valuable by many participants in enhancing their own ethical\u000a        awareness. (See letter\u000a        from the Senior Lecturer, Royal Military Academy, section 5).\u000a    \u000a    Dissemination events\u000a    The MEEN project has disseminated lessons from its research directly to\u000a      members of the group\u000a      through conferences, workshops and other forums, and to the military more\u000a      generally through\u000a      briefings, interviews and discussions, and publication in Ashgate's Military\u000a        and Defence Ethics\u000a      series.

This impact has been\u000a      achieved through two\u000a      main routes. The first comprises the impact of MEEN research on the\u000a      teaching of ethics education\u000a      in military and war colleges in Europe, North America, Australia and\u000a      Israel.

A\u000a      concerted impact programme developed from 2005 onwards, with the running\u000a      of practitioner-oriented\u000a      conferences and workshops on ethics education and the military. Two\u000a      `Ethics Training and\u000a      Development in the Military' workshops were held at the University of Hull\u000a      in June 2006 and May\u000a      2007 (funded by grant income totalling &#163;10,863 from the Arts and\u000a      Humanities Research Council)\u000a      and in conjunction with Hull's Institute of Applied Ethics, a research and\u000a      impact initiative that itself\u000a      includes several MEEN members. These workshops brought together academics,\u000a      serving officers\u000a      from armed forces around the world, and military and civilian teachers of\u000a      military ethics in military\u000a      academies and war colleges. Ten countries were represented (Australia,\u000a      Canada, France,\u000a      Germany, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, UK, USA). Findings and\u000a      research presented at the\u000a      workshops were disseminated through the volume Ethics Education in the\u000a        Military, which laid the\u000a      foundation of and became an essential reference for discussion of military\u000a      ethics education around\u000a      the world. It was became the first in a series of books on military ethics\u000a      produced by members of\u000a      the UoA. The conferences and the volumes stimulated the formation of the\u000a      `International Network\u000a      for the Study of Ethics Education in the Military', and has become a key\u000a      medium for the interaction\u000a      of practitioners and academics in the field (see section 4, below).\u000a    The most recent stage of the MEEN project was conceived under the aegis\u000a      of the Institute for\u000a      Applied Ethics and led by Professor James Connelly. A three-year &#163;82,163\u000a      research grant was\u000a      awarded in 2008 by the Leverhulme Trust (Ref: F\/00 181\/O). Research on the\u000a      Leverhulme project\u000a      commenced in the autumn of 2008, with the key researchers at Hull being\u000a      Connelly (Project\u000a      Leader) and Don Carrick (Project administrator). Important contributions\u000a      were made also by Hull-based\u000a      academics in War and Security Studies, David Lonsdale, Christopher Martin\u000a      and Caroline\u000a      Kennedy. The project was inaugurated at the French Military Academy, St\u000a      Cyr in June 2008, at an\u000a      event attended by leading MEEN associates. The next phase comprised first,\u000a      the establishment of\u000a      the role and importance of ethical understanding on active service;\u000a      secondly, research into the\u000a      most appropriate ways of provided ethical training and education to\u000a      military personnel. Hence, in\u000a      April 2009, interviews were conducted with officers at Tern Hill barracks\u000a      both pre and post-Afghanistan\u000a      deployment. This was followed by teaching observation and interviews at\u000a      the UK\u000a      Defence Academy, Shrivenham in November 2008 and interviews and\u000a      participant observation in\u000a      training exercises `Exercise Broadsword', at Sandhurst Military Academy\u000a      training camp. At this\u000a      point the international dimension of the research project was developed\u000a      further, with an extended\u000a      research trip to the USA and Canada in early 2010. Activities included\u000a      teaching observation,\u000a      interviews with officers, interviews with cadets, interviews with teachers\u000a      and trainers. Places visited\u000a      included: Royal Military College of Canada; Army Ethics Education,\u000a      University of Ottawa; US\u000a      Military Academy, West Point; US Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs; US\u000a      Naval Academy,\u000a      Annapolis; National Defense University, Washington DC; US Naval War\u000a      College. During this visit,\u000a      members of MEEN were consulted and interviewed. Work in the UK continued\u000a      with interviews with\u000a      serving officers and troops at Catterick Barracks (March 2010) and with\u000a      Royal Navy and Royal\u000a      Marines chaplains in Exeter and Plymouth (May 2010). Teaching observations\u000a      and curriculum\u000a      discussions continued with visits to the Dutch Military Academy (NLDA),\u000a      Breda, Netherlands in\u000a      early 2011 and to the Krigskollen (Norwegian Defence Academy), Oslo,\u000a      Norway.\u000a    Findings were, and continue to be, disseminated and discussed in papers\u000a      presented to\u000a      conferences and meetings with serving officers. Through this dialogue they\u000a      entered the\u000a      mainstream of ethical discussion in both the academy and the military.\u000a    The findings of the body of research can be summarised as follows:\u000a    \u000a      Pre-deployment ethics briefings are now increasingly integral parts of\u000a        pre-deployment\u000a        preparation\u000a      Convergence on the view that ethical training in the armed forces\u000a        should be an integrated\u000a        part of training\u000a      Retreat from excessive reliance on individual character development\u000a        and\/or institutional\u000a        ethos\u000a      Recognition of need for the development and teaching of moral\u000a        reasoning (rather than\u000a        moral philosophy or the `moral compass' view)\u000a    \u000a    Appreciation of the value of case studies when developing abilities to\u000a      resolve ethical dilemmas.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35409","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"932692","Name":"Lesotho"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of this body of research falls within the general area of\u000a      parliamentary public engagement, and specifically the ways parliaments\u000a      utilise internet-based tools to communicate and engage with the public.\u000a      The impact has been two-fold: 1. It has raised awareness of the contextual\u000a      variables of each parliament that have significant relevance to their use\u000a      internet-based tools; and 2. It has helped to develop and disseminate an\u000a      understanding of how the internet can be used to communicate and engage\u000a      citizens most effectively, whilst accepting the challenges this creates\u000a      for parliaments. In a context where parliaments have been criticised\u000a      heavily for being needlessly distant from citizens, and often identified\u000a      as key causes of political disengagement, the significance of this\u000a      research is particularly great. It provides a framework through which to\u000a      better understand the role played by parliaments, as well as the tools\u000a      available to address this issue. This impact has been both direct, through\u000a      advice and evidence given, and indirect through publications, and spans\u000a      several countries thereby having considerable reach. Institutionally, the\u000a      impact grew out of a 2007 British Academy and ESRC-funded workshop\u000a      Leston-Bandeira co-coordinated with the Oxford Internet Institute. One of\u000a      the primary aims of this event was to bring together the academic and the\u000a      practitioner communities, and included the participation of parliamentary\u000a      officials from six parliaments. This was the first occasion on which there\u000a      had been discussions between academics and parliamentary officials\u000a      regarding the latter's practice in this area. It led to the publication\u000a      online of Parliaments in the Digital Age, which identified some of\u000a      the challenges facing parliaments in the utilisation of internet-based\u000a      tools. The body of research of which this publication was a part became\u000a      even more visible to the practitioner community during the months of\u000a      preparation for the Second World e-Parliament Conference, Brussels,\u000a      November 2008. Leston-Bandeira was invited to represent the academic\u000a      community at this key practitioners' gathering, and to present the\u000a      findings of the UoA's research into parliamentary use of the internet. The\u000a      2008 World e-Parliament expanded those contacts, not least by building a\u000a      closer rapport with practitioners in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies,\u000a      something that has grown significantly since that conference. Hence, the\u000a      Coordinator of the Brazilian Parliament's e-Democracia Program describes\u000a      the body of research's impact as `fundamental to the formulation and\u000a      implementation of the e-Democracia website' (see section 5, below) This\u000a      tool is recognised by practitioners and academics across the world as the\u000a      most complex and effective participative tool developed by a parliament.\u000a      The close collaboration with this parliament has led more recently to\u000a      Leston-Bandeira being invited to deliver a guest lecture and lead a number\u000a      of meetings with Chamber staff on participation, parliaments and citizens,\u000a      with a strong focus on the internet's role.\u000a    At the time of the 2008 World e-Parliament Conference, the Guidelines\u000a      on Parliamentary Websites, issued by the Inter-Parliamentary Union,\u000a      were under review. Having presented aspects of the body of research at a\u000a      session dedicated to this exercise, the coordinators asked Leston-\u000a      Bandeira to submit evidence to this review. The recognition of the value\u000a      of the UoA's research on parliamentary use of the internet led to further\u000a      involvement with the review network, which resulted in turn in an\u000a      invitation to give a keynote lecture on parliamentary websites at the\u000a      Fourth World e-Parliament Conference, Johannesburg, South Africa, October\u000a      2010. The conference was attended by over 400 representatives from more\u000a      than 80 different countries. This presentation was very important in\u000a      cementing contacts with parliamentary officials from a wide range of\u000a      countries both in Europe and beyond. The presentation focused on her\u000a      research into the challenges that websites present to parliaments, and how\u000a      to best overcome these challenges. The lecture and research was commended\u000a      as one of the best presentations in the conference and led many\u000a      parliamentary officials, including the Speaker of the Lesotho parliament,\u000a      to contact her to discuss their own cases.\u000a    As a direct consequence of this presentation, two specific parliaments\u000a      (Israeli and Belgian) contacted Leston-Bandeira regarding their policies\u000a      on new media. At the time, the Israeli parliament was undertaking a\u000a      comprehensive review of its website and associated new media tools. As\u000a      part of this exercise, the Knesset wished to apply to its own case the\u000a      insights gained from the UoA's research. Together with the main leading\u000a      members of his ICT team, the Director General of the Knesset travelled to\u000a      Hull for an extensive meeting with Leston-Bandeira to discuss their\u000a      policies. These discussions continued by email, and had direct impact not\u000a      merely on the renewal of the Knesset website, but also on their decisions\u000a      regarding both the use of social media and the processes underpinning the\u000a      management of these tools. In particular, it led directly to the Knesset's\u000a      current focus on the idea of communicating politics issues in non-partisan\u000a      ways to the public, rather than merely `informing' the public. This\u000a      approach is evident not merely in their new website and social media, but\u000a      also in the re-organisation of their services. This team from the Israeli\u000a      parliament showcased their changes at the recent Fifth World e-Parliament\u000a      Conference in Rome, September 2012, with Leston-Bandeira in attendance.\u000a      This impact is acknowledged in a letter from the Director General (cited\u000a      below, in section 5): for example, `I am confident that, like other\u000a      parliaments around the world, the products of your invaluable academic\u000a      work will continue to have either a direct or an indirect impact on our\u000a      activities here at the Knesset.'\u000a    Similarly, the Belgian parliament examined social media with a view to\u000a      deciding whether or not to develop its use, and if so, in what way.\u000a      Leston-Bandeira had several face-to-face and email discussions with the\u000a      leaders of Belgian parliament's ICT team, regarding the UoA's research. In\u000a      May 2011, as hosts of a workshop on Parliaments and the Net for\u000a      the European Centre for Parliamentary Research and Documentation (the main\u000a      network for parliamentary officials in Europe), the Belgian parliament\u000a      asked Leston-Bandeira to present the conclusions of the body of research\u000a      as the keynote Guest Opening Talk on `Parliament and Public Engagement'.\u000a      Leston-Bandeira was the only academic allowed to participate in this\u000a      conference, which was attended by over 80 parliamentary officials from 16\u000a      European countries. Besides extending the research's impact to the Dutch,\u000a      Finnish and French parliaments among others, this conference also\u000a      reinforced of the UoA's contacts with the UK Houses of Parliament. This\u000a      impacted on the way they started to use social media to engage with the\u000a      public, not least through the creation of the Parliamentary tweeter\u000a      account, and, quoting the adviser to the IT Department of the Belgium\u000a      Parliament (see section 5), `the decision not to take part in any\u000a      other social media activities'.\u000a    The Special Projects Manager for the UK Parliament's Outreach Service\u000a      describes the UoA's research as `an absolutely vital foundation for me to\u000a      develop our programme', a view reinforced by numerous reports and select\u000a      committee proceedings of the UK Parliament (see section 5 below).\u000a    This impact stems from a number of activities:\u000a    \u000a      In July 2011 Leston-Bandeira submitted written evidence to the\u000a        Administration Committee on their enquiry into the planned new Visitors\u000a        Centre, identifying practice in other parliaments in the area of\u000a        parliamentary engagement; In 2012, she was invited to be the only\u000a        academic in a practitioners panel on public engagement at the Study of\u000a        Parliament Group, to talk about the implications of her research for the\u000a        specific constraints that shape parliaments' public engagement; In 2012\u000a        she drew on the research when submitting invited written evidence to the\u000a        Liaison Committee for their enquiry into Select Committee Powers and\u000a        Effectiveness;\u000a      In March 2012, she was invited as one out of three academics to a\u000a        private meeting between the Backbench Business Committee and the Hansard\u000a        Society to discuss the new e-petitions system. This meeting, and\u000a        particularly the advice drawn from the research referred to here,\u000a        resulted in the Hansard Society report What next for e-petitions?,\u000a        which included recommendations to address some of the current weaknesses\u000a        of the e-petitions system;\u000a      She was commissioned to develop a project, from April 2012 to January\u000a        2013, funded by the Higher Education Academy, in partnership with the\u000a        Houses of Parliament's Outreach Service examining ways in which\u000a        web-based parliamentary resources can be used more effectively to\u000a        support University teaching and research. This has altered the Service's\u000a        use of the website.\u000a    \u000a    Further recognition of the impact of Leston-Bandeira's research at\u000a      international level is also evident in the fact that she was invited as an\u000a      academic member of the Senior Advisory Committee of the AGORA &#8212; Portal for\u000a      Parliamentary Development &#8212; an online platform with a membership spanning\u000a      parliaments worldwide that supports the exchange of information and advice\u000a      on issues relating to parliamentary assistance, with a strong focus on the\u000a      relationship with citizens. She has also provided direct advice to Global\u000a      Partners &amp; Associates (GPA), which supports parliamentary\u000a      strengthening in developing parliaments. This included advice and research\u000a      for the Global Report on Parliamentary Representation published in\u000a      June 2012 on the main issues affecting today's relationship between\u000a      parliaments and citizens, which GPA produced for the\u000a      Inter-Parliamentary Union (the main international organisation with\u000a      representation of all national parliaments).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study focuses on the impact of the UoA's research on\u000a      parliamentary public engagement, particularly the body of research on the\u000a      use of internet-based tools by parliaments, produced by Leston-Bandeira\u000a      within the Centre for Legislative Studies, This research has been\u000a      disseminated through national and international `insider' practitioner\u000a      networks, with the research having both direct and indirect impacts on the\u000a      way certain parliaments have used these tools to communicate and engage\u000a      with citizens.

Some of this literature has taken the parliamentary\u000a      institution as its object of research; however, few if any studies analyse\u000a      the specifics of this institution. The UoA's body of research has produced\u000a      such notable impact because it contains some of very few assessments of\u000a      the potential and challenges offered by internet-based tools, focusing\u000a      specifically on parliamentary institutions. The relevant body of research\u000a      began to be created in the mid-2000s when Leston-Bandeira started to focus\u000a      on parliamentary reform, particularly as that affects relationships\u000a      between parliaments and citizens. At the time, the research concentrated\u000a      on how the Portuguese parliament could enhance the individual mandate of\u000a      MPs so as to promote more effective relationships between parliament and\u000a      citizens. The research had considerable impact on the Portuguese\u000a      parliament, with the 2007 reform of their parliamentary procedures drawing\u000a      heavily on this research. Since then Leston-Bandeira's research has\u000a      centred increasingly on the use of internet-based tools to facilitate\u000a      parliaments' engagement with the public. This led to the publication of\u000a      her 2007 article on `The Impact of the Internet on Parliament' in the\u000a      journal Parliamentary Affairs, which added a comparative angle to\u000a      the body of research, rather than focusing solely on the Portuguese case.\u000a      Since RAE2008, the UoA's body of research has continued to develop around\u000a      issues of how many other parliaments utilise the internet to support their\u000a      engagement with the public. Its main contribution has been to show that\u000a      parliaments have specific characteristics which distinguish them\u000a      significantly from other political institutions, especially in relation to\u000a      their use of the internet. The research has also shown that, whilst\u000a      pressures have increased to make parliaments more open and transparent,\u000a      the new possibilities created for parliaments by the growth of the\u000a      internet have also increased those parliaments' vulnerability in numerous\u000a      significant ways. The research developed through the UoA's Economic and\u000a      Social Research Council-funded project, Managing Parliament's Image.\u000a      This project consisted primarily of empirical research into the ways\u000a      parliaments use internet-based tools to communicate with the public. It\u000a      gave the UoA access to important practitioners' networks, through which\u000a      the body of research has impacted directly on parliaments' policies\u000a      relating to the definition and use of websites and social media in their\u000a      relationship with citizens. Besides this direct impact, other recent\u000a      publications have been very well received by various practitioners (as\u000a      well as academics), not least an edited double issue of The Journal of\u000a        Legislative Studies on Parliaments and Citizens, and\u000a      Leston-Bandeira's article `The Pursuit of Legitimacy as a Key Driver for\u000a      Public Engagement', in Parliamentary Affairs.\u000a    The most salient results of the body of research include the following.\u000a      The research identifies clearly which factors distinguish parliamentary\u000a      institutions from other political institutions such as government and\u000a      political parties, in terms of its ability to communicate with the public\u000a      through internet-based tools. For example, a parliament does not have a\u000a      single voice; it encompasses many different groups, which often have\u000a      different if not opposing agendas; it is a collective institution.\u000a      Furthermore, it is the most visible institution in a democratic political\u000a      system. Besides this, parliament as an institution needs to maintain a\u000a      non-biased position at all times when communicating with the public; that\u000a      is, it needs to be politically-engaging, whilst not demonstrating any\u000a      political leaning. All of these characteristics tend to hinder a\u000a      parliament's ability to communicate effectively using internet-based\u000a      tools. This research shows that, although parliaments are often the most\u000a      visible of our political institutions, they are also the ones for whom it\u000a      is most difficult to engage in effective communication with the public.\u000a      Furthermore, parliaments are complex and relatively stagnant institutions;\u000a      this creates difficulties when it comes to utilising internet-based tools,\u000a      as technology tends to change quickly. Moreover, this body of research\u000a      highlights the importance of systemic variables such as electoral system\u000a      or democratic development in determining the opportunities internet-based\u000a      tools create for parliaments; in short, it shows that off-line variables\u000a      are key to the effectiveness of these tools.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35811","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The work outlined in this submission has made a contribution to better\u000d\u000a      understanding of an aspect of police work that has previously been given\u000d\u000a      little academic attention: police custody in Scotland. Dissemination to\u000d\u000a      date has raised the profile of police custody as an arena in which the\u000d\u000a      opportunity to change lives for the better is possible rather than its\u000d\u000a      more traditional portrayal as a negative setting that exemplifies failure\u000d\u000a      in society. The principal beneficiaries of the impact are detained\u000d\u000a      persons, as the research identifies how police and healthcare practice\u000d\u000a      directly affects them whilst highlighting how better risk and stress\u000d\u000a      management practice for police and healthcare professionals is beneficial\u000d\u000a      for all parties. The research provides, for the first time, a\u000d\u000a      comprehensive insight into the nature of the Scottish custody environment,\u000d\u000a      its risks and opportunities.

A senior figure at the new body,\u000d\u000a      Police Scotland, has expressed the view that the findings of the report\u000d\u000a      have already served to convince Cabinet Ministers, Scottish government and\u000d\u000a      police forces of the merits of the pilot approach followed in Tayside\u000d\u000a      [corroborating evidence 5.2].\u000d\u000a    The research provides the Scottish Government with knowledge to inform\u000d\u000a      the means of delivering its stated strategic objectives. Two of the five\u000d\u000a      defined objectives are highly relevant to the issue of medical services\u000d\u000a      provided to people in police custody and highlight the contribution of\u000d\u000a      this research:\u000d\u000a    (1) Healthier\u000d\u000a    Help people to sustain and improve their health, especially in\u000d\u000a      disadvantaged communities, ensuring better, local and faster access to\u000d\u000a      health care.\u000d\u000a    (2) Safer and Stronger\u000d\u000a    Help local communities to flourish, becoming stronger, safer place to\u000d\u000a      live, offering improved opportunities and a better quality of life to\u000d\u000a      sustain and improve their health, especially in disadvantaged communities,\u000d\u000a      ensuring better, local and faster access to health care.\u000d\u000a    A high proportion of those who are taken in to police custody are from\u000d\u000a      social groups with significant health care issues but who also exhibit a\u000d\u000a      low propensity to access NHS resources via general practitioners in the\u000d\u000a      first instance. Academic research on police custody environments is rare\u000d\u000a      at UK level and almost entirely absent in Scotland hence the studies\u000d\u000a      described in this document make a key contribution to knowledge about\u000d\u000a      custody issues.\u000d\u000a    At a time of severe resource pressures the opportunities for cost savings\u000d\u000a      that may &#8212; or may not &#8212; arise have been examined by the research and it\u000d\u000a      will help decision-makers to identify and quantify them against other\u000d\u000a      potential benefit criteria, such as enhanced human rights, personal\u000d\u000a      well-being or reduced rates of recidivism.\u000d\u000a    Impact on the rights of detained persons and the reputational standing of\u000d\u000a      Scottish police personnel and institutions is being affected through\u000d\u000a      informing the decision-making process.

Drawing on\u000d\u000a      research undertaken over the period 2010-2012, the two sessions involved\u000d\u000a      significant participation\u000d\u000a      by the political leadership of DLS, and focused on negotiating the\u000d\u000a      complexities of European\u000d\u000a      political alignments, the advantages of pan-European collaborations, and\u000d\u000a      the processes by which\u000d\u000a      new relationships could advance relevant political agendas.\u000d\u000a    The first, in January 2011, provoked such interest that Dunphy was\u000d\u000a      invited to organize a second in\u000d\u000a      May 2012 organised around debate on the article, `Seven Year Itch? The\u000d\u000a      European Left Party:\u000d\u000a      Struggling to transform the European Union'. Dunphy's brief was to explain\u000d\u000a      the nature of EL; to\u000d\u000a      outline the different forms and levels of membership and participation\u000d\u000a      available to parties and non-party organisations; and to clarify the\u000d\u000a      vision of the EU to which EL is committed.\u000d\u000a    DLS is not a political party, but a campaigning political network. Its\u000d\u000a      membership is open to\u000d\u000a      members of various political parties and none and it currently includes in\u000d\u000a      its ranks members of the\u000d\u000a      SNP, the Labour Party and the Greens. At times of European Parliament\u000d\u000a      elections, its members\u000d\u000a      can be found campaigning for rival political parties. For this reason,\u000d\u000a      full membership of a TNP is\u000d\u000a      not appropriate for DLS. Notwithstanding this, DLS was clearly interested\u000d\u000a      in pursuing contacts in\u000d\u000a      Europe so as to be better equipped to challenge Euroscepticism at home and\u000d\u000a      to overcome a sense\u000d\u000a      of national isolation. Hence the invitation to Dunphy to disseminate the\u000d\u000a      research.\u000d\u000a    EL was the first TNP to introduce the concept of individual membership,\u000d\u000a      allowing EU citizens to by-pass nationally-based parties and to\u000d\u000a      participate directly in EL activities. Until this innovation, all\u000d\u000a      TNPs had been federations of national parties, in essence. The concept of\u000d\u000a      direct individual\u000d\u000a      membership was seen as an important way of encouraging the emergence of a\u000d\u000a      European political\u000d\u000a      consciousness and ultimately a European civil society. Dunphy explained\u000d\u000a      that individual\u000d\u000a      membership has advanced considerably in some countries (for example,\u000d\u000a      Italy); but stagnated in\u000d\u000a      others (for example, France). The UK lies somewhere between these\u000d\u000a      extremes. Deep divisions\u000d\u000a      within EL have frustrated attempts to find a clear role for individual\u000d\u000a      members.\u000d\u000a    Key to the DLS National Council's decision-making regarding transnational\u000d\u000a      political party\u000d\u000a      participation was consideration of membership distinctions and association\u000d\u000a      status. Dunphy\u000d\u000a      explained the distinction between full and observer membership, and the\u000d\u000a      concept of external\u000d\u000a      association. Full membership is extended to parties that sign up to the EL\u000d\u000a      manifesto and statutes\u000d\u000a      and agree to fight European elections on the basis of a common and agreed\u000d\u000a      platform. Observer\u000d\u000a      membership is available to parties and non-party networks that are in\u000d\u000a      basic sympathy or\u000d\u000a      agreement with the project but do not commit themselves to a common\u000d\u000a      electoral platform. In\u000d\u000a      addition, EL has developed networks and `friendship circles' on common\u000d\u000a      themes that allow\u000d\u000a      `external association' on specific campaigns. For example, EL-Fem\u000d\u000a      (feminist issues), and EL-Trade Unions.\u000d\u000a    Dunphy's work was used to clarify how political organisations in Denmark\u000d\u000a      and elsewhere had\u000d\u000a      managed and negotiated such processes and issues. For example, he\u000d\u000a      explained how the Danish\u000d\u000a      Socialist People's Party, which sits with the Greens in the European\u000d\u000a      Parliament and is a member\u000d\u000a      of the Green TNP, nevertheless allows its trade unionist wing to\u000d\u000a      participate through external\u000d\u000a      association in EL-Trade Unions. Dunphy explained that full membership was\u000d\u000a      inappropriate for a\u000d\u000a      network like DLS; observer membership and external association were both\u000d\u000a      possibilities with\u000d\u000a      different levels of involvement; alternatively, DLS could urge its members\u000d\u000a      to apply for individual\u000d\u000a      membership of EL, but the research showed that this was ill-defined and\u000d\u000a      the subject of internal\u000d\u000a      battles within the TNP. If individual membership was considered as a\u000d\u000a      pathway, then the Greens\u000d\u000a      might offer a more congenial TNP than EL.\u000d\u000a    Dunphy also presented a full and detailed critique of EL's policies on\u000d\u000a      European integration, its\u000d\u000a      manifesto for the 2009 European elections, its attempts to use the\u000d\u000a      European Citizen's Initiative\u000d\u000a      (introduced by the Lisbon Treaty) to campaign for change and\u000d\u000a      transformation of the EU from\u000d\u000a      within, and its activities and alignment within in the European\u000d\u000a      Parliament.\u000d\u000a    As the corroborating letters [corroborating evidence 5.1 and 5.2]\u000d\u000a      indicate, the dissemination of the\u000d\u000a      research had a clear and direct impact on policy-making. As a direct\u000d\u000a      result of the workshop, the\u000d\u000a      DLS National Council took a decision to recommend to the September 2012\u000d\u000a      AGM that DLS\u000d\u000a      become an observer member of the European Left Party. A representative\u000d\u000a      attended a meeting of\u000d\u000a      EL's Council in Berlin in January 2013 where the application for\u000d\u000a      membership was approved.\u000d\u000a      Dunphy and March can thus state that the dissemination of their research\u000d\u000a      findings had a direct\u000d\u000a      bearing on a policy decision which has seen the transnational party, the\u000d\u000a      EL, receive its first ever\u000d\u000a      UK member-organisation.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    In January 2011 and May 2012, Richard Dunphy presented two workshops to\u000d\u000a      the National Council\u000d\u000a      of Democratic Left Scotland (DLS) based on research he had conducted in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Luke\u000d\u000a      March (University of Edinburgh).

Richard Dunphy (University of Dundee) and Luke March\u000d\u000a      (University of\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh) are involved in collaborative research on EL which has produced\u000d\u000a      several conference\u000d\u000a      papers, a published refereed journal article and a forthcoming book with\u000d\u000a      Manchester University\u000d\u000a      Press (2014). The underpinning research was carried out between January\u000d\u000a      2010 and January\u000d\u000a      2013, on an equal and shared basis. The research is the first ever\u000d\u000a      in-depth study of this TNP in the\u000d\u000a      English language.\u000d\u000a    Radical Left Parties (RLPs) have been relative laggards when it comes to\u000d\u000a      developing transnational\u000d\u000a      structures. In part, this reflects deep divisions on the left over\u000d\u000a      European integration. EL was\u000d\u000a      launched in 2004 by the RLPs which eschew extreme euroscepticism, and are\u000d\u000a      committed to\u000d\u000a      changing the direction of the EU away from neo-liberalism. Such parties\u000d\u000a      perceive the need for a\u000d\u000a      transnational party structure to embody this politics. From the outset,\u000d\u000a      both hard-line communist\u000d\u000a      parties that preach euroscepticism (for example, the Greek and Portuguese)\u000d\u000a      and left-nationalist\u000d\u000a      parties (for example, Sinn F&#233;in) have refused to engage with EL, whilst\u000d\u000a      Reform-communist parties\u000d\u000a      sympathetic to European integration in Spain and Italy and New Left\u000d\u000a      movements, principally Syriza\u000d\u000a      in Greece, have played the leading role in launching and developing EL.\u000d\u000a    The research which forms the basis of the impact study focused on the\u000d\u000a      first seven years of EL,\u000d\u000a      2004-2011. Our research confronts issues of direct concern to the\u000d\u000a      participants and helps develop\u000d\u000a      their own self-understanding. It assesses whether or not EL has developed\u000d\u000a      as an effective actor in\u000d\u000a      Europe and offers criteria to assess the success or failure of its\u000d\u000a      political strategy. The research is\u000d\u000a      underpinned by field research in Brussels; numerous, in-depth, structured\u000d\u000a      interviews with MEPs,\u000d\u000a      European Parliament officials, and officials from national parties and\u000d\u000a      TNPs; and, of course, primary\u000d\u000a      and secondary sources.

As she\u000a      told us, the current lack of women candidates is a serious restriction to\u000a      voter choice.\"\u000a      (http:\/\/debates.oireachtas.ie\/seanad\/2012\/02\/02\/00007.asp)\u000a    This statement in the Irish Seanad (upper house) was made by Senator\u000a      Ivana Bacik during the Second Stage debate on the Electoral (Amendment)\u000a      (Political Funding) Bill, which went on to pass all stages on 29 July 2012\u000a      and was subsequently signed into law by the Irish President.\u000a    The gender quota provisions of the Bill (section 5) were directly\u000a      influenced by Galligan's research [1,3], and, most immediately, her\u000a      evidence to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's\u000a      Rights' sub-Committee on Women's Participation in Politics, which laid the\u000a      foundations for the Bill.\u000a    The aim of the sub-committee was `to examine the challenges facing women\u000a      who wish to pursue a career in politics at local, national and European\u000a      levels'. Its report was published in October 2009 and draws heavily (12\u000a      citations) on the oral evidence that Professor Galligan provided to the\u000a      sub-committee on 9 September 2009 and direct references to her published\u000a      work [1, 2, 3]. Galligan's studies shaped the substantive conclusions in\u000a      the Joint Committee report (known as the Bacik Report) published\u000a      in 2009, most notably its recommendation that provisions be made for a 30%\u000a      candidate gender quota, rising to 40% thereafter. This recommendation was\u000a      fully adopted in Section 5 of the Bill.\u000a    Additional impacts of Galligan's research on gender equality can be seen\u000a      in how it has informed policy change in political parties and attitudes\u000a      among the public in Ireland, Northern Ireland, and internationally:\u000a    a) In May 2005 Galligan addressed the Irish Labour Party Commission on\u000a      Women's Participation in the Labour Party. The background notes for that\u000a      meeting draw on her 2004 version of the 2006 research referenced above\u000a      [evidence available for confidential review]. Galligan's submission drew\u000a      attention to the imposition of financial penalties on parties, and she\u000a      argued that this was a strategy that could provide an incentive to\u000a      political parties given the high levels of public funding supporting Irish\u000a      parties. This point was taken up by the Chairperson of Labour Women, who\u000a      chaired the Commission and was also legal advisor to the Irish Labour\u000a      Party. She brought this idea into her drafting of the Electoral\u000a        (Gender Parity) Private Members Bill 2009. The substance of this\u000a      Bill\"especially its provision for funding sanctions\"was incorporated into\u000a      the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011. The main\u000a      architect of the Private Members Bill evidences this impact,\u000a      noting the striking resemblance to the suggestions first presented by\u000a      Galligan in the final legislative output.\u000a    b) The impact of Galligan's research can also be seen by the fact that\u000a      she was commissioned to draft an equality plan for Fianna F&#225;il, published\u000a      as Independent Gender Equality Audit and Fianna Fail Gender Equality\u000a        Plan 2004-14 [4 above]. She was asked to conduct a mid-term review\u000a      of this plan in 2008-09 which subsequently formed the basis for the\u000a      current Fianna Fail Gender Equality Action Plan 2013-2018, launched in\u000a      July 2013. The Audit and Review drew consecutively on her expert knowledge\u000a      based on [1,2,3] above and her work for Fianna Fail significantly\u000a      influenced attitudes at elite level on the measures necessary to bring\u000a      more women into electoral politics. The Audit and Review are extensively\u000a      drawn upon in the 2013 Plan, particularly (but not only) in the section\u000a      `Implementation Status of the targets sets out in the Gender Equality\u000a      Action Plan 2004-14', pp. 27-29.\u000a    c) In February 2013, Professor Galligan presented an expert briefing to\u000a      the government-initiated `Convention on the Constitution' on the subject\u000a      of women's participation in politics\/public life. She drew on [1, 2, 3 and\u000a      4] in developing the presentation. The Convention is a deliberative forum\u000a      of 100 individuals tasked with making recommendations on constitutional\u000a      change to the government by end 2013. Any recommendations accepted by\u000a      government will be put to a referendum to amend the Constitution. Galligan\u000a      identified article 40 as requiring a more explicit recognition of equality\u000a      between women and men. The change was supported by 67% of the Convention.\u000a      Professor Galligan's briefing paper, drawing on [1,2,3 and 4] is posted\u000a      on:\u000a      https:\/\/www.constitution.ie\/Convention.aspx#documents\u000a    d) In December 2010, Galligan was invited to address the Annual\u000a      Conference of the Democratic Unionist Party on `bringing more women into\u000a      politics'. Her presentation, based on [1, 2 and 3] supported the internal\u000a      mobilisation of women DUP members, and at the 2011 Assembly elections the\u000a      party ran 7 women, securing the election of 5 women, the largest cohort of\u000a      female candidates and MLAs in its history.\u000a    e) In March 2013, Professor Galligan was invited to address the `Leaders\u000a      Leading Change' event in Belfast City Hall which discussed ways of\u000a      changing the face of politics in Northern Ireland. All parties had\u000a      representatives at this conference, at which an agenda for action was\u000a      formulated. Professor Galligan presented her research on gender quotas [3]\u000a      along with later relevant research. She was invited, arising from this\u000a      presentation, to prepare a briefing report for the Minister for the\u000a      Environment on the adoption of gender-friendly measures relating to the\u000a      working conditions of councillors in a reconfigured local government.\u000a    f) In July 2013, Galligan was invited by the Organisation for Security\u000a      and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), comprising 57 member states, to\u000a      contribute in a closed expert session to revision of the guidelines on\u000a      political party regulation. Her brief was to indicate how the gender\u000a      equality provisions in the Venice Commission guidelines on political party\u000a      regulation could be strengthened and mainstreamed. Her policy paper, based\u000a      on [3] and on additional research has been incorporated in revised Venice\u000a      Commission considerations.\u000a    g) Also in July 2013 Galligan was invited by Junior Minister and MLA,\u000a      Jennifer McCann, to make a presentation to Sinn F&#233;in women in Northern\u000a      Ireland on ways of increasing women's political representation in the\u000a      party. She drew on her quota research [3], and on her comparative research\u000a      on barriers to women's representation [1 and 2] to provide party women\u000a      with a rationale for mobilising for internal party change.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Sustained research by Professor Galligan on reforming political processes\u000a      to address women's political underrepresentation in Ireland has led to new\u000a      law and changed the attitudes of politicians, political parties and\u000a      government on this key democratic issue. Her research had a direct\u000a      influence on the Electoral (Amendment)( Political Funding) Bill (2011)\u000a      which provides for gender quotas for candidates at Irish general\u000a      elections. The research has also influenced the equal opportunities\u000a      practices of Irish political parties (including Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and\u000a      Labour), thereby effecting an attitudinal change among political elites.\u000a      Additionally, Galligan's research on political reform for gender equality\u000a      influenced the Irish Constitutional Convention's second report to\u000a      government.

At 15% in\u000a      2013, women's presence in the Irish parliament is among the lowest in the\u000a      EU and lower than both the House of Commons (22%) and the Northern Ireland\u000a      Assembly (19%). Professor Galligan has published widely on the democratic\u000a      problem of women's under-representation in Ireland for over two decades,\u000a      and has argued in research articles, public presentations and commissioned\u000a      reports for political parties in favour of gender quotas in political and\u000a      public settings as a means of addressing the persistent gender deficit in\u000a      public decision-making throughout that period. The crisis in economic and\u000a      political life in Ireland from 2008 onwards generated a lively public\u000a      debate on political reform, one aspect of which was the questioning of\u000a      public decision outcomes formulated by male-dominated decision-making\u000a      arenas (e.g. parliament, government, Central Bank). This public discourse\u000a      provided Galligan with opportunities to advance her analysis and\u000a      solutions, effectively setting the agenda for political reform on this\u000a      issue.\u000a    Two projects in particular underpin the research driving her impact, [1]\u000a      and [3] below. The research for [1] examined women representatives'\u000a      experience of political life and the attitudes of women political elites\u000a      in Ireland toward positive action initiatives that would assist in\u000a      increasing women's legislative presence. It examined how Irish women\u000a      politicians responded to various suggestions for positive action in three\u000a      arenas: combining legislative and family responsibilities, funding a\u000a      political campaign and getting elected. The research highlights the broad\u000a      consensus among women politicians, irrespective of party, self-interest,\u000a      or length of service, favouring certain positive action initiatives, as\u000a      well as their reluctance to support other options. It also illustrates the\u000a      complexity of implementing some of these reforms. In addition, the\u000a      research emphasized how cultural expectations and values act to inhibit\u000a      women's political agency. This research was conducted during 1999-2001,\u000a      when Galligan was appointed founding Director of the Centre for\u000a      Advancement of Women in Politics in Queen's University (2000). The\u000a      research output was the culmination of a study funded by the Irish\u000a      parliament. It was the first systematic research conducted on women\u000a      politicians' views on the measures needed to support women's political\u000a      ambitions and careers. As such, it broke new ground and provided a\u000a      reasoned, objective basis for discussions between party leaderships and\u000a      Galligan on reform measures they could implement to address women's\u000a      under-representation. At that point, parties were strongly resistant to\u000a      the adoption of gender quotas but open to implementing other measures to\u000a      encourage women's political representation.\u000a    In [3] Galligan critically evaluates the range of strategies used\u000a      internationally to increase women's political representation. This\u000a      research examines legislative quota provisions, pointing to their\u000a      multi-faceted interaction with the electoral and political systems in\u000a      which they are embedded. Different types of quotas are considered and\u000a      voluntary quotas are assessed as a method of supporting women's political\u000a      opportunities. Also examined is the role that organised women in civil\u000a      society play in promoting gender parity. Galligan identifies the optimal\u000a      conditions for increasing women's political presence: when political\u000a      women, feminists within governing institutions and civil society activists\u000a      coalesce to pursue this goal. This text was particularly useful in\u000a      providing clarity on the different types of quota measures to party\u000a      leaderships, politicians, women's sections in parties, and civil society\u000a      reform advocates. It informed the discussions of the parliamentary\u000a      committee investigating the under-representation of women in political\u000a      life (2009) and was subsequently cited in the committee's report. The\u000a      research was carried out in 2005-6, at a time when the issue of gender\u000a      quotas as an instrument for increasing women's political representation\u000a      was beginning to have traction within parties.\u000a    In [2], Galligan has written the standard text on women in Irish politics\u000a      that is consulted by policy-makers, journalists, researchers and others\u000a      seeking a definitive analysis of women's positions in Irish political\u000a      decision-making. It is referenced by parliamentary researchers and senior\u000a      civil servants in developing equality policies for the democratic\u000a      processes. It has been revised on a regular basis (every 2-3 years) since\u000a      its first publication in 1992 and thereby provides timely analysis of the\u000a      subject, as well as integrating new research findings on the topic. In\u000a      this document, Galligan provides the normative as well as empirical\u000a      arguments for the descriptive and substantive representation of women on\u000a      an equal basis with men. This research gained Galligan a place as Ireland\u000a      representative and Vice-Chairperson of a 6-person expert group of the\u000a      Council of Europe (CoE) in 2000, with the task of formulating a policy\u000a      text on gender equality in political decision-making for Member State\u000a      adoption. The Recommendation was agreed and signed by all CoE member\u000a      states (45 at the time), and became Recommendation 3 (2003) on the\u000a      balanced participation of women and men in political and public\u000a      decision-making.\u000a    For item [4] Galligan secured party access previously unavailable to\u000a      independent researchers and, with her research team, analysed the audit\u000a      results from the Fianna Fail study. Galligan was subsequently invited to\u000a      continue working with the party to develop the targeted `Action Plan',\u000a      adopted at the 2004 party conference, in which the Fianna Fail party\u000a      agreed to adopt Professor Galligan's recommendation on the introduction of\u000a      gender quotas for representation of party members at selection\u000a      conventions. This measure was implemented by the party leadership and\u000a      transformed the gender-balance of local decision-making arenas. The\u000a      research and gender equality plan became a strong point of differentiation\u000a      of Fianna Fail from its main rival, Fine Gael in advance of the 2011\u000a      general election as it sought to replace Fianna Fail as the major party in\u000a      Ireland.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38400","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The case-study reflects one aspect of the significance of Wilford's\u000d\u000a      extended research programme (see reference 1 in Section 3) on NI\u000d\u000a      devolution throughout the REF cycle, most recently in relation to reform\u000d\u000a      of the Assembly and the Executive which is the explicit focus of this\u000d\u000a      case-study.\u000d\u000a    Re (i) in Section 2: In relation to the Assembly, Wilford proposed: the\u000d\u000a      decoupling of Assembly constituencies from Westminster constituencies, as\u000d\u000a      in Scotland and Wales; a reduction in its membership to, preferably, 80\u000d\u000a      MLAs (from 108 members); a full-scale review of the Assembly's Committees,\u000d\u000a      including their number, size, the avoidance of both multiple committee\u000d\u000a      memberships and high rates of membership turnover, and their modus\u000d\u000a        operandi; and the designation of a number of `Committee days' in the\u000d\u000a      chamber.

(The input on this aspect of the review is\u000d\u000a      acknowledged in the Assembly Research Paper, NIAR 592-12, 4 September\u000d\u000a      2012, p. 26).\u000d\u000a    The Executive-related aspects of the AERC's inquiry were included in a\u000d\u000a      second report (NIA 34\/11-15, 20 November 2012) that identified `areas of\u000d\u000a      commonality' among the parties. These included agreement in principle on\u000d\u000a      the restructuring and reduction in the number of Executive Departments,\u000d\u000a      including the creation of a single Department of the Economy\"which Wilford\u000d\u000a      had proposed\"and the need to reform OFMDFM, one of his key\u000d\u000a      recommendations. The Committee also agreed with Wilford's recommendation\u000d\u000a      to adopt a holistic approach to Executive redesign, rather than a\u000d\u000a      piecemeal\/incremental one.\u000d\u000a    In early 2013, the Committee began the second-leg of its review,\u000d\u000a      addressing the use of d'Hondt, community designation and the enabling of\u000d\u000a      an Official Opposition in the Assembly. Wilford furnished both written and\u000d\u000a      oral research-based evidence to the Committee in January and February\u000d\u000a      2013. The full impact of Wilford's research-based evidence to this phase\u000d\u000a      of the review is yet to be determined: for instance, the referral to the\u000d\u000a      Liaison Group (comprising Committee Chairs) of Wilford's recommendation\u000d\u000a      that an holistic review of Assembly committees be undertaken is underway\u000d\u000a      and the report is scheduled to appear in late 2013.

Interviews\u000d\u000a      conducted by Wilford with MLAs, including Committee Chairs, had also\u000d\u000a      underscored their desire for behavioural change among members: i.e. their\u000d\u000a      need to internalise more fully their roles as parliamentarians. The\u000d\u000a      research argues that the initial design of the institutions, especially\u000d\u000a      that of the Assembly, enhances the strength of party discipline, not least\u000d\u000a      within and among Committees, whereas structural and behavioural\u000d\u000a      reform would enable MLAs to act as more fully-developed parliamentarians.\u000d\u000a    The absence of provision for an Official Opposition in the Assembly\u000d\u000a      underscores the need for both individual Assembly Members, and Statutory\u000d\u000a      Committees, to assert their independent-mindedness vis-&#224;-vis the\u000d\u000a      Executive. Engineering such behavioural change is inextricably linked to\u000d\u000a      the need for structural reform of both the Assembly and the Executive in\u000d\u000a      ways designed to loosen the constraints created by the 1998 model of\u000d\u000a      consociationalism (see references 3, 4 and 5 in Section 3).\u000d\u000a    Re (ii): The research also addressed the constraints associated with both\u000d\u000a      the design and practice of the Executive, not least the absence of\u000d\u000a      joined-up government which hampers the formulation and delivery of public\u000d\u000a      policy. It identified both structural and behavioural obstacles to\u000d\u000a      effective government and argued for the holistic redesign of the\u000d\u000a      Executive, including the reduction in the total number of Departments, and\u000d\u000a      the identification of a more strategic role for the Office of First\u000d\u000a      Minister and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM).\u000d\u000a    In sum the research led to the evidence-based view that Assembly and\u000d\u000a      Executive reform should be guided by a more flexible understanding of\u000d\u000a      consociationalism than that embedded in the 1998 Belfast Agreement. The\u000d\u000a      implementation of the latter has produced a set of structures and\u000d\u000a      behaviours that constrain the effectiveness and efficiency of the devolved\u000d\u000a      institutions, both internally and in terms of their interaction. Wilford's\u000d\u000a      research identifies reforms that are designed to improve institutional\u000d\u000a      (and individual) performance in ways that are consistent with a more\u000d\u000a      liberal form of consociational practice.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38864","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact occurring in the period 2008 - 2013, draws upon earlier\u000d\u000a      activities undertaken by Toke in late 2007. Based upon the research listed\u000d\u000a      above, Toke was invited to produce a report for the NGO `The World Future\u000d\u000a      Council' on the possibilities for renewable energy feed-in tariffs in the\u000d\u000a      UK, called `Making Renewable FITTER' [see source 1 below]. The World\u000d\u000a      Future Council is an environmentally-oriented NGO funded mainly by German\u000d\u000a      based charitable benefactors interested in building support for feed-in\u000d\u000a      tariffs. This is a system that is widely perceived as being effective in\u000d\u000a      promoting renewable energy in Germany and was hoped would have a similar\u000d\u000a      effect in the UK if implemented. The main recommendation of Toke's report\u000d\u000a      for the World Future Council was the establishment of feed-in tariffs for\u000d\u000a      small renewable energy projects. This report was submitted to the UK\u000d\u000a      Government's review of renewable energy funding in September 2007. During\u000d\u000a      this period, Toke discussed the report with a range of NGOs, journalists,\u000d\u000a      government officials, regulatory officials, and also a junior Treasury\u000d\u000a      Minister.\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, Toke's research and in particular, the report on renewable\u000d\u000a      energy and wider activities supporting the work of NGOs, has contributed\u000a        to changes in government policy. The report proved to be an\u000d\u000a      important factor in a process leading to the passage of a significant\u000d\u000a      piece of legislation, the Energy Act 2008, establishing a system of\u000d\u000a      feed-in tariffs for small renewable energy projects. This Act which was in\u000d\u000a      line with the recommendations made in Toke's 2007 report [source 2]. It is\u000d\u000a      notable that the Act was adopted in the context of a successful lobbying\u000d\u000a      campaign focussed partly on persuading backbench MP's to put pressure on\u000d\u000a      the Government to introduce feed-in tariff legislation. Toke's work\u000d\u000a      contributed to the initial spur for the campaign organised by NGOs\u000d\u000a      including Friends of the Earth, the World Future Council, Solar Century\u000d\u000a      and the Renewable Energy Association. The campaign was led at a backbench\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary level by Alan Simpson MP. Toke has been a leading member of\u000d\u000a      the campaign for a feed-in tariff approach since 2006 [source 3]. In this\u000d\u000a      way Toke's research can also be seen as influencing the work of NGOs,\u000d\u000a        and indirectly, the work of UK MPs.\u000d\u000a    The feed-in tariff system came into effect in 2010 and was immediately\u000d\u000a      successful. Not only did it increase financial support for the providers\u000d\u000a      of renewable energy systems, but through incentivising the installation of\u000d\u000a      renewable energy sources, the system made a notable contribution to\u000d\u000a      environmental sustainability (a total installed capacity of 1.657MW has\u000d\u000a      been registered under Feed-in Tariffs to December 2012 [source 4, p1]).\u000d\u000a    Since 2010 Toke has continued to be active in supporting the feed-in\u000d\u000a      tariff agenda, particularly through his work with environmental NGOs. Most\u000d\u000a      recently, Toke's research and advice hasinformed the development of\u000d\u000a        further work on energy issues and campaigning by Friends of the Earth\u000d\u000a      (2011-2013 in particular). In December 2012 Friends of the Earth published\u000d\u000a      a report by Toke entitled `'A Proven Solution &#8212; How to Grow Renewables\u000d\u000a      with a Fixed Feed-in Tariff' [source 5]. In June 2012, he submitted\u000d\u000a      written evidence to the Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change\u000d\u000a      during its scrutiny of the Energy Bill [source 6], and through this, his\u000d\u000a      `green energy blog' (http:\/\/realfeed-intariffs.blogspot.co.uk\/),\u000a      letters and other activities has made a significant contribution to the\u000d\u000a      argument in favour of giving incentives for renewable energy. He has also\u000d\u000a      been in the forefront of campaigns to ensure that nuclear power does not\u000d\u000a      receive preferential treatment to renewable power through articles and\u000d\u000a      letters in local and international news outlets [source 7].\u000d\u000a    Toke has publically challenged the UK government's `Electricity\u000d\u000a      Market Reform'. Through articles and letters to the Guardian, the\u000d\u000a      Sunday Times and other media on the subject of renewable energy\u000d\u000a      funding and the Government's Electricity Market reforms, Toke has used his\u000d\u000a      research findings of this research to demonstrate that the Government has\u000d\u000a      done too little to set up effective support mechanisms for renewable\u000d\u000a      energy. However thanks to public pressure, the Energy Bill has been\u000d\u000a      amended to include a mechanism that could support a recognisable renewable\u000d\u000a      energy programme. Toke's work has been instrumental in shaping opinion\u000d\u000a      that has led to reform. Indeed, Toke has sought not only to effect change\u000d\u000a      in policy, but to change public awareness with regard to the\u000d\u000a      detrimental effects of existing government policy on the environment and\u000d\u000a      the renewable energy industry.\u000d\u000a    Toke's research is now beginning to influence policy beyond England\u000d\u000a        and Wales. In 2011 he became a member of an expert group established\u000d\u000a      to advise the Green Group of MEPs in the European Parliament on the\u000d\u000a      subject of renewable energy policy. His contribution was mostly in the\u000d\u000a      areas of financial support mechanisms for renewable energy and nuclear\u000d\u000a      power funding. Other members were drawn from public policy think tanks,\u000d\u000a      green NGOs, renewable trade associations, expert consultancies and\u000d\u000a      academia. The report, which will influence the direction of EU policy, was\u000d\u000a      published by the Heinrich Boll Foundation and lists Toke as one of the\u000d\u000a      contributing experts [source 8]. Toke was also invited to advise the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government's Energy related civil servants in June 2012, when he\u000d\u000a      led a seminar on the EMR proposals and the impact on the Scottish\u000d\u000a      independence debate. This input demonstrates that the financial viability\u000d\u000a      of renewable energy is a growing concern and that Toke's research\u000d\u000a      continues to be in demand by policy-making bodies. Furthermore, his\u000d\u000a      research has also received significant press coverage after the\u000d\u000a      publication of the final report (including Herald Scotland and The\u000a        Guardian), and thus contributed to the public debate and\u000d\u000a      understanding.\u000d\u000a    Toke's research has also stimulated and facilitated debate among\u000d\u000a      industry professionals, NGOs and government. In January 2013, Toke issued\u000d\u000a      a Birmingham Brief &#8212; an expert comment piece, which aims to provide\u000d\u000a      concise, relevant and timely expert comment for policy makers and the\u000d\u000a      media. Toke also hosted an open debate the same month, involving\u000d\u000a      representatives from both the energy and policy sectors. Key speakers\u000d\u000a      included Rachel Cary (Senior Policy Advisor, Green Alliance); Gaynor\u000d\u000a      Hartnell (Chief Executive of the Renewable Energy Association); Doug Parr\u000d\u000a      (Chief Scientist, Greenpeace UK); Dave Timms (Energy and Climate\u000d\u000a      Campaigner, Friends of the Earth); and Alan Whitehead MP (Chair of the\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary Renewable and Sustainable Energy Group). The conference\u000d\u000a      explored the policies needed to underpin a feed-in tariff system for\u000d\u000a      funding renewable energy, and also the sort of policy environment that is\u000d\u000a      needed to ensure the maximum expansion of renewable energy [source 9]. The\u000d\u000a      event coincided with the passage through Parliament of the Energy Bill\u000d\u000a      implementing Electricity Market Reform (EMR) which concerned giving\u000d\u000a      priority to a low-carbon electricity strategy. Following the conference in\u000d\u000a      January 2013, Tom Greatrex MP, the Shadow Energy Minister, personally\u000d\u000a      requested Toke's views. Toke's reports have also been requested by\u000d\u000a      Alistair Darling MP (former Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of\u000d\u000a      State for Scotland) and Lord Foulkes of Comnuck.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr David Toke's research at the University of Birmingham has contributed\u000a        to policy made by governments in the UK and EU, and the work and\u000d\u000a        policy of environmentally concerned NGOs.

Toke's research identified how so-called `market\u000d\u000a      based' systems used to promote renewable energy in countries like the UK\u000d\u000a      were less cost effective compared with systems where prices paid to\u000d\u000a      renewable generators are set by the state. These systems which involve\u000d\u000a      more government intervention in price setting are called `feed-in\u000d\u000a      tariffs', the best known of which operates in Germany. A particular\u000d\u000a      problem is that market based systems lack the certainty about future\u000d\u000a      returns in order to secure cost-effective investment in specific types of\u000d\u000a      required renewable energy generation capacity. The market-based systems\u000d\u000a      are also unsuitable for independent renewable developers compared to\u000d\u000a      utility based projects, while feed-in tariffs have a good record in\u000d\u000a      promoting volume growth in renewable energy.\u000d\u000a    Toke also provided insight into the politics behind different policy\u000d\u000a      outcomes on renewable energy support systems in different countries and at\u000d\u000a      a pan-EU level. This included analysis of different approaches based on\u000d\u000a      liberal economic theories and political economy. His research on the\u000d\u000a      politics of the 2009 EU Directive on Renewable Energy showed what degree\u000d\u000a      of harmonisation should be achieved between renewable energy support\u000d\u000a      systems, and also whether `market based' or `feed-in tariff' models were\u000d\u000a      most appropriate for renewable energy support mechanisms in EU member\u000d\u000a      states.\u000d\u000a    Toke's research into renewable energy and the financing of renewable\u000d\u000a      energy began in the 1990s, but the impact reported below arises from two\u000d\u000a      projects (full details below): First an ESRC funded project into\u000d\u000a      `Accounting for the Outcomes of Wind farm Planning Applications' from\u000d\u000a      2003-2005 which in its latter stages focused also, by agreement with the\u000d\u000a      ESRC, on the financing of renewable energy. Second, an FP6 (EU funded\u000d\u000a      project) programme, which ran from 2005-2007, on integration of\u000d\u000a      fluctuating renewable energy into the grid and which explored a number of\u000d\u000a      financial issues; this activity was particularly important in focussing\u000d\u000a      attention on issues relating to feed-in tariffs.\u000d\u000a    Toke was also co-investigator on the ESRC funded project: \"Delivering\u000d\u000a      renewable energy under devolution\", January 2011 - December 2012. The\u000d\u000a      project was led by the University of Cardiff with fellow collaborators\u000d\u000a      including Queens University Belfast and Robert Gordon University. It\u000d\u000a      assessed the impacts of devolution on the provision of renewable energy\u000d\u000a      focusing on the cases of the UK government in Westminster as the English\u000d\u000a      national level (Toke led the work stream for this area), and the devolved\u000d\u000a      governments established in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland since\u000d\u000a      1999. The research combined qualitative data, gathered from documentary\u000d\u000a      sources and interviews with government, business and pressure groups, with\u000d\u000a      quantitative data derived from data-bases of renewable energy development.\u000d\u000a      The findings contributed to ongoing societal debates about the UK\u000d\u000a      constitutional settlement and progress towards the 2020 EU Renewable\u000d\u000a      Energy targets.\u000d\u000a    Toke undertook this research whilst being employed as a full time\u000d\u000a      academic at the University of Birmingham, in the School of Government and\u000d\u000a      Society and the Department of Sociology. Toke was a Research Fellow from\u000d\u000a      2001 to 2005, and from 2005 was first a Lecturer, and from 2006 - 2013, a\u000d\u000a      Senior Lecturer in Environmental Policy.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38866","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2562770","Name":"Malta"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pace's impact can be evidenced in three ways: (i) informing EU policy\u000a      decisions; (ii) influencing the EU's policy agenda; (iii) contributing to\u000a      public debate.\u000a    Informing EU policy\u000a    Pace was invited by IDEA in Stockholm to share research findings and\u000a      insights from her British Academy and ESRC funded research grants in 2008.\u000a      This gave rise to two commissioned papers (source 1 below) and involvement\u000a      in a series of meetings between 2008 and 2010 under the heading of Global\u000a      Consultations on the EU's Role in Democracy Building. The Senior Advisor\u000a      to the project is clear that Pace's research input was influential &#8212; she\u000a      states that it provided the project `with deeper insights and additional\u000a      legitimacy &#8212; and made a very important contribution to the credibility\u000a        of [the] project report' (source 2). Under the auspices of the\u000a      Swedish Presidency of the EU, the report that emerged from the IDEA\u000a      initiative was subsequently `used to inform EU member states and\u000a        institutional deliberations, and with its substance inspired the\u000a        EU Council conclusions adopted' (source 2): the EP's Resolution of\u000a      22 October 2009 on Democracy Building in the EU's External Relations (www.europarl.europa.eu\/sides\/getDoc.do?pubRef=-\u000a        \/\/EP\/\/TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2009-0056+0+DOC+XML+V0\/\/EN) and the 17 November\u000a      2009 European Council Conclusions on Democracy Support in the EU's\u000a      External Relations\u000a      (www.consilium.europa.eu\/uedocs\/cms_data\/docs\/pressdata\/en\/gena\/111250.pdf).\u000a    Influencing the agenda of the EU\u000a    Pace's research has challenged conventional wisdom about the type of\u000a      political reform that the EU has been promoting in the MENA region. Her\u000a      research has stimulated policy debate and has improved EU policy\u000a        makers' understanding of some of the deeper social issues within\u000a      MENA societies. Pace has engaged with policy makers in a number of ways.\u000a      In February 2012, she co-organised a Public Hearing under the auspices of\u000a      the European Parliament's (EP's) Committee on Foreign Affairs, held at the\u000a      EP building in Brussels (source 3). This followed an earlier invitation by\u000a      the EP for Pace to present critical feedback on the Review of the European\u000a      Neighbourhood Policy to Commissioner for Enlargement and Neighbourhood\u000a      Policy (&#352;tefan F&#252;le) at a Public Round Table on Making Democracy Promotion\u000a      Work in June 2011 (source 4). One MEP involved in both events noted that\u000a      Pace's 'research produces factual solutions and approaches that can and\u000a      have influenced and guided real life policy making in the European\u000a        Parliament and beyond' (source 5 &#8212; see also sources 6 and 7, which\u000a      confirm the position that Pace's research has been translated into\u000a      `tangible, effective policy' and has influenced individuals' `inputs into\u000a      the EU's policy making process').\u000a    Pace's research also led the EP to select her as an expert to deliver a\u000a      commissioned briefing on the Social, Economic, Political and Geo-Strategic\u000a      Situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories in October 2011 at the\u000a      EP in Strasbourg. Further, Pace was commissioned to write a paper on `The\u000a      End of EU Democracy Promotion and of the Two-State Solution?' for the\u000a      extended research arm of the Council of the EU, the EU Institute for\u000a      Security Studies (EUISS) in Paris (source 8). The EUISS Chaillot\u000a        Papers Series in which her contribution was published was mentioned\u000a      in the Jerusalem Post and Le Monde and cited by Biladi\u000a      and Publico in February and April 2011 (source 8).\u000a    Contributing to public debate\u000a    Following Pace's published research work, and her appearance at the EP,\u000a      she was contacted by a number of funding bodies in the UK and\u000a      international media representatives for her views on political\u000a      transformation processes in the MENA region. This latter contact has had\u000a      an impact on the way in which journalists report on democratization in the\u000a      MENA. The following are examples of these sorts of activity:\u000a    - In 2009, the British Academy Review commissioned Pace to write\u000a      a piece on `Democracy in Palestine and the Middle East Peace Process'\u000a      aimed at a non-specialist readership.\u000a    - In December 2009, Pace was interviewed by Danish National Radio\u000a      during an International Conference held at the Centre for Contemporary\u000a      Middle East Studies, University of Southern Denmark, Odense (at: http:\/\/www.dr.dk\/P1\/orientering\/indslag\/2009\/12\/03\/183739.htm).\u000a    - That same year, Pace's research acquired affiliation status with the\u000a      Council for British Research in the Levant in Jerusalem and was included\u000a      in the ESRC's Catalogue of Projects with Research Impact.\u000a    - In February 2011, she was interviewed by the Times of Malta on\u000a      the political unrest in the MENA (at: http:\/\/www.timesofmalta.com\/articles\/view\/20110203\/local\/eu-has-lost-all-credibility-on-democracy-in-middle-east.348320).\u000a    - In May 2011, Pace was interviewed by the Brazilian newspaper A\u000a        CR&#205;TICA.\u000a    - In June 2011, after Pace's contribution to the EP's Round Table on the\u000a      Review of the European Neighbourhood Policy, she was interviewed by the EUobserver\u000a      (at: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zFGeEJAD7RY).\u000a    - In June 2011, she was interviewed by the BBC Arabic Service following\u000a      her contribution to a workshop at Westminster University on `Islamism and\u000a      the Arab Revolutions: The Promise and the Pitfalls.'\u000a    - In June 2011, Pace was interviewed by Arild Foss on the `Arab Spring'\u000a      for the ESRC magazine, Society Now (at: http:\/\/www.esrc.ac.uk\/_images\/Society%20Now%20issue%2010_tcm8-16400.pdf).\u000a    - Demonstrating continuing contribution to the public debate with an\u000a      article in The Conversation in July 2013 (http:\/\/theconversation.com\/morsis-authority-ebbed-away-but-egypt-is-dangerously-divided-15774)\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A key priority of the EU since the 1990s has been the promotion of\u000a      liberal democracy in undemocratic and illiberal societies such as those of\u000a      the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

That year, she was awarded a Research Councils\u000a      United Kingdom (RCUK) Birmingham Research Fellowship on EU Enlargement\u000a      attached to the European Research Institute at the University of\u000a      Birmingham. She has also been the PI on two separate British Academy and\u000a      ESRC funded projects on democratisation in the MENA region (see below for\u000a      details).\u000a    These awards funded fieldwork in Egypt and Palestine, and allowed access\u000a      to key members of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. Interviews with these\u000a      figures (as well as a series of public events in both countries) shed new\u000a      light on how Islamists have been thinking about political transformation\u000a      in their societies; that, in turn, has allowed inferences to be drawn on\u000a      the efficacy of EU democracy-promotion efforts.\u000a    The key finding has been that the EU has misread the internal dynamics of\u000a      regime transformation and so its democracy promotion efforts have been\u000a      misdirected. Historically, the EU has worked with existing, often\u000a      authoritarian, regimes in the MENA in the hope that these regimes would\u000a      succumb to socialisation pressures leading to economic, social and\u000a      political reforms. For their part, those same regimes have responded to\u000a      the EU by introducing incremental and often cosmetic reforms (see output\u000a      R5 below).\u000a    What was not fully appreciated in EU policy was that even small moves\u000a      toward the liberalisation of entrenched authoritarianism would lead to\u000a      heightened expectations and the galvanising of popular movements for\u000a      reform. By banking on regime-led change, the EU was consequently\u000a      ill-prepared for the sudden political transitions occasioned by the Arab\u000a      Spring &#8212; that is, the revolutionary wave of demonstrations and protests\u000a      against authoritarian rule that have occurred across the MENA region since\u000a      December 2010 (R2, R4, R6).\u000a    Pace's research made clear that Arab exceptionalism &#8212; a predisposition\u000a      against democratisation &#8212; should not be assumed a priori. While the Arab\u000a      Spring has suffered reversal since 2012, it is nonetheless clear that\u000a      large sections of the population in the MENA region hold a deep-seated\u000a      belief in government accountability and political and civil rights (R1).\u000a      Further, Pace's research also served to highlight the fear harboured by\u000a      the EU in regard to Islamist actors' involvement in the political process\u000a      &#8212; namely that substantive political reform would empower anti-Western\u000a      extremists (R3).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38867","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Marquette's public engagement activities are core to her research and\u000d\u000a      provide the contacts and access for impact upon practitioners and\u000d\u000a      organisations. Such access has enabled Marquette to contribute to\u000d\u000a        policy debates and influence the development of policy in donor\u000d\u000a      agencies. Marquette has also been the Director of the GSDRC (Governance\u000d\u000a      &amp; Social Development Resource Centre) at the University of Birmingham\u000d\u000a      since 2010. The GSDRC, provides rapid research and knowledge management\u000d\u000a      services on governance, social development, conflict and humanitarian\u000d\u000a      issues to clients such as DFID, AusAID, the European Commission, the OECD\u000d\u000a      among others. It is a unique centre that has direct impact on\u000d\u000a      policy-making [see source 1 below].\u000d\u000a    Shaping the approach to International Anti-Corruption Programming:\u000d\u000a      Marquette has been asked to advise donor agencies on corruption and\u000d\u000a      governance reform. This includes evidence provided to the US Congress on\u000d\u000a      the World Bank's anti-corruption programme (June 2009); an invitation only\u000d\u000a      consultation on the World Bank's new Public Sector Strategy, held at DFID\u000d\u000a      in London (2011); and consultation on the World Bank's updated Governance\u000d\u000a      and Corruption Strategy (2012). In addition, Marquette is often invited to\u000d\u000a      participate in closed workshops on donors\/aid policy,\u000d\u000a      governance\/corruption and state-building, including: Overseas Development\u000d\u000a      Institute (ODI) event on `Transparency and Accountability in Fragile\u000d\u000a      States', where Marquette was a discussant (April 2011); invited speaker at\u000d\u000a      an OLAF (the EU's Anti-Fraud Agency) sponsored event on `Protecting Aid\u000d\u000a      Funds in Unstable Governance Environments' in Lisbon (May 2010); guest\u000d\u000a      speaker on FCO\/Chevening course on `Democracy, Rule of Law and Security'\u000d\u000a      (2009 and 2010).\u000d\u000a    The European Commission's Concept Note on Helping Partner Countries in\u000d\u000a      Fighting Corruption (2010-2011) includes direct reference to Marquette's\u000d\u000a      research on attitudes towards corruption [R3], included as a result of a\u000d\u000a      request from EuropeAid's then head of anti-corruption. This Concept Note\u000d\u000a      has been shared widely with EC staff, including EuropeAid, OLAF, Justice\u000d\u000a      and beyond. It has also been shared with EC partners, and has been\u000d\u000a      described as `a very useful guide, well-written and detailed' by a Senior\u000d\u000a      World Bank staff member [source 2]. As a result of this work, Marquette\u000d\u000a      has been asked on four separate occasions to develop and help deliver a\u000d\u000a      standard training package on corruption and anti-corruption for EuropeAid\u000d\u000a      and its partners (other EC bodies, development agencies and partner\u000d\u000a      governments).\u000d\u000a    Work in the Concept Note on measuring corruption has led to two further\u000d\u000a      areas of impact: Since 2011 Marquette has been a member of the\u000d\u000a      International Advisory Board for the Transparency International GATEway\u000d\u000a      project, which provides information and guidance on qualitative and\u000d\u000a      quantitative methodologies for measuring corruption. She was also\u000d\u000a      commissioned to lead a team in producing an Issues Paper on corruption\u000d\u000a      indicators used by donors in budget support; this paper has been included\u000d\u000a      on the World Bank's intranet site (GAC Portal).\u000d\u000a    Due to her research on corruption and anti-corruption programming, in\u000d\u000a      July 2012 Marquette was invited by Dr Mark Robinson, DFID's Deputy\u000d\u000a      Director of Research, to discuss the strength of research evidence in this\u000d\u000a      area. This led to Marquette being commissioned by a participant in the\u000d\u000a      workshop from the OECD, head also of the OECD's International\u000d\u000a      Anti-Corruption Task Team, to develop a high-level communications tool on\u000d\u000a      donor approaches to corruption\/anti-corruption, aimed at political leaders\u000d\u000a      and heads of donor agencies. As a result, Marquette's research is `feeding\u000a        directly into the development of policy at OECD and is helping\u000d\u000a        to shape [their] thinking in this area' [source 3].\u000d\u000a    Enabling the focus on agencies thinking and working `politically':\u000d\u000a      Research outputs R1 and R2 (below) called for aid agencies, and the World\u000d\u000a      Bank in particular, to frame corruption explicitly as a political issue.\u000d\u000a      Prior to 2008, Marquette's research had been cited in a UNODC paper &#8212; one\u000d\u000a      of the key inputs into debates around the creation of the UN Convention\u000d\u000a      Against Corruption (2002) and a Canadian International Development Agency\u000d\u000a      list of `recommended reading' (2004); and in 2009, a Norwegian Agency for\u000d\u000a      Development Cooperation review of anti-corruption literature [source 4].\u000d\u000a    Marquette's research led to an invitation by the Royal Netherlands\u000d\u000a      Embassy in Nairobi to be Team Leader on a Strategic Governance and\u000d\u000a      Anti-Corruption Analysis (SGACA) following the post-election violence in\u000d\u000a      Kenya (Sept-Nov 2008). This role entailed chairing the stakeholder\u000d\u000a      workshops that considered evidence of post-election violence. Findings\u000d\u000a      from the confidential report (in line with findings from Marquette's other\u000d\u000a      research) fed into the Kofi Annan Peace Process, both directly (in that\u000d\u000a      the final report was shared with the Team) and indirectly (in that members\u000d\u000a      of the workshops were Team members). It advised that a) ethnicity should\u000d\u000a      not be the international community's main focus, but rather the focus\u000d\u000a      should be on inequality (often but not only articulated on ethnic lines);\u000d\u000a      b) the Kenyan government has a long history of initiating commissions of\u000d\u000a      enquiry in response to international pressure, but these commissions have\u000d\u000a      almost without exception not led to action, and so the peace process\u000d\u000a      needed to ensure that recourse to the International Criminal Court\u000d\u000a      remained an option for the perpetrators of violence. Workshops linked to\u000d\u000a      the SGACA involved several donor agencies and governments, leading Kenyan\u000d\u000a      civil society activists, staff from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the\u000d\u000a      Hague and the Netherlands Ambassador to Kenya. The then first secretary at\u000d\u000a      the Embassy describes Marquette's research and approach as having provided\u000a        `the framework and content' for the policy and having `had distinct\u000d\u000a        impact on the work of [the] embassy in Kenya [source 5].\u000d\u000a    Marquette provided training on `political economy analysis (PEA)' to the\u000d\u000a      European Commission in 2010, and she was interviewed for the EC's\u000d\u000a      Community of Practice on PEA, made available on the Capacity4Dev platform\u000d\u000a      [source 6]. Marquette was also invited to present at the OECD-Development\u000d\u000a      Assistance Committee's Network on Governance (Govnet)'s annual meeting, in\u000d\u000a      April 2013, with follow-up presentations requested by UK's DFID, the\u000d\u000a      Norwegian aid agency (Norad) and the World Bank Institute.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Heather Marquette's research has influenced aid agencies by encouraging\u000d\u000a      them to recognise corruption as a primarily political issue as opposed to\u000d\u000a      an economic or managerial matter. This shift in understanding has contributed\u000d\u000a        to a change in perception among professionals on anti-corruption and to\u000d\u000a        alterations in programmes and practices among a number of organisations\u000d\u000a      including EuropeAid, AusAid and the World Bank Institute.\u000d\u000a    Marquette has directly contributed to policy thinking by providing expert\u000d\u000a      technical support to the anti-corruption programmes of a range of\u000d\u000a      international aid agencies and non-governmental organisations. As well as\u000d\u000a      direct guidance, her commissioned advisory activity has included the\u000d\u000a      provision of high-level training for donors and their partners, focussing\u000d\u000a      on the politics of corruption, anti-corruption programming and the role of\u000d\u000a      popular attitudes in supporting or undermining governance reform.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Birmingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Birmingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10006840}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2267057","Name":"Lisbon"},{"GeoNamesId":"184745","Name":"Nairobi"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Research Outputs:\u000d\u000a    \u000aR1) Marquette, H.

Marquette's research has two main strands:\u000d\u000a      (a) the role of aid agencies in governance\/state-building, and identifying\u000d\u000a      specifically how good governance and anti-corruption agendas are linked to\u000d\u000a      the politicisation of aid; and (b) explaining how attitudes towards\u000d\u000a      corruption in developing countries are formed and how this may impact on\u000d\u000a      the success or failure of anti-corruption reforms. The result has been a\u000d\u000a      substantial body of academic and policy publications about corruption and\u000d\u000a      aid since the early 2000s.\u000d\u000a    Research underpinning the claimed impact relates to the ways in which\u000d\u000a      domestic level politics in developing countries condition the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of donor-funded anti-corruption programmes, and the ways in\u000d\u000a      which domestic level politics are shaped by individual attitudes towards\u000d\u000a      corruption. The research concludes that corruption should be seen as a\u000d\u000a      collective action problem, rather than in terms of the\u000d\u000a      principal-agent\/rational choice theory that conventionally informs the\u000d\u000a      design of anti-corruption programmes. The broad, systematic and\u000d\u000a      comparative study of attitudes towards corruption in India and Nigeria\u000d\u000a      commenced in 2007 and utilises primary data generated by original,\u000d\u000a      in-depth qualitative fieldwork. It shows that citizen attitudes, rather\u000d\u000a      than the somewhat amorphous `culture' referred to in the literature, are\u000d\u000a      the key to understanding the effectiveness of anti-corruption programmes.\u000d\u000a      Because corruption should be seen as a collective action problem, it\u000d\u000a      should not be assumed that `the public' will be behind traditional\u000d\u000a      governance reforms. Understanding citizen attitudes, and helping to shape\u000d\u000a      those attitudes, is an essential factor in improving the outcomes of\u000d\u000a      anti-corruption programming. Current methodologies used to measure citizen\u000d\u000a      attitudes (often large-n cross-national surveys) have serious limitations,\u000d\u000a      because they often fail to capture this collective action dimension [R5].\u000d\u000a      As a result of such insights, Marquette has been commissioned by aid\u000d\u000a      agencies to conduct further research, including leading a team drafting\u000d\u000a      the European Commission's Concept Note on Helping Partner Countries in\u000d\u000a      Fighting Corruption (2010-2011) [R3].\u000d\u000a    Marquette's engagement with policy-makers on research is ongoing, and new\u000d\u000a      research on corruption and collective action, as well as the political\u000d\u000a      economy of aid, has recently been commissioned by AusAid (the Australian\u000d\u000a      Government's international aid agency) as part of its Developmental\u000d\u000a      Leadership Programme (DLP). In 2013, Marquette was approached by AusAid to\u000d\u000a      take over as Director of Research on this $9.5 million programme, and has\u000d\u000a      been described by AusAid as `an active and highly respected contributor to\u000d\u000a      the field of development politics, both in academic and in policy circles'\u000d\u000a      [source 5]. Marquette's research will be funded under this programme until\u000d\u000a      2017 and will feed directly into AusAid's programming. In 2013, Marquette\u000d\u000a      also began work on donors and political economy analysis (PEA). This\u000d\u000a      research draws on textual analysis of PEA frameworks, reports, `how-to\u000d\u000a      guides' and evaluations, as well as semi-structured interviews with donor\u000d\u000a      staff at a number of agencies, consultants and academics working on PEA.\u000d\u000a      It has also involved participant observation in a number of venues,\u000d\u000a      including invitation-only PEA-focused donor workshops, PEA training at\u000d\u000a      donor events (both as participants and as trainers), at PEA `community of\u000d\u000a      practice' meetings bringing together donors and consultants, and in\u000d\u000a      conducting PEA in country.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38868","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Influencing the national and international policy agenda\u000a      Bovaird's original research, together with his close association with\u000a      Governance International, has\u000a      helped shape the public service policy agenda. The Presidency of the EU\u000a      commissioned the five-\u000a      country study of public service co-production [R4], the results of which\u000a      were presented to over a\u000a      thousand public officials at the EU Fifth Quality Conference for Public\u000a      Administration (5QC)(Paris,\u000a      September 2008). The policy conclusions of this study `informed the\u000a        development of the\u000a        Cabinet Office report Co-Production of Public Services\u000a      (2009) significantly' [source 1 below]\u000a      (http:\/\/webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk\/+\/http:\/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk\/media\/207033\/public_services_co-production.pdf).\u000a      Bovaird was also commissioned by the UK Department of\u000a      Communities and Local Government (CLG) to develop the policy implications\u000a      of his research\u000a      findings [R6]. This contributed to the evidence base for the\u000a        Government's 2008 White Paper\u000a      which set out the ways in which it intended to empower communities and\u000a      citizens [source 2].\u000a    Growing policy-maker and professional interest in co-production led\u000a      Governance International and\u000a      the Local Government Information Unit (LGIU - a leading independent think\u000a      tank on local public\u000a      services) to commission and publish a book on how co-production could\u000a      improve health and social\u000a      care outcomes. Bovaird co-edited and contributed to the book, alongside\u000a      chapters in which civil\u000a      servants, local authority councillors and officers, and third-sector\u000a      managers documented their\u000a      experiences with co-production. The Chief Executive of LGIU commented that\u000a      `[t]his very timely\u000a      book ...gives us a glimpse into the future ... [in] this vital area of\u000a      public policy' [source 3]. The book\u000a      was recommended by CLG as a key resource for those local\u000a      authorities introducing co-\u000a      production as part of their neighbourhood budgeting approach [source 4].\u000a    In 2012, Bovaird was invited to give oral evidence to the House of\u000a      Commons Select Committee on\u000a      Communities and Local Government on the potential of co-production for\u000a      public service\u000a      transformation [source 5], further contributing to the development of\u000a        the public service policy\u000a      agenda.\u000a    Influencing the policy and practice of local public service providers\u000a        and commissioners\u000a      Bovaird's research on co-production has led to his involvement in a number\u000a      of policy initiatives. In\u000a      2010, the Local Authorities Research Council Initiative (LARCI), a\u000a      partnership of Research\u000a      Councils UK (RCUK) and local and central government, appointed Bovaird (a\u000a      LARCI Council\u000a      member) as the champion and sponsor of a series of papers on co-production\u000a      [source 6]. This\u000a      series was used as evidence by the Scottish Government's Commission\u000a      on the Future\u000a      Delivery of Public Services when it recommended that `public service\u000a      organisations should\u000a      increasingly develop and adopt positive approaches which build services\u000a      around people and\u000a      communities, their needs, aspirations, capacities and skills' [source 7].\u000a    Subsequently, in 2011, the Scottish Executive commissioned Bovaird and\u000a      Governance\u000a      International to design a programme to that would develop the skills of\u000a      health and social care\u000a      professionals in local authorities, community health partnerships, and\u000a      social care providers across\u000a      Scotland. Since 2012, this development programme has been delivered twelve\u000a      times, reaching\u000a      around 300 policy-makers, senior managers and front-line professionals,\u000a      assisting them in\u000a      realising the public service improvement vision of the Scottish\u000a      Government. The training has now\u000a      been extended to a wider range of public services, initially through a\u000a      national workshop for Police\u000a      Scotland in June 2013. Midlothian Council, who trained 120 senior staff\u000a      through this programme,\u000a      report that Bovaird and his team `help[ed] us roll-out co-production\u000a      quickly... [It] is now a core part... of the Council and is contributing\u000a        to significant improvements in services and important\u000a        efficiency savings' [source 8]. Emerging from this work, Bovaird,\u000a      Governance International and\u000a      the Joint Improvement Team (JIT) (comprising the Scottish Executive Health\u000a      Department, NHS\u000a      Scotland, and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities) produced two\u000a      guides for practitioners\u000a      [source 9]. The JIT Director comments: `We have found Professor Bovaird's\u000a      research invaluable in... delivering the Scottish Government's vision of\u000a      co-production as a reality of public service reform'\u000a      [source 10].\u000a    The `Modelling Birmingham' research forms an important part of Birmingham\u000a      City Council's project\u000a      of transforming its service delivery through co-production to meet the\u000a      challenge of increasing\u000a      community needs in an environment of declining resources. The Council\u000a      comments that the project\u000a      `has already had a number of valuable impacts on public services ...\u000a      (including) identifying\u000a      preventative interventions (and) ... highlighting the potential for\u000a      significant savings' [source 11].\u000a      The City Council also believe it will `have wider effects on UK local\u000a      government' in the future. The\u000a      project won the 2012 IBM Smarter Cities Award and a prize of $500,000 to\u000a      further develop the\u000a      work [source 11].\u000a    Within UK government, the idea of co-production has been connected with\u000a      current policy interest in\u000a      neighbourhood budgeting in order to give communities greater capacity to\u000a      influence those services\u000a      funded by public resources. In 2012, Bovaird was appointed to the CLG's\u000a      Neighbourhood\u000a      Community Budgeting Analytical Advisory Board. In January 2013, Governance\u000a      International and\u000a      Bovaird were commissioned by CLG, Birmingham City Council and the Balsall\u000a      Heath\u000a      Neighbourhood Forum to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the\u000a      Neighbourhood Community\u000a      Budgeting pilot in Balsall Heath. The evaluation resulted in the\u000a        partners placing much greater\u000a        emphasis on bringing the community into service commissioning, design\u000a        and delivery,\u000a        particularly in community safety and local environmental improvement\u000a        services, and thus\u000a        enhancing co-production [source 7].\u000a    In light of this contribution, Bovaird was invited to present on the\u000a      `economy\/diseconomy of scale'\u000a      effects of co-production at a CLG workshop and subsequently at a policy\u000a      roundtable with Danny\u000a      Alexander MP, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, in April 2013. CLG comment\u000a      that they `highly\u000a      value' Bovaird's `personal engagement with the department ... where his\u000a      expertise has helped\u000a        develop, challenge and shape policy thinking ... a notable example\u000a      being his leading\u000a      contribution on economies\/diseconomies of scale' [source 12].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Bovaird's cross-national research has demonstrated that the co-production\u000a      of public services is a\u000a      feasible and effective alternative to traditional,\u000a      professionally-dominated approaches to service\u000a      delivery. His close engagement with government at all levels in the UK, as\u000a      well as the EU, has\u000a      enabled Bovaird to place co-production firmly on the policy agenda and\u000a      assist organisations to\u000a      implement new practices.

His work\u000a      defines co-production as\u000a      `the provision of services through regular, long-term relationships\u000a      between professionalized service\u000a      providers and service users ... where all parties make substantial\u000a      resource contributions' [R1].\u000a    Bovaird's research challenges the ideas and practices of both\u000a      provider-centred public\u000a      administration and market-oriented new public management by showing that\u000a      public services rely\u000a      on the often un-costed and un-acknowledged inputs of users and\u000a      communities. Co-production\u000a      explicitly values such contributions, and Bovaird's work presents the\u000a      intellectual foundation for this\u000a      claim [R1, 2], data to support the argument [R1, 3, 4], and management\u000a      approaches that can be\u000a      used by public authorities actually implementing co-production policies\u000a      [R2, 6]. Overall, it shows\u000a      that co-production is already much more prevalent and significant than\u000a      public officials realise [R4],\u000a      and that it can make a significant contribution to the quality and\u000a      effectiveness of services and, as a\u000a      result, improve outcomes for citizens [R2, 6].\u000a    An important element of the empirical research was a cross-national\u000a      comparative analysis of user\u000a      and community co-production. As part of this work, Bovaird has worked\u000a      closely with Governance\u000a      International (a European non-profit organisation promoting democratic and\u000a      effective public\u000a      services) and with US collaborators. The comparison entailed a survey of\u000a      around 1000 citizens in\u000a      the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, and the UK that explored\u000a      citizens' experience\u000a      of co-production, complemented by focus groups to explore the meanings\u000a      given to co-production\u000a      by different stakeholder groups inside and outside the public sector [R3,\u000a      R4].\u000a    The study concluded that successful and sustainable co-production was\u000a      dependent on institutions\u000a      that are able to combine public sector and citizen inputs in ways that\u000a      make the most of each\u000a      other's resources and strengths. Bovaird's work thus provides significant\u000a      insights into the type of\u000a      contributions made by individuals and groups who use local public\u000a      services, the factors that drive\u000a      this willingness to co-produce, and the cost-effective ways in which\u000a      public agencies can mobilise\u000a      the inputs of service user and community assets.\u000a    His research also compares approaches to co-production that involve\u000a      individual service users with\u000a      those that engage groups or communities. Bovaird concludes that\u000a      co-production designers need\u000a      to understand the different factors that motivate individuals to become\u000a      involved [R3]. He also\u000a      shows that the balance between individual and collective co-production\u000a      varies across types of\u000a      public service and thus that designers need to appreciate the constraints\u000a      on co-production as well\u000a      as its potential [R3, R4]. This insight suggests the need for different\u000a      strategies by public agencies\u000a      both in terms of engaging people in co-production and also in choosing\u000a      those public services\u000a      where co-production is likely to be more effective than others [R5].\u000a    More recently, the `Modelling Birmingham' study has involved Bovaird in\u000a      long-term research\u000a      collaboration with Birmingham City Council to develop an analytical\u000a      technique that can\u000a      demonstrate how inputs from public, private and nonprofit organisations\u000a      combine with those co-\u000a      produced with service users and communities to generate positive outcomes.\u000a      The study involves\u000a      `backwards-mapping' from desired outcomes in order to establish the\u000a      relative effectiveness of\u000a      different service delivery pathways. The research reveals that those\u000a      pathways with a high level of\u000a      user and community inputs are more cost-effective than traditional public\u000a      service approaches [R6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38869","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"7909807","Name":"South Sudan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Jackson's research has resulted in direct involvement in the Nepali peace\u000a      process as well as in the provision of expert advice on security sector\u000a      reform to UK government and other users.\u000a    1. Facilitating implementation of security sector reform in the Nepali\u000a        Peace Process\u000a    Jackson was appointed in 2010 as the only International Adviser to the\u000a      Special Committee of the Nepali Parliament on the Integration and\u000a      Rehabilitation of Maoist Combatants. His appointment arose due to his\u000a      research expertise in the development and implementation of peace\u000a      agreements to end civil wars, and specifically the ways in which\u000a      combatants from opposing factions could be integrated to form new national\u000a      defence forces.\u000a    In Nepal, a ten year insurgency by Maoist guerrillas ended with a peace\u000a      accord in 2006, a central element of which was that Maoist combatants\u000a      would be integrated into the Nepalese Army. Jackson was appointed as\u000a      International Advisor at a critical point in the implementation of the\u000a      peace process. The Nepalese Army was reluctant to permit integration to\u000a      take place due to concerns that the guerrillas were politically\u000a      indoctrinated and would undermine the Army's neutrality, while within the\u000a      Maoist Party there were disagreements about the wisdom of the settlement\u000a      itself. With some 20,000 former Maoist combatants confined to camps in the\u000a      four years since the peace agreement was signed, continued stability was\u000a      dependent on overcoming this political problem.\u000a    Between 2010 and 2013, Jackson was engaged inside the peace process on a\u000a      regular basis. This was a unique contribution given the Nepali\u000a      participants' usual disinclination to include outside experts. Jackson's\u000a      involvement was at the instigation of a senior Nepali official who had\u000a      read his work on security sector reform in post conflict situations, and\u000a      who had previously studied in the International Development Department at\u000a      the University of Birmingham where Jackson is based.\u000a    Jackson's specific contribution has been in facilitating discussions\u000a      between the leadership of the Maoist movement, other political parties and\u000a      the Nepali Army, thus enabling the stalemate between the various factions\u000a      to be overcome. This led directly in 2013 to the\u000a        demobilisation and rehabilitation of the 20,000 Maoist combatants and\u000a        their reintegration into the Nepalese state, some as members of the\u000a      Army and others taking a retirement payment and returning to civilian\u000a      life.\u000a    In undertaking this mediation role, Jackson drew on his research on\u000a      state-building in post-conflict states to shape the perspectives of\u000a      participants' on issues of security and justice, thereby ensuring the\u000a      demystification of the language used in negotiations. In this role, he\u000a      created a space in which safe discussions could take place and agreements\u000a      reached.\u000a    The Chairman of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and a\u000a      former Prime Minister, commented that Jackson's: `thoughtful ideas,\u000a      pragmatic recommendations and profound experience on the integration and\u000a      rehabilitation process have made a substantial contribution to\u000a        conclude[ing] the peace process' (see source 1 below), while HM\u000a      Ambassador to Nepal &#8212; a close observer of the process &#8212; said: 'I have\u000a      little doubt that [Jackson's] sustained engagement and advice has made\u000a        a large contribution to the technical and political discussions on this\u000a        key pillar of the peace process' (source 2).\u000a    2. Shaping the policy and practice of security sector reform\u000a    Jackson's extensive research on security sector reform has underpinned\u000a      his role as a key advisor to UK government and, increasingly,\u000a      non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other national governments\u000a      concerned with bringing peace and stability to conflict zones. Recognition\u000a      of Jackson's expertise led the UK government's Department for\u000a      International Development (DFID) to commission him to undertake an\u000a      independent evaluation of the UK's 1997-2007 peace-building intervention\u000a      in Sierra Leone, following the civil war in that country. Its purpose was\u000a      to document and learn policy and operational lessons that could inform any\u000a      future UK government interventions.\u000a    This policy evaluation produced a book (output R1 above) and a detailed\u000a      policy report for DFID (source 3). This has been complemented by the\u000a      production of a working paper series, published by the GFN-SSR, which\u000a      provides advice to practitioners engaged with SSR programmes. These\u000a      outputs emphasize the significance of engaging with local as well as\u000a      national security actors in peace-building efforts and have been used as a\u000a      resource for the UK government's security and justice training (source 4).\u000a    The UK Government Stabilisation Unit (bringing together efforts of the\u000a      FCO, DFID and the MoD) has described Jackson's work as `very\u000a        influential both in terms of how the policy community thinks about\u000a      security sector reform and how DFID thinks about its own approaches'\u000a      (source 4). The OECD has similarly observed that `the quality of\u000a      (Jackson's) analysis (lies in) his understanding of the international\u000a      policy debate on the issues and his familiarity with the operational\u000a      constraints that actors face, (this) ensures his work feeds directly\u000a        into a broader process of OECD policy development' (source 5).\u000a    Jackson's role has been formalised since 2011 in his role as advisor to\u000a      the Stabilisation Unit and to the DFID Head of Profession on security and\u000a      governance. In these capacities, Jackson has a direct input into UK\u000a      stabilisation policy and evaluation. The Stabilisation Unit has further\u000a      noted that Jackson's `appointment is further proof that he has been\u000a        not only influential but also valued by the UK policy community'\u000a      (source 4).\u000a    Jackson has also been central to the GFN-SSR (2006-2010), a &#163;3.5m\u000a      programme funded by DFID, designed to provide policy-relevant research\u000a      findings directly to the UK government. Over a four-year contract period,\u000a      Jackson designed and delivered a research-based training package\u000a      four times each year. The course was aimed at developing the expertise of\u000a      policymakers in the theory and practice of SSR. In 2010, following the end\u000a      of the contract, Jackson led a consortium involving university, government\u000a      and private contractors in the delivery of Security and Justice training\u000a      across DFID, the MoD, the FCO and the Ministry of Justice, as well as to\u000a      participants from the NGO sector and foreign governments (including\u000a      Germany, the US, Italy, The Netherlands, South Sudan, Nigeria). To date, more\u000a        than 500 UK personnel have been through these senior level courses\u000a      and have thence gone on to be deployed in UK overseas stabilisation\u000a      operations.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Jackson's research on post-conflict state-building has shaped\u000a        processes of international intervention and internal reconciliation\u000a      during and following conflicts in Africa and South Asia.

During this period, Jackson's work has been\u000a      facilitated by a number of research awards: (i) the Global Facilitation\u000a      Network for Security Sector Reform (GFN-SSR), 2006-2010, which\u000a      co-ordinated research and policy findings across a series of international\u000a      research and policy networks; (ii) a DFID award (2008-2010) to investigate\u000a      international intervention during the civil war in Sierra Leone; (iii) an\u000a      ESRC award (2010-2011) to study the relationships of aid-dependent African\u000a      governments with donors; and (iv) an EU Marie Curie grant (2010-2013)\u000a      relating to the local ownership of external peace interventions.\u000a    Jackson's research, which connects issues of decentralisation,\u000a      power-sharing and post-conflict reconstruction, has generated a range of\u000a      publications since 2005 as well as collaboration with a number of\u000a      international bodies &#8212; including the Government of Sweden's Folke\u000a      Bernadotte Academy and the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of\u000a      Armed Forces (DCAF). Both of these bodies explicitly link academic\u000a      research with policy work.\u000a    The insights generated from Jackson's work fall into the following three\u000a      areas:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aSecurity and development, specifically security sector reform,\u000a          demobilisation of combatants and peace-building. Jackson's work\u000a        has identified the need to establish a suitable relationship between the\u000a        governance aspects of security and its technical component (i.e. the\u000a        training and equipping of security forces). Jackson's research shows the\u000a        limitation and lack of depth of much SSR (see output R1 below) and also\u000a        how decisions taken early in peace-building processes can have long term\u000a        implications for political structures (R2-3). In particular, work on the\u000a        transition from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe, and consequent political\u000a        developments regarding former military groups, shows that the aftermath\u000a        of peace agreements can lead to particular forms of authoritarian rule\u000a        (R2). Some of this work was undertaken as part of the process of\u000a        developing the OECD-Development Assistance Committee Guidelines on\u000a        Security Sector Reform, which contributed to the deepening of regional\u000a        networks on SSR in South East Asia, Latin America, South Asia and\u000a        Africa.\u000a      \u000aDecentralisation, power and justice. Jackson's work is\u000a        concerned with the boundary between state and non-state sectors, the\u000a        distribution of power, and the provision of services. His findings on\u000a        these themes have shown how peace-keeping and state-building processes\u000a        are facilitated by an engagement with customary authorities and local\u000a        political structures. This thus highlights the value of developing\u000a        hybrid forms of governance that draw on customary and modernist\u000a        practices, a process that is likely to enhance the political resilience\u000a        of new states (R1, R3, R4-5).\u000a      \u000aState building. Jackson's research also addresses theoretical\u000a        aspects of state building and makes direct links between the `liberal\u000a        peace' approach to states and the practicalities of ensuring state\u000a        capacity on the ground (R3, R6). His research shows that it is important\u000a        for policy makers &#8212; especially those engaged in international\u000a        interventions &#8212; to understand the nature of the state and the meaning\u000a        and practicality of state-building as it applies in different contexts.\u000a        From this, lessons can be drawn on the possibility of designing locally\u000a        appropriate forms of governance to strengthen the capacity of\u000a        communities for security and justice (R1, R3).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39328","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impacts achieved have centred in three areas: improving the quality\u000d\u000a      of debate surrounding the\u000d\u000a      Alternative Vote referendum in May 2011; shaping policy and improving\u000d\u000a      debate in relation to a\u000d\u000a      number of other items on the UK democratic reform agenda; and influencing\u000d\u000a      reform processes\u000d\u000a      elsewhere, most notably in Jersey.

Perhaps the\u000d\u000a      clearest indication of the degree to which Renwick's research was seen as\u000d\u000a      impartially authoritative\u000d\u000a      is that both referendum campaign organizations cited it in their own\u000d\u000a      campaign materials to lend\u000d\u000a      credence to their claims. The impact extended beyond a narrow elite to\u000d\u000a      reach a much broader\u000d\u000a      educated public: the PSA briefing paper was downloaded over 22,000 times\u000d\u000a      in the course of the\u000d\u000a      five-week referendum campaign.\u000d\u000a    In all of these forums, Renwick's research was used to hold the campaign\u000d\u000a      organizations to account\u000d\u000a      for their misrepresentations and to explain what was genuinely at stake in\u000d\u000a      the referendum.\u000d\u000a      Participants in the debates have attested to the value of Renwick's work.\u000d\u000a      Sam Coates of The\u000d\u000a        Times, for example, wrote to the Chief Executive of the Political\u000d\u000a      Studies Association on 2 May\u000d\u000a      2011:\u000d\u000a    Just to say &#8212; in case you hadn't spotted it &#8212; just how excellent and\u000d\u000a      useful your PSA \/ AV\u000d\u000a      briefing has been. I've used it for the third time in a month this\u000d\u000a      morning, to provide\u000d\u000a      academic rigour to some of the nonsense AV debates.\u000d\u000a    Stuart Wilks-Heeg, Executive Director of Democratic Audit, wrote on\u000d\u000a      Democratic Audit's blog on 4\u000d\u000a      July 2011 (http:\/\/www.democraticaudit.com\/?p=288):\u000d\u000a    One of the few prominent voices during the referendum to offer a\u000d\u000a      balanced, evidence-based\u000d\u000a      assessment of the pros and cons of adopting the Alternative Vote was that\u000d\u000a      of Dr\u000d\u000a      Alan Renwick, a Lecturer in Politics at the University of Reading. Dr\u000d\u000a      Renwick's excellent\u000d\u000a      book, A Citizen's Guide to Electoral Reform, published by Biteback\u000d\u000a      in early 2011 was highly\u000d\u000a      effective in translating extensive academic knowledge about electoral\u000d\u000a      systems, including\u000d\u000a      his own comparative study of electoral reform published by Cambridge\u000d\u000a      University Press in\u000d\u000a      2010, into an accessible and `user friendly' text for the general reader.\u000d\u000a    Professor Vicky Randall, who was PSA Chair in 2011, has written:\u000d\u000a    British politics scholars regularly develop mutually useful links and\u000d\u000a      dialogues with politicians\u000d\u000a      and the news media. The Political Studies Association has done much to\u000d\u000a      cultivate such\u000d\u000a      links and to demonstrate the immediate relevance of its expertise for\u000d\u000a      making sense of\u000d\u000a      British politics, perhaps the most impressive recent example being its\u000d\u000a      widely cited briefing\u000d\u000a      paper on the Alternative Vote (Renwick, 2011). (\"Studying British\u000d\u000a      Politics: The Best of\u000d\u000a      Intentions Not Always Realised\", British Politics 7, no. 1 (April\u000d\u000a      2012), 17-29.)\u000d\u000a    Shaping policy and improving debate around UK democratic reform\u000d\u000a      Beyond the referendum, Renwick's work has shaped debates surrounding other\u000d\u000a      mooted reforms\u000d\u000a      too, notably Lords reform and the recall of MPs. He has contributed to\u000d\u000a      both the quality of public\u000d\u000a      debates and the processes of policy-making in Westminster and Whitehall.\u000d\u000a      He has been asked to\u000d\u000a      appear four times before parliamentary select committees investigating\u000d\u000a      Lords reform (31 October\u000d\u000a      and 19 December 2011), the recall of MPs (19 January 2012), and the\u000d\u000a      possibility of a constitutional\u000d\u000a      convention (24 May 2012). He has been commissioned to prepare papers &#8212; in\u000d\u000a      two cases in\u000d\u000a      conjunction with Professor Iain McLean of the University of Oxford &#8212; by\u000d\u000a      the Cabinet Office and\u000d\u000a      Parliament's Joint Select Committee on the Draft House of Lords Reform\u000d\u000a      Bill. He met Cabinet\u000d\u000a      Office officials to discuss Lords reform on 6 July 2012.\u000d\u000a    Debates over Lords reform have often been poorly grounded, proceeding\u000d\u000a      with little understanding\u000d\u000a      of the relevant comparative evidence. Renwick's work has successfully\u000d\u000a      brought such material to\u000d\u000a      the fore. His written and oral evidence to the Lords Reform Committee was\u000d\u000a      cited more than twenty\u000d\u000a      times in the Committee's final report of 26 March 2012 and shaped the\u000d\u000a      Committee's final\u000d\u000a      recommendations on the electoral system appropriate for an elected second\u000d\u000a      chamber. The\u000d\u000a      government's response to this proposal followed Renwick and McLean's\u000d\u000a      advice to the Cabinet\u000d\u000a      Office.\u000d\u000a    Similarly, the evidence given by Renwick to the Political and\u000d\u000a      Constitutional Reform Committee's\u000d\u000a      inquiry into the government's proposals for recall of MPs was repeatedly\u000d\u000a      cited in the Committee's\u000d\u000a      final report of 21 June 2012. The key message of that evidence was that\u000d\u000a      recall would sit uneasily\u000d\u000a      with the parliamentary form of democracy: recall of a senior minister by\u000d\u000a      constituents in one part of\u000d\u000a      the country for policies enacted for the whole country would be\u000d\u000a      undemocratic. This conclusion was\u000d\u000a      reflected in the Committee's recommendations.\u000d\u000a    Influencing reform processes beyond the UK\u000d\u000a      Renwick's impact also extends outside the UK. His dissemination activities\u000d\u000a      include a seminar that\u000d\u000a      he gave to the Foreign Office and DfID in April 2012 regarding electoral\u000d\u000a      system choice in new\u000d\u000a      democracies, focusing particularly on lessons for institutional design in\u000d\u000a      the wake of the `Arab\u000d\u000a      Spring'. In 2012-13, he served as the main expert consultant for the\u000d\u000a      Jersey Electoral Commission,\u000d\u000a      which was appointed to review the island's electoral system in 2012. His\u000d\u000a      recommendations had a\u000d\u000a      major impact on the electoral system that the Commission proposed. They\u000d\u000a      also shaped the form\u000d\u000a      of the referendum that it advocated to decide the fate of those proposals:\u000d\u000a      in April 2013, on\u000d\u000a      Renwick's recommendation, Jersey became only the second jurisdiction in\u000d\u000a      the world to employ a\u000d\u000a      multi-option referendum with preferential voting. The referendum was a\u000d\u000a      success: fears that many\u000d\u000a      ballot papers would be spoilt through confusion were not realized. Reform\u000d\u000a      discussions are\u000d\u000a      ongoing and Renwick gave a public talk about electoral reform options and\u000d\u000a      spoke to members of\u000d\u000a      Jersey's parliament on 10 and 11 September 2013.\u000d\u000a    In each of these three contexts, Renwick has achieved one of the core\u000d\u000a      goals that Political Science\u000d\u000a      departments should aspire to: he has strengthened the quality of our\u000d\u000a      democracy. This important\u000d\u000a      work continues. Major referendums are approaching on Scottish independence\u000d\u000a      and &#8212; possibly &#8212;\u000d\u000a      the UK's membership of the European Union. Renwick has begun detailed\u000d\u000a      research into the\u000d\u000a      factors that promote or inhibit high-quality debate during referendum\u000d\u000a      campaigns and the coming\u000d\u000a      referendums will create further opportunities both to disseminate these\u000d\u000a      findings and to extend the\u000d\u000a      research further. Renwick has thus developed an ongoing, dynamic exchange\u000d\u000a      between research\u000d\u000a      and impact which promises further to strengthen our democratic society in\u000d\u000a      the future.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr Alan Renwick's research has had a distinctive, timely, and invaluable\u000d\u000a      impact on the\u000d\u000a      development of British constitutional debate in recent years. It has\u000d\u000a      improved the quality of public\u000d\u000a      discussion of key electoral and other democratic reforms and strengthened\u000d\u000a      evidence-based\u000d\u000a      decision-making in parliament and government.

Its distinctive contribution is to offer a rich comparative\u000d\u000a      perspective upon how democratic\u000d\u000a      reforms take place (or are blocked) and what effects they can be expected\u000d\u000a      to have.\u000d\u000a      His first book, The Politics of Electoral Reform: Changing the Rules\u000d\u000a        of Democracy, was published\u000d\u000a      by Cambridge University Press in 2010 and concentrated on the question of\u000d\u000a      when and how\u000d\u000a      electoral reforms take place. Using comparative case study methodology and\u000d\u000a      focusing on reform\u000d\u000a      episodes in France, Italy, Japan, and New Zealand, it shows, contrary to\u000d\u000a      the dominant prior view in\u000d\u000a      political science, that public opinion &#8212; and therefore the character of\u000d\u000a      public debate &#8212; can strongly\u000d\u000a      influence democratic reform processes. But public opinion can have such\u000d\u000a      effects only through\u000d\u000a      specific mechanisms, which politicians, activists, and others must\u000d\u000a      understand if they are to engage\u000d\u000a      with ongoing reform processes intelligently. Subsequent research,\u000d\u000a      published in journals such as\u000d\u000a      Electoral Studies, Government &amp; Opposition, and West\u000d\u000a        European Politics, has extended the\u000d\u000a      analysis to over two dozen additional countries, including the UK, and has\u000d\u000a      corroborated and further\u000d\u000a      developed the initial findings. Importantly, it shows that scope for\u000d\u000a      public debates to shape\u000d\u000a      outcomes has increased in recent decades: as political identities have\u000d\u000a      become more fluid and faith\u000d\u000a      in politics has declined, politicians have increasingly sought to court\u000d\u000a      public opinion through\u000d\u000a      reformist rhetoric.\u000d\u000a    Renwick's second book, A Citizen's Guide to Electoral Reform, was\u000d\u000a      published by Biteback in\u000d\u000a      January 2011, four months before the UK's referendum on adopting the\u000d\u000a      Alternative Vote electoral\u000d\u000a      system. It analyses the effects that a variety of possible electoral\u000d\u000a      reforms could be expected to\u000d\u000a      have if implemented in the UK. It includes possible alternatives to the\u000d\u000a      current First Past the Post\u000d\u000a      system, such as the Alternative Vote and various forms of proportional\u000d\u000a      representation, as well as\u000d\u000a      other options prominent on the contemporary UK reform agenda, such as the\u000d\u000a      recall of MPs and\u000d\u000a      greater use of primaries in candidate selection. It identifies six core\u000d\u000a      criteria for the evaluation of\u000d\u000a      different systems and then uses both quantitative and qualitative evidence\u000d\u000a      from 36 democracies in\u000d\u000a      order systematically to weigh the various reform options against these\u000d\u000a      criteria. In the months\u000d\u000a      preceding the referendum, Renwick was commissioned by the UK Political\u000d\u000a      Studies Association\u000d\u000a      (PSA) to conduct further research specifically on the comparison between\u000d\u000a      First Past the Post and\u000d\u000a      the Alternative Vote. This was conducted in consultation with many of the\u000d\u000a      world's leading elections\u000d\u000a      experts and was published by the PSA as a 25-page briefing paper in March\u000d\u000a      2011.\u000d\u000a    Renwick's research extends beyond the electoral system to include other\u000d\u000a      democratic reforms and\u000d\u000a      putative reforms. Notably, in the wake of the publication of the\u000d\u000a      government's white paper and draft\u000d\u000a      bill on reform of the House of Lords in May 2011, he was commissioned,\u000d\u000a      again by the PSA, to\u000d\u000a      complete a detailed study of the government's proposals and their likely\u000d\u000a      effects. As in his previous\u000d\u000a      work, Renwick used a comparative method, drawing insights from 36\u000d\u000a      bicameral democracies\u000d\u000a      around the world, in order to ground conclusions upon solid evidence\u000d\u000a      rather than speculation. This\u000d\u000a      research was published by the PSA as a 96-page briefing paper.\u000d\u000a    Renwick joined the Unit in 2007.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39329","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2215636","Name":"Libya"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Through his research on statebuilding and on corruption, Zaum has become\u000a      a leading authority in\u000a      the field, who has been sought out by policymakers and practitioners. Its\u000a      impact has been much\u000a      facilitated by his appointment in October 2011 to two public-sector\u000a      fellowships, initially held\u000a      simultaneously: the ESRC Public Sector Placement Fellowship held at the\u000a      Stabilisation Unit and\u000a      the Senior Research Fellowship held at DFID (the Stabilisation Unit is the\u000a      UK government's centre\u000a      for expertise and best practice in stabilisation, reporting to DFID, the\u000a      Ministry of Defence, and the\u000a      Foreign Office). These fellowships have enabled him to engage directly\u000a      with these institutions on\u000a      corruption-related issues, especially in the context of fragile and\u000a      conflict-affected states. They also\u000a      supplied the occasion for internal papers and presentations that have\u000a      shaped the way corruption is\u000a      discussed and understood among a wide range of British public servants.\u000a    The research has been disseminated among non-academics through at least\u000a      three different\u000a      channels:\u000a    1) The findings of the Carnegie-funded project on `Power after Peace'\u000a      have been widely presented\u000a      to policymakers and state-building practitioners. In the UK alone, events\u000a      designed to publicise the\u000a      findings have included a large policy conference at Wilton Park in 2011;\u000a      two presentations at the\u000a      Foreign Office (one on the general findings in 2013, and one specifically\u000a      on implications of the\u000a      research for stabilising Libya in 2011); and one each at DFID, the\u000a      Stabilisation Unit (SU), and the\u000a      All-Party Parliamentary Group on Foreign Affairs. Outside the UK, invited\u000a      presentations have been\u000a      given to policy audiences in the US (CSIS and State Department), Norway,\u000a      Sweden, and\u000a      Germany.\u000a    2) Zaum wrote two policy-oriented papers for the Stabilisation Unit on\u000a      corruption and stabilisation.\u000a      These papers have been circulated across Whitehall. One of the SU papers\u000a      has been published on\u000a      the SU's website as a Stabilisation Issue Note in July 2012. These\u000a      Issue Notes are substantial and\u000a      original papers reflecting the SU's understanding of the evidence and good\u000a      practice which `[draw]\u000a      on and amplify UK government policy and thinking on conflict'. On the\u000a      basis of this work, the anti-corruption\u000a      resource centre U4 (which is supported by several leading donor agencies)\u000a      commissioned Zaum to write an additional briefing paper on corruption. The\u000a      research has been\u000a      presented at the SU, DFID, the Land Intelligence Fusion Centre\u000a      Afghanistan, and the Royal\u000a      Military Academy Sandhurst.\u000a    3) Zaum led a research team writing a systematic appraisal of the\u000a      evidence on donor-funded anti-corruption\u000a      interventions for DFID, which showed that strong evidence of efficacy\u000a      existed for only 2\u000a      of the 22 interventions. The findings of the anti-corruption evidence\u000a      appraisal have been formally\u000a      presented to policymakers and practitioners, especially in Whitehall. The\u000a      presentations included a\u000a      large workshop with international partners and NGOs (including the World\u000a      Bank, UNDP, the\u000a      OECD\/DAC, and Transparency International, the leading anti-corruption NGO\u000a      and research\u000a      institute) and a lecture to over 100 DFID conflict and governance advisors\u000a      at their professional\u000a      development conference (2012). It has also included a large number of\u000a      smaller presentations to\u000a      policymakers and practitioners, such as members of the SU, DFID's Fragile\u000a      States and Conflict\u000a      team, the DFID Fraud and Anti-Corruption team, and Foreign Office\u000a      diplomats working in Latin\u000a      America. The anti-corruption evidence appraisal has been peer reviewed and\u000a      published by the U4\u000a      in October 2012 as Mapping Evidence Gaps, enabling it to reach a\u000a      wider audience of practitioners.\u000a    The most immediate impact is that the research has informed and enriched\u000a      debates about\u000a      corruption in fragile and conflict-affected societies within both DFID and\u000a      the SU. The impact\u000a      claimed is not that it has altered the basic principles of the UK's or\u000a      more specifically DFID's anti-corruption\u000a      policy: DFID officially has a `zero-tolerance' policy towards corruption;\u000a      this is neither\u000a      changed nor challenged by Zaum's research. But his dissemination of his\u000a      analysis has had the\u000a      effect of altering perspectives by showing that corruption can contribute\u000a      to stabilising conflict-affected\u000a      states, even though this often comes at the price of entrenched injustice.\u000a      Anti-corruption\u000a      efforts that undermine these arrangements can therefore be destabilising,\u000a      and can fuel violence.\u000a      Evidence for the uptake of this research includes:\u000a    \u000a      The popularity of the Stabilisation Issue Note. The note has\u000a        been downloaded over 300 times\u000a        from the SU Website between September 2012 and February 2013, after\u000a        which the SU no\u000a        longer systematically recorded downloads. This makes it one of the most\u000a        popular downloads\u000a        for this period.\u000a      The use of the note used by senior UK military officers in a NATO\u000a        conference on \"Building\u000a        Integrity\" in Monterey in February 2013 in a presentation on UK thinking\u000a        on the subject\u000a      Inclusion of the note in the reading pack prepared for DFID's\u000a        Governance and Conflict Advisors\u000a        Professional Development Conference in Leeds in December 2012.\u000a      Use of the note by the Transition Planning Team for the Helmand\u000a        Provincial Reconstruction\u000a        Team (PRT) in their post-2013 transition planning. The transition\u000a        advisor to the head of the\u000a        PRT, Peter Rundell, confirmed that the paper `affected the way we in the\u000a        PRT...thought about\u000a        corruption and planned anti-corruption work'.\u000a      A presentation on the note to the Land Intelligence Fusion Centre\u000a        (Afghanistan), at a workshop\u000a        informing their planning and analysis of developments in Afghanistan\u000a        post-2013. In the\u000a        judgement of the Centre's commander, Lt.Col. Andrew Perrey, this helped\u000a        LIFC(A) `to view the\u000a        challenges relating to Afghanistan from a very different perspective\u000a        than their usual military\u000a        one'.\u000a      Continuing demand for similar work: at the end of the assessment\u000a        period Zaum was\u000a        commissioned to write a briefing Note for publication by U4 on\u000a        corruption in fragile and conflict-affected\u000a        states, and to present on the issue to senior military officers at the\u000a        Royal Defence\u000a        College in October 2013.\u000a    \u000a    On the more specialised question of what works &#8212; and does not &#8212; in\u000a      anti-corruption, the Mapping\u000a        Evidence Gaps paper highlighted that there is strong evidence for\u000a      the effectiveness of only two\u000a      anti-corruption interventions: public financial management reforms; and\u000a      supreme audit institutions.\u000a      For the remaining 22 interventions, the evidence was either fair or weak,\u000a      or the findings were\u000a      contested. For advisors who are developing anti-corruption programmes,\u000a      this constitutes important\u000a      evidence for their business cases. Evidence of its impact includes:\u000a    \u000a      The appearance of the paper in a list of top-12 readings for DFID\u000a        advisors on anti-corruption.\u000a      The use of the paper's findings to set the research agenda for a\u000a        proposed &#163;10 million DFID\u000a        operationally oriented research programme, to strengthen the evidence\u000a        base for its anti-corruption\u000a        interventions.\u000a      The use of the paper as background reading and in training sessions\u000a        for DFID country offices\u000a        for writing anti-corruption and counter-fraud strategies. 29 country\u000a        offices, which design and\u000a        manage development programmes, have now adopted such strategies.\u000a      Its popularity as a download from the U4 anti-corruption resource site\u000a        (www.u4.no), a donor-funded\u000a        resource centre not confined to UK government employees, suggests that\u000a        it is also\u000a        having a wider impact on corruption debates amongst researchers and\u000a        practitioners beyond\u000a        DFID.\u000a    \u000a    Zaum has taken social-scientific findings informed by properly rigorous\u000a      comparative research to the\u000a      officials who have found them practically useful. The immediate\u000a      beneficiaries have been DFID and\u000a      the SU, whose understanding of what works and what does not work in\u000a      anti-corruption, and of the\u000a      effect of corruption on stabilisation and state-building environments, has\u000a      improved. As a result of\u000a      DFID's influential role and `thought leadership' on many development\u000a      issues, the benefits have\u000a      extended to other development and state-building actors, most strikingly\u000a      to soldiers based in\u000a      Afghanistan at several removes from Zaum himself. As corruption is both a\u000a      key challenge to the\u000a      effectiveness of development and a key source of insecurity in any state\u000a      recovering from conflict, it\u000a      would be hard to exaggerate his impact's social value.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact of Professor Dominik Zaum's research is a model of how to\u000a      bring novel and\u000a      imaginative scholarship into the practical world of policymaking. The\u000a      research, which was\u000a      conducted within the UoA, examined the role of corruption in the political\u000a      economy of statebuilding\u000a      and stabilisation efforts. Its impact has derived from two achievements:\u000a      it has shown that some\u000a      forms of corruption can, in some circumstances, have stabilising effects;\u000a      and it has produced a\u000a      rigorous assessment of what works &#8212; and what does not work &#8212; in\u000a      donor-funded anti-corruption\u000a      efforts. It has thus influenced and informed the debates of policy-makers\u000a      in the Department for\u000a      International Development (DFID) and the inter-departmental Stabilisation\u000a      Unit (SU: the UK\u000a      government's centre for expertise and best practice in stabilisation). The\u000a      impact of Zaum's work\u000a      has been both recognised and amplified by fellowships with DFID and the\u000a      SU. This has enabled\u000a      Zaum himself to accentuate the impact through formal presentations,\u000a      informal internal discussion,\u000a      and implementation-oriented publications, thus influencing the\u000a      perspectives of a policymaking\u000a      community both inside and beyond these institutions. The impact can be\u000a      evidenced through such\u000a      measures as downloads of his policy papers, the use of these papers in\u000a      training and as resources,\u000a      and through the testimony of officials.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    University of Reading\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Reading (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Reading","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007802}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1140043","Name":"Helmand"}],"References":"\u000a    Publications by Professor Dominik Zaum.

While state- and peace-building\u000a      scholarship has been a rapidly growing field, there has been little\u000a      thorough investigation of\u000a      the effect of specific state-building policies and practices, including\u000a      anti-corruption policies. For the\u000a      last five years, his research has therefore focussed on the effect of\u000a      state-building and stabilisation\u000a      efforts on the political economy of fragile and conflict-affected states,\u000a      including work on corruption\u000a      and anti-corruption practices. This has involved conceptual work,\u000a      especially on corruption, as well\u000a      as desk- and field-based empirical research. The main research question\u000a      underlying these efforts\u000a      has been: what is the effect of contemporary state-building activities on\u000a      conflict-affected societies?\u000a     Zaum's first book (completed at Reading) was The Sovereignty Paradox:\u000a        The Norms and Politics\u000a        of International State-Building (2007). His subsequent research\u000a      (conceived and carried through at\u000a      Reading) has shifted focus from the character of state-building\u000a      interventions to their effects,\u000a      specifically their effects on the political economy of conflict-affected\u000a      countries. This problem has\u000a      been largely unaddressed by the existing academic and non-academic\u000a      literature, but is relevant to\u000a      the urgent practical need to hinder a relapse to violence. In 2009, Zaum\u000a      undertook a project co-directed\u000a      with Professor Mats Berdal of King's College London entitled `Power after\u000a      Peace: The\u000a      Political Economy of Post-Conflict State-building', supported by a\u000a      $390,000 grant from the\u000a      International Peace and Security Programme of the Carnegie Corporation of\u000a      New York. This\u000a      project has highlighted in particular the different ways in which\u000a      state-building interventions have\u000a      frequently inadvertently entrenched war-time and pre-war economic and\u000a      political structures (rather\u000a      than transforming them), and the important role of informal (often\u000a      war-time) institutions in post-war\u000a      transitions. Both are often ignored by current state-building and\u000a      stabilisation policymakers. The\u000a      project has resulted in a range of workshops with policymakers and\u000a      practitioners &#8212; including a large\u000a      conference at Wilton Park (an executive agency of the UK Foreign and\u000a      Commonwealth\u000a      Office providing a global forum for strategic discussion) &#8212; to engage them\u000a      in the research process,\u000a      and in a major co-edited volume.\u000a    This line of research has been complemented by more specialised work on\u000a      corruption and state-building\/peacebuilding\u000a      interventions; in particular, a World Bank-funded project that resulted in\u000a      a\u000a      co-edited (with Christine Cheng) special issue of the journal International\u000a        Peacekeeping and a co-edited\u000a      book, Corruption and Post-conflict Peacebuilding: Selling the Peace?,\u000a      which updated and\u000a      extended the contributions to the special issue, and is the first\u000a      book-length treatment of the\u000a      problem. Six of its chapters, including the chapter by the editors, were\u000a      included in the anti-corruption\u000a      background paper for the landmark 2011 World Bank World Development Report\u000a      on\u000a      Conflict, Security and Development.\u000a    Zaum's research into corruption and the political economy of\u000a      state-building\u000a    \u000a      Uncovered how external interventions often inadvertently entrench\u000a        existing informal political\u000a        and economic structures, including structures and relationships\u000a        characterised by corruption;\u000a      Distinguished between two separate effects of corruption. While\u000a        corruption undermines\u000a        `vertical' state-building &#8212; the emergence and consolidation of a social\u000a        contract structured\u000a        around formal governance institutions and the provision of basic public\u000a        services &#8212; and\u000a        frequently fuels insecurity, it can, however, be central to `horizontal'\u000a        state-building; managing\u000a        and stabilising the relationships between different politically salient\u000a        identity groups, and\u000a        between these groups and state institutions.\u000a      Demonstrated, in consequence, that certain forms of corruption can\u000a        contribute to stabilising\u000a        conflict-affected states, even though this often comes at the price of\u000a        entrenched injustice.\u000a        Corruption can be central to the maintenance of elite settlements that\u000a        strengthen state\u000a        resilience against violence. Anti-corruption efforts that undermine\u000a        these settlements can\u000a        therefore be destabilising, and can fuel violence.\u000a    \u000a    On the basis of such insights, Zaum was awarded an ESRC Public Sector\u000a      Placement Fellowship\u000a      (2011-12) &#8212; one of only nine knowledge exchange fellowships in the public,\u000a      private and third sector\u000a      awarded by the ESRC in 2010\/11 - and a Senior Research Fellowship in\u000a      Conflict and Fragility at\u000a      DFID (2011 - 2013). As part of these fellowships, Zaum has produced\u000a      further work of intellectual\u000a      value for a non-academic audience, including: an internal paper and a\u000a      Stabilisation Issue Note on\u000a      Addressing Corruption in Stabilisation Environments (2012); and a\u000a      critical evaluation of the\u000a      evidence about the effect of donor-supported anti-corruption\u000a      interventions. This critique was peer-reviewed\u000a      and later published by U4 (the leading anti-corruption resource centre for\u000a      donor\u000a      practitioners) as Mapping Evidence Gaps in Anti-Corruption (2012).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39330","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Gray's research has been disseminated widely through professional and\u000d      public policy outlets as well as conventional academic channels, with a\u000d      view to influencing a transatlantic community of defence professionals.\u000d      The curricula of staff colleges, military academies, and similar\u000d      institutions have been shaped by a major textbook, co-edited by Gray with\u000d      John Baylis and James Wirtz, Strategy in the Contemporary World\u000d      (2002; updated editions in 2007, 2010, 2013). Similar influence has been\u000d      exerted by a collection co-edited by Gray &#8212; The Practice of Strategy:\u000d        From Alexander the Great to the President (2010) &#8212; which was\u000d      praised, for example, by Sir Richard Shirreff, the Deputy Supreme Allied\u000d      Commander Europe, as `a clear-thinking analysis which is both timely and\u000d      relevant and I commend it to decision maker and general reader alike.'\u000d      Although the consistent intention has been to serve professional needs by\u000d      informing enriching and framing professional debates, Gray's entertaining\u000d      and informal style has been accessible to general readers. Another\u000d        Bloody Century: Future Warfare is an important academic statement,\u000d      but it was deliberately published through a non-academic publisher to make\u000d      its standpoint available to a much wider public. Similarly, the five\u000d      monographs commissioned by the Strategic Studies Institute are available\u000d      free of charge in hard copy and online. Important statements have been\u000d      placed in the most widely read of the more specialised security journals:\u000d      the RUSI (Royal United Services Institute) Journal, PRISM\u000d      (published online by the National Defense University) and Parameters\u000d      (published online by the US Army War College). These statements have also\u000d      affected a wider audience. For example, Gray's critique of COIN\u000d      (counterinsurgency) in PRISM sparked a debate in June 2012 on the\u000d      influential blogsite of the Pulitzer Prize winner and defence expert\u000d      Thomas E. Ricks, The Best Defense, in the course of which Ricks\u000d      incidentally noted that 'Gray also made me think I should go back and read\u000d      Thucydides again.'\u000d    In the course of the 2008-2013 period, this wide dissemination has had\u000d      impact in three ways. First, the research has influenced civilian\u000d        policymakers. In the UK, both the Labour Government and the incoming\u000d      Coalition Government appointed Gray to advisory bodies. To assist the UK's\u000d      2010-11 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the government requested\u000d      him to participate on the Defence Advisory Forum on the Defence Green\u000d      Paper Adaptability and Partnership: Issues for the Strategic Defence\u000d        Review (2010). Moreover, in an important policy speech delivered at\u000d      the National Defence University in September 2008, the long-serving US\u000d      Secretary of Defence Robert M. Gates invoked the research on the\u000d      inadequacies of artificial categories such as 'irregular warfare', and the\u000d      need for a holistic strategic vision. In 2012, Republican presidential\u000d      candidate Mitt Romney appointed Gray to his Counter-Proliferation Working\u000d      Group. In a speech on British maritime security in 2012, Minister for the\u000d      Armed Forces Sir Nick Harvey cited Gray's arguments about the practical\u000d      orientation of strategic theory.\u000d    Secondly, the research has informed and structured debates among\u000d        military leaders in all three of the UK Armed Services, so much so\u000d      that the service chiefs routinely refer to Gray',s thinking. In his 2011\u000d      autobiography, former Chief of the General Staff Sir Richard Dannatt\u000d      quoted Gray's Another Bloody Century in making the case for\u000d      redesigning British armed forces away from episodic discrete wars and\u000d      towards a state of continuous campaign readiness. The Royal Air Force has\u000d      invited Gray to be Director of Air Power Studies, while, the Chief of the\u000d      Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton, quoted Gray in his Lord\u000d      Trenchard Memorial Lecture in 2009 on the role of the RAF as a mobile\u000d      force of power projection. Above all, however, the research is central to\u000d      the self-understanding of the Navy: Gray's view of its role and importance\u000d      has demonstrably informed the personal attitudes of naval leaders as\u000d      evidenced by the way that they articulate its function. Unusually for a\u000d      doctrinal statement, Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP)0-10 British\u000d        Maritime Doctrine actually quotes Gray twice. The epigraph to the\u000d      Navy's online `Fact Sheet' is Gray's well-known remark that `the greatest\u000d      value of the Navy will be found in events that fail to occur.' The former\u000d      First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, made\u000d      use of Gray's words to conclude his Remembrance Day Address of 2011 to the\u000d      Henry Jackson Society.\u000d    Thirdly, the research has affected the attitudes and practices of an\u000d        international community of defence professionals, especially when\u000d      adapting to new problems. The Dean of Academics of the US Army War College\u000d      wrote to Gray in 2009 that his monograph Schools for Strategy\u000d      'could not have come at a more propitious time', and recommended it to his\u000d      staff to inform the 'epistemological debate on how to teach strategy.'\u000d      Lieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper reported that Gray's critique of the\u000d      RMA concept influenced him and fellow admirers, who 'would return to\u000d      Gray's writings often as they argued against the purported visionaries'\u000d      technically focused plans for the future force.' In 2013, US Strategic\u000d      Command requested his advice on the value of Dual Capable aircraft for\u000d      NATO. More recently (August 2013), US Army Special Operations Command\u000d      requested advice while noting that `your work has naturally informed our\u000d      discussions here' on the subject of a proposed `operational concept for\u000d      space.' Perhaps the most sensitive index of the reach and depth of the\u000d      research's service to the international defence community community is its\u000d      extensive presence not just on the syllabus of mainstream professional\u000d      training, but also on more informal reading lists through which\u000d      non-academics have revealed the works they have found practically useful.\u000d      Thus UK Chief of Defence Staff General Sir David Richards included The\u000d        Strategy Bridge (2010) on his list of recommended books and articles\u000d      for officers. When The Diplomatic Courier, a global\u000d      diplomatic-affairs magazine, included The Strategy Bridge on its\u000d      2012 reading list, it noted that Gray was `by far the most selected\u000d      writer' recommended by its panel of advisers.\u000d    As such remarks suggest, Gray's work has characteristics that make it\u000d      very attractive to reflective security experts; no academic strategist of\u000d      comparably global reputation is found so readily usable by serving\u000d      officers. But in spite of his large following among professionals, Gray's\u000d      primary aim is not to offer technical advice, but to locate and frame\u000d      debates correctly. The impact that is claimed for the research is not, for\u000d      example, that the US operational concept for space will adopt some\u000d      detailed practical recommendations directly traceable to Gray himself, but\u000d      that the initial discussions that took place were, as a matter of course,\u000d      informed by Airpower for strategic effect (2010) and allied\u000d      writings. As an academic who straddles the worlds of strategic studies and\u000d      of military planning, Gray has delimited a field of study, defended its\u000d      integrity and coherence, especially in its relation to advanced\u000d      professional training, and shaped the self-understanding of its\u000d      practitioners.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    Professor Colin Gray's research into strategic theory, conducted at the\u000d      University of Reading, has had a sustained, distinctive, and international\u000d      impact on policymakers, military educationalists, and other defence\u000d      professionals.

His theory of strategy defends the distinct and irreplaceable\u000d      character of strategy as an activity by showing how classical theorists,\u000d      especially Clausewitz, supply an intellectual foundation on which to\u000d      develop strategic judgement today. In Gray's view, strategy is distinct\u000d      from such related practices as military history, military administration,\u000d      and even academic `war studies'. It is an implication of his standpoint\u000d      that strategists who work within a university setting are engaged in an\u000d      activity at least continuous with those of generals and admirals. Gray's\u000d      research has created a holistic framework through which armed conflict or\u000d      the threat of it can be understood, and within which particular topics\u000d      (such as counterinsurgency theory, airpower, and cyberwar) can be\u000d      discussed.\u000d    The research has been presented in two contrasting major works - Another\u000a        Bloody Century (2005), and The Strategy Bridge: Theory for\u000d        Practice (the first volume of a trilogy: 2010) - which are widely\u000d      acknowledged as setting the agenda for specialist discussion among a\u000d      global readership both of strategic studies academics and of non-academic\u000d      defence professionals. In the words of leading US. military historian\u000d      Dennis E. Showalter, Gray `has sustained and enhanced a reputation as the\u000d      English-speaking world's leading strategic thinker.' His theory's uniquely\u000d      comprehensive character is one of the the foundations of its impact; in\u000d      the judgement of Professor Christopher Coker, `none has been so consistent\u000d      in trying to develop a general theory'.\u000d    The impact of this theory has been much amplified by its vindication by\u000d      the course of military events: in reviving and adapting classical theory,\u000d      the research opposed such fashions as the belief that `new wars' had made\u000d      traditional thinking obsolete or the short-lived and now discredited view\u000d      that a technologically-driven `Revolution in Military Affairs' will give\u000d      Western forces dominance of any battlespace. In opposition to such rival\u000d      views, Gray argues that war remains a political act, in which the military\u000d      instrument must be subordinated to policy goals and where the role of\u000d      strategy is to function as the 'bridge' between the two. He notes that\u000d      military establishments are perennially drawn to seductive 'big ideas'\u000d      appearing to offer a simplified key to their problems. These are bound to\u000d      disappoint, because war is not a mechanistic, scientifically exact\u000d      exercise, but rather a violent and chaotic interaction that has to be\u000d      addressed through a distinctive form of thinking that is as much political\u000d      as it is technical.\u000d    Within the academic world, Gray's research is an acknowledged reference\u000d      point: the criticisms that have been levelled at it (for example by\u000d      Professor Sir Hew Strachan) have taken for granted its status as the\u000d      principal expression of a distinctive view of strategy with widespread\u000d      influence on practitioners. Its arguments have been elaborated and applied\u000d      through rigorous discussions of a variety of emergent problems, many of\u000d      them commissioned as contributions to the monograph series of the\u000d      Strategic Studies Institute of the US Army War College. These writings\u000d      have examined, inter alia, the new domain of cyber power; the\u000d      limits of air power; the problems of irregular wars; and the intersection\u000d      between doctrinal, institutional and technological change.\u000d    Particular attention has been given to the appropriate form of education\u000d      for the transmission of strategic thinking; in his monograph, Schools\u000d        for Strategy (2009), and elsewhere, Gray has functioned as a\u000d      theorist of military education, especially education for higher command,\u000d      defending Clausewitz's view that strategy develops a general form of\u000d      military judgement. Each of these contributions has drawn policy\u000d      conclusions from a broad theory of strategy, and in so doing supports the\u000d      claim that policy professionals in any historical era can draw upon the\u000d      resources of the classical heritage to analyse contemporary problems. For\u000d      example, the research shows that classical theory is a better guide to the\u000d      limits and capabilities of air power than modern visions of the use of\u000d      bombing. Its uncompromising pursuit of the discipline of strategy as\u000d      classically conceived has thus been a means of defending the role of\u000d      strategy in officer training and military planning.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40296","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 2008 Childs' research has improved women's parliamentary\u000d\u000a      representation in the UK by influencing thinking, agendas, legislation and\u000d\u000a      political practices in the following ways:\u000d\u000a    Agenda setting, legislation and changing political practices:\u000d\u000a      Childs' lead co-authored Hansard Report of 2005 [2] was featured on Radio\u000d\u000a      4's flagship `Today' programme, commented on in Parliament's House\u000d\u000a      magazine and launched in Parliament &#8212; the Rt Hon Theresa May (then Shadow\u000d\u000a      Secretary of State for Transport and former Party Chairman) spoke to the\u000d\u000a      Report's conclusions [d].

During this time, Childs\u000d\u000a      also participated in a private meeting with MPs and the Independent\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) to discuss MPs' pay and expenses,\u000d\u000a      and possible impacts on the supply of women candidates [a]. The Speaker's\u000d\u000a      Conference published its final Report in January 2010. It included\u000d\u000a      analysis, data, conceptual frameworks and recommendations which drew on\u000d\u000a      Childs' research [1] [2] [3] [4]. The Report included the following\u000d\u000a      recommendations influenced by Childs: paragraph 143 relating to parties'\u000d\u000a      equality policies; the extension to the Sex Discrimination (EC) Act sunset\u000d\u000a      clause; discussion of sex quotas [11] [4], including `serious\u000d\u000a      consideration' of prescriptive quotas; reviewing House sitting hours,\u000d\u000a      party selection procedures and outcome monitoring; and regular\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary debate on women's representation. Parties now monitor\u000d\u000a      selection more and provide some data, and the sunset clause was extended\u000d\u000a      in the 2010 Equality Act. The concept of `critical mass' &#8212; which retains\u000d\u000a      considerable purchase amongst political actors, the media and public &#8212; was\u000d\u000a      not directly used in the Report due to Childs' intervention [3]. The\u000d\u000a      Labour Party's 2010 General Election manifesto said that it would `take\u000d\u000a      forward' the Conference's proposals [g] and continues to use sex quotas.\u000d\u000a    Following up the Conference on pay, participation and parenting:\u000d\u000a      Since the Conference, Childs has extended the agenda-setting impact of her\u000d\u000a      research on three issues related to its work, namely pay, increased\u000d\u000a      women's political participation, and parenting. On pay, the 2010 IPSA\u000d\u000a      consultation document raised the issue of the relationship between salary\u000d\u000a      and diversity of candidates. Childs was amongst a group of academics who\u000d\u000a      participated in IPSA meetings in 2012 to discuss MPs' pay [a]. In these\u000d\u000a      sessions Childs made contributions based on her previous research on the\u000d\u000a      issues of, inter alia, job-sharing by MPs and childcare costs due to the\u000d\u000a      nature of MPs' work and hence the need for a higher salary, which IPSA has\u000d\u000a      recommended [1] [6]. On participation and representation, the Conference,\u000d\u000a      and Childs' role therein, contributed to the creation in 2010 of the civil\u000d\u000a      society campaign group Counting Women In (www.countingwomenin.org)\u000d\u000a      which combines the Electoral Reform Society, Hansard Society, Fawcett\u000d\u000a      Society, Centre for Women and Democracy and Unlock Democracy. Childs and\u000d\u000a      Ruth Fox (Director and Head of Research of the Hansard Society) wrote the\u000d\u000a      group's founding charter and helped to set up its organisational structure\u000d\u000a      [e]. Childs continues to be an active member. Childs appeared as an expert\u000d\u000a      witness before the Commons Procedure Committee in 2011 in relation to\u000d\u000a      sitting hours due to her research on that issue [1] [4] [6] and submitted\u000d\u000a      written evidence. This issue remains live on the agenda of parliamentary\u000d\u000a      reformers. On parenting, Childs and Campbell (Birkbeck) submitted to IPSA\u000d\u000a      research they conducted in 2012-13 on the need for family-friendly hours\u000d\u000a      in the House to lower this barrier to participation. The research was\u000d\u000a      facilitated by the Speaker and Anne Foster, Parliament's Head of Diversity\u000d\u000a      and Inclusion.\u000d\u000a    Promoting adoption of strong equality promotion measures in the\u000d\u000a        Conservative Party: Awareness in the Conservative Party of women's\u000d\u000a      under-representation has been heightened by Childs' research [c] [d].\u000d\u000a      Leading Conservative women, including Baroness Jenkin [c] and Theresa May\u000d\u000a      [d], drew on Childs' research [1] [2] in their creation of a new group\u000d\u000a      within the party -Women2Win www.women2win.com\u000d\u000a      &#8212; in 2005 which advocates a gender balance of candidates that reflects the\u000d\u000a      composition of British society overall. Childs spoke at Women2Win's launch\u000d\u000a      and at its fifth anniversary conference in 2010. There has been particular\u000d\u000a      interest in the Conservative Party in Childs' identification of specific\u000d\u000a      party-level strategies to enhance women's representation, and to address\u000d\u000a      the party's lack of `demand' for women candidates [2] [c] [d]. Childs was\u000d\u000a      also invited to meet with individuals from David Cameron's team in advance\u000d\u000a      of his election as leader in December 2005. Women's representation became\u000d\u000a      a key dimension of Cameron's leadership campaign and subsequent party\u000d\u000a      modernization which included a series of selection reforms prior to the\u000d\u000a      2010 General Election. In his evidence to the Speaker's Conference [f] in\u000d\u000a      2009 Cameron stated that the party would introduce some All Women\u000d\u000a      Shortlists in advance of the election, a measure which Childs had\u000d\u000a      championed in her research [1] [2] [4] and within the Conference, in\u000d\u000a      Woment2Win and when meeting Cameron's team. Childs had private\u000d\u000a      conversations with Theresa May during her tenure as Shadow Secretary of\u000d\u000a      State for Work and Pensions 2009-10 [d]. Childs has provided May with\u000d\u000a      research-based data and arguments [4] [5] which have supported May's\u000d\u000a      advocacy efforts among her senior colleagues. Aiming at the next General\u000d\u000a      Election, Baroness Jenkin met with No. 10 in 2011 armed with a briefing by\u000d\u000a      Childs on selection reforms based on research published the following year\u000d\u000a      [5] [6]. Following the establishment of a new Conservative parliamentary\u000d\u000a      grouping in December 2011 &#8212; the Conservative Women's Organisation www.conservativewomen.org.uk\u000d\u000a      &#8212; Childs briefed Conservative MPs on arguments, data and reform derived\u000d\u000a      from her research in progress [5] [6] [c].\u000d\u000a    Promoting sex-balanced leadership in the Labour Party: Childs'\u000d\u000a      book on New Labour women MPs [1] in particular has contributed to her\u000d\u000a      decade-long academic association with leading Labour women MPs, not least\u000d\u000a      the Rt Hon Harriet Harman (whose posts since 2008 have included Leader of\u000d\u000a      the House of Commons and Secretary of State for Equalities and Minister\u000d\u000a      for Women) and Dame Anne Begg (Vice-Chairman of the Speaker's Conference)\u000d\u000a      [a]. In 2010 Childs participated in a private meeting of the Fabian\u000d\u000a      Society to discuss gender and the Labour leadership contest. In 2011, at\u000d\u000a      Harman's invitation, Childs was a lead author of the Political Studies\u000d\u000a      Association's Women and Politics Specialist Group briefing to Harman on\u000d\u000a      sex-balancing Labour's leadership. The briefing identified mechanisms such\u000d\u000a      as the Leader and Deputy Leader having to be of different sexes that would\u000d\u000a      deliver that outcome: the measures are still being considered.\u000d\u000a    Promoting action by the Liberal Democrats on women's\u000d\u000a        under-representation: Early in 2013 Childs presented written and\u000d\u000a      oral evidence to the party's investigation into women's representation at\u000d\u000a      Westminster. Based on her research [1] [4] [5], Childs argued for sex\u000d\u000a      quotas and job-shares. The party has been exploring the issue of MP\u000d\u000a      job-shares as of February 2013 [i] and and it became public in October\u000d\u000a      2013 that the Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is\u000d\u000a      considering the adoption of All Women Shortlists for the 2020 General\u000d\u000a      Election [j].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Professor Sarah Childs has had wide-ranging influence in\u000d\u000a      relation to improving women's parliamentary representation in the UK. This\u000d\u000a      impact has taken the following forms. First, through her role as\u000d\u000a      Specialist Adviser to the Speaker's Conference (2008-10), Childs helped\u000d\u000a      set the agenda around the multiple issues and political practices\u000d\u000a      (including legislative ones) that determine women's political\u000d\u000a      representation. Second, she followed up on the Conference by presenting\u000d\u000a      proposals on MPs' pay, assisting in the development of the Counting Women\u000d\u000a      In campaign, and drawing attention to the implications of parenting for\u000d\u000a      parliamentary representation. Third, Childs' research has been significant\u000d\u000a      in promoting the adoption of strong equality promotion measures in the\u000d\u000a      Conservative Party. This includes helping to secure acceptance in\u000d\u000a      principle in 2009 by the then Leader of the Opposition David Cameron of\u000d\u000a      All Women Shortlists. Her interventions have also accentuated the issue of\u000d\u000a      women's representation in the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties,\u000d\u000a      resulting in support for some of the measures Childs has advocated at the\u000d\u000a      highest levels of those organizations. Thus, due in part to her research\u000d\u000a      and argumentation, it is now more accepted amongst party elites and\u000d\u000a      grassroots members alike, in all three principal UK political parties,\u000d\u000a      that women's representation continues to be inadequate and requires urgent\u000d\u000a      redress. More broadly, Childs has made political, public and civil society\u000d\u000a      actors, as well as the wider public, more cognizant of the democratic\u000d\u000a      deficit incurred when women, and women's interests and perspectives, are\u000d\u000a      absent, under-represented or marginalized in parliamentary politics.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Bristol\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Outputs:\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Childs, S.

She therefore provides a\u000d\u000a      specific analytical angle into the gendered nature of political\u000d\u000a      institutions\/parties, and gendered political change.

Women MPs are more likely to `act for'\u000d\u000a      women than male MPs by raising women's concerns in Parliament through\u000d\u000a      parliamentary questions, debates, Early Day Motions and select committees,\u000d\u000a      and informally influencing party and governmental policy [1] [2] [4] [5]\u000d\u000a      [8] (see also Childs, Withey in Parliamentary Affairs and Political\u000a        Studies, 2006, 2004 respectively; Childs led on these, with Withey\u000d\u000a      as research assistant).\u000d\u000a    That the concept of `critical actors' should replace that of `critical\u000d\u000a        mass', the once dominant gender and politics analytic framework.\u000d\u000a      Childs and Krook's critique [3] [4] [8] has transformed subsequent\u000d\u000a      research in this area (Krook was an ESRC post-doctoral fellow at Bristol\u000d\u000a      in 2004-05). The relationship between women's descriptive and substantive\u000d\u000a      representation is best conceived as complex and mediated (Celis, Childs,\u000d\u000a      Kantola, Krook 2008 in Representation; Celis and Childs 2008 in Political\u000a        Studies). An associated European Consortium of Political Research\u000d\u000a      (ECPR) Joint Sessions of Workshop co-directed with Celis (Brussels)\u000d\u000a      resulted in two peer-reviewed Special Issues (Representation and\u000d\u000a        Parliamentary Affairs, both 2008).\u000d\u000a    That scholars of gender and politics need to take seriously the views\u000d\u000a        of Conservative representatives. This research derived from the\u000d\u000a      preceding work on critical mass [3] [4] [8] and the ESRC funded research\u000d\u000a      on the UK Conservative Party [5] [8]. It included exploration of how the\u000d\u000a      `represented' are constituted during the processes of representation.\u000d\u000a      Again, it led to further research and outputs: Celis and Childs 2011 in Political\u000a        Studies, a second co-directorship of an ECPR workshop in 2012, and\u000d\u000a      an edited ECPR book (Celis and Childs forthcoming 2014).\u000d\u000a    The importance of empirical research to understandings of gendered\u000d\u000a        institutions.

This section\u000a      of the case study is divided into three parts: pathways to impact, impact\u000a      during 2008-13 on thinking and on design of governance programmes, and the\u000a      reach and significance of the impact.\u000a    Pathways to impact\u000a    In 2005-06 Gainsborough was seconded to the UNDP in Hanoi as Senior\u000a      Technical Advisor to the Doi Moi Review, a $1.5 million project seeking to\u000a      learn lessons from twenty years of reform. During this time, Gainsborough\u000a      had extensive exposure to both the Vietnamese government and the\u000a      international donor community, allowing him to develop formal and informal\u000a      ties with a wide range of donors in addition to UNDP. As a member of the\u000a      donor community, Gainsborough attended official meetings and was able to\u000a      bring his expertise to bear in a wide range of fora, notably in relation\u000a      to debates on corruption. Key dialogue partners at this time were the\u000a      World Bank, the UK's Department for International Development (DfID),\u000a      AusAID and the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA).\u000a      Gainsborough's role in this review gave him an excellent opportunity to\u000a      show the relevance of his academic work to donors. This led to him being\u000a      commissioned to do specific pieces of policy-oriented research. Contact\u000a      with other organisations such as Irish Aid and Danish International\u000a      Development Agency within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark came\u000a      later, largely through members of the donor community sharing\u000a      Gainsborough's research with each other. In 2005 Gainsborough formed the\u000a      Bristol-Mekong Project, a research and consultancy arm at the University\u000a      of Bristol designed to make the insights of academic research on Vietnam\u000a      available to practitioners (www.bristol.ac.uk\/spais\/research\/bristol-mekong\/).\u000a      In 2006 Gainsborough was commissioned by Transparency International to\u000a      write its National Integrity Systems report on Vietnam. In 2007\u000a      Gainsborough produced a report for DfID on governance reform options for\u000a      Vietnam to 2020, addressing, amongst other things, donor engagement with\u000a      civil society. Gainsborough is in regular demand as a consultant for the\u000a      international donor community in Vietnam. Donors cite his work and say\u000a      that his work has been influential in their thinking and practice. In 2008\u000a      Gainsborough was commissioned by UNDP to lead a research team looking at\u000a      corruption, public administration reform and development in Vietnam.\u000a      Again, all this activity contributed to Gainsborough's research [1] [2]\u000a      being picked up by the donor community, contributing to the impact\u000a      indicated below.\u000a    Impact 2008 &#8212; end July 2013\u000a    The impact of Gainsborough's research can be divided into two types:\u000a      changes to donor thinking and changes to the design of governance\u000a      programmes.\u000a    (a) Changes to thinking: During 2008-13 Gainsborough's research\u000a      has been an important influence on the way in which the international\u000a      donor community thinks about reform in Vietnam, and specifically the\u000a      political context in which it is operating. The UNDP has said that\u000a      Gainsborough's work `provides clues on what issues to look at' when\u000a      discussing issues with policy makers [4] [b]. AusAid and UNDP have\u000a      highlighted how Gainsborough's work on corruption has been helpful in\u000a      understanding the Vietnamese political system on its own terms [f] [b].\u000a      Irish Aid has been influenced by the work Gainsborough conducted for DfID\u000a      on civil society. Specifically, Gainsborough's research has had an impact\u000a      on Irish Aid's understanding of the links between the state and economic\u000a      private sector type activity in Vietnam. In particular, Gainsborough\u000a      provided guidance in 2009 concerning how to engage the Communist Party.\u000a      Reports by Gainsborough based on his research [1] [2] [3] were cited by\u000a      the World Bank in its Modern Institutions, in its joint donor\u000a      analysis on Vietnam published in 2009 [a] and he was one of the four peer\u000a      reviewers of the document.\u000a    These changes in thinking have also occurred in the news media coverage\u000a      of these issues, attributed directly to the work of Gainsborough [4]. In\u000a      2010, Ben Bland, Indonesia Correspondent of the Financial Times,\u000a      set out his assessment of the importance of Gainsborough's research [4]:\u000a    Wandering through central Hanoi, where banners bearing Communist Party\u000a      slogans stretch over streets full of jewelry stores, designer clothes\u000a      outlets and fancy restaurants, it's all too easy to buy into the received\u000a      wisdom about how Vietnam got where it is today. This view, which is shared\u000a      by the Communist Party and many international scholars alike, holds that\u000a      in 1986 the government launched a wide-ranging program of market-based\u000a      reforms ... Vietnam was thus turned from an isolated, poverty-stricken\u000a      nation into a bustling, middle-income country. Or so the argument goes.\u000a      However, a new and important addition to the rather limited literature on\u000a      modern Vietnam seeks to explode this cozy consensus. In his iconoclastic Vietnam:\u000a        Rethinking the State, Martin Gainsborough, a politics lecturer at\u000a      the University of Bristol, in England, argues that any attempt to examine\u000a      Vietnamese politics through the lens of \"reform\" is fundamentally flawed\u000a      [g].\u000a    In 2011, David Brown, a retired US diplomat wrote in Asia Times\u000a        Online and was similarly laudatory about the research [4] and its\u000a      significance:\u000a    Shortly before a party congress, documents that have been prepared for it\u000a      &#8212; in particular a political report and a 10-year socioeconomic strategy &#8212;\u000a      are redrafted, ostensibly to reflect the trend of all the opinions\u000a      expressed up to that point. Academics and diplomats scrutinize them for\u000a      evidence of policy shifts but this is an exercise of dubious utility, as\u000a      Bristol University scholar Martin Gainsborough points out in his\u000a      remarkable new book Vietnam: Rethinking the State. Like party\u000a      platforms in democracies, the political report and the strategy aim to\u000a      appeal to all and offend none &#8212; thus they become thoroughly homogenized in\u000a      the process of drafting by what is, in effect, a committee of the entire\u000a      political elite. [h]\u000a    Gainsborough continues to be a key resource for journalists trying to\u000a      understand events in Vietnam, as can be seen from him being quoted in a\u000a      March 2013 article in The Atlantic that was shared on Facebook 174\u000a      times and on Twitter 195 times [j].\u000a    (b) Changes to the design of governance programmes: Changes to\u000a      donor thinking about Vietnam's politics in light of Gainsborough's\u000a      research have in turn influenced the way donors have designed their\u000a      governance programmes. In 2007-09, AusAID moved from standalone aid\u000a      projects to greater reliance on Vietnamese government systems to deliver\u000a      their programmes (an approach which continues to this day). Gainsborough's\u000a      research, AusAID said, was very helpful in thinking through the risks\u000a      associated with the changes and how they could be managed [f]. AusAID\u000a      described how Gainsborough's work, alongside other influences, `helped to\u000a      reshape the way in which Australia undertakes development in Vietnam and\u000a      this has endured today' [f]. In its 2007-10 country strategy for Vietnam,\u000a      Irish Aid introduced a `decentralised civil society fund' and moved to\u000a      `mainstream' governance considerations throughout their programme [d].\u000a      According to Irish Aid, Gainsborough's work was important in shaping and\u000a      justifying this approach. It provided the `robust arguments' needed to\u000a      make the case for a new approach involving `separate financing direct to\u000a      government and the establishment of a decentralised fund which would\u000a      support civil society organisations' [e]. In addition, Gainsborough's\u000a      research on civil society and governance has informed Irish Aid's civil\u000a      society strategy for the period 2011-2015. In 2011, UNDP described\u000a      Gainsborough's work on corruption and public administration reform as\u000a      having had a `positive policy impact' on its work, notably the emphasis it\u000a      now places on transparency in its discussions with the Vietnamese\u000a      government [b]. Furthermore, UNDP highlighted how Gainsborough's insights\u000a      on the enforceability of anti-corruption efforts in Vietnam [4] [5] [6]\u000a      currently inform UNDP's discussions on the amendment of the country's\u000a      anti-corruption laws [b]. Gainsborough's work on Vietnamese institutions,\u000a      especially the importance he places on understanding how institutions are\u000a      perceived at the local level [2], has influenced the way in which the\u000a      World Bank designs its policy interventions. Freedom House described how\u000a      Gainsborough's 2010 Vietnam country report for its Countries at the\u000a        Crossroads publication (http:\/\/www.freedomhouse.org\/report\/freedom-world\/2010\/vietnam)\u000a      had been `disseminated among many of the top policy makers and academics\u000a      who shape development and foreign policy related to Vietnam' [c]. See also\u000a      its 2012 report [i] and its reference to his research [1]. Freedom House\u000a      explained that the report had informed the World Bank's Worldwide\u000a        Governance Indicators (http:\/\/info.worldbank.org\/governance\/wgi\/index.aspx#home).\u000a      The indicators cover six areas which capture the quality of a given\u000a      country's governance (voice and accountability, political stability and\u000a      absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of\u000a      law, and control of corruption). Gainsborough's report included both a\u000a      qualitative analysis and quantitative scores covering these areas, which\u000a      alongside other data was used to inform the indicators. The indicators are\u000a      widely used by governments, civil society, and the private sector.\u000a    The reach and significance of the impact\u000a    The reach of the impact described in this case study is mainly focused on\u000a      Vietnam and the work of the international donor community in that country.\u000a      It has also fed into wider Freedom House and World Bank analysis and some\u000a      of the people Gainsborough has worked with have gone on to hold senior\u000a      posts elsewhere in the aid system. Vietnam is the thirteenth most populous\u000a      country in the world with a population of 90 million. Redesign of donor\u000a      support for Vietnam's governance has been rolled out across the country.\u000a      In terms of the research's significance, Gainsborough's research is one of\u000a      a number of influences on donor thinking and practice. However, his\u000a      research has been acknowledged by donors as having been made a major\u000a      contribution to their understanding of the context in which they are\u000a      operating and their subsequent policy design. The research has also had a\u000a      continuing impact of news media coverage of these issues.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact being described in this case study relates to the influence of\u000a      Professor Martin Gainsborough's research on the international donor\u000a      community's thinking behind and design of governance programmes in Vietnam\u000a      and on understandings of these issues in news media coverage. Donors, in\u000a      particular the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme\u000a      (UNDP), the Australian government aid agency AusAid, and the Irish\u000a      government aid agency Irish Aid acknowledge that Gainsborough's research\u000a      has been a major influence on their understanding of Vietnamese politics\u000a      which in turn has informed how they have designed their policy\u000a      interventions during 2008-13. The research has resulted in greater\u000a      reliance by donors on Vietnamese government systems, new risk mitigation\u000a      measures and moves to `mainstream' governance across a range of aid\u000a      programmes.

First, it downplays areas of continuity in economics and\u000a      politics. Second, it underestimates the extent to which factors other than\u000a      elite-led policy initiatives have affected the direction in which Vietnam\u000a      is travelling. Third, and related to the second point, elites have often\u000a      reacted after the event, moving to formalise spontaneous, `bottom-up'\u000a      initiatives, or experimentation, whether by officials, enterprise\u000a      directors, city dwellers or farmers. Consequently, as Gainsborough has\u000a      argued, a holistic account of the reform years in Vietnam needs to take\u000a      into account the relationships between and relative importance of\u000a      continuity and change; elite and non-elite drivers; and formal policy\u000a      initiatives and informal activity.\u000a    The rise of new state business interests [3] [4] [5] 6]\u000a    Gainsborough's research includes a path-breaking study of politics in\u000a      Vietnam's second city and business centre, Ho Chi Minh City (formerly\u000a      Saigon) in which he challenged orthodox notions of reform associating the\u000a      city with economic liberalisation and the retreat of the state. Instead,\u000a      he documented the rise of `new state business interests' as politicians,\u000a      officials and those with close connections to them took advantage of the\u000a      opportunities for profit which came with marketisation and rearticulation\u000a      to the regional and global economy.\u000a    Patronage has been more important than policy positions [1] [2]\u000a      [3] [4] [6]\u000a    Gainsborough has also conducted research in the capital, Hanoi, and in a\u000a      number of northern and southern provinces. As part of this work he\u000a      explored related topics such as enterprise reform, local politics and\u000a      corruption as well as the role of key institutions such as the Communist\u000a      Party, parliament and civil society. It led to his conclusion that\u000a      patronage has been more important than policy positions in explaining the\u000a      dynamics of the `reform' process. He shows that orthodox analysis is too\u000a      quick to explain the dynamics of the `reform' process as an expression of\u000a      policy agreements and disputes. He developed a patronage approach to\u000a      thinking about politics in Vietnam, emphasising the importance of\u000a      political connections and relationships, and the close connection which\u000a      exists in people's minds between holding public office and private gain,\u000a      over and above disputes over rival policy positions, as a determinant of\u000a      outcomes. Gainsborough is uniquely associated with this position and, as\u000a      his research has emphasised, being alert to these characteristics is\u000a      crucial for any analysis of the likely effects of donor initiatives.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40298","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2275384","Name":"Liberia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research has had impact in three main ways:\u000d\u000a    First, the research has played a role in framing policy and setting\u000d\u000a        the operational agenda for security sector reform [1] [2] [8]. SSR\u000d\u000a      has come to be an important policy tool used by a variety of international\u000d\u000a      organisations and western nations in conflict, post-conflict and\u000d\u000a      authoritarian environments. It has been particularly prominent in the\u000d\u000a      western Balkans, sub-Saharan Africa, Iraq, Afghanistan, and more recently\u000d\u000a      the countries of the `Arab Spring'. The UK Department for International\u000d\u000a      Development (DfID) and Ministry of Defence (MoD), NATO (including the\u000d\u000a      International Security Assistance Force, ISAF), EU and other national\u000d\u000a      governments all have formal SSR assistance programmes. Increasingly, SSR\u000d\u000a      has gained prominence in US policy too, both in Iraq and Afghanistan, but\u000d\u000a      also more widely through a new programme of the US Institute for Peace\u000d\u000a      (USIP). The impact of the research is apparent in the policy frameworks\u000d\u000a      used by international and local actors in implementing SSR initiatives in\u000d\u000a      practice, which apply explicitly or implicitly the first and second\u000d\u000a        generation SSR framework developed in the research [1] [2] [8]. The\u000d\u000a      UN Development Programme's 2002 Human Development Report, which\u000d\u000a      first brought SSR issues onto the UN agenda (where they remain) drew on\u000d\u000a      and cited Edmunds' work (pp. 91-92). Currently, the most influential\u000d\u000a      framing documents in this area are the 2007 and 2008 OECD (Organisation\u000d\u000a      for Economic Cooperation and Development) DAC (Development Assistance\u000d\u000a        Co-operation Directorate) Handbooks on SSR. These also draw on and\u000d\u000a      cite and Edmunds' work on first and second generation SSR [1] [2]\u000d\u000a      [8], including civilian capacity building in SSR in distinguishing between\u000d\u000a      executive control, parliamentary oversight and civil society oversight and\u000d\u000a      on the balance (and tensions) between effectiveness, oversight and\u000d\u000a      efficiency in the security sector [h]. Since then, the research has\u000d\u000a      informed many major contemporary SSR initiatives, shaping legislative,\u000d\u000a      institutional and organisation reforms in many post-conflict and\u000d\u000a      post-authoritarian societies. It has benefited international SSR\u000d\u000a      practitioners, and contributed to increasing inclusion of SSR capacity\u000d\u000a      building across the globe [h] [j].\u000d\u000a    The themes developed in the research are apparent in the SSR doctrine of\u000d\u000a      a range of different organisations and actors, including the UN, OECD, EU,\u000d\u000a      NATO's Partnership for Peace and ISAF, the Geneva Centre for the\u000d\u000a      Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF) and national governments such as\u000d\u000a      that of the UK [see, for example, j]. These initiatives all employ\u000d\u000a      concepts and formulations developed in Edmunds' work, including first\u000d\u000a        and second generation SSR issues and the normative nature of the\u000d\u000a        reform process [1] [2] [4] [7] [8] [9]. Indeed, most international\u000d\u000a      SSR initiatives now explicitly recognise the importance of securing `local\u000d\u000a      ownership' if they are to be successful, and the need to tailor reform\u000d\u000a      programmes to local context [h, esp. Section 5; j, pp. 3, 11, 13, 19].\u000d\u000a      Edmunds has advised the USIP (on lessons from postcommunist Europe for SSR\u000d\u000a      in the MENA region, with an impact on USIP SSR training programmes in\u000d\u000a      those countries), the Folke Bernadotte Academy of the Swedish Foreign\u000d\u000a      Ministry (as a member of the SSR working group feeding into the\u000d\u000a      Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee for Swedish government SSR\u000d\u000a      initiatives, including training and capacity-building programmes in\u000d\u000a      Afghanistan, DRC, Liberia and elsewhere), and the Geneva Centre for the\u000d\u000a      Democratic Control of Armed Forces (on first and second Generation SSR,\u000d\u000a      providing training programmes and advice for policy makers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners worldwide). Edmunds was invited to be one of two academic\u000d\u000a      instructors for an SSR training course for Afghan parliamentarians,\u000d\u000a      civil-servants, police and armed forces, run by NATO in February 2013. He\u000d\u000a      is author of the `security sector reform' chapter in the Routledge Handbook\u000d\u000a        of Civil- Military Relations (2012), a `primer' aimed at introducing\u000d\u000a      policy makers and practitioners to the key principles of SSR. The research\u000d\u000a      has also formed the main conceptual basis for a major project on internal\u000d\u000a      roles for European Armed Forces for DCAF, which has run from 2010 to date\u000d\u000a      [c]. The impact of the work can be seen in the regulatory frameworks for\u000d\u000a      civil-security sector relations developed in countries undergoing SSR, in\u000d\u000a      legislation governing parliamentary oversight of the military, police and\u000d\u000a      intelligence agencies, and in SSR training programmes which emphasise the\u000d\u000a      engagement of civilian as well as security sector personnel.\u000d\u000a    Second, the research has had a direct influence on the substance of\u000d\u000a        security and defence reforms in parts of the post-communist and western\u000d\u000a        Balkan regions. The framework developed in Edmunds 2004, 2007 and\u000d\u000a      2008 [1] [2] [4] continues to inform the substance of defence reviews in\u000d\u000a      many of these countries and in Serbia particularly [f]. This is especially\u000d\u000a      the case in terms of the way in which these documents have drawn (either\u000d\u000a      implicitly or explicitly) on the first and second generation framework\u000d\u000a      in distinguishing between civilian and democratic control of armed forces,\u000d\u000a      and structured their discussions and arrangements for civil-military\u000d\u000a      relations on this basis. The research has benefited Ministries of Defence,\u000d\u000a      armed forces and security sector reform practitioners in postcommunist\u000d\u000a      Europe and the Western Balkans. It has contributed to strengthened\u000d\u000a      democratic control of the armed forces in these countries, including the\u000d\u000a      engagement of civil society actors in arrangements for oversight and\u000d\u000a      civil-military relations. It has also helped shape the frameworks used to\u000d\u000a      define expected outcomes and evaluate such reforms as they have taken\u000d\u000a      place [a]. The impact of the research has been explicitly recognised by\u000d\u000a      defence policy makers in the region [a] and has led to Edmunds'\u000d\u000a      appointment to the Advisory Board of the Belgrade Centre for Security\u000d\u000a      Policy, a local expert group with a direct role in drafting and reviewing\u000d\u000a      Serbian defence and security legislation.\u000d\u000a    Finally, the research has had a significant impact on the evolution of\u000d\u000a        British defence policy and armed forces since 2006. On publication,\u000d\u000a      Edmunds and Forster 2007 [3], which applied lessons from Edmunds' research\u000d\u000a      on SSR to the UK defence reform process, received widespread attention and\u000d\u000a      analysis in all major UK newspapers and media outlets and led to questions\u000d\u000a      in both Houses of Parliament. It is widely viewed as providing the first\u000d\u000a      systematic analysis of the structural tensions within British defence and\u000d\u000a      civil-military relations and has been called `the single most important\u000d\u000a      think tank publication on defence' [i]. The arguments of the paper &#8212;\u000d\u000a      particularly with regard to the discrepancy between ambitious policy goals\u000d\u000a      and procurement objectives and the practical constraints of operations and\u000d\u000a      defence planning, as well as the changing relationship of soldier to the\u000d\u000a      armed forces and military covenant; all of which are manifestations of the\u000d\u000a      `local ownership' critique developed in [1] [2] [4] [7] [8] [9] &#8212;\u000d\u000a      set the agenda for a subsequent proliferation of academic and policy work\u000d\u000a      in this area [g]. Edmunds 2010 [5] &#8212; drafts of which were circulated in\u000d\u000a      policy-making circles in Whitehall &#8212; developed these themes and coalesced\u000d\u000a      the argument in terms which were closely reflected in the government's\u000d\u000a      defence green paper of 2010 [e, pp. 12-16] and subsequently in the\u000d\u000a      Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) of the same year. This was\u000d\u000a      the first document of its type for many years to take seriously the gap\u000d\u000a      between defence policy commitments and available resources, reflecting one\u000d\u000a      of the key finding of Edmunds' research. The research at [3] called for a\u000d\u000a      wholesale review of the UK defence establishment and MoD, a call that was\u000d\u000a      finally recognised in the Levene Report on Defence Reform of 2011.\u000d\u000a      The formalisation of an armed forces covenant was adopted in the\u000d\u000a      Conservative Party's 2010 General Election manifesto and passed into\u000d\u000a      legislation in 2011, with direct impact on the level of support offered to\u000d\u000a      armed forces personnel and their families [d].\u000d\u000a    Edmunds 2012 [6] has been included on the UK Chief of the Defence Staff's\u000d\u000a      `Recommended Reading List' [b], indicating the purchase of the research\u000d\u000a      amongst strategic planners at the highest level of the MoD and armed\u000d\u000a      forces. The research [3] [5] [6] has been included on the curriculum for\u000d\u000a      the Advanced Command and Staff Course MA programme at the UK Joint\u000d\u000a      Services Command and Staff College (JSCSC), the most important UK\u000d\u000a      educational programme for military officers preparing for senior command.\u000d\u000a      Edmunds is a member of working groups that are shaping aspects of UK and\u000d\u000a      NATO defence transformation [10]. These include the UK MoD's Defence\u000d\u000a      Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) working group on strategic\u000d\u000a      futures, which is developing new strategic planning methodologies to be\u000d\u000a      used in the forthcoming UK National Security Strategy and SDSR of 2015;\u000d\u000a      and a NATO working group on developing common professional military\u000d\u000a      education standards across the Alliance (having been nominated to join the\u000d\u000a      group by the Director of the UK Defence Academy and the Commandant of the\u000d\u000a      Joint Services Command and Staff College).

First, it has played a role in framing policy and setting the\u000d\u000a      operational agenda for security sector reform (SSR) programmes by national\u000d\u000a      governments and international organisations. Second, the research has had\u000d\u000a      a direct influence on the substance of security and defence reforms in\u000d\u000a      parts of the post-communist and western Balkan regions, particularly in\u000d\u000a      relation to the consolidation of democratic control over the security\u000d\u000a      sector. Finally, it has had an impact on the evolution of British defence\u000d\u000a      policy and armed forces since 2007, and on the debate leading up to the\u000d\u000a      introduction of a new Armed Forces Covenant in May 2011. The research\u000d\u000a      addresses change and transformation in military, police and intelligence\u000d\u000a      agencies through the development and evolution of the concept of SSR. In\u000d\u000a      so doing, it examines how security actors can both threaten and facilitate\u000d\u000a      democratisation and human security goals in post-authoritarian and\u000d\u000a      post-conflict societies, and the manner in which these issues can be\u000d\u000a      addressed through international policy. It also `reverse engineers' the\u000d\u000a      questions and lessons of SSR to interrogate wider challenges of defence\u000d\u000a      transformation and civil-military relations in western democracies, and\u000d\u000a      particularly the UK.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Bristol\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2660646","Name":"Genève"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Outputs\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Edmunds, T.

Security\u000d\u000a      sector reform is now widely employed by development and security actors in\u000d\u000a      a range of contemporary conflict, post-conflict and post-authoritarian\u000d\u000a      environments, from the Balkans to Afghanistan to Sub-Saharan Africa. The\u000d\u000a      research applies intellectual rigour and insights from the civil-military\u000d\u000a      relations field to this area [1] [2] [4] [7] [8] [9]. It is also `reverse\u000d\u000a      engineers' the questions posed by SSR to interrogate wider challenges of\u000d\u000a      defence transformation and civil- military relations in western\u000d\u000a      democracies, and particularly the UK [3] [5] [6] [10].\u000d\u000a    From civilian control to democratic control: reframing civil-military\u000d\u000a        relations. Edmunds' research was the first to elucidate a clear\u000d\u000a      conceptual distinction between civilian control and democratic control of\u000d\u000a      the armed forces and between `first' and `second generation'\u000d\u000a      civil-military relations (and SSR) [1] [2] [4] [7] [8] [9]: this approach\u000d\u000a      is now widely used amongst practitioners in the field. It argues that\u000d\u000a      democratisation in the security sector is not captured well by notions of\u000d\u000a      `civilian control' of the military, but that a wider conception of\u000d\u000a      democratic governance of the security sector is required. This\u000d\u000a      incorporates not simply formal, institutional and legalistic mechanisms of\u000d\u000a      civilian supremacy over the military and security sector (that is `first\u000d\u000a      generation' SSR) but also the development of capacities in other areas,\u000d\u000a      including the civilian bureaucracy, parliament and civil-society, which\u000d\u000a      enable oversight, transparency and accountability of the security sector\u000d\u000a      to become meaningful (`second generation' SSR). The research thus\u000d\u000a      emphasises the importance of civilian capacities in SSR as much as\u000d\u000a      organisational change in the security sector itself or simple legislative\u000d\u000a      change, noting the importance of effectiveness and efficiency of\u000d\u000a      institutions if oversight and transparency are to function in practice.\u000d\u000a      This work was initially developed with Cottey (Cork) and Forster\u000d\u000a      (Nottingham, King's, Bristol) between 1999-2004 (Edmunds as second author)\u000d\u000a      but mainly in Edmunds' further work at Bristol from 2003 onwards.\u000d\u000a    From neutral and generic to normative and contextual: redesigning\u000d\u000a        security sector reform. The research also interrogates the empirical\u000d\u000a      practice of security sector reform and civil-military relations through\u000d\u000a      studies of postcommunist Europe and the Western Balkans [1] [2] [4] [7]\u000d\u000a      [8] [9]. Here it emphasises the normative nature of the security sector\u000d\u000a      reform project, in contrast to some policy literature which presents SSR\u000d\u000a      as a neutral, technocratic process of organisational betterment. In so\u000d\u000a      doing, it highlights the ways in which externally derived, often generic,\u000d\u000a      models of reform can be inappropriate to local political, institutional\u000d\u000a      and society circumstances, leading to policy failure. It captures the\u000d\u000a      manner in which local actors can circumvent or co-opt external policy\u000d\u000a      prescription through informal practices and institutions, which exist\u000d\u000a      alongside their formal counterparts. The main research on this issue took\u000d\u000a      place in 2002-09 and is ongoing.\u000d\u000a    From static and national to transformative and international: a\u000d\u000a        critical approach to military transformation. Finally, the research\u000d\u000a      applies insights from Edmunds' work on SSR [1] [2] [4] [7] [8] [9] to\u000d\u000a      examine how organisational responses to new security challenges in western\u000d\u000a      democracies are shaped through the interplay of international norms and\u000d\u000a      domestic social, political and institutional circumstances. It focuses on\u000d\u000a      the changing role of European armed forces, with an emphasis on the UK\u000d\u000a      case [3] [5] [6] [10]. It argues that the demands of the internationalised\u000d\u000a      military transformation agenda, adopted by European countries including\u000d\u000a      the UK and reflected in ambitious defence policy goals, operational\u000d\u000a      deployments and military procurement objectives, sit increasingly uneasily\u000d\u000a      with domestic political circumstance, institutional interests and economic\u000d\u000a      constraints. In the UK case (work developed initially with Forster with\u000d\u000a      Edmunds as project lead and lead author), it argues that a substantive\u000d\u000a      revision in the underlying assumptions of British defence policy and\u000d\u000a      strategy making has become necessary. It contends that such debates cannot\u000d\u000a      be divorced from the social context in which they take place and has\u000d\u000a      argued for a renewed `military covenant' to underpin British\u000d\u000a      civil-military relations.

From 1985-1989, he was Oxfam's Country\u000d\u000a      Representative in Sudan,\u000d\u000a      responsible for managing under challenging conditions what was, at the\u000d\u000a      time, its largest overseas\u000d\u000a      humanitarian and development programme. In 1991 Duffield was commissioned\u000d\u000a      to write an\u000d\u000a      internal agency report, Oxfam's Emergency Response to the Gulf War.\u000d\u000a      In 1993 Norwegian\u000d\u000a      Church Aid appointed Duffield PI on a project investigating humanitarian\u000d\u000a      intervention in Ethiopia\u000d\u000a      and Eritrea. In 1994 he produced a report for the United Nations\u000d\u000a      Children's Fund on Complex\u000d\u000a        Political Emergencies in Angola and Bosnia. In 1994-95 Duffield was\u000d\u000a      appointed Team Leader by\u000d\u000a      the Catholic Association for Development to evaluate the Sudan\u000d\u000a        Emergency Operations\u000d\u000a        Consortium. In 1995-96 he was commissioned by the United Nations\u000d\u000a      Department of Humanitarian\u000d\u000a      Affairs to coordinate the Evaluation of the UN's Operation Lifeline\u000d\u000a        Sudan. In 1996 the Swedish\u000d\u000a      International Development Co-operation Agency employed Duffield to work on\u000d\u000a      its Evaluation of\u000d\u000a        Social Reconstruction in Croatia and Bosnia. In 1998 DfID appointed\u000d\u000a      him to lead an evaluation\u000d\u000a      team on the DfID Contribution to Poverty Reduction in Mozambique.\u000d\u000a      In 1999-2000 he was Team\u000d\u000a      Leader (North Sudan) on the Evaluation of European Commission\u000d\u000a        Humanitarian Office\u000d\u000a        Assistance to Sudan. In 2001 he led a research team to evaluate the\u000d\u000a      UN's Strategic Framework\u000d\u000a      for Afghanistan. Thus, over nearly two decades Duffield had extensive\u000d\u000a      exposure to humanitarian\u000d\u000a      and aid agencies and donor governments, allowing him to develop formal and\u000d\u000a      informal ties with a\u000d\u000a      wide range of key actors. This close, sustained involvement with diverse\u000d\u000a      agencies, issues and\u000d\u000a      crises brought the merging of development and security to his attention.\u000d\u000a    Impact 2008-13\u000d\u000a    The thinking developed in Duffield's research [1] was brought to bear on\u000d\u000a      two UN-funded\u000d\u000a      missions [7] [8] at the start of this period which in turn led to a\u000d\u000a      further research output [2]. In 2007-08\u000d\u000a      he headed a research team examining how development agencies operate in\u000d\u000a      the `difficult\u000d\u000a      environment' of Myanmar and in 2008 he ran the evaluation of UNHCR's\u000d\u000a      reintegration\u000d\u000a      programme in South Sudan and Blue Nile State. Through these engagements\u000d\u000a      two new themes of\u000d\u000a      his work came into focus &#8212; implausible self-reliance and aid\u000d\u000a      bunkerisation. This led directly to\u000d\u000a      Duffield's 2010-13 ESRC-DfID project [9] on achieving aid policy coherence\u000d\u000a      in challenging\u000d\u000a      environments. It was conducted in conjunction with the Overseas\u000d\u000a      Development Institute (ODI)'s\u000d\u000a      Humanitarian Practice Network (HPN) which has members in over 130\u000d\u000a      countries. It also had an\u000d\u000a      International Reference Group (IRG) throughout as a platform for two-way\u000d\u000a      learning. The IRG was\u000d\u000a      exceptionally high level and wide-ranging including the following and\u000d\u000a      their representatives: UN\u000d\u000a      Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; European Inter-agency\u000d\u000a      Security Forum\u000d\u000a      Coordinator; WFP; US Agency for International Development Senior Adviser\u000d\u000a      on Business\u000d\u000a      Transformation and Bureau of Policy Planning and Learning; Senior Advisor,\u000d\u000a      Emergencies,\u000d\u000a      Danish Church Aid; Humanitarian Director, Oxfam; Policy Development and\u000d\u000a      Evaluation Service,\u000d\u000a      UNHCR; US Social Science Research Council; Director, Humanitarian Policy;\u000d\u000a      Save the Children\u000d\u000a      Fund, Somalia; Director, Humanitarian Practice Group, ODI; DfID\u000d\u000a      Stabilisation Unit; Director,\u000d\u000a      Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International; Head of\u000d\u000a      Humanitarian Section, Danish\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Interpeace; Peace Training and Research\u000d\u000a      Organisation, Afghanistan.\u000d\u000a      This degree of buy-in is indicative of the attention paid by top\u000d\u000a      practitioners to his research.\u000d\u000a    The ESRC-DfID project has brought to the attention of practitioners\u000d\u000a      Duffield's two latest\u000d\u000a      themes &#8212; the problems for resilience posed by pervasive risk [5] and the\u000d\u000a      difficulties faced by\u000d\u000a      attempts at the remote management of aid as a response to the risks faced\u000d\u000a      by aid workers [6].\u000d\u000a      They and others are trying to think through its implications. Duffield\u000d\u000a      spoke in March 2010 at a\u000d\u000a      Wilton Park conference supported by the Australian Agency for\u000d\u000a      International Development, Royal\u000d\u000a      Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Swedish International Development\u000d\u000a      Cooperation Agency\u000d\u000a      and Foreign Office with senior figures from the International Security\u000d\u000a      Assistance Force in Kabul,\u000d\u000a      DfID, the UN Mission in Afghanistan and the US Department of Defence.\u000d\u000a      These issues, including\u000d\u000a      explicit reference to Duffield's work, formed part of the discussion of\u000d\u000a      the High Level Expert Forum\u000d\u000a      on Food Security in Protracted Crises at the headquarters of the Food and\u000d\u000a      Agricultural\u000d\u000a      Organisation in Rome on 13-14 September 2012 [j]. In May 2013, Duffield\u000d\u000a      presented at the\u000d\u000a      Danish Institute for International Studies on the rise of humanitarian\u000d\u000a      remote management and the\u000d\u000a      respondent was the Secretary General of the Danish Red Cross\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/subweb.diis.dk\/sw128386.asp).\u000d\u000a    Policymakers and aid workers of many kinds report that Duffield's\u000d\u000a      research has had a\u000d\u000a      major impact on their thinking and practices. An independent consultant\u000d\u000a      advising DfID on conflict\u000d\u000a      analysis and formerly of Oxfam has described how Duffield's groundbreaking\u000d\u000a      work made\u000d\u000a      practitioners aware that aid was being managed from a security\u000d\u000a      perspective. The consultant\u000d\u000a      highlighted how specialists in the field refer to Duffield's work since he\u000d\u000a      is considered one of a\u000d\u000a      small number of key worldwide experts on the relationship between aid and\u000d\u000a      security, and the\u000d\u000a      politicisation of aid more generally [b]. The WFP has highlighted the\u000d\u000a      importance and relevance of\u000d\u000a      Duffield's work on issues related to humanitarian space, in particular the\u000d\u000a      politicisation of aid and\u000d\u000a      the bunkering of the aid industry, and its impact on access and the\u000d\u000a      relationship between aid\u000d\u000a      workers and beneficiaries. The WFP concurs with Duffield's position that\u000d\u000a      practitioners are not as\u000d\u000a      close to the community as they need to be in order to understand\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries' needs.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, the WFP anticipates that Duffield's research on the\u000d\u000a      security\/development nexus and\u000d\u000a      the containment of populations will likely inform future work undertaken\u000d\u000a      by WFP on the complexity\u000d\u000a      of forced migration [b]. Independent Diplomat's Representative in Juba,\u000d\u000a      South Sudan, has\u000d\u000a      highlighted the importance of Duffield's work [4], which he valued enough\u000d\u000a      to disseminate widely to\u000d\u000a      contacts in the aid community and to Government of South Sudan officials.\u000d\u000a      The Juba\u000d\u000a      Representative stated that he delivered a lecture recently at the Danish\u000d\u000a      Defence Academy in\u000d\u000a      which he had cited Duffield extensively [e]. The co-founder of the Enough\u000d\u000a      Project on ending\u000d\u000a      genocide and crimes against humanity in Africa has said that Duffield's\u000d\u000a      work has been central to\u000d\u000a      the NGO's understandings of conflict dynamics. Duffield's search for\u000d\u000a      answers that go beyond\u000d\u000a      conventional explanations has influenced Enough in its endeavour to seek\u000d\u000a      answers to structural\u000d\u000a      causes, rather than simply proximate reasons for conflict [c]. According\u000d\u000a      to the Research Director\u000d\u000a      at M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) `Mark Duffield is one of the most\u000d\u000a      stimulating academics\u000d\u000a      writing on humanitarian practices.

Adopting a\u000d\u000a      qualitative research\u000d\u000a      methodology and working directly in the field, Duffield's driving concern\u000d\u000a      has been to understand\u000d\u000a      the nature and implications of Western humanitarian and development\u000d\u000a      interventionism in the post-Cold\u000d\u000a      War era, a theme explored in his 2001 book Global Governance and the\u000d\u000a        New Wars: the\u000d\u000a        Merging of Development and Security (1,876 citations). This seminal\u000d\u000a      contribution opened up what\u000d\u000a      is now an extensive field of reflection on the interconnections between\u000d\u000a      development and security.\u000d\u000a      Duffield then explored the idea of development as a liberal strategisation\u000d\u000a      of power that governs in\u000d\u000a      the name of people, freedom and rights (principally in Duffield 2005 in Conflict,\u000d\u000a        Security and\u000d\u000a        Development: 81 citations).\u000d\u000a    Upon his arrival in Bristol in 2006, Duffield embarked upon the second\u000d\u000a      landmark phase of\u000d\u000a      his research, this time on the emerging international security\u000d\u000a      architecture, which Duffield argues\u000d\u000a      has the development-security merger at its core. This new research enabled\u000d\u000a      a more advanced\u000d\u000a      level of theorisation about development as a relation of security. In\u000d\u000a      these outputs Duffield\u000d\u000a      explored how development functions as a tool of governance, and how\u000d\u000a      conflict, humanitarian\u000d\u000a      crises, poverty and fragile states provide opportunities to deepen this\u000d\u000a      policy framework. This work\u000d\u000a      highlights the risk-averse way that aid agencies approach the management\u000d\u000a      of security in the field\u000d\u000a      and its impact on their ability to fulfil their humanitarian functions.\u000d\u000a      His research bridges the\u000d\u000a      academic and policy worlds, bringing critical theory to bear on current\u000d\u000a      policy debates. Since 2007\u000d\u000a      he has identified the very tight, almost annual, time frames of the twists\u000d\u000a      and turns of global liberal\u000d\u000a      governance as the actors within it re-evaluate and revise their engagement\u000d\u000a      with the global South.\u000d\u000a    The key unfolding themes it has identified are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aUnending war: The merger of development and security has\u000d\u000a        produced unending war to\u000d\u000a        govern the global South [1].\u000d\u000a      \u000aContainment: This unending global civil war is increasingly\u000d\u000a        taking the form of efforts by\u000d\u000a        the global North to prevent the non-insured people of the global South\u000d\u000a        from circulating into the\u000d\u000a        global North, and to prevent them doing so less by intervention than by\u000d\u000a        containment [2] [7] [8].\u000d\u000a      \u000aImplausible self-reliance: The contained peoples of the global\u000d\u000a        South are expected to be\u000d\u000a        self-reliant, even though this self-reliance is implausible and actually\u000d\u000a        reinforces a global life-chance\u000d\u000a        divide [3] [7] [8].\u000d\u000a      \u000aThe bunkerisation of aid: The institutions of the global North\u000d\u000a        tend to assume that, for\u000d\u000a        containment of the global South to function, aid must be delivered but\u000d\u000a        the merging of\u000d\u000a        development and security has resulted in aid workers coming under\u000d\u000a        increasing attack.

This research further\u000d\u000a      helped to generate dialogue.\u000d\u000a    The series of initiatives also assisted in the enhancement of development\u000d\u000a      studies departments in various countries. In the University of Zambia the\u000d\u000a      English language version was used as a textbook for students of\u000d\u000a      development training going into the career of NGO management. In Trnava\u000d\u000a      University the Slovakian version and the links were utilised to justify\u000d\u000a      the establishment of a distinct Development Studies department. In Warsaw,\u000d\u000a      PAH adapted the research to inform policy makers of the importance of\u000d\u000a      practical intervention in cooperation strategies. In Northern Ireland the\u000d\u000a      original research is used as a textbook on modules in Queen's University\u000d\u000a      Belfast, the University of Ulster and St Mary's University College\u000d\u000a      Belfast.

It will continue to be a source of reference\u000a      that we will draw on in\u000a      future training and guidance\" (A).\u000a    [text removed for publication].

For example, he has spoken in recent\u000a      years at the `Australia's\u000a      Strategic Futures' Conference, organised by the Australian Defence Science\u000a      and Technology\u000a      Organisation (subsequently published as 3), at similar events in Canada\u000a      and Turkey, and at the\u000a      International Intelligence Ethics Association (IIEA) conference at\u000a      Nuffield College, Oxford. In 2010,\u000a      Phythian presented his research at a seminar held at the Cabinet Office in\u000a      Whitehall chaired by\u000a      Paul Rimmer. A revised version of his presentation was subsequently\u000a      published (2).\u000a    Phythian was also commissioned to prepare a 6,500-word report on lessons\u000a      from the Scott Inquiry\u000a      into arms-to-Iraq, which was disseminated to defence intelligence staff\u000a      within the Ministry of\u000a      Defence in 2013 (C). He has been interviewed as an expert on the\u000a      ethics-intelligence relationship\u000a      for a report on counter-terrorism and ethics produced by RAND Europe,\u000a      commissioned by the\u000a      Dutch Ministry of Safety and Justice.\u000a    Phythian has also engaged with practitioners by commissioning book\u000a      chapters from serving or\u000a      former intelligence professionals across several edited works published\u000a      during the current REF\u000a      census period. Phythian makes a point of aiming his own published work at\u000a      both academic and\u000a      practitioner-focused audiences. In addition, his published work has been\u000a      reviewed in the CIA's in-house\u000a      journal, Studies in Intelligence.\u000a    Phythian's work has also been used on broader security issues.

Phythian's research into issues\u000a      arising from the\u000a      SDSR underpinned a submission to the House of Commons Defence Committee in\u000a      2012 which\u000a      was cited at various points in its 2013 report into Defence\u000a      Acquisition (D, see paras. 155, 157 and\u000a      191) and informed its key recommendation (D, see paras. 191 and 198, E).\u000a    Phythian has also provided expert opinion for the BBC, and appeared in\u000a      print and broadcast media\u000a      in the UK and internationally, including BBC Radio 4's Correspondent\u000a      programme in 2011 (F).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research has influenced professional standards, guidelines and\u000a      training in intelligence in the\u000a      wake of the intelligence failure that contributed to the 2003 invasion of\u000a      Iraq.

His research at the\u000a      University of Leicester has\u000a      been in the field of intelligence and security; specifically, focusing on\u000a      intelligence failure and the\u000a      analytical traps that can lead to failure (1-4), the question of ethics\u000a      and intelligence (5), and issues\u000a      arising from the SDSR and the defence-intelligence nexus (6, 7).\u000a    His research findings argue for a more nuanced understanding of the\u000a      nature of intelligence `failure',\u000a      particularly in the context of pre-war intelligence into Iraq's weapons of\u000a      mass destruction\u000a      programmes within the US and UK intelligence communities. Simplistic\u000a      notions encourage the\u000a      search for failure at a single point in the intelligence cycle, and the\u000a      assumption that they are mono-causal.\u000a      However, Phythian's analysis of intelligence `failure' suggests that it is\u000a      far more complex\u000a      and the reasons more likely to be multi-causal, overlapping and mutually\u000a      reinforcing (2, 4). It also\u000a      suggests that failure can also have a structural dimension (1) and has\u000a      highlighted the need for a\u000a      more nuanced understanding of the role of policymakers in such `failures'\u000a      and of the meaning and\u000a      likelihood of politicisation as a contributory factor (2, 4).\u000a    Avoidance of failure is closely linked to the question of analytical\u000a      effectiveness. Phythian's\u000a      research has identified approaches for ensuring this effectiveness and\u000a      therefore avoiding analytical\u000a      traps (3). Effective discussion of the relationship between ethics and\u000a      intelligence requires the\u000a      articulation of a framework through which it can be advanced. Research at\u000a      Leicester has focused\u000a      on developing this in a manner that can inform intelligence training,\u000a      engaging in debate with\u000a      intelligence practitioners as part of this process (5). It has identified\u000a      the source of the ethics-intelligence\u000a      tension, and proposed an understanding of the relationship between ethics\u000a      and law in\u000a      this area. It has challenged the wisdom of rooting approaches to\u000a      intelligence ethics in an extension\u000a      of \"just war'' principles (5).\u000a    His research has also provided a critique of the understanding of\u000a      `strategy' underpinning the SDSR\u000a      (6, 7). It has made the case that the SDSR heralds a new form of\u000a      bureaucratic governance in the\u000a      UK (7). It has also highlighted the extent to which the contemporary\u000a      relationship between the\u000a      Ministry of Defence and industry is dysfunctional, arguing that the\u000a      historic link that existed between\u000a      UK defence procurement and UK-based defence manufacturing has now been\u000a      broken and pointing\u000a      to the consequent risks.\u000a    In 2012, the National Academy of Social Sciences made Phythian an\u000a      Academician, a title\u000a      conferred on those who have made a significant contribution to the social\u000a      sciences, in recognition\u000a      of his leading role in establishing a social science framework for the\u000a      study of intelligence.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40445","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2960313","Name":"Luxembourg"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Professor Garner's work has facilitated debate which has effected change\u000a      in key areas of animal welfare, including the controversial uses of wild\u000a      animals in travelling circuses in the UK, and the hunting of whales (A,\u000a      B, C). As a result, Garner has made an influential\u000a      contribution to campaigns for social, economic, political and legal\u000a      change.\u000a    His arguments &#8212; made from both political and ethical standpoints &#8212; have\u000a      been employed by DEFRA in presenting to Parliament its case for an\u000a      outright ban on the use of wild animals in travelling circuses. The\u000a      proposed Wild Animals Circuses Bill, which was published in April 2013 by\u000a      DEFRA, outlaws the use of species not normally domesticated in the UK from\u000a      appearing in travelling circuses after December 2015. DEFRA has also\u000a      introduced a stringent new licensing scheme which is designed to ensure\u000a      the welfare of wild animals in circuses as the bill works its way through\u000a      Parliament.\u000a    DEFRA consulted Garner on the contents of the bill &#8212; in particular the\u000a      question of why it is unacceptable for wild animals to perform in\u000a      travelling circuses but acceptable for them to appear in other\u000a      entertainment spheres such as TV, film and theatre. Upon the Bill's\u000a      publication, DEFRA wrote to Garner to thank him for his contribution to\u000a      some of the work underpinning the justifications for its proposal. (H).\u000a    Based on Garner's study, DEFRA outlined its case to Parliament, saying:\u000a      `The Government does not believe it is appropriate to continue to use wild\u000a      animals in travelling circuses because:\u000a    \u000a      People can still experience the circus without wild animals being part\u000a        of the act.\u000a      Wild animals are just that. They are not naturally suited to\u000a        travelling circuses and may suffer as a result of not being able to\u000a        follow their natural behavioural instincts.\u000a      We should feel duty bound to recognise that wild animals have\u000a        intrinsic value. Therefore we should respect their inherent wildness and\u000a        its implications for their treatment.\u000a      The practice adds nothing to our understanding and conservation of\u000a        wild animals or the natural environment' (I).\u000a    \u000a    Elsewhere in the field of animal protection, Garner's work has impacted\u000a      upon the way in which the global welfare of whales is approached. His\u000a      input contributed to the outcome that the International Whaling Commission\u000a      (IWC) has for the first time recognised that animal welfare is an\u000a      important and relevant consideration to be taken into account in the\u000a      killing of whales, both directly through hunting and indirectly, and\u000a      inadvertently, through other activities such as shipping and fishing. This\u000a      changed conservation policy has led to the improved design of an important\u000a      regulatory machinery for protecting the natural environment.\u000a    Garner was invited to prepare a briefing document on the Ethical Case\u000a      against Whaling which was presented at a two-day workshop convened by the\u000a      WSPA (World Society for the Protection of Animals) and DEFRA (D).\u000a      The workshop's aim was to produce recommendations on the future role of\u000a      animal welfare in the IWC's decision-making structure, with the resulting\u000a      report submitted by the UK delegation to the IWC in 2011. Garner's\u000a      contribution was to provide expert advice on the ethical dimension of\u000a      whaling in general, and a clarification of the meaning of animal welfare\u000a      in particular (E, G).\u000a    At the IWC's 2011 meeting, the UK formed an Intersessional Working Group\u000a      which concluded that animal welfare is relevant across all the IWC's work.\u000a      Drawing on the contents of the Workshop's report, the group reached\u000a      consensus on a series of recommendations, including proposals for two\u000a      animal welfare-focused workshops. At the IWC's meeting in 2012, the UK\u000a      tabled the Intersessional Working Groups' report and recommendations,\u000a      which were subsequently endorsed by consensus by the IWC (F).\u000a    In more general terms, Garner's work has shaped the debate within the\u000a      animal rights movement which has historically coalesced around the\u000a      abolition versus regulation question. Garner's work is cited within the\u000a      movement as the principal academic justification for the latter position,\u000a      thereby challenging established norms, and modes of thought and practice\u000a      within the abolitionist strand of the animal rights movement (a strand\u000a      which has been traditionally dominant). His research has impacted on\u000a      stakeholders at all levels, with his work disseminated in a variety of\u000a      forums including radio interviews, podcasts and newspaper articles. He has\u000a      also given many talks and lectures throughout the world attended by both\u000a      activists and academics. These have included recent keynote lectures to an\u000a      animal rights gathering in Austria (in December 2011), to the\u000a      International Animal Rights Conference in Luxembourg (in September 2012)\u000a      and to a conference organised by the Australian RSPCA in Sydney (October\u000a      2012).\u000a    In addition, Garner has also played an essential role in the creation and\u000a      development of the Centre for Animals and Social Justice (CASJ) &#8212; a third\u000a      sector think tank which was launched in 2011 to focus on academic research\u000a      and advocacy in animal protection public policy. (http:\/\/www.casj.org.uk\/about\/who-we-are\/).\u000a      The CASJ was formed following a number of meetings between academics and\u000a      activists. These included Dan Lyons and Angela Roberts from the\u000a      anti-vivisection group Uncaged, Kim Stallwood, former CEO of the American\u000a      animal rights group PETA, and Alistair Currie, Campaigns Coordinator at\u000a      PETA in the UK. Lyons and Roberts now act as the paid organisers of the\u000a      CASJ and Garner acts as the Chair of the Research Committee.\u000a    The CASJ seeks to build bridges between academia, advocates and policy\u000a      makers. Through Garner, it has funded a series of seminars on animals and\u000a      public policy at the University of Leicester (attended by academics,\u000a      activists and public policy makers) as well as part-funding a PhD student\u000a      in this research area under Garner's supervision (Anne Marie Matarrese who\u000a      began her studies in October 2012). Garner has also contributed to a CASJ\u000a      policy submission to British political parties, and to an RSPCA working\u000a      group on `Animal Welfare in Government'.\u000a    Professor Garner's influence and impact on the CASJ's role is attested to\u000a      by Dan Lyons, its CEO (J). He reports that Garner's research `has\u000a      had a major impact on the debate within the animal protection movement at\u000a      all levels, in particular stimulating a growing recognition of the need to\u000a      move beyond ideal ethical demands towards proposals that take account of\u000a      constraining power structures'.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The use and treatment of animals in the provision of our food, clothing\u000a      and other raw materials, as well as in the areas of medical research,\u000a      sport and entertainment, polarises public opinion and provokes extreme\u000a      views.

The starting point\u000a      for Garner's research is, as one reviewer put it, to `lead the way through\u000a      this labyrinth of moral mazes, political inconsistencies and economic\u000a      sticking points clearly and analytically'.\u000a    This research has been undertaken by Garner primarily since 1995 when he\u000a      joined the University of Leicester, first as a Lecturer and subsequently\u000a      in the role of Reader and latterly Professor.\u000a    In particular, two strands underpin the impact of Garner's research on\u000a      the nature of animal protection as a political issue, and the ethics of\u000a      our use of animals:\u000a    (i) The development of a typology of positions in the animal ethics\u000a      debate and the advocacy of a particular, rights-based, ethic.\u000a    (ii) The advocacy of a particular strategic position known as New\u000a      Welfarism or Animal Protectionism\u000a    In terms of (i) Garner has sought to delineate and explore the\u000a      consequence, for the treatment of animals, of the adoption of different\u000a      positions within the animal ethics debate (1, 2). Of\u000a      particular importance has been the distinction made between animal welfare\u000a      as a scientific endeavour and as an ethic (4, chapter 5). This\u000a      expertise was utilised, for instance, by the DEFRA\/WSPA workshop on Animal\u000a      Welfare and Whaling and by other bodies (see below) who have proffered\u000a      invites to talk at conferences and meetings.\u000a    In terms of (ii) Garner is the leading advocate of a strategic position\u000a      (New Welfarism or Animal Protectionism) which combines a consideration of\u000a      ethics and political possibility (1, 3, 4). It\u000a      seeks to challenge, both strategically and philosophically, the claims of\u000a      the so-called animal rights absolutists who advocate the abolition of\u000a      particular uses of animals on the grounds that to use them, irrespective\u000a      of what is done to them whilst they are being used, is illegitimate\u000a      morally. Animal protectionism, by contrast, argues, strategically, for\u000a      incremental change in pursuit of non-human animal interests. It is a\u000a      position that agrees (with abolitionists) that the animal welfare model of\u000a      animal protection&#8212;whereby animals may be used as food, clothing,\u000a      entertainment and in experiments so long as there is no unnecessary\u000a      suffering&#8212;is flawed ethically. However, it also suggests that the\u000a      incremental approach stressing the need to eradicate unnecessary suffering\u000a      may still have some political mileage.\u000a    Garner argues that the pursuit of better treatment of animals through\u000a      incremental change is consistent with holding an abolitionist ideology,\u000a      and rejects the critics (notably Professor Gary Francione, an American\u000a      legal scholar) who argue that reforms that improve the treatment of\u000a      animals persuade the public that the animals they use are being treated\u000a      kindly, and that continued use is therefore justifiable (3).\u000a    Ethically, Garner argues that both the animal welfare and the\u000a      abolitionist animal rights position are flawed. Rather, an approach that\u000a      is based on the right of animals not to suffer is closer to the correct\u000a      normative position, and this could, possibly, be consistent with the\u000a      continued use of animals as a source of food and as subjects of scientific\u000a      experiments.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40570","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    To date, the research has been used to inform the development of a\u000a      `one-stop-shop' approach to victims' provision; has led to a feasibility\u000a      study of provision of a pension for victims of the Troubles; generated a\u000a      discussion about definitions of injury which is now recognised as an area\u000a      by policy makers and politicians that requires further research and\u000a      consensus building; and has been used by the Campaign for All Injured\u000a      conducted by the WAVE injured group, to advance the cause of all injured\u000a      people.

He has been working with the\u000d\u000a      Forgiveness Project since 2008. This work has led to the development and\u000d\u000a      application of the Forgiveness Toolbox (http:\/\/www.theforgivenesstoolbox.com\/about\/).\u000a      The Forgiveness Project works with victim and perpetrator groups of\u000d\u000a      conflicts across the world. Their main aim is `to provide tools that\u000d\u000a      facilitate conflict resolution and promote behavioural change' (http:\/\/theforgivenessproject.com\/).\u000a      The focus of the Toolbox is to develop `skills [that] aim to enable\u000d\u000a      individuals and groups to re-gain their diminished sense of agency\u000d\u000a      following victimhood experiences.' In terms of reach, this\u000d\u000a      Toolbox is publicly available on the internet and can therefore be\u000d\u000a      utilised by NGOs, groups and individuals in a range of global contexts.It\u000d\u000a      utilises the experiences of victims and perpetrators, who have worked with\u000d\u000a      Noor and the Forgiveness Project. The significance\u000d\u000a      of this work can be seen in terms of how it has filled a demonstrable gap\u000d\u000a      in the necessary practical resources available for those working on the\u000d\u000a      ground, in the field of dealing with the effects of conflict, specifically\u000d\u000a      at the psychological level.\u000d\u000a    The impact has occurred through the process of developing the Toolbox.\u000d\u000a      From the start there has been a strong input from practitioners (The\u000d\u000a      Forgiveness Project), focusing on enhancing and improving effective\u000d\u000a      practice. Noor's research had to respond directly to practitioner\u000d\u000a      needs. Furthermore, victims and perpetrators of violence and conflict were\u000d\u000a      involved at key stages of the design process, and challenged many of the\u000d\u000a      assumptions of the research itself. Thus, participants have engaged with\u000d\u000a      different concepts of victimhood, as can be seen by one participant's\u000d\u000a      testimony: `I can't look at myself as a victim &#8212; it diminishes me as a\u000d\u000a        person.'\u000d\u000a    Before going `live' in July 2013, we put mechanisms in place to monitor\u000d\u000a      downloads and access to the Toolbox, along with practitioners' narrative\u000d\u000a      pertaining to its use. While Noor's work focuses on the\u000d\u000a      psychological responses to violence and conflict, Keil's work is\u000d\u000a      on institutional design in post-conflict societies. These approaches have\u000d\u000a      recently been united in a policy paper, which has been distributed to\u000d\u000a      partner organisations.\u000d\u000a    Keil was commissioned to write a report by the Friedrich Ebert\u000d\u000a      Stiftung, and this has since been published by their office in Bosnia and\u000d\u000a      Herzegovina (in 2011), and has been used to confirm their policy of\u000d\u000a      supporting specific state reforms (http:\/\/www.fes.ba\/publikacije\/2012\/Welfare\/soren.pdf).\u000a      As part of the Foundation's work in Bosnia, they have identified economic\u000d\u000a      stagnation and social instability as key reasons for the on-going\u000d\u000a      political crisis in the country (www.fes.ba). It can be demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      Keil's work has enabled the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung to continue\u000d\u000a      its focus on certain reform initiatives and provided wider information for\u000d\u000a      key stakeholders such as young people, trade unionists and social\u000d\u000a      democratic party members. For another research paper, Keil worked\u000d\u000a      collaboratively on research with a practitioner and former employee of the\u000d\u000a      Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). He has also\u000d\u000a      worked with the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung in Bosnia, for which Keil\u000d\u000a      co-authored a paper on the territorial dimension of the Croat question in\u000d\u000a      Bosnia. This paper has been used to inform policy debates in the country\u000d\u000a      in 2013. In terms of reach, therefore this work has\u000d\u000a      specifically focused on certain societal actors in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\u000d\u000a      While enabling further public debate on fundamental issues of\u000d\u000a      state-building and social policy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, this impact is\u000d\u000a      also significant, because it enables the Friedrich Ebert\u000d\u000a      Stiftung (and other key actors in Bosnia) to apply intellectual knowledge\u000d\u000a      in their practical work.\u000d\u000a    Supporting evidence\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Work with NGOs such as The Forgiveness Project, and The\u000d\u000a          Parenting Circle can be viewed at www.theforgivenessproject.org.uk,\u000d\u000a        and http:\/\/www.theparentscircle.com\/\u000d\u000a        see also the homepage of the Forgiveness Tool Kit:\u000d\u000a          http:\/\/www.theforgivenesstoolbox.com\/resisting-conformity\/\u000a\u000d\u000a      Work with the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The main finding of this article can be summarised by the\u000d\u000a      fact that it demonstrates the limits of ownership in a post-conflict\u000d\u000a      society. By focusing on the role of the OSCE in education policy, the\u000d\u000a      authors show how local elites have permanently failed to implement\u000d\u000a      recommended guidelines and have not been able to fulfil their\u000d\u000a      international obligations. This is explained by a lack of imposition\u000d\u000a      powers for the OSCE and a general lack of consensus on the nature of the\u000d\u000a      state in Bosnia amongst political elites.\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000ad) Noor, M., Shnabel, N., Halabi, S. and Nadler, A.

His most notable achievement in\u000d\u000a      this field is the development and analysis of the concept of Competitive\u000a          Victimhood which has demonstrated how different groups in\u000d\u000a      inter-group conflict claim the label of `victims' (3d). He has evidenced\u000d\u000a      this phenomenon by examining groups that were involved in violence and\u000d\u000a      conflict in Chile, Northern Ireland, Croatia, Israel and Palestine,\u000d\u000a      amongst others (3e,f). This work has been recognised by the American\u000d\u000a      Psychological Association, which awarded Noor an Early Career\u000d\u000a      Award for Peace Psychology in 2010. Dr Keil's research has focused on the\u000d\u000a      relationship between state-building, democratization and transition in\u000d\u000a        post-conflict societies, with a special focus on Bosnia and\u000d\u000a      Herzegovina (3a). His main achievement is to show how important a\u000d\u000a      consensus on the nature of a state is in the process of state-building. He\u000d\u000a      has furthermore demonstrated how the lack of such a consensus can severely\u000d\u000a      influence strategies of democratization and state reconstruction (3b).\u000d\u000a      More recently his work has focused on looking at different policy areas in\u000d\u000a      post-conflict societies (3b-c). Thus, the work points out how the lack of\u000d\u000a      a consensus on the nature of a state can limit post-conflict\u000d\u000a      reconstruction. He has furthermore demonstrated the limits of ownership of\u000d\u000a      local elites in a political environment that is still divided and in which\u000d\u000a      tensions remain high.

This impact has\u000a      also been highly significant in terms of improving practice in PET in the\u000a      UK and in particular, changing PET policy and practice within both initial\u000a      police training and European cybercrime investigation. Through the impact\u000a      of our research at a strategic level (such as the Higher Education Forum\u000a      for Learning and Development in Policing and the European Cybercrime\u000a      Training and Education Group), we have been able to influence the\u000a      direction of debates around issues of professionalization at both UK and\u000a      pan-European levels. At a practitioner-based level, we have been able to\u000a      assess the training requirements and develop the materials needed to\u000a      provide a more coherent and uniform approach to PET and to, subsequently,\u000a      impact on the professional standards of practitioners in this area (see\u000a      3b) above). At the level of reach, this research has impacted on a\u000a      number of groups, agencies and stakeholders across the UK and Europe. The\u000a      reach of our research on initial police training as part of the UK's PET\u000a      is illustrated by a number of examples. Our report for the Higher\u000a      Education Academy ('ASC 547 Higher Education and Policing') has reached\u000a      all higher education providers in England and Wales. At the practitioner\u000a      level, over 70% of the police forces in England and Wales use our Oxford\u000a      University Press publication 'Blackstone's Handbook for Policing Students'\u000a      (see 2b above), authored by UoA staff to support the initial training of\u000a      police officers (to date, over 32,000 copies of the textbook have been\u000a      sold). In terms of the reach of our research into international cybercrime\u000a      investigation training, 200 practitioners from more than 30 European\u000a      countries have benefitted by undertaking 14 innovative and high quality\u000a      cybercrime investigation training courses, designed by UoA staff and\u000a      others. Practitioners were drawn from European law enforcement agencies\u000a      (for example, the national German police), and during the span of the\u000a      projects included investigators from every national state in the European\u000a      Union. The courses have also been delivered beyond Europe (particularly\u000a      Africa and the Middle East) by international organisations such as the\u000a      Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (the OSCE), extending\u000a      the reach of our research yet further. Most recently, the reach of the\u000a      impact of our cybersecurity research can be seen in the establishment of\u000a      England's new Cybercrime Centre of Excellence Network for Training,\u000a      Research and Education. Our partners in this project are the College of\u000a      Policing; ACPO e-Crime Training, the PcEU; nine UK universities and four\u000a      commercial companies.\u000a    At the level of significance, the impact of our PET\u000a      research can be seen in a number of arenas. First, there is our\u000a      significant engagement with debates around initial police training in the\u000a      UK. In 2012 we were invited to contribute to the Independent Commission on\u000a      Policing, chaired by Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington and this has resulted\u000a      in a chapter on the future of initial police training and education in the\u000a      2013 Routledge publication (see 2a above). Earlier staff within the UoA\u000a      authoritatively set out the current and likely future direction of initial\u000a      police training for the Higher Education Academy. Finally, written\u000a      feedback to the publisher on the impact of our Blackstone's publication\u000a      from police trainers in the UK is overwhelmingly positive, one remarking\u000a      in 2013 that the Handbook 'makes a unique contribution to the training of\u000a      policing students' and others noting that it had become the de facto\u000a      textbook for the profession.\u000a    Our research and pedagogic evaluations within cybercrime investigation\u000a      training were central to the development of European-wide training courses\u000a      that meet urgent cybercrime investigation needs. A good example of this is\u000a      the new Mac Forensics course designed as part of an ISEC project that our\u000a      research supported. Up to this point there was no Mac operating system\u000a      forensics course that was common to law enforcement agencies in Europe.\u000a    UoA staff are taking a lead on the development of the EU's joined-up\u000a      response to cybercrime by making a comprehensive and up to date training\u000a      package (developed with experts from throughout the EU) more attractive to\u000a      member states than their own often uncoordinated efforts. By\u000a      internationalising the delivery of these courses we also provide the\u000a      training within an environment predicated upon cross-border relationships.\u000a    Within the UK, the research of UoA staff has influenced a number of\u000a      national policy developments. A notable example is the new (March 2012)\u000a      Association of Chief Police Officer (ACPO) Good Practice guidelines for\u000a      Digital Evidence. UoA staff were also instrumental in establishing the\u000a      British Computer Society Cybercrime Forensics Specialist Group which, to\u000a      date, has over 1450 members in 44 countries.\u000a    Further tangible evidence of the significance of the research includes\u000a      the establishment of the European Cybercrime Training and Education Group\u000a      (ECTEG) based with Europol in Den Haag. When the new European Cybercrime\u000a      Centre (EC3) was being established consultations were held with ECTEG\u000a      concerning the new agencies remit.\u000a    The significance of our impact is on-going, as demonstrated by a number\u000a      of research projects in cybersecurity that have since started and that\u000a      have arisen from the partnership developed with Europol and others.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes the significant impact on police education and\u000a      training in Europe initiated by applied research undertaken by UoA staff.\u000a      The impact has been felt most keenly in the professionalisation of initial\u000a        police training in the UK and through an increased capability of law\u000a      enforcement agencies to maintain European cyber-security, impacts\u000a      firmly positioned within the UoA theme of Conflict and Security. Further,\u000a      it is argued that the impact of our research can be contextualised within\u000a      a wider criminal justice sector strategic response to the increasing\u000a      number of dynamic threats to the security of Europe.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Canterbury Christ Church University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Canterbury Christ Church University","InstitutionName":"Canterbury Christ Church University","PeerGroup":"E","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10001143}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2747373","Name":"Den Haag"}],"References":"\u000a    Three of these sources demonstrate our impact on initial police training\u000a      and education in the UK:\u000a    \u000aa) Bryant, R., Cockcroft, T., Tong, S. &amp; Wood, D.

The paper\u000a      set out the arguments for higher education engagement with the\u000a      professionalisation of initial police training in the UK. This article\u000a      highlights the trend, evident since the 1970s, of British universities\u000a      partnering police services in the design and delivery of educational\u000a      programmes for police officers. A variety of curricula and new\u000a      partnerships have evolved but there is little evidence of the contribution\u000a      of these developments or whether these `new' approaches differ\u000a      significantly from traditional training regimes.

The book also laid the\u000a      foundations for a new publication by UoA staff (IPolicing Digital\u000a        Crime, published in January 2014 by Ashgare Publishing). Research\u000a      conducted for the first publication included not only an extensive\u000a      literature review but also semi-structured interviews with key\u000a      practitioners in the field. Particularly important are chapter 1 ('The\u000a      challenge of digital crime') which sets out the theoretical background to\u000a      cyber-security and chapter 12 ('Criminological and Motivational\u000a      Perspectives') which synthesises criminological and digital investigative\u000a      theory. The book describes a set of findings that demonstrate that digital\u000a      crime presents unique challenges to law enforcement agencies. These\u000a      challenges are best met with comprehensive PET, located firmly within an\u000a      evidence-based approach to investigative enquiry.\u000a    \u000a\u000ad) Bryant, R., Cockcroft, T. and Dileone, N.

In terms of assessment, the evaluation drew\u000a      attention to a number of challenges.

Likewise, cyber-security has, according to stakeholder agencies (such\u000a      as the EU and NATO), become a national and international security and\u000a      governance challenge, not only for law enforcement agencies but also in a\u000a      wider political sense. UoA staff research has led to a more comprehensive,\u000a      robust and evidence-grounded basis to PET. The research derived its\u000a      methodology from the `participatory action research' tradition, noted for\u000a      its `practical' positioning in respect of organisational development, but\u000a      our research was also situated within the approach articulated by Atweh et\u000a      al. (1998) and others, where action research is used to develop innovation\u000a      in education and training. Accordingly, the research process was a\u000a      reflexive one, involving police trainers, academics and other key\u000a      practitioners in the process of generating research outcomes.\u000a    The underpinning research was undertaken by UoA researchers drawn from\u000a      the Faculty of Social and Applied Sciences, and particularly from the\u000a      Department of Law and Criminal Justice (DLCJ) and the Department of\u000a      Computing (DC). Lead academics were Professor Robin Bryant (at CCCU since\u000a      1995), and Dr Tom Cockcroft (at CCCU since 2004), together with other\u000a      researchers from the two departments.\u000a    The underpinning research generated a number of important findings.\u000a    First, the professionalization of policing requires a validated, verified\u000a      but dynamic corpus of knowledge, capable of adapting to a rapidly changing\u000a      global world. Hence it is important to design coherent PET curricula that\u000a      incorporate abstract, conceptual learning alongside practical skills,\u000a      abilities and attributes (see 3a).\u000a    Second, this corpus of knowledge can only be derived through the\u000a      engagement of the profession itself. This must be from a position of\u000a      informed `critical friendship' with the academic community. This has to be\u000a      in line with developing mechanisms for ensuring that appropriate ethical\u000a      and professional standards are incorporated into PET programmes (see 3b\u000a      and c).\u000a    Third, assessment and accreditation remain key issues for PET, ones that\u000a      are yet to be fully reconciled with a professional status (see 3e).\u000a    Fourth, the pedagogic requirements to support the professionalisation of\u000a      PET (including specialist roles such as `cybercrime investigator') have\u000a      yet to be adequately delineated. There are difficulties when the two\u000a      cultures of higher education and police training converge. These range\u000a      from the level of the epistemic to the practicalities of conditions of\u000a      service (see 3 d, e and f).\u000a    Fifth, a robust PET is one of the essential requirements of countering\u000a      emerging threats to security in Europe. However, nationally there is some\u000a      inconsistency regarding PET. Links between the police and higher education\u000a      have developed primarily on a local bilateral basis, resulting in a\u000a      variety of approaches for PET (see 3 a).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40803","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3573345","Name":"Bermuda"},{"GeoNamesId":"3658394","Name":"Ecuador"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    (i) Corruption and reform in the Turks and Caicos Islands.\u000d\u000a    As Clegg was undertaking research on the UKOTs in 2007\/2008, a\u000d\u000a      significant corruption scandal was revealed in the Turks and Caicos\u000d\u000a      islands involving the prime minister, several of his ministerial\u000d\u000a      colleagues, and a number of other private individuals. Local government\u000d\u000a      was suspended by the UK and direct rule from London was imposed.\u000d\u000a      Subsequently a process of constitutional, political and economic reform\u000d\u000a      was undertaken to address the poor governance in the TCI. Being such an\u000d\u000a      important development, Clegg's research focused on why significant\u000d\u000a      problems in governance had developed and what could be done to address\u000d\u000a      them. His research became known in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office [2]\u000d\u000a      and Transparency International [1], and he was asked to contribute to\u000d\u000a      various review processes. These included presenting a paper to the\u000d\u000a      Overseas Territories Forum at the FCO on 8 December 2009; contributing to\u000d\u000a      the Transparency International Report published in 2011; supplying on\u000d\u000a      demand several of his publications on the TCI to FCO officials (see Clegg\u000d\u000a      2012, Clegg &amp; Gold 2011, and Clegg &amp; Pantojas-Garcia 2009); and\u000d\u000a      participating in an FCO- sponsored meeting on the TCI on 27 January 2012.\u000d\u000a      Through these avenues he has worked closely with FCO officials to ensure\u000d\u000a      balanced debate and helped to develop a better understanding of some of\u000d\u000a      the underlying issues relating to the Territories, e.g. why the TCI is\u000d\u000a      particularly prone to sub-standard governance. His work is also\u000d\u000a      recommended to those diplomats being posted to the Territories in order to\u000d\u000a      provide them with an insight into the political and economic issues facing\u000d\u000a      the Territories.\u000d\u000a    (ii) Non-self-governing territories and their quest for\u000d\u000a        decolonisation.\u000d\u000a    As a result of Clegg's research, he was invited to attend a United\u000d\u000a      Nations Caribbean regional seminar on the implementation of the Third\u000d\u000a      International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: Goals and\u000d\u000a      Expected Accomplishments, Kingstown, St Vincent and the Grenadines, 31\u000d\u000a      May-2 June 2011. (An invitation was made to attend the subsequent\u000d\u000a      Caribbean regional seminar in Quito, Ecuador in May 2013.) Such meetings,\u000d\u000a      involving UN members and policy experts, are organised to further the\u000d\u000a      process of decolonisation in seventeen so-called non-self-governing\u000d\u000a      territories. He had a further separate meeting with UN officials in New\u000d\u000a      York in August 2011 [3]. His interventions have contributed to the\u000d\u000a      decolonisation debate and influenced discussion at the regional seminars.\u000d\u000a      For example, Clegg suggested \"holding of formal and\/or informal regular\u000d\u000a      meetings involving the Territories, the Administering Powers and the UN\",\u000d\u000a      and this provided a measure of support to sustained communication and\u000d\u000a      convening efforts made in that regard. Such engagement helps to deepen the\u000d\u000a      understanding of the decolonisation process and makes progress on this\u000d\u000a      very difficult and intractable issue more likely. Clegg's recommendation\u000d\u000a      was taken on board and incorporated into the Report of the Special\u000d\u000a      Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the\u000d\u000a      Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and\u000d\u000a      Peoples for 2011 [4].\u000d\u000a    (iii) A sub-regional legislative review to consider the impact of\u000d\u000a        stigma and discrimination in the UK overseas territories.\u000d\u000a    As a consequence of Clegg's research and related publications, he was\u000d\u000a      asked by the health and social policy consultancy firm Options (www.options.co.uk)\u000d\u000a      (acting on behalf of the Department for International Development) to\u000d\u000a      undertake a review of international treaty commitments of the six\u000d\u000a      Caribbean Overseas Territories (including Bermuda) and their potential\u000d\u000a      role in safeguarding the rights of people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLHIV).\u000d\u000a      Clegg's work contributed a significant part of the report published in\u000d\u000a      2010 entitled `A sub-regional policy analysis and legislative review to\u000d\u000a      consider the impact of stigma and discrimination in the UK overseas\u000d\u000a      territories' [5]. The report and the related programme then provided\u000d\u000a      support to the National AIDS Programmes in the OTs.

Attempts\u000d\u000a      have been made, led by different UK governments, to improve the state of\u000d\u000a      public affairs in the TCI, but these attempts have lacked conviction.\u000d\u000a      Clegg concluded that the reasons for this included an absence of political\u000d\u000a      will in London, sensitivities in the UK about enforcing change in a\u000d\u000a      semi-autonomous territory that is financially self-sufficient, and the\u000d\u000a      loss of institutional memory in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in\u000d\u000a      particular. This piece of research underpins Clegg's contribution to the\u000d\u000a      report for Transparency International [1] and his article in Social\u000d\u000a        and Economic Studies [2].\u000d\u000a    (ii) Non-self-governing territories and their quest for\u000d\u000a        decolonisation.\u000d\u000a    The key concern of Clegg's on-going research around governance in the UK\u000d\u000a      Overseas Territories (OTs) (undertaken between January and March 2011, and\u000d\u000a      updated between February and April 2013) was the extent to which further\u000d\u000a      constitutional reform can be undertaken and greater autonomy be awarded in\u000d\u000a      the OTs. Any such reform is problematic because of the UK's reluctance to\u000d\u000a      offer more concessions which would diminish its powers of oversight.\u000d\u000a      Further, there is little consensus in the UK or the territories about how\u000d\u000a      decolonisation can be achieved and how full self-determination can be\u000d\u000a      exercised. The territories do not want independence, while the UK does not\u000d\u000a      accept free association or integration. In other words, after the recent\u000d\u000a      process of constitutional review, what more can be done to advance\u000d\u000a      self-determination and the achievement of political equality? Clegg found\u000d\u000a      that in order to make any progress in this Third International Decade for\u000d\u000a      the Eradication of Colonialism, three separate but related issues must be\u000d\u000a      addressed: (a) the possible (albeit likely moderate) changes in the\u000d\u000a      territories' constitutions that would advance self-government, e.g. end\u000d\u000a      the role of the Governor in chairing the local Cabinet or Executive\u000d\u000a      Council of Ministers (in Bermuda the Governor does not act as Chair, but\u000d\u000a      in the other territories he\/she does); (b) the ways in which the\u000d\u000a      territories can further develop and improve their systems of governance,\u000d\u000a      e.g. strengthen the level of parliamentary oversight of the executives,\u000d\u000a      for example via more powerful Public Accounts Committees; and (c) the ways\u000d\u000a      in which the UK government can reform its own administrative structures to\u000d\u000a      better facilitate the territories progress towards greater self-government,\u000d\u000a\u0009  e.g. territory administration and governance should be\u000d\u000a      developed as a distinct specialism and career path within Whitehall.\u000d\u000a    This piece of research underpinned Clegg's contribution to the United\u000d\u000a      Nations Caribbean regional seminar on decolonisation [3] and to the two\u000d\u000a      articles in Commonwealth and Comparative Politics [4] and Caribbean\u000d\u000a      Journal of International Relations and Diplomacy [5].\u000d\u000a    (iii) A sub-regional legislative review to consider the impact of\u000d\u000a        stigma and discrimination in the UK overseas territories.\u000d\u000a    Clegg's research in the Winter of 2009\/10 focused on the international\u000d\u000a      treaty commitments of the six UK Caribbean Overseas Territories (OTs)\u000d\u000a      (including Bermuda) and their potential role in safeguarding the rights of\u000d\u000a      people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLHIV). The research found that several\u000d\u000a      international treaties, including the International Covenant on Economic,\u000d\u000a      Social and Cultural Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political\u000d\u000a      Rights, and European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,\u000d\u000a      contained a number of articles which were potentially very important in\u000d\u000a      safeguarding the rights of PLHIV either directly or indirectly. The\u000d\u000a      research also found that these provisions were not always acknowledged by\u000d\u000a      the territory governments as being applicable to PLHIV, and greater\u000d\u000a      efforts were needed by local territory governments and the UK government\u000d\u000a      in applying the provisions in a universal way. This piece of research\u000d\u000a      underpins Clegg's contribution to the report for the Department for\u000d\u000a      International Development and Options [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40808","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3374084","Name":"Barbados"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of van den Anker's research has been deep within the local\u000d\u000a      region but also far-reaching on an international scale. Building on the\u000d\u000a      outcomes of the ESF project [2], van den Anker and colleagues sought to\u000d\u000a      raise awareness of modern forms of slavery, including the trafficking of\u000d\u000a      human beings into the UK and Ireland, across a range of fora, including a\u000d\u000a      public meeting in June 2007 as part of the Abolition 200 programme\u000d\u000a      organised by the University of Bristol's Centre for the Study of Poverty\u000d\u000a      and Social Justice [1].\u000d\u000a    Van den Anker's research was subsequently disseminated internationally to\u000d\u000a      policy makers and practitioners via the largest European network of\u000d\u000a      migration researchers (International Migration, Integration and Social\u000d\u000a      Cohesion &#8212; IMISCOE) in Stockholm 2009 where she spoke at a major public\u000d\u000a      event. Among the outcomes, as a result of discussions with the leader of\u000d\u000a      the undocumented migrants' movement, a local trade union started to\u000d\u000a      welcome potentially trafficked persons.\u000d\u000a    Similarly, at the largest international conference for policy-makers and\u000d\u000a      NGOs on migration (Metropolis) in Copenhagen 2009, the chair of the Dutch\u000d\u000a      national parliamentary commission responsible for policies on human\u000d\u000a      trafficking indicated that van den Anker's message on the accessibility of\u000d\u000a      migrant rights would be used in future work (and requested copies of her\u000d\u000a      publications to inform further developments).\u000d\u000a    Internationally, van den Anker's research has created direct benefits for\u000d\u000a      trafficked persons in many parts of the world primarily because of changes\u000d\u000a      in legislation that were lobbied for by NGOs who participated in her\u000d\u000a      projects [5]. For example, when the NGO La Strada drafted new Czech\u000d\u000a      anti-trafficking legislation, and when the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland\u000d\u000a      campaigned for a bridging visa for unemployed migrant workers to reduce\u000d\u000a      vulnerability to destitution. Further international impact occurred in\u000d\u000a      Washington, USA (February 2009) when the US civil servant responsible for\u000d\u000a      creating the annual `Trafficking in Persons' report indicated he would\u000d\u000a      look into trafficking into other industries after a lecture by van den\u000d\u000a      Anker. Following this invited lecture in Washington, she was invited to\u000d\u000a      present in Ghent (November 2009) and Barbados (November 2010), as a\u000d\u000a      consequence of which she has been directly influential in setting up the\u000d\u000a      first Caribbean-wide anti-trafficking NGO. This has improved victim\u000d\u000a      support and raised awareness in a region with a notoriously high\u000d\u000a      prevalence of human trafficking.\u000d\u000a    Within the REF period, her engagement culminated in June 2013 when van\u000d\u000a      den Anker addressed the Organization for Security and Co-operation in\u000d\u000a      Europe Alliance on Trafficking in Persons (OSCE), where her research\u000d\u000a      findings helped to set the agenda of the meeting as focused on global\u000d\u000a      justice and inequalities.\u000d\u000a    The benefit to potentially trafficked persons is predictably large as\u000d\u000a      these perspectives fed into policy decisions of member-states. The work\u000d\u000a      van den Anker developed through coalition building between academics,\u000d\u000a      policy makers, civil servants practitioners and NGOs also impacted the\u000d\u000a      OSCE meeting as all of these groups were present. Her multilevel,\u000d\u000a      multi-actor methodology spreading more widely has had a real benefit for\u000d\u000a      trafficked persons in practice [9].\u000d\u000a    Van den Anker's research has also had highly significant local impact [7,\u000d\u000a      8] which started when she created a Bristol-based counter-trafficking\u000d\u000a      coalition which developed into an organisation of 56 members. Bristol\u000d\u000a      Fawcett, with Bristol City Council and van den Anker, in partnership with\u000d\u000a      local charities and service providers, formed a network of experts,\u000d\u000a      activists and interested parties to highlight the links between\u000d\u000a      international poverty and trafficking [4]. The coalition had a strong\u000d\u000a      input on the Scrutiny Commission for Safety and Community Cohesion Inquiry\u000d\u000a      day on Human Trafficking in November 2009 where van den Anker gave a\u000d\u000a      lecture and presented the coalition statement asking the City Council to\u000d\u000a      follow up their commitment to the Council of Europe Convention on action\u000d\u000a      against trafficking by providing resources for housing and a Migrant\u000d\u000a      Rights Centre in Bristol. The coalition subsequently launched a Migrant\u000d\u000a      Rights Centre Bristol (MRCB), led by van den Anker, which holds drop-in\u000d\u000a      sessions once a week and runs campaigns on migrant rights [3]. Bristol\u000d\u000a      City Council has since appointed a dedicated anti-trafficking officer and\u000d\u000a      has set up a Roma drop-in centre modelled on the MRCB.\u000d\u000a    Van den Anker has actively sought to engage wider audiences through\u000d\u000a      awareness raising and training events. For example, a training day at the\u000d\u000a      International Global Ethics Association bi-annual conference at UWE in\u000d\u000a      June 2010 informed 15 local and regional organisations about human\u000d\u000a      trafficking. Van den Anker has also been instrumental in the design and\u000d\u000a      delivery of a training programme for 200 Bristol City Council employees\u000d\u000a      who are cascading out the awareness-raising campaign to 16,000 council\u000d\u000a      workers [6]. At the 2010 meeting of the Scrutiny Commission for Safety and\u000d\u000a      Community Cohesion, a commitment was made to roll out van den Anker's\u000d\u000a      training programme at Bristol City Council to the NHS and the police; and\u000d\u000a      a council-wide strategy and protocol on anti-trafficking measures and\u000d\u000a      migrant rights was recommended.\u000d\u000a    The Commission also agreed the wide definition of trafficking as\u000d\u000a      developed in van den Anker's research. This means Bristol has been able to\u000d\u000a      support trafficked persons and exploited migrants more effectively. At the\u000d\u000a      January 2011 meeting of Bristol City Council's Scrutiny Commission, a\u000d\u000a      statement by van den Anker was endorsed to commission the development of a\u000d\u000a      protocol and strategy for accessibility of migrant rights including those\u000d\u000a      of trafficked person, undocumented and self-employed;\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      to ensure that the trained programme developed for cascading out in\u000d\u000a        the Council is strongly recommended to the other statutory agencies;\u000d\u000a      to protect the dedicated officer's role in developing Bristol City\u000d\u000a        Council's involvement in the Bristol Counter Trafficking Coalition [10]\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Trafficked persons have benefitted directly from van den Anker's research\u000d\u000a      at UWE through improved support and legislation.

She innovated the human trafficking debate in three major\u000d\u000a      respects by:\u000d\u000a    i) moving the debate on from a focus on women in the sex industry to a\u000d\u000a      wider perspective on migrant labour exploitation.\u000d\u000a    ii) introducing a human rights perspective, which showed that the current\u000d\u000a      policies were concentrating too much on criminal justice and not on victim\u000d\u000a      protection; her research showed that this led to a neglect of the\u000d\u000a      prevention of trafficking as this would require building human rights\u000d\u000a      cultures in countries of origin, transit and destination.\u000d\u000a    3. combining a multidisciplinary approach to global justice with\u000d\u000a      qualitative research methods to develop case studies, through open-ended\u000d\u000a      interviews, observation and auto-ethnographic research. [R4]\u000d\u000a    By building a European network of people and organisations working on\u000d\u000a      human trafficking, van den Anker's research found the focus on women and\u000d\u000a      the sex industry unwarranted [R1]. In contrast, van den Anker found\u000d\u000a      evidence for the widespread occurrence of labour exploitation in European\u000d\u000a      union countries, gaps in the provision for victim identification and\u000d\u000a      protection, as well as slow implementation of the European directive on\u000d\u000a      harmonisation with the UN Palermo protocol [R2]. She concluded that\u000d\u000a      transnational social investment was urgently needed, given the overlapping\u000d\u000a      complex and restrictive immigration, labour and welfare regimes in the\u000d\u000a      participating countries which create serious gaps in human rights\u000d\u000a      protection for migrants. She concluded that the response to trafficking\u000d\u000a      and migrant labour exploitation should not criminalise migrants or\u000d\u000a      discourage migration, but ought to provide human rights cultures in\u000d\u000a      countries of origin, safe migration options and protection of migrant\u000d\u000a      rights in countries of destination.\u000d\u000a    Between 2006 and 2010, van den Anker developed this research further as\u000d\u000a      leader of a project on `Trafficking for Forced Labour in Europe'. The\u000d\u000a      project was supported by European Science Foundation, with partners from\u000d\u000a      Ireland, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic and Belgium [R3]. Through this\u000d\u000a      work, she identified links between the practice of trafficking in persons,\u000d\u000a      smuggling and exploitation of undocumented migrant workers. She concluded\u000d\u000a      that the tightening of legal options for labour migration creates\u000d\u000a      vulnerability to migrant exploitation due to increasing dependence on\u000d\u000a      intermediaries in the migration industry [R4]. Van den Anker also showed a\u000d\u000a      widespread reliance of the European economies on flexible and cheap\u000d\u000a      migrant labour which risked sacrificing the protection of migrant rights\u000d\u000a      [R5]. She concluded that the lack of accessibility of human rights for\u000d\u000a      migrants was a central concern that needed to be addressed more urgently\u000d\u000a      [R6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41010","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dr Falkner's research has underpinned three distinct impacts on policy\u000a      and regulatory debates, in\u000a      the UK and in Europe. These impacts have resulted from systematic\u000a      engagement of regulators,\u000a      policy-makers and other stakeholders both in the research process itself\u000a      and through a targeted\u000a      strategy for disseminating research findings.\u000a    1) Shaping the Policy Debate on Nanomaterials Regulation\u000a    Outreach to the policy community was a central component of Dr Falkner's\u000a      work for the\u000a      LSE\/Chatham House project on the comparative dimensions of EU and US\u000a      nanotechnologies\u000a      regulation. The project involved a survey of regulatory and policy experts\u000a      and one-to-one meetings\u000a      and interviews with 68 regulators, business leaders and civil society\u000a      representatives on both sides\u000a      of the Atlantic. The process of drafting and reviewing the project report\u000a      included extensive\u000a      involvement of key experts from regulatory institutions in London,\u000a      Brussels and Washington, DC.\u000a      These experts were asked to feed into the research process, and some\u000a      participated in a review\u000a      workshop or gave written comments on the draft report [Source C]. The\u000a      close engagement of the\u000a      policy community ensured a high level of awareness about the LSE\/Chatham\u000a      House project and\u000a      trust in its findings.\u000a    The final report, Securing the Promise of Nanotechnologies: Towards\u000a        Transatlantic Regulatory\u000a        Cooperation [A], along with other publications resulting from the\u000a      project, was widely circulated to\u000a      policymakers, regulators and other stakeholders through a series of\u000a      outreach events both in the\u000a      UK and abroad. The report was launched at a major international conference\u000a      at Chatham House,\u000a      London, in September 2009, which was attended by European and US\u000a      policymakers, regulators\u000a      and stakeholders from industry and civil society [B]. Four more outreach\u000a      events were held in the\u000a      autumn of 2009, in order to further disseminate the research findings to\u000a      policy-makers and\u000a      regulators in the capitals of key countries: Brussels, Berlin, Paris and\u000a      Washington, DC. The\u000a      research findings were also presented at a European Commission-sponsored\u000a      conference in\u000a      Brussels on 16 November 2009, which was attended by representatives of the\u000a      European\u000a      Commission and European Parliament [B].\u000a    The report's findings were reported widely by trade publications and in\u000a      international media: The\u000a      Financial Times' science editor Clive Cookson drew attention to the\u000a      report's call for a mandatory\u000a      register [D]; Nanomagazine referred to the project report as `ground\u000a      breaking' and reported on the\u000a      call for the `establishment of a mandatory reporting system for\u000a      nano-enabled products' [E] and\u000a      ENDS Europe similarly focused on the call for a nanomaterials register in\u000a      its coverage of the\u000a      report's findings [F].\u000a    2) Impact on UK House of Lords Science and Technology Committee Report\u000a        on\u000a        `Nanotechnologies and Food'\u000a    As a result of the contribution to the policy debate of Securing the\u000a      Promise of Nanotechnologies,\u000a      Dr Falkner was called to give written and oral evidence [H] to the only\u000a      parliamentary enquiry to\u000a      date dealing with nanotechnology regulation: the 2009 House of Lords\u000a      Science and Technology\u000a      committee inquiry into nanotechnologies and food. Dr Falkner's evidence\u000a      shaped the committee's\u000a      focus on questions of transparency and information disclosure of\u000a      nanomaterials in food and was\u000a      used extensively in the committee report as evidence in support of their\u000a      call for mandatory\u000a      reporting. In its concluding report `Nanotechnologies and Food' [I],\u000a      published on 8 January 2010,\u000a      the House of Lords committee relied extensively on Dr Falkner's testimony,\u000a      noting his evidence in\u000a      13 separate sub-paragraphs, as well as making reference to the underlying\u000a      research. The\u000a      committee explicitly endorsed several of the research findings and policy\u000a      recommendations, in\u000a      particular the need for strengthened international coordination and\u000a      information exchange by\u000a      international organisations (6.29) and the creation of \"a public register\u000a      of foods containing\u000a      nanomaterials\" (7..24). The latter recommendation is beginning to have an\u000a      impact on\u000a      governmental thinking and practice as is evident from the UK government's\u000a      response to the House\u000a      of Lords report [J]. In it, HMG states that, with regard to paragraph 7.24\u000a      of the House of Lords\u000a      report, the \"Food Standards Agency accepts this recommendation and agrees\u000a      that there are\u000a      benefits in setting up a publicly accessible register of available food\u000a      and food packaging products\u000a      containing nanomaterials\" (page 16).\u000a    3) Impact on European regulatory debate on mandatory nanomaterials\u000a        reporting\u000a    European and international discussions on strengthened regulatory\u000a      oversight of nanotechnologies\u000a      are at an early stage. Nevertheless, active dissemination of Dr Falkner's\u000a      research to policy\u000a      audiences worldwide has contributed to stimulating policy debate\u000a      particularly on the need to\u000a      strengthen regulatory capacity and enhance transparency about\u000a      nanomaterials. Dr Falkner's\u000a      research has been cited by several civil society and science organisations\u000a      particularly in the\u000a      context of recent calls for the introduction of mandatory nanomaterials\u000a      reporting. A feasibility study\u000a      of mandatory nanomaterials reporting commissioned by Germany's Environment\u000a      Ministry (BMU)\u000a      refers to Dr Falkner's research as evidence of growing scientific support\u000a      for the introduction of a\u000a      nanomaterials register [K]. There is now growing recognition that existing\u000a      voluntary reporting is\u000a      inadequate, and momentum is growing in Europe for the introduction of\u000a      formal reporting\u000a      requirements, with France being the first EU country to establish a\u000a      mandatory register in January\u000a      2013 [G].\u000a    Wider Implications: Manipulating matter at the molecular level to\u000a      produce novel `nanomaterials'\u000a      has considerable potential commercial and societal benefits, including\u000a      improvements in food safety\u000a      and storage, enhanced battery performance, water purification and\u000a      environmental remediation,\u000a      reduced weight and power consumption in electronics, more effective drug\u000a      delivery systems, and\u000a      stronger, lighter and more durable materials. Dr Falkner's contribution to\u000a      developing robust risk\u000a      regulation underpins the establishment of public trust in these novel\u000a      technologies that is critical to\u000a      realising of these benefits while simultaneously protecting the public\u000a      against risk.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Robert Falkner's research into international risk regulation for\u000a      emerging technologies underpins\u000a      the work of the Nanotechnology Policy and Regulation programme at LSE.

His research has been recognised\u000a      internationally through\u000a      competitive research grant awards totalling over &#163;500,000 since 2002,\u000a      including from the ESRC,\u000a      European Commission, MacArthur Foundation, Open Society Foundation and\u000a      Rockefeller\u000a      Foundation. In 2008, he established the Nanotechnology Policy and\u000a      Regulation programme at\u000a      LSE, which conducted two major research projects on nanotechnology\u000a      regulation that focused on\u000a      how to strengthen regulatory capacity in a transatlantic and international\u000a      context. As part of this\u000a      project, Dr Falkner oversaw the work of two early-career researchers in\u000a      the Department of\u000a      International Relations (Nico Jaspers, Carmen Gayoso) and collaborated\u000a      with LSE experts in\u000a      related fields, including Professor George Gaskell (Department of Social\u000a      Psychology), Professor\u000a      Bridget Hutter (Centre for Analysis of Risk and Regulation), and Professor\u000a      Nik Rose (Department\u000a      of Sociology\/BIOS, until 2011).\u000a    Over the last decade, Dr Falkner's research has sought to answer the\u000a      question of what regulatory\u000a      institutions and instruments are needed to manage the often uncertain\u000a      environmental and health\u000a      risks of emerging technologies? The empirical focus of this work from\u000a      2002-2006 was in the area\u000a      of biotechnology and genetically modified (GM) food but since 2006 has\u000a      shifted as\u000a      nanotechnologies moved centre stage.\u000a    Dr Falkner's early research on biosafety regulation for GM food revealed\u000a      how persistent scientific\u000a      uncertainty undermines both the development of robust regulatory oversight\u000a      by national\u000a      governments and international cooperation on risk regulation (publications\u000a      1, 3, 4). His analysis of\u000a      the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, the world's first international\u000a      regime to deal with safety risks\u000a      of GM food, identified transparency, information disclosure through\u000a      labelling, and prior informed\u000a      consent rules as key regulatory mechanisms that strengthen regulatory\u000a      oversight particularly in\u000a      developing countries (publications 2, 5). These research findings were\u000a      later applied to the\u000a      regulation of nanomaterials. (Nanotechnologies make it possible to\u000a      manipulate matter at the\u000a      molecular level, typically at a scale of 100 nanometres or less (a\u000a      nanometre being one-billionth of a\u000a      metre). Nanomaterials (a) have particles or constituents of nanoscale\u000a      dimensions or (b) are\u000a      produced by nanotechnologies.) As with biosafety, a high degree of\u000a      scientific uncertainty stymies\u000a      attempts to strengthen regulatory capacity and develop international\u000a      cooperation. In this regard,\u000a      bio- and nanotechnologies were found to pose similar challenges for EHS\u000a      regulation. A\u000a      comparative study of EU and US nanotechnology regulation revealed that\u000a      regulators lack\u000a      comprehensive knowledge about the presence of nanomaterials in\u000a      internationally traded goods,\u000a      despite estimates of over 1000 such products in circulation (publication\u000a      6). Dr Falkner's research\u000a      demonstrates the urgent need to fill such knowledge gaps about the\u000a      commercialisation of\u000a      nanotechnologies and establish mandatory information disclosure\u000a      requirements as a critical first\u000a      step towards a strengthened regulatory capacity.\u000a    Key Researcher: Robert Falkner has been at LSE since 2002.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41033","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Karen Smith's research has underpinned two distinct impacts on\u000d\u000a      EU policymaking and practitioner debate.\u000d\u000a    1) Study for the Directorate General for External Policies of the\u000d\u000a        Union, `The European Union and the Review of the Human Rights Council'\u000d\u000a    On the basis of her research in the field of EU human rights policies,\u000d\u000a      and in the context of a review of the United Nations Human Rights Council,\u000d\u000a      Professor Smith was commissioned by the European Parliament's\u000d\u000a      Sub-Committee on Human Rights to analyse the EU's role in the Human Rights\u000d\u000a      Council since the latter's creation in 2006, and to consider the EU's role\u000d\u000a      in the review process. Building on research by Smith that highlighted the\u000d\u000a      failures of the EU's human rights record within the UN system, the report\u000d\u000a      [A] argued that the EU urgently needed to improve its capacity for\u000d\u000a      outreach. It further emphasised the need to better coordinate the EU's\u000d\u000a      human rights positions with its other external relations policies, so it\u000d\u000a      could become more ambitious in its approach at the Human Rights Council.\u000d\u000a    Professor Smith's report, reinforced by her oral evidence to the meeting\u000d\u000a      of the Human Rights Sub-Committee [B], was instrumental in determining\u000d\u000a      how the Sub-Committee evaluated the EU's record at the United Nations, and\u000d\u000a      shaped the European Parliament's policy response to the review of the\u000d\u000a      UNHRC. The study was used extensively by the Committee's political group\u000d\u000a      advisors in their preparation of the European Parliament's recommendation\u000d\u000a      to the Council on the HRC review [C]. The resulting resolution [D] to a\u000d\u000a      great degree reflected the substance of Professor Smith's recommendations,\u000d\u000a      and endorsed Professor Smith's proposal for the EU to support the use of\u000d\u000a      `independent triggers' and call for improvements to the transparency and\u000d\u000a      oversight of Special Procedures.\u000d\u000a    2) Task Force on EU Prevention of Mass Atrocities\u000d\u000a    The Foundation for the International Prevention of Genocide and Mass\u000d\u000a      Atrocities launched a Task Force on EU Prevention of Mass Atrocities to\u000d\u000a      assess the EU's capabilities in the area of the prevention of mass\u000d\u000a      atrocities. As co-Chair, Professor Smith co-authored the report of the\u000d\u000a      Task Force [E], which has had impact on debate and policy at both EU and\u000d\u000a      member state levels, as well as at the UN.\u000d\u000a    The process of drafting the report involved significant collaboration\u000d\u000a      with the policy community [F]. Three meetings, in Berlin, Paris and\u000d\u000a      Brussels, attended by national and EU policy officials, were used to\u000d\u000a      discuss drafts and test and build support for the Task Force's\u000d\u000a      recommendations. These meetings built on months of individual discussions\u000d\u000a      with officials and the wider policy community which provided specific and\u000d\u000a      detailed input and feedback, both verbally and in writing [K].\u000d\u000a    A draft of the Task Force's report was circulated widely throughout\u000d\u000a      relevant units in the European External Action Service and some EU member\u000d\u000a      states' foreign ministries in December 2012, resulting in substantive\u000d\u000a      feedback on the report's conclusions [K]. The final report identified core\u000d\u000a      problems impeding the ability of the EU and its member states to prevent\u000d\u000a      mass atrocities and made a number of recommendations to strengthen the\u000d\u000a      EU's capacity for mass atrocity prevention.\u000d\u000a    Following the report's Brussels launch, a programme of systematic\u000d\u000a      dissemination and engagement followed, including media op-eds and\u000d\u000a      interviews, and presentations of the report to the UNHRC and policymakers\u000d\u000a      in London, Geneva, Rome, Berlin and Budapest, with events in other\u000d\u000a      capitals scheduled for autumn 2014 and spring 2015 [F]. At the European\u000d\u000a      Parliament, the Rapporteur of the Foreign Affairs Committee gave comments\u000d\u000a      on the draft of the Task Force Report [G], which guided the writing of the\u000d\u000a      Committee's own Report containing a proposal for an EP resolution [H],\u000d\u000a      which was adopted by the Parliament in April 2013 [I].\u000d\u000a    At the UN level, Adama Dieng, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on\u000d\u000a      the Prevention of Genocide, has publically endorsed the Task Force [J].\u000d\u000a      Similar pressure has also come from individual states, including the UK\u000d\u000a      Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which raised the report at EU level,\u000d\u000a      having been closely engaged with the drafting process and welcoming its\u000d\u000a      recommendations. Mark Simmonds, the minister responsible for conflict\u000d\u000a      issues in the FCO, has asked Professor Smith to brief departmental\u000d\u000a      officials in person [K].\u000d\u000a    In tandem, the Report has been extensively utilised by civil society\u000d\u000a      groups to lobby at member state level. These governmental impacts have\u000d\u000a      been buttressed by sustained media coverage of the Report's conclusions\u000d\u000a      and recommendations, which has generated wider consciousness in the\u000d\u000a      general public of the issues raised [L].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Karen E.

It has sought to explain\u000d\u000a      the policies the EU's foreign policy system produces, and to assess\u000d\u000a      related issues of consistency, coherence and effectiveness of EU foreign\u000d\u000a      policy [5]. In particular, she has examined the EU's pursuit of so-called\u000d\u000a      'ethical' foreign policy goals, including the EU's promotion of human\u000d\u000a      rights [1,2,3,6]. This research has emphasised the limits to EU unity in\u000d\u000a      emphasising ethical concerns: the EU's member states and institutions find\u000d\u000a      it difficult to agree and maintain common positions regarding human rights\u000d\u000a      in relations with third countries. Human rights jostle with other policy\u000d\u000a      objectives, and there are disagreements over how to promote human rights\u000d\u000a      in any particular case. The resulting inconsistency in EU policies (with\u000d\u000a      some violations overlooked and others punished, for example) is one of the\u000d\u000a      reasons why any policy cohesion among EU members is difficult to translate\u000d\u000a      into influence in international institutions charged with developing human\u000d\u000a      rights policies: the EU is accused of hypocrisy and double standards,\u000d\u000a      limiting its external effectiveness. In addition, she found that EU member\u000d\u000a      states must devote so much attention to resolving internal disagreements\u000d\u000a      that they have little to spend building support for their common positions\u000d\u000a      in the United Nations [1,2,3]. In 2007, Professor Smith's contribution was\u000d\u000a      recognised when she received the Anna Lindh award for outstanding work in\u000d\u000a      European foreign and security policy research. As a result of this\u000d\u000a      research, Professor Smith was commissioned by the European Parliament's\u000d\u000a      Sub-Committee on Human Rights to conduct a study of the role of the\u000d\u000a      European Union in the Human Rights Council.\u000d\u000a    Professor Smith's interest in ethical foreign policy goals led to more\u000d\u000a      recent research on European policymaking in the area of genocide\u000d\u000a      prevention and response. This seeks to explain why Europeans have so often\u000d\u000a      failed to reach agreement to either recognise or adequately address\u000d\u000a      instances of genocide. Smith's convention-challenging research, set out in\u000d\u000a      Genocide and the Europeans [4], found that despite Europe's historic\u000d\u000a      experience of genocide in the Second World War, some European governments\u000d\u000a      were hostile to the 1948 Genocide Convention, and European governments\u000d\u000a      have been reluctant to use the term genocide to describe atrocities ever\u000d\u000a      since. This work provided a systematic treatment of the reasons why\u000d\u000a      European governments have rarely been able to agree on whether to call a\u000d\u000a      situation genocide; and why their responses to purported genocides have\u000d\u000a      often been limited to delivering humanitarian aid and supporting\u000d\u000a      prosecution of perpetrators in international criminal tribunals, whilst\u000d\u000a      more coercive measures such as sanctions or military intervention have\u000d\u000a      typically been rejected. Governments fear that if they use the term\u000d\u000a      `genocide' they will come under considerable pressure to respond, in ways\u000d\u000a      that are inimical to their interests. Therefore they seek to avoid use of\u000d\u000a      the term altogether. As a result of this research, the Foundation for the\u000d\u000a      International Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities asked Professor\u000d\u000a      Smith to act as Co-Chair of its Task Force on EU Prevention of Mass\u000d\u000a      Atrocities.\u000d\u000a    Key Researcher: Professor Smith has been at LSE since 1997.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41117","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"458258","Name":"Latvia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    1) Transparency of Voting in the European Parliament: The main\u000a      impacts of the research on voting in the European Parliament (EP), backed\u000a      up by the VoteWatch website, have been: (a) to change the way recorded\u000a      (roll-call) votes work in the EP, and (b) to increase the understanding of\u000a      voting in the EP amongst policymakers, the media, interest groups, and\u000a      private citizens. Under pressure from VoteWatch and other actors, in 2009\u000a      the EP changed its Rules of Procedure to make all final votes on\u000a      legislative proposals by `roll-call'. Prior to this decision, roll-call\u000a      votes were only held if requested by a certain number of MEPs. This\u000a      decision, and VoteWatch's continued tracking of voting in the EP, has\u000a      increased public and policymakers' understanding of voting in the EP.\u000a    VoteWatch is a good example of how cutting-edge academic research can be\u000a      combined with modern information dissemination techniques to increase the\u000a      transparency of political decision-making and public understanding of the\u000a      actions and behaviour of elected politicians. VoteWatch is a\u000a      not-for-profit organisation co-funded by the Open Society Institute and\u000a      The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, with pro bono support from\u000a      Burson-Marsteller and White &amp; Case.

The BBC, EurActiv,\u000a      EUObserver, and EP websites link directly to VoteWatch [Source H].\u000a    To promote VoteWatch and its findings, Hix presented his research on\u000a      numerous occasions between 2007 and 2012 to MEPs and their assistants,\u000a      interest groups and policymakers in Brussels and several national\u000a      capitals. He also gave evidence to the EU Committee of the House of Lords.\u000a      After the launch of VoteWatch in 2009, Hix was invited to a day-long\u000a      seminar with the EU Ombudsman to discuss ways in which decision-making in\u000a      the EP could be made more transparent [J]. The EP also invited the\u000a      VoteWatch team to participate in hearings on the transparency of EP voting\u000a      and our proposals were discussed by the EP's ruling body, the Bureau. Some\u000a      of VoteWatch's proposals were included in the EP's communication policy\u000a      for 2011, such as publishing votes from EP committees.\u000a    VoteWatch is now known and quoted in all member states by NGOs,\u000a      journalists and citizens when it comes to assessing the performance of\u000a      their elected representatives in Brussels and Strasbourg [A]. The\u000a      significance of VoteWatch's activities can also be seen by the fact that,\u000a      following our criticism of the Council and the European Parliament's\u000a      transparency practices, both institutions have invited our team to\u000a      participate in public hearings and internal meetings on the subject. In\u000a      the Council, the secretariat has discussed and acted on VoteWatch's\u000a      proposals for a more transparent reporting of EU legislative decisions by\u000a      making more information on Member State positions public ahead of\u000a      ministerial meetings [A]. In the EP, our proposals have been discussed in\u000a      its ruling body, the Bureau, and in the full plenary [B]. As a result,\u000a      some of our proposals have been included in the Council's and EP's\u000a      respective communication policy and tools in 2011 and 2012.\u000a    In 2010 VoteWatch was named as an example of best practice for using\u000a      e-democracy tools to hold politicians accountable at two prestigious\u000a      international conferences: the Personal Democracy Forum (in Barcelona in\u000a      October 2010) and the World E-Democracy Forum (in Paris in October 2010).\u000a    We have evidence that VoteWatch has had a direct impact on MEPs'\u000a      behaviour [C]. First, three cases are known to the VoteWatch team where\u000a      MEPs were challenged during the EP elections in 2009 regarding their\u000a      records reported on VoteWatch.eu, and where the MEPs ultimately lost their\u000a      seats following unsuccessful justifications of their records (1 MEP from\u000a      Ireland, 1 MEP from Sweden and 1 MEP from Latvia). National media made\u000a      extensive use of the VoteWatch website and analyses in the run-up to the\u000a      elections [D]. Second, MEPs are known to pay greater attention to their\u000a      attendance records in voting situations and debates in the EP Plenary due\u000a      to the VoteWatch reporting. Third, other recorded activities on the\u000a      VoteWatch website &#8212; such as tabling of questions and involvement in\u000a      writing of reports &#8212; have increased dramatically, particularly from MEPs\u000a      outside the three dominant centre parties.\u000a    2) Reform of the EP Electoral System: The main impact of Hix's\u000a      research on the operation of EP elections has been the inclusion of his\u000a      proposal for the use of preferential-voting systems in the most recent EP\u000a      reform proposal. Hix was invited in 2008 to present and submit evidence to\u000a      EP hearings on the reform of its electoral system. The research undertaken\u000a      for the submission led to the article in Politique Europeenne. Hix and\u000a      Marsh also set up a website to predict the 2009 EP elections (www.Predict09.eu),\u000a      which was widely covered by the media [D]. Hix also wrote for the\u000a      BBC website during the elections on how to reform the elections [E].\u000a    Hix's submission to the EP hearings was cited in the reform proposal (the\u000a      Duff Report) [F]. In addition, Hix's proposal that all member states\u000a      should use a form of preferential-voting (Open-List PR or STV), was a main\u000a      recommendation in the reform. The proposal is now in the process of being\u000a      adopted by the European Parliament and the EU Council. Even if the\u000a      proposal is not adopted before the 2014 European Parliament elections,\u000a      there is now an on-going debate about how `preferential voting' in these\u000a      elections could force candidates to campaign directly to voters, rather\u000a      than leaving the electoral campaigns to parties. Such a change would\u000a      significantly strengthen the relationship between citizens and their\u000a      elected representatives in the European Parliament.\u000a    3) Election of the Commission President: The main impact of Hix's\u000a      research on \"democratic reform\" in the EU has been the growing acceptance\u000a      of his proposal for a competitive election for the Commission President\u000a      [C, G, H].\u000a    Hix was invited in 2002 to chair a working group to advise the Cabinet\u000a      Office during the drafting of the Constitutional Treaty. The group fed\u000a      ideas into UK government strategy, and Hix personally briefed Sir Stephen\u000a      Wall, Director of the Cabinet Office's European Secretariat. Hix was\u000a      invited by the British government to speak on the election of the\u000a      Commission President at a UK-Dutch government conference in The Hague in\u000a      2005, and at a meeting of the chairs of the EU affairs committees of the\u000a      national parliaments, in Florence in 2007. In 2008 President Barroso\u000a      invited Hix to a private dinner with Barroso and his advisors to discuss\u000a      Commission President election [I]. And, in 2012, Hix was invited to\u000a      present his ideas for democratising a `fiscal union' to the European\u000a      Central Bank.\u000a    During the Convention on the Future of Europe, Hix's proposal for an\u000a      \"electoral college\" for choosing the Commission President was adopted by\u000a      several think-tanks [K]. This idea was also taken up by the Swedish and\u000a      Irish governments. But, following the Lisbon Treaty the debate shifted to\u000a      how to reform the election of the Commission President within the treaty\u000a      rules. Hix's proposal for rival candidates before EP elections was adopted\u000a      by several think-tanks, such as Notre Europe in Paris [L]. Following an\u000a      on-going debate, which was in part provoked by Hix's book, in 2010 the\u000a      Party of European Socialists set up a working group to come up with a\u000a      candidate before the 2014 elections.\u000a    If rival candidates for the Commission President are proposed before the\u000a      2014 European Parliament elections, this is likely to transform the nature\u000a      of these elections, and will also have an impact on the relationship\u000a      between the next Commission President and the EP, the EU Governments, and\u000a      the EU citizens.\u000a    The reach of Hix's impact in these three areas is perhaps best summed up\u000a      in a statement by Klaus Welle, the Secretary-General of the European\u000a      Parliament [C]: \"Overall, Professor Hix's on-going attention to EP\u000a      activities and advocacy for reform are important contributions to the EP's\u000a      broader efforts to more transparently and effectively relate with its 500\u000a      million constituents within an increasingly democratic EU.\"\u000a    WIDER IMPLICATIONS:\u000a      The `democratic deficit' is an on-going concern in EU politics. By\u000a      enabling more effective public scrutiny of EU decision-making, and by\u000a      analysing alternative ways of selecting MEPs and the Commission President,\u000a      Simon Hix's research is helping to address the EU's legitimacy problems.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Simon Hix on the democratic reform of the European Union has\u000a      helped to transform the way politicians, policymakers, journalists and\u000a      interest groups understand how EU politics works, and as a result has\u000a      changed the way the EU institutions work. Hix's research has achieved the\u000a      following key impacts: 1) www.VoteWatch.eu\u000a      is the leading website for tracking the voting behaviour of MEPs and\u000a      governments in the EU Council; 2) recorded (\"roll-call votes\") are now\u000a      taken in the European Parliament (EP) on all final votes on EU legislative\u000a      proposals; 3) the Duff Report on the reform of the EP electoral system\u000a      proposed to introduce preferential-voting in all EU member states; and 4)\u000a      there is growing support amongst think tanks, NGOs and political parties\u000a      for a competitive election of the Commission President, which Hix has\u000a      advocated for several years. In November 2012, on the 40th anniversary of\u000a      British membership of the EU, the media group EurActiv named Simon Hix\u000a      amongst \"the 40 most influential Britons on EU policy\".

This\u000a      method involved the development of a new index for measuring the cohesion\u000a      of groups in a parliament and the application of advanced scaling\u000a      techniques (e.g. NOMINATE and IDEAL) to estimate the positions of MEPs,\u000a      parties and groups. Building on the methods developed in this research,\u000a      Hix, Sara Hagemann and Doru Frantescu set up www.VoteWatch.eu\u000a      in 2009. The VoteWatch website collects, analyses and publishes all\u000a      recorded votes in the EP in real-time. In 2011, VoteWatch was expanded to\u000a      include votes in the EU Council.\u000a    2) Reform of the EP Electoral System: In an article in World\u000a        Politics in 2004 [2], Hix showed that MEPs elected on \"preferential\"\u000a      electoral systems (Open-List PR or STV) are less responsive to their party\u000a      leaders than MEPs elected on Closed-List PR systems. Then, in an article\u000a      in Journal of Politics in 2007 [4], Hix and Michael Marsh analysed\u000a      the performance of parties in European elections to understand the\u000a      conditions under which these elections are contested on national or\u000a      European issues. Building on these papers, in an article in Politique\u000a        Europeene [6], Hix and Sara Hagemann (LSE) found that citizens are\u000a      better informed about EP elections and are more likely to be contacted by\u000a      MEPs in member states that use candidate-centred electoral systems (e.g.\u000a      Open-List PR) than in states that use party-centred systems (Closed-List\u000a      PR).\u000a    3) Election of the Commission President: The EU Constitutional\u000a      Convention (which led to the Lisbon Treaty) launched a debate about how\u000a      the Commission President should be elected. At that time, Hix proposed &#8212; in a paper for the UK Cabinet Office, an Op-Ed in FT, and a pamphlet for\u000a      the Foreign Policy Centre [1] &#8212; a \"college\" to elect the Commission\u000a      President composed of national parliamentarians. The pamphlet set out the\u000a      case for an election for the Commission President and explained how an\u000a      electoral college could work. Following the Lisbon Treaty, in the book What's\u000a        Wrong with the European Union and How to Fix It [5], Hix proposed\u000a      the nomination of rival candidates for the President prior to EP\u000a      elections. The book, inter alia, justified the politicisation of the\u000a      highest EU office, and set out a scenario of how this post might work.\u000a    Key Researcher: Simon Hix, FBA, has been at LSE since 1997.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41248","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    King's research had direct impact on gender and human development policy\u000d\u000a      and practice and\u000d\u000a      implementation in the ECOWAS Conflict Prevention Framework. Specifically,\u000d\u000a      in two ways: (1) the\u000d\u000a      formal concept of `youth' used by ECOWAS was changed in response to\u000d\u000a      research findings, and\u000d\u000a      policy and practice were extended to those between 25 and 35, which had\u000d\u000a      previously only applied\u000d\u000a      up to the age of 24; and (2) policy and practice regarding women in peace\u000d\u000a      and security was\u000d\u000a      transformed and new policy and practice adopted, with researchers from\u000d\u000a      King's being invited to\u000d\u000a      translate findings directly into policy formation and implementation. In\u000d\u000a      this latter role, King's\u000d\u000a      researchers drafted parts of policy documents subsequently adopted by\u000d\u000a      ECOWAS, and drafted the\u000d\u000a      Plan of Action for implementation.\u000d\u000a    Research was designed and developed in cooperation with ECOWAS, with\u000d\u000a      continuing\u000d\u000a      engagement throughout, meaning that findings could be presented well ahead\u000d\u000a      of academic\u000d\u000a      publications and final reports reflecting the research, including showing\u000d\u000a      commissioned short films\u000d\u000a      made to illustrate research findings, and also that ECOWAS could make\u000d\u000a      changes.\u000d\u000a    Research findings on youth, militancy and violence were presented\u000d\u000a      directly, by arrangement, to the\u000d\u000a      Meeting of Experts on Youth and Sports of ECOWAS Member States, in\u000d\u000a      Cotonou, on 23 July\u000d\u000a      2008. The presentation on `vulnerability of youths in West Africa' was\u000d\u000a      noted in the Final Report of\u000d\u000a      the Meeting. The report concluded that `the youths of the sub-region\u000d\u000a      constitute a huge potentiality\u000d\u000a      to be exploited' and decided that `the documents presented be communicated\u000d\u000a      to Member States\u000d\u000a      for exploitation.' (Source (i), VI, p.7) Following this, research was\u000d\u000a      presented at the ECOWAS\u000d\u000a      Council (equivalent of the European Council, the executive level of the\u000d\u000a      organisation) Meeting of\u000d\u000a      Ministers of Youth and Sports, in Cotonou, 25 July 2008. As a result of\u000d\u000a      these presentations, the\u000d\u000a      age range covered by the label `youth' was extended by ECOWAS. The\u000d\u000a      significance and reach of\u000d\u000a      this impact is indicated by the ECOWAS Council's adopting this conceptual\u000d\u000a      change and new\u000d\u000a      approach to `youth' in policy and practice designed to address alienation\u000d\u000a      and potential violence;\u000d\u000a      thereby widening conflict prevention activities to the vast and vulnerable\u000d\u000a      cohort of 25-35-year olds.\u000d\u000a      ECOWAS signed a Memorandum of Understanding under which King's shared\u000d\u000a      research on youth\u000d\u000a      and violence and assisted implementation of Youth Policy.

Specifically, King's researchers wrote the final versions of\u000d\u000a      Paragraph 82 articles (ii), (vii)\u000d\u000a      and (viii) of the final ECOWAS Conflict Prevention Framework (source (v)),\u000d\u000a      which became policy.\u000d\u000a      These researchers were subsequently invited to prepare a Plan of Action\u000d\u000a      for implementation,\u000d\u000a      which was presented to and adopted by the Framework's Coordination\u000d\u000a      Committee in January\u000d\u000a      2010.

King's has assisted in this process by training young African\u000d\u000a      women in peace and\u000d\u000a      security under the ECOWAS-King's Memorandum of Understanding and placing\u000d\u000a      them in ECOWAS\u000d\u000a      and other institutions (Source (ii), paras. 5, 6 and 8; Sources (vii),\u000d\u000a      Annex I, Items 20 and 21, and\u000d\u000a      (viii), Annex II, Item 6, give examples of these placements).\u000d\u000a    In February 2012, the ECOWAS Gender and Human Development Department\u000d\u000a      Director\u000d\u000a      approached King's to support implementation of the Plan of Action. King's\u000d\u000a      started work in\u000d\u000a      partnership with ECOWAS (and other international bodies) by creating a\u000d\u000a      programme to educate\u000d\u000a      and train women in matters of peace and security, and to give them\u000d\u000a      practical experience working in\u000d\u000a      one of these organisations. An official Strategic Overview in 2013 noted\u000d\u000a      that the Plan of Action\u000d\u000a      prepared by King's had been `widely disseminated and utilized in ECOWAS\u000d\u000a      member states' and\u000d\u000a      that the associated research `used within ECOWAS institutions, national\u000d\u000a      governments and civil\u000d\u000a      society in West Africa.'

By\u000d\u000a      July 2013, 41 women\u000d\u000a      have benefitted from this scheme and (a double impact) have worked on\u000d\u000a      making policies.

Formally, ECOWAS defined youth as 15-24 years old, in\u000d\u000a      line with Western and\u000d\u000a      international approaches, but out of line with cultural experience in\u000d\u000a      Africa and African Union policy.\u000d\u000a      It was important to address vulnerability and the risk of social\u000d\u000a      discontent and unrest, in a situation\u000d\u000a      where regional needs meant that `youth' policy and practices needed to be\u000d\u000a      extended to 25-35-year\u000d\u000a      olds to reduce pressures for violence, and for positive development, peace\u000d\u000a      and security. The\u000d\u000a      research finding indicated that youth policy was not, therefore, reaching\u000d\u000a      much of the real youth. As\u000d\u000a      a result, there was a spread of alienation with the potential for\u000d\u000a      radicalisation and violence that\u000d\u000a      ECOWAS needed to change.

This research sought to\u000d\u000a      respond to a policy\u000d\u000a      challenge as well as a critical gap in knowledge framed in 2000, by United\u000d\u000a      Nations Security\u000d\u000a      Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. Among other\u000d\u000a      things, UNSCR\u000d\u000a      1325 called for an increase in representation of women at decision-making\u000d\u000a      levels in the systems\u000d\u000a      and structures that deal with conflict resolution and management at\u000d\u000a      national, regional and\u000d\u000a      international levels; and to increase women's participation in field based\u000d\u000a      operations. This research,\u000d\u000a      involved in-depth semi-structured interviews to examine the application of\u000d\u000a      UNSCR 1325 in 8\u000d\u000a      countries and 4 regional organizations, including ECOWAS.

In response, the European Commission agreed on 15 recommendations in\u000a      a Communication\u000a      adopted in May 2008 [2] and whose implementation was monitored in a\u000a      progress report (source\u000a      [3]). Nine of these recommendations, including the most central ones, are\u000a      virtually identical to the\u000a      recommendations made in the report, three are closely related, while three\u000a      are new (sources [3] &amp;\u000a      [4]). As discussed below, the report also influenced the Commission's\u000a      first Corporate\u000a      Communication Statement of 2009 (source [6]). This meant that the research\u000a      had a significant\u000a      impact on the communication activities of more than 1900 officials and\u000a      &#8364;250 million annually\u000a      spending on communication activities targeted more than 500 million EU\u000a      citizens as well as some\u000a      foreign publics. It also impinged at least indirectly on the intensified\u000a      cooperation with member\u000a      states as 14 new management partnerships were concluded between 2007 and\u000a      2009 (up from 3)\u000a      (source [7]). Specific impact can be seen in the following areas:\u000a    (A) One central recommendation of the report was the creation of a\u000a      communication steering board\u000a      (R3) to address the problem of insufficient top-level coordination. In\u000a      response, a communication\u000a      steering board was created, which meets on a weekly basis and identifies\u000a      the challenges at stake\u000a      with a regular participation of the secretary general of the Commission\u000a      (source [4]). More broadly,\u000a      the Corporate Communication Statement of 2009 elevates the strategic\u000a      importance of\u000a      communication as integral to the institution's mission (reflecting closely\u000a      the wording and thrust of\u000a      the introduction to the recommendations R3 to R5) and clarifies the\u000a      respective roles of the\u000a      Commissioner's Cabinets, Spokesperson's service, DG COMM, the\u000a      Representations and line DGs.\u000a    (B) The study also recommended reducing the number of annual Commission\u000a      communication\u000a      priorities, which amounted to 19 in 2007. It advised that \"in an ideal\u000a      scenario, the Commission\u000a      would adopt no more than five communication priorities. A small number of\u000a      priorities will make it\u000a      more likely that the priority status can translate into a meaningful\u000a      allocation of resources.\u000a      Moreover, the objectives should be more clearly elaborated in terms of\u000a      intended effects and based\u000a      on genuine research of stakeholders, including targeted surveys of the\u000a      various publics' interest in\u000a      and need for information about specific issues\". The reduction of\u000a      priorities was mentioned as a key\u000a      goal in the implementation report [3] and was implemented gradually from 7\u000a      (2007), to 2 (2009),\u000a      and 3 (2010), not counting inter-institutional priorities. The\u000a      implementation report also echoes the\u000a      report's language as the \"definition [of priorities] should be based on\u000a      research among stakeholders,\u000a      including targeted surveys of the various audiences\" (source [3]).\u000a    (C) Thirteen of the report's recommendations (primarily R43-50, but also\u000a      R10-12) focused explicitly\u000a      on different ways in which EU representations communication activities\u000a      could be strengthened,\u000a      most importantly by giving them additional resources for a range of tasks,\u000a      some short, others more\u000a      long-term. The report thus helped to make the case for continuing an\u000a      already existing pilot-scheme\u000a      for some key representations and extending it further political reporting\u000a      level and contacts with the\u000a      media (source [4]). The progress report highlights as a corporate\u000a      objective to redeploy 10 percent\u000a      of the posts currently devoted to communication activities and make them\u000a      available to the\u000a      Representations, to corporate communication activities, and to the general\u000a      redeployment pool [3].\u000a      This resulted in the redeployment of 5 posts to representations and 25\u000a      translation posts to support\u000a      the `going local' (report's recommendations R2, R43 and R50).\u000a    (D) In order to address the substantial skills shortage across the\u000a      Commission given the legacy of\u000a      institutional neglect, the report made a number of recommendations\u000a      (R27-30) to improve the\u000a      professionalization of communication through training and career\u000a      progression as well as through\u000a      targeted recruitment of communication specialists. This translated\u000a      directly into the Commission's\u000a      overarching recommendation 9 \"Develop Communication Skills\" and specific\u000a      recommendations\u000a      focused on an increased range of tailored staff training with both short\u000a      and long-term opportunities\u000a      (e.g. `part-time degrees') and the need to make training sessions\u000a      sufficiently attractive in terms of\u000a      career progression and time-management (source [3]). As a result a working\u000a      Group within DG\u000a      COMM has been set up to develop training paths per job function in the\u000a      area of communication of\u000a      DG COMM and to develop a 'communication professionalization programme' for\u000a      the whole\u000a      Commission. In order to recruit more communication specialists DG COMM\u000a      organised a\u000a      competition for a temporary posts (33T\/COMM\/08), and further competitions\u000a      were run for a number\u000a      of posts in 2008 on \"Information, Communication and Media\" (EPSO\/AD\/94\/07)\u000a      at AD5 level and in\u000a      2009 on \"Communication et information\" organised at AST3 level\u000a      (Competition EPSO\/AST\/37\/07).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken by Christoph Meyer has had a direct impact on the\u000a      European Commission's\u000a      external communication policy, structures and capacities, particularly in\u000a      2008 and 2009.

The main study was commissioned by\u000a      the European\u000a      Commission's Directorate-General for Communication (DG COMM) and took\u000a      place between May\u000a      and October 2007. It gave Meyer and his co-authors, Kurpas and Br&#252;ggemann,\u000a      extraordinary\u000a      access to internal documents and officials in Brussels and key national\u000a      capitals. The study\u000a      proceeded on the basis of a rigorous methodology reflecting the state of\u000a      the art in evaluating\u000a      communication activities. Amongst the study's 25 separate findings, the\u000a      following are the most\u000a      significant:\u000a    - The EU Commission suffers from a legacy of institutional neglect for\u000a      external communication\u000a      visible in resourcing, recruitment, training and career progress of\u000a      officials working on\u000a      communication. The quality of the staff active in communication is key to\u000a      working efficiently with\u000a      resources and maximising impact, but the institution is suffering from a\u000a      skills gap in areas such as\u000a      marketing and PR, planning, web-design and web-journalism. There are\u000a      hardly any officials with a\u000a      background in communication studies widely defined and those who do work\u000a      in this area cannot\u000a      use their skills to the best advantage given considerable administrative\u000a      duties. Finally,\u000a      communication skills and performance are not yet sufficiently recognised\u000a      and rewarded by DG and\u000a      the institution, leading to recruitment and retention problems.\u000a    - The institution suffers from an overly cautious approach to external\u000a      communication shaped by\u000a      defensive attitude towards political discourse and advocacy, rather than\u000a      engaging in supposedly\u000a      neutral technocratic information of citizens and stakeholders. In many\u000a      cases, DGs formulated their\u000a      objectives in terms of uncontroversial communication output or activities\u000a      (`to communicate', `to\u000a      inform', and `to publicise') rather than in relation to intended effects\u000a      on particular target audiences.\u000a    - The report noted the fragmentation of communication activities between\u000a      DGs and\u000a      Commissioners, aggravated by insufficient coordination and strategic\u000a      guidance from the College of\u000a      Commissioners. There are too many and too unspecific annual communication\u000a      priorities. When\u000a      comparing the alignment of DGs communication objectives with the\u000a      Commission's overall\u000a      priorities, the study found that some thematic priorities were\u000a      oversubscribed, while others were\u000a      hardly covered at all. This meant that the priorities of the individual\u000a      DGs and of the Commission as\u000a      a whole were not sufficiently in sync.\u000a    - External communication was insufficiently tailored towards\u000a      national\/regional audiences, raising\u000a      the risks of messages being misunderstood and problems for policies not\u000a      spotted early enough in a\u000a      diverse Union of nearly 500 million citizens. Generally, resources for\u000a      \"going local\" were inadequate\u000a      and spread too thinly across DGs. There was too little reflection on\u000a      whether and how \"the general\u000a      public\" can be targeted with the resources available.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41255","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Pant's published work on India's changing foreign and security policy has\u000d\u000a      attracted wide attention in India and in particular, the US where a\u000d\u000a      reinvention of the US-India partnership is underway. The US-India nuclear\u000d\u000a      pact was one of the most significant foreign policy moves made by the\u000d\u000a      George W. Bush Administration to strengthen the partnership with India.\u000d\u000a      But it was a highly contentious move and provoked a lot of debate in India\u000d\u000a      and in Washington. Pant was involved in this debate through his extensive\u000d\u000a      writings in the Indian and global media (ref (b)). His research on the\u000d\u000a      role of China and the changing regional balance of power was one of the\u000d\u000a      factors that ultimately emerged as a reason for the dampening of\u000d\u000a      opposition to the nuclear deal in New Delhi and Washington.\u000d\u000a    His book, Contemporary Debates in Indian Foreign and Security Policy\u000d\u000a      (ref (a)), was a required reading for senior members of the US President\u000d\u000a      Barack Obama's team during his visit to India in November 2011 (email\u000d\u000a      communication from a former US State Department official). A number of\u000d\u000a      issues raised in the book as significant for US-India ties were reflected\u000d\u000a      in the Obama Administration's outreach to New Delhi. These include\u000d\u000a      America's open support for India's permanent membership in the UN Security\u000d\u000a      Council, the downgrading of the role of Iran in US-India ties and the\u000d\u000a      centrality of China in Indian foreign policy. Pant was invited by the US\u000d\u000a      State Department to brief the US Ambassador-Designate to India in February\u000d\u000a      2012. He was also asked to attend a US-India strategic dialogue organised\u000d\u000a      by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI),\u000d\u000a      which is the largest association of business organizations in India.\u000d\u000a    India's ties with Iran became a major stumbling block in New Delhi's\u000d\u000a      attempt to enter into a nuclear rapprochement with Washington. Pant's\u000d\u000a      research into this vital relationship (ref (c)) sheds new light on the\u000d\u000a      underlying weaknesses of this relationship and continues to shape policy\u000d\u000a      thinking in Washington on this score. Pant was requested to write a\u000d\u000a      briefing for the India Caucus in the US Senate. Evidence of the impact of\u000d\u000a      Pant's research can be found in the way in which senior officials of the\u000d\u000a      Obama Administration, including the Secretary of State and the US\u000d\u000a      Ambassador to India have dealt with the issue of India-Iran relations by\u000d\u000a      underscoring that contrary to media portrayals, India-Iran relations are\u000d\u000a      very close.\u000d\u000a    According to most political observers, the centre of gravity of global\u000d\u000a      politics is shifting from the Atlantic to the Pacific in recent years with\u000d\u000a      the rise of China and India, gradual assertion by Japan of its military\u000d\u000a      profile, and a significant shift in the US global force posture in favour\u000d\u000a      of the Asia-Pacific. The world seems to be entering into a \"post-American\"\u000d\u000a      era and the international system is trying to come to grips with the rise\u000d\u000a      of China and all that it implies for global peace and stability. India and\u000d\u000a      China are two major powers in Asia with global aspirations and some\u000d\u000a      significant conflicting interests. As a result, some amount of friction in\u000d\u000a      their bilateral relationship is inevitable. Pant's research on this very\u000d\u000a      important bilateral relationship (ref (a) and (d)) has led to commissioned\u000d\u000a      media writings, media comments and briefings to the various arms of the\u000d\u000a      US, the UK and the Indian government. Pant's contributions on the future\u000d\u000a      of US-China-India triangle have shaped the policy debate in China as\u000d\u000a      reflected in the commentary in state-owned media outlets.\u000d\u000a    Pant's research on the impact of the war in Afghanistan (ref (e)) on\u000d\u000a      Indian security resulted in his views being sought by various governments\u000d\u000a      and the US Army War College's Strategic Studies Institute funding. He was\u000d\u000a      invited to address the Cabinet Office Annual Conference in 2009 on this\u000d\u000a      issue and was invited to be a part of the report on Afghanistan in 2009 by\u000d\u000a      the Swedish Defence Research Agency, the research arm of the Swedish\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Defence. He was then invited by the Swedish Defence Research\u000d\u000a      Agency to a follow-up policy roundtable on Afghanistan-post-2014. Pant's\u000d\u000a      research has highlighted how New Delhi's own inability to articulate its\u000d\u000a      policy position on Afghanistan has led to its marginalisation in the\u000d\u000a      evolving policy frameworks of the West vis-a-vis Afghanistan. Pant's\u000d\u000a      suggestion that India will have to up its game in Afghanistan if it wants\u000d\u000a      to retain any credibility in post-2014 scenario was reflected in the\u000d\u000a      signing of the Strategic Partnership agreement between New Delhi and\u000d\u000a      Kabul.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research undertaken by Dr. Harsh Pant has examined the cause and\u000d\u000a      consequences of India's rise as a global power.

This research has involved close engagement\u000d\u000a      with stakeholders and extensive field research by Pant in India and the\u000d\u000a      United States. The research produced insights on how Indian policy-makers\u000d\u000a      are trying to use their new-found global heft in bilateral and\u000d\u000a      multilateral fora; how India is interacting with major global powers such\u000d\u000a      as the US and China; and what are the constraints that still inhibit India\u000d\u000a      from achieving its full potential on the global stage with its\u000d\u000a      implications for global balance of power.\u000d\u000a    There has been a growing discussion in academic and policy circles about\u000d\u000a      the rise of India as a global power. Pant's insights provide a detailed\u000d\u000a      assessment of the changing Indian foreign policy in various dimensions,\u000d\u000a      producing analyses that underline how a rising India is dealing with major\u000d\u000a      global issues and relationships in a significantly different manner than\u000d\u000a      in the past. Pant's research has shown how India will follow a\u000d\u000a      significantly different policy trajectory in global politics compared to\u000d\u000a      other major powers of the past and present. His research has underlined\u000d\u000a      the centrality of China as well as domestic political and institutional\u000d\u000a      constraints in shaping Indian foreign policy priorities, especially in so\u000d\u000a      far as New Delhi's burgeoning ties with Washington are concerned. These\u000d\u000a      factors have been critical in the manner US-India ties have evolved over\u000d\u000a      the last two decades, first generating euphoria and then leading to\u000d\u000a      disappointment about the trajectory of the relationship. Pant's research\u000d\u000a      on the US-India civil nuclear energy pact has underlined the role of\u000d\u000a      structural factors suggesting that the rise of China and the need to\u000d\u000a      manage China's rise in Asia was one of the most significant reasons why\u000d\u000a      New Delhi and Washington decided to undertake the civilian nuclear energy\u000d\u000a      cooperation deal despite strong opposition in the domestic polity of both\u000d\u000a      nations.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41257","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The first major report by ICSR, launched in Feb. 2009 on the subject of\u000d\u000a      online radicalisation,\u000d\u000a      helped inform UK government thinking on a new area of concern. On 17 Feb.\u000d\u000a      2009, Neumann met\u000d\u000a      with the then UK Home Secretary Jacqui Smith to brief her about the key\u000d\u000a      findings.

There was a further briefing with senior\u000d\u000a      civil servants from the UK\u000d\u000a      Home Office on 2 March, and on 12 March there was an Early Day Motion in\u000d\u000a      the House of\u000d\u000a      Commons recommending that the government take up the four main\u000d\u000a      recommendations proposed\u000d\u000a      by ICSR.\u000d\u000a    ICSR's research has also informed parliamentary scrutiny of government\u000d\u000a      policy. On 1 June 2010,\u000d\u000a      ICSR launched a report on prison radicalisation which was jointly funded\u000d\u000a      by the UK Home Office,\u000d\u000a      Australian Foreign Office, the National Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism\u000d\u000a      Netherlands, and the US\u000d\u000a      Department of Homeland Security. On 30 November 2011, Richard Pickering,\u000d\u000a      Head of the Security\u000d\u000a      Group in UK Prisons, was questioned extensively at a UK Home Affairs\u000d\u000a      Select Committee Inquiry\u000d\u000a      on the Roots of Radicalisation about the findings of the ICSR report on\u000d\u000a      prisons, and the problems\u000d\u000a      that it highlighted. On 6 December 2011, Neumann also gave evidence before\u000d\u000a      the same Home\u000d\u000a      Affairs committee about the report.\u000d\u000a    ICSR's research was prominent in the review and revision of the UK\u000d\u000a      official strategy for Preventing\u000d\u000a      Radicalisation that was undertaken by the government in 2011. In June\u000d\u000a      2011, both ICSR's reports\u000d\u000a      on online radicalisation and on prison radicalisation were cited in the\u000d\u000a      revised official strategy for\u000d\u000a      Preventing Violent Radicalisation, alongside an earlier report co-written\u000d\u000a      by Neumann and ICSR\u000d\u000a      Associate Fellow Brooke Rogers on Recruitment and Mobilisation for the\u000d\u000a        Islamist Militant\u000d\u000a        Movement.\u000d\u000a    Our impact has also been notable outside the UK. Peter Neumann presented\u000d\u000a      the findings of the\u000d\u000a      report on online radicalisation at a meeting with the German Federal\u000d\u000a      Criminal Office (BKA) in Berlin\u000d\u000a      on 25 February 2009 and then at a Council of Europe Conference on\u000d\u000a      Terrorism and Cyber Security\u000d\u000a      in Madrid on 16 April 2009 (after which the report's findings were\u000d\u000a      included in the resolutions of the\u000d\u000a      conference). Our 2010 report on prison radicalisation informed: a review\u000d\u000a      of procedures for holding\u000d\u000a      terrorist prisoners in the Dutch prison system (Dr. Hans van Miert of the\u000d\u000a      Dutch National\u000d\u000a      Counterterrorism Coordinator stated it was `influential we were\u000d\u000a      considering changes to our\u000d\u000a      detention system for terrorist prisoners in 2010-2011'); the US State\u000d\u000a      Department's outreach and\u000d\u000a      training for foreign partners on de-radicalisation and prison\u000d\u000a      radicalisation (Michael Jacobson of the\u000d\u000a      U.S. State Department Bureau of Counterterrorism stated it was `helpful in\u000d\u000a      shaping my thinking on\u000d\u000a      the subject'); and the Australian Dept. of Justice's Intervention\u000d\u000a      Programmes to deal with radicalised\u000d\u000a      prisoners (Australian Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism, Bill Paterson\u000d\u000a      stated it had been `used by\u000d\u000a      the State Government of Victoria in the development of rehabiltation\u000d\u000a      programs for convicted\u000d\u000a      terrorists currently in detention in Victoria' and circulated to other\u000d\u000a      state authorities).\u000d\u000a    An important aspect of ICSR's work has been to draw on the UK example to\u000d\u000a      inform efforts by other\u000d\u000a      governments to develop prevent strategies for violent extremism. In late\u000d\u000a      2010, Neumann was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the Bi-Partisan Policy Center in Washington DC to write a\u000d\u000a      policy report on\u000d\u000a      Preventing Violent Radicalization in America: blueprint for a national\u000d\u000a        strategy in the United States,\u000d\u000a      alongside Lee Hamilton and Thomas Kean, former Co-Chairs of the 9\/11\u000d\u000a      Commission. Following\u000d\u000a      the report's publication, Neumann testified before the US House Select\u000d\u000a      Subcommittee on\u000d\u000a      Terrorism on 27 July 2011 and most of the recommendations made in the\u000d\u000a      report were incorporated\u000d\u000a      in the US government's subsequent Strategic Implementation Plan for\u000d\u000a        Empowering Local Partners\u000d\u000a        to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States. This included\u000d\u000a      recommendations on the structure\u000d\u000a      and scope of counter-radicalisation efforts, their organisation within\u000d\u000a      government, and the\u000d\u000a      separation between community policing and counter-radicalisation, which\u000d\u000a      the ICSR strongly\u000d\u000a      emphasised. Indeed, we were subsequently informed by Arif Alikhan, former\u000d\u000a      Assistant Secretary of\u000d\u000a      Homeland Security, that the ICSR report was important in helping to\u000d\u000a      `adjust' and `fine tune' the\u000d\u000a      Department of Homeland Security's policy on counter-radicalisation.\u000d\u000a    Finally, as concerns about Far Right extremism have also grown in recent\u000d\u000a      years, ICSR's\u000d\u000a      pioneering work in this area has received attention from government.

In his address, he noted that `the International Centre for the Study\u000d\u000a      of Radicalisation has a first\u000d\u000a      class reputation in the field of counter-terrorism studies'.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The research of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation\u000d\u000a      and Political Violence\u000d\u000a      (ICSR) has had an impact on approaches to counter-terrorism and\u000d\u000a      de-radicalisation, primarily in\u000d\u000a      the United Kingdom but also in the European Union, United States of\u000d\u000a      America, and Australia.

This research focus\u000d\u000a      corresponds with the\u000d\u000a      priorities identified in the UK government's 2010 national security\u000d\u000a      strategy, A Strong Britain in an\u000d\u000a        Age of Security: The National Security Strategy (in which Al\u000d\u000a      Qaeda-inspired and Northern Ireland-related\u000d\u000a      terrorism were identified as `Tier One' threats) and CONTEST &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      Government's counter-terrorism\u000d\u000a      strategy &#8212; which was revised and updated in June 2011 to encompass\u000d\u000a      Far-Right\u000d\u000a      extremism (ref. b, c, d, e and f below).\u000d\u000a    Since 2005, Western governments &#8212; led by the United Kingdom &#8212; started\u000d\u000a      implementing counter-radicalisation\u000d\u000a      programmes whose principal purpose was to complement traditional\u000d\u000a      counterterrorism efforts with a preventative component. In publishing\u000d\u000a      several reports on aspects of\u000d\u000a      radicalisation and counter-radicalisation, ICSR made an important\u000d\u000a      contribution to anchoring this\u000d\u000a      new area of policy practice in a body of scholarship and giving it\u000d\u000a      empirical and conceptual\u000d\u000a      grounding. Research by ICSR has helped establish the concept of\u000d\u000a      counter-radicalisation\u000d\u000a      (distinguishing it from counter-terrorism, de-radicalisation,\u000d\u000a      disengagement, community policing,\u000d\u000a      and other related concepts) and create awareness of key dilemmas and\u000d\u000a      trade-offs (for example,\u000d\u000a      the relationship between violent and non-violent extremism, and the\u000d\u000a      dynamics of radicalisation and\u000d\u000a      counter-radicalisation in online environments).\u000d\u000a    The central debate in all the scholarship on Islamist-inspired and\u000d\u000a      Far-Right radicalisation is the\u000d\u000a      nature of the relationship between extreme ideas and violent actions (ref.\u000d\u000a      b). A major concern for\u000d\u000a      policymakers and researchers has been on identifying how, why and when\u000d\u000a      certain individuals\u000d\u000a      make the leap from holding radical ideas into actual acts of violence.\u000d\u000a      ICSR's overall conclusion is\u000d\u000a      that it is futile to search for a precise `jump off' point between the\u000d\u000a      two. This has been reflected in\u000d\u000a      our policy recommendations for government across all of our reports (ref.\u000d\u000a      a and e) and it is a\u000d\u000a      conclusion now largely accepted by policy makers and civil servants.\u000d\u000a    ICSR's contribution to thinking in this field can be broken down further\u000d\u000a      into a number of more\u000d\u000a      specific areas of focus. These include assessments of: existing theories\u000d\u000a      of radicalisation (ref. a);\u000d\u000a      the role of the internet in facilitating violent radicalisation and what\u000d\u000a      can be done about it (ref. c and\u000d\u000a      e); the problem of radicalisation in prisons (ref. d); Al Qaeda's\u000d\u000a      English-language media strategy\u000d\u000a      (ref. c); strategies used by extremist groups to recruit supporters; and\u000d\u000a      the narratives and networks\u000d\u000a      which underpin the emergence of a new `Far Right' movement in the UK (ref.\u000d\u000a      f).\u000d\u000a    Growing out of this, another dimension of ICSR's work has been its\u000d\u000a      evaluation of recent and\u000d\u000a      existing government policy. Significant here is Neumann's report on Preventing\u000d\u000a        Violent\u000d\u000a        Radicalisation in America (ref. a and e), which examined British\u000d\u000a      experiences of counter-radicalisation\u000d\u000a      programmes in order to inform the US government's strategy for dealing\u000d\u000a      with this\u000d\u000a      problem. The report emphasised the sharing of best practices to inform the\u000d\u000a      (then) emerging debate\u000d\u000a      about domestic counter-radicalisation in the United States. It contained\u000d\u000a      chapters on European\u000d\u000a      experiences in counter-radicalisation, focusing specifically on the United\u000d\u000a      Kingdom and the\u000d\u000a      Netherlands. The US government's policy, published in August 2011,\u000d\u000a      reflected key conclusions of\u000d\u000a      the report.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41258","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Members of FORESIGHT were invited to co-chair (Meyer) and co-ordinate (de\u000d\u000a      Franco) the work of an expert task force on how the strengthen the EU's\u000d\u000a      capacities to prevent mass atrocities and genocide. This task force work\u000d\u000a      was initiated by the Budapest Centre for the International Prevention for\u000d\u000a      Genocide, a newly created NGO and chaired by a former official of the\u000d\u000a      Council of Ministers. The final report identified core problems impeding\u000d\u000a      the ability of the EU and its member states to prevent mass atrocities and\u000d\u000a      made a number of recommendations to address them. In particular, its first\u000d\u000a      substantive chapter on warning and response was closely informed by\u000d\u000a      Foresight research and to a large degree written by Meyer and de Franco,\u000d\u000a      but research also influenced other parts of the report as warning and\u000d\u000a      response are closely linked (see source [1]).\u000d\u000a    The process of drafting the report attracted considerable interest,\u000d\u000a      advice and feedback from the policy community in Brussels and national\u000d\u000a      capitals in the run-up to and at three major workshops in Berlin, Paris\u000d\u000a      and Brussels (source [8]). A draft of the Task Force's report was\u000d\u000a      circulated widely throughout relevant units in the European External\u000d\u000a      Action Service and some EU member states' foreign ministries in December\u000d\u000a      2012, resulting in substantive feedback on the report's conclusions.\u000d\u000a      Similarly, the European Parliament's rapporteur on the `Responsibility to\u000d\u000a      Protect' (R2P) commented on the TF report and used it to inform the\u000d\u000a      Parliament's own resolution, which was adopted in April 2013 (source [5]).\u000d\u000a      The resolution recommended, for instance, \"to strengthen linkages between\u000d\u000a      early warning, policy planning and high-level decision-making in the EEAS\u000d\u000a      and the Council\" (1-f) which is a verbatim passage suggested to the\u000d\u000a      Rapporteur by the Director of RG FORESIGHT in an email (source [6]). These\u000d\u000a      suggestions were also taken up when the EP resolution stresses the need,\u000d\u000a      to \"include a systematic assessment of the risk factors of genocide, war\u000d\u000a      crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity in regional and\u000d\u000a      country strategy papers\" (1-g) and \"to ensure that EU Special\u000d\u000a      Representatives uphold R2P whenever necessary and broaden the mandate of\u000d\u000a      the EU Special Representative on Human Rights to include R2P issues\"\u000d\u000a      (1-h).\u000d\u000a    The final report was endorsed in writing and in person by leading\u000d\u000a      practitioners in the field such as the former EU-Commissioner and current\u000d\u000a      Italian Foreign Minister, Emma Bonino, Elmar Brok, Chair of the European\u000d\u000a      Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, and the former UN Deputy\u000d\u000a      Secretary-General Lord Malloch-Brown (source [1]). Moreover, the current\u000d\u000a      UN Special Advisor on Genocide Adam Dieng attended the launch and praised\u000d\u000a      the report as a `fabulous contribution' toward the strengthening the\u000d\u000a      prevention of mass atrocities (source [2]). The Chair of the UK's All\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary Group on Genocide Prevention wrote to the Foreign &amp;\u000d\u000a      Commonwealth Office in support of the report. In response, FCO Minister\u000d\u000a      Simmonds confirmed that FCO officials had been `closely engaged with the\u000d\u000a      process of finalising the report' and `agreed' with much of its\u000d\u000a      recommendations, specifically `strengthening the EU's warning response'\u000d\u000a      (source [11]). The report was downloaded almost 50,000 times, featured in\u000d\u000a      media reports and welcomed by NGOs as strengthening their advocacy in the\u000d\u000a      field (source [3] &amp; [10]). Some of our recommendations, for instance\u000d\u000a      on recruitment of country experts from outside of government, were\u000d\u000a      subsequently taken-up by NGO in the field such as the European\u000d\u000a      Peacebuilding Liaison Office (EPLO), an umbrella organisation of 32 NGOs,\u000d\u000a      networks of NGOs and think-tanks from 14 European countries (source [7]).\u000d\u000a      Similarly, a briefing paper emerging from an Expert Roundtable on R2P\u000d\u000a      organised by the United Nations Association in the UK in April 2013\u000d\u000a      reflected key insights about the `[t]he packaging of information,\u000d\u000a      credibility of the source, the access and empowerment of the \"warner\"' in\u000d\u000a      its analysis and recommendations (source [10]).\u000d\u000a    Since its inception in 2008, FORESIGHT members closely collaborated with\u000d\u000a      EU and national officials active in shaping the organisation's emerging\u000d\u000a      warning and intelligence structures. The former head of the EU\u000d\u000a      intelligence hub, William Shapcott, (SITCEN, 2001-2010), joined the\u000d\u000a      Foresight advisory board and made clear at various meetings that exposure\u000d\u000a      to Foresight's findings helped him to reflect on and develop effective\u000d\u000a      communication of warnings within the EU context. This included\u000d\u000a      pre-announcing warning products, making clear that they are warnings or\u000d\u000a      which parts of them include warning elements to avoid misunderstandings\u000d\u000a      and limit the possibility for blame-shifting. Mr Shapcott's reflections on\u000d\u000a      the specific challenges of warning in a multi-national settings and how to\u000d\u000a      address them are contained in a chapter he contributed to book (source\u000d\u000a      [4]). Foresight findings also strengthened internal advocacy for better\u000d\u000a      warning and preventive policy within the emerging organisational culture\u000d\u000a      and structures of the European External Action Service, the EU's new\u000d\u000a      diplomatic corps of 3000 officials drawn from EU Commission, Council and\u000d\u000a      member states.\u000d\u000a    Finally, FORESIGHT research influenced NGOs active in the field of early\u000d\u000a      warning and peace-building. Foresight members were consulted by the PAX\u000d\u000a      project in the inception and feasibility phases. PAX is an NGO-start-up\u000d\u000a      supported, inter alia, by Google, which aims to use ICT to improve warning\u000d\u000a      performance about violent conflict. The FORESIGHT group advised against\u000d\u000a      placing the emphasis on advocacy for action as this was already done\u000d\u000a      better by other organisations (ICG) and to concentrate on those areas\u000d\u000a      where they could add most value. This recommendation was taken-up.\u000d\u000a      FORESIGHT members also highlighted the importance of source credibility\u000d\u000a      and expert evaluators of the data and highlighted the unintended\u000d\u000a      consequences\/potential abuses of new communication technology in warning\u000d\u000a      about violent conflict.

It generated the following\u000d\u000a      findings:\u000d\u000a    (A) FORESIGHT studied the much lamented warning-response gap in conflict\u000d\u000a      prevention. It found that the wide-spread belief among scholars and\u000d\u000a      practitioners that political will, rather than the quality and quantity of\u000d\u000a      warning, explains the warning-response gap is simplistic and &#8212; in the\u000d\u000a      paradigmatic case of Rwanda &#8212; plain wrong. The FORESIGHT team suggested a\u000d\u000a      more nuanced way to measure warning impact and developed a more\u000d\u000a      appropriate yardstick to measure whether a warning-response problem\u000d\u000a      exists. To explain why warnings are being noticed the group emphasises the\u000d\u000a      importance of organizational culture and relationships between producers\u000d\u000a      and consumers of warning as one of the most important factors as to\u000d\u000a      whether warnings are being recognized; far more important than message\u000d\u000a      properties. The content of the warning message could boost impact, but\u000d\u000a      only if certain sources had a chance to be noticed in the first place,\u000d\u000a      making the warning response process people-centred. The most important\u000d\u000a      source in this respect were senior officials who had recently been in the\u000d\u000a      country in question and who were considered by recipients as part of the\u000d\u000a      `in-group', i.e. someone with a similar ideological background and some\u000d\u000a      personal connections to recipients. High-level diplomats with local\u000d\u000a      expertise and political clout were the most powerful warners. Signals from\u000d\u000a      the bureaucratic and political leadership do matter, but incentives on\u000d\u000a      leaders to respond can and do change, partly as a result of mediatised\u000d\u000a      warnings and advocacy for preventive action.\u000d\u000a    (B) With regard to the EU, the researchers found that it has considerable\u000d\u000a      potential to make preventive action a hallmark of its approach to\u000d\u000a      international security, violent conflict and human rights protection,\u000d\u000a      particularly after the creation of the European External Action Service\u000d\u000a      (EEAS). It has, however, fallen significantly short in translating these\u000d\u000a      aspirations into institutional practice and success on the ground. Its\u000d\u000a      long-term policy instruments are not sufficiently geared towards\u000d\u000a      identifying and addressing risks of violent conflict and genocide, whereas\u000d\u000a      its action to address medium to short-term risks is substantially slowed\u000d\u000a      down by the diversion of institutional resources and political attention\u000d\u000a      to the management of immediate or current crises. The EEAS in its current\u000d\u000a      form could lead to lower receptivity and slower responses due to growing\u000d\u000a      information noise, excessively hierarchical relations, role confusion and\u000d\u000a      fragmentation as well as an even tighter bottleneck in information\u000d\u000a      processing and decision-making at the top of the broader pyramidal\u000d\u000a      structure. The FORESIGHT group has produced several recommendations to\u000d\u000a      address these shortcomings, including, strengthening the linkage between\u000d\u000a      warning-producers, policy-planners and high-level decision-makers,\u000d\u000a      integrating warning and response capacities through EU Special\u000d\u000a      Representatives and devolving some power to respond downwards, enabling\u000d\u000a      fast-tracking of warnings and empowering warning sources through training\u000d\u000a      and career incentives.\u000d\u000a    (C) With regard to publicly communicated warning, FORESIGHT found that\u000d\u000a      qualitative warnings communicated by NGOs such as the International Crisis\u000d\u000a      Group and journalists writing for quality news media, had a considerably\u000d\u000a      higher impact than watch-lists and other formal warning products produced\u000d\u000a      by intelligence analysts. On the other hand, warnings are often\u000d\u000a      communicated far too late and in a hedged way as journalists cling to\u000d\u000a      objective reporting roles, whereas NGOs are anxious to maximize impact and\u000d\u000a      protect their reputation. It was also found that NGOs are overusing a\u000d\u000a      humanitarian frame, which is considered less helpful or in some cases\u000d\u000a      counter-productive to getting warnings noticed, particularly at the early\u000d\u000a      stage by international organizations or Western governments. Many NGOs in\u000d\u000a      this area harm their reputation for good analysis by formulating\u000d\u000a      recommendations that are seen unrealistic or ill-informed by\u000d\u000a      decision-makers. Hence, the RG has produced a briefing paper tailored to\u000d\u000a      NGOs to advise them on how to build a positive track-record and reputation\u000d\u000a      with potential recipients of warnings, how improve the warning message and\u000d\u000a      when to better avoid making recommendations and concentrate on analysis.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42015","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2562770","Name":"Malta"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Nature of the Impact: The influence of MSU's research on EU\u000d\u000a      policymaking debate and practice on refugees can be traced through its\u000d\u000a      direct interactions with policymakers and in the way pre-legislative\u000d\u000a      policy reports have used its research findings. MSU's research has shaped\u000d\u000a      key debates on refuge protection in Europe. Some of its key policy\u000d\u000a      recommendations regarding the need for reformed burden-sharing policies\u000d\u000a      have been taken up by legislators. These reforms have started to\u000d\u000a      re-balance responsibilities across EU Member States and have been\u000d\u000a      acknowledged to have helped improve protection capacities in over-burdened\u000d\u000a      countries such as Greece [A]. In doing so, MSU's work has helped to\u000d\u000a      improve the chances of the tens of thousands refugees who come to Europe\u000d\u000a      each year to find effective protection from persecution.\u000d\u000a    i) Informing policy debate\u000d\u000a      In EU policymaking, research reports commissioned by EU institutions are\u000d\u000a      highly influential in the EU legislative process. They inform White and\u000d\u000a      Green papers through which they can influence legislative programmes and\u000d\u000a      ultimately new EU directives and regulations.\u000d\u000a      In recent years, the EU has commissioned three major research reports in\u000d\u000a      the area of migration management and refugee burden-sharing. Dr Thielemann\u000d\u000a      contributed to all three of these reports, as lead academic author for the\u000d\u000a      European Parliament's 2010 report [B]; as a member of the steering\u000d\u000a      committee of the European Commission's 2010 report, in which he was the\u000d\u000a      single most referenced author (21 separate references to six publications)\u000d\u000a      [C]. The report's conclusions supported Dr Thielemann's research findings\u000d\u000a      that policy harmonisation was insufficient by calling for an intra-EU\u000d\u000a      relocation pilot scheme for refugees [C, p.79,82]. In the third report, to\u000d\u000a      which Thielemann was also invited to contribute, three of Thielemann's\u000d\u000a      publications were referred to and the report's conclusions agreed with\u000d\u000a      Thielemann's call [3 in section 3 above] for stronger complementary\u000d\u000a      burden-sharing mechanisms and the expansion of a reformed European Refugee\u000d\u000a      Fund [D]\u000d\u000a    At the invitation of the Council of Ministers, Dr Thielemann served as a\u000d\u000a      Special Rapporteur for EU burden-sharing initiatives at its\u000d\u000a      inter-ministerial conference on Justice and Home Affairs in 2010 [E],\u000d\u000a      which led to a renewed impetus from the highest political level to address\u000d\u000a      solidarity issues in the negotiations of the EU's new legislative asylum\u000d\u000a      package [14]. He has given evidence on new physical relocation initiatives\u000d\u000a      to the all-party working group on asylum of the European Parliament and to\u000d\u000a      several workshops organised by the national contact points of the\u000d\u000a      intergovernmental European Migration Network, most recently hosted by the\u000d\u000a      Cypriot government [G].\u000d\u000a      Within the UK, two of Thielemann's publications on migration management\u000d\u000a      [1,2 in section 3 above] were specifically referred to by immigration\u000d\u000a      minister Phil Woolas in his written response to a parliamentary question\u000d\u000a      on asylum management in November 2009 [H]. In 2010, Thielemann was asked\u000d\u000a      by the UK Government's Chief Scientific Advisor to write a paper on the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of policy on migration flows for the Foresight report on\u000d\u000a      Global Environmental Migration [I] which the BBC referred to `the most\u000d\u000a      detailed study carried out on the effect of flooding, drought and rising\u000d\u000a      sea levels on human migration patterns over the next 50 years' [J].\u000d\u000a    ii) Impact on policies\u000d\u000a      Important shifts in the EU asylum policy debate in recent years have\u000d\u000a      incorporated some of MSU's key policy recommendations on EU\u000d\u000a      burden-sharing.\u000d\u000a    First, the European Commission and the Member States have increasingly\u000d\u000a      acknowledged the central role that structural pull factors play in\u000d\u000a      influencing the size and direction of asylum flows. In 2007, the European\u000d\u000a      Commission recognised publicly for the first time that `the establishment\u000d\u000a      of a common asylum procedure and a uniform status will not completely\u000d\u000a      eradicate all reasons why asylum seekers may find one Member State a more\u000d\u000a      attractive destination than another', and accepted that `thought should\u000d\u000a      mainly be given to establishing \"corrective\" burden-sharing mechanisms'\u000d\u000a      [K, p.11].\u000d\u000a    Second, the European Commission and Member States have responded to the\u000d\u000a      MSU's criticism of the insufficient size of the European Refugee Fund\u000d\u000a      (ERF). In its 2007 Green Paper, the Commission states: `We need to\u000d\u000a      consider ways of further maximising the effectiveness of the European\u000d\u000a      Refugee Fund (ERF) as a supporting instrument for Member States' efforts\u000d\u000a      to implement EU asylum policy... ways must be explored to ensure ERF\u000d\u000a      funding can be put to better use in order to complement, stimulate and act\u000d\u000a      as a catalyst for the delivery of the objectives pursued, to reduce\u000d\u000a      disparities and to raise standards' [K, p.11]. Since then, the ERF's\u000d\u000a      resources have been expanded from around &#8364;200 million to a budget of\u000d\u000a      &#8364;3,869 million for its successor, the Asylum and Migration Fund (AMF).\u000d\u000a      Europe's principal refugee NGO (ECRE) is using MSU research to lobby for\u000d\u000a      further reform, particularly of the Fund's allocation mechanisms, citing\u000d\u000a      Dr Thielemann's 2010 research for the EP [L].\u000d\u000a    Third, the EU's legislative bodies have reacted to the criticism of the\u000d\u000a      `Dublin mechanism', led by MSU, in adopting the reformed Dublin III\u000d\u000a      Regulation in 2012. Some Member States took up Dr Thielemann's\u000d\u000a      recommendation for more physical relocation mechanisms by establishing the\u000d\u000a      pilot scheme EUREMA, which led to refugees in Malta being relocated to\u000d\u000a      other Member States. The review of this scheme by the International\u000d\u000a      Organization for Migration (IOM) prominently acknowledged the contribution\u000d\u000a      of Thielemann's research in the report's foreword [M].\u000d\u000a    Fourth, MSU's promotion of new physical relocation instruments was picked\u000d\u000a      up by the `Alliance of Liberal and Democrats for Europe' (ALDE) party\u000d\u000a      group in the EP, which in September 2012 convened a special refugee\u000d\u000a      relocation conference with all stakeholder groups at the EP, inviting Dr\u000d\u000a      Thielemann as the principal academic keynote speaker. The meeting resulted\u000d\u000a      in a resolution by the EP plenary [N] that calls on the Commission to\u000d\u000a      include an \"EU distribution key\" for the physical relocation of\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries of international protection in its future legislative\u000d\u000a      proposals for new refugee burden-sharing instruments and a report with an\u000d\u000a      invited contribution by Dr Thielemann [O].\u000d\u000a    Wider Implications: Six million asylum seekers have entered Europe\u000d\u000a      over the past two decades. By helping to shift the debate on\u000d\u000a      burden-sharing, Dr Thielemann's research is helping some of the world's\u000d\u000a      most vulnerable individuals to find protection from persecution.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr Eiko Thielemann is Director of the LSE's Migration Studies Unit (MSU).\u000d\u000a      His research into asylum policy in the EU has shown that certain key\u000d\u000a      policies have undermined efforts to share responsibility for the over six\u000d\u000a      million asylum seekers that have entered Europe over the past two decades.\u000d\u000a      MSU's policy recommendations and Thielemann's involvement in the\u000d\u000a      policymaking process have helped shift the debate away from an\u000d\u000a      over-reliance on EU policy harmonisation towards the adoption of new\u000d\u000a      burden-sharing instruments.

IMPALA collects comparative data\u000d\u000a      on immigration and refugee policies and develops policy indices that have\u000d\u000a      enabled new research into the management of migration flows. MSU's\u000d\u000a      research on refugee burden-sharing in Europe has generated concrete policy\u000d\u000a      recommendations centred on three EU policy priorities: (i) regulatory\u000d\u000a      harmonisation (sharing policy); (ii) financial compensation (sharing\u000d\u000a      money) and iii) physical relocation (sharing people).\u000d\u000a    i) Regulatory harmonisation: The need for complementary burden-sharing\u000d\u000a        instruments\u000d\u000a      Dr Thielemann's research on the determinants of asylum flows has\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that the EU's attempts to achieve equitable refugee\u000d\u000a      burden-sharing through policy harmonisation has been fundamentally flawed.\u000d\u000a      The research found that even if Europe succeeded in harmonising national\u000d\u000a      policies, the unequal distribution of asylum burdens would persist given\u000d\u000a      differences in the `structural pull factors' of European states. Current\u000d\u000a      EU initiatives neglect the underlying causes of asylum and undermine\u000d\u000a      Member States' ability to use distinctive policy tools to counteract the\u000d\u000a      effect of structural factors that influence the distribution of burdens in\u000d\u000a      this area. By so doing, they tend to undermine rather than advance the\u000d\u000a      goal of equitable burden-sharing [1]. This research has established the\u000d\u000a      need for improved, complementary, burden-sharing initiatives for financial\u000d\u000a      and physical burden-sharing (relocation) [2].\u000d\u000a    ii) Financial burden-sharing: The need for a new European Refugee Fund\u000d\u000a      Dr Thielemann's analysis of the European Refugee Fund (ERF), led to the\u000d\u000a      publication of a special issue of the Journal of Common Market Studies,\u000d\u000a      which he co-edited [3] and a research report commissioned by the European\u000d\u000a      Parliament, which Thielemann co-authored [4]. This research found that the\u000d\u000a      ERF remains highly ineffective as a financial compensation mechanism, and\u000d\u000a      that its allocation rules restrict its burden-sharing impact and undermine\u000d\u000a      the fund's ability to encourage Member States to enhance their refugee\u000d\u000a      protection efforts [3]. On the basis of this finding, the EP report\u000d\u000a      proposed a reformed `capacity-based funding model' that would potentially\u000d\u000a      be more effective than a per application compensation mechanism. This work\u000d\u000a      argued that ultimately only the physical relocation of asylum seekers\u000d\u000a      would make a significant contribution to a more equitable distribution of\u000d\u000a      asylum costs across Member States [see also 6].\u000d\u000a    iii) Physical relocation: The need for a revised internal resettlement\u000d\u000a        mechanism\u000d\u000a      Research by Dr Thielemann has found that the EU's principal instrument for\u000d\u000a      the physical relocation of asylum seekers, the Dublin II Regulation,\u000d\u000a      encourages burden-shifting towards Member States located on the external\u000d\u000a      borders of the European Union, because it allocates the final\u000d\u000a      responsibility for asylum seekers to the country through which they first\u000d\u000a      entered the EU [5]. The research also warns against a reliance on\u000d\u000a      voluntary relocation mechanisms [2]. The ineffectiveness of such\u000d\u000a      instruments became tragically evident during the Libyan crisis,\u000d\u000a      reinforcing the MSU's findings that some form of automatic (binding)\u000d\u000a      relocation of refugees, based on Member States' capacities, is necessary\u000d\u000a      to achieve more effective burden-sharing.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers: Thielemann has been at LSE since 2000; Dewan has\u000d\u000a      been at LSE since 2003.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42111","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The project's engagement with democracy promotion practitioners and\u000d\u000a      policy makers reflects the critical theoretical principles which underpin\u000d\u000a      the research. The engagement process which led to impact included\u000d\u000a      communication of research findings through public blogs and through\u000d\u000a      preparation of plentiful dissemination materials, including a\u000d\u000a      practitioner-oriented `policy paper' which sought to communicate the\u000d\u000a      implications of the reflective conceptual approach to democracy promotion\u000d\u000a      in an easily accessible way. However, in order to ensure direct\u000d\u000a      communication of research findings and especially to ensure that a process\u000d\u000a      of `reflection' by practitioner communities could be achieved, further\u000d\u000a      steps were taken. The dissemination of research became structured\u000d\u000a      centrally around the delivery of a series of `conceptual politics\u000d\u000a      workshops' in 2012.\u000d\u000a    Two aims guided the workshops. First, they sought to communicate research\u000d\u000a      findings with regard to the contested nature of democracy and current\u000d\u000a      conceptual frameworks in democracy promotion. Second, they sought, in\u000d\u000a      relation to research findings, to facilitate focused reflection and debate\u000d\u000a      on the beneficiaries' part on the policies and practices of the individual\u000d\u000a      target organisations and thereby to enhance practitioners' awareness of,\u000d\u000a      and capacity to perceive and debate, conceptual issues in relation to\u000d\u000a      their work. The focus was on impacting beneficiaries' awareness of, and\u000d\u000a      capacity to think about, democracy promotion in new conceptually informed\u000d\u000a      ways, although some behavioural change also arose as a result of changes\u000d\u000a      in awareness and capacity to engage in conceptual reflection (see below).\u000d\u000a    Through these workshops, the research findings have had significant\u000d\u000a      global reach among the relevant practitioner community. Eleven conceptual\u000d\u000a      politics workshops were organised in 2012 at key practitioner sites such\u000d\u000a      as: the US Department of State, USAID and National Democratic Institute\u000d\u000a      (NDI) in Washington D.C.; UN Secretariat\/United Nations Democracy Fund in\u000d\u000a      New York; Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, Berlin; International IDEA, Stockholm;\u000d\u000a      Heinrich B&#246;ll Stiftung, Brussels; Danish Institute for Parties and\u000d\u000a      Democracy, Copenhagen; and DEMO Finland, Helsinki. Also, a one-day\u000d\u000a      conference at Chatham House was organised, which aimed to generate debate\u000d\u000a      on project findings amongst high level policy makers and NGO actors.\u000d\u000a      Practitioner participants at events included: EU Commission officials, US\u000d\u000a      Department of State officials, UN officials, government ministers,\u000d\u000a      development practitioners, think-tank leaders and officials, trade union\u000d\u000a      officials and representatives of party-political democracy support\u000d\u000a      organisations, political foundations, private consultancy firms, NGO\u000d\u000a      movements and other network organisations. An estimated minimum of 120\u000d\u000a      participants attended the workshops and another 60 participated in the\u000d\u000a      Chatham House conference. Access to a number of high profile practitioner\u000d\u000a      organisations resulted from initial positive contacts developed through\u000d\u000a      dissemination events. For example, access to the US Department of State\u000d\u000a      was facilitated by early positive engagement with a representative of the\u000d\u000a      organisation (5.1).\u000d\u000a    Significance of impact on these practitioner communities is indicated by\u000d\u000a      both survey returns from participants at events and testimonials. Survey\u000d\u000a      returns, completed between three to twelve months after the initial event,\u000d\u000a      strongly support our claim to have altered the way in which practitioners\u000d\u000a      think about, and indeed practice, democracy promotion. Feedback from\u000d\u000a      participants (5.2) indicates that 95% of the participants who responded\u000d\u000a      were of the view that `essential contestability' is a notion relevant to\u000d\u000a      their work. While most responding participants (90%) indicated that they\u000d\u000a      were aware of the notion of essential contestability prior to the\u000d\u000a      workshops, the feedback also indicates that following the events 75% of\u000d\u000a      participants had an increased awareness of the multiple meanings of\u000d\u000a      democracy and 60% had an increased capacity to identify the often hidden\u000d\u000a      conceptual dimensions of democracy promotion.\u000d\u000a    Feedback reviews indicate that 65% of the participants who responded\u000d\u000a      recorded changes in their thinking about their work in the aftermath of\u000d\u000a      the project events. For example, one participant indicated that when she\u000d\u000a      plans `the content of activities (of the democracy project of her\u000d\u000a      foundation) [she] think[s] more carefully about how the concepts are used'\u000d\u000a      with specific consideration given to the potential differences of meaning\u000d\u000a      attached to democracy by recipients and donors. Another participant\u000d\u000a      indicated that participation at a conceptual politics event had the impact\u000d\u000a      of `emphasizing stronger the risks of \"technicalisation\" of democracy\u000d\u000a      support, as well as underscoring the very real differences of\u000d\u000a      interpretation of key democratic values, such as participation,\u000d\u000a      representation, solidarity and equality' (5.2).\u000d\u000a    Furthermore, 35% of participants indicated that exposure to the project\u000d\u000a      findings has already had an impact on the practices of his\/her\u000d\u000a      organisation. For example, one participant, whose organisation had been\u000d\u000a      thinking about the possibility of a summer school on trade union policies\u000d\u000a      and democracy reported that `the project helped clarify the approaches\u000d\u000a      (sic) and confidence it is worth making an effort' (5.2). Another\u000d\u000a      NGO-practitioner noted that they had since the event delivered a talk\u000d\u000a      specifically addressing the role of `alternative democratic actors' in her\u000d\u000a      specialist geographical area (5.2).\u000d\u000a    Testimonials from key practitioners verify the significance of impact\u000d\u000a      generated by project findings. A UK-based international development\u000d\u000a      consultant and practitioner also attests to the impact of his engagement\u000d\u000a      with the project. This consultant practitioner not only participated in an\u000d\u000a      event organised at Chatham House, but also developed close links with the\u000d\u000a      project team, up to the point of working together with a project team\u000d\u000a      member on a co-authored paper which sought to express the project's\u000d\u000a      insights on conceptions of democracy in the context of specific case\u000d\u000a      expertise of the practitioner. He highlights that he has `been able to\u000d\u000a      apply the aspect of [his] academic engagement in practical ways' (5.3). He\u000d\u000a      recognises that many impacts amount to `subtle alterations to the way in\u000d\u000a      which [he] approach[es] these practical and professional issues with\u000d\u000a      absorbed knowledge from the project' (5.3). He claims that `there are also\u000d\u000a      some quite specific practical areas in which [his] approach has been\u000d\u000a      enhanced as a result of [his] involvement in the project' (5.3). He gives\u000d\u000a      as an example that he `was able to draw upon the project work to promote\u000d\u000a      increased emphasis on social transition rather than reliance on\u000d\u000a      institution building as a sign of progress towards democracy. [He] sought\u000d\u000a      to reassure donors and agencies involved in democracy promotion that it is\u000d\u000a      not just acceptable, but also necessary, to allow political space to\u000d\u000a      develop within the implementation of a democracy promotion programme in\u000d\u000a      which contextualised forms of democratic process at the social level can\u000d\u000a      emerge' (5.3). This has informed his practices in specific cases, in\u000d\u000a      relation to particular assignments, such as work undertaken in relation to\u000d\u000a      a long term contract (from January 2012 to February 2013) with the British\u000d\u000a      Government Stabilisation Unit (FCO-DfID-MoD) through which he provided\u000d\u000a      advice for the UN on the broader concepts of support for elections in\u000d\u000a      South Sudan.\u000d\u000a    The Director of DEMO Finland (Political Parties of Finland for Democracy)\u000d\u000a      also attests that, as she seeks to implement the Finnish government's new\u000d\u000a      Development Policy Programme, `the findings of the Political Economies\u000d\u000a        of Democratisation-project raise important questions that we should\u000d\u000a      consider when we try to concretize the new development policy's democracy\u000d\u000a      focus'. She highlights especially the findings of the project on\u000d\u000a      standardization of democracy assistance (discussed in publications 3.3 and\u000d\u000a      3.4) as highly relevant (5.4).\u000d\u000a    Also, beneficiary sources record impact. One workshop participant wrote a\u000d\u000a      lengthy blog entry on a political foundation website calling for attention\u000d\u000a      to be paid to the political nature of democracy support. In so doing, she\u000d\u000a      makes numerous direct references to the research and dissemination\u000d\u000a      materials of the Political Economies of Democratisation-project\u000d\u000a      (5.5). Another report on an event records the reflections of the Danish\u000d\u000a      Minister for Development on the project ideas (5.6), while the EU's Office\u000d\u000a      for Promotion of Parliamentary Democracy highlights the Conceptual\u000d\u000a        Politics of Democracy Promotion book as an important source in its\u000d\u000a      newsletter's section `New and noteworthy &#8212; Publications and Resources'\u000d\u000a      (5.7). The UN includes the project's `policy paper' Rethinking\u000d\u000a        Democracy Support, which directly refers to project publications, on\u000d\u000a      its Global Issues Resources site (5.8).\u000d\u000a    Furthermore, impact on practitioners is reflected in on-going invitations\u000d\u000a      to contribute to practitioner workshops, projects and conferences\u000d\u000a      (exemplified by 5.9). Importantly, the unique conceptual angle of the\u000d\u000a      research seems to have generated interest in the project amongst\u000d\u000a      practitioners, demonstrating the relevance of this kind of conceptual work\u000d\u000a      for practitioner communities. As is indicated by the correspondence\u000d\u000a      attached to one invitation received by Professor Kurki to contribute to an\u000d\u000a      event organised by a prominent democracy promotion organisation\u000d\u000a      (specifically, for the benefit of internal debate amongst its staff), it\u000d\u000a      is the project's `thinking outside the box' which motivated the\u000d\u000a      practitioners to extend the invitation (5.9).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study examines the impact of research relating to the\u000d\u000a      conceptual foundations of democracy promotion on thought and practice of\u000d\u000a      the relevant practitioner communities.

The `Political Economies of Democratisation' project sought\u000d\u000a      to analyse the implications of democracy's `contested' nature as a concept\u000d\u000a      for the concrete practices and principles of `democracy promotion', a key\u000d\u000a      foreign policy agenda for many Western states and a key objective also for\u000d\u000a      many international organisations and non-governmental actors today. The\u000d\u000a      core team consisted of Principal Investigator Professor Milja Kurki (based\u000d\u000a      at Aberystwyth throughout the assessment cycle) and Postdoctoral Fellows\u000d\u000a      Dr Christopher Hobson (based at Aberystwyth from start of the project July\u000d\u000a      2008 until February 2010) and Dr Jeff Bridoux (based at Aberystwyth since\u000d\u000a      April 2010 to present, from July 2012 as Lecturer).\u000d\u000a    In its first stage, the research argued, on a theoretical basis, that\u000d\u000a      democracy is an `essentially contested concept' and explored the\u000d\u000a      theoretical implications of this idea. During the first stage of research\u000d\u000a      various traditions of democratic thinking were examined and\u000d\u000a      `politico-economic models of democracy' were delineated. Then, in its\u000d\u000a      second stage, the research analysed, in relation to the variety of\u000d\u000a      politico-economic models specified, the current conceptual contours of\u000d\u000a      democracy promotion among four key democracy promotion actors &#8212; the US,\u000d\u000a      the EU, International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and civil society\u000d\u000a      organisations. The study specifically examined how `democracy' is\u000d\u000a      conceived by key democracy promotion actors today; how donors deal with\u000d\u000a      the essentially contested nature of the idea of democracy; what conceptual\u000d\u000a      contours of democracy promotion tell us about the present world order; and\u000d\u000a      what effect reflection on conceptual orders can have for contemporary\u000d\u000a      democracy promotion policy practice.\u000d\u000a    The study argued that conceptual foundations of democracy promotion are,\u000d\u000a      problematically, under-studied in democracy promotion analysis and poorly\u000d\u000a      reflected on in practice of democracy promotion (3.1, 3.2, 3.3). It was\u000d\u000a      argued that scholars and practitioners need to pay more attention to\u000d\u000a      conceptions of democracy they work with, because through clearer and more\u000d\u000a      systematic reflection on conceptual aspects of their work important new\u000d\u000a      dynamics can be observed in democracy promotion. To adopt a conceptual\u000d\u000a      angle to reflection on practical problems is highly unusual in this policy\u000d\u000a      agenda, but, the project argues, uniquely able to provide new insights and\u000d\u000a      provocations for the agenda.\u000d\u000a    Many specific insights were reached on the democracy promotion of the US,\u000d\u000a      EU, IFIs and civil society organisations, but the main findings across the\u000d\u000a      actors were as follows. First, the project finds that debate on\u000d\u000a      democracy's multiple meanings is not fully reflected on or explored in\u000d\u000a      democracy promotion practice. As a result, a `fuzzy' and increasingly\u000d\u000a      `implicitly' liberal democratic consensus on democracy emerges from the\u000d\u000a      discourses and practices of democracy promoters. The lack of reflection\u000d\u000a      on, and the acceptance of, `implicit liberalism' in democracy promotion\u000d\u000a      has many problematic effects. For example, there is a tendency to approach\u000d\u000a      democratisation without an awareness of the contextual and flexible nature\u000d\u000a      of democracy for recipients and with a poor understanding of conceptual\u000d\u000a      dimensions of practical problems (3.3). There is also a tendency to\u000d\u000a      technicalise delivery of democracy promotion. Mechanisms of civil society\u000d\u000a      funding, for example, do not adequately address the potentially multiple\u000d\u000a      meanings of democracy but assume a `neutral' understanding of democracy,\u000d\u000a      which however can carry a conceptual bias towards specific (often\u000d\u000a      `liberal' or `neoliberal') conceptions of democracy (3.4). As a result,\u000d\u000a      the inability of democracy promoters to `see' some democratic actors and\u000d\u000a      their different ideas of democracy goes un-noticed. The ability of\u000d\u000a      democracy promoters to fully engage with the consequences of `essential\u000d\u000a      contestability' remains constrained. These constraints are explored\u000d\u000a      through an engagement with Foucauldian and Gramscian theoretical\u000d\u000a      perspectives (3.3).\u000d\u000a    Second, despite these tendencies towards a depoliticised, implicitly\u000d\u000a      liberal view of democracy, the study also found interesting conceptual\u000d\u000a      openings. Indeed, liberal democracy is interpreted to mean slightly\u000d\u000a      different things in different practitioner communities. It has gone\u000d\u000a      un-noticed that there have been some subtle movements away from `classical\u000d\u000a      liberal' ideals towards exploration of what seem to be `reform liberal' or\u000d\u000a      even `social democratic' meanings of democracy (3.3). Many practitioners,\u000d\u000a      as well as scholars, remain unaware of these shifts. Yet, the project\u000d\u000a      argues, such unacknowledged shifts can open up new avenues for democracy\u000d\u000a      promoters to explore (3.3).\u000d\u000a    A critical theoretical perspective informed the research design of this\u000d\u000a      project, including the development of a critical theoretical approach to\u000d\u000a      engagement with practitioners (3.3). The project argued that\u000d\u000a      value-orientations or policy directions need to be generated from\u000d\u000a        within democracy-promoting communities themselves, rather than\u000d\u000a      emanating from `external' recommendations, a principle which engagement\u000d\u000a      (described below) sought to embody.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42112","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    McInnes' research has generated impact on both public policy and on\u000a      public policy discussions of officials and policy makers, nationally and\u000a      globally. This impact has been had in two areas: in policy framings of the\u000a      relationship between health and foreign and security policy, and in\u000a      understandings of HIV\/AIDS and security.\u000a    First, the research on the relationship between global health and\u000a      foreign\/security policy had a direct impact on the White Paper Health\u000a        is Global: A UK Government Strategy 2008-13. The process leading up\u000a      to this impact started with initial dissemination of findings in\u000a      co-operation with The Nuffield Trust, which organised a series of\u000a      seminars, conferences and workshops with practitioners. These were held in\u000a      the UK, US and Australia and included senior level policy makers (up to\u000a      and including Foreign Minister) and senior civil servants. From the UK,\u000a      senior officials from Department for International Development (DfID),\u000a      Department of Health (DoH) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)\u000a      attended, including the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health.\u000a      Following these initial contacts, McInnes was subsequently invited to a\u000a      series of workshops held jointly between the Department of Health and\u000a      Foreign and Commonwealth Office, under the auspices of the UK Chief\u000a      Medical Officer. McInnes' research findings on a broadened agenda with\u000a      regard to health and security provided the focus of a dedicated workshop\u000a      in this series. These provided the background to the development of a UK\u000a      Global Health Strategy.\u000a    This process of informing policy discussions culminated in policy impact\u000a      in 2008, seen in the publication of Health is Global: A UK Government\u000a        Strategy 2008-13, a cross-Departmental White Paper linking health\u000a      and foreign policy as well as development. The impact of McInnes' work for\u000a      The Nuffield Trust is reflected both in the broader perspective taken in\u000a      the White Paper on the relationship between health and foreign policy, and\u000a      by his recommendations on assessment being openly cited in the White Paper\u000a      as providing a potential template for judging the Strategy's\u000a      success (5.1). In the subsequent Impact Assessment of `Health is\u000a        Global: A UK Government Strategy 2008- 13', five of the ten\u000a      underpinning principles in the impact assessment (principles 2,3,4, 6 and\u000a      10) directly reflect questions in McInnes' template (questions 2, 4,5 and\u000a      8) (5.2).\u000a    Further impact on policy discussions of McInnes' research on the\u000a      broadened agenda of health and security is reflected in the invitation to\u000a      speak to a High Level Cabinet Office meeting in 2009. The purpose of the\u000a      meeting was to assess the National Security Strategy and discuss its\u000a      future development. Reflecting his research expertise on global health and\u000a      security, McInnes was specifically asked to speak to the meeting on the\u000a      position of health as a security issue for the UK (5.3).\u000a    The impact of McInnes' research on policy discussions in the UK has been\u000a      on-going. In 2012 McInnes was also invited to attend a meeting of the\u000a      Health Protection Agency's Global Health Technical Committee (5.4). This\u000a      was a sub-committee of the Health Protection Agency's Board, chaired by a\u000a      Non-Executive Director of the Board. It reported directly to the Board on\u000a      global health issues affecting the UK. McInnes, on the recommendation of\u000a      the Chair of Global Health Technical Committee, was approached `regarding\u000a      global health and security issues, given HPA's role in improving global\u000a      health security, as part of the UK government's Health is Global\u000a        outcomes framework (sic).' He was specifically asked to `present on\u000a      [his] work on new global security challenges' and to participate in the\u000a      subsequent discussion on developing the UK's preparedness for health\u000a      threats (5.4).\u000a    Internationally, McInnes' research on health and foreign and security\u000a      policy also led to him being invited to become a Temporary Adviser to the\u000a      World Health Organization in developing its global health diplomacy\u000a      network (5.5). Specifically, the World Health Organization, on the\u000a      recommendation of the current Global Health Security Adviser at the US\u000a      National Security Council, requested that McInnes and Rushton's `really\u000a      good paper' on health as a bridge for peace be provided as the background\u000a      brief to a meeting in July 2009 (5.6). This paper was based on the\u000a      research funded by the ESRC and had been published as 3.4.\u000a    Second, CHAIR's research on HIV\/AIDS and security has also impacted on\u000a      policy discussions. Research on this relationship led to an invitation for\u000a      McInnes to speak on the subject at a workshop in Thailand in April 2009\u000a      (5.7). The workshop, on the politics of HIV\/AIDS, was co-organised by the\u000a      Senior Adviser to the Executive Director of the Joint UN Programme on\u000a      HIV\/AIDS (UNAIDS), and was sponsored by UNAIDS. The workshop's agenda was\u000a      to inform discussions building up to the UN High Level Meeting on HIV\/AIDS\u000a      and the subsequent Special Session of the Security Council, both held in\u000a      2011, and the 2012 conference of the International Aids Society, the\u000a      largest and most significant professional\/civil society actor in the\u000a      global fight against the disease.\u000a    McInnes' research and contribution to the workshop led directly to him\u000a      being asked by the Senior Adviser to contribute to the framing of the\u000a      General Assembly and Security Council meetings by commenting on the draft\u000a      `White Paper'. McInnes' contributions were received as being of `immense\u000a      help' (5.8). The influence of McInnes' contributions to policy discussions\u000a      in the UN is seen in the address of UNAIDS' Executive Director to the\u000a      Security Council in 2011. His statement was in stark contrast to that of\u000a      his predecessor, Peter Piot's, declaration of a strong link between HIV\u000a      and security, made in the January 2000 meeting of the Security Council. In\u000a      2011 UNAIDS Executive Director, directly echoing McInnes' argument on\u000a      HIV\/AIDS and security (3.6, that 'the links between HIV\/AIDS and security\u000a      are far from straightforward and a greater appreciation of nuances is\u000a      required'), and repudiating the claims of a few years previously that\u000a      there was no link, stated that: `The risk HIV poses to peace and security\u000a      is far more nuanced than we thought in 2000'. This was reiterated in the\u000a      official UN press release accompanying the meeting, and in the report on\u000a      the UN website (5.9).\u000a    CHAIR staff remain very active in public engagement and impact\u000a      generation. For example, in 2012 McInnes and colleagues hosted a major\u000a      symposium at Chatham House presenting research findings of recent research\u000a      on global health governance to an audience of 100 practitioners and policy\u000a      makers, which in turn resulted in CHAIR staff being invited to consult for\u000a      the Norwegian-government funded Commission on Global Governance for\u000a      Health, and produce the Commission's report for presentation at the UN\u000a      General Assembly. CHAIR under the leadership of Professor McInnes is then\u000a      set to continue to serve as a site of important nationally and globally\u000a      relevant high-quality research on global health.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes the impact on public policy and public policy\u000a      discussions, nationally and internationally, of research conducted in the\u000a      Centre for Health and International Relations (CHAIR) at Aberystwyth\u000a      University.

This work is multi-disciplinary in\u000a      nature and much of it has been conducted with partners in Schools of\u000a      Public Health, especially the London School of Hygiene and Tropical\u000a      Medicine (LSHTM), and in collaboration with colleagues at CHAIR, notably\u000a      with Dr Simon Rushton, based at CHAIR in Aberystwyth from 2004 until\u000a      August 2012.\u000a    McInnes, who holds the UNESCO Chair in HIV\/AIDS, Health Education and\u000a      Security in Africa at Aberystwyth University, was one of the first\u000a      researchers in the UK to identify how the shift from `international' to\u000a      `global' health had created opportunities for new relationships with other\u000a      policy sectors and especially foreign and security policy (3.1). This case\u000a      study focuses on two linked elements of this research: the relationship\u000a      between global health and foreign and security policy; and HIV\/AIDS as a\u000a      national security issue.\u000a    First, through 2003-07 with Professor Kelley Lee of LSHTM, McInnes began\u000a      to identify potential links between global health and foreign and security\u000a      policy and to identify how they might work together (what is now referred\u000a      to as `global health diplomacy'). This was research sponsored in large\u000a      part by a grant from The Nuffield Trust (3.7). With Lee, McInnes was\u000a      instrumental in developing a new articulation of this relationship.\u000a      Specifically McInnes and Lee engaged with the initial narrow focus on\u000a      communicable diseases and bio-terrorism, and demonstrated how the\u000a      relationship may be broadened to include non-communicable diseases (such\u000a      as tobacco-related illnesses) and structural issues such as access to\u000a      medicines (3.2).\u000a    McInnes also conducted specific research on the UK and health and foreign\u000a      policy for the Nuffield Trust. This led him to develop a template of eight\u000a      questions, the answers to which provided a means of assessing success in\u000a      linking health and foreign policy (3.3). Additionally, McInnes and\u000a      Rushton, supported by a grant from the ESRC New Security Challenges\u000a      programme (3.8), examined the potential use of health as a `bridge for\u000a      peace'. They argued that health investments might be used for political\u000a      effect in conflict and post-conflict settings by using the superordinate\u000a      quality of health to engage warring parties in negotiations and\u000a      trust-building. In particular they argued that such investments might be\u000a      incorporated into peace-building strategies (3.4).\u000a    Second, McInnes with Rushton also conducted detailed research on the\u000a      relationship between high prevalence of HIV\/AIDS, especially in\u000a      sub-Saharan states, and national security (3.5). In research completed\u000a      prior to Rushton's departure from Aberystwyth in 2012, McInnes and Rushton\u000a      directly challenged the prevailing wisdom on the relationship between\u000a      HIV\/AIDS and national security. The initial hypothesis was of a strong\u000a      link between HIV\/AIDS and national security. This was based upon\u000a      assumptions made about the socio-economic impact of HIV, conflict acting\u000a      as a vector for the spread of the disease, and peacekeepers being both\u000a      vulnerable to HIV when deployed and spreading the disease in mission\u000a      country and on their return. These assumptions had underpinned the UN\u000a      Security Council discussion in January 2000 and the subsequent Resolution\u000a      1308. By the middle of the decade, however, a reaction had set in\u000a      questioning the validity of these assumptions and the status of HIV\/AIDS\u000a      as a national security issue. At the end of the decade, McInnes and\u000a      Rushton demonstrated that the relationship did exist but that 'the links\u000a      between HIV\/AIDS and security are far from straightforward and a greater\u000a      appreciation of nuances is required' (3.6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42113","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Dissatisfied with the lack of critical public debate on the shortcomings\u000d\u000a      of the existing non-proliferation\u000d\u000a      regime and the discourse surrounding it, and aware of the difficulty of\u000d\u000a      introducing\u000d\u000a      change through the more conventional `public policy route' (for reasons\u000d\u000a      identified in the research,\u000d\u000a      namely, the constraints imposed on debate by the existence of the\u000d\u000a      non-proliferation complex),\u000d\u000a      Craig and Ruzicka sought to bring their research findings directly to the\u000d\u000a      public sphere in order to\u000d\u000a      increase public understanding of and debate on the issue.\u000d\u000a    In 2010 Campbell Craig had started to explore the possibilities for\u000d\u000a      informing public debate\u000d\u000a      through the media with the publication of an op-ed piece `Just like Ike\u000d\u000a      (on deterrence)' in the New\u000d\u000a        York Times. This was followed up in 2012 by a jointly-authored essay\u000d\u000a      by Craig and Ruzicka `Who's\u000d\u000a      In, Who's Out? The Non-proliferation Complex' in the London Review of\u000d\u000a        Books (LRB). As\u000d\u000a      documented below, this essay generated substantial media coverage, which\u000d\u000a      in turn has\u000d\u000a      contributed to the research becoming influential in informing public\u000d\u000a      discussions on the issue. This\u000d\u000a      section will first set out the nature of the influence on media reporting,\u000d\u000a      followed by a discussion of\u000d\u000a      how this has translated into impact on the wider public, commentators,\u000d\u000a      policy observers and civil\u000d\u000a      society.\u000d\u000a    Shortly after the publication of the LRB piece, the claims made\u000d\u000a      in it featured prominently in an\u000d\u000a      opinion article by a Daily Mail columnist (5.1). He cites Craig\u000d\u000a      and Ruzicka's piece in the first\u000d\u000a      sentence of his column and then structures most of the ensuing argument\u000d\u000a      precisely along the lines\u000d\u000a      of the LRB piece. He uses Craig and Ruzicka's major points to\u000d\u000a      question Western rationales for a\u000d\u000a      war against Iran, and to identify the long-term dangers of the cynicism\u000d\u000a      generated by the non-proliferation\u000d\u000a      complex.\u000d\u000a    Further prominent media coverage of the core claims of Craig and Ruzicka\u000d\u000a      arose as a result of\u000d\u000a      an article in the Guardian commemorating the 50th anniversary of\u000d\u000a      the Cuban missile crisis in\u000d\u000a      October 2012. The author, having read the LRB piece `with great\u000d\u000a      interest and admiration' (5.2),\u000d\u000a      also directly referred to the work of Craig and Ruzicka, specifically\u000d\u000a      their analysis of the hypocrisy of\u000d\u000a      the current nuclear non-proliferation regime (5.3). The Guardian\u000d\u000a      article has since been cross-posted\u000d\u000a      in a large number of other outlets, ensuring extensive secondary reach of\u000d\u000a      the research\u000d\u000a      findings nationally and globally (5.3).\u000d\u000a    Media interest in the LRB piece has also been reflected in\u000d\u000a      several invitations to contribute to\u000d\u000a      television and radio programmes. The provocative nature of the research\u000d\u000a      findings communicated in\u000d\u000a      the LRB piece has generated this interest. For example, when a\u000d\u000a      major American radio programme,\u000d\u000a      particularly noted for its progressive social agenda, interviewed Craig\u000d\u000a      about non-proliferation and\u000d\u000a      the hypocrisy of US nuclear policy on an extended live radio transmission,\u000d\u000a      the invitation was issued\u000d\u000a      specifically `to discuss your [London Review of Books] article'\u000d\u000a      (5.4). Also, when Al Jazeera English\u000d\u000a      TV invited Craig and Ruzicka to comment in its discussion programme\u000d\u000a      `Inside Story' on double\u000d\u000a      standards in nuclear security, the reporter stressed that the invitation\u000d\u000a      was extended because the\u000d\u000a      `op-eds were very interesting' (5.5). The BBC also invited Craig in March\u000d\u000a      2012 to participate in a\u000d\u000a      live radio debate on the Iranian nuclear programme, stressing that 'we\u000d\u000a      feel you could make a\u000d\u000a      valuable contribution to this following your stance in your recent essay\u000d\u000a      in the [London Review of\u000d\u000a        Books] about nuclear non-proliferation politics' (5.6). In this\u000d\u000a      debate Craig contended vociferously\u000d\u000a      with Matthew Kroenig, a prominent American advocate of war against Iran.\u000d\u000a    Success in informing and shaping media coverage of the issue has\u000d\u000a      translated into\u000d\u000a      considerable impact on public understanding, discourse and debate on\u000d\u000a      nuclear non-proliferation.\u000d\u000a    Impact on public discussion was exemplified in online commentaries of\u000d\u000a      prominent media\u000d\u000a      articles covering the research. For example, on the Daily Mail's\u000d\u000a      commentary site, a number of\u000d\u000a      readers, echoing Craig and Ruzicka's arguments, commented specifically on\u000d\u000a      the hypocrisy of\u000d\u000a      singling out Iran as a nuclear rogue (5.1). Also, of the 181 public\u000d\u000a      comments generated by the\u000d\u000a      Guardian article several engage in a discussion of the consequences\u000d\u000a      of the ownership of nuclear\u000d\u000a      weapons by nuclear powers as the basis for dealing with nuclear danger,\u000d\u000a      the issue specifically\u000d\u000a      pointed to by Craig and Ruzicka. A number of commentators indicate, along\u000d\u000a      the lines of Craig and\u000d\u000a      Ruzicka's argument, that they are sceptical of the current state of\u000d\u000a      affairs (5.3).\u000d\u000a    While much of the initial debate among members of the public was\u000d\u000a      generated by the two\u000d\u000a      media articles, numerous cross-postings of these articles demonstrate\u000d\u000a      substantial secondary reach\u000d\u000a      of the research and have generated further public commentaries (5.3).\u000d\u000a      Wide-spread media\u000d\u000a      attention is arguably also partly responsible for the many references to\u000d\u000a      the research on various\u000d\u000a      blog entries and newswires (5.7). A Google search at the end of July 2013\u000d\u000a      highlighted up to\u000d\u000a      191,000 results for the search entry `Craig+Ruzicka+nuclear' (5.8). It\u000d\u000a      should also be noted that\u000d\u000a      references to the research insights produced by Craig and Ruzicka have now\u000d\u000a      appeared in posts on\u000d\u000a      the subject on websites hosted, for example, in Chinese, French and\u000d\u000a      Spanish, further\u000d\u000a      demonstrating global reach (5.9). The volume and global reach of\u000d\u000a      cross-postings and references to\u000d\u000a      the research demonstrate impact which extends beyond the UK.\u000d\u000a    Further evidence of impact on the public is provided by the fact that\u000d\u000a      Craig and Ruzicka's\u000d\u000a      research has been used as a reference point in public debate on the issue\u000d\u000a      of nuclear non-proliferation.\u000d\u000a      When a public seminar on nuclear non-proliferation was organised in\u000d\u000a      Amsterdam, the\u000d\u000a      Craig-Ruzicka article was distributed as background reading (5.10).\u000d\u000a    The research has not only informed discussions among media and the\u000d\u000a      members of the public,\u000d\u000a      but it has also been acknowledged, discussed and reflected upon among\u000d\u000a      prominent commentators\u000d\u000a      and policy observers. In a letter to a journal oriented towards policy\u000d\u000a      makers, a leading former UN\u000d\u000a      diplomat and an opinion-former in the nuclear policy field, for example,\u000d\u000a      states that: `Painful though\u000d\u000a      it is, given the contribution the NPT has, in fact, made to global\u000d\u000a      security, it is difficult not to agree\u000d\u000a      with security theorists Campbell Craig and Jan Ruzicka's criticism of what\u000d\u000a      has become the real\u000d\u000a      state of affairs with respect to the NPT: ``selective non-proliferation\u000d\u000a      and ineffectual abolition'''\u000d\u000a      (5.11). Another senior fellow at a major US-based think-tank concludes:\u000d\u000a      `As somebody who lives\u000d\u000a      among those in the nuclear proliferation \"complex\" I certainly recognize\u000d\u000a      the effects that [Craig and\u000d\u000a      Ruzicka] laid out' (5.12). Craig and Ruzicka's research then has informed\u000d\u000a      and shaped\u000d\u000a      understandings and discourse among nuclear policy commentators, even those\u000d\u000a      who work `within'\u000d\u000a      the nuclear non-proliferation complex. This opens up possibilities for\u000d\u000a      reflection on the problems of\u000d\u000a      the current nuclear non-proliferation regime `inside' as well as `outside'\u000d\u000a      the nuclear non-proliferation\u000d\u000a      complex.\u000d\u000a    Craig and Ruzicka's research has also been acknowledged, cross-posted,\u000d\u000a      referenced and\u000d\u000a      discussed amongst a number of civil society organisations active in\u000d\u000a      rethinking nuclear policy (see,\u000d\u000a      for example, 5.13). A notable example of impact on civil society is\u000d\u000a      provided by a report by\u000d\u000a      `Reaching Critical Will', one of the most influential and respected global\u000d\u000a      non-proliferation NGO\u000d\u000a      actors, which features Craig and Ruzicka's research in its discussion of\u000d\u000a      social movements and the\u000d\u000a      creation of `critical will' to achieve global nuclear policy change\u000d\u000a      (5.14). The report cites and\u000d\u000a      addresses the core arguments of Craig and Ruzicka's LRB essay at\u000d\u000a      length. Specifically of concern\u000d\u000a      to the authors of the report are the constraints which arise, as Craig and\u000d\u000a      Ruzicka argue, from the\u000d\u000a      funding patterns of the `non-proliferation complex' for NGO actors and the\u000d\u000a      nature and scope of\u000d\u000a      their activity. Craig and Ruzicka's research features as a core reference\u000d\u000a      in the report's thinking\u000d\u000a      about the future direction which social movements should take in order to\u000d\u000a      achieve critical will and\u000d\u000a      thus change states' nuclear policies (5.14).\u000d\u000a    In sum, while the impact of their research on public understanding,\u000d\u000a      discourse and debate on\u000d\u000a      nuclear proliferation is on-going, Craig and Ruzicka's research, as a\u000d\u000a      result of its public\u000d\u000a      dissemination strategy, has already achieved considerable impact upon\u000d\u000a      media coverage,\u000d\u000a      discourse and debate among members of the public as well as on policy\u000d\u000a      commentators and civil\u000d\u000a      society groups.

Specifically, it demonstrates how this\u000d\u000a      research has informed and\u000d\u000a      shaped public understanding, discourse and debate on the nature of the\u000d\u000a      nuclear non-proliferation\u000d\u000a      regime.

Wheeler (at AU until\u000d\u000a      February 2012).\u000d\u000a    Professor Craig's work has analysed the unique political dynamics created\u000d\u000a      by the nuclear\u000d\u000a      revolution, a theme recently explored in a chapter in the Oxford\u000d\u000a        Handbook of the Cold War (3.1).\u000d\u000a      He has also sought to demonstrate that attempts to solve the nuclear\u000d\u000a      dilemma logically and\u000d\u000a      inexorably point toward the necessity of world government, a case he has\u000d\u000a      developed most recently\u000d\u000a      in an edited volume on global government (3.2). The combination of these\u000d\u000a      two pursuits has led him\u000d\u000a      since 2010 to become interested in the self-defeating nature of the\u000d\u000a      current non-proliferation\u000d\u000a      regime, which seeks to solve the nuclear dilemma within the existing\u000d\u000a      interstate system and pays\u000d\u000a      little consideration to potentially more comprehensive and effective means\u000d\u000a      of contending with the\u000d\u000a      omnicidal spectre of nuclear war.\u000d\u000a    A major research contribution has arisen also from the project `The\u000d\u000a      Challenges to Trust-building\u000d\u000a      in Nuclear Worlds' headed by Professor Wheeler. This project secured\u000d\u000a      funding under the\u000d\u000a      RCUK's Global Uncertainties Programme and began in October 2009 (3.5). Dr\u000d\u000a      Ruzicka served as\u000d\u000a      a research assistant on this project between October 2009 and July 2011,\u000d\u000a      when he became a\u000d\u000a      lecturer in the Department. The key dimension for the impact generated by\u000d\u000a      this project was the\u000d\u000a      research conducted on the nature of the global non-proliferation regime.\u000d\u000a      In their 2010 International\u000d\u000a        Affairs article Ruzicka and Wheeler reconceptualised the Treaty on\u000d\u000a      the Non-proliferation of Nuclear\u000d\u000a      Weapons (NPT) as a set of trusting-relationships between the signatories\u000d\u000a      (3.3). The research\u000d\u000a      explored the damage which the persistent lack of progress on disarmament\u000d\u000a      and the hypocrisy\u000d\u000a      generated by the non-proliferation regime has had upon these trusting\u000d\u000a      relationships.\u000d\u000a    In 2010, Professor Craig and Dr Ruzicka began to pursue a joint research\u000d\u000a      and public\u000d\u000a      engagement agenda on nuclear non-proliferation as members of the\u000d\u000a      multidisciplinary Core Group\u000d\u000a      of Experts on the `Challenges to Trust-Building in Nuclear Worlds'\u000d\u000a      project. This effort has\u000d\u000a      culminated in a research article in Ethics and International Affairs\u000d\u000a      (3.4). Building on Craig's\u000d\u000a      arguments about the logic of world government and Ruzicka's examination of\u000d\u000a      hypocrisy within the\u000d\u000a      existing regime, this piece traces the rise and core patterns of operation\u000d\u000a      of the `non-proliferation\u000d\u000a      complex' &#8212; a loose conglomeration of international organizations,\u000d\u000a      government departments and\u000d\u000a      agencies, NGOs, think tanks, academic programs, and charitable\u000d\u000a      foundations, all formally\u000d\u000a      dedicated to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and, ultimately, to\u000d\u000a      their abolition.\u000d\u000a    The article makes three provocative arguments about the negative effects\u000d\u000a      of this non-proliferation\u000d\u000a      complex. First, its commitment to non-proliferation makes it difficult for\u000d\u000a      the\u000d\u000a      `international community' to oppose wars against `rogue states' that might\u000d\u000a      be seeking a bomb, as\u000d\u000a      the run-up to the Iraq War in 2002-03 demonstrated. Second, the\u000d\u000a      `non-proliferation complex'\u000d\u000a      creates cynicism not only among potential proliferators but also among\u000d\u000a      other non-nuclear states as\u000d\u000a      they witness how powerful nuclear states maintain and upgrade their own\u000d\u000a      stockpiles while\u000d\u000a      demanding that other states eschew the bomb in the name of nuclear peace.\u000d\u000a      Third, the dominance\u000d\u000a      of a narrow non-proliferation discourse crowds out alternative, more\u000d\u000a      revolutionary but also\u000d\u000a      potentially more effective and fruitful, ways of contending with nuclear\u000d\u000a      danger.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42114","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has impacted on i. public policy processes relating to the\u000a      Welsh devolution settlement, and ii. public discourse on, and\u000a      understanding of, devolution in Welsh society.\u000a    The impact of the research on public policy processes is\u000a      three-fold. First, the research influenced the recommendations of the All\u000a      Wales Convention (AWC), a public enquiry, established in 2008 to assess\u000a      public attitudes towards devolution, and in particular, the desire to\u000a      transfer primary legislative powers to the NAW. Informed by their research\u000a      on public attitudes in Wales, Scully and Wyn Jones presented summaries of\u000a      their work to the Convention in 2008. This work was, as members of the\u000a      Convention confirm, `a key contribution to the considerations of the AWC\u000a      and a determinant of its final recommendations' (5.1, 5.2). As one member\u000a      of the Convention explains, the research was `an essential and pivotal\u000a      component of evidence collected by the Convention as part of its work'; it\u000a      `weighed heavily in discussions and unquestionably helped to shape the\u000a      recommendations of the Convention' in a way which `constitutes clear and\u000a      unambiguous impact' (5.2). The AWC recommended moving to a referendum on\u000a      further legislative powers for the NAW as they, in line with Wyn Jones'\u000a      and Scully's research findings that broad support for devolution in Wales\u000a      had developed, noted `a context of substantial support for devolution as\u000a      it stands, and clear signs of an appetite for more' (5.3). It was\u000a      `following the findings of the All Wales Convention' that on February 2,\u000a      2010 the First Minister and Deputy Minister of Welsh Government announced\u000a      their intention to ask for a referendum, a motion which was debated and\u000a      agreed to by the Assembly Members on February 9, 2010 (5.4). The resultant\u000a      `yes' vote in the 2011 referendum impacted the Welsh and British\u000a      constitutional settlement.\u000a    Second, the IWP's research has impacted on other actors involved in\u000a      public policy-making processes on devolution in the UK more generally. The\u000a      research informed, for example, the more recent work of the UK\u000a      Government's Commission on Devolution, established in October 2011 to\u000a      review the present financial and constitutional arrangements in Wales. The\u000a      Commission's 2012 report on Part I of its work, prepared in November 2011,\u000a      acknowledges directly the arguments made by Wyn Jones and Scully on the\u000a      problems of conducting a referendum on a technical question (as\u000a      articulated in an article in the current affairs magazine Agenda,\u000a      drawing directly on research in their book Wales Said Yes) (5.5).\u000a      The research on public attitudes has also informed the opinions of other\u000a      key actors on future constitutional change as is evidenced by the Welsh\u000a      Government's reference to this data in its submission to Part II of\u000a      Commission's work (5.6).\u000a    Third, the IWP's work on the legitimacy of devolution has also had\u000a      secondary impact on the policy work of other organisations. This can be\u000a      seen in the Welsh Office Green Paper proposals on the reform of electoral\u000a      arrangements for Welsh Assembly elections. Some of the recommendations\u000a      made in 2012 are informed by a 2006 Electoral Commission investigation\u000a      into turnout among Welsh voters, which in turn draws on the IWP's survey\u000a      data and research findings (5.7).\u000a    In respect to the impact of IWP's research on informing and shaping\u000a        public discourse on, and understanding of, devolution in Wales,\u000a      three distinct claims for impact are made.\u000a    First, the research findings have been disseminated widely through Welsh\u000a      and English-language media (e.g. BBC radio and television, S4C, The\u000a        Guardian, Agenda, Barn). This resulted in public\u000a      commentary on the core arguments of their work. Thus, for example,\u000a      referring to their work, discussions on the motivations and structure of\u000a      the 2011 referendum, reasons for the referendum outcome, and legitimacy of\u000a      devolved institutions featured in prominent Welsh publications in 2012. A\u000a      notable example is an article `The impact of civic Wales' featured on a\u000a      prominent Welsh news magazine website `Click on Wales'. In this article\u000a      the author `reads between the lines of [the Wales Says Yes] book'\u000a      highlighting the significance of its core findings and agreeing with many\u000a      of its major conclusions. Through closely engaging with Wyn Jones' and\u000a      Scully's and arguments, the author offers his own interpretations of the\u000a      referendum process, as do the online commentators on his piece (5.8). This\u000a      indicates impact on public understanding and debate on the Welsh\u000a      referendum.\u000a    Second, the research has also contributed to improving public knowledge\u000a      and debate through having influenced the work on Welsh public opinion of a\u000a      major national polling organisation, YouGov. In 2009, Scully collaborated\u000a      closely with YouGov to develop their first Wales-specific surveys. These\u000a      were very closely informed by Wyn Jones' and Scully's previous research\u000a      expertise on Welsh public opinion (5.9). The survey findings of YouGov's\u000a      work were disseminated in co-operation with Scully at well-attended\u000a      seminars in Cardiff and at Aberystwyth in October 2009, and were widely\u000a      reported in the Welsh media (5.10). This led directly to ITV commissioning\u000a      YouGov to conduct further polls between May 2010 and May 2011 (5.9).\u000a      Through assisting in further knowledge gathering and public dissemination\u000a      in this way, the research has contributed to the furthering of knowledge\u000a      on Welsh public opinion, which in turn has assisted in informing the\u000a      public debate and discourse on democracy in Wales, as the media and blog\u000a      discussions of YouGov data attest (5.10).\u000a    Third, various IWP staff have contributed to the continuous dissemination\u000a      of the research findings of Scully and Wyn Jones through educational\u000a      activities outside the HEI. For example, Dr Anwen Elias's contribution\u000a      entitled 'Political Representation' to the Open University course, Understanding\u000a        Contemporary Wales, specifically promoted Scully's and Wyn Jones'\u000a      research findings on the subject and has impacted several staff at BBC\u000a      Cymru. BBC programme makers completed the course as part of a broader\u000a      skills and experiences programme, in part `to help them give context to\u000a      items on devolution when producing content for broadcast' (5.11). BBC\u000a      Wales External Affairs Manager confirms: `Anecdotally a number of staff\u000a      members who took part in the project have mentioned that they feel they\u000a      have a better understanding and confidence in dealing [with] contemporary\u000a      and on-going issues because of the knowledge they learnt as part of the\u000a      course'. (5.11) The role of the discussion of public opinion and\u000a      devolution is mentioned specifically as continuing to be `beneficial by\u000a      giving BBC Wales' staff a basis on which they frame current and future\u000a      debates' (5.11).\u000a    Further, between 2008 and 2013, research on Welsh public opinion was\u000a      promoted by IWP staff through development of online sources and delivery\u000a      of workshops for A-level and Welsh Baccalaureate students across Wales.\u000a    In terms of the former, Scully drew directly on his work on the 2011\u000a      Welsh Referendum in an article prepared for the A-level Government and\u000a      Politics website, www.politicscymru.com\u000a      (5.12). From December 2011 when the material was submitted to the website\u000a      to April 2013, this article had received more than a hundred hits (5.12),\u000a      which, considering the number of students taking Government and Politics\u000a      in Wales (estimated at around 260 a year across AS- and A-levels),\u000a      demonstrates considerable interest in public opinion on Welsh devolution\u000a      amongst the non-higher education student population in Wales.\u000a    School children's perceptions on Welsh devolution and public opinion have\u000a      also been informed through workshop sessions with secondary school\u000a      students. The most recent round of `schools sessions' which directly\u000a      focused on public opinion and devolution in Wales were delivered in June\u000a      and July 2013 by IWP staff Dr Elin Royles and Dr Huw Lewis. These\u000a      workshops promoted directly the work of Scully and Wyn Jones. Feedback\u000a      surveys of these events indicated a significant impact on the attendees.\u000a      87% either strongly agreed or agreed that the session had improved their\u000a      understanding of public attitudes towards devolution in Wales, and 85%\u000a      strongly agreed or agreed that the session had improved their\u000a      understanding of how people voted in the 2011 Welsh Devolution Referendum\u000a      (5.13).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The case study describes the impact of research conducted at the\u000a      Institute of Welsh Politics (IWP) on public opinion on Welsh devolution by\u000a      Professor Wyn Jones and Professor Scully.

This case study is centred on IWP research on public opinion in\u000a      Wales. The research was conducted at Aberystwyth by Prof. Richard Wyn\u000a      Jones and Prof. Roger Scully from 2001 up until February 2009, and was\u000a      continued at Aberystwyth by Scully until March 2012 (in on-going\u000a      collaboration with Wyn Jones). Dafydd Tristan contributed to this research\u000a      at Aberystwyth up until September 2002 and acted as the third author to\u000a      one of the articles (3.1). The impact of this research continues to be\u000a      promoted by IWP staff at Aberystwyth as detailed in section 4.\u000a    The research consists of i) surveys, the results of which have been made\u000a      publically available, and ii) analysis of these surveys in research\u000a      publications.\u000a    Prior to this research, the absence of regular Wales-specific opinion\u000a      surveys meant that popular attitudes on issues relating to the governance\u000a      of Wales were little understood. The research by Wyn Jones and Scully,\u000a      then, constitutes the first systematic examination of the evolution of\u000a      public opinion and electoral behaviour in Wales, during a period of major\u000a      developments in the operation and scope of Welsh democratic institutions.\u000a    Research conducted took place in two stages. First, research in 2001-2004\u000a      funded by the ESRC (3.4) examined the legitimacy of the devolution\u000a      settlement (3.1, 3.2). The marginal public endorsement of devolution in\u000a      1997 raised questions about the level of public support for the National\u000a      Assembly for Wales (NAW). Wyn Jones' and Scully's research has closely\u000a      tracked public attitudes towards devolution since the creation of the NAW\u000a      and in so doing has provided insights into the extent to which this major\u000a      constitutional innovation has become accepted as the appropriate form of\u000a      government by the people of Wales. They find that whilst negative\u000a      perceptions of the impact of the Assembly are widespread, opposition to\u000a      devolution has fallen substantially since the 1997 referendum and support\u000a      for further devolution has increased. Contrary to early predictions, there\u000a      is also no empirical evidence of a linkage between opposition to\u000a      devolution and non-participation in Welsh elections.\u000a    Subsequent research elaborated on those themes. Prof. Roger Scully was\u000a      the Principal Investigator for the ESRC-funded 2011 Welsh Referendum Study\u000a      (3.5). The survey was methodologically innovative in its use of 'rolling'\u000a      samples through the campaign period (thus allowing changes in attitudes\u000a      during the campaign to be tracked). The data formed the core of a major\u000a      study of the process leading up to, and the outcome of, the 2011\u000a      referendum on the granting of primary legislative powers to the NAW.\u000a      Scully's contribution to the book that emerged from this work (3.3) was\u000a      made at the IWP before his departure in March 2012. The book makes two key\u000a      arguments: firstly, that the referendum was unnecessary, given that the\u000a      issue was a technical rather than a constitutional one; secondly, that the\u000a      Welsh electorate voted 'yes' because of a genuine belief that the NAW\u000a      should have the right to make its own legislation. This latter finding\u000a      points to the growing legitimacy of Wales's devolved institutions.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42364","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Process from research to impact\u000d\u000a      Curtice has been a regular contributor to both print and broadcasting\u000d\u000a      media coverage of elections and voting behaviour in Britain for over\u000d\u000a      twenty years. He has also been a consultant to the BBC's election night\u000d\u000a      programmes at every general election since 1979. This has ensured that his\u000d\u000a      work on the British electoral system, and indeed his academic research in\u000d\u000a      general, is widely disseminated to the general public and comes to the\u000d\u000a      attention of politicians, civil servants, think tanks, political activists\u000d\u000a      and journalists. At the same time, his understanding of the electoral\u000d\u000a      system together with polling methodology has been called upon in the\u000d\u000a      development and management of exit polls designed to enable broadcasters\u000d\u000a      to forecast the outcome of an election as soon as the polls close.\u000d\u000a      Curtice's research has had three distinct impacts.\u000d\u000a    A. Informing public debate and understanding of the British electoral\u000d\u000a        system\u000d\u000a      In the run up to the 2010 general election, Curtice disseminated the key\u000d\u000a      finding of his research, that the election was likely to result in a hung\u000d\u000a      parliament where no one party had an overall majority, and the reasons why\u000d\u000a      this was the case, to a range of non-academic audiences. He wrote regular\u000d\u000a      articles for the The Independent, The Sunday Telegraph,\u000d\u000a      and The Scotsman newspapers (e.g. source 1), wrote opinion pieces\u000d\u000a      for The Economist and Prospect magazine, and made many\u000d\u000a      broadcasts primarily, though not exclusively, for the BBC. Curtice's\u000d\u000a      predictions and explanations of the electoral system were frequently cited\u000d\u000a      in subsequent newspaper commentary about the likely results. For instance,\u000d\u000a      Polly Toynbee in her Guardian column, 7th April 2010, (source\u000d\u000a      2) drew on Professor Curtice's research in her assessment of the\u000d\u000a      possibility of a hung parliament: \"After all these years of waiting,\u000d\u000a        the Liberal Democrats are closer to the brink of a hung parliament than\u000d\u000a        for decades. There is, says Professor John Curtice, a 50% chance, as\u000d\u000a        virtually every poll currently predicts it. There are reasons for doubt:\u000d\u000a        the marginals appear to be swinging some 2% more in favour of the\u000d\u000a        Conservatives. In quarter of those seats the Labour MP is standing down,\u000d\u000a        losing the advantage a sitting MP usually gets of some 1,500 extra\u000d\u000a        votes. But if ever there were a chance of no party winning outright, it\u000d\u000a        should be now. The public welcomes a coalition: a Guardian\/ICM poll\u000d\u000a        showed 44% want a hung parliament, with only 29% preferring Conservative\u000d\u000a        alone and only 24% Labour alone.\"\u000d\u000a    Alex Barker writing in the Financial Times, 27th April\u000d\u000a      2010, (Source 3) made similar points based on Curtice's research:\u000d\u000a    \"Experts are divided over what the rise of the Lib Dems will mean.\u000d\u000a        Some argue that calculations suggesting Labour's set advantage are\u000d\u000a        overstated because they are based on a uniform national swing. Others\u000d\u000a        such as John Curtice of Strathclyde University say the rise of the Lib\u000d\u000a        Dems &#8212; as it stands &#8212; will make no difference to the fact that Labour\u000d\u000a        wins a higher proportion of seats to votes. Gordon Brown's proposal is\u000d\u000a        to reform the system by moving to an \"alternative vote\" model where\u000d\u000a        electors rank candidates according to preference. But this could\u000d\u000a        actually accentuate the system's quirks, further exaggerating the bias\u000d\u000a        towards the biggest party.\"\u000d\u000a    Through these various means his research reached a large audience and\u000d\u000a      informed public debate in the run up to the election. In the immediate\u000d\u000a      aftermath of the election, Curtice contributed to public understanding of\u000d\u000a      the result and the implications for future elections and the future of the\u000d\u000a      single member plurality electoral system. He wrote several articles\u000d\u000a      explaining how the hung parliament came about in 2010 and why it could\u000d\u000a      happen again. The key findings of his research and their implications for\u000d\u000a      future elections were presented to MPs and others in a lecture at\u000d\u000a      Portcullis House which was aired on BBC Parliament (source 4). In that\u000d\u000a      lecture he explained why the electoral system can no longer be relied upon\u000d\u000a      to deliver a single party majority in the House of Commons. Curtice's\u000d\u000a      research was widely drawn upon by politicians and media commentators in\u000d\u000a      the run up to the 2011 referendum on whether to change the UK electoral\u000d\u000a      system to the alternative vote system (Source 5).\u000d\u000a    B. Influence on pre-election constitutional planning by the UK Civil\u000d\u000a        Service\u000d\u000a      In addition to shaping public debate before the 2010 election, Curtice's\u000d\u000a      pre-election predictions about a hung parliament were also taken seriously\u000d\u000a      by government officials. Following a request by the then Prime Minister,\u000d\u000a      the Head of the Civil Service published for the first time a detailed\u000d\u000a      statement on the constitutional conventions that should be followed for\u000d\u000a      the formation of government after the election. This statement, which has\u000d\u000a      since been incorporated into the Cabinet Office manual (source 6), took\u000d\u000a      direct account of Curtice's predictions. The then Cabinet Secretary Sir\u000d\u000a      Gus O'Donnell confirms that:\u000d\u000a    \"As Cabinet Secretary over the period 2005-2011, I was responsible for\u000d\u000a        coordinating civil service preparations for the outcome of the 2010\u000d\u000a        General Election and specifically for the eventuality of a hung\u000d\u000a        parliament and a potential coalition government. In doing so, we used a\u000d\u000a        range of scenarios and purposely steered clear of accepting any\u000d\u000a        predictions from polls. Nevertheless, we were aware that the polls meant\u000d\u000a        we needed to ensure we prepared for all outcomes including a hung\u000d\u000a        Parliament. We knew, from media reports, of the predictions of Professor\u000d\u000a        John Curtice that the election was likely to result in a hung parliament\u000d\u000a        in which no one party had an overall majority and why. As one of the\u000d\u000a        leading UK academic experts on elections, Professor Curtice's research\u000d\u000a        had a significant influence on our recognition of the need to prepare\u000d\u000a        for a hung parliament.\" (Source 7)\u000d\u000a    C. Contribution to 2010 General Election night coverage on BBC News,\u000d\u000a        ITN and Sky News\u000d\u000a      Supported by Fisher and Kuhai, Curtice directed the analysis and modelling\u000d\u000a      of raw exit poll data collected by Ipsos-MORI and GfkNOP on polling day in\u000d\u000a      2010 on behalf of all three main UK broadcasting organisations (BBC, ITN\u000d\u000a      and Sky), using the approach previously developed in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Firth. To an average election night audience of 8.202 million viewers\u000d\u000a      (Source 8), at 10pm this analysis was broadcast simultaneously by all\u000d\u000a      three broadcasters, accurately forecasting that: (i) the Conservatives\u000d\u000a      would win 307 seats (resulting in a hung parliament); and (ii) that the\u000d\u000a      Liberal Democrats would win fewer seats than in 2005. Though the first\u000d\u000a      prediction did not come as a surprise, the second contradicted most\u000d\u000a      expectations. The results of Curtice's analysis informed much of the\u000d\u000a      broadcasting coverage of the initial result of the election including\u000d\u000a      on-air statements by prominent politicians (Source 9). Subsequently\u000d\u000a      Curtice was responsible for providing for the BBC analysis of the election\u000d\u000a      results as they were declared, including above all their apparent\u000d\u000a      implications for the likely eventual overall outcome. Sue Inglish, Head of\u000d\u000a      Political Programmes at the BBC confirms that:\u000d\u000a    \"Professor Curtice was commissioned to undertake these tasks because\u000d\u000a        of his expertise in voting behaviour, electoral systems, the geography\u000d\u000a        of party support and survey methodology. The work of Professor Curtice\u000d\u000a        and his team made a significant contribution to the election night\u000d\u000a        coverage of all three broadcasting organisations in general and the\u000d\u000a        BBC's in particular. The exit poll provided us all with the invaluable\u000d\u000a        intelligence that (a) there was likely to be a hung parliament, and (b)\u000d\u000a        that the Liberal Democrats' performance was not going to meet most\u000d\u000a        people's expectations, intelligence that shaped the content and tone of\u000d\u000a        our coverage, including not least in interviews with senior politicians\u000d\u000a        during the course of the evening. Meanwhile, his subsequent commentary\u000d\u000a        enabled the BBC to explain clearly and accurately to its many audiences,\u000d\u000a        the significance and implications of the election results as the story\u000d\u000a        unfolded over the following 24 hours\" (Source 10).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Based on his acknowledged research expertise in the areas of voting\u000d\u000a      behaviour, electoral systems and survey methodology, John Curtice was\u000d\u000a      widely consulted by the media before and after the 2010 UK general\u000d\u000a      election to provide expert predictions on the likely outcome and to\u000d\u000a      explain the results.

Much of his research in the past 15 years has\u000d\u000a      focused on developing innovative approaches for predicting and explaining\u000d\u000a      the outcomes and implications of UK general elections. Two aspects of his\u000d\u000a      research are of relevance here.\u000d\u000a    First, he has advanced understanding of how the electoral system used for\u000d\u000a      UK general elections operates. The single member plurality system is often\u000d\u000a      thought to ensure that one single party will win an overall parliamentary\u000d\u000a      majority. The seats secured by the largest party are an exaggerated\u000d\u000a      reflection of its voting lead over the second largest party, while third\u000d\u000a      parties struggle to win any seats at all. However, these features are\u000d\u000a      contingent. There needs to be a significant proportion of constituencies\u000d\u000a      that are closely contested by the two largest parties, the system needs to\u000d\u000a      be even handed in its treatment of those parties, while support for third\u000d\u000a      parties should not be so geographically concentrated that they prove\u000d\u000a      capable of winning many seats.\u000d\u000a    In his research, Curtice has demonstrated that these conditions have\u000d\u000a      increasingly not been satisfied (reference 1). This finding allowed him to\u000d\u000a      anticipate (reference 2) and subsequently explain (reference 3) the hung\u000d\u000a      parliament produced by the 2010 UK general election.\u000d\u000a    Second, he has also been engaged in research on the methodology of exit\u000d\u000a      polls. To be accurate, such polls must meet two main requirements. First,\u000d\u000a      they need to be conducted in a sample of polling stations (precincts) that\u000d\u000a      between them are representative of the country as a whole. Second, they\u000d\u000a      need to translate the anticipated outcome in votes into an accurate\u000d\u000a      forecast of seats won. These two requirements are particularly challenging\u000d\u000a      in the UK because (a) the outcome of previous elections in individual\u000d\u000a      precincts is not normally published, while (b) under single member\u000d\u000a      plurality there is no arithmetic mechanism linking votes cast and seats\u000d\u000a      won nationally. Together with David Firth, a statistician at the\u000d\u000a      University of Warwick, Curtice developed a methodology to meet these\u000d\u000a      challenges. They anticipated that an exit poll was more likely to be\u000d\u000a      accurate if it estimated the change in each party's support since\u000d\u000a      the last election rather than its level of support, because change\u000d\u000a      in support varies much less from one precinct to another. However, this\u000d\u000a      requires an estimate for each sampled precinct on the outcome of the\u000d\u000a      previous election, which can only be supplied by a previous exit poll.\u000d\u000a      Thus wherever possible, an exit poll should be conducted in the same\u000d\u000a      precinct as last time. The resulting estimates of change can then be\u000d\u000a      modelled and the resulting equations applied to the results of the\u000d\u000a      previous election in each constituency in order to estimate the\u000d\u000a      probability of each party winning each seat.\u000d\u000a    Curtice and Firth developed and applied this method to exit polls on the\u000d\u000a      night of the 2005 election and subsequently analysed the reasons for its\u000d\u000a      success (reference 4). Under Curtice's direction, this method was again\u000d\u000a      implemented and evaluated in the 2010 election in collaboration with Dr\u000d\u000a      Steve Fisher and Dr Jouni Kuhai of the London School of Economics\u000d\u000a      (reference 5).\u000d\u000a    Key researchers at Strathclyde\u000d\u000a      John Curtice &#8212; appointed as Lecturer in 1988, now Professor of Politics in\u000d\u000a      the School of Government and Public Policy.

Allocated to 363 regional socio-economic development\u000d\u000a      programmes in all EU Member States, Cohesion policy is the main form of EU\u000d\u000a      support for poorer countries and regions and finances a major share of\u000d\u000a      government investment in many Central and Eastern European countries.\u000d\u000a      However, the effectiveness of the policy has been criticised, especially\u000d\u000a      by richer countries keen to reduce their EU budget contributions. The\u000d\u000a      `quality of spending' was therefore a central issue for the debate on\u000d\u000a      reforming Cohesion policy during the 2007-11 period and in the subsequent\u000d\u000a      European Council negotiations in 2011-13 on the EU's Multiannual Financial\u000d\u000a      Framework for 2014-20), as in the previous budget negotiation [reference\u000d\u000a      1].\u000d\u000a    This debate has a wide resonance. Under so-called `shared management',\u000d\u000a      the implementation of the Structural and Cohesion Funds is largely\u000d\u000a      decentralised to national and regional authorities, with decisions on the\u000d\u000a      allocation of funding to projects also involving local authorities,\u000d\u000a      development agencies, NGOs and other bodies [reference 2]. Consequently, a\u000d\u000a      large number of organisations throughout Europe have a vested interest in\u000d\u000a      EU-level decisions on how, where and under what conditions Cohesion policy\u000d\u000a      resources have to be spent [reference 3].\u000d\u000a    John Bachtler, as Director (since 1995) of the European Policies Research\u000d\u000a      Centre (EPRC) in the School of Government &amp; Public Policy, leads a\u000d\u000a      research programme on the governance and performance of EU Cohesion\u000d\u000a      policy. Established in 1996, the programme involves comparative research\u000d\u000a      on the management and implementation of Structural and Cohesion Funds\u000d\u000a      across all 28 EU Member States, at national and regional levels. It has\u000d\u000a      generated insights on how an EU policy area, subject to shared management\u000d\u000a      and with a common regulatory framework, is implemented in different\u000d\u000a      countries and regions. The methodological approach has involved bottom-up\u000d\u000a      research on the individual administrative functions (e.g. programming,\u000d\u000a      project selection, financial management, monitoring, evaluation, and\u000d\u000a      audit) and institutional arrangements used in each Member State, and the\u000d\u000a      relationship between governance and policy performance. The programme also\u000d\u000a      involves research over time, to understand the evolution of Cohesion\u000d\u000a      policy implementation over successive `programme periods' (1989-93,\u000d\u000a      1994-99, 2000-06, 2007-13).The programme involves both academic research,\u000d\u000a      with important contributions to the political science, public\u000d\u000a      administration and regional studies literatures (see Section 3 below), and\u000d\u000a      policy research.\u000d\u000a    Key findings from this ongoing research (1996-2013) have produced a\u000d\u000a      better understanding of:\u000d\u000a    a) the relative influence and interaction of European, national and\u000d\u000a      sub-national levels in the implementation of EU Cohesion policy in\u000d\u000a      different jurisdictions, and how the influence\/interaction has evolved\u000d\u000a      over time [references 2 and 3];\u000d\u000a    b) the ways in which the organisation of specific administrative\u000d\u000a      processes influence the performance (effectiveness, efficiency,\u000d\u000a      accountability) of Cohesion policy [reference 6];\u000d\u000a    c) the role of administrative capacity in determining the extent to which\u000d\u000a      Cohesion policy objectives and priorities can be achieved in practice, and\u000d\u000a      the variation in specific capacity factors (structures, human resources,\u000d\u000a      systems and tools) between countries\/regions [reference 5]; and\u000d\u000a    d) the quantitative and qualitative achievements (outputs, impacts,\u000d\u000a      perceived `added value') of Cohesion policy and the constraints on\u000d\u000a      effective performance measurement [reference 4].\u000d\u000a    The insights derived on these four issues have been seminal to the\u000d\u000a      policymaker and academic debates on the reform of EU Cohesion policy over\u000d\u000a      the 2007-13 period.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers at Strathclyde: John Bachtler was appointed as\u000d\u000a      Lecturer in 1983 and Professor in 1996, and is also Director of European\u000d\u000a      Policies Research Centre (EPRC) in School of Government and Public Policy.\u000d\u000a      Other key contributors were contract researchers in EPRC: Dr Laura\u000d\u000a      Polverari (2000-present), Dr Carlos Mendez (2003-present), Dr Martin Ferry\u000d\u000a      (2002-present), Dr Irene McMaster (2000-present) and Rona Michie\u000d\u000a      (1989-present).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42366","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Process from research to impact\u000d\u000a      In 1993 a group of ex-World Bank employees with third world experience\u000d\u000a      founded Transparency\u000d\u000a      International (TI) in Berlin to undertake a global campaign to reduce\u000d\u000a      government corruption.

We have been able to\u000d\u000a      draw upon the\u000d\u000a      academic expertise of Richard Rose for a number of our research tools.\u000d\u000a      Most significantly, the\u000d\u000a      design of Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer survey,\u000d\u000a      which this year will\u000d\u000a      cover more than 100 countries on every continent, has been influenced by\u000d\u000a      the contribution of\u000d\u000a      Professor Richard Rose, a longstanding member of our Research Advisory\u000d\u000a      Committee. His\u000d\u000a      specialist knowledge of sampling problems in developing countries has been\u000d\u000a      of value in\u000d\u000a      evaluating proposals for fieldwork and his innovative module of questions\u000d\u000a      measuring the\u000d\u000a      experience of bribery has enhanced the value of the data that we will\u000d\u000a      distribute to inter-governmental\u000d\u000a      organizations, the global media and, via our chapters in 90 countries to\u000d\u000a      relevant\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and the wider anti-corruption community\" [Source B]\u000d\u000a    Types of impact (2008 -2013)\u000d\u000a    1. Shaping and influencing the work of Transparency International.\u000d\u000a      Rose has contributed to\u000d\u000a      the design of the Global Corruption Barometer surveys since 2009. His\u000d\u000a      expertise in the area of\u000d\u000a      data collection led them to focus on bribery and corruption in public\u000d\u000a      services. His input ensured\u000d\u000a      that these surveys included questions on paying bribes for major public\u000d\u000a      services such as health,\u000d\u000a      education, police, tax collection, and offices issuing permits, and\u000d\u000a      stressed the importance of\u000d\u000a      asking whether non-payment of a bribe was due to non-contact with services\u000d\u000a      or delivery\u000d\u000a      according to the rule of law. Rose was also consulted on the content of TI\u000d\u000a      presentations at the\u000d\u000a      European Survey Research Association Conference, Ljubljana, Slovenia,\u000d\u000a      15-19 July 2013\u000d\u000a      [Source C], which brought together producers of major multi-national\u000d\u000a      continental surveys,\u000d\u000a      sponsoring organisations and TI's Research and Advocacy Team to suggest\u000d\u000a      ways in which the\u000d\u000a      design of questionnaires may be expanded in order to provide more and\u000d\u000a      better data that can be\u000d\u000a      used in the worldwide effort to reduce corruption.\u000d\u000a    2. Efficiency within Transparency International. This\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisation sub\u000d\u000a      contracts out large-scale survey work to global survey providers, who\u000d\u000a      tender for the contracts.\u000d\u000a      Rose advises TI on this aspect of `value for money' and the cost per\u000d\u000a      country. In preparation for\u000d\u000a      the 2013 GCB survey, Rose evaluated key characteristics of previous\u000d\u000a      surveys on a country by\u000d\u000a      country, and variable by variable basis and advised on the suitability of\u000d\u000a      different sampling\u000d\u000a      methods proposed, e.g. face-to-face, telephone, via internet in the\u000d\u000a      developing countries\u000d\u000a      included in the total survey budget of more than &#8364;750,000 for fieldwork.\u000d\u000a    3. Advocacy campaigns: TI uses the GCB in its advocacy campaigns\u000d\u000a      that have an impact on\u000d\u000a      national governments and major intergovernmental organizations. It\u000d\u000a      maintains a substantial\u000d\u000a      Communications and Advocacy staff in Berlin, with a website [Sources D and\u000d\u000a      G] that is\u000d\u000a      international both in content and reach. It has access to\u000d\u000a      intergovernmental institutions\u000d\u000a      concerned with reducing corruption, including OECD, the European\u000d\u000a      Commission, the World\u000d\u000a      Bank and UN agencies. To put pressure on national governments, it has 90\u000d\u000a      national chapters\u000d\u000a      that take initiatives on their own and draw on TI's central resources and,\u000d\u000a      where there is strong\u000d\u000a      resistance from the national government, as in Russia, seek to mobilize\u000d\u000a      international opinion\u000d\u000a      and institutions to put pressure on their national government. In addition\u000d\u000a      to the work of TI, Rose\u000d\u000a      disseminates the results of his own research into corruption in Russia to\u000d\u000a      policy makers and\u000d\u000a      related organisations in the UK, such as the Serious Fraud Office.\u000d\u000a    4. Publicizing and fighting corruption worldwide. From 2008 to\u000d\u000a      2013 Transparency\u000d\u000a      International has conducted three major rounds of Global Corruption\u000d\u000a      Barometer surveys that\u000d\u000a      interviewed upwards of 450,000 people in more than 110 countries on every\u000d\u000a      continent. The\u000d\u000a      Global Corruption Barometer now includes questions about whether and how\u000d\u000a      citizens would\u000d\u000a      seek to take actions to report bribes and reduce corruption. Transparency\u000d\u000a      International uses\u000d\u000a      evidence from its 2013 Global Barometer Corruption report to endorse\u000d\u000a      recommendations to give\u000d\u000a      national citizens specific tools that they can use to fight against\u000d\u000a      corruption. (P.4 of its 2013\u000d\u000a      Report, on website) In addition, in this period questions about contact\u000d\u000a      and paying bribes have\u000d\u000a      been asked in surveys of the EBRD Life in Transition survey of\u000d\u000a      post-Communist countries, the\u000d\u000a      Latin American Public Opinion Project and the Eurobarometer. The results\u000d\u000a      of these surveys are\u000d\u000a      disseminated worldwide on a multi-lingual basis through Transparency\u000d\u000a      International's\u000d\u000a      Secretariat in Berlin and 90 national chapters, through national offices\u000d\u000a      of the European Bank for\u000d\u000a      Reconstruction and Development and through the US Aid for International\u000d\u000a      Development. Since\u000d\u000a      they are in the public domain and available via the internet, the evidence\u000d\u000a      can be picked up by\u000d\u000a      national media and by elected representatives seeking to put pressure on\u000d\u000a      governments that\u000d\u000a      tolerate their officials extracting bribes from citizens. [Sources E and\u000d\u000a      F]. Leading members of TI\u000d\u000a      also highlight the need to fight against corruption [Sources H and I]. The\u000d\u000a      importance of this\u000d\u000a      corruption research is illustrated by acceptance for attendance at 23-25\u000d\u000a      September, 2013 joint\u000d\u000a      CSPP-Transparency International Workshop in Berlin on use of surveys in\u000d\u000a      combatting\u000d\u000a      corruption. Representatives of the World Bank, European Commission, OECD,\u000d\u000a      European Bank\u000d\u000a      for Research and Development, UN Development Programme, UN Office on Drugs\u000d\u000a      and Crime\u000d\u000a      and the UK Department for International Development attended.\u000d\u000a    5. Increasing awareness of the importance of contact with specific\u000d\u000a        public services. The\u000d\u000a      dissemination of surveys of the experience of bribery has moved the\u000d\u000a      discourse around\u000d\u000a      combatting corruption from the fight against `corrupt countries' to\u000d\u000a      pinpoint problems with specific\u000d\u000a      services. Health care and education, the two services that Rose's research\u000d\u000a      has identified as\u000d\u000a      among those most likely to involve bribery, are of central importance in\u000d\u000a      achieving three of the\u000d\u000a      eight Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations. \"As the Global\u000d\u000a      Corruption\u000d\u000a      Barometer 2013 shows, corruption is seen to be running through the\u000d\u000a      foundations of the\u000d\u000a      democratic and legal process in many countries, affecting public trust in\u000d\u000a      political parties, the\u000d\u000a      judiciary and the police, among other key institutions\" from `Key\u000d\u000a      findings' GCB survey 2013\u000d\u000a      [Source J].\u000d\u000a    Summary: The political and economic significance of bribery is far\u000d\u000a      greater than the sums that\u000d\u000a      actually change hands as payments. Corrupt public affiliations tend to\u000d\u000a      reduce support for a regime\u000d\u000a      and provide an incentive for street demonstrations that call for its\u000d\u000a      downfall, as has been shown in\u000d\u000a      Moscow, Istanbul and Cairo. Bribery reduces the effectiveness and\u000d\u000a      increases the cost of health,\u000d\u000a      education and other investments in human capital. The rents collected as\u000d\u000a      bribes reduce the\u000d\u000a      efficiency of enterprises and increase costs to their consumers. Bribery\u000d\u000a      also handicaps the\u000d\u000a      competitiveness of enterprises in an increasingly globalized economy,\u000d\u000a      discourages direct foreign\u000d\u000a      investment and wastes foreign aid.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Because corruption involves illegal activities of public officials, data\u000d\u000a      about the scale and objects of\u000d\u000a      bribery is not readily available. Without such evidence, policymakers are\u000d\u000a      handicapped in identifying\u000d\u000a      points for effective intervention. Rose's survey research on\u000d\u000a      post-Communist countries developed\u000d\u000a      innovative measures to monitor the payment of bribes by citizens for\u000d\u000a      public services. Transparency\u000d\u000a      International (TI) is the world's leading non-governmental organisation\u000d\u000a      campaigning against\u000d\u000a      corruption, and it has incorporated the survey methodology in its key\u000d\u000a      research tool, the Global\u000d\u000a      Corruption Barometer (GCB). From 2008 to 2013 Transparency International\u000d\u000a      has conducted three\u000d\u000a      major rounds of Global Corruption Barometer surveys that interviewed\u000d\u000a      upwards of 450,000 people\u000d\u000a      in more than 110 countries on every continent. Results have been\u000d\u000a      disseminated worldwide through\u000d\u000a      the 90 national chapters of Transparency International. Rose's expertise\u000d\u000a      in sampling has also\u000d\u000a      been used to improve value-for-money expenditure on GCB surveys in the\u000d\u000a      many developing\u000d\u000a      countries it covers.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Strathclyde\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Strathclyde (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Strathclyde","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007805}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"524901","Name":"Moscow"},{"GeoNamesId":"360630","Name":"Cairo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2918632","Name":"Göttingen"},{"GeoNamesId":"3196359","Name":"Ljubljana"},{"GeoNamesId":"2950159","Name":"Berlin"},{"GeoNamesId":"745044","Name":"Istanbul"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

This research,\u000d\u000a      which is independent of\u000d\u000a      government, produced \"bottom-up\" evaluations of the relation of citizens\u000d\u000a      with 17 new post-Communist\u000d\u000a      regimes through surveys collectively described as the New Europe, New\u000d\u000a      Russia and\u000d\u000a      New Baltic Barometers.

The\u000d\u000a      research has been financially supported by the ESRC, the Austrian Ministry\u000d\u000a      of Science, Central\u000d\u000a      Bank research funds in Austria and Sweden, the World Bank, the EU, the\u000d\u000a      National Science\u000d\u000a      Foundation and other bodies.\u000d\u000a    In January 2012 Rose commenced a four-year ESRC project on the Global\u000d\u000a      Experience of\u000d\u000a      Corruption, undertaking secondary analysis of questions he pioneered and\u000d\u000a      which are now\u000d\u000a      incorporated in multi-national surveys of the Latin American Public\u000d\u000a      Opinion Project, the\u000d\u000a      Afrobarometer, the European Bank for Reconstruction &amp; Development\u000d\u000a      (EBRD) and the\u000d\u000a      Eurobarometer, as well as Transparency International's Global Corruption\u000d\u000a      Barometer. The\u000d\u000a      evaluation of concepts, question phrasing and answers are published by the\u000d\u000a      Centre for the Study\u000d\u000a      of Public Policy at Strathclyde and distributed internationally to the\u000d\u000a      policy community and academic\u000d\u000a      researchers through the Anti-Corruption Research Network of Transparency\u000d\u000a      International.\u000d\u000a    Key findings: from this on-going research (1993 - 2013) include\u000d\u000a      the following important insights:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Having contact with a public service is a precondition of paying a\u000d\u000a        bribe. Barometer surveys\u000d\u000a        therefore ask whether people have contacted different services before\u000d\u000a        asking about bribe\u000d\u000a        payment. Contact is much more frequent for health and education than for\u000d\u000a        courts and taxation.\u000d\u000a      The payment of bribes varies between services. Even if high contact\u000d\u000a        services are less corrupt,\u000d\u000a        they may still have the same absolute level of bribery as more corrupt\u000d\u000a        low-contact services.\u000d\u000a      Opportunities for low-level public officials to seek bribes vary with\u000d\u000a        their discretion in delivering\u000d\u000a        services and with whether it is a monopoly or users have not-for-profit\u000d\u000a        or market alternatives.\u000d\u000a      Laws and directives applying equally to all services are insufficient.\u000d\u000a        The reduction of bribery\u000d\u000a        also requires measures that target specific features of particular\u000d\u000a        services. These can include\u000d\u000a        repealing requirements for permits that are the object of bribes;\u000d\u000a        computerizing marking of\u000d\u000a        student examinations; and posting publicly information about queuing for\u000d\u000a        hospital admission.\u000d\u000a      Contact with public services varies through the life cycle of an\u000d\u000a        individual, thus increasing the\u000d\u000a        likelihood of individuals at some point in time paying a bribe.\u000d\u000a      Paying bribes and public perceptions of government corruption\u000d\u000a        negatively influence trust in\u000d\u000a        political institutions and support for democratic regimes.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Key researchers at Strathclyde\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Professor Richard Rose, Director of the Centre for the Study of Public\u000d\u000a        Policy (in the School of\u000d\u000a        Government and Public Policy) from 1976 to 2006 then from 2012 to\u000d\u000a        present) was responsible for\u000d\u000a        the design of all Barometer questionnaires, publications and\u000d\u000a        dissemination.\u000d\u000a      William Mishler, Visiting Professor at Strathclyde since 1994, has\u000d\u000a        been a key collaborator in data\u000d\u000a        analysis and academic publications.

CEG has a long term\u000d\u000a      relationship with regulatory policymakers in these organisations through\u000d\u000a      which research findings have been communicated. The CEG research informed\u000d\u000a      training programmes for regulators in Exeter, Portugal, Italy and\u000d\u000a      Washington DC over the period 2009-13. Officials participated in other\u000d\u000a      workshops and seminars at Exeter including the ECPR Regulatory Governance\u000d\u000a      Conference in June 2012 which had more than 200 participants from academic\u000d\u000a      and policy-making organisations. Researchers in CEG published their\u000d\u000a      findings and the implications for policy makers in accessible diaries and\u000d\u000a      regulation tales, for example:\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/centres.exeter.ac.uk\/ceg\/research\/ALREG\/presentations.php\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/note.php?note_id=197638080284796\u000d\u000a    The research findings changed OECD's policy to embody a more\u000d\u000a      context-sensitive approach to regulation rather than assuming a one size\u000d\u000a      fits all approach. CEG research is specifically referenced in two OECD\u000d\u000a      strategic publications. The first, 2008's Building an Institutional\u000d\u000a        Framework for Regulatory Impact Assessment: Guidance for Policymakers,\u000d\u000a      cites two of Radaelli's papers and notes how `OECD countries have gone a\u000d\u000a      long way reflecting on institutional and contextual components of\u000d\u000a      regulatory decision-making'.1 Chapters 4 to 6 of the document\u000d\u000a      set out ways in which different political, legal and administrative\u000d\u000a      structures should be taken into account by officials undertaking\u000d\u000a      regulatory impact analysis. The second, 2009's Regulatory Impact\u000d\u000a        Analysis &#8212; A Tool for Policy Coherence,2 cites Radaelli's\u000d\u000a      `better regulation tales'. The `tales' about impact analysis contain\u000d\u000a      narrative depictions of a range of potential future regulatory landscapes.\u000d\u000a      The framework helps improve policy analysis by policymakers identifying\u000d\u000a      existing patterns and mechanisms at work behind them, which helps them\u000d\u000a      learn about the reasons for previous reform outcomes and helps them plan\u000d\u000a      effective future reforms.\u000d\u000a    The research similarly influenced the World Bank to take more account of\u000d\u000a      context in regulatory quality and impact assessment. Influence came\u000d\u000a      through publications used by the Bank, especially through papers in the\u000d\u000a      World Banks' flagship `better regulation for growth' programme. The\u000d\u000a      papers, titled Overview of Regulatory Quality Indicators and Project-Level\u000a        Indicators were read by staff. https:\/\/www.wbginvestmentclimate.org\/uploads\/OverviewRegulatoryQualityIndicators.pdf.\u000d\u000a      As well as influence through publication, Radaelli gave advice in a panel\u000d\u000a      to the Bank's Foreign Investment Advisory Service. He helped produce a\u000d\u000a      full-length guide to impact assessment for the World Bank Institute in\u000d\u000a      June 2008 which was used in the first WBI global core course on regulation\u000d\u000a      in Washington D.C.3 Radaelli led on the course to 40\u000d\u000a      policymakers from Africa, Asia and Europe. The Lead Private Sector\u000d\u000a      Development Specialist, IFC-World Bank, said that he learned in `subtle\u000d\u000a      yet decisive ways' (Communication to Exeter, Oct 2013) about the\u000d\u000a      limitations of conventional impact tools through CEG's events, training\u000d\u000a      programmes, informal discussions and the two Bank working papers. He cited\u000d\u000a      Radaelli as `the political scientist with the highest impact on my own\u000d\u000a      thinking and activities' and confirmed that the research changed the way\u000d\u000a      they measured and communicated regulatory performance, as reflected in\u000d\u000a      World Bank country project evaluations of regulation.4\u000d\u000a    Improving the Netherlands Government's processes for learning about\u000d\u000a        regulation from other countries:\u000d\u000a    Radaelli and team used their research on the role of social mechanisms in\u000d\u000a      learning about regulation (Radaelli 2009, Dunlop and Radaelli 2013) in a\u000d\u000a      study, commissioned by the Netherlands Government, in 2010. Research\u000d\u000a      findings about the most appropriate ways to learn from cross-national\u000d\u000a      transfer of instruments informed the recommendations. The study, How\u000d\u000a        to Learn from the International Experience: Impact Assessment in the\u000d\u000a        Netherlands &#8212; final report for the Dutch Parliament (2010) http:\/\/ikregeer.nl\/documenten\/blg-69895\u000d\u000a      developed the implications of the findings for the Netherlands. The study\u000d\u000a      was accepted by the Dutch government and discussed by the Dutch Parliament\u000d\u000a      before its principal recommendations were put into practice. The key\u000d\u000a      guidance implemented was that regulatory policymakers they should identify\u000d\u000a      and understand the mechanisms that make institutions work rather than\u000d\u000a      attempting to import policy instruments and institutions as plug and play\u000d\u000a      tools in isolation from their context. The head of the Dutch Regulatory\u000d\u000a      Reform Group, Ministry of Finance, said 'We used the report to develop a\u000d\u000a      new Impact Assessment system as part of the new regulatory reform policy\u000d\u000a      which was described in a White Paper.'5\u000d\u000a    Developing and applying new measures of regulatory performance in the\u000d\u000a        OECD:\u000d\u000a    The Centre's research findings have changed the way regulatory\u000d\u000a      performance is measured and communicated (Radaelli and De Francesco 2007;\u000d\u000a      Radaelli et al 2012). This is an especially important consideration at\u000d\u000a      times when governments try to cut both the direct and compliance costs of\u000d\u000a      regulation which can risk failing to fully consider the benefits as well\u000d\u000a      as the costs of regulation. CEG researchers worked on a project jointly\u000d\u000a      sponsored by the European Commission and the OECD on regulatory measures\u000d\u000a      to assess the quality of regulations. This research was presented to the\u000d\u000a      Commission Directorate-General Enterprise and developed into a major\u000d\u000a      research output (Radaelli and De Francesco 2007). A senior official of the\u000d\u000a      European Commission (Secretariat General) commented `The effects in terms\u000d\u000a      of how research evidence is utilised today in my team are tangible. His\u000d\u000a      research helped us to change prevalent beliefs about the production and\u000d\u000a      usage of impact assessment in the European Commission and more broadly the\u000d\u000a      EU.'6\u000d\u000a    Following the interest amongst policy-makers at the European level, the\u000d\u000a      OECD Regulatory Policy Committee approached Radaelli to produce a report\u000d\u000a      developing the implications of their research on measuring regulatory\u000d\u000a      performance for the OECD's practice. The report was the result of an\u000d\u000a      extensive exchange of communication between the OECD delegates on the\u000d\u000a      Committee and the researchers. Radaelli and the OECD secretariat worked\u000d\u000a      for two days (in Madrid, Sept 2011) to forge consensus on the principles\u000d\u000a      and contents of regulatory indicators for measuring the quality of\u000d\u000a      regulation. Delegates requested further work on specific indicators and\u000d\u000a      how they should be used. Radaelli's importance in this process was noted\u000d\u000a      by the OECD Programme Coordinator for Measuring Regulatory Performance who\u000d\u000a      said `Prof. Radaelli was involved throughout the workshop to help shape\u000d\u000a      agreement among delegates on best practices in regulatory policy\u000d\u000a      evaluation.', continuing that `The suggestions informed the development of\u000d\u000a      a framework for regulatory policy evaluation and a survey of OECD\u000d\u000a      countries on their indicator practices, paired with recommendations to\u000d\u000a      member countries on how to improve their evaluation practices.'7\u000d\u000a      The final paper underpinning the OECD document is available at http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/gov\/regulatory-policy\/2_Radaelli%20web.pdf.\u000d\u000a      The OECD secretariat then presented the, separate, formal OECD document\u000d\u000a      that came from the process, A Framework for Regulatory Policy\u000d\u000a        Evaluation, to member states in April 2012. The Framework was\u000d\u000a      circulated as recommended guidance to OECD delegates and contains several\u000d\u000a      references to Radaelli and Fritsch's work and officially endorses their\u000d\u000a      list of indicators.8\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Much contemporary government activity involves regulation of the economy\u000d\u000a      and society.

Regulatory impact assessment of proposed regulations can save\u000d\u000a      lives, limit systemic risks and promote growth. These tools are now used\u000d\u000a      by the large majority of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\u000d\u000a      Development (OECD) countries to inform their regulatory reforms and are\u000d\u000a      promoted by international organisations including the World Bank and OECD.\u000d\u000a      Using research findings to inform the regulatory reform agenda of\u000d\u000a      international organisations is a key goal of the, University recognised,\u000d\u000a      Centre for European Governance (CEG). CEG is an interdisciplinary hub for\u000d\u000a      25 academics led from political science but including staff in law and\u000d\u000a      economics. The Centre's advisory board and honorary fellows include\u000d\u000a      academics from the US and continental Europe, representatives of\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisations and an international global consultant\u000d\u000a      (Lorenzo Allio, PhD) working on regulation, providing good capacity for\u000d\u000a      achieving impact. Radaelli has led several projects on regulation rooted\u000d\u000a      in a reflexive academic approach that involves extensive interaction with\u000d\u000a      policymakers.\u000d\u000a    One of CEG's major research themes since 2005 has been to develop\u000d\u000a      perspectives sensitive to political and administrative context and to\u000d\u000a      assess their implications for regulatory impact assessment, measures of\u000d\u000a      regulatory quality and learning about regulatory reform. Radaelli and\u000d\u000a      Dunlop's research (Radaelli 2009; Dunlop and Radaeli 2013) uses models of\u000d\u000a      learning in public policy systems to analyse the ways in which\u000d\u000a      policymakers develop regulatory tools and learn from their own and others'\u000d\u000a      experiences. They have developed and applied this perspective in novel\u000d\u000a      analysis of regulatory impact assessment in different contexts, showing\u000d\u000a      that emulation and political learning often dominate over problem focused\u000d\u000a      learning. International organisations and governments tend to have a\u000d\u000a      narrow approach to the development and diffusion of regulatory reform\u000d\u000a      which is influenced by dominant models, which in the case of regulation is\u000d\u000a      often a narrow version of how economics is utilised in government. This\u000d\u000a      research was developed further adding cross-national and multi-level\u000d\u000a      dimensions with Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and European\u000d\u000a      Research Council (ERC) Advanced Investigator grants (1 of only 12 Advanced\u000d\u000a      Grants awarded across the whole of humanities and social sciences in the\u000d\u000a      UK in 2008).\u000d\u000a    The research found that the conventional approach to diffusion of reform\u000d\u000a      pursued by the OECD and other organisations created dysfunctional\u000d\u000a      learning. In a comparative analysis of regulatory impact assessment,\u000d\u000a      Radaelli (2004) disputed the notion that regulatory policy instruments can\u000d\u000a      be diffused and adopted like plug-and-play tools. Their performance\u000d\u000a      depends on how the `problem' of regulation is defined, how regulatory\u000d\u000a      impact assessment fits in with other layers of administrative law and\u000d\u000a      public management programs, and the social mechanisms determining the\u000d\u000a      legitimacy of rules and legislation. One reason behind the failure of\u000d\u000a      impact assessment programs is that policy transfer across countries is\u000d\u000a      insensitive to the political and administrative context. Radaelli also\u000d\u000a      criticized over-reliance on formal regulatory oversight institutions,\u000d\u000a      noting that what makes a regulatory oversight body strong or weak is not\u000d\u000a      its formal description in the law, but the social mechanisms by which it\u000d\u000a      operates and generates analytical capacity. In turn, these propositions\u000d\u000a      are grounded in his criticism of the received wisdom in neo-institutional\u000d\u000a      approaches to public policy design (Radaelli et al 2012). Further, he\u000d\u000a      argued that regulatory reform and measures of regulatory quality should be\u000d\u000a      more concerned with the social legitimacy of regulation and administrative\u000d\u000a      capacity rather than narrow attempts to compress compliance costs of\u000d\u000a      regulation (Radaelli and De Francesco 2007). The implications for the\u000d\u000a      design of instruments measuring regulatory performance are very different\u000d\u000a      from those of economics, and have more leverage for implementation in the\u000d\u000a      real world of public policy-making. Since 2007, the research agenda has\u000d\u000a      widened to a comparative analysis on usages of regulatory impact\u000d\u000a      assessment across Europe, the US and Canada, the critical appraisal of the\u000d\u000a      broader regulatory reform agenda, quantitative-comparative analysis of the\u000d\u000a      diffusion of regulatory impact assessment (De Francesco, Radaelli and\u000d\u000a      Troeger 2012).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42442","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2960313","Name":"Luxembourg"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"597427","Name":"Lithuania"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"458258","Name":"Latvia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Nature of the Impact: PPG has applied academic expertise and\u000a      knowledge of comparative\u000a      practices to substantially improve budget procedures and financial and\u000a      performance reporting in\u000a      large organisations, thereby enhancing transparency and accessibility to a\u000a      variety of stakeholders.\u000a    A. Improving peer learning and budget practices\u000a      OECD's peer learning efforts centre on its annual Senior Budget Official\u000a      (SBO) meetings, where\u000a      detailed country reports produced by OECD study teams are discussed.\u000a      Wehner regularly\u000a      attended SBO meetings from 2008 to 2013, and served in five budget review\u000a      teams, covering\u000a      Estonia (2008), Bulgaria (2009), Latvia (2009), Lithuania (2010) and\u000a      Luxembourg (2011). These\u000a      form an important part of peer group learning by senior budget staff of\u000a      the countries involved. In\u000a      September 2012 Wehner was invited to join the OECD Advisory Panel on\u000a      Budgeting and Public\u000a      Expenditures, composed of former SBO chairmen and selected academics and\u000a      experts. Wehner\u000a      has contributed to OECD's peer-learning advice to member governments on\u000a      public budgeting,\u000a      using its evidence base. Other international bodies including the IMF [A]\u000a      and the World Bank [B]\u000a      also cite his work on budget structures and reforms. Wehner's research has\u000a      been incorporated into\u000a      the IMF's globally-promoted series of Technical Notes and Manuals [C].\u000a    Inherently, international peer learning at top government levels is a\u000a      confidential process of mutual\u000a      exchange, and the OECD's role is advisory and not executive. Still,\u000a      Wehner's work has directly\u000a      shaped budget reform efforts in some countries. In Luxembourg, the finance\u000a      minister\u000a      acknowledged the OECD review as a stimulus for change and the main\u000a      recommendations &#8212; such\u000a      as the adoption of a medium-term framework &#8212; are being implemented [D]. In\u000a      March 2012, Wehner\u000a      gave evidence in front of a committee of the Canadian Parliament on how to\u000a      strengthen financial\u000a      scrutiny. Several of his recommendations &#8212; such as to appropriate money on\u000a      a program basis\u000a      instead of more aggregated totals so as to limit executive discretion\u000a      during the execution of the\u000a      budget &#8212; were adopted by the committee and are part of current reform\u000a      debates [E].\u000a    B. Understanding budgeting in African governments\u000a      As development aid policies have shifted away from funding specific\u000a      projects and towards `budget\u000a      support' funding and developing `good governance', accurate knowledge of\u000a      government budgeting\u000a      practices in target countries is essential. But evidence here is often\u000a      scarce or unreliable: Wehner's\u000a      work filled a key gap for DfID, World Bank and other donor agencies. The\u000a      budgeting databases are\u000a      available on OECD and CABRI (Collaborative Africa Budget Reform\u000a      Initiative) websites, and are\u000a      valued by the IMF [F] and the World Bank [G]. Gabriel Negatu, Director at\u000a      the African\u000a      Development Bank, described the 2009 research as a \"landmark in guiding\u000a      reforms in budget\u000a      institutions and practices in Africa\" [H].\u000a    C. Improving financial reporting in the European Court of Auditors\u000a      As a result of their earlier track record with the UK's National Audit\u000a      Office, from 2009-11 Dunleavy\u000a      and PPG were contracted by the European Court of Auditors (ECA or `the\u000a      Court') to review the\u000a      content and presentation of half of their `special reports' (essentially\u000a      VFM studies) and their Annual\u000a      Report. This contract was renewed in 2011 for 3 more years. The Court is\u000a      the `fifth institution' in\u000a      the European Union, responsible for monitoring the legal and financial\u000a      regularity of all the\u000a      European Commission's directorate-generals and other EU institutions.\u000a    The Court's primary output is a single, long Annual Report (AR),\u000a      which goes to the Budget\u000a      Committee of the European Parliament. The Court also produces a number of\u000a      Special Reports\u000a      (SRs) which set out the results of selected performance and compliance\u000a      audits of specific\u000a      budgetary areas or management topics, also considered by the European\u000a      Parliament. Along with\u000a      many internal changes, external evaluation feedback was brought in to\u000a      provide important key\u000a      performance indicators (KPIs). PPG's advice, along with that of the other\u000a      external evaluator Ernst\u000a      and Young, and internal factors, helped the Court to introduce significant\u000a      changes in the 2010,\u000a      2011 and 2012 Annual Reports (published a year after their coverage year)\u000a      [I] along with\u000a      improvements to Special Reports. Relevant changes included:\u000a    - a whole new chapter in the Annual Report on \"Getting the most out of\u000a      the EU budget\"\u000a      which addressed PPG recommendations on making performance more visible and\u000a      strengthening the VFM focus of ECA reporting;\u000a    - an Information Note with the 2011 Annual Report that set out more\u000a      clearly why ECA's work\u000a      and reports are important for helping citizens to assess the quality of EU\u000a      financial\u000a      management;\u000a    - notable improvements in ECA's presentations of graphs, figures, and\u000a      data; and\u000a    - a closer link between evidence in Special Reports and discussions in\u000a      the Annual Report,\u000a      one of PPG's specific suggestions [J].\u000a    Collectively these changes were major innovations for the Court.\u000a    In addition, Dunleavy delivers a feedback report each year to 120 senior\u000a      ECA staff on PPG\u000a      recommendations, covering both the Annual Report and Special Reports. In\u000a      2012 and 2013 he\u000a      met the Court's President V&#237;tor Caldeira, and also chaired a key 35th year\u000a      anniversary conference\u000a      session with leading MEPs.\u000a    In May 2013 the European Parliament's Budget Committee considered the PPG\u000a      and Ernst and\u000a      Young reports, and strongly endorsed the recommended shift to performance\u000a      budgeting. From\u000a      January 2014, both evaluators' feedback will be publicly available,\u000a      including KPI scores: this is an\u000a      important change in the rigour of ECA's public accountability and\u000a      transparency &#8212; a strong\u000a      emphasis of PPG.\u000a    Wider implications: Beyond its more immediate impact, this work\u000a      contributes to a wider debate in\u000a      the wake of the global economic crisis and the sovereign debt crisis in\u000a      Europe on more effective\u000a      accountability and oversight in public finance. A renewed emphasis on\u000a      strengthening budget\u000a      governance is reflected in recent initiatives by the OECD and the IMF to\u000a      revise budget principles\u000a      and guidance on fiscal transparency practices.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Patrick Dunleavy and Dr Joachim Wehner have led research on\u000a      improving public\u000a      budgeting and performance auditing.

Expanding knowledge and understanding of comparative government\u000a        budget practices\u000a      Research in government budgeting has been hamstrung for many years by lack\u000a      of reliable cross-national\u000a      data on budget practices. Whilst researching the topic, Wehner realized\u000a      that an early\u000a      Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) database on\u000a      budget practices\u000a      had shortcomings in terms of data quality, and re-contacted country\u000a      officials to clarify, `clean' and\u000a      revise data. Wehner additionally undertook field visits to four EU\u000a      countries as part of OECD budget\u000a      system review missions: Romania (2004), Slovenia (2004), Croatia (2005),\u000a      and Greece (2007), all\u000a      published in the OECD Journal on Budgeting (www.oecd.org\/gov\/budget\/journal).\u000a      Wehner's work\u000a      led the OECD to commission him to undertake a survey extension to cover 11\u000a      Latin American\u000a      countries in 2005-6, and to redraft the complete survey instrument for an\u000a      OECD-wide survey in\u000a      2006-7. In 2007-8, the World Bank funded Wehner and Dr Paolo de Renzio\u000a      (previously at LSE,\u000a      now at the International Budget Partnership) to collect compatible data\u000a      covering Asian, BRIC\u000a      (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and developing countries, and the UK\u000a      Department for\u000a      International Development funded an extension of the Survey of Budget\u000a      Practices and Procedures\u000a      for African countries. This work increased data coverage from around 30 to\u000a      almost 100 countries,\u000a      and improved the reliability of the information.\u000a    The data were incorporated in Wehner's initial research on legislative\u000a      budgeting [1,2] and a\u000a      subsequent book [3]. This research investigates the institutional\u000a      requirements for legislative control\u000a      of the budget process and can be used by legislators to identify possible\u000a      institutional reforms if\u000a      they wish to strengthen parliamentary oversight. The data were also\u000a      relevant for journal articles in\u000a      which Wehner established the influence of executive [4] and legislative\u000a      [5] structures for public\u000a      budgeting performance. This research highlights the importance of `common\u000a      pool resource' (CPR)\u000a      problems in the emergence of fiscal stress. These problems arise when\u000a      budgetary decision-makers\u000a\u0009  fail to consider the full cost of their actions, leading to\u000a      excessive expenditure and deficits.\u000a      The research shows that such problems can be mitigated through\u000a      institutional constraints. Overall,\u000a      Wehner's work establishes a comparative resource that can help governments\u000a      and legislatures to\u000a      identify reform options, and it shows how certain reforms are likely to\u000a      affect budget policy. This has\u000a      enabled Wehner to support efforts to improve budget procedures in OECD\u000a      countries.\u000a    B. Studying performance audit by supreme audit institutions\u000a      Professor Dunleavy and PPG staff developed expertise in performance audit\u000a      practice when\u000a      working closely with the UK National Audit Office (NAO) from 1998 to 2009\u000a      in reviewing around\u000a      440 published `Value for Money' (VFM) study reports and drawing lessons\u000a      for future work\u000a      [references 6 and 7 provide an outline of this confidential work]. In the\u000a      same period, Dunleavy and\u000a      PPG staff, working with Professor Helen Margetts (UCL, and since 2004,\u000a      Oxford), completed\u000a      seven major VFM reports, covering issues such as Citizen redress [8]. In\u000a      mid-2009 PPG ceased to\u000a      be a `strategic partner' of NAO and subsequently Dunleavy was able to draw\u000a      upon 13 years of\u000a      extensive research and close working with NAO in his co-authored book Growing\u000a        the Productivity\u000a        of Government Services, which demonstrated a huge range of\u000a      productivity experiences across\u000a      major Whitehall agencies [9].\u000a    Key researchers: Professor Dunleavy has been at LSE since 1997; Dr\u000a      Wehner has been at LSE\u000a      since 2004.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42449","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Nature of the Impact: The `digital era governance' model, with its\u000d\u000a      focus on organizational reintegration, holistic services and\u000d\u000a      digitalization, has stimulated policy debate and impacted UK government\u000d\u000a      policy. Working with and for the UK government, PPG research has played an\u000d\u000a      important role in shaping the evolution of UK e-government policy.\u000d\u000a    Evidence of Impact: In 2002 the House of Common's Public Accounts\u000d\u000a      Committee (PAC) considered progress since PPG's first report in 1999 and\u000d\u000a      its second in 2002, and confirmed all of these reports' recommendations\u000d\u000a      [A]. The formal government response to this, via a Treasury Minute,\u000d\u000a      committed government bodies to monitoring their web traffic, encouraging\u000d\u000a      the take-up by citizens of online services and ensuring the good design of\u000d\u000a      websites [B]. These were seemingly small changes but the two reports\u000d\u000a      contributed to a shift in thinking about online public services. As\u000d\u000a      personal testimony from a Cabinet Office official sets out: \"In some ways,\u000d\u000a      therefore, the real value and influence of Government on the Web\u000d\u000a      (1999) was less in its specific findings (which inevitably became dated\u000d\u000a      relatively quickly, if not as quickly as we all would have liked) and more\u000d\u000a      in pointing to a different way of framing questions and designing an\u000d\u000a      evidence-based approach to answering them\" [C]. In 2003 the UK Political\u000d\u000a      Studies Association awarded Dunleavy and Margetts a `Making a Difference'\u000d\u000a      award for the 1999 and 2002 reports.\u000d\u000a    The 2007 Government on the Internet report [D] was considered in\u000d\u000a      detail by the PAC. Dunleavy attended the PAC hearing, briefed the NAO's\u000d\u000a      Comptroller and Auditor General in the session, and the report's findings\u000d\u000a      fed directly into the Committee's conclusions and recommendations [E],\u000d\u000a      which the government overwhelmingly accepted [F]. These committed the\u000d\u000a      government to monitor both the costs of websites (often previously masked\u000d\u000a      within integrated service contracts) and the usage of their sites.\u000d\u000a      Dunleavy was consulted by Cabinet Office\/COI staff implementing the\u000d\u000a      recommendations in April 2009 on the detailed design of the new annual web\u000d\u000a      use and costs survey. This resulted in the implementation of a new\u000d\u000a      database on Whitehall Web costs by the Central Office of Information [G].\u000d\u000a      In addition, government departments were encouraged to develop channel\u000d\u000a      strategies whereby those who were able to switch to online interactions\u000d\u000a      were helped to do so, ensuring parallel offline services for those who\u000d\u000a      were digitally excluded. NAO and HM Treasury have agreed savings arising\u000d\u000a      from the 2007 report of &#163;4,800,000 in 2011 [H].\u000d\u000a    In May 2009 Dunleavy and PPG published another VFM study for NAO, Department\u000a        for Work and Pensions: Communicating with Customers [I]. The central\u000d\u000a      finding was that DWP was conducting only 0.5% of its transactions online\u000d\u000a      and was lagging well behind other government departments. The accuracy and\u000d\u000a      accessibility of online information within DWP also continued to have\u000d\u000a      serious problems. In 2012 NAO and the Treasury agreed a first tranche of\u000d\u000a      &#163;715,000 savings identified in the report [H].\u000d\u000a    The report also stimulated debate in the wider policy community, and\u000d\u000a      Dunleavy and PPG participated in a number of high profile\u000d\u000a      academic-policymaker seminars. For example Dunleavy presented key policy\u000d\u000a      lessons at a well-attended LSE\/Institute for Government seminar to launch\u000d\u000a      PPG's `Innovating out of the Recession' seminar series in June 2009,\u000d\u000a      chaired by Lord Michael Bechard [J]. Dunleavy also drew on this work when\u000d\u000a      looking at DWP's productivity in comparison with other government\u000d\u000a      organisations for an event at HM Treasury in 2012. The 2009 NAO report was\u000d\u000a      therefore an early factor helping to catalyse for a fundamental\u000d\u000a      reappraisal of delivery methods. In this context of heightened scrutiny of\u000d\u000a      DWP, the new Secretary of State, Ian Duncan Smith, launched a large-scale\u000d\u000a      reform of DWP to introduce a Universal Credit benefit, together with a\u000d\u000a      major savings\/austerity programme. In response also to a general\u000d\u000a      government IT initiative, DWP policy changed radically in mid-2011 to\u000d\u000a      commit to a `digital by default' strategy with a target of getting 80% of\u000d\u000a      its customer transactions online by 2015 [K]. A new &#163;1 billion set of IT\u000d\u000a      contracts for universal credit to be delivered online began in 2012.\u000d\u000a    Wider Implications: Government understanding of how it provides\u000d\u000a      services online and how it assesses its own performance in this sphere has\u000d\u000a      dramatically changed since the first NAO report in 1999 and is reflected\u000d\u000a      in citizens' corresponding take-up of these services. This outcome has\u000d\u000a      brought greater efficiency, ease-of-access and transparency to government\u000d\u000a      services and produced significant costs savings that are imperative in an\u000d\u000a      era of dwindling government budgets.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Patrick Dunleavy, as Director of the LSE Public Policy Group\u000d\u000a      (PPG), has led a research programme on digital era governance.

They have moved beyond\u000d\u000a      merely digital versions of paper-based transactions and embraced social\u000d\u000a      media, cloud computing and `essentially digital' public service design in\u000d\u000a      order to offer modern online information and transaction services online\u000d\u000a      that are both effective for citizens and efficient for government.\u000d\u000a    PPG, led by Dunleavy and including Dr Simon Bastow and Jane Tinkler, and\u000d\u000a      often collaborating with Professor Helen Margetts (UCL, and since 2004 at\u000d\u000a      Oxford), has conducted research on all aspects of digital governance. In a\u000d\u000a      fast-changing field this research combines fundamental rethinking of\u000d\u000a      technological changes in public management with applied work conducted for\u000d\u000a      and with government bodies.\u000d\u000a    From 2002-4 Dunleavy and Margetts co-directed an ESRC project (with\u000d\u000a      Bastow and Tinkler as researchers) on e-government changes in seven\u000d\u000a      industrialised countries &#8212; UK, USA, Canada, Australia [4], Japan, the\u000d\u000a      Netherlands and New Zealand. The working papers from this project,\u000d\u000a      together with much of the applied work for the National Audit Office\u000d\u000a      detailed below, became Digital Era Governance [1].\u000d\u000a    The major contribution of this research was its introduction of the new\u000d\u000a      `quasi-paradigm' of `digital era governance' (DEG), an approach that stood\u000d\u000a      in direct contrast to the reigning orthodoxy called `new public\u000d\u000a      management', which focused on disaggregation, competition and\u000d\u000a      incentivisation [2,3]. New public management had advocated breaking up\u000d\u000a      large government `behemoths' into smaller agencies specialising on\u000d\u000a      particular policy or delivery issues. The idea was to foster efficiency\u000d\u000a      through private sector-style competition and managerialism, and by setting\u000d\u000a      benchmarking targets, encouraging inter-agency competition, and holding\u000d\u000a      chief executives accountable for performance. At first this specialism\u000d\u000a      drove quality improvements, but eventually it led to fragmentation and\u000d\u000a      inefficiency as duplication of systems (e.g. HR) occurred across agencies.\u000d\u000a      A focus on `core competencies' also rapidly increased the outsourcing of\u000d\u000a      IT provision to the private sector. Agencies were locked into long-term IT\u000d\u000a      contracts that failed to accommodate technology developments. This elayed\u000d\u000a      progress on the digital upgrading of government services and confused\u000d\u000a      citizens, who faced a patchwork of government websites. Digital era\u000d\u000a      governance emphasised holistic services, reintegration and digitalisation\u000d\u000a      as remedies to these unwelcome outcomes. DEG recognised that citizens\u000d\u000a      should not be expected to know the remit of individual agencies when\u000d\u000a      engaging in transactions with the national government. Digital\u000d\u000a      technologies allow the creation of joined up service provision &#8212; `one-stop\u000d\u000a      shops' &#8212; where all their government needs and queries could be addressed,\u000d\u000a      and a focus on the end user should negate the requirement to submit the\u000d\u000a      same information multiple times to different agencies. DEG therefore\u000d\u000a      recommended making holistic services available to citizens through\u000d\u000a      reintegration of the multiplicity of government services.\u000d\u000a    In tandem, and feeding into this fundamental research, PPG completed four\u000d\u000a      major `value for money' studies on IT issues for the UK National Audit\u000d\u000a      Office (NAO). Each study cost approximately &#163;220,000, involved dozens of\u000d\u000a      interviews with senior civil servants, documentary analysis, site visits,\u000d\u000a      as well as the organisation of web censuses, surveys, citizen and\u000d\u000a      practitioner focus groups and later experiments to chart the development\u000d\u000a      of e-government. The project produced four key reports:\u000d\u000a    i. Government on the Web (1999), which was the first ever study\u000d\u000a      of internet use in UK government, and found that the government's 2008\u000d\u000a      target for online public service delivery was not effective because it was\u000d\u000a      too far in the future to motivate change;\u000d\u000a    ii. Government on the Web II (2002), which showed that bringing\u000d\u000a      the target forward to 2005 stimulated more change but some key departments\u000d\u000a      were unlikely to reach their targets because they were locked into\u000d\u000a      inflexible long-term contracts with private contractors that stymied\u000d\u000a      change;\u000d\u000a    iii. Government on the Internet (2007), which monitored\u000d\u000a      electronic service provision achieved in 2005 and found that UK public and\u000d\u000a      business use of online services was poor in comparison to other EU\u000d\u000a      countries according to EU-wide surveys; and\u000d\u000a    iv. Department of Work and Pensions: Communicating with Customers\u000d\u000a      (2009), which found that whilst DWP had improved its forms and\u000d\u000a      communications with customers, its investment in call centres and its\u000d\u000a      assumption that its customer base (retirees and job-seekers) were not\u000d\u000a      online contributed to a remarkably low level of online transactions.\u000d\u000a    From 2007 on Dunleavy and Margetts also defined a `second wave' of DEG\u000d\u000a      changes, showing how government transformations around social media, Web\u000d\u000a      2.0, cloud computing and digital changes were confirming and deepening DEG\u000d\u000a      development, even in austerity conditions [5]. In a PPG project funded by\u000d\u000a      a large corporate donor (EDS, later Hewlett-Packard [HP]: award of &#163;1m to\u000d\u000a      LSE), Dunleavy and Dr Leandro Carrera (now at KCL) conducted a four-year\u000d\u000a      analysis of productivity changes in six central departments and agencies,\u000d\u000a      and an analysis of performance in NHS hospitals in England, summed up in Growing\u000d\u000a        the Productivity of Government Services [6]. This `second wave'\u000d\u000a      research found that digital change and new management practices can\u000d\u000a      combine to combat Baumol effects that can raise the price of public\u000d\u000a      services in the absence of concomitant increases in productivity. These\u000d\u000a      ideas strongly informed the 2007 NAO report on later internet\/web changes\u000d\u000a      and the 2009 NAO report on DWP's customer transactions (see Section 4).\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers: Professor Dunleavy has been at LSE since 1979.\u000d\u000a      Jane Tinkler has been at LSE since 2005.

It has\u000d\u000a      fed into think tank reports and\u000d\u000a      policy discussions, and helped set the agenda for policymakers. The main\u000d\u000a      impact was on individuals\u000d\u000a      and groups associated with the Labour Government of 1997-2010. These\u000d\u000a      reports express in\u000d\u000a      normative terms, both the implications of his evaluation of the main\u000d\u000a      political parties' views of public\u000d\u000a      service reform set out above and try to answer questions set out in the\u000d\u000a      work on the relation between\u000d\u000a      markets and the state in contemporary social democracy. This normative\u000d\u000a      work on public policy was\u000d\u000a      part of an important debate in policy circles around the role of choice in\u000d\u000a      public service reform, the\u000d\u000a      autonomy of professional groups, the co-production of services between\u000d\u000a      citizens and the state, and\u000d\u000a      the use of behavioural change (or `nudge') theory to improve outcomes for\u000d\u000a      citizens in their use of\u000d\u000a      public services.\u000d\u000a    Griffiths has given many invited presentations in this area to various\u000d\u000a      non-academic and policy\u000d\u000a      audiences, which have included the Cabinet Office and major think tanks,\u000d\u000a      and has written about the\u000d\u000a      policy-implications of his research in a wide variety of non-academic\u000d\u000a      publications. Three reports in\u000d\u000a      particular grew directly out of his research and had policy impacts:\u000d\u000a    1. The 2009 report Assertive Citizens: New Relations in the Public\u000d\u000a        Services,[1] published by The\u000d\u000a      Social Market Foundation, and co-authored by Griffiths with Beth Foley and\u000d\u000a      Jessica Prendergast,\u000d\u000a      was influential. It examined the rise of the 'assertive citizen' and\u000d\u000a      argued that this change creates\u000d\u000a      profound challenges for public services, particularly for the\u000d\u000a      relationships between users and\u000d\u000a      providers. The report looked at how the public services, and those who\u000d\u000a      work in them, can adapt\u000d\u000a      to fit these changing expectations. The report's recommendations focused\u000d\u000a      on the appropriate\u000d\u000a      direction of choice-based reforms; the future role of professionals; and\u000d\u000a      the concept of co-production,\u000d\u000a      which seeks to promote greater cooperation between citizens and\u000d\u000a      professionals in\u000d\u000a      the production of public services. It argued that strengthening the\u000d\u000a      personal relationships between\u000d\u000a      professionals and service users is vital to meeting the challenges posed\u000d\u000a      by assertive citizenship.\u000d\u000a    The report was launched at a Price Waterhouse Cooper-sponsored event\u000d\u000a      attended by David\u000d\u000a      Willetts (now Minister of State for Universities and Science) and Julian\u000d\u000a      Le Grand (Tony Blair's\u000d\u000a      special advisor on health policy). It generated significant media\u000d\u000a      attention for its claim that we are\u000d\u000a      now more `assertive' in our dealings with public bodies. In particular, it\u000d\u000a      led to op ed pieces in The\u000d\u000a        Times and an extended interview with Griffiths in Community Care\u000d\u000a      magazine. It has been widely\u000d\u000a      cited since in think tank publications &#8212; for example, in work by the Royal\u000d\u000a      Society for the Arts 2020\u000d\u000a      Public Services Trust, the Institute of Public Policy Research, Involve,\u000d\u000a      and the Health Foundation.\u000d\u000a      It was also cited in PriceWaterhouse Cooper's recommendations for reform\u000d\u000a      of Australian\u000d\u000a      government administration in 2009. All these pieces are available\u000d\u000a      electronically.[1a]\u000d\u000a    Several of the ideas expressed in the report (professional autonomy,\u000d\u000a      nuanced choice in public\u000d\u000a      service provision; and coproduction between citizen and producer)\u000d\u000a      influenced policy thinking at\u000d\u000a      that period. The report was discussed at steering group meetings during\u000d\u000a      its preparation by,\u000d\u000a      amongst others, John Dunford (Association of School and college Leaders);\u000d\u000a      Karen Reay (Unite-Amicus);\u000d\u000a      Baroness Pauline Perry (Conservatives' Public Service improvement Group);\u000d\u000a      David\u000d\u000a      Walker (formerly of Public Magazine); Martin Ward (of the Association of\u000d\u000a      School and college\u000d\u000a      Leaders) and Tony Wright (former Labour MP), as well as being circulated\u000d\u000a      to ministers in\u000d\u000a      government. The report also led to an invitation to talk at several policy\u000d\u000a      organisations, including\u000d\u000a      trade unions, think tanks and a keynote address at the Independent Living\u000d\u000a      Organisation.[1b]\u000d\u000a    2. A 2010 report Collective co-production: working together to\u000d\u000a        improve public services[2] was co-authored\u000d\u000a      by Griffiths and Foley, and commissioned by Research Councils UK and the\u000d\u000a      Local\u000d\u000a      Authority Research Council Initiative (which was established in 1997 to\u000d\u000a      bring Local Authorities\u000d\u000a      and the Research Councils closer together, under the tagline `Excellence\u000d\u000a      with Impact'). This\u000d\u000a      report grew out of the success of Assertive Citizens, which argued\u000d\u000a      that individual citizens and the\u000d\u000a      state must work better to share responsibility for health, educational and\u000d\u000a      other outcomes.\u000d\u000a    Collective co-production was thus written to advise local councils\u000d\u000a      on this new area of policy. It\u000d\u000a      examined ways in which citizens could work collectively with the state to\u000d\u000a      ensure better outcomes,\u000d\u000a      and sought to share best practices adopted by local councils for various\u000d\u000a      forms of collective co-production,\u000d\u000a      including time banks, participatory budgeting, and peer support groups. It\u000d\u000a      also helped\u000d\u000a      councils to understand this policy term: thus the report was cited as\u000d\u000a      evidence by the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government's `Commission on the Future Delivery of Public Services.'[2a]\u000d\u000a    3. Finally Engaging Behaviour (2010),[3]\u000d\u000a      co-authored by Griffiths and Foley and published by the\u000d\u000a      Department for Communities and Local Government [DCLG] and The Social\u000d\u000a      Market Foundation,\u000d\u000a      dealt with behavioural change and civic engagement. It was commissioned by\u000d\u000a      DCLG on the basis\u000d\u000a      of Griffiths' earlier research to advise Ministers on new techniques in\u000d\u000a      public policy, and was written\u000d\u000a      in close collaboration with civil servants in the department. It examined\u000d\u000a      the way in which the\u000d\u000a      insights of behavioural change theory could promote citizen involvement in\u000d\u000a      public services and\u000d\u000a      elsewhere. It led to Griffiths giving evidence on behavioural change to\u000d\u000a      the House of Lords Science\u000d\u000a      &amp; Technology Committee in May 2010.\u000d\u000a    Many of these ideas have been brought together in an edited collection on\u000d\u000a      public services,[1] which\u000d\u000a      has generated significant debate\u000d\u000a      and attracted funding from the ESRC, who supported four events\u000d\u000a      at the Royal Society of Arts, held in conjunction with the 2020 Public\u000d\u000a      Services Hub and the\u000d\u000a      Collaborate Institute, to discuss questions raised by the book. The\u000d\u000a      debates were attended by\u000d\u000a      ministers and senior policy makers.\u000d\u000a    In summary, this work, and the associated media articles and\u000d\u000a      presentations, have contributed to the\u000d\u000a      debate on how to create more `citizen-focused' public services and have\u000d\u000a      had an impact on\u000d\u000a      government's thinking about public service provision. They have fed into\u000d\u000a      discussions with senior\u000d\u000a      policymakers; have provided a framework for some of policies pursued by\u000d\u000a      government in this area\u000d\u000a      in recent years; and have stimulated and informed on-going debates and\u000d\u000a      discussions about the\u000d\u000a      reform of public services in the twenty-first century.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    One strand of Griffiths' academic work has looked at public service\u000d\u000a      reform.

His work on\u000d\u000a      Labour's public service\u000d\u000a      reform agenda was articulated in a 2009 article[2] in\u000d\u000a      the influential journal Policy Studies, describing\u000d\u000a      and explaining changes in the public services under the Blair and Brown\u000d\u000a      governments. It examined\u000d\u000a      the attempt to combine significant marketisation of public services with\u000d\u000a      increases in public spending\u000d\u000a      and mechanisms to ensure fairness of provision for all citizens.\u000d\u000a    Several chapters and articles Griffiths published between 2009 and 2011\u000d\u000a      concentrated on the\u000d\u000a      policies of the Conservative-led coalition:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000a`Cameron's Conservatives and Public Service Reform' (2009),[5]\u000d\u000a        written before the party was\u000d\u000a        elected in 2010, provided an overview of the direction that a\u000d\u000a        Cameron-led government was likely\u000d\u000a        to take on public services once in office through an analysis of their\u000d\u000a        policy proposals.\u000d\u000a      `The retreat of the state: Conservative `modernisation' and\u000d\u000a          the public services' (2011)[3] examined\u000d\u000a        the Coalition's public service reform programme and its scepticism about\u000d\u000a        traditional or state-led\u000d\u000a        methods of provision.\u000d\u000a      \u000a`The Con\/Lib Agenda for Education: Learning the Hard Way?'\u000d\u000a        (2011)[4] examined Coalition policy\u000d\u000a        on education, including the introduction of market-mechanisms to\u000d\u000a        incentivise schools to improve\u000d\u000a        (such as the pupil premium) and the creation of a marketised system in\u000d\u000a        Higher Education.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Taken together, these contributions sought to explain the choices made by\u000d\u000a      the Coalition in reforming\u000d\u000a      public services, and examined some of the tensions that the government has\u000d\u000a      faced in dealing with\u000d\u000a      competing priorities. In particular, Griffiths' work looked at the use of\u000d\u000a      market mechanisms to provide\u000d\u000a      public services and increase citizen choice, setting these changes against\u000d\u000a      the changing economic\u000d\u000a      context; he also examined the ideological assumptions inherent in recent\u000d\u000a      accounts of public service\u000d\u000a      reform and provision. This has been complemented by his wider analysis of\u000d\u000a      changes within\u000d\u000a      contemporary Conservatism and the nature of the Coalition government, as\u000d\u000a      described in a\u000d\u000a      forthcoming article [\"What was `progressive' In Progressive\u000d\u000a        Conservatism\"?' forthcoming in Political\u000d\u000a        Studies Review (12(1), Jan 2014].\u000d\u000a    Griffiths has published a number of other articles on the relationship\u000d\u000a      between market and state in\u000d\u000a      modern social democracy.[6,7,8,9] Collectively this body\u000d\u000a      of publications describes extensive\u000d\u000a      underpinning research which constitutes a solid foundation for the\u000d\u000a      normative work described in the\u000d\u000a      following section that Griffiths has carried out on public service reform\u000d\u000a      with various bodies, and which\u000d\u000a      has had an impact on their thinking in this area.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42659","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6254930","Name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"2233387","Name":"Cameroon"},{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"203312","Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2434508","Name":"Chad"},{"GeoNamesId":"878675","Name":"Zimbabwe"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The uniqueness and significance of the Artraker Prize have to do\u000a      with the opportunities that it creates\u000a      for change to occur, even in conflict-ridden communities and locations.\u000a      The first Artraker Prize,\u000a      presented on International Peace Day, 21 September 2013, but awarded\u000a      during the Impact\u000a      assessment period, was won by Alexia Webster, a South African photographer\u000a      who will use her prize\u000a      fund to set up temporary Street Studios in Tanzania and Chad, where\u000a      hundreds of thousands of\u000a      Sudanese refugees from Darfur are living in camps. Webster, who previously\u000a      worked with the\u000a      Blikkiesdorp and Chiawelo peoples (two South African communities affected\u000a      by structural violence),\u000a      was awarded the prize money for her ability to create images that are\u000a      deeply significant for the\u000a      individuals caught up in violence, rather than for western consumers of\u000a      `conflict photography' or `art'.\u000a      Such photographs are made, not for the western art market, but for those\u000a      who are separated from\u000a      family members, have few possessions and little money to print images of\u000a      themselves. By creating\u000a      and freely distributing family photographs, Webster helps people reassure\u000a      distant friends and family\u000a      as to their safety and survival, and in so doing, they are able also to\u000a      affirm their identities and resist\u000a      their own categorisation as `displaced persons' or `refugees'. This work\u000a      (which Buckley calls \"neither\u000a      art nor politics\") seeks to affirm identity and self-worth, rather than to\u000a      be valued as aesthetically\u000a      interesting or as documentary evidence: it has huge significance for\u000a      ordinary people, who through\u000a      no fault of their own, have been thrust into highly traumatic\u000a      circumstances. For this reason, Buckley's\u000a      influence on Artraker had the effect of turning it from being a prize into\u000a      an `anti-prize', a turn which is\u000a      explicitly acknowledged on the website. It rewards not the achievement of\u000a      the artist, but the potential\u000a      for change that the artist creates.\u000a    Buckley's research on the potential of art as a change-maker was the key\u000a      influence on Manali Jagtap,\u000a      founder of Inca Consulting (16) and Buckley's former MA Art and Politics\u000a      student, in her decision to\u000a      set up the Artraker Fund and Prize. Her teaching and institutional\u000a      expertise profoundly impacted on\u000a      the nature of the award and helped to situate it as the only one of its\u000a      kind in the world today.\u000a    The Fund and Prize exist to \"help shape and inspire through the medium of\u000a      art how people and\u000a      organisations understand, engage and respond to conflicts, and to become\u000a      the recognised home for\u000a      powerful conflict art and artists.\"\u000a    It uses a three-pronged approach to realize this vision:\u000a    \u000a      Showcasing conflict art as a profound communicative tool to understand\u000a        the complex issues of\u000a        conflict\u000a      Influencing stakeholders &#8212; decision makers, NGOs, the public, art\u000a        critics\u000a      Building relationships and communities with artists and organisations\u000a    \u000a    Buckley's impact on Jagtap can also be seen in her exhibition work. In\u000a      her Deptford X show of 2012\u000a      Jagtap used footage filmed in 2011 to bring visitors face to face with a\u000a      life-size projection of Asari\u000a      Dokubo, the first warlord of the Niger Delta, whose attacks on oil\u000a      installations sent petrol prices\u000a      soaring around the world. In her work, Dokubo speaks about his decision to\u000a      take up arms, his choice\u000a      of violence over non-violence, life in the creeks, his childhood, identity\u000a      and conversion to Islam, and\u000a      his insurgency before being incarcerated seven floors below the State\u000a      intelligence headquarters in\u000a      Abuja. This and other examples demonstrate the correlation between\u000a      Buckley's research on art and\u000a      conflict, Jagtap's practice, and the establishment of Artraker. She is now\u000a      Academic Advisor to the\u000a      Fund. She was invited to act as one of the jurors for the first year of\u000a      the prize (2013), and to sit on\u000a      the Advisory Committee for the Award.\u000a    In its first year the Award attracted over 300 entries from artists and\u000a      practitioners across the world.\u000a      They included some high-profile artists with highly established\u000a      international reputations (e.g. David\u000a      Cotterrell amd Vong Phaophanit, who have exhibited in institutions from\u000a      Tate Modern to Venice\u000a      Biennale), but also from little-known groups and workshop organisers in\u000a      conflict areas from\u000a      Zimbabwe, Korea, Congo, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Georgia, Syria, Iraqi\u000a      Kurdistan, Cameroon, former\u000a      Yugoslavia, Israel, Palestine, Ukraine and many other regions. The jurors\u000a      included experts from both\u000a      the art and peace-making and peace-building disciplines to assess the\u000a      submissions to the Artraker\u000a      Fund. This is a unique situation in terms of art awards, and is the only\u000a      one of its kind in the world. By\u000a      bringing together these diverse communities of practitioners, the Fund\u000a      opened up ground for\u000a      exchange between peace-makers and peace-builders, and artists operating in\u000a      this environment\u000a      while using very different kinds of methodologies. In this way, its impact\u000a      is already a significant one,\u000a      offering challenges to existing conventions on how to judge art.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Buckley's research on the relationship between art and conflict has led\u000a      to the establishment of the\u000a      Artraker Fund. The Fund was established in 2012 and awards art that helps\u000a      raise awareness,\u000a      communicate, stimulate debate and transform our understanding of war,\u000a      violent conflict and social\u000a      upheaval. It is intended to show how art can play a central role in\u000a      transforming our understanding\u000a      and experience of war, violent conflict and social upheaval. Buckley's\u000a      research on the role of art in\u000a      the co-creation of `experiences of freedom' has helped to show why such a\u000a      fund is necessary, and\u000a      to distinguish it from other art prizes.

Her\u000a      research investigates conceptual, aesthetic, material and symbolic\u000a      frameworks of violence in which\u000a      war and art are both implicated. She joined the Department of Politics at\u000a      Goldsmiths as a lecturer\u000a      in 2007 from Newcastle University.\u000a    The catalyst for Buckley's research was the many exhibitions, which\u000a      sprang up in the aftermath of\u000a      9\/11. In 2003 as Head of Education and Research at John Hansard Gallery,\u000a      University of\u000a      Southampton, she was responsible for the Intervention exhibition,\u000a      which explored artists' responses\u000a      to the `War on Terror' and the philosophical contradictions implicit in\u000a      doing so. It did this by asking\u000a      artists `What is the role of art and artists in times of war and terror?'\u000a      Buckley began to build up a\u000a      large back-catalogue of interviews with artists and curators, the purpose\u000a      of which was specifically to\u000a      explore and understand the relationship between art and conflict.\u000a      Questions as to the relationship\u000a      between art and terrorism were further expanded in her `Workshop of Filthy\u000a      Creation' essay,\u000a      published in Review of International Studies;[1]\u000a      wherein, by exploring how contemporary artists deal\u000a      with terror\/ism in their practices, Buckley was also able to scrutinise\u000a      the role of the imagination in the\u000a      construction of experience.\u000a    Buckley's subsequent research returned to these themes in order to\u000a      develop them substantively both\u000a      at research and teaching levels. Her earlier writings, for example,\u000a      `Terrible Beauties' (2) written in\u000a      2005 in response to the Art in the Age of Terrorism exhibition\u000a      (Millais Gallery, Southampton Solent\u000a      University, November, 2004) and published in Coulter-Smith and Owen (Art\u000a        in the Age of Terrorism,\u000a      PHP, London 2005) was instrumental in informing the shape of the new MA\u000a      Art and Politics\u000a      programme which Buckley set about designing on arrival at Goldsmiths in\u000a      2007. One of only three\u000a      such programmes in the world &#8212; the only other two comparable programmes in\u000a      the world were the\u000a      MA in Aesthetics and Politics at Cal Arts and the MA in Arts Politics at\u000a      Tisch School of Arts, NYU\u000a      (Latour's MA in Experiments in Art and Politics was not set up in Sciences\u000a      Po until 2010) &#8212; Buckley's\u000a      essays and research were formative in the design of the new Masters'\u000a      degree at Goldsmiths. Here,\u000a      Buckley was able to consolidate earlier research and present it directly\u000a      in `Art and Politics 1', a\u000a      compulsory core course in the new Masters programme. Following on from Art\u000a        in the Age of\u000a        Terrorism, she was able to show that in times of conflict, art can\u000a      make interventions, which hold the\u000a      potential for meaningful change to occur. In tandem with this, Buckley's\u000a      revised `Terrible Beauties'\u000a      essay was also published in b.rumaria 12 in 2009, alongside other\u000a      key texts by Slovoj &#381;i&#382;ek, Retort,\u000a      WJT Mitchell and Peter Weibel, which also dealt with the relationship\u000a      between art and conflict.\u000a    Since then, Buckley has consolidated and developed her work in subsequent\u000a      publications and at\u000a      international conferences. Building on earlier themes, her work carved out\u000a      a number of different\u000a      strategies for dealing with the role of imagination in the construction of\u000a      experience during times of\u000a      conflict. Here, for example, she wrote a chapter entitled `Mohamed is\u000a      absent. I am Performing:\u000a      Contemporary Iraqi Art and the Destruction of Heritage', in The\u000a        Destruction of Cultural Heritage in\u000a        Iraq, edited by Peter Stone and Joanne Farchakh Bajjaly.(3)\u000a      The essay showed how Iraqi artists, at\u000a      the height of the occupation in Iraq, were nevertheless able to seize a\u000a      moment of opportunity in the\u000a      face of destruction of their heritage. This publication went into\u000a      paperback and in January 2011 was\u000a      awarded the James R Wiseman Book Award by the Archaeological Institute of\u000a      America. The book\u000a      was described, by Times Higher Education, which made it Book of\u000a      the Week, as \"the definitive\u000a      account of the desperate, avoidable cultural tragedy of Iraq for many\u000a      years to come\".\u000a    Disseminating her research at conference level, Buckley was an invited\u000a      speaker at `Medium and\u000a      Message: Conflict Photography in the Digital Era', 3-5 May, 2011,(4)\u000a      an international conference held\u000a      by University College Dublin Clinton Institute's Photography and the\u000a      International Conflict Research\u000a      Centre.

Notably, Clark provided legal advice to an\u000a      ICC trial, at which he successfully challenged the Prosecution's weak\u000a      evidence base against Callixte Mbarushimana, the executive secretary of\u000a      the Forces D&#233;mocratiques de Lib&#233;ration du Rwanda (FDLR), a DRC-based rebel\u000a      group (1, below). In 2010, Mbarushimana had been indicted by the ICC for\u000a      crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in the DRC. In September\u000a      2011, Clark wrote an expert report for the Defence. Drawing on the\u000a      publications discussed in Section 2, Clark's report noted the\u000a      Prosecution's heavy reliance on second-hand evidence published by human\u000a      rights observers, including HRW and the UN Group of Experts on the DRC,\u000a      and challenged the Prosecution's attribution of criminal responsibility to\u000a      the FDLR (and Mbarushimana) on the basis of witnesses' claims that their\u000a      attackers spoke Kinyarwanda, the national language of Rwanda, the FDLR's\u000a      alleged home. The report was central to defence evidence in Mbarushimana's\u000a      pre-trial hearing in The Hague, and was debated at great length. In\u000a      December 2011, the ICC dismissed charges against Mbarushimana on the\u000a      grounds of insufficient evidence. Clark's support of the Defence was\u000a      motivated not by criticism of the ICC, but by the poor quality of the\u000a      evidence brought by the Prosecution, which Clark considered indicative of\u000a      a wider problem: the fallibility of evidence gathered without specific\u000a      understanding of the nature of conflict in the Great Lakes. For Clark, the\u000a      use of such evidence in this case would have further undermined the\u000a      legitimacy of the ICC, thereby undermining post-conflict justice and\u000a      reconciliation in the region (2).\u000a    Clark is also an expert in an on-going case with the UK Crown Prosecution\u000a      Service (CPS), which seeks the extradition to Rwanda of five genocide\u000a      suspects living in the UK. Using Clark's monograph as the primary source\u000a      for information on fair trial standards in Rwanda, senior CPS lawyers\u000a      agreed that there were sufficient grounds to pursue the extradition cases,\u000a      having lost similar cases on appeal in the High Court in 2009. They were\u000a      particularly convinced by Clark's demonstration that genocide suspects\u000a      routinely receive fair trials in Rwanda's gacaca system, and that\u000a      significant shortcomings exist in the methodologies of organisations such\u000a      as HRW (upon whose testimony the 2009 High Court judgements hinged). Clark\u000a      has since conducted further research and compiled an expert report for a\u000a      second set of extradition hearings in March 2014. The CPS is now\u000a      considering actions against other genocide suspects in the UK on the basis\u000a      of Clark's publications and his report, the latter of which was shared\u000a      with prosecutors pursuing extraditions in Norway and the International\u000a      Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Tanzania. These extraditions would mean\u000a      that genocide suspects will be prosecuted in Rwanda by Rwandans, the\u000a      outcome of which will have important implications for strengthening\u000a      domestic law in Rwanda, itself fundamental to maintaining stability in the\u000a      Great Lakes region.\u000a    Additionally, Clark has provided substantial expert advice to the UK\u000a      government. In 2011, he submitted written and oral evidence to the House\u000a      of Commons Select Committee on International Development which was\u000a      re-evaluating donor policy to Rwanda, Burundi and the DRC. Clark's\u000a      invitation arose from his publications and previous appointments to brief\u000a      the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, DFID and UK ambassadors and High\u000a      Commissioners to Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC. Clark's evidence criticised\u000a      the government's proposed withdrawal of aid to Burundi, especially in\u000a      light of planned substantial aid increases to Rwanda and the DRC, and\u000a      advocated regional rather than state-based donor assistance in order to\u000a      advance post-conflict re-building and maintain stability in the Great\u000a      Lakes as a whole. This stance was eventually adopted by the Select\u000a      Committee, whose report to Parliament called for a regional approach (as\u000a      proposed by Clark) and exercised pressure on senior FCO and DFID policy\u000a      makers (3, 4 and 5).\u000a    Similarly, in November 2012, Clark provided written evidence to the House\u000a      of Commons International Development Committee on aid to Rwanda (6). Clark\u000a      questioned the decisions of the UK, US, Germany, the Netherlands and\u000a      Sweden to withdraw or partially withhold aid to Rwanda, decisions based\u000a      primarily on a UN Group of Experts on the DRC report accusing the Rwandan\u000a      government of supporting the M23 rebel group in eastern DRC. Clark\u000a      highlighted the significant methodological problems with this and similar\u000a      reports, and questioned whether a single source should be relied upon so\u000a      extensively in determining policy. Clark's work prompted questions from\u000a      two MPs to the Development Secretary, Justine Greening, during the\u000a      Committee meeting, and was further discussed in a May 2013 briefing paper\u000a      to the House of Commons on political and security developments in Rwanda.\u000a    Internationally, Clark has advised the US State Department, the Danish,\u000a      Australian, Norwegian, Sudanese, Swedish, and Ugandan governments, the\u000a      ICC, International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, UN Group of Experts on\u000a      the DRC, HRW and Crisis Group on conflict-related issues in Rwanda,\u000a      facilitating important policy and legal discussions with practitioners.\u000a    Clark has had a clear influence on international discussion and debate on\u000a      conflict and reconciliation in Africa. This is corroborated by his\u000a      frequent engagement with the media: Since 2010, he has written nine op-eds\u000a      for the Guardian, New York Times (7), International Herald\u000a        Tribune, Huffington Post (10), The Australian and the BBC\u000a      (9) and CNN (8) websites, and has been quoted no fewer than 85 times in\u000a      broadcasts and articles by a wide range of international agencies (11,\u000a      12).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A key challenge for Western policy makers and legal practitioners in\u000a      formulating justice and security responses to mass atrocity in the African\u000a      Great Lakes region is to understand the political, social and cultural\u000a      causes of conflict, and the manner in which past conflicts can be resolved\u000a      and potential future conflicts prevented.

This monograph examines\u000a      how the model of traditional Rwandan conflict resolution, the gacaca\u000a      community justice system, was mobilised in 2001 to prosecute suspected\u000a      perpetrators of the 1994 genocide. The system allowed respected\u000a      individuals elected by local populations to prosecute cases heard in\u000a      open-air before community members. The majority of adult Rwandans\u000a      participated in gacaca, yet the prohibition of lawyers from proceedings\u000a      generated widespread international criticism of the courts' legitimacy.\u000a      Employing original empirical evidence and interviews with hundreds of\u000a      international, national and community stakeholders, Clark counters this\u000a      scepticism, arguing that, while not without problems, mass participation\u000a      in `truth-telling' and accountability has greatly facilitated\u000a      reconciliation. The book offers invaluable insights into a unique approach\u000a      to post-genocide justice and raises the important question of whether\u000a      Rwanda's experience might provide a model for other African nations\u000a      seeking post-conflict resolution.\u000a    Clark's work, drawing heavily on extensive fieldwork, also investigates\u000a      international approaches to post-atrocity accountability and\u000a      reconciliation in Central Africa. In output b, Clark argues that the\u000a      International Criminal Court's (ICC) top-down approach is ill-suited to\u000a      address conflicts in which non-state actors, including tens of thousands\u000a      of everyday citizens, played a significant role. He proposes that\u000a      traditional justice systems implemented in Rwanda and in post-civil war\u000a      Uganda, in contrast, promote forgiveness and heal communities riven by\u000a      violence by holding lower-level, local actors accountable. Similarly,\u000a      output c critiques ICC practices in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)\u000a      and Uganda, asserting that the need to achieve results in the short-term\u000a      has seen it fail to prosecute serving members of government responsible\u000a      for atrocities, while also overlooking the capacity of local forms of\u000a      justice to address such crimes. This approach, Clark contends, has made\u000a      local populations suspicious of the ICC's legitimacy and has serious\u000a      implications for the rule of law in countries where, rather than being\u000a      punished, political actors guilty of serious crimes are ignored or even\u000a      empowered by the ICC's operations.\u000a    Clark's work also controversially questions the practices of human rights\u000a      groups and UN agencies (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch (HRW),\u000a      and UN Groups of Experts) in Central African post-conflict resolution. In\u000a      output d, Clark argues that, with their narrow conception of justice and\u000a      accountability, and questionable evidence-gathering biased by political\u000a      agendas, such groups fail to consider specific transitional contexts and\u000a      customary practices in African countries, and thus undermine the execution\u000a      of justice therein. Ultimately, Clark's research proposes that, for\u000a      genuine, long-term reconciliation to occur, international actors must\u000a      develop a nuanced, country-specific understanding of how conflict plays\u000a      out and is resolved.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42801","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Since 2011-12, Pakistan has catapulted to the top of DFID's global\u000a      funding priorities, and the lion's\u000a      share of DFID's increased funding for Pakistan will focus on education\u000a      (with particular reference to\u000a      the Punjab).\u000a    In January 2013, Nelson was invited to appear as a witness before the\u000a      parliamentary select\u000a      committee for international development to comment on DFID's planned\u000a      increase in investment in\u000a      Pakistan (1, below). During his examination, Nelson raised a number of\u000a      points based on his\u000a      research, noting that: (a) there is no proven direct link between improved\u000a      primary-education-for-all\u000a      and counter-radicalisation, and (b) Punjab-focused funding (n.b. Punjab is\u000a      Pakistan's richest\u000a      province and the provincial stronghold of Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz\u000a      Sharif) may tie DFID\u000a      too closely to the provincial inequalities that have bedevilled Pakistani\u000a      politics for decades. Nelson\u000a      also challenged the common misconception that religious education in\u000a      Pakistan is confined to\u000a      madrasas. Nelson's testimony was referred to at length in the\u000a      International Development\u000a      Committee's Report on Pakistan of April 2013 (2).\u000a    After his appearance, Nelson was contacted to offer follow-up comments\u000a      for the committee. This\u000a      led to the suggestion that, in the context his own research on Pakistan's\u000a      education sector, Nelson\u000a      might gather material concerning patterns of fraud in Pakistan's\u000a      public-sector examinations &#8212;\u000a      patterns that threatened to reduce the impact of DFID's overall investment\u000a      (expected to total well\u000a      over &#163;1 billion). Nelson visited Pakistan to conduct this research,\u000a      following which he produced a\u000a      report that was submitted to the International Development Select\u000a      Committee in June 2013 (3).\u000a    Nelson's follow-up report was cited by Malcolm Bruce MP during the debate\u000a      (4). Specifically, Bruce\u000a      commented on Nelson's finding that, while `appointing teachers on merit'\u000a      is a sound objective,\u000a      `merit' is `for sale' in Pakistan (via bogus exam scores) and is, in fact,\u000a      being bought on a large\u000a      scale. Alan Duncan, Minister of State for International Development,\u000a      commented that he\u000a      appreciated Bruce's comments on merit and standards overall, and offered\u000a      assurance that DFID\u000a      would be working with Pakistani authorities to reduce corruption in\u000a      education.\u000a    Nelson's research also informed a FCO study on religious networks and\u000a      non-religious educational\u000a      institutions in Bangladesh in 2009. This study expanded Nelson's\u000a      contribution (output d) to a 2009\u000a      National Bureau of Asian Research (NBR) report, `Islamic Education in\u000a      Bangladesh and Pakistan:\u000a      Trends in Tertiary Institutions', focusing on the student wings of\u000a      mainstream political parties like\u000a      Bangladesh's Jama'at-e-Islami as well as student ties to international\u000a      religious-cum-political\u000a      movements like Hizb-ut-Tahrir (5). Nelson documented a trend towards the\u000a      political `domestication'\u000a      of international religious activism &#8212; a trend in which, over time,\u000a      political mobilisation focusing on\u000a      international issues (e.g. criticism of India, the US or the UK) became\u000a      less important than political\u000a      mobilisation focused on pressing domestic issues (e.g. unemployment and\u000a      corruption).\u000a    As noted above, this policy-relevant research [text removed for\u000a      publication], focusing on the\u000a      political activism of university students, grew out of earlier research on\u000a      religious education in\u000a      primary and secondary schools across both Bangladesh and Pakistan.

Nelson)\u000a    ","UKLocation":[],"UKRegion":[],"UOA":"Politics and International Studies","UnderpinningResearch":"\u000a    Matthew Nelson is a Reader in the Department of Politics at SOAS, where\u000a      he has taught since\u000a      2006, and is a founding member of the Centre for the Study of Pakistan,\u000a      the Centre for\u000a      Comparative Political Thought, and the Centre for the International\u000a      Politics of Conflict, Rights, and\u000a      Justice. Prior to joining SOAS, he held faculty positions at UC Santa\u000a      Cruz, Bates College, and Yale\u000a      University. Nelson's research focuses on Islam and politics in South Asia,\u000a      focusing primarily on the\u000a      politics of Islamic law and Islamic education, particularly in Pakistan\u000a      and Bangladesh. He has spent\u000a      several years conducting archival, ethnographic, and survey-based research\u000a      in both countries.\u000a    Nelson's research on education in Pakistan and Bangladesh employs\u000a      innovative surveys to\u000a      document `part-time' enrolments that include both religious training in\u000a      public or private-sector\u000a      schools and, simultaneously, educational engagements with the religious\u000a      scholars (ulema) based\u000a      in local madrasas (educational institutions for the study of Islam). This\u000a      approach goes well beyond\u000a      the crude enrolment data used by government officials in South Asia and\u000a      multilateral donors like\u000a      the World Bank (outputs a, c, e, and f). He also works with university\u000a      students to document the\u000a      extracurricular engagements of higher-education students within globalised\u000a      religious organisations\u000a      like the Tablighi Jama'at and Dawat-e-Islami, both non-political Islamic\u000a      movements, and Hizb-ut-\u000a      Tahrir, an international Islamic movement with explicit political\u000a      aspirations (outputs b and d). In\u000a      Bangladesh, initial research on primary and secondary-school students\u000a      [text removed for\u000a      publication] (output e) led to follow-up research with university students\u000a      [text removed for\u000a      publication] (output b).\u000a    Nelson's wide-ranging approach to the politics of religious education,\u000a      facilitated by an extensive\u000a      network of grassroots contacts, has made it possible to challenge the\u000a      conventional view that\u000a      religious education is particularly popular amongst the poorly educated\u000a      lower classes in\u000a      Bangladesh and Pakistan (outputs a, e, and f). This finding, in turn, has\u000a      provided a crucial\u000a      evidence base for moving away from a counter-productive blanket\u000a      demonisation of madrasa-based\u000a      education while, at the same time, allowing for a deeper understanding of\u000a      religious education\u000a      amongst elites. Such issues are explored in outputs b and d, which trace\u000a      the religious activism of\u000a      the educated urban middle classes and demonstrate that, within this group,\u000a      the most active\u000a      students are frequently drawn from those who complete degrees in\u000a      non-religious subjects like\u000a      business, science, and engineering.\u000a    Nelson combines a close textual analysis of curricular content across\u000a      many different types of\u000a      schools with in-depth interviews (facilitated by his fluency in Urdu) to\u000a      challenge prevailing\u000a      assumptions in which religious-cum-political ideas are tied solely to\u000a      enrolment patterns (private-\u000a      school students think `X'; madrasa-based students think `Y'; and so on).\u000a      In doing so, he shows how\u000a      individuals interpret what they learn across simultaneous (`part-time')\u000a      engagements with several\u000a      different educational settings, drawing attention to the ways in which\u000a      politically significant patterns\u000a      of tolerance\/intolerance regarding sectarian and doctrinal difference are\u000a      produced (output a).\u000a      Nelson's more flexible account of religious-cum-political ideas allows for\u000a      a nuanced understanding\u000a      of the specific conditions (both within and beyond particular educational\u000a      institutions) that produce\u000a      religiously informed patterns of conflict and cooperation.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43069","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Nudge based strategies are an important and proliferating feature of\u000d\u000a      policy agendas, nationally and internationally, across diverse policy\u000d\u000a      areas, notably, environment, health and finance. Our research has\u000d\u000a      supported both the appropriate use of such strategies and a critical\u000d\u000a      awareness among policy makers of the dilemmas involved in such\u000d\u000a      interventions. For example, Sue Goss, Principal of the Office for Public\u000d\u000a      Management acknowledges `the impact that Gerry's research Nudge, Nudge,\u000d\u000a        Think, Think has had on the work that OPM has published on behaviour\u000d\u000a        change' noting `his research into the best ways to persuade the\u000d\u000a        public to change thinking and actions has been invaluable' [5.1].\u000d\u000a      After his most recent appearance on the Today programme (3 May\u000d\u000a      2013) where Stoker used this research to raise concerns about how future\u000d\u000a      development of Nudge strategies would have to recognise the need to\u000d\u000a      combine with other approaches and tackle ethical concerns about\u000d\u000a      interventions, he was invited to meet with Owain Service, Deputy Director\u000d\u000a      of the Behavioural Insights Team (UK Cabinet Office) to discuss how the\u000d\u000a      BIT should best meet these challenges [5.2].\u000d\u000a    The 2009 Political Quarterly article `Nudge, Nudge, Think, Think'\u000d\u000a      was immediately picked up by the Chief Executive of the RSA, Matthew\u000d\u000a      Taylor, who referred to it on his blog as a \"brilliant paper\". The monthly\u000d\u000a      statistics for Taylor's blog are 13,000 views and 3,698 hits. The blog is\u000d\u000a      widely influential with governments, think tanks and consultancies [5.3].\u000d\u000a      The importance of the research was recognised by the then Minister for\u000d\u000a      Decentralisation, Greg Clark, who chose to make his first public speech on\u000d\u000a      the Big Society at the launch of the final report of research findings for\u000d\u000a      the Rediscovering the Civic project on 23 June 2010. In the\u000d\u000a      accompanying press release he praised the research for \"[showing] that\u000d\u000a        citizens together can create the Big Society\" [5.4]. In a\u000d\u000a      subsequent letter to Stoker (dated 1 July 2010), the Minister added: \"I\u000d\u000a        have taken away with me clear views... in particular about what we\u000d\u000a        should be doing differently here at the Centre in order to generate the\u000d\u000a        trust and support we need to deliver the Big Society. It has given me\u000d\u000a        even greater appetite to understand more about the behaviour and\u000d\u000a        motivations of our citizens... I look forward to a continuing dialogue\u000d\u000a        with you all as we develop and realise our vision for the Big Society\"\u000d\u000a      [5.5]. Clark then wrote the foreword to Nudge, Nudge, Think,\u000d\u000a        Think (2011), describing the book as \"both timely and welcome\" (5.6).\u000d\u000a      (The book itself has been downloaded over 5000 times by the end of 2012.)\u000d\u000a      The dialogue between Clark and Stoker continued in 2012 as they shared a\u000d\u000a      platform at the British Academy discussing the connection between localism\u000d\u000a      and Nudge [5.7].\u000d\u000a    Stoker has taken the work out to senior policy makers in Australia and\u000d\u000a      New Zealand, through the Australian and New Zealand School of Government\u000d\u000a      (ANZSOG), where behaviour change policy has become a feature of state\u000d\u000a      level government in New South Wales and Victoria. Monica Pfeiffer,\u000d\u000a      Director Applied Learning at ANZSOG comments: `Gerry's presentations\u000d\u000a        and publications resulted in a better understanding of the relative\u000d\u000a        merits of different approaches to behaviour change so that governments\u000d\u000a        are more confident about what is worth doing and how; and equally\u000d\u000a        significantly what not to do' [5.8]. Notably Helen Wyn, the\u000d\u000a      Director of the Policy Advisory Group of the Department of Prime Minister\u000d\u000a      and Cabinet in New Zealand (after a presentation by Stoker in Wellington,\u000d\u000a      on 13 September 2012) commented that the Nudge, Nudge, Think, Think\u000d\u000a      book was valuable because it took a critical and empirical stance to the\u000d\u000a      new ideas of behavioural change. She describes the work `as poking a\u000d\u000a        stick at it, asking questions about what is really going to work'.\u000d\u000a      She praises in particular the innovative introduction of the `useful\u000d\u000a      concept of think' alongside the established work on nudge and concludes: `your\u000a        work helps to raise awareness about applications and their limitations'\u000d\u000a      [5.9].\u000d\u000a    Media interest in the research has increased public awareness of civic\u000d\u000a      behaviour as well as related concepts such as the Big Society. Stoker was\u000d\u000a      interviewed, for example, about Nudge by Radio 4's Today programme\u000d\u000a      on 23 August 2010, 8 June 2011 and 3 May 2013. He also participated in a\u000d\u000a      BBC South documentary, broadcast in Autumn 2011, about the prospects for\u000d\u000a      the Big Society. In addition, Stoker and Smith have made numerous\u000d\u000a      presentations of the research to practitioner audiences and the take up of\u000d\u000a      the work by consultancies has increased its impact at an operational level\u000d\u000a      [5.10].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Centre for Citizenship, Globalisation and Governance (C2G2) at the\u000d\u000a      University of Southampton is at the forefront of increasingly important\u000d\u000a      policy and practice considerations about how to enhance civic behaviour\u000d\u000a      using forms of intervention beyond legislation and taxation. Its research\u000d\u000a      in this field has influenced the UK government's approach to the concept\u000d\u000a      of the Big Society and has helped shape the broader debate on how nudging\u000d\u000a      behaviour change can reshape public service delivery.

Both Stoker and\u000d\u000a      Smith were at Southampton during the whole of the study. The programme\u000d\u000a      considered different ideas to promote civic behaviour, including `nudge'\u000d\u000a      concepts (focusing on social cues and signals, introducing small\u000d\u000a      incentives and harnessing peer pressure) and `think' strategies (asking\u000d\u000a      people to reflect on, discuss and deliberate over information provided).\u000d\u000a      As a result, the research drew on research on both behavioural economics\u000d\u000a      and democratic innovations. Experimental methods were applied to provide\u000d\u000a      robust evaluations of different interventions used to increase a range of\u000d\u000a      types of civic behaviour such as recycling, petitioning, voting and\u000d\u000a      volunteering. More specifically, randomised controlled trials and\u000d\u000a      qualitative design experiments demonstrated how different techniques work\u000d\u000a      in practice and how that practice is made more effective. These\u000d\u000a      field-based, large-scale experiments involved working in partnership with\u000d\u000a      various organisations, including the NHS (e.g. Blood and Transplant),\u000d\u000a      local authorities (e.g. Wiltshire County Council) and voluntary\u000d\u000a      organisations (e.g. EMERGE). The programme of research was influential in\u000d\u000a      the further exploitation of field and design experiments within political\u000d\u000a      science [3.2] and public policy [3.3].\u000d\u000a    The key findings were captured in a book, Nudge, Nudge, Think, Think:\u000d\u000a        Using Experiments to Change Civic Behaviour (2011) [3.4], as\u000d\u000a      well as outputs directed at policymakers in the UK [3.5] and\u000d\u000a      internationally [3.6]. The research demonstrated the importance of\u000d\u000a      both the type of message the citizen receives, such as canvassing or\u000d\u000a      giving feedback, and the particular design of the institutional\u000d\u000a      arrangement, which may allow for debate and the provision of default\u000d\u000a      options.\u000d\u000a    This work has led to related funded research. In collaboration with\u000d\u000a      researchers at Birmingham University, Stoker has conducted a survey-based\u000d\u000a      investigation into citizen engagement in co-production as part of the AHRC\u000d\u000a      Connected Communities programme (2011-2012) [G2]. Smith is the PI\u000d\u000a      on an interdisciplinary (social science\/engineering) RCUK-funded project\u000d\u000a      employing experimental research to investigate the impact of community\u000d\u000a      interventions aiming to alter domestic energy use (2011-14), which has\u000d\u000a      involved engagement with the Department of Energy and Climate Change [G3].\u000d\u000a      Stoker is also CI on an ESRC-funded research project using experimental\u000d\u000a      methods to analyse co-production which started in 2013 [G4].\u000d\u000a      Citizen contributions to public goods are regarded as increasingly\u000d\u000a      important by researchers and policy-makers. This research uses the\u000d\u000a      randomised controlled trials to test interventions that could encourage\u000d\u000a      co-production and will be of direct benefit to practitioners and policy\u000d\u000a      makers connected to public service. The work involves collaboration with\u000d\u000a      university student volunteering services, the National Trust and a range\u000d\u000a      of English parish councils.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43070","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This research has had three distinct impacts:\u000a    \u000a      Shaping the understanding and attitude of governmental and\u000a        non-governmental actors to\u000a        issues of political disaffection and re-engagement.\u000a      Informing the design of participatory projects and other mechanisms as\u000a        responses to the\u000a        issues of anti-politics by institutional actors.\u000a      Playing a pivotal role in the development of a critical resource for\u000a        designing civic participation.\u000a    \u000a    Shaping understanding and attitudes\u000a    The credibility of asset transfer and community ownership and control\u000a      policies that were key\u000a      mechanisms in Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act\u000a      (2009) was\u000a      established by Smith and Stoker's research on Empowering Communities. The\u000a      impact continues:\u000a      as a leading civil servant commented: \"Southampton University's\u000a        research has had a long-term\u000a        impact on DCLG policy under Labour and Coalition governments. Gerry\u000a        Stoker and his team have\u000a        enormous credibility. \" (Ariana Haberis, DCLG) [5.1].\u000a    The anti-politics research led by Stoker provided the basis for an\u000a      article published in the ESRC's\u000a      annual newsstand magazine Britain in 2013 which reaches a wide\u000a      audience (15k copies sold and\u000a      an average of two readers a copy). The evidence to the Leveson Inquiry on\u000a      the role of the media\u000a      was accepted [5.2] and its impact on politics was picked up and\u000a      used by Lord Puttnam [5.3] in his\u000a      campaigning around the issues. Stoker's British Academy publication led to\u000a      an invitation in 2013 to\u000a      develop with St George's House, Windsor Castle, a consultation with\u000a      high-level governmental and\u000a      non-governmental actors to discuss disenchantment with politics and its\u000a      implications for\u000a      democracy [5.4]. The Hansard Society used the research with Stoker\u000a      to offer a range of\u000a      workshops aimed at policy makers and practitioners in 2012\/13 to raise\u000a      awareness and inform\u000a      practice.\u000a    International impact is concretely demonstrated by the decision of the\u000a      German-based pan-European\u000a      Bertelsmann Foundation to use Smith's research as the basis on which to\u000a      develop\u000a      criteria for the Reinhard Mohn Prize on innovative participatory\u000a      approaches worldwide as part of\u000a      their programme to raise awareness about citizen participation innovations\u000a      among senior German\u000a      politicians [5.5]. At the same time, the significance and reach of\u000a      the research is demonstrated by\u000a      invitations to address policy audiences concerning its finding. For\u000a      example, in September 2012,\u000a      Stoker presented findings on the causes of political disenchantment and\u000a      how to respond under the\u000a      auspices of the Australian and New Zealand School of Government in\u000a      Auckland which led directly\u000a      to a follow-up discussion of the research based on Australian data in\u000a      Canberra in Parliament\u000a      House on 26th June 2013 attended by a range of Federal-level politicians\u000a      and civil servants as\u000a      well as journalists [5.6]. In addition Stoker on 18th September\u000a      2013 presented the findings at an\u000a      international symposium `The Second Members Building of the House of\u000a      Representatives' in\u000a      Tokyo, Japan, which was attended by leading politicians and civil\u000a      servants. [5.7]\u000a    Informing the design of civic participation by other institutional\u000a        actors\u000a    The World Bank has taken up (and slightly adapted) the innovative\u000a      analytical framework developed\u000a      by Smith in order to compare and evaluate their own interventions, while\u000a      Smith's research on\u000a      `mini-publics' as a form of effective public consultation has led directly\u000a      to the Bank's advocacy of\u000a      their use by a number of governments. The Bank is designing international\u000a      pilot schemes directly\u000a      based on this research [5.8]. Stoker's work on anti-politics and\u000a      engagement led to an invitation to\u000a      provide advice about the format (consisting of 33 politicians and 66\u000a      ordinary citizens selected at\u000a      random) of a constitutional convention (CC) launched in the Republic of\u000a      Ireland at a two day event\u000a      in Dublin early in November 2012. The same work was used in 12 March 2013\u000a      in response to an\u000a      invitation from the Brazilian Government to advise on public engagement\u000a      strategies [5.9].\u000a    Playing a pivotal role in the development of a critical resource for\u000a        designing civic participation\u000a    Participedia &#8212; an international, Harvard-led knowledge e-platform\u000a      designed to provide information\u000a      about global strategies in citizen participation to practitioners,\u000a      activists and government officials &#8212; has\u000a      adopted Smith's framework as the basis on which Participedia's own data\u000a      collection is\u000a      structured, and many of the innovations he researched have served as test\u000a      cases for the project.\u000a      Subsequently, in 2009, Smith was invited to join the steering board of\u000a      Participedia which is\u000a      supported and has been used by major organisations including the Chilean\u000a      Innovation Programme,\u000a      European Institute for Public Participation, Institute for Local\u000a      Government (US), Involve (UK),\u000a      Deliberative Democracy Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation (USA) and\u000a      Open Democracy (UK).\u000a      The website has had more than 14,000 unique hits and traffic is\u000a      consistently around 100 visits a\u000a      day [5.10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research from the Centre for Citizenship, Globalisation and Governance\u000a      (C2G2) led by Stoker and\u000a      Smith has sought to understand disenchantment with politics in democracies\u000a      and articulate\u000a      responses to this condition.

[3.6]\u000a\u000a    \u000a    This research builds on earlier work by Stoker and Smith. Stoker has\u000a      worked on issues of\u000a      participation and decentralisation since the 1980s with a major and\u000a      internationally-oriented\u000a      statement emerging in his award winning Why Politics Matters\u000a      (2006) which has been translated\u000a      into four other languages, while Smith's report for the Power Inquiry on\u000a      democratic innovation\u000a      provided the empirical basis for Smith's book Democratic Innovations\u000a      (CUP) in which, supported\u000a      by a fellow-member of C2G2 (Owen, Professor of Politics 2008-), he\u000a      developed an innovative and\u000a      original methodological framework for the comparison and evaluation of\u000a      different types of civic\u000a      participation project.\u000a    The Empowering Communities project investigated the role of citizens\u000a      within their local\u000a      communities in, for example, making decisions and running community\u000a      facilities or regeneration\u000a      projects. Through interviews with key stakeholders and an extensive\u000a      literature review of both\u000a      published and grey material, Stoker and Smith identified six key\u000a      mechanisms for supporting\u000a      community self-rule: asset transfer, citizen governance, electronic\u000a      participation, participatory\u000a      budgeting, petitions and redress. They used techniques of systematic\u000a      review to establish the\u000a      success factors behind the implementation of these mechanisms.\u000a    The Anti-Politics project was developed with a leading think tank, the\u000a      Hansard Society. It extends\u000a      the survey analysis of the Hansard Society's annual audit of political\u000a      engagement with a series of\u000a      citizen focus groups to provide a more nuanced understanding of public\u000a      cynicism towards politics\u000a      and the robustness of such attitudes. Stoker and his collaborators found\u000a      that a central source of\u000a      disaffection is the popular judgment that too many politicians are\u000a      self-serving and let special\u000a      interest groups dominate decision-making. The role of the tabloid media in\u000a      confirming the sense of\u000a      anti-politics among citizens is also significant and was reported in\u000a      evidence to the Leveson Inquiry.\u000a      Citizens' reform ideas were explored and found to diverge from the\u000a      standard constitutional reforms\u000a      on offer. Stoker has extended the analysis through a survey of the\u000a      attitudes of Australian citizens\u000a      and with Will Jennings further work in Britain in 2013 looked at the\u000a      difference between active and\u000a      \"standby\" citizens.\u000a    The Austerity project, developed by Jennings and Stoker with YouGov,\u000a      explores factors that might\u000a      explain why in the context of austerity, citizens might see politics as\u000a      failing and finds that it is\u000a      concern about the behaviour of politicians rather than fatalism about the\u000a      capacity of government\u000a      that matters.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43186","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The development sector &#8212; including government, the third sector, and,\u000a      since 1999, the UK's\u000a      Department for International Development (DFID) &#8212; has followed a strategy\u000a      of building support for\u000a      development, monitoring success through annual surveys of public opinion.\u000a      With expenditure cuts\u000a      and a ring-fenced aid budget, public attitudes to development have become\u000a      salient in policy terms.\u000a      The research addressed these issues and has had a demonstrable and\u000a      material impact upon\u000a      thinking, policy and practice through three channels:\u000a    \u000a      It has reshaped DFID's approach to surveying public attitudes towards\u000a        development as well\u000a        as the OECD's proposed global poll;\u000a      It has reshaped the debate across the sector through the Finding\u000a          Frames Report;\u000a      It has shaped the #IF Campaign's work on Monitoring, Evaluation, and\u000a        Learning.\u000a    \u000a    1. DFID and OECD surveys on public support for development\u000a    In January 2009 the UK House of Commons International Development\u000a      Committee (IDC), noting\u000a      that public support is essential to an effective development policy,\u000a      launched an inquiry into Aid\u000a        Under Pressure, to which the UCL researchers submitted evidence. The\u000a      evidence, based on the\u000a      underlying research above, argued that DFID did not know as much as it\u000a      could or should about the\u000a      nature of public support for development in the UK [1]. The submitted\u000a      evidence was later written up\u000a      in [a] and [b]. That evidence suggested that the survey data was based on\u000a      a question badly\u000a      adapted to gauging levels of support. In particular it tapped concern in\u000a      general rather than a more\u000a      valid indicator such as support for government spending on development\u000a      assistance in relation to\u000a      other parts of the budget such as the NHS, police, jobseeker's allowance.\u000a      DFID also failed to\u000a      explore or control for relevant individual covariates of support &#8212; such as\u000a      political attitudes,\u000a      knowledge, or newspaper readership &#8212; which would allow for a more\u000a      fine-grained approach to `the\u000a      public'. On the basis of the written evidence we were invited to give oral\u000a      evidence to the IDC, which\u000a      we did in March 2009 [2].\u000a    The evidence formed the backbone of Chapter 4 of the Committee's final\u000a      report [3]. (See, in\u000a      particular, notes 220, 221, 225 and 228 and pp. 62-3.) It challenged\u000a      existing practice, with the\u000a      Report noting that \"The Secretary of State told us that the question of\u000a      the methodology used in\u000a      DFID's surveys was not one that the Department had considered.\" [3, pp.\u000a      44-45]. One of the\u000a      Report's recommendations was:\u000a    \"If DFID is to build public support for development effectively it needs\u000a      first to establish what\u000a      people's attitudes are. This requires the collection of information that\u000a      truly reflects public\u000a      opinion. We do not believe that DFID's surveys, as they are currently\u000a      designed, achieve\u000a      this. They focus on whether people are concerned about poverty, rather\u000a      than whether they\u000a      would support increased funding for development, nor do they attempt to\u000a      assess the relative\u000a      importance people place on development compared to domestic policy areas\u000a      such as health\u000a      and education. We recommend that DFID examines how it assesses the level\u000a      of public\u000a      support for development and redesigns its surveys to address the\u000a      weaknesses we have\u000a      identified.\" [3, p. 45]\u000a    The recommendation was taken up by DFID and alterations were made to the\u000a      national survey of\u000a      public attitudes towards development from 2009 onwards. An explanation of\u000a      the new measures of\u000a      support was provided near the beginning of the 2009 Survey Report, which\u000a      directly cites the IDC\u000a      recommendation that came from our research:\u000a    \"The IDC Aid Under Pressure report in June 2009 suggested that the DFID\u000a      attitudinal\u000a      survey, as previously conducted, did not effectively establish people's\u000a      support for\u000a      development aid. In particular, it questioned the usefulness of the\u000a      measure of `concern'\u000a      towards poverty in developing countries and argued that it might be more\u000a      helpful to ask\u000a      what priority should be given to increased spending on development\u000a      assistance compared\u000a      to other policy areas, such as the NHS or law and order, so as to\u000a      establish its relative\u000a      importance. In response to this, the most recent wave included two new\u000a      questions to\u000a      establish these priorities. Respondents were asked to consider a number of\u000a      global or\u000a      international issues (16 in total) where taxpayers' money is spent and to\u000a      select their top five\u000a      most important for the Government to spend money on. In addition, they\u000a      were asked to\u000a      prioritise support for poor countries relative to five domestic issues,\u000a      ranking those issues in\u000a      order of priority, a question previously asked in the segmentation study.\"\u000a      [4, p. 3]\u000a    More recently, the OECD &#8212; which is the main bilateral aid forum &#8212; has\u000a      started work on a cross-national\u000a      survey into public support for development. A `roadmap' has been\u000a      commissioned for this\u000a      Global Solidarity Opinion Poll [5]. The report cites our research, noting\u000a      that: \"the most important\u000a      issue to be settled for any public opinion poll: to ensure what it is that\u000a      we want to measure and\u000a      then to look at how to do that. The former starts with acknowledging that\u000a      support, opinion, attitude,\u000a      knowledge, awareness (which are often used interchangeably) are in reality\u000a      different concepts.\"\u000a    2. The Finding Frames Report and best practice\u000a        in the UK development sector\u000a    The highly influential Finding Frames report was published in\u000a      2010 by Oxfam and the umbrella\u000a      organisation for British Overseas NGOs for Development (BOND) [6]. The\u000a      report argues that the\u000a      way in which `development' is presented to the pubic matters and has\u000a      definitively shifted the\u000a      debate in the UK development sector &#8212; helping cement the idea that a\u000a      deeper, more complex\u000a      conversation is necessary [7]. The report draws on a rich psychological\u000a      literature on values and\u000a      behaviour to develop an argument for `reframing' how development is\u000a      presented to the public, for\u000a      example to move away from notions of charity or aid towards justice and\u000a      dialogue. The report\u000a      notes the distinct lack of evidence about the values that drive public\u000a      engagement with\u000a      development, before identifying the underpinning research as the exception\u000a      and going on to outline\u000a      the arguments of van Heerde and Hudson 2010 [a] and Hudson and vanHeerde\u000a      Hudson [b] [6].\u000a    The Report, influenced by the research, which is explicitly referenced at\u000a      pp. 16, 20, 48-9, and 59,\u000a      has shifted the debate in the sector as well as what is considered best\u000a      practice.\u000a    \u000a      \u000aBest practice: The Finding Frames report has directly\u000a        shaped the design of current large-\u000a        scale campaigning initiatives. For example, in May 2011, Oxfam launched\u000a        a new 4-year\u000a        global campaign across all 17 of its country organisations called GROW\u000a        [8]. The campaign\u000a        was explicitly designed using the Finding Frames report [8].\u000a        Other key initiatives, such as\u000a        the Global Poverty Project's 1 Billion Reasons, the Gates\u000a        Foundation, and the 2013 #IF\u000a        Campaign (see below), use the Finding Frames report to design\u000a        their public engagement\u000a        work.\u000a      \u000aDebate: The most recent report on UK public attitudes, jointly\u000a        published by Institute for\u000a        Public Policy Research and the Overseas Development Institute [9], picks\u000a        up on our\u000a        arguments about moral vs. self-interested framing, citing both our\u000a        published papers. They\u000a        conclude that attempts by DFID \"to reframe the case for development as\u000a        being in Britain's\u000a        self-interest do not resonate as much as approaches that focus on what\u000a        is `right' or fair.\" [9,\u000a        p. 23]. The report has helped shift the public and media debate, with\u000a        this specific finding\u000a        being reported in The Guardian and the New Statesman.\u000a    \u000a    The #IF Campaign\u000a    In anticipation of the June 2013 G8 meeting in the UK, over 100\u000a      organisations came together in a\u000a      coalition to launch the #IF Campaign in January 2013. The campaign had\u000a      four main demands: aid\u000a      increases, stopping land grabs and tax dodging, and increased financial\u000a      transparency. It aimed to\u000a      change the quality of public engagement with development to secure policy\u000a      change.\u000a    The campaign has a number of key performance indicators, many of which\u000a      pertained to public\u000a      support; the monitoring and evaluation was done through a national poll in\u000a      three waves with a\u000a      sample size of 1,500 from January to June 2013. This was the largest such\u000a      poll in the sector's\u000a      history, and the survey design was explicitly based on Hudson and Hudson's\u000a      research [10] &#8212; with\u000a      their suggested measures of support, additional questions on knowledge,\u000a      political attitudes all\u000a      being used. In early January both researchers were invited to sit on the\u000a      campaign's Monitoring,\u000a      Evaluation, and Learning Working Group to help with the design and\u000a      analysis of further public\u000a      engagement data collection and analysis. Thanks to the research, the\u000a      campaign had `a realistic\u000a      understanding of public support for each stage' enabling it to refine its\u000a      strategies for `maximum\u000a      advocacy impact with the government' [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Hudson and Hudson's research into public attitudes towards international\u000a      development has (1)\u000a      influenced the UK's Department for International Development's approach to\u000a      surveying public\u000a      support. DFID has changed the design of their long-standing survey as a\u000a      result of the research and\u000a      the OECD is incorporating it into the design of its proposed global\u000a      solidarity poll.

It\u000a      was an original investigation into why people do or do not support\u000a      international development\u000a      assistance at the individual level. Existing polling work is limited,\u000a      merely reporting aggregate levels\u000a      of support and is based on weak survey questions. The research shows the\u000a      limits of this approach.\u000a    Two key findings emerge from the research:\u000a    Individual drivers of support for development aid (see [a] Section\u000a      3). Although the UK government\u000a      has increasingly sought to justify development aid in terms of the\u000a      national interest rather than\u000a      framing it in more traditional moral terms, there is virtually no evidence\u000a      on what drives attitudes at\u000a      an individual level. Using national survey data from the Department for\u000a      International Development,\u000a      the research tested whether support for development is correlated with\u000a      self-interested and\/or moral\u000a      reasons for giving aid. Using a binary logistic regression model we found\u000a      differential effects for\u000a      moral and self-interested attitudes on concern for poverty. Individuals\u000a      who believe there are moral\u000a      reasons for granting development aid are more likely to be concerned about\u000a      poverty in developing\u000a      countries. Self-interested attitudes are negatively related to concern. We\u000a      further divided self-interested\u000a      justifications into those that affected individuals personally and those\u000a      that were in the\u000a      national interest: `personally affected' was positively related to concern\u000a      but `national interest' was\u000a      negatively related. The findings have implications for the way in which\u000a      aid is framed in public\u000a      engagement strategies: justice and morality work better than self-interest\u000a      in trying to engage the\u000a      public.\u000a    Survey design and validity (see [b] in section 3). This paper\u000a      provides a critical review of existing\u000a      survey tools used in the UK, US and Europe to collect data on public\u000a      attitudes to development. It\u000a      demonstrates that existing measures suffer from poor measurement validity.\u000a      This is because the\u000a      questions used in the survey instruments are poorly designed and collect\u000a      `cost-free' expressed\u000a      support but do not tap real political support where respondents have to\u000a      make relative judgements\u000a      about the importance of development aid. In addition the paper shows that\u000a      the collected data has\u000a      not been systematically analysed. In particular, reported findings fail to\u000a      control for knowledge-levels\u000a      or perceptions of aid effectiveness, both of which are widely thought to\u000a      affect support. Finally, the\u000a      paper argues that researchers and policymakers have failed to analyse the\u000a      underlying drivers of\u000a      support for development aid in the first place. All of these factors\u000a      undermine the quality of the\u000a      evidence base for policymakers and other stakeholders.\u000a    The research was carried out between April 2008 and the present, by David\u000a      Hudson (Lecturer\u000a      2005-2011, Senior Lecturer 2011-ongoing) and Jennifer van Heerde \/\u000a      Jennifer vanHeerde-Hudson\u000a      (Lecturer 2003--2011, Senior Lecturer 2011-ongoing).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43188","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The House of Commons' Backbench Business Committee, established in 2010,\u000a      is unique in\u000a      comparative terms. With its eight-person membership restricted to\u000a      backbench MPs, who are\u000a      elected by their peers, and a chair elected in a secret ballot by all MPs\u000a      across parties, the\u000a      committee is responsible for scheduling `backbench business' (a new\u000a      category since 2010) in the\u000a      Commons for roughly half a day per week. MPs can bid to the committee for\u000a      topics that they would\u000a      like to see debated, and there is no involvement in this process by party\u000a      leaders. The committee\u000a      particularly encourages proposals that have cross-party support, and\u000a      chooses topics that are\u000a      topical, popular amongst MPs and unlikely to obtain a debate by other\u000a      means. This process is\u000a      widely seen as having promoted a more vibrant and independent House of\u000a      Commons. The reform\u000a      establishing the Committee stemmed from the research conducted by Dr\u000a      Russell and described in\u000a      section 2.\u000a    When the MPs' expenses crisis broke in May 2009, Tony Wright, then the\u000a      Chair of the Public\u000a      Administration Committee, wrote to Gordon Brown proposing that a new\u000a      committee should be\u000a      established to look at options for House of Commons reform. His letter\u000a      drew particular attention to\u000a      the proposals in Russell's report [a], which had been published in 2007\u000a      [1]. Wright had been one of\u000a      the practitioner advisers to the research project, and had taken part in\u000a      the report's launch at\u000a      Westminster. The report had also been circulated to key individuals,\u000a      including the Rt. Hon. Jack\u000a      Straw MP and future Commons Speaker John Bercow MP. Consequently the\u000a      Select Committee on\u000a      Reform of the House of Commons was established, with Wright as chair. When\u000a      it began its work, it\u000a      appointed Dr Russell as its specialist adviser [2]. In its final report\u000a      the committee endorsed the\u000a      central recommendations in The House Rules?.\u000a    One of the Wright Committee's key recommendations was to establish\u000a      `backbench time' and a\u000a      Backbench Business Committee. At that time, Dr Russell's report was the\u000a      only one to make such a\u000a      recommendation, and the arrangements proposed existed in no other\u000a      parliament [3]. This was\u000a      acknowledged in a report from the Backbench Business Committee itself,\u000a      when describing its\u000a      establishment:\u000a    Drawing on research by the UCL Constitution Unit, the Wright Committee\u000a      noted that the\u000a      business committees which operated in other parliaments were often little\u000a      more than an\u000a      institutionalisation of the usual channels. They tended to provide a forum\u000a      for the front\u000a      benches of each party to communicate and were largely exclusive of\u000a      backbenchers. The\u000a      Wright Committee concluded that: Ministers should give up their role in\u000a      the scheduling of\u000a      any business except that which is exclusively Ministerial business,\u000a      comprising Ministerial-sponsored legislation and associated motions, substantive non-legislative\u000a      motions required\u000a      in support of their policies and Ministerial statements. The rest of the\u000a      business currently\u000a      scheduled by Ministers&#8212;such as House domestic business, select committee\u000a      reports and\u000a      general and topical debates&#8212;is for backbenchers to propose and the House\u000a      to decide\u000a      (para. 3 in [3]).\u000a    The committee explicitly rejected an `all-purpose' business committee on\u000a      the basis of the evidence\u000a      supplied in House Rules? [4], and the Backbench Business Committee\u000a      and new category of\u000a      backbench business &#8212; as outlined in the paragraph above &#8212; were closely\u000a      based on the\u000a      recommendations in the original report. Other recommendations from the\u000a      Wright Committee were\u000a      also in tune with Russell's proposals, such as those regarding the process\u000a      for appointing members\u000a      to select committees, but had also been made by other groups, whereas the\u000a      proposal for the\u000a      Backbench Business Committee had not.\u000a    The creation of the new committee was controversial in some circles,\u000a      particularly with party whips,\u000a      who stood to lose control over part of the parliamentary agenda to\u000a      backbenchers. But the reforms\u000a      were debated and agreed in principle at the end of the 2005-10 parliament.\u000a      They were then put in\u000a      place at the start of the 2010 parliament, guided by the new Conservative\u000a      Leader of the House of\u000a      Commons, Sir George Young (who had also been an adviser to Russell's\u000a      original project).\u000a    The Committee came into existence in June 2010, and now schedules debates\u000a      in the chamber\u000a      regularly. Several of these have proved high profile, for example on\u000a      Afghanistan, loan sharking and\u000a      prisoners' voting rights. Others have been important but low profile, for\u000a      example on parliamentary\u000a      reform. None of these would have reached the parliamentary agenda under\u000a      the old system,\u000a      because whips could keep matters off the agenda that were uncomfortable\u000a      for party leaders. The\u000a      highest profile backbench debate of all was that on EU membership, on 24\u000a      October 2011, when 81\u000a      Conservative MPs defied the whip to vote in favour of a referendum [5].\u000a    The existence of the Backbench Business Committee has been widely noted\u000a      to have boosted the\u000a      independence of the House of Commons, and been a healthy development for\u000a      British democracy.\u000a      The Wright Committee's report was described by the Times as `the\u000a      most significant change to the\u000a      way that the House operates in 30 years' [6]. Likewise, the House\u000a        Magazine described the work of\u000a      the new committee under the banner headline `parliament fights back',\u000a      suggesting that it was `at\u000a      the heart of the revitalisation of parliamentary democracy' [7]. Reviews\u000a      of the Committee's\u000a      operation by the House of Commons Procedure Committee [8] and Political\u000a      and Constitutional\u000a      Reform Committee have likewise judged it an important and positive\u000a      development. For example,\u000a      the review by the House of Commons Political and Constitutional Reform\u000a      Committee reported on\u000a      the operation of the Backbench Business Committee in July 2013. It quoted\u000a      the Labour Shadow\u000a      Leader of the House of Commons Angela Eagle's opinion that the new\u000a      committee had become `a\u000a      key avenue for Members wanting to give voice to public concern', and\u000a      Graham Brady MP, chair of\u000a      the Conservative 1922 committee, who noted that `there are debates that\u000a      have been held that the\u000a      Government would not have wished to hold, and that has opened up the\u000a      process and has opened\u000a      it up to public opinion far more' (p. 16 [9]).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The House of Commons' Backbench Business Committee, established in 2010,\u000a      is responsible for\u000a      programming backbench business in the Commons for roughly half a day a\u000a      week.

The\u000a      research focused on business committees, and more broadly on mechanisms by\u000a      which\u000a      parliaments may achieve autonomy from the political executive (e.g. by\u000a      controlling the\u000a      parliamentary timetable, appointments to committees, changes to\u000a      parliamentary procedures, and\u000a      choosing presiding officers or `Speakers').\u000a    The central findings of The House Rules? [a] noted that, from a\u000a      comparative perspective, the\u000a      Commons had a number of features that facilitated parliamentary control of\u000a      its own business. For\u000a      example, the `independence of the Speaker, coupled with a culture where\u000a      informal cross-party\u000a      backbench work and even \"cross voting\" are common, is not found amongst\u000a      any of the\u000a      comparators' (p. 68) and `UK backbenchers have a whole raft of freedoms\u000a      not available to their\u000a      counterparts in New Zealand and Australia' (p. 68). However, the report\u000a      noted that there was still\u000a      pressure `to find a new logic of parliamentary control' (p. 68) and\u000a      comparator parliaments offered\u000a      insights into how control could be further extended. Specifically the\u000a      reports proposed the\u000a      establishment of a Backbench Business Committee and new category of\u000a      backbench business (pp.\u000a      72-7 and recommendations 3-13, p. 9), with the Committee determining the\u000a      timetabling of House\u000a      business. Notably, the report rejected a model of business committees in\u000a      other parliaments that\u000a      gave little control to backbench parliamentarians and were dominated by\u000a      party leaders and whips.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43354","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"458258","Name":"Latvia"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The EU is facing a major identity crisis, not only in terms of handling\u000a      the 2008 financial\/euro crisis but also in terms what the EU aims to\u000a      achieve as a global actor. At the same time, the EU has steadily improved\u000a      its foreign\/security policy capabilities, so that it actually possesses a\u000a      wide range of power resources to implement its goals. The 2009 Treaty of\u000a      Lisbon was supposed to address this apparent incongruity between the EU's\u000a      (underwhelming) global policy performance and its (overwhelming) economic\u000a      resources, yet many observers agree that the Treaty has not performed very\u000a      effectively in terms of raising the EU's international profile or making\u000a      the EU more responsive to its 28 member states and its 500+ million\u000a      citizens.\u000a    These problems have inspired much debate regarding the next steps for\u000a      Europe, particularly in terms of whether to reform the Treaty of Lisbon.\u000a      Smith's large body of research on the EU's global 'actorness' has informed\u000a      this debate in several ways. Initially, the impact involved personal\u000a      conversations with dozens of high-level EU policy-makers. These\u000a      conversations were not one-way interviews but intense exchanges of views\u000a      about the EU's variable performance, and potential, as a global actor.\u000a      Based on these conversations, and thanks to his five-year ERC grant, Smith\u000a      began to consolidate his research into a coherent set of arguments to help\u000a      shape the debate over the EU as a global actor. In November 2010, Smith\u000a      was invited by the Belgian EU presidency to deliver a keynote speech at\u000a      the Flemish Peace Institute on the topic of \"Export Controls and the\u000a      European Defence Market.\" At this event, Smith spoke to nearly 100 senior\u000a      representatives of EU institutions, European defence firms, members of the\u000a      press, and various think tanks. Based on his CSDP research, Smith argued\u000a      that the EU was spending too much time on capacity-building without\u000a      debating the larger question about what interests the EU is attempting to\u000a      protect.\u000a    Following this workshop, Smith drafted a major article on this topic\u000a      (reference #3 above) and the first detailed study of the European\u000a      gendarmerie force (reference #4), which (along with the EU's\u000a      counter-piracy naval operation) demonstrates the EU's expanding efforts to\u000a      coordinate its civilian\/economic instruments with its new\u000a      military\/policing capabilities. In addition to publicizing these works\u000a      through a series of conference presentations and invited lectures, Smith\u000a      also created a Twitter account in 2012 (with over 1,300 followers now) to\u000a      share his views and to facilitate conversations with European\u000a      policymakers, journalists, think tank representatives, academics, PhD\u000a      students, consultants, and interested citizens.\u000a    These efforts coalesced at a major event in May 2013 at the Swedish\u000a      Institute of International Affairs at the final meeting of the European\u000a      Global Strategy (EGS) project, an initiative launched by the Swedish\u000a      foreign minister (Carl Bildt) in cooperation with the foreign ministers of\u000a      Poland, Italy, and Spain. The idea was to initiate a 'track two' think\u000a      tank-led process to inform 'track one' policymaking at the Council of the\u000a      EU meeting regarding the 10th anniversary of the European Security\u000a      Strategy (scheduled for December 2013), and to broaden the debate beyond\u000a      the 'big three' EU member states (France, Germany, and the UK). Four\u000a      leading European think tanks directed the project (the Swedish Institute\u000a      of International Affairs, the Instituto Affari Internazionali, the Polish\u000a      Institute of International Affairs, and the Real Instituto Elcano),\u000a      supported by input from other associated think tanks, foreign policy\u000a      institutes, and academics across Europe.\u000a    At this event, Smith gave a PowerPoint presentation to over 50 academics,\u000a      diplomats, and policymakers from across Europe based on his work.\u000a      Afterwards, his presentation was praised as one of the most important\u000a      interventions made during the meetings of the EGS process, and copies of\u000a      his presentation were requested by several participants. Later the EGS\u000a      organisers publicly thanked Smith through their Twitter account, and the\u000a      final EGS report used Smith's three-level organising scheme\u000a      (internal\/home, regional\/neighbourhood, and global levels of action),\u000a      juxtaposed against three core sets of interests: security interests,\u000a      economic interests, and &#8212; equally important &#8212; the projection of EU values.\u000a      This scheme was explicitly based on Smith's grand strategy article noted\u000a      above, and it provided a useful way for the EGS participants to visualise\u000a      and evaluate how the EU currently ranks its strategic priorities.\u000a    In particular, the final EGS document placed as much emphasis on internal\u000a      EU economic issues as on external political matters, and it prioritised\u000a      the 'neighbourhood' (rather than the global sphere) as the key focus of EU\u000a      foreign policy, as Smith had suggested. Strategy is not only about\u000a      priorities but also about the relations between those priorities (i.e.,\u000a      coherence), and the EU cannot hope to increase its influence at the global\u000a      level without simultaneously enhancing its internal effectiveness and\u000a      legitimacy. Moreover, Smith argued that the EU should lead by example and\u000a      attempt to build support for its foreign policies among European citizens,\u000a      rather than only among officials in Brussels. Following the EGS meeting,\u000a      Smith was invited by the European Council on Foreign Relations to expand\u000a      upon his thinking about EU global strategy as a guest contributor to their\u000a      website blog, in order to help publicise the official release of the EGS\u000a      report two weeks later. Thanks to his input, and on the recommendation of\u000a      the director of the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, Smith was\u000a      invited to speak at a follow-up event (September 2013) on European Global\u000a      Strategy at the Riga Process Workshop, organised by the German Marshall\u000a      Fund, the Latvian Transatlantic Organisation, and the Latvian Foreign\u000a      Ministry. He was also invited to give oral and written evidence to the\u000a      Foreign Affairs Committee of the Finnish Parliament (September 2013) on\u000a      the same topic, to help Finland prepare for the December 2013 Council of\u000a      the EU meeting on European security\/defence.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study focuses on the development of the European Union (EU) as\u000a      a global political\/security actor, particularly regarding the dynamic\u000a      relationship between institution-building, strategic thinking, and policy\u000a      performance.

By analysing evidence about EU\u000a      foreign policy outputs in the form of aggregate data and individual case\u000a      studies, supported by extensive elite interviews, he has consistently\u000a      demonstrated several key drivers behind the EU's global 'actorness': 1) EU\u000a      foreign\/security policy cooperation cannot be explained by realist\u000a      arguments regarding external security threats or US pressure; 2)\u000a      endogenous EU factors (such as norms, 'soft law,' and knowledge) are\u000a      equally, if not more important, than exogenous factors; 3) institutional\u000a      development involving 'bottom up' experiential learning is more important\u000a      than 'top down' intergovernmental bargaining; 4) ideational factors\u000a      ranging from European history to cultural values to an opposition to\u000a      certain US foreign policies have played key roles; and 5) taken together,\u000a      these changes, and the policies they produce, represent a nascent EU\u000a      global or grand strategy in world politics.\u000a    Several of Smith's works, including two award-winning articles, laid the\u000a      foundations for the impacts discussed in this case study. His research\u000a      monograph, Europe's Foreign and Security Policy: The\u000a        Institutionalization of Cooperation (Cambridge University Press,\u000a      2003), is now a standard reference on the governance of EU foreign policy.\u000a      In 'Diplomacy by Decree: The Legalization of EU Foreign Policy' (Journal\u000a        of Common Market Studies 39\/1), Smith showed that informal customs\u000a      and norms of EU foreign policy were becoming not just institutionalised\u000a      but also legalised, with important consequences for the EU's emerging\u000a      constitutional order (best JCMS article of the year award). A year later,\u000a      he produced another influential, and award-winning, article outlining the\u000a      key elements of a theory of EU foreign policy: 'Toward a Theory of EU\u000a      Foreign Policy Making: Multi-level Governance, Domestic Politics, and\u000a      National Adaptation to Europe's Common Foreign and Security Policy' (Journal\u000a        of European Public Policy 11\/4). This article, which won JEPP's\u000a      award for the most downloaded article of the year, attempts to incorporate\u000a      not just core EU institutional factors in Brussels but also elements of\u000a      the domestic politics of EU member states.\u000a    In 2007, based on the track record above, Smith won a five-year (May\u000a      2008-April 2013) European Research Council (ERC) grant (no. 203613) for\u000a      his project 'A European Approach to Conflict Resolution?'. This award, in\u000a      the amount of one million euro, funded his research on the EU's expansion\u000a      into global security affairs, through its new Common Security and Defence\u000a      Policy (CSDP) operations and other policy tools. Smith began publishing\u000a      his findings from this project in 2009, when he accepted an offer to\u000a      relocate from the University of St Andrews to the University of Aberdeen.\u000a      For this project, Smith has developed a theory of experiential\u000a      institutional learning to demonstrate how the EU uses the CSDP primarily\u000a      as a capacity-building tool in order to test and expand its capacities as\u000a      a global security actor.\u000a    A research monograph based on this project is nearing completion.\u000a      However, several of Smith's publications funded by the ERC grant have\u000a      already addressed the debate over the EU's legitimacy and effectiveness as\u000a      a global political\/security actor. He co-authored the first detailed\u000a      analysis of the EU's counter-piracy naval operation to explain how the EU\u000a      defines its security interests (in Contemporary Security Policy\u000a      30\/3), followed by a comprehensive assessment of the state of EU\u000a      foreign\/security policy in the prestigious International Studies\u000a      Compendium project after he moved to Aberdeen (reference #1). The EU's\u000a      attempts to devise a more 'comprehensive approach' became part of the\u000a      empirical evidence used by Smith to examine the role of learning in EU\u000a      foreign policy; this argument appeared in an edited volume by Oxford\u000a      University Press (reference #2). In 2011, Smith published an influential\u000a      article on the emergence and implications of an EU 'grand strategy' in\u000a      world politics (reference #3). This piece offered a conceptual framework\u000a      to map and evaluate how various EU global actions serve particular EU\u000a      interests. Moreover, while some scholars argue that the EU needs a grand\u000a      or global strategy, Smith demonstrated that the EU already had such a\u000a      strategy; the problem was in implementing it coherently through the EU's\u000a      existing institutional framework.\u000a    Finally, in 2013 Smith authored studies of two major new elements of EU\u000a      foreign\/security policy cooperation. One co-authored article examined the\u000a      gestation and performance of the European Gendarmerie Force (reference\u000a      #4), which seems to have created much confusion across the EU regarding\u000a      the role of standing police forces in CSDP operations. The second article\u000a      was part of a special symposium organised and edited by Smith for the Journal\u000a        of European Public Policy on the EU's new European External Action\u000a      Service (EEAS). Smith's contribution (reference #5) offered a critical\u000a      analysis of the performance of the EEAS, arguing that a combination of\u000a      intergovernmental and bureaucratic politics has seriously interfered with\u000a      the effective functioning of this new body. In particular, the EU's\u000a      development and security agendas have been in conflict since the EEAS was\u000a      created, which undermines the EU's attempts to devise a 'comprehensive\u000a      approach' to conflict prevention and resolution. Taken together, these\u000a      publications provide a critical mass of theory- informed analysis,\u000a      supported by original evidence, regarding the performance and potential of\u000a      European foreign\/security policy.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43355","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A critical challenge to Scotland's new system of devolved government is\u000d\u000a      the making and\u000d\u000a      implementation of public policy in areas where Scotland has primary or\u000d\u000a      sole authority.

Seminar participants included senior civil servants\u000d\u000a      from the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government, Wales, and Whitehall, officials of agencies, and academic\u000d\u000a      colleagues from Scotland\u000d\u000a      and other European countries. The project's final report was published in\u000d\u000a      the journal Scottish\u000d\u000a        Affairs (Winter 2011), and individual papers from the seminars were\u000d\u000a      published as a special issue of\u000d\u000a      Regional and Federal Studies (22\/3: 2012), edited by Keating and\u000d\u000a      Cairney.\u000d\u000a    Between 2008-11 Michael Keating and Richard Rose ran the `Scotland in the\u000d\u000a      World' seminars,\u000d\u000a      bringing distinguished academics to Scotland to lecture to mixed\u000d\u000a      academic-practitioner audiences.\u000d\u000a      The principal aim of these events was to allow international public policy\u000d\u000a      experts to contribute their\u000d\u000a      experience of working in a world of interdependent states and to broaden\u000d\u000a      ongoing conversations\u000d\u000a      on Scotland's constitutional future though events aimed at policy advisers\u000d\u000a      and directors, civil\u000d\u000a      servants, parliamentarians, the diplomatic corps, and media\u000d\u000a      correspondents. The series was\u000d\u000a      launched by the First Minister and seminars were attended by prominent\u000d\u000a      politicians, civil servants,\u000d\u000a      European Commission and European Parliament officials, and members of the\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh consular\u000d\u000a      corps. In the Forum's inaugural lecture (04\/02\/08), First Minister Alex\u000d\u000a      Salmond said, \"The Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government has launched a National Conversation with the people of\u000d\u000a      Scotland. This conversation\u000d\u000a      is about the country that we wish to be &#8212; and the changes we must make to\u000d\u000a      meet our ambitions...\u000d\u000a      The Forum that we are launching today will be a major part of this\u000d\u000a      conversation, drawing in views\u000d\u000a      across the academic world and internationally.\"\u000d\u000a    Since the launch, Forum speakers have included the Prime Minister of\u000d\u000a      Finland and Jeffrey\u000d\u000a      Weinberg, legislative attorney to the White House Office of Management and\u000d\u000a      Budget. A seminar\u000d\u000a      on the experience of Catalonia was attended by the former Presiding\u000d\u000a      Officer of the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Parliament, the former First Minister, and prominent figures in Scottish\u000d\u000a      public life. A seminar on\u000d\u000a      the Irish experience was attended by the consuls-general of Ireland and\u000d\u000a      Germany, the Scottish\u000d\u000a      representative to the EU, and the representatives in Scotland of the\u000d\u000a      European Commission and the\u000d\u000a      European Parliament. These events, informed by Keating's large body of\u000d\u000a      comparative research on\u000d\u000a      policy learning, gave sub-national (or devolved) policy-makers from\u000d\u000a      several European countries the\u000d\u000a      opportunity to share practical ideas and best practices regarding their\u000d\u000a      own experiences with this\u000d\u000a      form of governance.\u000d\u000a    In 2010, Keating was invited by the Scottish Government to lead a series\u000d\u000a      of training courses on\u000d\u000a      policy skills, with a team drawn from five universities. The basic text is\u000d\u000a      Keating's book The\u000d\u000a        Government of Scotland. The course has been run eight times for\u000d\u000a      around 20 civil servants on\u000d\u000a      each occasion. Departing from the conventional training format, it\u000d\u000a      introduces key ideas and\u000d\u000a      concepts, then provides an opportunity for civil servants to reflect on\u000d\u000a      their own experiences and\u000d\u000a      explore the scope for, and constraints on, policy innovation, particularly\u000d\u000a      during times of public\u000d\u000a      spending reductions. Evaluations have consistently been highly positive;\u000d\u000a      the course employs\u000d\u000a      teaching materials developed as part of Keating's ESRC Devolution and\u000d\u000a      Public Policy research\u000d\u000a      and Cairney was a member of the teaching team until February 2013. Also in\u000d\u000a      2010, Keating was\u000d\u000a      invited to participate in meetings to discuss the Scottish Government's\u000d\u000a      policy-making framework\u000d\u000a      and its contribution to the UK reform programme. This fed into the reform\u000d\u000a      of policy-making and the\u000d\u000a      Scottish policy cycle, although not all the nuances introduced by the\u000d\u000a      academic participants\u000d\u000a      survived. He also presented at a meeting of local authority\u000d\u000a      representatives on the reform of\u000d\u000a      cohesion policy organized by the European Commission representative in\u000d\u000a      Scotland.\u000d\u000a    Keating has been closely involved in regular discussions about\u000d\u000a      establishing a more permanent\u000d\u000a      policy institute for Scotland. He collaborated with Robert Black, recently\u000d\u000a      retired Auditor General,\u000d\u000a      on this, chairing two stakeholders' meetings in the summer of 2011. The\u000d\u000a      outcome was the Royal\u000d\u000a      Society of Edinburgh's (RSE) Fellows Public Services Reform Group, which\u000d\u000a      it is hoped will develop\u000d\u000a      in the years to come. Keating also contributed to the RSE submission on\u000d\u000a      the impact of the Lisbon\u000d\u000a      Treaty on Scotland. The resulting Advice Paper was alluded to in a\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary debate on\u000d\u000a      09\/12\/10, when Helen Eadie, MSP, said: `I refer to the evidence that was\u000d\u000a      given by Professor\u000d\u000a      Michael Keating, who said it is vital that the Parliament agrees &#8212; among\u000d\u000a      others &#8212; the committee's\u000d\u000a      recommendation that there be established a formal mechanism for dispute\u000d\u000a      resolution covering all\u000d\u000a      areas where the UK as a member state, may have a different opinion from\u000d\u000a      the devolved Scottish\u000d\u000a      Parliament.\" Keating also helped organise the RSE's `Franco-Scottish\u000d\u000a      Policy Seminar' (02\/10\/12)\u000d\u000a      on policy innovation, youth employment and training polices.\u000d\u000a    As a member of the British Academy (BA), Keating also serves on steering\u000d\u000a      committee for the joint\u000d\u000a      BA\/RSE initiative on Enlightening the Constitutional Debate. This involves\u000d\u000a      a series of monthly\u000d\u000a      seminars in 2013-14, with summary findings on the academies' web sites;\u000d\u000a      Keating organized the\u000d\u000a      seminar on Europe held in April 2013. Taken together, these efforts have\u000d\u000a      facilitated the\u000d\u000a      emergence of a permanent network of academics and policy practitioners who\u000d\u000a      know each other\u000d\u000a      and exchange ideas in a variety of forums. This network plays an\u000d\u000a      increasingly important role in\u000d\u000a      informing the public debate regarding the future of devolved government in\u000d\u000a      general, and the issue\u000d\u000a      of Scottish independence in particular. Keating's ESRC Large Grant funding\u000d\u000a      under the UK and\u000d\u000a      Scotland Programme will ensure this effort continues at least until the\u000d\u000a      referendum itself in 2014.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Michael Keating has worked on various aspects of public\u000d\u000a      policy-making in Scotland and\u000d\u000a      abroad, supported primarily by the ESRC and Leverhulme Trust. Impact has\u000d\u000a      taken the form of a\u000d\u000a      series of collaborative academic-practitioner engagements, involving civil\u000d\u000a      servants, politicians, and\u000d\u000a      civil society actors. These events have focused on establishing a common\u000d\u000a      vocabulary and core\u000d\u000a      concepts, while exploring difficult issues in public policy and\u000d\u000a      facilitating mutual learning between\u000d\u000a      academics and practitioners.

Rose led the Centre for the Study of Public Policy at\u000d\u000a      Aberdeen for much of the past\u000d\u000a      decade, producing several key works on policy learning (reference #1),\u000d\u000a      while Keating's work on\u000d\u000a      'devolution' in the United Kingdom frames the issue as part of a wider\u000d\u000a      process of government\u000d\u000a      restructuring or spatial rescaling which is transforming the nation-state\u000d\u000a      across Europe and beyond.\u000d\u000a      Systems of policy-making and regulation, previously bounded by coterminous\u000d\u000a      state boundaries,\u000d\u000a      are migrating to supra-national, sub-state, and transnational levels. As\u000d\u000a      different policy fields are\u000d\u000a      regulated at different levels, the old social compromises and trade-offs\u000d\u000a      previously accommodated\u000d\u000a      within the nation-state may become more difficult. Keating's research\u000d\u000a      addresses this dilemma by\u000d\u000a      analysing processes of policy-making, policy innovation, and policy\u000d\u000a      learning\/transfer in terms of\u000d\u000a      devolved or regional politics in contemporary democracies. In the Scottish\u000d\u000a      context, Keating's\u000d\u000a      research on public policy-making under devolution was conducted with\u000d\u000a      funding under the ESRC\u000d\u000a      programme on Devolution and Constitutional Change, the Leverhulme\u000d\u000a      programme on Nations and\u000d\u000a      Regions, and an ESRC Professorial Fellowship.\u000d\u000a    The first ESRC project (2001-04; &#163;120,000) examined policy-making after\u000d\u000a      devolution, charting the\u000d\u000a      adaptation from the Scottish Office to the Scottish Executive, financial\u000d\u000a      allocations, and policy\u000d\u000a      making in rural development and higher education. The data included\u000d\u000a      interviews carried out in\u000d\u000a      Scotland, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland with representatives of\u000d\u000a      interest groups, civil\u000d\u000a      servants and politicians; a detailed analysis of Scottish and English\u000d\u000a      spending patterns; and an\u000d\u000a      examination of legislative outputs and surveys to assess public opinion on\u000d\u000a      key issues. Among the\u000d\u000a      key findings was the insight that Scottish and Welsh policy-making became\u000d\u000a      more consultative and\u000d\u000a      transparent after devolution. In addition, the Scottish\/Welsh approach is\u000d\u000a      more consensual and\u000d\u000a      negotiated than policy-making in Whitehall and gives more scope for public\u000d\u000a      sector professionals\u000d\u000a      and interest groups. Key findings were published in Keating's book The\u000d\u000a      Government of Scotland\u000d\u000a      (reference #2), which examined institutions and processes of public policy\u000d\u000a      and substantive policies\u000d\u000a      in several key fields. The book demonstrated that Scotland has developed a\u000d\u000a      distinct policy style\u000d\u000a      and that its substantive policies are increasingly divergent from the rest\u000d\u000a      of the UK, particularly in\u000d\u000a      public service delivery. It also noted that while the administrative\u000d\u000a      performance of devolved\u000d\u000a      institutions was admirable, there had been a distinct lack of policy\u000d\u000a      innovation.\u000d\u000a    The Leverhulme grant noted above (2000-05; Aberdeen's portion: &#163;80,000)\u000d\u000a      funded a study of how\u000d\u000a      interest groups adapt to devolution and the emergence of territorial\u000d\u000a      policy communities in the four\u000d\u000a      nations of the UK. Keating and Cairney proposed the concept of\u000d\u000a      `territorial policy communities' to\u000d\u000a      designate territorially bounded constellations of actors within and across\u000d\u000a      policy sectors, emerging\u000d\u000a      in response to the rescaling of government. Using the UK's four distinct\u000d\u000a      models of devolution\u000d\u000a      (Scotland, Wales, North East England, and Northern Ireland) and\u000d\u000a      information from 300 interviews\u000d\u000a      conducted with interest group representatives, the researchers tested the\u000d\u000a      effects of stronger and\u000d\u000a      weaker forms of devolution on the territorialization of interest groups.\u000d\u000a      The project found that\u000d\u000a      devolution had indeed resulted in a territorialization of policy\u000d\u000a      communities and the creation of new\u000d\u000a      forms of horizontal co-operation and competition. During Cairney's time at\u000d\u000a      Aberdeen, he was a\u000d\u000a      research fellow on the ESRC and Leverhulme projects noted above, and he\u000d\u000a      and Keating received\u000d\u000a      funding from the Nuffield Foundation (2006-07) &#163;5122) to complete work on\u000d\u000a      policy styles and\u000d\u000a      policy communities, particularly in the UK context (references #3, #4, and\u000d\u000a      #5).\u000d\u000a    In 2009, Keating received an ESRC Follow-On grant (&#163;21,000) linked to the\u000d\u000a      original ESRC project.\u000d\u000a      This grant allowed him to engage with policy makers in Scotland, focusing\u000d\u000a      on how to promote\u000d\u000a      policy innovation (reference #6). Methods included the construction of an\u000d\u000a      internet portal to provide\u000d\u000a      information on research in public policy in Scotland and two joint\u000d\u000a      academic-practitioner seminars\u000d\u000a      that examined comparative experience of policy innovation and learning in\u000d\u000a      multi-level systems.\u000d\u000a      Outcomes included the development of teaching materials for\u000d\u000a      post-experience courses in policy-making.\u000d\u000a    Finally, between 2010 and 2013 Keating held an ESRC professorial\u000d\u000a      fellowship (&#163;361,828) to\u000d\u000a      research devolution, territorial policy communities, and policy making\u000d\u000a      across five European states.\u000d\u000a      In 2013, Keating was awarded a one-year ESRC senior fellowship (&#163;194,477)\u000d\u000a      under the UK and\u000d\u000a      Scotland Programme. This project is intended to improve the evidence base\u000d\u000a      for the Scottish\u000d\u000a      referendum of 2013 and examines the experience of small independent and\u000d\u000a      devolved jurisdictions\u000d\u000a      comparable to Scotland. Also in 2013, an interdisciplinary team from five\u000d\u000a      institutions won a Large\u000d\u000a      Grant from ESRC under the UK and Scotland Programme (Aberdeen's portion:\u000d\u000a      &#163;300,000), whose\u000d\u000a      aim is to improve the evidence base for the referendum for the benefit for\u000d\u000a      policy makers,\u000d\u000a      stakeholders and citizens. There is a programme for dissemination of\u000d\u000a      through seminars, web-based\u000d\u000a      publications, social media, and briefings for policy-makers.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43382","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    King's report recommended a number of ways in which the BBC's performance\u000a      could be improved,\u000a      including more thorough monitoring of the network's output, a system of\u000a      individual rewards and\u000a      penalties for succeeding or failing to report adequately and accurately\u000a      `the new UK', improved UK-related\u000a\u0009  training and career management, enhanced networking within the\u000a      BBC, and putting in\u000a      place one or more `enforcers' (see Ch. 9) [corroborating source 1].\u000a      However, much of the report\u000a      focused on consciousness-raising and the need to change the BBC's\u000a      corporate mind-set.\u000a    In welcoming King's report, the BBC Trust said it was \"concerned at\u000a      Professor King's assessment\u000a      that the BBC is not reporting the changing UK with the range that might be\u000a      expected\" and that it\u000a      was also \"concerned at the finding by Professor King that there is\u000a      insufficient precision and clarity\u000a      in the BBC's network coverage\" (p. 7) [corroborating source 1]. The Trust\u000a      charged BBC\u000a      management with first producing a plan for improving the BBC's performance\u000a      and then with\u000a      actually improving it. The Action Plan, published in July 2008, made\u000a      explicit efforts not only to\u000a      change the content of its broadcasting, but sought to change its\u000a      practices: \"In line with the\u000a      suggestion by Professor King's report, a senior individual will be given\u000a      the task of driving through\u000a      the day-to-day implementation of the action plan, reporting to the\u000a      Director of News. We will appoint\u000a      a `devolution champion' to fulfil this role\" (p. 2) [corroborating source\u000a      2].\u000a    In September 2009 the BBC Trust published a progress report on its\u000a      response to King's findings.\u000a      This report further demonstrates the operational changes that King\u000a      inspired in the BBC, including\u000a      senior editors attending workshops on matters relating to devolution, the\u000a      creation of an online\u000a      module on Reporting the UK by The College of Journalism, and senior\u000a      network editors improving\u000a      their understanding of devolution by taking part in a programme of\u000a      placements around the UK. In\u000a      addition to this, the progress report also highlighted the ways in which\u000a      the BBC was improving the\u000a      accuracy and diversity of its news coverage of the UK as a whole [3].\u000a    Since 2008 the Trust has monitored at intervals the extent to which BBC\u000a      News and Current Affairs\u000a      has improved its performance in this regard. Its verdict, while not\u000a      unqualified, has been positive. At\u000a      the time Professor King was appointed, in 2007, the Trust commissioned\u000a      detailed content-analysis\u000a      research from Cardiff University &#8212; the findings of which had pinpointed\u000a      serious failings in the\u000a      content and accuracy of the BBC's coverage [4]. The Trust commissioned\u000a      similar research from\u000a      the same source in late 2009 (published in March 2010) and that research\u000a      reported substantial\u000a      improvements in almost every regard [5]. The most dramatic increase was in\u000a      the number of explicit\u000a      or implicit references made to devolved powers, which increased from 71 to\u000a      480 across the BBC,\u000a      meaning every one in eight news items carried a reference to devolved\u000a      powers, as opposed to the\u000a      previous figure of one in fifty. Other findings showed an increased\u000a      awareness of devolution,\u000a      including a rise from 7.8% to 14.2% in news items on BBC TV about\u000a      Scotland, Wales, or Northern\u000a      Ireland. Coverage of matters explicitly to do with devolution also\u000a      increased across all BBC\u000a      platforms, most notably online (from 1.7% of news items to 3.5%) and also\u000a      on TV (0.7% to 1.2%)\u000a      (see pp. 4-6) [5]. Responding to the Cardiff group's findings, the BBC\u000a      Executive said it welcomed\u000a      \"the recognition in the new study of the work done since the King report\u000a      to improve the BBC's\u000a      journalism\", adding that it recognised \"that the momentum needs to be kept\u000a      up\" (p. 6) [6].\u000a    The figures from the Cardiff study demonstrate that King's report had a\u000a      significant effect on news\u000a      coverage of the devolved nations on the BBC. However, a critic may suggest\u000a      that this could have\u000a      been due to there being more relevant issues to cover or that the BBC is\u000a      simply catching up with\u000a      other broadcasters. This is shown not to be the case, as the Cardiff\u000a      findings compare the BBC's\u000a      TV coverage to that of Sky, ITV, and Channel Four. For instance, whereas\u000a      BBC TV increased its\u000a      coverage about devolved issues from 0.7% to 1.2% of news items, for the\u000a      other broadcasters\u000a      taken as a whole the figure fell from 0.6% to 0.3%. While a reference to\u000a      devolved powers was\u000a      found in one in every eight BBC news items, this figure was only one in\u000a      thirty for other\u000a      broadcasters &#8212; admittedly an improvement from these broadcasters' 2007\u000a      figure of one in ninety\u000a      (see pp. 4-6) [5].\u000a    Further evidence of the specific effect of King's report comes from\u000a      senior figures at the BBC who\u000a      have informed King of the impact of his work. For instance, BBC Scotland's\u000a      Political Editor, in an\u000a      email to King on an unrelated matter in October 2008, remarked, \"En\u000a      passant, I should say that\u000a      your report continues to cause a substantial (and I mean substantial)\u000a      reaction in the Beeb. I think\u000a      it's bringing about real change\" [7]. More recently, the Chairman of the\u000a      BBC Trust went out of his\u000a      way to tell King how important his report had been and how much impact it\u000a      had had. Indeed, a\u000a      number of senior figures at the BBC have agreed to corroborate the claims\u000a      made in this case\u000a      study.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Essex research on the causes and consequences of devolution substantially\u000a      changed the way\u000a      BBC News and Current Affairs reports on the nations of the United Kingdom.\u000a      Professor Anthony\u000a      King's research on devolution underpinned a 2008 report that he was\u000a      commissioned to prepare for\u000a      the BBC Trust.

Research for the book\u000a      involved&#8212;in addition to\u000a      extensive reading in government documents, parliamentary debates,\u000a      newspapers and the\u000a      secondary literature&#8212;conversations and interviews with political\u000a      practitioners and journalists.\u000a    Among King's principal conclusions were: (i) that the current\u000a      constitutional `settlement' was in fact\u000a      inherently unsettled; (ii) that the four nations' party and governmental\u000a      systems were likely to\u000a      diverge increasingly; (iii) that the four were also increasingly likely to\u000a      go their own way in policy\u000a      terms; (iv) that political communications within each of the four nations\u000a      were also increasingly likely\u000a      to diverge; and (v) that, for all those reasons, mutual ignorance across\u000a      the four nations was likely\u000a      to increase. In short, not only were Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\u000a      now devolved from\u000a      England, but England was devolved from them &#8212; without most English people\u000a      seeming to realise it.\u000a    Aware of King's work on the constitution, the BBC Trust commissioned him\u000a      in the autumn of 2007\u000a      to prepare a report on the adequacy or inadequacy of BBC News and Current\u000a      Affairs' coverage of\u000a      the devolved nations. The BBC Trust, in appointing King to write his\u000a      report, made specific public\u000a      reference in their press release (19.11.2007) to his book on the\u000a      constitution, and King drew heavily\u000a      on the research he had conducted for that book in carrying out his\u000a      additional research for the BBC\u000a      Trust. Among other things, it enabled him to conduct well-informed\u000a      interviews with senior figures in\u000a      Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast as well as in London. His report, published\u000a      in June 2008, reflects at\u000a      almost every point the author's knowledge of the devolved institutions and\u000a      their political\u000a      ramifications derived from his research for The British Constitution.\u000a    Much of Chapter 1 of his report, for example, is devoted to spelling out\u000a      how devolution has resulted\u000a      not merely in institutional change but in rapidly diverging party systems\u000a      and patterns of social\u000a      policy. It predicted that devolution, seen as a process rather than an\u000a      outcome, would lead both to\u000a      greater divergence and to Scotland and Wales, in particular, acquiring\u000a      greater devolved powers.\u000a      Almost every substantive chapter of his report contains explicit\u000a      comparisons between the facts of\u000a      devolution and the way in which those facts were reflected&#8212;or very\u000a      commonly not reflected&#8212;in\u000a      the BBC network's coverage; for example, the bogusness, not adequately\u000a      reflected in the BBC's\u000a      coverage, of Gordon Brown's 2007 pledge to train `British workers for\u000a      British jobs' when education\u000a      and training are matters wholly devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern\u000a      Ireland (King, 2008, p.\u000a      38), and the BBC network's frequent failure to make it clear, when\u000a      reporting matters relating to the\u000a      police and the criminal justice system, that these are matters strictly\u000a      for the Scottish Executive\u000a      north of the border (see King, 2008, p. 41).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43392","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The BES, whilst at Essex, has had impact in five main contexts:\u000a      pioneering online survey methods;\u000a      informing public opinion on AV; enabling the formation of a commercial\u000a      spin-out; informing UK\u000a      parliamentary debate; and shaping other countries' election studies.\u000a    In demonstrating the validity of internet polling in the UK the BES\u000a        helped alter the way\u000a        survey organisations sample public opinion\u000a      The BES's pioneering of online surveys was not simply a breakthrough in\u000a      survey methodology but\u000a      it helped to change how public opinion is sampled. YouGov initially used\u000a      online methods in\u000a      teaming up with the BES in analysing the 2001 General Election. In March\u000a      2013 the President of\u000a      YouGov confirmed that the success of this meant that YouGov was emboldened\u000a      to expand its\u000a      operations dramatically in an online direction, with increasing use of\u000a      online surveys in subsequent\u000a      elections. He also states that the BES's research convinced the survey\u000a      sector as a whole of the\u000a      validity of internet-based surveys and that \"the effects of this research\u000a      have been enormously\u000a      valuable in the last five years, with the continued growth of online\u000a      polling\" [corroborating source 1].\u000a      Further to this, YouGov's Special Projects Director notes in a journal\u000a      article that the \"expansion of\u000a      the online survey sector has changed the nature of public opinion research\u000a      in ways that have\u000a      important implications for scientific inquiry...

Extensive statistical\u000a      analysis of these results\u000a      enabled the team to provide a definitive picture, published in December\u000a      2010, of how AV would\u000a      have affected the outcome of the 2010 general election. The result would\u000a      have been only\u000a      marginally different from the actual First-Past-the-Post result but,\u000a      crucially, the Liberal Democrats\u000a      would have been in a position to form a majority government with either\u000a      Labour or the\u000a      Conservatives.\u000a    This finding from the BES was picked up by The Guardian and,\u000a      along with quotations from an\u000a      interview with Sanders, was used to demonstrate the difference to the\u000a      post-election landscape that\u000a      AV would have made [3]. More significantly, this finding from the BES was\u000a      used by both sides\u000a      campaigning in the AV referendum. The `No' campaign used the BES order to\u000a      support their claim\u000a      that the introduction of AV would serve mainly to strengthen the\u000a      `king-making' role of the Liberal\u000a      Democrats in government formation. The No2AV campaign used this argument\u000a      in its leaflets\u000a      without crediting the BES, but the BES was cited by various Labour\u000a      websites campaigning for a\u000a      `No' vote [4]. However, the LabourYes campaign cited the BES in its claim\u000a      that Conservative\u000a      opposition to AV was based simply on self-interest as the party would have\u000a      lost seats in recent\u000a      general elections [5].\u000a    The BES led directly to the formation of a profitable, commercial\u000a        spin-out, BPIX\u000a      The Essex BES team created a commercial spin-out, the British Polling\u000a      Index (BPIX), in 2007 with\u000a      the express aim of raising funds to support BES election surveys. BPIX\u000a      offers a survey-commissioning\u000a      service to major national newspapers and media outlets, involving the\u000a      design of\u000a      questionnaires and sampling frames. It has had a series of contracts with\u000a      the Daily Mail and the\u000a      Mail on Sunday. The polls that it conducts are typically included in\u000a      measures of the UK `poll-of-polls',\u000a      for example as reported by the UK Polling Report during the 2010 general\u000a      election\u000a      campaign. Since 2009, BPIX has raised over &#163;60,000 in profits that have\u000a      been ploughed back into\u000a      purchasing more and better BES surveys [6].\u000a    The BES has informed UK parliamentary debates\u000a      The BES is not simply used by analysts and the media, but is also a tool\u000a      used by politicians to\u000a      better understand politics. The BES has been cited in parliamentary\u000a      debates and been used as\u000a      evidence in informing the decisions of politicians\/political parties. For\u000a      instance, Paul Whiteley\u000a      worked as a Specialist Advisor to the Speaker's Conference on\u000a      Parliamentary Representation, the\u000a      report of which was published in 2010. The report cites BES findings on\u000a      the strength of party\u000a      identification in Britain (p. 32), but more significantly it cites\u000a      findings from the BES's survey from\u000a      May 2009 about the lack of public trust in politicians and parties (which\u000a      had originally been cited in\u000a      the Summary and Recommendations of the Conference's interim report) [7].\u000a      On the first sitting day\u000a      of 2012, there was a long (over 140 minutes) parliamentary debate on\u000a      diversity, growing out of and\u000a      frequently referring back to that Speaker's Conference report. There was\u000a      much discussion of the\u000a      measures that various parties had taken to address those concerns since\u000a      that report, and a\u000a      resolution was passed encouraging them to do more [8].\u000a    The BES has also informed parliamentary debates about the funding of\u000a      political parties. In its 2006\u000a      report on party funding, the House of Commons Constitutional Affairs\u000a      Committee drew on findings\u000a      from the BES. Those debates culminated in a set of recommendations from\u000a      the Committee on\u000a      Standards in Public Life, which were presented to Parliament in 2011. This\u000a      2011 report includes a\u000a      note of dissent from Oliver Heald, the Conservative Party representative\u000a      on the committee, which\u000a      cites the BES's findings on the political affiliations of trade union\u000a      members [9]. Heald ultimately\u000a      refused to sign the report.\u000a    The BES shapes the way other countries sample the opinion of their\u000a        citizens\u000a      Knowing what citizens think, and why, is central to democratic governance.\u000a      National election\u000a      studies are the premier scientific instrument through which democracies\u000a      explore what lies behind\u000a      the brute fact of the vote. National research councils generously fund\u000a      such studies, as a matter of\u000a      high national importance. The BES at Essex is widely regarded as a\u000a      template for other national\u000a      election studies, and the BES team is regularly asked to advise on the\u000a      design of national election\u000a      studies elsewhere in Europe. A Co-Principal Investigator on the Italian\u000a      study has confirmed that\u000a      \"the design innovations introduced in the 2001, 2005 and 2010 British\u000a      Election Studies had [a] very\u000a      significant effect on the design of the Italian National Election Study\u000a      from 2006 onwards\" [10]. He\u000a      goes on to say that \"the studies have employed internet components in the\u000a      overall design,\u000a      particularly for rolling campaign panel surveys, which interlock with\u000a      face-to-face surveys in the\u000a      manner pioneered by the BES at Essex\" [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research conducted at Essex as part of the British Election Study (BES)\u000a      successfully\u000a      demonstrated the validity of internet-polling methods.

Many important substantive themes and\u000a      findings have\u000a      emerged from this research, concerning (among many other things):\u000a    \u000a      The role of policy performance, particularly in relation to the\u000a        economy in driving electoral\u000a        support;\u000a      The decline of a sense of attachment to political parties in the minds\u000a        of the electorate;\u000a      A weakening of the sense of duty to participate, particularly among\u000a        young people, which has\u000a        produced a long-term decline in turnout;\u000a      The likely consequences of introducing AV in UK parliamentary\u000a        elections.\u000a    \u000a    Many of those specific findings are picked up in public discourse and\u000a      inform policy deliberations at\u000a      the highest levels, in ways discussed in Section 4 below.\u000a    The BES is not only a national resource for exploring and explaining\u000a      public opinion on the major\u000a      issues before the electorate, but is also a means for pioneering\u000a      methodological developments that\u000a      have subsequently become accepted and widely used. For instance, in the\u000a      early 2000s it was an\u000a      open question whether online surveys could reliably substitute for\u000a      traditional survey methods. The\u000a      matter was the subject of a testy 2004 exchange in the pages of the International\u000a        Journal of Market\u000a        Research, with an editorial describing what was at stake:\u000a    \"There is no issue more topical or more important in market research at\u000a      the moment than\u000a      internet surveys.... To put it somewhat crudely, if surveys via the\u000a      internet can prove their worth,\u000a      and given the increasing cost and difficulty of data collection both\u000a      face-to-face and by\u000a      telephone, the entire market research industry may be facing the biggest\u000a      shake-up it has seen\u000a      in decades\" Warren, M.

International Journal of\u000a        Market Research 46 (1): 1-2, at\u000a      p1.\u000a    A methodological breakthrough of signal importance lay in establishing\u000a      once and for all, through\u000a      careful analysis of the 2001 and 2005 BES data, that internet-based\u000a      surveys could be as reliable\u000a      as in-person interviews (Sanders et al. 2004; 2007; Clarke et al. 2008).\u000a      The key finding was\u000a      reported succinctly as follows:\u000a    \"We have conducted extensive statistical tests comparing the properties\u000a      of the internet panel\u000a      data and the in-person probability sample. Results of these tests (Sanders\u000a      et al. 2007)\u000a      demonstrate that the Internet and in-person data have very similar\u000a      distributions on key\u000a      variables and yield virtually identical parameter estimates for a wide\u000a      range of comparable\u000a      models of party choice and turnout\" (Clarke et al. 2009, p. 21).\u000a    As demonstrated in Section 4, below, the BES was instrumental in first\u000a      establishing, and then\u000a      expanding, the use of the online survey as a tool for sampling public\u000a      opinion.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43401","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"},{"GeoNamesId":"2088628","Name":"Papua New Guinea"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"718075","Name":"Macedonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"272103","Name":"Lebanon"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Birch's work on electoral malpractice has had documented impacts in\u000a      various geopolitical contexts, including the UK, Macedonia,\u000a        Mozambique, and Lebanon. In addition, Birch's work regularly informs\u000a      the work of various international organisations involved in the\u000a      organisation and monitoring of elections.\u000a    Impact in the UK\u000a    The Select Committee Inquiry into Postal Voting incorporated findings\u000a      from Birch and Watt's (2004) paper, including the analysis of the threat\u000a      of close personal influences on vote choice, into its report. The report\u000a      explicitly cited Birch and Watt's argument about the loss of secrecy\u000a      leading to the possibility of a market for votes developing [corroborating\u000a      source 1]. The Government accepted the findings of the report and this led\u000a      to the drawing up of a White Paper and a change in the law in 2006 on\u000a      postal voting. Part 14 of The Electoral Administration Act 2006, which\u000a      came into force in 2007, included the introduction of stricter measures to\u000a      prevent the abuse of postal vote fraud through the requirement, among\u000a      other things, of individual voter signature and signature verification for\u000a      postal voters, and this has led to a reduction in the abuse of postal\u000a      voting since its introduction.\u000a    The major impact in the UK of Birch's research has been its contribution\u000a      to the reduction of postal-voting fraud. This was most evident in the 2010\u000a      General Election &#8212; the first opportunity for the new measures to be in\u000a      force at a national election. There is clear evidence that postal vote\u000a      fraud decreased considerably after the introduction in 2007 of the new\u000a      laws that Birch and Watt's research helped to inform. First, the Electoral\u000a      Commission itself is convinced that the measures of the 2006 Act improved\u000a      electoral integrity and provided a deterrent to fraud. Analyses of\u000a      elections held in 2008, 2009 and 2010 confirmed that since the passage of\u000a      the Electoral Administration Act 2006 there has been no repeat of postal\u000a      vote abuse on the scale encountered prior to that time [corroborating\u000a      source 2]. Second, official statistics from the 2010 General Election show\u000a      that the absolute number of ballots rejected under the new system was\u000a      220,000 or 3.8% of the total postal votes cast [3]. This compares with\u000a      2.5% of postal votes that were rejected in the 2005 General Election.\u000a      Whilst the number of ballots rejected is undeniably far larger than the\u000a      number of voters seeking to commit fraud, the reduction in ballot fraud\u000a      between 2005 and 2010 demonstrates that more stringent checks were being\u000a      made and postal voting was held up to greater scrutiny in the 2010\u000a      election. A useful by-product of these changes was the considerable\u000a      increase in voter confidence in electoral integrity. In 2005 research\u000a      found that 46% of the population believed postal voting to be unsafe; by\u000a      2011, this figure had dropped to 20% [4].\u000a    Impact in Macedonia\u000a    The most significant direct impact of Birch's research on the threat of\u000a      family members to ballot secrecy has been on policymaking and electoral\u000a      administrative practice in Macedonia. In its report on the 2006\u000a      parliamentary elections, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in\u000a      Europe (OSCE) reported that the practices of illegal proxy, family and\u000a      group voting were \"widespread\". Birch's work helped to reduce family\u000a      voting in the 2011 Macedonian parliamentary elections.\u000a    In March and April 2007, Birch served as a consultant on a United Nations\u000a      Development Programme project entitled `One Voter &#8212; One Ballot: Addressing\u000a      Proxy and Family Voting in Macedonia'. She was engaged in this project at\u000a      the initial stages, and her role (as part of a three-person team of\u000a      experts) was to use her research expertise to help design a strategy for\u000a      reducing illegal proxy and family voting to be implemented as part of the\u000a      three-year UNDP project. This involved specifying the types of family\u000a      members who were most likely to be vulnerable and those who were most\u000a      likely to be culpable of abuse, clarified the nature of the problem, and\u000a      helped to identify this problem as a serious breach of international human\u000a      rights commitments.\u000a    The project in turn funded a number of civil society initiatives and\u000a      training programmes for electoral administrators. It also fed directly\u000a      into the State Election Commission of Macedonia's `Strategy Against Family\u000a      and Proxy Voting of the State Election Commission', published in 2010,\u000a      which mentions the influence of the UNDP project explicitly on three\u000a      occasions (pp. 7, 11, unnumbered Annex), demonstrating that the project\u000a      played a central role in the development of this policy instrument [5].\u000a      The project was also influential in drawing attention to the problem of\u000a      proxy voting, such that efforts to eliminate it figured prominently in the\u000a      National Democratic Institute-sponsored Code of Conduct signed by\u000a      political parties in advance of the 2011 elections held on 5 June 2011\u000a      [6].\u000a    The report and the associated strategy had, in turn, a direct impact on\u000a      the practice of family voting in the Balkan republic. The OSCE's official\u000a      report documented that the practice declined 17% in subsequent\u000a      parliamentary elections in June 2011 [7].\u000a    Impact in Lebanon and Mozambique\u000a    Birch was engaged in a series of training projects on parliamentary\u000a      strengthening in which her work on electoral malpractice and democracy in\u000a      general formed much of the substantive content. The projects were part of\u000a      a larger &#163;5 million programme on parliamentary strengthening and democracy\u000a      funded by the Department for International Development (DFID) and\u000a      delivered by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy between 2008 and\u000a      2013. Birch delivered her training in Lebanon (itself governed by a\u000a      complicated and confessional system of representation across its many\u000a      religious groupings) and Mozambique, a country which features in her Index\u000a      of Electoral Malpractice dataset and which she addresses in Electoral\u000a        Malpractice (2011).\u000a    The aim of the programme was to assist parliamentary staff in\u000a      understanding the role of parliament in modern democracy, how elections\u000a      convert votes to seats, and how the population of a parliament as well as\u000a      its dispatch of legislative functions must be based on free and fair\u000a      electoral procedures. The final report for the programme submitted in late\u000a      summer 2013 claims that \"One of the major achievements of the global TWC\u000a      programme is the establishment of Parliamentary Study Centres (PSCs) in\u000a      Uganda, Mozambique and a regional Arab Institute for Parliamentary\u000a      Training and Legislative Studies (AIPTLS) in Lebanon\" [8]. Birch's work\u000a      contributed to the development of the centre in Lebanon, while she was\u000a      able to share her insights about electoral malpractice in Mozambique with\u000a      the Parliamentary Studies Centre in the parliament building in Maputo.\u000a    Contributing to the work of international organisations\u000a    In October 2012 Birch gave a presentation to the European Parliament's\u000a      Directorate-General for External Policies of the Union workshop on `The\u000a      situation in Ukraine ahead of the 2012 parliamentary elections and the\u000a      preparation for these elections'. The presentation drew heavily on her\u000a      research, most notably a case study on the country in Electoral\u000a        Malpractice (2011), and addressed both the background to the\u000a      electoral system and the contemporary issues in Ukraine. Her presentation\u000a      focused largely on the problems of malpractice and the measures taken to\u000a      ensure free and fair elections [9].\u000a    Birch's work is cited regularly in the publications and presentations of\u000a      major international organisations. For instance, a 2011 Overseas\u000a      Development Institute paper on electoral systems relies heavily on Birch's\u000a      work in its analysis of electoral malpractice, especially her dataset on\u000a      new and semi-democracies [10]. In addition, a July 2012 presentation from\u000a      Andrew Ellis, Director for Asia and the Pacific at the International\u000a      Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, drew on Birch's\u000a      research. This presentation expounds what Ellis terms \"the Birch\u000a      methodology\" and addresses how Birch's categorisation of malpractice can\u000a      be applied. He cites how Birch's Index of Electoral Malpractice has been\u000a      used by the Papua New Guinea Election Study to code the reports of\u000a      domestic electoral observers [11].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Essex research on electoral administration has informed the development\u000a      of practical measures to reduce electoral corruption in a number of\u000a      different countries. Work led by Professor Sarah Birch has contributed\u000a      significantly to promoting good practice in elections both in the UK and\u000a      in a number of new and semi-democracies. In the UK, Birch's research\u000a      played an important role in shaping the Electoral Administration Act 2006,\u000a      which led to a significant reduction in postal voting abuse in the 2010\u000a      General Election. In Macedonia, Birch's research was used to inform a UN\u000a      Development Programme project on proxy voting that fed directly into\u000a      strategy documents from the State Election Commission and a Code of\u000a      Conduct signed by all parties. Following the project, 'family voting' in\u000a      Macedonia declined 17 per cent in the 2011 parliamentary elections.

Her research programme involved a constant interaction with\u000a      policymakers, with the early findings of her research informing the\u000a      policymaking process, both in the UK and internationally. These\u000a      interactions with policymakers, in turn, informed her major publications\u000a      in this field, most notably Electoral Malpractice (2011). The\u000a      corpus of work presented in Section 3 summarises the results of her\u000a      developing work over the period. It shows the ways in which electoral\u000a      corruption can occur in `advanced' as well as in new democracies and\u000a      recommends clear, practical strategies for countering such malpractices.\u000a    One of the main focuses of Birch's research on electoral malpractice has\u000a      been ballot secrecy, which is a key human right, enshrined in numerous\u000a      international legal instruments including the European Convention on Human\u000a      Rights (ECHR). Indeed, ballot secrecy and freedom from torture are the\u000a      only rights in the ECHR from which there can be no derogation. Protection\u000a      of this fundamental right is essential for ensuring a healthy democracy.\u000a      However, there have been cases where the right to ballot secrecy has been\u000a      seen to conflict with other values and aims. Birch's research has focused\u000a      on ways in which these concerns can be addressed while also maintaining\u000a      ballot secrecy, even within the confines of close relations such as the\u000a      family.\u000a    Birch's research on family voting identified the legal and normative\u000a      importance of the secret ballot, even within the domestic context. The\u000a      research showed that patriarchal power relations among family members in\u000a      some cultures can undermine ballot secrecy by pressuring female family\u000a      members to reveal their vote choice to male family members (typically\u000a      fathers) and\/or allow male family members to vote on their behalf. The\u000a      research explored the social and political dynamics of this problem:\u000a      female family members tend to prioritise their domestic roles over their\u000a      civic roles, so while they may be reluctant to allow male family members\u000a      to vote on their behalf, they may be in a position where, for\u000a      psychological, economic and cultural reasons, they cannot afford to\u000a      prioritise their civic duty to safeguard the secrecy of their vote. This\u000a      makes them vulnerable to abuses of ballot secrecy, which they may collude\u000a      in enabling. Family voting can occur both through postal voting where it\u000a      is conducted in the privacy of the home or, in some cases, in the polling\u000a      station where family members may enter the polling booth together.\u000a    Much of Birch's work has focused on elections and electoral\u000a      (mal)practices in the UK and in emerging democracies. In 2004 Birch\u000a      produced an article for Political Quarterly (co-written with an\u000a      Essex lawyer, Bob Watt) that considered family voting in the context of\u000a      remote electronic voting and postal voting. This paper highlighted the\u000a      potential problems with remote voting, including the loss of ballot\u000a      secrecy and the possibility of undue influence. Birch and Watt argued that\u000a      away from the secrecy of the polling station there was greater potential\u000a      for malpractice and that attempts to introduce widespread remote voting\u000a      methods in England should be brought before the courts. The paper was\u000a      submitted as written evidence to the House of Commons Office of the Deputy\u000a      Prime Minister: Housing, Local Government and the Regions Select Committee\u000a      Inquiry into Postal Voting. Birch remained in close contact with\u000a      policymakers and, as described below, the key recommendations of the paper\u000a      were incorporated into legislation in 2006.\u000a    Birch's work, however, has always been concerned to explore empirical\u000a      applications beyond the UK. Her work has been genuinely and extensively\u000a      comparative (Birch 2007, 2008, 2010). As part of a British Academy-funded\u000a      project, in 2007 Birch produced a dataset on electoral malpractice in new\u000a      and semi-democracies. This dataset, which has been regularly updated since\u000a      2007, was developed using an Index of Electoral Malpractice (IEM) that\u000a      involved the coding of election observation reports along 15 indices. This\u000a      quantitative method enables comparison between states and comparison\u000a      within a state over time. Following from her analysis of elections in a\u000a      large number of states, Birch has also produced a typology of electoral\u000a      malpractice (Birch, 2011). This typology is not only a useful academic\u000a      heuristic for understanding malpractice, but it also serves as a means of\u000a      categorising malpractice in the field and, crucially, of evaluating actual\u000a      cases of malpractice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43404","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2029969","Name":"Mongolia"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Landman's research insights have been employed in various international\u000a      contexts.

In September 2012 he\u000a      gave a keynote speech on the prospects for EU democracy promotion in the\u000a      Arab Spring countries at the Representation of Rhine-Westphalia in\u000a      Brussels, organised by the German Development Institute [5]. On these\u000a      occasions, Landman was delivering core commentary and analysis for leading\u000a      global and European policy makers: the UNDP event attracted 270 delegates\u000a      from around the world; the Arab Spring event attracted 130 delegates\u000a      working on issues relating to EU democracy promotion in Brussels. The UNDP\u000a      appearance led to further briefings in the New York office and a\u000a      commissioned study (&#163;25,000) on the relationship between democratic\u000a      governance and sustainable human development (2012- 2013) [6].\u000a    Providing resources and training for International IDEA\u000a    Landman's work on democracy attracted the attention of the International\u000a      Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), a 28-member\u000a      inter-governmental organisation based in Sweden. Between 2004 and 2009 he\u000a      worked on a variety of democracy assessment projects, which culminated in\u000a      the 2008 publication of Assessing the Quality of Democracy: A\u000a        Practical Guide (a significantly revised version of the original Handbook\u000a        of Democracy Assessment) and Assessing the Quality of Democracy:\u000a        An Overview of the International IDEA Framework [7]. These\u000a      documents, of which Landman was the lead author, are resources for\u000a      assessing the quality of democracy in any country and are used by teams\u000a      throughout the world [8]. The `State of Democracy' programme at\u000a      International IDEA is one of the main pillars of its activities and the\u000a      Landman's Practical Guide and Overview serve as the main\u000a      methods of application in the field. The Director of Global Programmes at\u000a      International IDEA has stated that this work \"continues to be a resource\u000a      for teams in different parts of the world who want to assess the quality\u000a      of their democracies\" [8]. International IDEA has now translated these\u000a      publications into Spanish, French, and Arabic (as well as a Thai version\u000a      of the Practical Guide, produced by one of International IDEA's\u000a      partners), and the most recent applications of them have been in Zambia,\u000a      Chile and Ukraine [8].\u000a    Landman has been commissioned to provide training for IDEA's 150 staff\u000a      for the period 2012-2014 (April and November annually) on issues relating\u000a      to the measurement and assessment of democratic performance, as well as to\u000a      provide an overview of the assessment framework.

As a result of this contribution, more and more\u000a      International IDEA regional programmes are prioritising democracy\u000a      assessment in their work... Given his deep knowledge and experience of\u000a      democracy assessment in general and the state of democracy assessment and\u000a      approach in particular, Dr Landman remains an important resource for many\u000a      assessment teams applying International IDEA's state of democracy\u000a      assessment framework. This has made him the main intellectual partner for\u000a      International IDEA's democracy assessment work'' [8].\u000a    Assessing the quality of democracy in Mongolia and Ukraine\u000a    Landman's most notable direct involvements in democracy assessment have\u000a      taken place in Mongolia and Ukraine. In Mongolia he assisted a local team\u000a      of academics to develop a series of democratic governance indicators. One\u000a      of the main outcomes of the assessment in Mongolia was the formal passage\u000a      of a 9th Millennium Development Goal on democracy, human rights\u000a      and zero tolerance of corruption in 2006. Mongolians now produce bi-annual\u000a      assessments using the framework developed with Landman's assistance and\u000a      input [9]. The 2009 `Millennium Development Goal-9 Indicators and the\u000a      State of Democracy in Mongolia' report makes direct reference to\u000a      assistance from the University of Essex and Landman's research [10].\u000a    In Ukraine, Landman is part of an international team of experts funded by\u000a      the Westminster Foundation for Democracy assisting People First!&#8212;a\u000a      Kiev-based NGO&#8212;to assess the quality of democracy in Ukraine and develop a\u000a      Citizen's Charter for Democracy. He participated in the first training\u000a      workshop in November 2012 and continues to be engaged in the project\u000a      throughout 2013 [11].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Essex research on developing quantitative indicators for assessing\u000a      countries' performance on human rights and democracy has informed the work\u000a      of a number of international organisations.

He has\u000a      subsequently held the positions of Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, Reader and\u000a      Professor of Government.\u000a    Landman's work initially concentrated on so-called `standards-based'\u000a      measures of democracy and human rights, but he soon developed an interest\u000a      in events-based and survey-based measures, as well as the use of\u000a      socio-economic and administrative statistics (the full statement of which\u000a      appears in Landman and Carvalho, 2009). His work shows that triangulating\u000a      sources of data on government performance with respect to democracy and\u000a      human rights is critical for sustaining empirical inferences and for\u000a      providing high-quality evidence-based policy inputs of the kind\u000a      increasingly demanded by inter-governmental and governmental agencies. His\u000a      human rights research developed an original way to code a country's treaty\u000a      ratification that takes into account both its ratification of the treaty\u000a      and the form of reservations it files at time of ratification. This coding\u000a      scheme more accurately reflects de jure country commitment to\u000a      human rights and has been used to analyse the relationship between the\u000a      international law of human rights and the actual protection of human\u000a      rights across the world (see Landman, 2005a).\u000a    Landman's subsequent research in the field of human rights has developed\u000a      a combined factor score of human rights protection that was published in International\u000a        Studies Quarterly (Landman and Larizza, 2009). He has researched\u000a      means of reflecting country-level human rights performance in ways\u000a      appropriate for empirical studies and policy inputs. This continued work\u000a      on refining human rights measurement features in his 2012 article in The\u000a        Journal of Human Rights, which `relativises' human rights\u000a      performance by taking into account underlying social, economic and\u000a      political conditions and ranking countries in absolute and relative\u000a      performance. He was awarded an ESRC grant for &#163;99,944 to construct a human\u000a      rights atlas, which was launched on 3 December 2012 and provides a\u000a      user-friendly web interface for visualising human rights and other country\u000a      performance data (see www.humanrightsatlas.org).\u000a      He is currently embarking on a project with Professor Tom Scotto at Essex\u000a      that combines survey data and experimental data on how human rights\u000a      problems are framed and perceived in an effort to enhance existing\u000a      measures of human rights performance.\u000a    Landman's research has been of interest to policy makers and\u000a      practitioners in the fields of development assistance, democracy support,\u000a      and the monitoring and implementation of human rights &#8212; as detailed in\u000a      Section 4.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43464","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"51537","Name":"Somalia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The significance of the PRDU's work is that it has shaped the UK\u000d\u000a      government's approach to\u000d\u000a      conflict assessment and resolution. In doing so, it has directly supported\u000d\u000a      the shift towards\u000d\u000a      integrated planning for conflict and security. The PRDU's research has had\u000d\u000a      significant impact on\u000d\u000a      the UK government's design and use of strategic conflict and stability\u000d\u000a      assessments in two stages:\u000d\u000a      i) via a DfID-commissioned strategic conflict assessment project on\u000d\u000a      Afghanistan; and ii) as a key\u000d\u000a      source for the creation of the Joint Assessment of Conflict and Security\u000d\u000a      methodology. These\u000d\u000a      research impacts build on a sustained period of engagement with DfID,\u000d\u000a      based on four\u000d\u000a      commissioned research projects since 2008 (at a total value of &#163;232,000),\u000d\u000a      plus a &#163;285,000 ESRC-DfID\u000d\u000a      project on `The Influence of DfID-sponsored state building-oriented\u000d\u000a      research on British policy\u000d\u000a      in fragile, post-conflict environments'. Joint assessment of conflict has\u000d\u000a      now been accepted by the\u000d\u000a      UK as the appropriate way to plan for conflict and stability. This is\u000d\u000a      demonstrated in the Cabinet\u000d\u000a      Office paper, `Guidance for an Integrated Approach to Conflict and\u000d\u000a      Stability', which states that\u000d\u000a      conflict analysis `should follow the JACS model' (Cabinet\u000d\u000a      Office\/Cross-Government Integrated\u000d\u000a      Approach Working Group 2012).\u000d\u000a    1) In 2008, DfID commissioned Barakat to lead a team of Afghanistan\u000d\u000a      experts on the\u000d\u000a      `Understanding Afghanistan' (UA) project. Barakat led on the strategic\u000d\u000a      conflict assessment (SCA)\u000d\u000a      of Afghanistan (Barakat et al. 2008), one of four pillars of the\u000d\u000a      project, for which PRDU was\u000d\u000a      awarded a &#163;111,127 DfID grant. This project drew on DfID's guidance notes\u000d\u000a      on strategic conflict\u000d\u000a      assessment (2002), the PRDU's `composite' approach and a `participatory\u000d\u000a      learning process',\u000d\u000a      engaging with a wide variety of actors in Afghanistan, including members\u000d\u000a      of the Taliban. The SCA\u000d\u000a      was influential in UK government policy and was later incorporated into\u000d\u000a      tailored Country\u000d\u000a      Programmes. According to DfID: `This [SCA] report has been utilised as\u000d\u000a      part of numerous reviews\u000d\u000a      of the British government's engagement in Afghanistan. It particularly fed\u000d\u000a      into the development of\u000d\u000a      the Country Programmes adopted by DfID...[and] was taken up by both the\u000d\u000a      FCO and Stabilisation\u000d\u000a      Unit in helping to inform their pursuit of diplomatic resolutions to the\u000d\u000a      conflict' (DfID letter, 2009).\u000d\u000a      Barakat and Zyck were subsequently invited to give evidence at the House\u000d\u000a      of Commons Foreign\u000d\u000a      Affairs Committee in October 2010 (p. 25) in which they made\u000d\u000a      recommendations for a diplomatic\u000d\u000a      resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan. This parliamentary evidence\u000d\u000a      (Barakat and Zyck 2010)\u000d\u000a      summarised the conclusions of the SCA and the UA programme as a whole:\u000d\u000a      that is, a political\u000d\u000a      solution was needed to resolve the conflict. All authors of the\u000d\u000a      `Understanding Afghanistan' project\u000d\u000a      endorsed the necessity of this approach, which contributed to it becoming\u000d\u000a      part of the mainstream\u000d\u000a      consensus.\u000d\u000a    2) The impact of the SCA report was further extended and widened through\u000d\u000a      the PRDU's work with\u000d\u000a      DfID in operationalising the JACS methodology, an evolution of the\u000d\u000a      existing strategic conflict\u000d\u000a      assessment approach. This methodology has been cited as a key component of\u000d\u000a      the UK\u000d\u000a      government's `Building Stability Overseas Strategy', jointly authored by\u000d\u000a      DfID, the Ministry of\u000d\u000a      Defence and FCO (2011, p.24), which states: \"We will introduce a new\u000d\u000a      cross-government strategic\u000d\u000a      conflict assessment... [to] bring together political, economic, social and\u000d\u000a      security analysis to provide\u000d\u000a      joint assessment of conflicts\". The key component of the overall strategy\u000d\u000a      is to seek to ensure that\u000d\u000a      the UK government: i) identifies early warnings of instability and\u000d\u000a      potential conflict; and ii) delivers a\u000d\u000a      rapid and effective response. The importance of this to the UK government\u000d\u000a      is underscored by the\u000d\u000a      funding commitment stated in the strategy, namely: `by 2014\/15 we will\u000d\u000a      have increased to 30% the\u000d\u000a      proportion of UK Official Development Assistance (ODA) that supports\u000d\u000a      fragile and conflict affected\u000d\u000a      states' (BSOS, p.13).\u000d\u000a    In 2011, Barakat and the PRDU began work on an ESRC-DfID funded project,\u000d\u000a      studying DfID's use\u000d\u000a      of its own sponsored research on policy in fragile, post-conflict states.\u000d\u000a      During the first year of the\u000d\u000a      project, Barakat and Waldman were invited by DfID to respond to a\u000d\u000a      consultation on the\u000d\u000a      development of a joint framework for conflict analysis, based on contacts\u000d\u000a      established via the\u000d\u000a      project. The initial findings of this were presented at a DfID workshop,\u000d\u000a      attended by officials from the\u000d\u000a      FCO and MOD. The feedback received at the workshop informed the final\u000d\u000a      report: `Revising the\u000d\u000a      SCA: Toward a Joint Framework for Conflict Analysis' (Barakat and Waldman\u000d\u000a      2011). The report\u000d\u000a      highlighted a series of significant issues for consideration, including\u000d\u000a      the importance of local\u000d\u000a      perspectives and of acknowledging that assessment can lose objectivity\u000d\u000a      when donors fail to\u000d\u000a      recognise their own role as protagonists in conflict affected states (see\u000d\u000a      research findings 3 &amp; 4). It\u000d\u000a      recommended three phases for JACS with detailed steps in each stage: i)\u000d\u000a      inception and initiation;\u000d\u000a      ii) analysis; and iii) utilisation. This phased approach is mirrored in\u000d\u000a      the DfID consultation paper,\u000d\u000a      `Joint Analysis of Conflict and Stability &#8212; Guidance Notes', reflecting\u000d\u000a      the influence of Barakat and\u000d\u000a      Waldman's research on the UK government's adoption of integrated conflict\u000d\u000a      analysis. As the DfID\u000d\u000a      consultation paper points out, the methodology outlined provides `an\u000d\u000a      overview of the UK's current\u000d\u000a      approach to the analysis of conflict and stability... [and] the basis for\u000d\u000a      shared analysis and\u000d\u000a      understanding among government departments working overseas'. In June\u000d\u000a      2013, the ESRC-DfID\u000d\u000a      project was selected (out of over 1100 projects) to be part of a pilot\u000d\u000a      exercise by the External\u000d\u000a      Champion for RCUK's Global Uncertainties Programme, whose role is to\u000d\u000a      support the delivery of\u000d\u000a      impact.\u000d\u000a    3) The impact of Barakat and the PRDU in conflict assessment has reached\u000d\u000a      beyond the UK with\u000d\u000a      the PRDU commissioned to undertake tailored conflict assessments for other\u000d\u000a      bilateral and\u000d\u000a      multilateral donor organisations, most notably, a &#163;487,391 project for\u000d\u000a      UNICEF in Somalia that\u000d\u000a      began in 2013. The UNICEF project builds on earlier commissioned projects\u000d\u000a      in which the PRDU\u000d\u000a      (working with the Institute for Effective Education, University of York)\u000d\u000a      evaluated the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      UNICEF's education in emergencies programme. The UNICEF `Peacebuilding,\u000d\u000a      Education and\u000d\u000a      Advocacy Programme' (PBEA), a four year $150m project launched in 2012 and\u000d\u000a      involving 14\u000d\u000a      conflict affected states, was informed by the PRDU's finding that conflict\u000d\u000a      assessment should be\u000d\u000a      carried out to inform the design of the education interventions. The\u000d\u000a      significance of the Somalia\u000d\u000a      project is that it adopts the approach set out in the PBEA in linking\u000d\u000a      up-to-date conflict assessment\u000d\u000a      with the design of education programmes. This project uses the PRDU's\u000d\u000a      pioneering use of a\u000d\u000a      reflexive `participatory learning process', which in this case involves\u000d\u000a      training and recruiting local\u000d\u000a      conflict assessors on the ground in Somalia. These processes have built\u000d\u000a      capacity in-country and\u000d\u000a      ensures that the assessment is continually evolving, which in turn informs\u000d\u000a      the education\u000d\u000a      programmes run by UNICEF.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research led by Professor Sultan Barakat of the Post-war Reconstruction\u000d\u000a      and Development Unit\u000d\u000a      (PRDU) has had substantial impact in the UK and internationally on the\u000d\u000a      design and use of strategic\u000d\u000a      conflict and stability assessments of war-affected and fragile states.

Since the early\u000d\u000a      1990s, the PRDU has\u000d\u000a      conducted pioneering research on conflict-affected and fragile states. The\u000d\u000a      major contribution of the\u000d\u000a      PRDU has been to produce a conceptual framework and diagnostic toolkit,\u000d\u000a      designed specifically\u000d\u000a      for conflict assessment and post-war reconstruction, which focuses on the\u000d\u000a      local context and history\u000d\u000a      of the conflict, the existing institutional arrangements and internal\u000d\u000a      structures of power.\u000d\u000a      Fundamentally, the research highlights the need for a joined-up approach\u000d\u000a      to dealing with stability\u000d\u000a      after conflict and in fragile states. This toolkit uses a\u000d\u000a      multidisciplinary approach and research\u000d\u000a      synergies between international relations, security studies, political\u000d\u000a      economy, international\u000d\u000a      development, humanitarian and area studies (Barakat and Ellis 1996;\u000d\u000a      Barakat 2003) to assess\u000d\u000a      conflict resolution. Since 2000, the PRDU's research has attracted nearly\u000d\u000a      &#163;2 million of external\u000d\u000a      research income from governments (e.g. UK and Afghanistan), multilateral\u000d\u000a      organisations (e.g.\u000d\u000a      World Bank and UNICEF), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) e.g.\u000d\u000a      Saferworld and other key\u000d\u000a      research funders, such as the ESRC.\u000d\u000a    Key findings of the research include:\u000d\u000a    1) The view that UK `joint assessment' of conflict and stability (i.e.\u000d\u000a      shared analysis by DfID, the\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Defence and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)) is both\u000d\u000a      necessary and\u000d\u000a      achievable (Barakat and Waldman 2013). Although the merits of integrated\u000d\u000a      forms of conflict\u000d\u000a      assessment have long been recognised in relevant policy-making circles,\u000d\u000a      Barakat and the PRDU\u000d\u000a      played a pivotal role in developing a holistic approach for putting these\u000d\u000a      ideas into practice. This\u000d\u000a      approach enabled PRDU researchers to identify deficiencies in early models\u000d\u000a      of joint assessment\u000d\u000a      (e.g. divergent bureaucratic cultures and department priorities, time and\u000d\u000a      resource pressures, the\u000d\u000a      absence of strategic coherence and policy consistency) and\u000d\u000a      practical measures for overcoming\u000d\u000a      them (e.g. agreeing to a shared, cross-department framework for conflict\u000d\u000a      assessment).\u000d\u000a    2) Establishing that an integrated conflict assessment rests on a\u000d\u000a      multidisciplinary methodological\u000d\u000a      approach and one which is sufficiently flexible to adapt to rapidly\u000d\u000a      changing conditions in the field\u000d\u000a      (Barakat 2003). This approach combines analyses of pre-existing\u000d\u000a      institutional arrangements,\u000d\u000a      conflict dynamics, political economy, past interventions and policy\u000d\u000a      recommendations, and the\u000d\u000a      cultural values of conflict-affected communities.\u000d\u000a    3) The importance of including local actors in the assessment. The PRDU's\u000d\u000a      research has shown\u000d\u000a      that successful conflict assessment must be a `participatory learning\u000d\u000a      process', which draws on\u000d\u000a      local institutions and capacities (Barakat and Ellis 1996; Barakat 2003;\u000d\u000a      Barakat and Zyck 2010).\u000d\u000a      Consequently, the assessment must include local actors contributing to the\u000d\u000a      process of conflict\u000d\u000a      resolution while learning from it. This approach, drawing principally on\u000d\u000a      intensive fieldwork\u000d\u000a      conducted in conflict-affected countries, ensures that all actors in\u000d\u000a      conflict zones are engaged as\u000d\u000a      active participants in the assessment. The key advantages of this approach\u000d\u000a      are two-fold: the\u000d\u000a      assessment produces a more rounded and accurate picture; and due to its\u000d\u000a      network of local actors\u000d\u000a      the assessment is accurate and up to date. This feature of the PRDU's\u000d\u000a      approach distinguishes it\u000d\u000a      from the traditional `desk-based' research typically undertaken by Western\u000d\u000a      consultants based\u000d\u000a      outside assessed countries.\u000d\u000a    4) Demonstrating that external donors need to recognise their presence\u000d\u000a      and role as protagonists in\u000d\u000a      the conflict-affected countries they analyse (Barakat and Waldman 2013;\u000d\u000a      Barakat and Zyck 2009).\u000d\u000a      This is a crucial point, since the effectiveness of assessment is often\u000d\u000a      compromised by the failure to\u000d\u000a      recognise the unintended effects of external intervention in\u000d\u000a      conflict-affected and fragile states.\u000d\u000a    The key researchers at the University of York involved in the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research are:\u000d\u000a      Professor Sultan Barakat, PRDU Director 1993- (Lecturer 1995-2001; Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer 2001-2005;\u000d\u000a      Professor 2005-)\u000d\u000a      Dr Thomas Waldman, PRDU Research Fellow (2011-)\u000d\u000a      Mr Steven A.

Second,\u000d\u000a      the guide advocates\u000d\u000a      that BI (among other policies) should be implemented within a progressive\u000d\u000a      system of public finance\u000d\u000a      and a reworked conceptualisation of the commons. The elaboration of this\u000d\u000a      idea (Council of Europe\u000d\u000a      2013, pp.133-154) is, again, based on Haagh's work with the concept of\u000d\u000a      `progressive public\u000d\u000a      finance' as delineated in Haagh (2012). According to the Head of the\u000d\u000a      Social Cohesion Research\u000d\u000a      and Early Warning Directorate at the CoE, Haagh's `ideas of progressive\u000d\u000a        public finance, basic\u000d\u000a        income as a source of property rights in stability, and education and\u000d\u000a        work as areas of the\u000d\u000a        commons, have been influential in shaping the debates and policy\u000d\u000a        discourse ...and in informing the\u000d\u000a        content of the Council's work and the guide'.\u000d\u000a    2) Haagh was commissioned by the National Council for Welfare (NCW), an\u000d\u000a      advisory group on\u000d\u000a      social development established by statute that reported directly to the\u000d\u000a      Canadian federal Minister for\u000d\u000a      Human Resources and Skills Development, to conduct a seminar on BI for its\u000d\u000a      policy advisors in\u000d\u000a      2010. This seminar contributed to the process of planning and writing the\u000d\u000a      NCW report, The Dollars\u000d\u000a        and Sense of Solving Poverty, published in Autumn 2011. According to\u000d\u000a      NCW Executive Director,\u000d\u000a      Haagh played a key role in persuading NCW members of the importance of BI.\u000d\u000a      The Executive\u000d\u000a      Director also credits Haagh with influencing NCW Chairperson John Rook and\u000d\u000a      NCW staff on the\u000d\u000a      merits of BI and how it might operate in the Canadian context. The impact\u000d\u000a      claimed here is that\u000d\u000a      Haagh made a major contribution to shaping the final report and thence the\u000d\u000a      public debate in\u000d\u000a      Canada. To quote the NCW Executive Director once more, `what was most\u000d\u000a      encouraging for the\u000d\u000a      future of basic income was that a group of people, most of whom were\u000d\u000a      unaware or even hostile to\u000d\u000a      the idea, came around dramatically to see its merits (and challenges)'.\u000d\u000a      The NCW report itself\u000d\u000a      stimulated active debate in Canada about poverty in general, and has seen\u000d\u000a      prominent\u000d\u000a      Conservative politicians (e.g. Senator Segal) and influential commentators\u000d\u000a      (e.g. Andrew Coyne)\u000d\u000a      express strong support for both the NCW report in general its focus on\u000d\u000a      basic income in particular.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Louise Haagh has played a major role in putting alternative welfare and\u000d\u000a      employment policy options\u000d\u000a      on the mainstream agenda. Haagh's comparative empirical research on basic\u000d\u000a      income (BI) provides\u000d\u000a      support for an approach to welfare that gives citizens unconditional,\u000d\u000a      universal economic\u000d\u000a      entitlements and multiple opportunities, through education, work, and\u000d\u000a      social care, to acquire the\u000d\u000a      economic stability needed to help themselves.

It contributes significantly to our understanding of the\u000d\u000a      impact of labour and welfare\u000d\u000a      policy interventions (income assistance, employment policy and labour\u000d\u000a      market regulation) on the\u000d\u000a      wellbeing and development of individual citizens and societies. Haagh's\u000d\u000a      empirical work underpins\u000d\u000a      the claim that poverty-reduction policies work best when they help\u000d\u000a      individual citizens to help\u000d\u000a      themselves. Her research supports the case for a universal BI, that is, an\u000d\u000a      unconditional right of\u000d\u000a      citizens to a regular income supported by a host of progressive public\u000d\u000a      finance measures to\u000d\u000a      facilitate the realisation of the individual citizen as a responsible,\u000d\u000a      self-reliant socio-economic agent.\u000d\u000a    The dominant global policy trend towards more targeted, means-tested and\u000d\u000a      behaviour-controlled\u000d\u000a      provision for the poorest groups is founded on empirical claims that the\u000d\u000a      poor lack incentives to\u000d\u000a      work if granted unconditional income support. In several linked projects\u000d\u000a      Haagh has shown that\u000d\u000a      these claims are unreliable: they depend upon ignoring other salient\u000d\u000a      factors (e.g. differences\u000d\u000a      between marginal and non-marginal groups, the impact of conditionality and\u000d\u000a      stability of income\u000d\u000a      support, the availability of other sources of opportunity\/economic\u000d\u000a      security such as continuing\u000d\u000a      education) and so should not ground policy decisions. Haagh's research\u000d\u000a      shows that the\u000d\u000a      relationship between economic security and work motivation is mediated by\u000d\u000a      the availability of\u000d\u000a      different forms of income support and the opportunities to access it.\u000d\u000a      These findings rest on a series\u000d\u000a      of empirical surveys conducted by Haagh in Chile (1992-95), South Korea\u000d\u000a      (1998-2002), Brazil\u000d\u000a      (2002-06) and Barbados (2008), funded variously by the British Academy,\u000d\u000a      Leverhulme Trust and\u000d\u000a      Nuffield Foundation.\u000d\u000a    Since 2007, Haagh has focused on welfare reforms in OECD countries\u000d\u000a      undergoing fiscal austerity.\u000d\u000a      She has examined the systemic background for the differential performance\u000d\u000a      of mature capitalist\u000d\u000a      states. Her findings show that horizontal models of capitalism that\u000d\u000a      promote a comprehensive and\u000d\u000a      diversified framework of economic security (prevalent in the Nordic\u000d\u000a      countries) perform better than\u000d\u000a      hierarchical models (prevalent in Anglo-Saxon countries and Latin America)\u000d\u000a      at delivering stable\u000d\u000a      economic incentives. The combination of progressive taxes and the\u000d\u000a      promotion of universal\u000d\u000a      entitlements and low inequality is shown to be most successful in\u000d\u000a      delivering the political legitimacy\u000d\u000a      and financial capability necessary for an effective and flexible economic\u000d\u000a      and welfare system.\u000d\u000a    Building on these insights, Haagh argues for policies that meet basic\u000d\u000a      subsistence needs and\u000d\u000a      facilitate individual capacity to acquire economic stability. Haagh's\u000d\u000a      research refutes the traditional\u000d\u000a      arguments for BI that regard it as a partial replacement for comprehensive\u000d\u000a      social security or\/and as\u000d\u000a      justifying the relatively high levels of income inequality generated in\u000d\u000a      the less-regulated capitalist\u000d\u000a      states. Instead, she argues that BI is most effective &#8212; and in the long\u000d\u000a      run more politically viable &#8212;\u000d\u000a      when part of a multifaceted system of policy intervention that promotes\u000d\u000a      the individual as an\u000d\u000a      independent economic actor while rejecting individualism in favour of\u000d\u000a      structures which provide fair\u000d\u000a      equality of opportunity for all.\u000d\u000a    Haagh has been at the University of York since 2001 as a Lecturer and\u000d\u000a      then a Reader.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43466","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2088628","Name":"Papua New Guinea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2134431","Name":"Vanuatu"},{"GeoNamesId":"4032283","Name":"Tonga"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Leftwich's `thinking and working politically' framework, encompassing\u000a      leadership, coalitions and political economy analysis, has had a\u000a      significant impact on the developing thinking, policy and practice of 1)\u000a      DfID, 2) AusAID and 3) the NGO development community.\u000a    1) A former DfID senior governance adviser regards Leftwich as `probably\u000a      one of the two or three most influential political scientists in the UK on\u000a      DfID and through that ministry on the international development\u000a      community'. DfID is a key player in international development policy,\u000a      being the world's third largest bilateral donor with an overall aid budget\u000a      in 2011 of &#163;4.2 billion. Leftwich prompted a paradigm shift in the\u000a      agency's approach to the governance agenda, from a narrow technocratic\u000a      focus on administrative capacity (formal structures and rules) to a much\u000a      broader conceptualisation of governance as a political process. In 2006,\u000a      he was commissioned by DfID to work on the DoC programme. The DoC was\u000a      launched in 2002 with the twin objectives of identifying `the long-term\u000a      structural and institutional factors which enable or constrain reform in\u000a      different countries' and `to improve policy-making and programming by\u000a      identifying short and medium-term opportunities to support strategic\u000a      change'. Leftwich's role was to produce `a robust conceptual framework\u000a      with a clear methodology' to enable DoC `to make a greater impact in\u000a      DfID's programming and policy-making' (DfID contract). Leftwich produced\u000a      three papers for the DoC project published during 2006 and presented his\u000a      findings at two DfID seminars: `Thinking Politically: It's The Politics,\u000a      Stupid' (7 December 2006) and `Understanding Politics &#8212; A New Framework\u000a      for Analysis' (30 January 2007).\u000a    This commissioned work, alongside Leftwich's prior academic research,\u000a      provided the conceptual foundations for a series of policy papers produced\u000a      subsequently by DfID between 2008 and 2010. Political Economy How To\u000a        Note: A Practice Paper (DfID 2008), for example, clearly shows\u000a      Leftwich's imprint on DfID's change of approach: `This represents a\u000a          major step change from past practice, when development\u000a      agencies frequently saw their role primarily in terms of the provision of\u000a      financial and technical assistance to promote particular agendas around\u000a      governance, growth or service delivery. The tendency was to dispense\u000a      advice on what \"should\" be done, without considering adequately the\u000a      constraints and opportunities created by the political environment.\u000a      Political economy analysis, in contrast, encourages donors to think not\u000a        only about what to support, but also about how to provide support,\u000a        taking political feasibility into account' (DfID 2008: 5). The paper\u000a      proceeds to set out a `Politics of Development Approach', designed `to\u000a      help DfID staff carry out political analysis...to help us to think\u000a      systematically about how political decisions are made.' (DfID\u000a      2008: 10).\u000a    Leftwich's ideas also informed DfID's 2009 White Paper, which\u000a      looked at the political challenges associated with promoting\u000a      state-building and development in conflict-affected and fragile states,\u000a      emphasising the political dynamics of security, justice and economic\u000a      growth. To quote the former DfID senior governance adviser once more,\u000a      `Adrian's research and writings had a deep influence on the political\u000a      economy analysis of DfID, and through DfID with the OECD Development\u000a      Assistance Committee membership. Adrian's influence was in highlighting\u000a      not only the complexity of politics but also its centrality to development\u000a      which had hitherto tried to pretend to be apolitical. His thinking gave\u000a      DfID a focus on power, and attention to the importance of leadership. This\u000a      fed through into DfID and OECD operational guidance on undertaking\u000a      analysis on `political will' behind development, thinking about fragile\u000a      states, and guidance notes on state-building, which in turn was reflected\u000a      in the DfID 2009 White Paper. Thanks in no small part to Adrian,\u000a      these topics, almost anathema a decade ago, are now very much part of the\u000a      regular development discourse'.\u000a    2) Leftwich's impact on AusAID has been considerable, particularly after\u000a      his appointment as Research Director of the DLP in 2010. As with DfID,\u000a      AusAID has since this time increasingly emphasised the importance of\u000a      political analysis in its development thinking, policies and programmes. Effective\u000a        Governance (AusAID 2011a), for example, embodies Leftwich's approach\u000a      in emphasising the importance of understanding local institutional\u000a      contexts via sound `political economy analysis' (p.15), working with\u000a      `civil society, local developmental leaders and coalitions for change'\u000a      (p.16) and employing a definition of leadership as `a political process\u000a      involving the skills of mobilising people and resources in pursuit of a\u000a      set of shared and negotiated goals'. Similarly, AusAID's (2011b) Framework\u000a        for Working in Fragile and Conflict-affected States recognises that\u000a      development challenges are `inherently complex, political and contested'\u000a      (p.9) and that agency programs `are developed based on an understanding of\u000a      local needs and a realistic diagnosis of local capacities' (p.25). A\u000a      senior AusAID official observes that Leftwich's work on politics and\u000a      leadership, particularly through the DLP, `has contributed significantly\u000a      to both UK and Australian development thinking, policies and programs, and\u000a      his impact can be seen elsewhere, for example with stakeholders such as\u000a      the International Development Assistance Committee... Across the board,\u000a      international aid agencies now recognise and better understand the\u000a      centrality and complexity of politics in development, the political\u000a      dynamics of economic growth and the role of local power and leaderships in\u000a      legitimate institutional change. Adrian's work contributed to these\u000a      achievements in no small measure. Few individuals can lay claim to such a\u000a      contribution' (Principal Director, Pacific Operations Group, AusAID).\u000a    AusAID is the major donor to the South Pacific accounting for more than\u000a      60 per cent of all bilateral aid flows to the region. AusAID programmes\u000a      shaped explicitly by Leftwich and the DLP include:\u000a    \u000a      The Pacific Leadership Program, which supports influential Pacific\u000a        leaders to shape and lead developmental change, emphasises the\u000a        importance of working within coalitions and networks of elite leaders\u000a        (e.g. setting up the Tongan National Leadership Development Forum) and\u000a        it uses political economic analysis to identify opportunities and\u000a        critical junctures that might enable or constrain reform (Regional\u000a        Director, Pacific Leadership Program, AusAID).\u000a      In Vanuatu, AusAID adopted a political approach to national\u000a        development by working closely with the National Council of Chiefs\u000a        through the Vanuatu Kastom Governance Partnership. AusAID's\u000a        understanding of the `contribution of Kastom leadership to change and\u000a        development processes' (AusAID, 2011b: 53) is influenced directly\u000a        by Leftwich's work on leadership and development.\u000a      In Papua New Guinea, AusAID supported the National Economic and Fiscal\u000a        Commission (NEFC), set up to reform the way that funding is distributed\u000a        to provincial areas. The success of NEFC is attributed to the\u000a        `combination of a strong, well-led agency, targeted donor support based\u000a        on analysis, local ownership and a participative reform process that\u000a        struck a balance between technical and political concerns' (AusAID 2010,\u000a        p.4). In short, the hallmarks of Leftwich's politically informed\u000a        approach to development.\u000a    \u000a    3) Leftwich's framework has also been taken up by key development NGOs.\u000a      The Asia Foundation (TAF), a major international developmental NGO that\u000a      disbursed over US$97m globally in programme support in 2011, provides\u000a      three examples of his influence:\u000a    \u000a      TAF applied the `working politically' framework to an evaluation of\u000a        its `Civil Society Initiative Against Poverty (CSIAP)' programme in\u000a        Indonesia (funded by DfID). It found that where mass-based Islamic civil\u000a        society organisations engaged in budget advocacy they could `tip the\u000a        balance' politically in achieving pro-poor budget allocations at the\u000a        decentralised level.\u000a      Leftwich's framework informed important recommendations for\u000a        developmental planning by DfID and other bilateral donors in Indonesia,\u000a        such as the need to supplement technical budget solutions with political\u000a        positioning and lobbying and that support for local actors to carry out\u000a        political-economy analysis and expand their political capital is `an\u000a        effective development investment' (Deputy Country Representative:\u000a        Indonesia, TAF).\u000a      TAF pioneered the use of Leftwich's political approach to the\u000a        governance agenda in the context of the environment. The framework was\u000a        used to develop a DfID funded programme on environmental governance in\u000a        Indonesia, the findings of which contributed to the design of an ongoing\u000a        &#163;7.6 million programme on `Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry in\u000a        Indonesia'. This programme specifically draws on the Leftwich's\u000a        framework and methodology to collect data for informing TAF partner\u000a        political strategies (e.g. by mapping elites and identifying the\u000a        coalitions they need to mobilise) required to achieve environmental\u000a        policy change at the local level (Deputy Country Representative:\u000a        Indonesia, TAF).\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Adrian Leftwich's work has made a decisive contribution to changing the\u000a      way that decision-makers understand `politics' in development policy and\u000a      practice.

From 2005 until his death in April 2013, Leftwich\u000a      played a leading role in the groundbreaking AusAID funded Developmental\u000a      Leadership Program (DLP) (www.dlprog.org),\u000a      which focuses on promoting leadership in developing countries. In\u000a      September 2010, Leftwich became full-time Research Director of the DLP\u000a      while remaining as Honorary Fellow in the Department of Politics. His work\u000a      in this area was furthered in the DfID-funded Improving Institutions\u000a        for Pro-Poor Growth project (a &#163;5 million project co-directed with\u000a      Professor Kunal Sen of the Manchester University from 2007-2010) and three\u000a      papers he was commissioned to write for the DfID Drivers of Change\u000a      (DoC) project.\u000a    The central theme running through Leftwich's work is the recognition of\u000a      politics beyond the formal apparatus of the state as an essential and\u000a      unavoidable process in all human collectivities, formal and\u000a      informal, public and private. In the context of development politics,\u000a      Leftwich argues for politics as an agent of change and for the necessity\u000a      of identifying political processes which drive or impede development and\u000a      change. In short, politics is of fundamental (though not exclusive)\u000a      importance in shaping development choices, strategies, trajectories and\u000a      outcomes. Development is an unavoidably transformative process affecting\u000a      social, economic and political relationships and institutions. It\u000a      therefore involves challenging the established `rules of the game'\u000a      regarding prevailing interests, power structures and institutional\u000a      arrangements.\u000a    Leftwich uses this conceptual framework for the political economy\u000a      analysis of the prospects for and possibilities of development in\u000a      different contexts. This framework assumes that politics operates at two\u000a      levels: first, there are rules of the game, the procedures and\u000a      processes which underpin and structure political life, and distribute\u000a      power and authorise its use in particular ways; and second, there are games\u000a        within the rules, the `normal' contestations over policy and power.\u000a      Whereas stable polities are typically characterised by broad consensus on\u000a      these `rules', in many developing countries they are not yet well\u000a      established, meaning that decisions are often made through informal\u000a      political processes. This absence of agreed rules leads to zero-sum\u000a      outcomes with `winners' and `losers', inducing pervasive unpredictability\u000a      and a lack of coherent and consistent development policy and planning.\u000a    With Leftwich, governance is understood as encompassing a broad set of\u000a      social institutions beyond formal mechanisms of decision making.\u000a      Leadership, secondly, is an unavoidably political process requiring the\u000a      skills necessary to mobilise people and resources in pursuit of agreed\u000a      development goals. Third, these political processes operate at national\u000a      and sub-national levels across all sectors of society, including business\u000a      organisations, trades unions, NGOs, professional bodies, churches and\u000a      bureaucracies. Fourth, understanding political processes in this way\u000a      enables aid donors to identify where, how and when they can intervene by\u000a      `working politically' to support the emergence and success of progressive\u000a      political processes and agencies (e.g. by mapping and identifying elites,\u000a      coalitions and critical junctures), that, in their turn, contribute to\u000a      poverty reduction and inclusive development.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43686","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research strongly influenced the 2012 report of the\u000d\u000a      Commons Justice Committee reviewing the operation of the FOI Act [see 1 in\u000d\u000a      section 5], and the Ministry of Justice memorandum submitted to that\u000d\u000a      review [2].\u000d\u000a    House of Commons Justice Committee\u000d\u000a    At its first evidence session on 21 February 2012 the Justice Committee\u000d\u000a      invited Hazell, Worthy and Amos (all of UCL) to give evidence [3]. The\u000d\u000a      research team also made three written submissions to the Commons Justice\u000d\u000a      Committee, which were published by the Committee (Ev 126, 169, 194 [4]).\u000d\u000a      They also gave private briefings for government ministers; senior\u000d\u000a      officials responsible for FOI; and for the Information Commissioner and\u000d\u000a      his staff.\u000d\u000a    The Committee's report on the Freedom of Information Act, Post\u000d\u000a        Legislative Scrutiny of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (HC\u000d\u000a      96-1, July 2012), makes over 40 references to the Constitution Unit's work\u000d\u000a      [1]. Typical references include: `The question whether the Act had\u000d\u000a      actually had an effect on public understanding of Government decision\u000d\u000a      making was explored by the Constitution Unit in its major piece of\u000d\u000a      research on whether the Act had achieved its objectives.' (para. 40); `The\u000d\u000a      Constitution Unit ... found that public participation in decision-making\u000d\u000a      had not been greatly improved in central Government because ...' (para.\u000d\u000a      41).\u000d\u000a    UCL research underpinned the Committee's conceptual approach. The\u000d\u000a      Committee adopted the same analytical approach as the Constitution Unit's\u000d\u000a      research, identifying the same two primary objectives and four secondary\u000d\u000a      objectives for FOI &#8212; to increase transparency strengthen accountability\u000d\u000a      for the former and to improve the quality of government decision making,\u000d\u000a      increase public understanding of government, increase public participation\u000d\u000a      and increase trust in government for the latter &#8212; (ch. 2 of [1],\u000d\u000a      especially para. 11). Citing the Constitution Unit's evidence 13 times,\u000d\u000a      the Committee came to the conclusions established by the research: the two\u000d\u000a      primary objectives of greater transparency and accountability had been\u000d\u000a      met, but the four secondary objectives had not (ch 2). On the secondary\u000d\u000a      objectives of improving the quality of government decision-making, and\u000d\u000a      increasing public understanding and public trust, the government cited the\u000d\u000a      Constitution Unit research and agreed with the findings (paras. 206-215).\u000d\u000a    The Committee found that the objective of increasing public trust and\u000d\u000a        confidence in Government, Parliament and other public authorities\u000d\u000a      may have been unrealistic because, as found following research by the\u000d\u000a      Constitution Unit, the vast majority of people experience freedom of\u000d\u000a      information through news stories and these are more likely to be negative\u000d\u000a      in tone than otherwise. The Committee noted the Constitution Unit research\u000d\u000a      as showing that the Act had had \"no generalisable impact on trust\" (para.\u000d\u000a      35), as well as the media analysis which had shown that the press tends to\u000d\u000a      use FOI stories to portray government in a negative light (paras. 35-37).\u000d\u000a    The Justice Committee devoted a separate chapter of their report to the\u000a        `chilling effect', the fear that FOI has damaged the quality of\u000d\u000a      policy advice and of the public record. They adopted the Constitution\u000d\u000a      Unit's definition of the chilling effect, and cited the research 15 times.\u000d\u000a      In the core section of the chapter the research was reported in nine\u000d\u000a      consecutive paragraphs, concluding:\u000d\u000a    \"The Constitution Unit's research on FOI is the first major piece of\u000d\u000a      research of its kind and is a valuable contribution to the debate around\u000d\u000a      FOI. In its consideration of the chilling effect, the Unit broadly\u000d\u000a      concluded that the effect of FOI appeared negligible to marginal. We note\u000d\u000a      this finding and have taken it into account in our deliberations\" (para.\u000d\u000a      190).\u000d\u000a    The next two paragraphs cited contrary evidence from Sir Gus O'Donnell,\u000d\u000a      but the report concluded that no legislative change was required.\u000d\u000a    The Justice Committee also used the research when assessing the costs\u000d\u000a        of FOI, at paras. 87 and 138. They drew upon the Unit's annual\u000d\u000a      surveys of the costs to local authorities (para. 87); its surveys of\u000d\u000a      requesters and their motivations (para. 41); and its finding that\u000d\u000a      publication schemes do not work (paras. 20, 24-5).\u000d\u000a    The Committee recognised the rigour of the research, relying as\u000d\u000a      it did on over 150 interviews and five different research methods. Their\u000d\u000a      report stated: \"The largest body of research on the impact of FOI is the\u000d\u000a      work carried out by the Constitution Unit between 2007 and 2009, looking\u000d\u000a      at its effect on central Government, local government and Parliament. As\u000d\u000a      the most important research-based source of evidence on FOI, it is worth\u000d\u000a      considering in some detail. The Unit's research methods included:\u000d\u000a      interviews with 56 officials in eight central Government departments, 90\u000d\u000a      officials and others across 16 local authorities, 30 MPs, peers and\u000d\u000a      officials at Westminster, as well as journalists, requesters and\u000d\u000a      campaigners; an online survey of FOI requesters; analysis of press\u000d\u000a      articles using FOI; analysis of FOI case law; and analysis of disclosure\u000d\u000a      logs\" (para. 182).\u000d\u000a    Ministry of Justice Memorandum\u000d\u000a    The Ministry of Justice Memorandum to the Commons Justice Committee (Dec\u000d\u000a      2011) makes frequent references to the Constitution Unit's research, which\u000d\u000a      is cited 12 times in the Memorandum itself, and 21 times in the Appendices\u000d\u000a      [2] In the Memorandum's literature review the Unit's research is cited in\u000d\u000a      half of all the footnotes (26 out of 56). The review opens by saying:\u000d\u000a      \"Much of the fieldwork in this topic area has been conducted by members of\u000d\u000a      the Constitution Unit at University College London's Department of\u000d\u000a      Political Science. Their research is methodologically robust, encompassing\u000d\u000a      multiple methodologies including quantitative surveys of FOI requesters,\u000d\u000a      officials and stakeholders; interviews with parliamentarians, civil\u000d\u000a      servants and Information Tribunal members; analysis of media coverage; and\u000d\u000a      analysis of Information Tribunal cases\" (p. 82).\u000d\u000a    Like the Justice Committee, the Memorandum adopted the UCL conceptual\u000d\u000a        approach identifying the same objectives (transparency and\u000d\u000a      accountability as primary and improving the quality of government decision\u000d\u000a      making, increasing public understanding of government, increasing public\u000d\u000a      participation and increasing trust in government as secondary (paras.\u000d\u000a      195-218 and pp. 84-87, [2]). The Memorandum came to similar conclusions as\u000d\u000a      the UCL research as to the extent to which these objectives had been\u000d\u000a      achieved.\u000d\u000a    On the question of trust, the Memorandum cites and endorses the\u000d\u000a      following conclusion from UCL research: \"FOI was oversold, by its\u000d\u000a      advocates and by ministers, and labours under the burden of unrealistic\u000d\u000a      objectives. To policy audiences we stress the need to lower expectations\u000d\u000a      of what FOI can deliver; and explain that FOI is unlikely ever to increase\u000d\u000a      trust, because the government's battle with the press over bad FOI stories\u000d\u000a      is one that can never be won\" (p. 87, [2]).\u000d\u000a    Reach of the impact\u000d\u000a    In advance of the 2012 review a number of senior politicians expressed\u000d\u000a      strong concerns about the FOI Act, with Tony Blair and Jack Straw claiming\u000d\u000a      that the Act had been a terrible mistake. They claimed it had stifled\u000d\u000a      frank advice and open discussion within government. The research findings\u000d\u000a      challenged this: there is very little evidence to substantiate the claim\u000d\u000a      that FOI had a chilling effect. Much stronger causal factors were the fear\u000d\u000a      of leaks, and changing administrative practices leading to poorer record\u000d\u000a      keeping.

In addition, Jim Amos was Honorary\u000d\u000a      Senior Research Associate at the Constitution Unit (2000-2013).\u000d\u000a    FOI is generally supposed to be a `good thing'. But why &#8212; what is it good\u000d\u000a      for? The key conceptual contribution of the research was to analyse its\u000d\u000a      objectives, and to develop a framework for evaluating its impact. Through\u000d\u000a      analysis of White Papers, ministerial speeches and parliamentary debates,\u000d\u000a      FOI was seen to have two primary aims: to increase transparency, and to\u000d\u000a      strengthen accountability. It also had four secondary aims: to improve the\u000d\u000a      quality of government decision-making; increase public understanding of\u000d\u000a      government; and increase public participation, and trust in government.\u000d\u000a    In examining the extent to which FOI had met its objectives, the research\u000d\u000a      included 175 interviews: mainly with officials, but also with MPs, peers,\u000d\u000a      journalists, FOI requesters and campaigners; an online survey of FOI\u000d\u000a      requesters; analysis of press articles using FOI; analysis of case law;\u000d\u000a      and analysis of public authorities' FOI disclosure logs.\u000d\u000a    In both projects FOI was found to have delivered the first two objectives\u000d\u000a      (transparency and accountability), but has not delivered the remaining\u000d\u000a      four (references [a] and [b] in section 3). The amount of information\u000d\u000a      released has significantly increased since the Act, and government is more\u000d\u000a      open. FOI has been used by the media, MPs and campaigners to make\u000d\u000a      government more accountable.\u000d\u000a    But interviews with officials suggested FOI had not improved the quality\u000d\u000a      of government decision-making. Nor had it increased public understanding,\u000d\u000a      because few requesters use the Act to access policy papers, and the media\u000d\u000a      rarely report policy disclosures. Public participation has not increased\u000d\u000a      as a result of FOI, because less than 1% of the population make FOI\u000d\u000a      requests. As for trust, newspaper reporting helps explain why FOI has not\u000d\u000a      increased trust, because two thirds of the FOI press stories which we\u000d\u000a      analysed were found likely to decrease trust.\u000d\u000a    The research found no evidence that FOI had adversely affected the\u000d\u000a      working of Whitehall, nor local government. Despite serious investigation\u000d\u000a      there was no evidence of a `chilling effect', which might have taken three\u000d\u000a      forms: reduction in the frankness of official advice; in the quality of\u000d\u000a      the official record; and in the supply of information to government. The\u000d\u000a      research concluded that when information is not properly recorded or\u000d\u000a      shared, it is generally due to factors other than FOI, such as fear of\u000d\u000a      leaks. The belief that FOI has a chilling effect is widespread, but there\u000d\u000a      is little hard evidence of this effect ([a,] [c], [d] and [e] in Section\u000d\u000a      3). The research findings thus challenged several powerful myths about\u000d\u000a      FOI: some advanced by FOI advocates (that FOI increases public\u000d\u000a      understanding and trust in government); some advanced by FOI critics (that\u000d\u000a      FOI has had a chilling effect on policy advice and deliberation within\u000d\u000a      government).\u000d\u000a    In 2008-09 the Constitution Unit did a separate study for the Information\u000d\u000a      Commissioner on policy advice which also covered the chilling effect. In\u000d\u000a      2010 we did some limited work on the costs of FOI. And from 2006 to 2011\u000d\u000a      we conducted an annual survey of FOI in local government, to assess the\u000d\u000a      volume of requests and their cost. All this information helped to inform\u000d\u000a      the Ministry of Justice, and the Commons Justice Committee when they\u000d\u000a      embarked on their Post-Legislative Scrutiny of FOI in 2012.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43687","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    To resolve the three urgent matters identified by the research (how the\u000a      Queen should appoint a Prime Minister in a hung Parliament; what powers\u000a      could be exercised by the previous government; and how the civil service\u000a      could support the process of government formation), the researchers\u000a      suggested that a stronger set of guidelines should be developed in the\u000a      form of a Cabinet Manual modelled on New Zealand's.\u000a    Hazell provided copies of the New Zealand Cabinet Manual to the Cabinet\u000a      Office. He also suggested to the Commons Justice Committee that they hold\u000a      a quick inquiry into preparations for the next election. In February 2010,\u000a      Hazell (UCL) and Peter Riddell (IfG) gave oral and written evidence to the\u000a      Committee, demonstrating the inadequacy of existing Cabinet guidance,\u000a      based on a comparison of the UK with Australia, Canada, Scotland and New\u000a      Zealand [see 1 in section 5]. This was followed by the Cabinet Secretary\u000a      Sir Gus O'Donnell announcing the preparation of a comprehensive Cabinet\u000a      Manual, and publication of the key chapter on government formation before\u000a      the 2010 general election [2]. Thus, only ten weeks after the 2009 report\u000a      appeared, the Cabinet Office published Elections and Government\u000a        Formation as a guide to the process of government formation.\u000a    The specific contributions of the chapter published as Elections and\u000a        Government Formation were: to provide essential guidance about the\u000a      process of government formation in the event of a hung Parliament; to\u000a      bring together in one place political and administrative guidance for the\u000a      Cabinet, which the research had shown was non-existent, or fragmented and\u000a      hard to find; and to codify for the first time the key constitutional\u000a      conventions on appointing a Prime Minister. The Manual included two\u000a      innovations which the Constitution Unit report proposed to the Cabinet\u000a      Office: (1) an extension of the `caretaker convention' to restrict\u000a      government decision-making in three different contexts: the run-up to the\u000a      election, the period of government formation, and a mid-term loss of\u000a      confidence (paras. 67-71 of the published Cabinet Manual [3]) and (2)\u000a      provision of civil service support for the political parties negotiating\u000a      after an election (paras. 51-53).\u000a    Until the publication of Elections and Government Formation the\u000a      process of appointing a new Prime Minister had been shrouded in mystery,\u000a      leading to speculation that an uncertain election result would lead to\u000a      chaos, or that the Queen herself might be required to choose. There was no\u000a      agreed understanding that the previous government might continue in office\u000a      until a new government was formed. There had also been nervousness in the\u000a      financial markets about prolonged uncertainty following the election.\u000a      Hazell (together with the Institute for Government) spoke at events in the\u000a      City of London to explain what would happen, for example at the City\u000a      Corporation on 11 March, and to the London Chamber of Commerce on 23\u000a      March. Researchers also briefed the political parties on, among other\u000a      topics, the constitutional rules of government formation, how the parties\u000a      would need to negotiate and the caretaker convention.\u000a    To enhance the accuracy of media coverage, Hazell spoke at four private\u000a      briefings for broadcasters (two for the BBC, one at Millbank and one at TV\u000a      Centre; one big meeting for all ITN and C4 news teams; one for Sky) and\u000a      for the press and Foreign Press Association arranged in partnership with\u000a      the Institute of Government. In the run up to the election Hazell also\u000a      gave 15 interviews to UK and foreign broadcasters. During the `Five Days\u000a      in May' he was part of the BBC and ITV election coverage teams, and gave\u000a      over 25 broadcast interviews to explain the process of government\u000a      formation in a hung Parliament (eg for ITN on 6 and 7 May; BBC TV News and\u000a      BBC Politics Show on 8 and 9 May) [4].\u000a    These activities to promote research impact were supplemented by\u000a      activities of broader public engagement. On 9 May 2010 Hazell published\u000a      `Keep calm and carry on talking: Whitehall has been preparing for this for\u000a      months' in The Sunday Times. He also provided a YouTube\u000a      mini-lecture, `A Hung Parliament Explained' (10 Mar 2010), which at the\u000a      time of this submission has been viewed more than 97,000 times [5].\u000a    The `Five Days in May' went smoothly. That was not a foregone conclusion.\u000a      But partly thanks to Constitution Unit briefings, none of the papers\u000a      declared that Cameron had `won' the election, nor did they whip up panic\u000a      amongst the public. The civil service supported the negotiations between\u000a      the parties, for the first time ever; the old government remained in\u000a      office for five days during the coalition negotiations; the Queen was not\u000a      drawn in until it was clear who could command confidence in the new\u000a      Parliament; the markets remained calm. The wider beneficiaries were the UK\u000a      electorate, who observed an orderly transition and formation of the first\u000a      coalition government in 60 years. As the Guardian observed in an\u000a      editorial titled `In Praise of the Constitution Unit' on 23 July 2010:\u000a    Its report last year on minority parliaments shaped the Cabinet\u000a      Secretary's thinking, and so helped lead to this spring's unexpectedly\u000a      smooth transition to the coalition [6].\u000a    Following the formation of the government, the Cabinet Office began\u000a      preparing a complete Cabinet Manual explicitly modelled on the New Zealand\u000a      example, as recommended by UCL researchers. A consultation draft was\u000a      published in December 2010, and the first full Cabinet Manual was produced\u000a      in October 2011 [3].\u000a    Once again, Robert Hazell was consulted by the Cabinet Office on\u000a      successive drafts of the Manual during 2010, and had several meetings with\u000a      Sir Gus O'Donnell to discuss the drafts. When the work in Whitehall was\u000a      going slowly, UCL's Dr Ben Yong, an expert on the New Zealand Cabinet\u000a      Manual, was seconded to them for six months (March-September 2010). Hazell\u000a      and Yong were twice invited to give evidence to the Political and\u000a      Constitutional Reform Committee [7], and to take part in a private seminar\u000a      of the Commons Public Administration Committee in March 2011.\u000a    At these events, the researchers explained to Committee members the\u000a      significance of the Cabinet Manual, and sought to allay their fears that\u000a      it was wrong for the Executive to offer its own interpretation of\u000a      constitutional conventions, as well as successfully challenging specific\u000a      statements in the draft that contravened constitutional principles. For\u000a      example, the draft suggested \"whichever party has won the most votes and\u000a      the most seats, if not an absolute majority, has the first right to seek\u000a      to govern, either on its own or by reaching out to other parties\". Hazell\u000a      pointed out this was wrong: the constitutional principle was that the\u000a      Queen should appoint as Prime Minister the person who commanded the\u000a      confidence of Parliament (who need not necessarily be the leader of the\u000a      largest party). As acknowledged in the committee's report, the offending\u000a      passage was deleted on this recommendation [8].\u000a    As a result, as of October 2011, the UK has a published Cabinet Manual\u000a      which lays out clearly the main laws and processes that govern the conduct\u000a      and operation of the government, and of government formation. In summer\u000a      2013, the new Cabinet Secretary consulted Hazell about Cabinet Office\u000a      preparations for the next election, and the BBC started consulting him\u000a      about its election coverage.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Before the UK's 2010 election there were widespread fears that a hung\u000a      Parliament might lead to political and economic chaos. Research conducted\u000a      and published by the UCL Constitution Unit showed both the necessity for a\u000a      Cabinet Manual to guide the process of forming a new government in the\u000a      event of a hung Parliament, and examined the best models available.\u000a      Although the full Cabinet Manual was published in 2011, the Cabinet Office\u000a      published a key chapter (Elections and Government Formation) before\u000a      the 2010 general election. The chapter, which drew heavily on the insights\u000a      of and recommendations made in the UCL research, helped ensure in May 2010\u000a      an orderly transition to government of the first coalition in 60 years.\u000a      That transition was also supported by the researchers' use of their\u000a      findings to enhance understanding among professional, media and public\u000a      audiences of what would happen in the event of a hung parliament.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    University College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2643743","Name":"London"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[a] R.

Between\u000a      2000 and 2003, Professor Robert Hazell (Director of the UCL Constitution\u000a      Unit) and Ben Seyd, Senior Research Fellow at UCL (1997-2005), led a\u000a      comparative research project, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, that\u000a      analysed coalition governments in Denmark, Germany, Ireland and New\u000a      Zealand to provide findings intended to inform the process of coalition\u000a      formation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This line of research\u000a      was revived in 2009 with the prospect of a hung Parliament in Westminster.\u000a    The central finding of the 2009 research was the need for a Cabinet\u000a      Manual to provide guidance in the event of a hung parliament. In line with\u000a      the Unit's commitment to impact through collaborative research, the\u000a      project leader Robert Hazell (with Ben Yong and Mark Chalmers at UCL)\u000a      worked alongside Akash Paun and Catherine Haddon at the Institute for\u000a      Government (IfG). The research looked at minority and coalition government\u000a      in Westminster systems, working closely with the Cabinet Office and\u000a      Buckingham Palace. The research &#8212; involving 60 interviews with ministers,\u000a      politicians, civil servants and experts &#8212; established that recent\u000a      experience in Canada, with its unstable minority governments and\u000a      constitutional crises, supported a widely held view in Westminster that\u000a      minority governments are weak, unstable and short-term in approach to\u000a      policy. In New Zealand and Scotland, however, minority governments were\u000a      shown to be much more effective, offering lessons on how to facilitate a\u000a      stable transition. Yong worked on the analysis of the New Zealand\u000a      experience, and Chalmers on the Canadian, while Paun and Haddon worked on\u000a      Scotland and the Lib-Lab Pact in 1977-78. Hazell wrote the concluding\u000a      chapters, on the lessons for Westminster and Whitehall.\u000a    The report ([a] in section 3) was jointly published by the Constitution\u000a      Unit and Institute for Government, with five out of the seven chapters\u000a      written by Hazell, Yong and Chalmers from UCL. The main findings were: (1)\u000a      Westminster and Whitehall were unprepared for a hung Parliament; (2) the\u000a      media had very little understanding of the conventions guiding the process\u000a      of government formation; and (3) guidance needed to be issued before the\u000a      election. The report identified three matters which required urgent\u000a      clarification: how the Queen should appoint a Prime Minister in a hung\u000a      Parliament; what powers could still be exercised by the previous\u000a      government on a caretaker basis; and how the civil service could better\u000a      support the process of government formation. It was suggested that a\u000a      stronger set of guidelines needed development, in the form of a Cabinet\u000a      Manual modelled on New Zealand's.\u000a    To ensure impact, the Cabinet Office and the Queen's private secretary\u000a      were shown a draft of the report in October 2009, and Hazell chaired the\u000a      UK group at a Ditchley conference in November on Managing the\u000a        Machinery of Government in Periods of Change [c]. In December,\u000a      Cabinet Office, Ministry of Justice and Palace officials attended the\u000a      launch of the report. Its conclusions were summarised in an article in the\u000a      Political Quarterly a month before the 2010 election [b],\u000a      accompanied by comment pieces from Lord Turnbull (former Cabinet\u000a      Secretary), Sir Alan Beith MP (Chair, Commons Justice Committee), Paul\u000a      Evans (senior House of Commons clerk) and Michael Crick (then Political\u000a      Editor, BBC Newsnight).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43928","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As summarised in section 1, HSP research has had two types of impact:\u000a    Benefits to CBW expert and policy communities:\u000a    HSP researchers work continually with governments, international\u000a      organisations and NGOs in the CBW field, providing wide-ranging benefits\u000a      to CBW debates and policy. This work `has provided solid evidence-based\u000a      information and argument that has helped sustain UK work in negotiating\u000a      and implementing the CWC, maintaining the effectiveness of the BWC and\u000a      sustaining the overall efficacy of the international regime against the\u000a      misuse of biology and chemistry. HSP's work over the last twenty years and\u000a      more has helped shape UK perceptions of the issues in hand, the challenges\u000a      faced and possible steps that could be taken to address them' [C1]. This\u000a      work includes:\u000a    \u000a      Information gathering and dissemination, including: maintaining the\u000a        Sussex Harvard Information Bank, considered the world's largest open\u000a        archive of published and unpublished material on CBW, which is used\u000a        regularly by CBW researchers and policymakers; maintaining a CBW events\u000a        database, recording 15,000 CBW events since 1987; and editing the CBW\u000a        Convention's Bulletin, the journal of record in the field from\u000a        1993-2011.\u000a      Advisory work, including with actors involved in the CBW Conventions,\u000a        the UN, the G8 Global Partnership, the WHO, the ICRC, the UK National\u000a        Authority for the Chemical Weapons Convention, the European Commission,\u000a        Human Rights Watch, the Bioweapons Prevention Project, the UK Royal\u000a        Society and committees of the US National Academies, and most recently\u000a        an amicus curia brief for the US Supreme Court in the Bond\u000a        case [C2].\u000a      Outreach events, including the organisation or hosting of more than 30\u000a        expert seminars (many of which have been in coordination with other\u000a        institutions, including governments).\u000a      Direct support for policy processes via briefings and reviews,\u000a        including several hundred page guides for the CWC and BWC Review\u000a        Conferences, commissioned and funded by state parties including the UK\u000a        [C3]. Illustrative of the value of these documents, HSP's 2011 Briefing\u000a        Book for the BWC was publicly commended by the US State Department's\u000a        Deputy Director of Chemical\/Biological Weapons Policy as `a survival\u000a        guide for delegates and interested parties' [C4]. This Briefing Book was\u000a        presented to the President of the Review Conference by the UK's\u000a        Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, and orally commended by him.\u000a      Sustained single-issue advocacy and\/or policy innovation, including:\u000a        on-going development and promotion of HSP's draft treaty on\u000a        international criminalisation of individuals' involvement in CBW\u000a        development and use, including through evidence presented to the UK\u000a        Foreign Affairs Select Committee [C5]; and proposals for building Dual\u000a        Use education into higher education curricula, referenced by, inter\u000a        alia, the WHO and the US National Academies of Science [C6].\u000a    \u000a    Issue-specific impacts:\u000a    In addition, HSP research has had issue-specific impacts, illustrated\u000a      here in relation to the three areas of research discussed in section 2:\u000a    (1) Yellow rain: The yellow rain controversy continues to this\u000a      day. The US government maintains its initial case, but most other\u000a      governments and experts support HSP's bee defecation explanation [C7].\u000a      Critical lessons for the practice of investigating alleged use have been\u000a      widely drawn from this research. For example, a 2008 article co-authored\u000a      by Sir David Omand, former UK Security and Intelligence Coordinator, and\u000a      published in a CIA journal, describes this as `a well-documented case that\u000a      illustrates the pitfalls' of verifying allegations of CBW use,\u000a      specifically acknowledging the role of HSP research [C8]. Partly as a\u000a      result of the yellow rain controversy, improved methods have now been\u000a      introduced for dealing with such allegations: a senior governmental\u000a      representative has stated that HSP's work `on yellow rain helped\u000a      underscore the need for effective international mechanisms for\u000a      investigating allegations of CBW use, which has been a long-term UK\u000a      objective' [C1]. Indeed, the yellow rain incident has become viewed as\u000a      paradigmatic of the complexities involved in attributing responsibility\u000a      for (real or alleged) chemical weapons use. For example, it has been\u000a      widely revisited in expert and public discussions over the August 2013 use\u000a      of chemical weapons in Syria [C9].\u000a    (2) Incapacitating agents: HSP has collaborated widely with civil\u000a      society organisations and scientific communities in developing\u000a      recommendations and pressuring governments on this issue. Robinson served,\u000a      for example, on the committee of the Royal Society's influential Brain\u000a      Waves project, and is extensively cited in its final report [C10], and HSP\u000a      has also worked on the issue through Pugwash and the ICRC. A major HSP\u000a      objective has been to strengthen the position of those in government who\u000a      argue for constraints and are in a position to inhibit backsliding from\u000a      existing policies. Traces of impact can be gleaned from the contributions\u000a      of HSP to the UK Foreign Affairs Committee's 2009 Report on\u000a      non-proliferation [C5]; and from instructions provided to the US\u000a      delegation to the CWC, published by Wikileaks: these state that `a growing\u000a      interest among British NGOs in discussing' incapacitating agents may place\u000a      the UK `under considerably more pressure to demonstrate increased\u000a      flexibility in entertaining discussions and possibly even report language'\u000a      [C11]. A senior government official has stated that HSPs work on\u000a      incapacitating agents `has contributed to UK policy formulation and led\u000a      indirectly to the statement made by Alastair Burt at the Third CWC Review\u000a      Conference in 2013', where he clarified UK policy on the issue [C1]. Civil\u000a      society pressure has resulted in the UK, US, Germany and Switzerland all\u000a      clarifying or amending their positions on this issue since 2008 [C12].\u000a    (3) Science and Technology reviews: This research has fed\u000a      directly into international policy discussions. A range of policy options\u000a      for reform of review procedures were developed by HSP researchers, and\u000a      were communicated via, inter alia, a series of specially designed policy\u000a      briefing papers; tailored presentations to government officials; and\u000a      presentations at the UN including one that led a senior Indian diplomat to\u000a      call the project a `model means of engaging policy makers' [C13]. The\u000a      research has been extensively cited, including by the UK National\u000a      Academies of Science, and in US government-authored national papers\u000a      submitted to the BWC [C14]. Building in part upon the reform options\u000a      identified by HSP, the process by which Science and Technology is reviewed\u000a      under the BWC was changed at the Seventh Review Conference [C15]. HSP\u000a      research on this issue continues to have impact, being raised two years\u000a      later in discussions about how best to accommodate and review Science and\u000a      Technology advances relevant to the CWC [C16].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study documents the research and impact of Sussex members of\u000a      the Harvard Sussex Program (HSP) on chemical and biological weapons (CBW).\u000a      Since 2008, HSP has provided a wide range of benefits to CBW expert and\u000a      policy communities, through information gathering and dissemination,\u000a      advisory work, outreach events, and briefings and reviews, as well as\u000a      single-issue advocacy and policy innovation.

Its mission is to bring\u000a      scholarship to bear on the formation of public policy on chemical and\u000a      biological weapons, in order to maintain and strengthen constraints on\u000a      their development and use. HSP is widely recognised as the leading centre\u000a      worldwide for research on CBW control. This case study documents the work\u000a      of Sussex members of the program, specifically that of Julian Perry\u000a      Robinson (founding HSP Co-Director, now Emeritus Professor), Caitr&#237;ona\u000a      McLeish (current Co-Director, at Sussex since 2002), and James Revill\u000a      (Research Fellow, at Sussex since 2010), as well as former HSP researchers\u000a      Daniel Feakes (2000-2009) and Catherine Jefferson (2009-2010).\u000a    While HSP research has addressed a broad range of issues related to CBW,\u000a      this case study pays particular attention to impacts arising from three\u000a      areas of research:\u000a    (1) Yellow rain: In 1981, the US government accused the\u000a      Soviet-backed Laotian and Vietnamese forces of conducting toxin warfare\u000a      against Hmong villagers who had sided with the United States during the\u000a      Vietnam War and also against anti-Vietnamese forces in Cambodia. HSP\u000a      research showed, however, that the `yellow rain' was actually a result of\u000a      honeybee defecation. This research began prior to 1993 but continued\u000a      throughout the 1990s and remains on-going [see Section 3, R1] due to its\u000a      paradigmatic significance for assessing allegations of CBW use.\u000a    (2) Incapacitating agents: These agents are intended to disable\u000a      people and put them out of action for extended periods of time without\u000a      causing death or permanent harm and are prohibited under the 1993 Chemical\u000a      Weapons Convention (CWC), except when intended for the loosely specified\u000a      purposes that the Convention does not prohibit. Thus far, the technology\u000a      involved has lagged behind the hopes of their advocates &#8212; as was shown by\u000a      the 129 hostage deaths resulting from their use during the operation to\u000a      end the 2002 `Dubrovka' theatre siege in Moscow. Yet since then, there has\u000a      been a creeping legitimisation of their use in counter-terrorism\u000a      operations &#8212; a move that threatens the integrity of the CWC. HSP\u000a      researchers have written extensively on this issue, challenging the\u000a      creeping legitimisation of incapacitating agents [R2].\u000a    (3) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) reviews: Recent HSP research\u000a      on this issue has shown that the S&amp;T review processes within the\u000a      Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) are not only under-utilised but also\u000a      based on outmoded models of scientific and technological change. Using\u000a      bibliometric analysis, case studies, interviews and questionnaires, HSP\u000a      identified various possible alternative review procedures, and analysed\u000a      them for their strengths and weaknesses [R3, R4].\u000a    Since 1993, HSP research has been supported by grants from the ESRC, the\u000a      EC's Sixth Framework and CBRN Action Plan, the MacArthur Foundation, the\u000a      Carnegie Corporation, the Sloan Foundation, and the foreign ministries of\u000a      Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK. All of the above research has\u000a      involved HSP-Sussex participation.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43945","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As summarised in Section 1, this research has had impact in the following\u000a      four areas:\u000a    1. The work of the UN CDM Executive Board:\u000a    In 2011, the UN CDM Executive Board (EB), which is the highest\u000a      governmental decision-making\u000a      body on carbon markets, held a closed retreat to discuss challenges facing\u000a      the CDM in the wake of\u000a      a series of crises engulfing global carbon markets. A briefing note on\u000a      Newell's research was\u000a      produced for this retreat, following an invitation to `well-known leaders\u000a      and thinkers in this area'\u000a      [see Section 5, C1]. This was shared with Board members and made a `key\u000a      contribution' to\u000a      ensuring the success of the retreat [C2]. The most significant outcome of\u000a      the retreat was\u000a      agreement to launch a Policy Dialogue on the CDM.\u000a    2. The UN's Policy Dialogue on the CDM:\u000a    Newell's engagement with this Policy Dialogue process involved: the\u000a      formal submission of\u000a      evidence to the Dialogue Panel; the distribution of this evidence to a\u000a      range of governmental and\u000a      non-governmental stakeholders, including the UK government and the then\u000a      chair of the CDM EB\u000a      who participated in a public debate about the research [C3]; the\u000a      dissemination of academic\u000a      publications to many of the same stakeholders; and various presentations,\u000a      including the May 2012\u000a      UN climate change negotiations in Bonn, at an event organised by the NGO CDM\u000a        Watch [C4]. The\u000a      chair and discussant at this event, who were both members of the CDM\u000a      Policy Dialogue High-Level\u000a\u0009  Panel, directly engaged with the evidence presented and expressed\u000a      their commitment to\u000a      take forward its findings [C5]. This engagement activity in turn had the\u000a      following impact:\u000a    (i) UK government submission: The research and formal evidence\u000a      were extensively drawn upon by\u000a      the UK Department for International Development in its submission to the\u000a      Policy Dialogue. This\u000a      submission called for efforts to improve the governance of the CDM,\u000a      including an appeals\u000a      mechanism; improved local consultation and stakeholder engagement,\u000a      including the promotion of\u000a      best practice; ex-post assessments of the sustainable development\u000a      contributions of projects; and\u000a      sanctions for projects failing to deliver these outcomes. These proposals\u000a      drew heavily upon and\u000a      directly mirrored those called for in Newell's research and submission to\u000a      the Dialogue Panel [C6].\u000a    (ii) Policy Dialogue paper on governance: Significant traces of\u000a      Newell's research are evident in a\u000a      key Policy Dialogue report. This report recommended that the CDM EB\u000a      `assist DNAs (Designated\u000a      National Authorities) in coordinating more effective local stakeholder\u000a      consultations and improve the\u000a      accountability of project proponents to local communities throughout CDM\u000a      project design and\u000a      implementation' [C7]. This recommendation directly mirrored Newell's\u000a      proposal for an alternative\u000a      CDM governance process based on clear national development strategies,\u000a      common guidance on\u000a      public consultation, strengthened DNA capacity, and continuous monitoring\u000a      and ex-post validation\u000a      [C4].\u000a    (iii) Final reports: Likewise, the final Synthesis Report of the\u000a      Dialogue process reproduced several\u000a      of the main findings of Newell's research. This includes statements that\u000a      `[M]ost studies employ\u000a      varying criteria to assess impacts and occasionally lack any ex-post\u000a      assessments, relying on\u000a      information provided by project developers when requesting registration,\u000a      rather than on post-implementation\u000a\u0009  data'; that `[C]omparison of projects across different\u000a      countries shows that their\u000a      contribution to sustainable development depends both on project type and\u000a      host country'; and that\u000a      `[s]ome stakeholders indicate that the capacity of host countries to\u000a      follow-up on the initial\u000a      assessment of a project's contribution to sustainable development is\u000a      limited given the paucity of\u000a      resources in many cases' [C8]. Key recommendations from Newell's research\u000a      also featured\u000a      prominently in the Final Report of the High-Level Panel, including its\u000a      call for the CDM to\u000a      `strengthen and restructure its governance' by `enhancing its openness and\u000a      transparency, and\u000a      opportunities for stakeholder participation, creating avenues to hear\u000a      appeals and address\u000a      grievances'. This included the increased monitoring of sustainable\u000a      development benefits, efforts to\u000a      strengthen national capacity in this regard, sanctions in cases of harm\u000a      caused by projects, and\u000a      guidelines on adequate local consultation procedures. Echoing the\u000a      recommendations of the\u000a      research, it is stated that `There is a clear need to improve the\u000a      reporting, monitoring, and\u000a      verification of the sustainable development impacts of CDM projects, and\u000a      to implement safeguards\u000a      against projects with negative impacts' [C9].\u000a    In the wake of this Final Report and the pressure generated by\u000a      researchers and NGOs, state\u000a      Parties to the UN climate negotiations called on the CDM EB to act. It did\u000a      so by approving a\u000a      voluntary tool for describing sustainable development co-benefits of CDM\u000a      projects at its 70th Board\u000a      meeting in November 2012, moving away from original opposition to\u000a      acceptance of an additional\u000a      tool for recording such benefits. In light of the shortcomings highlighted\u000a      by this and other research,\u000a      the CDM EB has also sought to encourage governments to share experiences\u000a      of local consultation\u000a      processes.\u000a    3. Advisory and training work:\u000a    Newell has also undertaken extensive advisory and training work, with\u000a      impacts on policy\u000a      processes. For example, Newell serves as Senior Policy Advisor on the UK\u000a      Department of Energy\u000a      and Climate Change's (DECC's) International Climate Fund, in which\u000a      capacity he has served as an\u000a      evaluator of business cases for the joint DFID\/DECC Carbon Markets Finance\u000a      initiative and has\u000a      provided input which has had direct impacts on the design and development\u000a      of this initiative, aimed\u000a      at improving the development benefits of CDM projects [C10].\u000a    He has also provided training for various policy bodies on the CDM, some\u000a      of which have, in turn,\u000a      had direct impact. For example, Newell participated in a training session\u000a      for the Commonwealth\u000a      Parliamentary Association, at the end of which the parliamentarians\u000a      attending issued a\u000a      communiqu&#233; calling for tougher action on climate change which specifically\u000a      emphasised the `risks\u000a      from international carbon trading mechanisms' highlighted by Newell [C11].\u000a    4. Public awareness of the shortcomings of carbon markets:\u000a    Key findings from Newell's research have been extensively covered in all\u000a      forms of mass media.\u000a      Leading broadsheets covering the research have included The Guardian,\u000a      The Times of South\u000a        Africa and The Financial Times, for whom Newell produced an\u000a      interactive guide on climate politics\u000a      in the run-up to the December 2011 Durban conference. The research has\u000a      been covered on\u000a      numerous TV and radio channels, including Sky News, BBC News 24,\u000a      BBC Radio 2 and BBC\u000a      World in Spanish, which featured a full-page story on Newell's\u000a      research [C12]. Newell's research\u000a      has also featured in the `The Carbon Con' documentary, which was\u000a      screened at the Durban\u000a      conference at a side-event with panel discussion organised by CDM Watch,\u000a      and has been\u000a      downloaded from YouTube and other media over 3,000 times [C13]. Newell's\u000a      research has also\u000a      been widely cited and drawn upon by advocacy NGOs working on change\u000a      issues, including the\u000a      Rainforest Foundation, the Global Forest Coalition and The Corner House in\u000a      the UK [C14].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study focuses on the governance dimensions of the Clean\u000a      Development Mechanism,\u000a      established under the Kyoto Protocol, and on how these affect its\u000a      contributions to sustainable\u000a      development.

The CDM is a market-based offset\u000a      mechanism\u000a      created under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol which allows richer countries, with\u000a      legal obligations to\u000a      reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, to pay poorer ones for projects\u000a      that reduce these\u000a      emissions more cheaply. In return, developing countries are meant to\u000a      receive local sustainable\u000a      development benefits, such as jobs, technology and improved health and\u000a      environmental outcomes.\u000a      Whereas most research to date has looked at market-based explanations for\u000a      the performance of\u000a      the CDM, this work analyses the difference that governance makes to the\u000a      realisation of sustainable\u000a      development benefits from CDM projects.\u000a    The research has highlighted a number of key governance deficits in\u000a      relation to participation,\u000a      accountability, coordination and capacity, which are inhibiting the\u000a      ability of governments to realise\u000a      sustainable developmental benefits from CDM projects. The research\u000a      examined these governance\u000a      issues at a range of levels, from the UN's CDM Executive Board (EB), to\u000a      national governments that\u000a      have responsibility for approving and screening projects, down to local\u000a      bodies that oversee\u000a      consultations and participation with local communities about the risks and\u000a      benefits of projects they\u000a      are asked to host. It found widespread evidence of collusion, corruption\u000a      and exclusion in decision-making\u000a\u0009  and project approval processes. Unlike many desk-based evaluations\u000a      of projects, the\u000a      research pointed to the importance of getting to grips with issues of\u000a      power, politics and political\u000a      economy as significant shapers of `who gets what, when and how' from CDM\u000a      projects. It found that\u000a      decision-making tends to revolve around tightly-knit networks of project\u000a      developers, financiers,\u000a      regulators and auditors, while many key stakeholders are not adequately\u000a      consulted. The research\u000a      also found many examples of a revolving door between national officials,\u000a      project developers and\u000a      verification agencies, often even occupying more than one role at the same\u000a      time. The research\u000a      highlighted the need for redress mechanisms and efforts to monitor and\u000a      evaluate whether or not\u000a      sustainable development benefits are being delivered by projects, as well\u000a      as to ensure that\u000a      adequate opportunities are provided for participation in and consultation\u000a      over the projects.\u000a    This research was conducted by Peter Newell. Initial research was carried\u000a      out whilst he was at\u000a      the University of East Anglia, before moving to Sussex in August 2011.\u000a      Field work for this research\u000a      (in Argentina, India and South Africa) was conducted from UEA, but the\u000a      analysis, writing up,\u000a      dissemination and publication of the research were undertaken at Sussex\u000a      [see Section 3, R1, R2,\u000a      R3]. While at Sussex, Newell's research in this area has been supported by\u000a      the ESRC (as a\u000a      Climate Change Leadership Fellow and through a grant on low carbon\u000a      transitions in Southern\u000a      Africa), and the Climate and Development Knowledge Network.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43954","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As summarised in section 1, this research has had impacts in four areas:\u000a    1. [text removed for publication]\u000a    2. Enhanced public and policy understanding and debate:\u000a    Selby's published analysis of the JWC negotiation archives [R4] has\u000a      generated extensive debate, and some policy change. This research was\u000a      intentionally published in an open access journal to maximise non-academic\u000a      readership. It was also presented to a range of policymaking audiences\u000a      (including in the West Bank, and at the European Commission); and was\u000a      summarised in a widely disseminated policy briefing [C5].\u000a    The findings of this research were extensively covered within the\u000a      Israeli, Palestinian and international media, including in The\u000a        Guardian, the leading liberal Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz,\u000a      and the Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds [C6]. They were disseminated\u000a      by Palestinian civil society organisations, international Palestinian\u000a      solidarity groups, and international donor organisations supporting the\u000a      Palestinian water sector [C7]. They were also widely read and circulated\u000a      by local and international policymakers. For example, the research was\u000a      read and commented upon within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and\u000a      distributed to the UK Consulate in Jerusalem and the UK Embassies in Tel\u000a      Aviv and Amman, as it provided information on the subject which was\u000a      previously not known to British officials [C8]. The research has already\u000a      been extensively cited, for example by the leading Palestinian human\u000a      rights NGO Al-Haq [C9]. Indicative of the impact of this research, Selby\u000a      has been invited to present it before the Arab League [C10].\u000a    In turn, the research has generated public discussion on the JWC and\u000a      appropriate political responses to it. Within the Palestinian water\u000a      community, the revelation of the extent of PWA approval of settlement\u000a      infrastructure provoked extensive and heated debate, culminating in a\u000a      former head of the PWA &#8212; the Palestinian official who had been most\u000a      centrally involved in approving settlement water facilities &#8212; writing a\u000a      7,000 word response [C11]. Disappointingly (though unsurprisingly, given\u000a      the weakness of the anti-occupation movement within Israeli society),\u000a      there has been no equivalent debate within Israel.\u000a    The research has also enhanced understanding and contributed to policy\u000a      change amongst international donors. Selby's research showed that\u000a      donor-funded water projects in the West Bank have often been approved\u000a      because the PWA was simultaneously approving settlement facilities, and\u000a      thus that donors have, whether wittingly or unwittingly, been complicit in\u000a      activity which they themselves view as illegal and a major obstacle to\u000a      peace. While a few donors had previously known about this, most donors did\u000a      not: for example, according to the ICRC, it was not aware that approval of\u000a      one of its water projects had been negotiated as part of a quid pro quo\u000a      linked to PWA approval of a settlement facility [C12]. The extent to which\u000a      this research has also led to changes in donor policies is more difficult\u000a      to say. [text removed for publication] Equally, in recent interviews,\u000a      donors have been uniformly unwilling to go on record expressing negative\u000a      views of the JWC [C12].\u000a      [text removed for publication]\u000a    3. [text removed for publication]\u000a    4. Challenges to international policy on water `cooperation':\u000a    International policy on trans-boundary water issues favours `cooperation\u000a      of any sort, no matter how slight', on the grounds that `cooperation' is\u000a      preferable to `conflict'. This orthodoxy has recently been subject to\u000a      extensive critique from `hydro-hegemony' researchers, who have sought to\u000a      show how water `cooperation' can function as an instrument of hegemony and\u000a      injustice. Selby's critique of `cooperation' in Israeli-Palestinian water\u000a      relations has provided the formative empirical evidence for this research\u000a      programme [C14]. In turn, hydro-hegemony research has been widely read,\u000a      and lessons from it learned, within the international water policy\u000a      community. For example, hydro-hegemony research, and Selby's work, have\u000a      influenced the thinking of the Stockholm International Water Institute\u000a      (one of the leading water policy institutes worldwide) and made it better\u000a      understand that cooperation is not a panacea or something that should be\u000a      promoted at any cost [C15].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian water conflict within\u000a      the context of the Oslo peace process.

First, the research has shown that\u000a      this conflict is much less intractable than is often claimed. The research\u000a      has critiqued pessimistic Malthusian accounts of coming `water wars', as\u000a      well as those liberal functionalist readings which see water cooperation\u000a      as a potential catalyst to peace-making. It has shown that water is\u000a      becoming less, not more, important as a source of power and conflict, and\u000a      that the Israeli-Palestinian water conflict would be solvable, were its\u000a      political context different or were other core final status issues close\u000a      to being resolved. The research has argued, in sum, for a politically and\u000a      economically contextualised approach to the Israeli-Palestinian water\u000a      conflict, and to water conflicts more generally [see e.g. Section 3, R1,\u000a      R2].\u000a    Second, and more crucially for the purpose of this case study, Selby's\u000a      research has advanced a set of critical analyses of existing\u000a      Israeli-Palestinian water relations. The 1995 Oslo II Agreement &#8212; which\u000a      transferred powers from Israel to the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the\u000a      West Bank, and remains in effect today &#8212; included lengthy provisions on\u000a      water that promised increased supplies for West Bank Palestinian\u000a      communities, and established a system of `coordinated management',\u000a      including a Joint Water Committee (JWC) with equal Israeli and Palestinian\u000a      representation. These terms were initially lauded as amongst the most\u000a      far-reaching and positive of the Oslo peace process. Selby's research\u000a      showed, however &#8212; in the first substantive critiques of these terms &#8212; that\u000a      they essentially reflected Israeli positions and interests, and were\u000a      facilitating the reproduction and extension of Israeli control over\u000a      trans-boundary water resources, as well as a worsening of the already\u000a      critical water supply situation within West Bank Palestinian communities\u000a      [e.g. R3].\u000a    Subsequently, Selby was given access to JWC negotiation archives, and\u000a      used this material to produce a systematic qualitative and quantitative\u000a      analysis of JWC processes and outcomes for 1995-2008 [R4]. Key findings of\u000a      this research were: that Israeli-Palestinian water `cooperation' has been\u000a      associated with a significant per capita decline in Palestinian water\u000a      supplies; that Israel has consistently used the JWC to veto Palestinian\u000a      water developments; that Israel has repeatedly made its approval of\u000a      Palestinian projects conditional upon simultaneous Palestinian Water\u000a      Authority (PWA) approval of water facilities for its illegal West Bank\u000a      settlements; and that the PWA &#8212; with the knowledge of PA President Abbas\u000a      and prior to him President Arafat &#8212; had approved every Israeli application\u000a      for water supply facilities for settlements, despite them being illegal\u000a      under international law, and one of the major obstacles to Palestinian\u000a      statehood. The latter finding constituted the first such evidence of the\u000a      PA lending its official consent to parts of Israel's settlement expansion\u000a      programme.\u000a    This research was all conducted by Jan Selby, initially at Lancaster and\u000a      Aberystwyth, but since January 2005 at Sussex. Since then, Selby's\u000a      research in this area has been supported by the ESRC, and the EU FP7\u000a      project Climate Change, Hydro-Conflicts and Human Security (CLICO).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43958","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"617790","Name":"Moldova"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Bradford's work on biosecurity issues has influenced state policy on\u000a      biological weapons and has become internationally known and highly\u000a      regarded by governments (a) (such as The Netherlands) and civil society\u000a      groups (b) (such as Lord Rees, Royal Society) concerned with the\u000a      maintenance and strengthening of the Biological and Toxin Weapons\u000a      Convention (BTWC).

This was a key recommendation of the Bradford\u000a      research and featured in the reports (a) presented (d) at BTWC (December\u000a      2011). Additionally, BDRC's Key Points paper published in 2012 included a\u000a      foreword from the Head of the Review Conference involving 163 states who\u000a      stated it would `inform the States' Parties preparations for the Seventh\u000a      Review Conference (a).\u000a    BDRC has brought together the knowledge generated by its research\u000a      activity and its ongoing work with BTWC to create a series of innovative\u000a      training resources for life scientists around the world. In 2009 as a\u000a      result of research with the National Defence Medical College of Japan and\u000a      the Landau Network Centro Volta of Italy, BDRC created an\u000a      easily-accessible online Education Module Resource (EMR), intended to plug\u000a      the gap in the ethical and social training provided to life scientists and\u000a      others involved in bio-technologies (e,f). There are 20 lectures that\u000a      explore the threat posed by dual-use technology in the life sciences and\u000a      present best practice for the responsible conduct of scientific research.\u000a      Each lecture with accompanying slides is available open source, free of\u000a      charge to anyone that wants to use them. Initially produced in English and\u000a      Japanese, they are now available in, Russian, French and\u000a      Romanian\/Moldovan, Spanish, Urdu, and Polish. One author (g) has produced\u000a      a book chapter devoted entirely to the value of the EMR.\u000a    In 2010, building on the initial open source resource, BDRC and its\u000a      partners launched a 12 week online Train-the-Trainer (TTP) programme to\u000a      support educators in the provision of dual-use training for their own\u000a      students and other practising scientists. This is the only University\u000a      accredited module on bioethics and biosecurity in the world. The\u000a      importance of this programme for preventing the misuse of life science\u000a      research is evidenced by the fact that, following representations from\u000a      BDRC, the Biosecurity Engagement Program (BEP) of the Office of\u000a      Cooperative Threat Reduction in the US Department of State made a policy\u000a      decision to provide a series of three grants amounting to &#163;70,000 to fund\u000a      75 bursaries for practicing life scientists to participate in the TTP. To\u000a      date, 75 life scientists from 14 different countries (e.g. Iraq,\u000a      Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Philippines, Kenya and Nigeria) have\u000a      been trained. A unique capacity-building feature of BDRC's online\u000a      train-the-trainer module is that it is a requirement that participants\u000a      utilise the EMR to demonstrate how they will assimilate dual-use\u000a      biosecurity considerations into the training of others. In accordance with\u000a      the Testimonials (g) collected by BDRC, participants that have\u000a      successfully completed the train-the-trainer course have thus incorporated\u000a      dual-use biosecurity into teaching and practice. According to one Graduate\u000a      (h): \"...I teach a course on Dual Use Education at Graduate level at\u000a        Pakistan and this material has helped a lot\" (Shinwari.Z). Another\u000a      student commented, \"I did speak to the Lagos State Chapter of the\u000a        Association of Public Health Physicians of Nigeria (APHPN) on dual use\u000a        issues. This was at a continuing professional development session held\u000a        at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (Department of Community\u000a        Health).... in Lagos. There I used my group assignment on the Thomas\u000a        Butler case to introduce them to applied ethics, dual use and other\u000a        biosecurity issues\" (Odubanjo.D) (h).\u000a    In 2011, the BRDC was funded by the UK MOD to develop another training\u000a      programme, called the National Series, which tailors the existing EMR so\u000a      that it reflects the particular issues relevant to scientists in 5\u000a      different countries (Pakistan and four Central European States). This\u000a      eliminates the need for countries to produce their own materials and to\u000a      find expert deliverers, thus increasing the opportunities for scientists\u000a      in parts of the world where bio-security is particularly pertinent, to\u000a      receive this vital training. Following a successful trial in Iraq (with 30\u000a      participants) in 2012, BEP (US Department of State) are now commissioning\u000a      BDRC staff to deliver further training in Iraq. Going forward, further\u000a      BDRC capacity-building initiatives to change the practice of life and\u000a      associated sciences through the creation of regional training hubs are\u000a      being developed with the G8 Global Partnership (i) and under United\u000a      Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI)\u000a      Project 3 and Project 18 (i) both with the potential to build capacity in\u000a      training for hundreds of scientists in different parts of the world.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at Bradford has focused on the Biological Non-Proliferation work\u000a      of the Bradford Disarmament Research Centre (BDRC).

Core\u000a      staff include Malcolm Dando (Lecturer, 1978-2010, Emeritus Professor\u000a      2010-present), Graham Pearson (Honorary Professor, 1994-present), and Dr\u000a      Simon Whitby (PDRA 1994-1999, Senior Research Fellow 2000-2011, Lecturer\u000a      and Director of BDRC 2011-present), with Doctoral and Post-Doctoral\u000a      Researchers Novossiolova and Minehata. From 1994 Dando led a research\u000a      programme on preventing biological weapons proliferation. As well as\u000a      working to strengthen the prohibition, this work focussed on the\u000a      proliferation challenges presented by developments in bio-technology. From\u000a      1996, Dando, with Pearson and Whitby, supported by funding from the Joseph\u000a      Rowntree Charitable Trust, further developed this research programme.\u000a      During this phase of the work BDRC developed a strategic approach to\u000a      maximise its impact consisting of a programme of critical but constructive\u000a      engagement to facilitate work with States Parties to the BTWC. From\u000a      2000-2008, BDRC secured a series of four Carnegie Corporation of New York\u000a      grants, amounting to approximately $1 Million (US) in total, to continue\u000a      this research.\u000a    During this phase of the work BDRC staff and associates produced eight\u000a      single authored books including references 1, 2, 3 and 4. Major insights\u000a      from this body of research revealed: that during the Twentieth Century\u000a      important States (the US, the UK, Japan and USSR) had developed\u000a      large-scale offensive biological weapons programmes for the deployment of\u000a      disease against humans, animals, and crops; that improvements in the\u000a      prohibition regime (BTWC) were essential in preventing State programmes;\u000a      that, there is a significant risk that the revolution in biology will be\u000a      applied in weapons programmes (in making, for example, genetic weapons to\u000a      target ethnic groups); and that poor biosecurity practices might lead to\u000a      accidental misuse of life science research with potentially catastrophic\u000a      consequences for industry, individual scientists and even for whole\u000a      societies. Our research findings show that it is necessary for states to\u000a      act both to formulate concrete measures to strengthen the Convention, but\u000a      also so as to stop the misuse of science, and to champion the\u000a      dissemination of best practice approaches to biosecurity amongst life- and\u000a      associated science communities (5).\u000a    Thus, supported by the above funders we began to produce a series of\u000a      reports and briefing papers on a broad range of technical issues\u000a      concerning how States might strengthen the treaty regime. In the current\u000a      REF period we have produced 11 Bradford Review Conference Papers, six\u000a      Bradford Briefing Papers on the 7th Review Conference and one Key Points\u000a      for the Seventh Review Conference Book. BDRC was one of the first security\u000a      research centres in the world to engage life- and associated- scientists\u000a      in training programmes for understanding the ethical, social and legal\u000a      implications of their work.\u000a    In 2008 BDRC, in collaboration with the National Defence Medical College,\u000a      Japan (with the Surgeon General of Japan's Air Force as PI) together with\u000a      the Landau Network Centro Volta, Italy, obtained a &#163;35,000 grant from the\u000a      British Council. The work allowed us to understand how best to incorporate\u000a      dual- use biosecurity and bioethics into the training and professional\u000a      practice of life and associated scientists (6). This understanding was\u000a      developed in 2009 when we obtained a &#163;350,000 Wellcome Trust grant. The\u000a      latter work directly resulted in the development and delivery of curricula\u000a      and international train-the- trainer courses to make life science\u000a      communities aware of dual-use bioethics and thus change their everyday\u000a      practice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44004","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Nature of the Impact:\u000a    The work of the ITPU under the terms of its framework contract with the\u000a      European Parliament has\u000a      had significant impact in stimulating and informing practitioner and\u000a      policy debate and shaping EU\u000a      policy in the area of international trade. This case study focuses on two\u000a      specific contributions:\u000a    1) Impact on the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement\u000a    In 2011 for the first time the European Parliament used the new powers\u000a      granted to it under the\u000a      Treaty of Lisbon to decide whether to approve the Free Trade Agreement\u000a      (FTA) negotiated by the\u000a      European Commission with the Republic of Korea. This agreement was not\u000a      only the most\u000a      ambitious FTA ever negotiated by the EU, and its first trade deal with an\u000a      Asian country, it also set\u000a      a precedent for EU trade policy as the first FTA adopted under the EU's\u000a      Global Europe Strategy of\u000a      2006 and for the EP's approach to its new post-Lisbon powers. The EU is\u000a      currently involved in FTA\u000a      negotiations with Japan, India, the USA, and a range of ASEAN countries.\u000a    Under the terms of the ITPU's framework contract, Dr Woolcock, leading a\u000a      number of consortium\u000a      partners, produced a comprehensive 100-page assessment of the proposed FTA\u000a      [A]. The findings\u000a      of this study were reinforced by Dr Woolcock's presentation to INTA's\u000a      public hearing in June 2010\u000a      [B]. This study found the FTA to be in the EU's broad interest. It\u000a      assessed the impact on a range of\u000a      sectors and employment and found that the terms of the agreement were on\u000a      balance positive and\u000a      that the arguments put forward by some defensive sectors in the EU\u000a      exaggerated the scope and\u000a      impact of increased Korean imports. These findings were endorsed one year\u000a      later when Woolcock\u000a      produced a further study on the application of the FTA, along with key\u000a      stakeholders, for INTA's\u000a      evaluation of the impact of the FTA in October 2012 [C].\u000a    The LSE assessment was recognised as presenting an authoritative,\u000a      balanced and independent\u000a      assessment of the proposed agreement, and was instrumental in facilitating\u000a      approval of the\u000a      agreement by the EP, despite heavy lobbying from some vested sector\u000a      interests that sought to\u000a      block the agreement. The LSE assessment was cited by the Commission in a\u000a      written answer to the\u000a      European Parliament [D] and recognised by Mr Ignacio Garcia Bercero, the\u000a      chief EU negotiator of\u000a      the agreement, as making a significant contribution to the eventual\u000a      passage of the agreement [E].\u000a    2) Impact on EU Investment Policy\u000a    Following the Lisbon Treaty's extension of exclusive European Union\u000a      competence to foreign direct\u000a      investment (FDI), the ITPU was commissioned to produce a background study\u000a      setting out the\u000a      opportunities presented by this development and the challenges that might\u000a      be faced in developing\u000a      a coherent and balanced EU approach to investment. This aspect of Lisbon\u000a      was designed to\u000a      enable the EU to conclude comprehensive trade and investment agreements,\u000a      where in the past its\u000a      coverage of investment has been only very partial, and in turn strengthen\u000a      the EU's ability to shape\u000a      international investment policy.\u000a    The ITPU study, The EU Approach To International Investment Policy\u000a        After The Lisbon Treaty [F],\u000a      supported by Dr Woolcock's oral evidence to the International Trade\u000a      Committee [G], identified four\u000a      major issues: the lack of a definition of FDI and thus the scope of EU\u000a      exclusive competence; the\u000a      need to define the main elements of an EU sustainable investment policy;\u000a      the need to decide\u000a      which third countries should be given priority in EU level investment\u000a      agreements; and the need to\u000a      agree how to manage the transition from member state bilateral investment\u000a      treaties (BITs) to EU\u000a      level investment agreements. By its nature the ITPU study required an\u000a      interdisciplinary approach\u000a      to the topic and combined international political economy and legal\u000a      analysis.\u000a    The ITPU played a significant role in framing the parameters of the\u000a      debate taking place within the\u000a      EU on the scope and nature of EU investment policy, and not just within\u000a      the INTA Committee in\u000a      the Parliament, but also elsewhere in the EP, including the European\u000a      Economic and Social\u000a      Committee [H].\u000a    Cumulative Impact\u000a    In these cases and in the other work carried out by the ITPU under the\u000a      framework contract and\u000a      underpinned by Dr Woolcock's research and that of colleagues associated\u000a      with the ITPU, LSE\u000a      research has made a significant, and often crucial, impact on the\u000a      thinking, deliberations and\u000a      ultimate decisions of the trade committee. In doing so, LSE research has\u000a      been central to ensuring\u000a      informed debate in Europe on these important issues. The LSE has also been\u000a      proactive in\u000a      proposing initiatives. This led for example to a workshop in the European\u000a      Parliament in May 2012\u000a      that brought together key stakeholders and policy-makers to discuss the\u000a      EU's position on the\u000a      proposal to use plurilateral agreements as the response to the deadlock in\u000a      multilateral trade\u000a      negotiations and the rise of emerging markets [I].\u000a    Why the Impact Matters: The EU governs the largest single market\u000a      in the world, and its trade\u000a      policies have systemic consequences for the behaviour of governments,\u000a      firms and individuals\u000a      across the world. By informing the work of INTA, Dr Stephen Woolcock's\u000a      research is helping to\u000a      ensure that those policies work effectively.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Stephen Woolcock's research on EU trade and trade policy, with\u000a      particular focus on free trade\u000a      agreements, underpins the work of the LSE's International Trade Policy\u000a      Unit (ITPU).

This\u000a      research provided some of the first comprehensive studies of non-tariff\u000a      and regulatory issues in\u000a      preferential trade agreements, with specific implications for how they\u000a      impact upon multilateral trade\u000a      and investment regimes [1, 2]. The research found that although\u000a      superficially similar there are\u000a      important differences in the approaches to preferential trade agreements\u000a      (PTAs) that have\u000a      implications for both the prospects for future reconciliation of PTAs with\u000a      multilateral trade\u000a      agreements and for the prospects of bilateral agreements, such as the\u000a      Transatlantic trade and\u000a      Investment Partnership (TTIP). Woolcock and Heydon, the authors of this\u000a      earlier comparison, have\u000a      subsequently built on their earlier work to produce a comparative study of\u000a      EU and US approaches\u000a      to PTAs to inform the debate within the European Parliament and beyond\u000a      [3]. With regard to\u000a      European Union trade policy Woolcock has maintained an established\u000a      position in the field and\u000a      produced the first comprehensive treatment of the conduct of European\u000a      Union economic\u000a      diplomacy [4; see also 5 and 6].\u000a    As a result of this research base, Dr Woolcock and the ITPU were\u000a      successful in bidding for a\u000a      framework contract to provide expert analysis for the International Trade\u000a      Policy Committee of the\u000a      European Parliament. Under this framework contract, which provides for a\u000a      total of &#8364;600,000 over a\u000a      four year period from December 2009, the ITPU coordinates a consortium of\u000a      research institutions\u000a      across the European Union that has to date produced a total of 32 studies\u000a      and workshops and\u000a      drawn down some &#8364;370,000 from the total funds available. The ITPU has\u000a      delivered or is in the\u000a      process of conducting research studies on no fewer than fourteen specific\u000a      policy areas, of which\u000a      two are highlighted in this case study. The ITPU is also leading a bid for\u000a      a further four-year\u000a      framework contract worth another &#8364;650,000 for the period 2014-2018.\u000a    Key Researcher: Dr Woolcock has been employed full-time at LSE\u000a      since 1998.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44200","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our impact is not about a linear thread between outputs and outcomes, but\u000a      an iterative and cumulative influence on ways of recognising agency for\u000a      change, the importance of community participation and voice in decision\u000a      making and community resilience against external provocations. ICPS\u000a      research has combined with the PPC's innovative knowledge exchange and\u000a      peace-building practices, thus enhancing impact. The partnerships we have\u000a      built with formal and informal community organisations and individual\u000a      activists (e.g. Schools Linking Network, Tenants Federation, All Keighley\u000a      Communities Together, Diversity Exchange, Manningham Sports Centre\u000a      Coaching Group; Democratise the Mosque Group) statutory bodies (eg Police,\u000a      Youth Service); Council Officers and others, have generated relationships\u000a      which have facilitated receptivity to our research messages and new\u000a      thinking and practice amongst these actors around community participation\u000a      and responses to threats of urban conflict.\u000a    Building Community Voice\u000a    Working with community researchers has enabled activists and residents in\u000a      communities not only to gain new skills but to be heard by decision makers\u000a      (a). The importance of this message was recognised by JRF which\u000a      commissioned a local playwright to write and direct a play from the\u000a      research (b). This was performed three times in Bradford in 2010 to local\u000a      residents and policy makers followed by discussion on stage between them,\u000a      and once in Birmingham in 2011 as JRF rolled out work on `white estates'.\u000a      A long term partnership was formed from this research with activists from\u000a      Braithwaite Estate trying to reactivate the District Tenants Federation.\u000a      Our AHRC funded research on Power in Community was used by the latter to\u000a      stimulate discussion on power, and in July 2013 the theme of power in\u000a      community was the focus of their reactivation conference for which\u000a      Professor Pearce was the keynote speaker. The leading activist in this\u000a      effort is now a member of the Community University Council and two other\u000a      housing activists are participants in the Community University. This work\u000a      on community voice fed into the regional Yorkshire and Humber Empowerment\u000a      Partnership,a network bringing together around 50 community groups, to a\u000a      role of `reflecting back' on community presentations to a regional\u000a      Empowerment Commission in 2008 and to an invitation to write the forward\u000a      to the collected essays on the Partnership's work (d).\u000a    Thinkspace and the Community University: Fostering New Learning and\u000a        Practice\u000a    The ICPS and PPC have worked together on knowledge exchange spaces for\u000a      many years (11 `Thinkspaces' held between 2009 and 2013) where academics\u000a      and practitioners share thinking and practice about dialogue,\u000a      participation and peace-building, underpinned by the REAP approach to\u000a      University-Community Engagement (c) and commissioned research on dialogue\u000a      (d, e). Interviews with Schools Linking Network (an innovative project to\u000a      connect Bradford's `segregated' schools, now rolled out nationally which\u000a      supports young people, schools and local authorities in exploring\u000a      identity, diversity and equality in communities) and Council Officers\u000a      evidence this impact (d). The philosophy and methodology of co-producing\u000a      knowledge encourages partnerships; for instance it brought 16 community\u000a      participants in the Power in Community Project to a feedback session in\u000a      February 2012. The idea of the Community University was born there; a\u000a      successful partnership around a co-designed proposal led to ESRC\/JRF\u000a      funding and Comm-Uni-ty was launched with a Kickstarter Day in July 2013,\u000a      bringing community activists from `white' estates, the inner city Muslim\u000a      communities, and more professional backgrounds together with academics to\u000a      co-construct a space for learning about power and participation (f).\u000a      Rarely does such a mix of Bradford citizens work together on new learning.\u000a      The idea of building a `Community University' has potential significance\u000a      beyond Bradford; activists, academics and policy thinkers outside the\u000a      District have been invited to act as friends and associates to facilitate\u000a      this wider impact.\u000a    Addressing Urban Conflict, Building Peace and Resilience: Responses to\u000a        the EDL Protests in Bradford District (2010, 2012 and 2013)\u000a    In 2010 the PPC undertook a series of peace-building interventions when\u000a      Bradford faced the English Defence League, which included the largest\u000a      policing operation in a city since WWII. This drew on learning from the\u000a      2001 riots research (b), and built on long term work with the Bradford\u000a      police including an exchange programme with the community police in\u000a      Medellin, Latin America (2002-2006) (g,h).The PPC participated in over 20\u000a      discussions between activists, the Council and Police which led to a\u000a      successful channel of communications on the day and a series of practical\u000a      agreements. The PPC also negotiated the use of `street mediators'. The PPC\u000a      recruited, informally trained and facilitated the `Stop It Kicking Off\u000a      Network. This led to the request to the ICPS to evaluate Bradford's\u000a      response. A feedback session of the draft report brought together over 40\u000a      people at all levels of activism and policy making in the District\u000a      (including the Chief Executive) in December 2011. The value of the report\u000a      was formally recognised by the police (h) and the ICPS\/PPC can claim that\u000a      they have helped change the culture of policing potential unrest in\u000a      Bradford, securing institutional support for grassroots peacekeeping and\u000a      encouraging inner city youths to see themselves as part of resilience\u000a      efforts. The PPC disseminated the evaluation research via Thinkspace in a\u000a      workshop attended by 20 people, further enhancing the impact on\u000a      practitioner thinking. The report secured acceptance of street mediators\u000a      with real influence, leading to the PPC's `Stop it Kicking Off Model'\u000a      being used in a regional EDL demonstration in Keighley in 2012 and in\u000a      Bradford 2013. Council Officers recognised the report's role in `cascading\u000a      learning' (e). The research has national significance, evidenced by\u000a      requests from the CEO of Croydon Council to share the report with senior\u000a      Council and police officers (i), and the invitation to the PPC officer to\u000a      be a Director of a national consortia of Far Right specialists, known as\u000a      Concilio.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since the Bradford Riots in 2001, research at Bradford has helped to\u000a      defuse underlying tensions between deprived, multiethnic communities and\u000a      between them and the local state thus strengthening community resilience\u000a      in the city.

In 2000, the\u000a      intellectual and practical relevance of this research from the global\u000a      South to social change amongst poor, multi-ethnic communities in a\u000a      de-industrialised Northern city (Bradford) was recognised with the\u000a      appointment of Jenny Pearce (Lecturer 1993-1995, Reader 1995-1999,\u000a      Professor 1999-present) to a commission under Sir Herman Ouseley to\u000a      explore community fragmentation in Bradford District. Pearce founded the\u000a      Programme for a Peaceful City (PPC) in 2001 to channel research to the\u000a      community, create `safe space' for dialogue, build partnerships and\u000a      enhance research impact. The International Centre for Participation\u000a      Studies (ICPS) was established in 2004 as a research hub for Global South\u000a      North learning, participatory social action and co-production of knowledge\u000a      with community and institutional partners.\u000a    The members of the research and action ICPS team include: Deputy\u000a      Director, Dr Graeme Chesters (Senior Research Fellow 2005-present) who has\u000a      critical theorising of non-state social action to the theory-practice\u000a      experimentation of the ICPS; Dr Ute Kelly (Research Assistant 2000-2004,\u000a      Lecturer 2004-present) has conceptual and practical interest in dialogue\u000a      and deliberation; Heather Blakey (Research Fellow 2004-2008) focussed on\u000a      participatory budgeting; Lisa Cumming (Programme Officer 2003-2005,\u000a      Community Associate 2005-present) has expertise in facilitation and\u000a      dialogue and bridges the academic-practitioner divide.\u000a    Throughout the life of the ICPS\/PPC, the interface between research and\u000a      practice has been central. This methodology is highlighted in the REAP\u000a      (Reciprocity, Externalities, Access and Partnership) approach to\u000a      university-community engagement (2), a piece of commissioned research to\u000a      measure such engagement and which sees the community as participant not\u000a      recipient in a reciprocal relationship with the University. By\u000a      experimenting with different process methods (e.g. community researchers;\u000a      co-produced research), we have built connections to a range of community\u000a      groups (3,4).This enabled us to create a feedback loop between the\u000a      university, the community, statutory and council bodies, aimed at\u000a      enhancing community voice. This innovative cycle of `practice, reflection,\u000a      practice' was implemented through co-producing knowledge with community\u000a      activists in three Latin American and three UK cities for ESRC funded\u000a      project on municipal innovation in non-governmental public action\u000a      2008-2010 (3); working with community researchers on Bradford's white\u000a      estates on community participation (4); working with young Asian\u000a      auxiliaries for research on the Bradford riot (5) and `Power Talks' with\u000a      community activists (6). These approaches have built trust with research\u000a      participants, enhancing credibility with policy makers, demonstrated in\u000a      our contribution to community resilience against provocations from the EDL\u000a      2010, 2012 and 2013.\u000a    The key messages from the underpinning research are that community and\u000a      grass roots based organisations and movements generate knowledge for\u000a      change, which can influence the effectiveness of policy, extend its reach\u000a      and widen citizen participation. For community agency for change to be\u000a      unleashed, institutions need to reflect differently on their relationships\u000a      with citizens and the way horizontal relationships, rather than\u000a      traditional top down policy processes, can improve their knowledge base\u000a      and practice. The ICPS has disseminated these messages through our\u000a      participatory methods and feedback processes, based on a strong foundation\u000a      of funded research (over &#163;500,000 of grant funding) in the locality,\u000a      including grants from the major Research Councils (AHRC\/ESRC) and the\u000a      leading UK research funder on poverty (JRF). While this research emerges\u000a      in the locality, we argue, it has significance nationally and even\u000a      globally to tackling poverty, exclusion and conflict.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44385","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    (1) EC officials and humanitarian aid agency representatives based\u000d\u000a        their discussion of EU and humanitarian policy options in Syria and\u000d\u000a        their ultimate recommendations to UN officials in Geneva on the findings\u000d\u000a        of a policy options paper prepared by Hollis. In addition, senior UK\u000d\u000a        military planners incorporated Hollis's findings in contingency planning\u000d\u000a        (April 2012; April 2013) following her invited participation in\u000d\u000a        brainstorming sessions. The fact that the EU Institute for Security\u000d\u000a      Studies (EUISS) and the UK military asked Hollis to contribute to their\u000d\u000a      deliberations derived in part from their acquaitance with her work through\u000d\u000a      her prior participation in the deliberations of these bodies and\u000d\u000a      decision-makers. Specifically, between 2008 and 2012 she contributed to\u000d\u000a      several policy workshops and publications of the EUISS in Paris; presented\u000d\u000a      research findings to military service personnel on a series of Ministry of\u000d\u000a      Defence short courses on the Middle East run by The Department for Peace\u000d\u000a      Studies at Bradford University; and served on a six-person international\u000d\u000a      support team helping a group of European elder statesmen\/women, led by\u000d\u000a      Lord Patten and former French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, to develop\u000d\u000a      policy initiatives for the EU regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u000d\u000a      It was on the basis of this track record and access that Hollis was\u000d\u000a      invited by the Director of the EUISS in late 2011 to formulate a policy\u000d\u000a      options paper for humanitarian intervention in Syria, commissioned for the\u000d\u000a      EC. Her paper outlined three scenarios for the Syria crisis and their\u000d\u000a      implications. The EUISS then used those scenarios to frame a discussion\u000d\u000a      with EC officials and humanitarian agency staff in Paris on 20th\u000d\u000a      February 2012. The findings of that discussion were then used as the basis\u000d\u000a      for a follow-up discussion with UN officials in Geneva, which in turn fed\u000d\u000a      into the UN initiative headed by Kofi Annan to seek a diplomatic solution\u000d\u000a      to the Syria crisis. The impact of Hollis's work was in informing the\u000d\u000a      discussion about scenarios and thence contingencies and possibilities. In\u000d\u000a      a similar vein, when the UK military was engaged in developing contingency\u000d\u000a      plans for military and\/or humanitarian intervention in Syria (2012-2013)\u000d\u000a      Hollis was one of five UK academics with Middle East expertise to\u000d\u000a      participate in two brainstorming sessions of senior British military\u000d\u000a      personnel in April 2012 and April 2013 specifically to provide input on\u000d\u000a      the likely regional repercussions of such intervention.\u000d\u000a    (2) Research findings expanded UK-Turkish dialogue and contributed to\u000d\u000a        the success of a key forum (Tatlidil, Istanbul,\u000d\u000a        October 2012) aimed at deepening bilateral relations between the two\u000d\u000a        countries. For the purpose of developing a closer bilateral\u000d\u000a      UK-Turkey relationship, senior parliamentarians, led by Jack Straw on the\u000d\u000a      UK side, set up a Forum called the Tatlidil, which first met at\u000d\u000a      Ditchley Park in October 2011. Hollis was one of the invited participants\u000d\u000a      and during that meeting she learned that the Turkish delegation would have\u000d\u000a      liked more input about UK policy in the Middle East to parallel their\u000d\u000a      input on Turkish policy. Consequently, at the second meeting of the Tatlidil\u000d\u000a      (12-14 October 2012 in Istanbul) Hollis presented a summation of her\u000d\u000a      research findings on the British response to the Arab uprisings which\u000d\u000a      served as a counterpart to a parallel Turkish policy presentation. This\u000d\u000a      prompted a lively debate about UK actions, choices and lessons learned\u000d\u000a      which was pronounced by participants the most vigorous and engaging\u000d\u000a      discussion of the whole Forum. Hollis was commended (among others) for her\u000d\u000a      input by former UK Ambassador to Turkey Sir David Logan and Labour Shadow\u000d\u000a      Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander. She helped to expand and progress the\u000d\u000a      bilateral dialogue and with it bilateral relations. The Turkish Ambassador\u000d\u000a      to the UK attested to this when he specifically asked Hollis to be sure to\u000d\u000a      save the dates of the 3rd Tatlidil (November 2013) so\u000d\u000a      that she could again be present.\u000d\u000a    (3) The 2013 Foreign Policy Report of the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth\u000d\u000a      Office (FCO) on the `Balance of Competences' between UK and EU was\u000d\u000a      substantiated with evidence from Hollis' research. In 2012 the UK\u000d\u000a      Government began preparation of its `Balance of Competences' review to\u000d\u000a      inform debate and thence decision-making on UK membership of the EU.\u000d\u000a      Hollis was one of the individuals invited by the FCO (7th\u000d\u000a      December 2012) to submit evidence to inform the part of the review devoted\u000d\u000a      to foreign policy and to participate in a preparatory consultation at the\u000d\u000a      FCO on 16th January 2013. Hollis made several inteventions at\u000d\u000a      the consultation meeting to clarify the questions that the FCO wished her\u000d\u000a      to address in the evidence submitted. The evidence she subsequently\u000d\u000a      submitted drew directly on research undertaken on the substance and impact\u000d\u000a      of UK and EU policies in the Mediterranean neighbourhood. This evidence\u000d\u000a      was quoted four times in the Review of the Balance of Competences\u000d\u000a        between the United Kingdom and the European Union Foreign Policy\u000d\u000a      (July 2013, pages 45, 46 and 47) in its Case Study on the `Arab Spring'.\u000d\u000a      It served to substantiate the argument advanced there that the EU has\u000d\u000a      added value to the pursuit of UK policy and interests. Of the 64\u000d\u000a      `Academics, Thinktankers and Other Individuals' who submitted evidence for\u000d\u000a      this report, 13 were academics, representing ten UK universities (with two\u000d\u000a      each from the Universities of Oxford, Birmingham and City University\u000d\u000a      London). Hollis and Professor Alan Riley (The City Law School) were City's\u000d\u000a      two contributors.\u000d\u000a    Regarding UK policy in response to the Arab Spring (2010-2012), the FCO\u000d\u000a      and Department for International Development (DFID) have set up an\u000d\u000a      Advisory Group to provide feedback on their Arab Partnership Initiative.\u000d\u000a      In June 2012 Hollis was invited to serve on the Arab Partnership Advisory\u000d\u000a      Group. Her contributions to the biannual meetings of this group (at the\u000d\u000a      FCO) have drawn directly on her research on UK and wider EU initatives to\u000d\u000a      promote reform in the `Arab Spring' countries. This work has informed the\u000d\u000a      government assessments of the value and limitations of what their\u000d\u000a      partnership can achieve.\u000d\u000a    (4) Research informed and shaped media coverage and civil society debate\u000d\u000a      about Arab uprisings during the period 2009-2012. Hollis is frequently\u000d\u000a      invited to give expert analysis on broadcast media on the basis of her\u000d\u000a      research and expert reputation. Between 2011 and 2013 she presented her\u000d\u000a      analysis and offered commentary on BBC Radio 4 (The Today Programme,\u000d\u000a        Start the Week, Any Questions), the BBC News Channel, Sky News, the\u000d\u000a      BBC World Service, Al Jazeera, Voice of Russia Radio and TV, Radio France\u000d\u000a      International, LBC, BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Radio Wales; RTE (Ireland),\u000d\u000a      British Forces Broadcasting (BFBS), CNN, CNBC, CBC (Canada), Austrian\u000d\u000a      Radio, ABC (Australia), and National Public Radio (USA). She received 855\u000d\u000a      mentions in the media between December 2010 and December 2012. Foreign\u000d\u000a      Office Minister Alastair Burt was prompted to invite Hollis to join a\u000d\u000a      group of specialists for a brainstorming about the implications for\u000d\u000a      Britain of the Arab uprisings on 8th February 2011 as a result\u000d\u000a      of having heard her comment on The Today Programme. Hollis's\u000d\u000a      contributions to media output have contributed to a wider public\u000d\u000a      understanding of and engagement with her areas of research expertise,\u000d\u000a      including the Middle East and the Syrian conflict.\u000d\u000a    Hollis has also been requested to provide commentary for The\u000d\u000a        Huffington Post, The International Herald Tribune, The\u000d\u000a        Guardian, The Sunday Times, LA Times and Reuters.\u000d\u000a      Hollis also gave a number of public lectures and talks to general\u000d\u000a      audiences outside academia, including school groups, civil society\u000d\u000a      activist groups and participants in current affairs meetings for\u000d\u000a      non-academics.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    (1) European Commission officials and humanitarian aid agency\u000d\u000a      representatives based their discussion of European Union (EU) and\u000d\u000a      humanitarian policy options in Syria and their ultimate recommendations to\u000d\u000a      United Nations officials in Geneva on the findings of a policy options\u000d\u000a      paper prepared by Professor Rosemary Hollis of City University London.

Since her appointment at\u000d\u000a      City in March 2008 Hollis has pursued three interconnected lines of\u000d\u000a      research on (a) contemporary UK policy in the Middle East; (b) EU policies\u000d\u000a      in the Mediterranean and the wider Middle East including Iran; and (c)\u000d\u000a      international engagement in the quest for resolution of the\u000d\u000a      Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In all cases Hollis's research has combined\u000d\u000a      analysis of UK, EU and US policies with work on the drivers of political\u000d\u000a      change and conflict in the Middle East. Hollis's research has also\u000d\u000a      benefited from informal collaboration with other staff in the Department\u000d\u000a      (Aran, Collantes-Celadore, Silvestri); other colleagues at City in the\u000d\u000a      Department of Journalism, The City Law School, Cass Business School, the\u000d\u000a      Department of Psychology and the University Counselling Service; and\u000d\u000a      colleagues at the Universities of Durham, Bradford, St Andrews, Cambridge,\u000d\u000a      Exeter, Queen's University Belfast and King's College London.\u000d\u000a    Key findings of this research which specifically underpin the\u000d\u000a      impact achieved include:\u000d\u000a    1. Contemporary developments in the Middle East can be best understood as\u000d\u000a      the latest phase in an evolution which dates back to the creation of the\u000d\u000a      Arab state system and drawing of borders (largely by Britain and France)\u000d\u000a      in the immediate aftermath of the First World War and collapse of the\u000d\u000a      Ottoman Empire. That system meant that dictatorial regimes (challenged\u000d\u000a      recently in the `Arab Spring') emerged at the expense of democracy and\u000d\u000a      human security in the region.\u000d\u000a    2. Since the mid-twentieth century Western policy-makers have generally\u000d\u000a      given precedence to establishing working relationships with dictatorial\u000d\u000a      Arab regimes rather than challenging them about their human rights record\u000d\u000a      or failure to promote democracy. After 9\/11 in particular, security and\u000d\u000a      intelligence cooperation with such regimes took precedence over democracy\u000d\u000a      promotion, even though the US, Britain and the EU launched initiatives and\u000d\u000a      programmes with the latter goal during the 1990s and 2000s.\u000d\u000a    3. Policy-makers can be trapped in a `mindset' that may be informed by\u000d\u000a      accurate information initially but atrophies over time and is rarely\u000d\u000a      revisited or reconsidered. Thus British (and US) policy-makers dealing\u000d\u000a      with President Mubarak of Egypt in the years immediately prior to his\u000d\u000a      ousting in 2011 became convinced that he was a fixture and `useful' and\u000d\u000a      were blinded to his vulnerability.\u000d\u000a    4. Britain's New Labour governments allowed policy presentation to take\u000d\u000a      precedence over content. By associating Britain with the promotion of\u000d\u000a      `values' such as democracy and human rights, the Government sought to\u000d\u000a      maximise British influence overseas under the rubric of `making Britain a\u000d\u000a      force for good in the world'. Yet miscalculation and inadequate capacity\u000d\u000a      to deliver on UK objectives in specific contexts, notably in Iraq, damaged\u000d\u000a      Britain's reputation, led to accusations of hubris and failed to disguise\u000d\u000a      the Government's associations with some Arab dictators.\u000d\u000a    5. The focus of UK foreign policy shifted from a regions-based approach\u000d\u000a      to one which sought to maximise British influence in key power centres\u000d\u000a      (including Washington, the EU, the International Monetary Fund, the G8 and\u000d\u000a      NATO). After 9\/11 the emphasis changed from making Britain a `force for\u000d\u000a      good in the world' to combatting `evil', by which was meant, essentially,\u000d\u000a      Islamist-inspired terrorism. In response to the Arab uprisings, there was\u000d\u000a      a further recalibration of policy, this time to `partner' with Arab civil\u000d\u000a      society groups seeking democracy. It proved to be too little, too late to\u000d\u000a      reverse Britain's declining unilateral influence and impact.\u000d\u000a    6. EU policy initiatives in the Mediterranean are framed to `export\u000d\u000a      European values' to neighbouring countries, thereby prompting resistance\u000d\u000a      on the receiving end. Meanwhile, EU measures to combat terrorism and\u000d\u000a      control migration rely on the cooperation of the very dictatorships they\u000d\u000a      purport to want to change.\u000d\u000a    7. On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict the EU approach has ameliorated\u000d\u000a      the impact of continued occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza\u000d\u000a      but in so doing it has perpetuated, rather than ended, both. Declaratory\u000d\u000a      statements about what the parties to the conflict should do have\u000d\u000a      taken the place of strategies to effect change.\u000d\u000a    The research that produced the above findings involved individual\u000d\u000a      investigation of documentary and media sources covering a 20 year period;\u000d\u000a      interviews with decision-makers and practitioners; and participation in\u000d\u000a      numerous workshops with fellow academics, politicians, business and the\u000d\u000a      military in Brussels, Paris, Berlin, London, Washington, Istanbul, various\u000d\u000a      Arab states, Israel and the Palestinian Territories.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44386","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1227603","Name":"Sri Lanka"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Improving Quality of Country Information and Public Debate in Asylum\u000a        Decision-Making: Dr\u000a      McDowell's research on conflict and asylum-migration (the latter term,\u000a      coined by him, recognises\u000a      that asylum movements often follow similar patterns to economic migration\u000a      in decision-making,\u000a      routes, use of agents and destination countries) has addressed the asylum\u000a      process in the UK,\u000a      Europe and Australia as well as return and settlement strategies and\u000a      asylum diaspora politics. His\u000a      reputation as an expert in this area along with his role at ICAR, which\u000a      became the UK's leading\u000a      provider of authoritative information on asylum, led to Dr McDowell\u000a      providing academic oversight of\u000a      research undertaken by the Asylum and Destitution Working Group of the UK\u000a      Centre for Social\u000a      Justice and by the Independent Asylum Commission which reviewed the UK\u000a      asylum system\u000a      between October 2006 and July 2008.\u000a    He also received a Ministerial invitation to sit on the UK Home Office\u000a      Advisory Group on Country\u000a      Information (the IAGCI, subsequently advisory to the Independent Chief\u000a      Inspector of the UK Border\u000a      Agency). Following two re-invitations, he has served on the IAGCI since\u000a      2007 until now and has\u000a      applied his research knowledge and country expertise on Sri Lanka (a\u000a      country that has generated\u000a      significant numbers of displaced people) to improving the quality,\u000a      timeliness, accuracy and\u000a      comprehensiveness of human rights information available to decision-makers\u000a      in the UK Home\u000a      Office Asylum Division.

The UK Border Agency has recognised\u000a      that the significant\u000a      improvement in its reports over several years is in large part a result of\u000a      the work of the IAGCI. The\u000a      UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which is represented on the Group, has\u000a      congratulated the\u000a      Independent Chief Inspector on the successes of the IAGCI, most notably\u000a      the improvements in\u000a      decision quality and fairness of asylum application outcomes.\u000a    The main beneficiaries of these activities are the Chief Inspector of the\u000a      UK Border Agency, the UK\u000a      Home Office, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the\u000a      European Union's\u000a      European Asylum Support Office (EASO), asylum case-workers making use of\u000a      better Country\u000a      Information and asylum applicants (as a result of improved information\u000a      guiding decisions on their\u000a      cases).\u000a    McDowell's research on media reporting on asylum was cited widely in\u000a      submissions to the\u000a      Leveson Inquiry into the Culture Practice and Ethics of the Press during\u000a      2011 and 2012. It had\u000a      earlier influenced the Mayor of London to initiate annual awards for press\u000a      reporting on asylum and\u000a      refugees which ran until 2008.\u000a    Improving Accountability and `Safeguards' in Involuntary Resettlement:\u000a      Dr McDowell's\u000a      expertise on development-created displacement and involuntary resettlement\u000a      has resulted in a\u000a      series of senior advisory assignments with the major international\u000a      organisations engaged in\u000a      resettlement policy and practice. Earlier roles included preparing\u000a      strategy options for the\u000a      International Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Geneva to\u000a      incorporate the dynamic of\u000a      non-conflict displacement into its international advocacy and information\u000a      work; and acting as the\u000a      Senior International Resettlement Specialist on the Asian Development\u000a      Bank's Technical\u000a      Assistance missions in China, India and Cambodia, advising governments on\u000a      policies for\u000a      impoverishment risk management in the resettlement process. They led to Dr\u000a      McDowell acting as\u000a      Social and Resettlement Expert on the World Bank Inspection Panel\u000a      investigation into the\u000a      KwaBenya Urban Environmental Sanitation Project in Ghana during 2009 and\u000a      2010. The\u000a      Inspection Panel is an independent complaints mechanism for people who\u000a      believe they have been,\u000a      or are likely to be, adversely affected by a World Bank-funded project.\u000a    The request for inspection in this case was based on a contention that a\u000a      highly-controversial,\u000a      multimillion dollar project for a proposed sanitary landfill site would\u000a      result in negative pollution and\u000a      health impacts and would displace residents and artisans working in the\u000a      affected valley and its\u000a      surroundings. As a Panel member, Dr McDowell participated in the\u000a      inspection and advised on\u000a      social and resettlement aspects of the project in Accra, Ghana. Within\u000a      this role he undertook\u000a      investigative research that was fundamental to the Panel's fact-finding\u000a      efforts and ultimate findings\u000a      on issues of policy compliance and harm to the affected community. The\u000a      World Bank accepted the\u000a      Panel's findings that both the pre-construction impact studies and\u000a      community consultations with\u000a      residents were insufficient and froze the project loan, thus enabling time\u000a      for full consultations and\u000a      impact assessments. The investigation resulted in an important new Bank\u000a      requirement that\u000a      comprehensive Zone of Impact Assessments are undertaken in all future\u000a      projects as part of loan\u000a      preparations.\u000a    His research findings have contributed to the strengthening of national\u000a      and international\u000a      governance through adoption of national resettlement laws and improved\u000a      Technical Directives and\u000a      Policies. Beneficiaries also included the immediate population most\u000a      affected by the proposed\u000a      landfill site in Ghana.\u000a    In 2010 Dr McDowell was commissioned to carry out a study on involuntary\u000a      resettlement and\u000a      climate change for the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser's Foresight\u000a      Programme\u000a      (Department of Business, Industry and Skills) which was published in 2011.\u000a      The One Year Review\u000a      of the Global Environmental Migration Programme for which the paper was\u000a      commissioned\u000a      described the Programme as having \"significant impact with UK and\u000a        international stakeholders.

They\u000a      included an examination of the impact of dispersed asylum seekers in towns\u000a      in the UK Midlands,\u000a      the provision of legal advice to failed asylum seekers in detention, media\u000a      reporting on asylum in\u000a      the UK press and public attitudes towards asylum.

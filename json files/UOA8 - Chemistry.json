The Kent\u000d\u000a      research was conducted in close collaboration with the Healthcare Division\u000d\u000a      of Royal Philips Electronics at Hamburg, Germany using their experimental\u000d\u000a      medical imaging platforms for small mammals. It led to the signature of a\u000d\u000a      joint accord between Phillips and EryDel relating to the development and\u000d\u000a      exploitation of the processes and materials involved. These processes and\u000d\u000a      materials are unique, covered by international patents, and possess the\u000d\u000a      potential to significantly impact a global market estimated to be worth in\u000d\u000a      excess of &#8364;11 billion by 2015. Together, Royal Philips Electronics and\u000d\u000a      EryDel are actively pursuing the commercial development and exploitation\u000d\u000a      of the materials and processes involved. As a consequence of this work and\u000d\u000a      optimisation of the erythroctye encapsulation process, the company has\u000d\u000a      developed the erythrocyte ghost system into a platform for drug delivery.\u000d\u000a      It has successfully concluded the Phase II Proof of Concept Study \"Evaluation\u000d\u000a        of Effects of Intra-Erythrocyte Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate (EryDex)\u000d\u000a        on Neurological Symptoms in Ataxia- Teleangectasia (A-T) Patients\",\u000d\u000a      EudraCT Number 2010-022315-19 and has just announced (June 2013) that the\u000d\u000a      European Medicinal Agency has approved\u000d\u000a        Orphan Drug Designation for EryDex for the treatment of Ataxia\u000d\u000a      Telangiectasia.

This has allowed Hilger to expand its market and\u000d\u000a      seek customers in high-end applications of X-ray imaging such as air\u000d\u000a      transport and sea cargo screening and medical diagnostic devices.\u000d\u000a    Despite the disadvantages detailed above the rare-earth doped crystals\u000d\u000a      are also of interest for some specialist applications.\u000d\u000a    As a result of the new product, derived from the collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      University, the company has recruited new staff, including one new\u000d\u000a      research scientist as well as other high-quality technical staff &#8212; a key\u000d\u000a      requirement for future growth.\u000d\u000a    The new material enables great market penetration for high-performance\u000d\u000a      end sales to X-ray imaging companies throughout the world. All of the\u000d\u000a      company's current customers are located outside the UK. Hence, all sales\u000d\u000a      are export sales, mostly to the USA. The new material increased the annual\u000d\u000a      sales turnover by c.&#163;45k the first year it was launched in 2012 and is\u000d\u000a      projected (based on past experience, by the company) to improve the annual\u000d\u000a      sales turnover in the next three years' time to &#163;250k, which corresponds\u000d\u000a      to about 35% of the company's annual export volume.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a   Detectors and Imaging Arrays Cs(Tl)I from the Hilger Crystals Website.\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.hilger-crystals.co.uk\/prior\/detectors.htm\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    A positive effect on the reputation and advertisement of Hilger Crystals\u000d\u000a      Ltd, resulted in the company being acquired by one of their largest\u000d\u000a      competitors in 2010, becoming a partner of the Dynasil group, which\u000d\u000a      specialises in advanced materials for a broad range of applications, with\u000d\u000a      markets in the medical, industrial, defence, as well as the homeland\u000d\u000a      security, sectors. This occurred while the product described in this case\u000d\u000a      study was under development and hence the potential future profits from\u000d\u000a      this product will have contributed to Hilger's attractiveness to Dynasil.\u000d\u000a    Hilger Crystals grow crystals for other companies to use in x-ray\u000d\u000a      scanners and other devices. These are sold into, and employed in, the\u000d\u000a      security and medical industries.

Chadwick [Kent 1970-present] and G.

This case\u000d\u000a      study describes one successful project that has arisen from this\u000d\u000a      collaboration. Not all of the research described here was published in the\u000d\u000a      academic literature for reasons of confidentiality. Publication [1] is\u000d\u000a      directly relevant to this proposal, Publications [2,3] describe\u000d\u000a      underpinning technique development pioneered by Kent staff, that was later\u000d\u000a      employed in this case. Theoretical work performed by Kent staff (M.\u000d\u000a      Alfredsson [Kent lecturer 2007-present]) was also key to the success of\u000d\u000a      this project. The SPS contribution can be verified by Hilger Crystals\u000d\u000a      [5.1].\u000d\u000a    There is a large worldwide market in scintillator materials for X-ray\u000d\u000a      scanners. However, images produced during scanning are blurred due to an\u000d\u000a      electronic process known as `afterglow'. Understanding the origin of the\u000d\u000a      afterglow in scintillators allows for the production of novel materials\u000d\u000a      with improved properties, resulting in sharper images.\u000d\u000a    The objectives of the collaboration between Hilger Crystals Ltd (Hilger)\u000d\u000a      and the School of Physical Sciences (SPS) were to:\u000d\u000a    (i) establish the origin of the afterglow process in Thallium-doped\u000d\u000a      Caesium Iodide (Tl,Cs)I scintillator single crystals;\u000d\u000a    (ii) develop an industrial process in which high-quality crystals could\u000d\u000a      be grown reliably, with significantly reduced afterglow, using standard\u000d\u000a      commercial materials;\u000d\u000a    (iii) investigate co-doping with rare-earth elements[1] to establish\u000d\u000a      whether these elements are critical for the afterglow reduction in\u000d\u000a      (Tl,Cs)I.\u000d\u000a    (i) Origin of the afterglow process.\u000d\u000a    It is generally accepted that the afterglow is caused by trapping of the\u000d\u000a      carriers that re-combine with the excited defect centres. The theoretical\u000d\u000a      work led by Alfredsson proposed unusual behaviour of the Cs-I interactions\u000d\u000a      in the system. Contrary to the general observation that band gaps decrease\u000d\u000a      with increasing pressure it was found that the band gap in CsI increases\u000d\u000a      if pressure or stress is applied. This was originally explained as a\u000d\u000a      relativistic effect in the material, but our simulations showed this be a\u000d\u000a      hybridisation effect. The observation is important in the understanding of\u000d\u000a      the origin to the afterglow, as the relaxation time of the material is\u000d\u000a      crucial for low afterglow. Thallium doping reduces the band gap\u000d\u000a      significantly, but the band gap behaviour remains. Understanding and\u000d\u000a      controlling this behaviour decreases the afterglow in the material\u000d\u000a    (ii) Reliable growth of high quality crystals.\u000d\u000a    New scaled-up crystal growth techniques were investigated at Hilger.\u000d\u000a      These were performed in collaboration with, and guided by Density\u000d\u000a      Functional Theory simulations and a number of material characterisation\u000d\u000a      experiments (e.g. IR, TGA, XRD and SEM-EDX) undertaken at SPS. The\u000d\u000a      quality of the crystal was found to be critically dependent on crystal\u000d\u000a      growth parameters, particularly temperature gradient and soaking times:\u000d\u000a      these were optimised. Processing of the final material, including heat\u000d\u000a      treatment and storage time, were found to reduce the afterglow, as the\u000d\u000a      material is allowed to relax after processing. Allowing the material to\u000d\u000a      relax means storage costs for the company. The result was a new crystal\u000d\u000a      growth method that yields new types of (TlCs)I crystals with substantially\u000d\u000a      fewer defects. These crystals are much clearer and more reproducible than\u000d\u000a      previously, and have dramatically reduced afterglow.\u000d\u000a    (iii) Co-doping with rare-earth elements.\u000d\u000a    Rare-earth doped CsI single crystals were initially grown at the SPS and\u000d\u000a      Hilger. In 2006 Blacklocks (Ph.D) and Chadwick[1] measured the afterglow\u000d\u000a      using X-ray excitation using combined techniques developed by Chadwick,\u000d\u000a      Mountjoy and others [2,3]. Short- and long-life relaxations times were\u000d\u000a      monitored for crystals with and without the presence of Eu and Sm. It was\u000d\u000a      found that there are two distinct afterglows, long-term and short-term and\u000d\u000a      that doping by rare-earths is only effective for short-term afterglow\u000d\u000a      reduction. Further, different growth conditions were explored. It had been\u000d\u000a      proposed that Tl is a determining factor controlling the afterglow in CsI\u000d\u000a      as this element may form Tl-dimers or defects in the structure. For this\u000d\u000a      purpose the local structure of CsI(Tl) structure was determined using\u000d\u000a      X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS) [1-3] in combination with atomistic\u000d\u000a      simulations [unpublished, performed by M. Alfredsson and A. Blacklocks].\u000d\u000a      The introduction of rare-earth dopants decreases afterglow substantially,\u000d\u000a      but other properties such as hydroscopicity increase, limiting the range\u000d\u000a      of applications.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1667","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Intelligent Fingerprinting Ltd., a spin-out company created from\u000d\u000a      the research of Professor David Russell [corroborating source A], has\u000d\u000a      developed a unique in vitro diagnostic technology platform that\u000d\u000a      non-invasively screens for metabolites present in fingerprint sweat while\u000d\u000a      simultaneously enabling determination of personal identity.

As part of this research, gold nanoparticles were\u000d\u000a      synthesised and then stabilised with a monolayer of Protein A.\u000d\u000a      Anti-cotinine antibody was then bound to the Protein A on the\u000d\u000a      nanoparticles to provide a conjugate that was used to detect cotinine, the\u000d\u000a      major metabolite of nicotine, in the fingerprints of smokers. The antibody\u000d\u000a      conjugates bound to the cotinine antigens, while a fluorescently-tagged\u000d\u000a      secondary antibody fragment was used to image the fingerprints. Not only\u000d\u000a      did the reagents detect the drugs and drug metabolites in fingerprints,\u000d\u000a      but they simultaneously provided a high resolution image of the print to\u000d\u000a      establish the identity of the individual.\u000d\u000a    Initial research was performed by M.Chem. student Emma Lee-Smith\u000d\u000a      during her final year research project in 2005 under the supervision of\u000d\u000a      Professor Russell. Her work and subsequent Ph.D. research studies by Richard\u000a        Leggett (Ph.D. awarded in 2007), also from the Russell laboratory,\u000d\u000a      were patented (1) and then published (2). Following publication, there was\u000d\u000a      considerable media attention as this was the first report that drug\u000d\u000a      metabolites, and therefore drug usage, could be determined from the sweat\u000d\u000a      deposited in a fingerprint. These results also provided preliminary data\u000d\u000a      for a collaborative EPSRC research grant (i) with Dr Sue Jickells and Dr\u000d\u000a      Barbara Daniel from the Department of Forensic Science and Drug Monitoring\u000d\u000a      at King's College London.\u000d\u000a    The EPSRC research grant supported Dr Pompi Hazarika\u000d\u000a      (post-doctoral research associate at UEA, 2006-2010) who developed iron\u000d\u000a      oxide based particles which were functionalised with Protein A\/G. Protein\u000d\u000a      A\/G is a recombinant fusion protein that combines IgG-binding domains of\u000d\u000a      both Protein A and Protein G. This created an exceptionally versatile\u000d\u000a      platform on which numerous classes of antibodies could be bound. The\u000d\u000a      platform technology was used to conjugate various antibodies that\u000d\u000a      specifically bind to their target antigen. These antibody-particle\u000d\u000a      conjugates were used to detect: 03949- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the\u000d\u000a      main psychoactive component of marijuana; methadone, a synthetic opioid\u000d\u000a      generally prescribed as a substitute pharmacotherapy to heroin-dependent\u000d\u000a      patients; 2-ethylidene- 1,5-dimethyl 3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), the\u000d\u000a      major metabolite of methadone; and benzoylecgonine, the major metabolite\u000d\u000a      of cocaine in the fingerprints of volunteers attending a methadone\u000d\u000a      maintenance programme (3). Publication of paper (3) prompted further\u000d\u000a      significant media attention since the paper highlighted the detection of\u000d\u000a      illegal drugs and drug metabolites using the antibody-magnetic particle\u000d\u000a      conjugates.\u000d\u000a    An EPSRC Follow-on Fund grant (ii) was awarded to Russell in 2009 to\u000d\u000a      further develop the antibody-particle conjugates for forensic\u000d\u000a      applications. Results from this study reported the multiplexed detection\u000d\u000a      of two drug metabolites (from heroin and cocaine) in a single\u000d\u000a      fingerprint (4).\u000d\u000a    The University of East Anglia patented the technology, focused on the\u000d\u000a      antibody-particle conjugates for the combination of drug detection and\u000d\u000a      personal identity, in 2007 (1).

A\u000a      change of research direction coincided with Professor Pickett's move to\u000a      the School of Chemistry, University of East Anglia (UEA) in 2005.\u000a    The academic research programme addressed the construction of electrode\u000a      interfaces in which bioinorganic reaction centres were confined within an\u000a      electropolymer matrix. It was found that such electropolymers could be\u000a      grown on medical stainless steels, which opened the possibility for\u000a      biomedical implant applications. A spin-out company, Chameleon\u000a        Biosurfaces Ltd., was established to pursue these applications. In\u000a      2003, Chameleon Biosurfaces Ltd. performed an initial rabbit\u000a      dorsal muscle implant study with four types of electropolymer,\u000a      establishing that the materials were well tolerated in the in vivo\u000a      environment. This result, together with their high conformality and\u000a      adhesion to medical steels, suggested that the electropolymers could be of\u000a      benefit in the area of polymer-coated drug-eluting coronary stents.\u000a      However, while commercially available coronary drug eluting stents were\u000a      successful in inhibiting restenosis, in 2005 there were significant\u000a      emerging problems with late stent thrombosis. This was variously\u000a      attributed to polymer detachment, poor biocompatibility and delayed\u000a      re-endothelialisation.\u000a    Late stent thrombosis defined the medical problem which Chameleon\u000a        Biosurfaces Ltd. sought to address when the company relocated to UEA\u000a      in 2005. Dedicated laboratory and office space was provided within the\u000a      School of Chemistry and four personnel employed by Chameleon\u000a        Biosurfaces Ltd.: Dr Jane Knott was employed to undertake synthesis\u000a      of innovative pyrroles; Dr Steven Ryley was appointed as a senior\u000a      scientist and worked on the project until December 2008; Dr John Tolland\u000a      undertook biophysical studies of the electropolymer coatings; Mr Christian\u000a      Greef was employed as a research technician in 2007 for 20 months.\u000a    The research at UEA led to the synthesis and electropolymerisation of\u000a      unprecedented, highly functionalised poly(pyrroles), bearing cysteine and\u000a      other motifs capable of binding synthetic ferredoxin and hydrogenase\u000a      clusters (references 1 and 2). In 2007, a histological study of\u000a      functionalised poly(pyrrole) coated stents following implantation in\u000a      porcine coronary arteries was undertaken in conjunction with the St Joseph\u000a      Medical Center, Atlanta (USA). This showed that the new functionalised\u000a      poly(pyrrole) coatings were biocompatible in vivo over a period of\u000a      three months, presenting a low polymer burden (reference 3).\u000a    Subsequent research on antithrombolytic electropolymers led to the\u000a      synthesis of pyrrole monomers, with molecular motifs related to allicins,\u000a      and studies of their electropolymerisation. These studies showed that such\u000a      surface functionality resulted in low levels of platelet binding,\u000a      agglomeration and thrombus formation. Real-time dynamic studies of the\u000a      behaviour of the electropolymer coatings were carried out on whole blood\u000a      samples, in collaboration with Professor Richard Farndale at Cambridge\u000a      University. Importantly, sulfur and\/or allyl functionality of these\u000a      pyrroles conferred excellent adhesion to medical steel substrates. The\u000a      research on these innovative, low thrombogenicity electropolymer materials\u000a      was patented (reference 4).\u000a    Follow-on fund support from the BBSRC (2006 - 2007) enabled studies of\u000a      drug confinement in the electropolymer matrices for neurostimulator\u000a      coatings.

The project was specifically targeted to solve an\u000a      existing problem in the treatment of waterlogged wood that is described\u000a      above. Eleanor Schofield was appointed as a postdoctoral research\u000a      assistant during the period of the award. As a result of the training she\u000a      obtained at the University of Kent, and the progress she made with the\u000a      development of new chemical treatments, she subsequently became\u000a      Conservation Manager for the Mary Rose Trust, with overall responsibility\u000a      for chemistry related conservation. She has overseen the implementation of\u000a      the University of Kent technology to treat numerous salvaged items. The\u000a      figure below shows one of the many gun carriages on display that were\u000a      treated using the University of Kent method. These items would not be on\u000a      display if the University of Kent research had not been carried out. \u000a    Beneficiaries and Significance of the Conservation of the Mary Rose\u000a    The work led by the University of Kent has a local impact on the economy\u000a      of Portsmouth and the South East, a national impact in the position of the\u000a      Mary Rose within British history, and an international impact on the\u000a      conservation and heritage industry.\u000a    The restored Mary Rose forms a centrepiece attraction in Portsmouth's\u000a      Historic Dockyard: in its new purpose-built museum it is a major visitor\u000a      attraction and cultural asset to its region. The Dockyard attracts around\u000a      500,000 visitors a year, approximately 15-20% from overseas and it is\u000a      anticipated that these numbers will grow further with the opening of the\u000a      Mary Rose (Portsmouth Historic Dockyard Ltd.). The Mary Rose Trust\u000a      received &#163;2m from visitors, in donations and trading income in 2012; it\u000a      also has an active learning and outreach programme (Mary Rose Trust Annual\u000a      Review 2013). \u000a    \u000a      \u000a      \u000a       Kent research enabled the conservation of artefacts, such as\u000a        the gun carriages (left) that would otherwise not be on display. The Mary\u000a          Rose project is a lasting legacy to Tudor life that will be\u000a        enjoyed for many generations to come. The uniqueness of the exhibition\u000a        (right) prompted historian David Starkey to describe it as the \"British\u000a        Pompeii\" \u000a    \u000a     The preservation of Mary Rose has major historical significance as a\u000a      well-preserved example of Tudor history. Without the preservation of the\u000a      artefacts - of which the ship itself if the greatest - it would not be\u000a      possible for the museum to tell the full story of this period of history:\u000a      \"In the original museum less than 10% of the recovered artefacts were on\u000a      display. In the new museum many thousands more artefacts will be displayed\u000a      in context, many never seen before. Preparing all this material has been a\u000a      huge task. The remarkable state of preservation of some of these articles\u000a      can be confusing because everything wooden on display in the new museum is\u000a      a conserved original. There are no organic replicas on display.\" (Mary\u000a      Rose Trust Annual Review 2013). The impact of the work is also evidenced\u000a      by interest from other conservators. Dr Emma Hocker, a conservator at the\u000a      Vasa commented on the research at the University of Kent: \"We at the Vasa\u000a      Museum are always interested in new treatments to neutralise acids in\u000a      wood. What is intriguing about the University of Kent's method is that it\u000a      is not a one-off treatment, but since the nano-particles remain in the\u000a      wood, they act as a buffer ready to neutralise any new acidic outbreaks.\"\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The warship Mary Rose served Henry VIII's navy for 34 years, including\u000a      spells as the flagship.

However, this does not mean that the\u000a      environment is benign, which was first highlighted during the restoration\u000a      of the Vasa. The Swedish warship spent 333 years under the Stockholm\u000a      archipelago after collapsing on her maiden voyage. She was salvaged in\u000a      1961 and put on display in 1990; a project approximately 20 year ahead of\u000a      the Mary Rose. Although the oak beams were seemingly in excellent\u000a      condition when first raised above the surface, the ship dramatically\u000a      deteriorated while in the museum [Nature 415 893 (2002)]. The problem lay\u000a      in the nature of the treatment used to stabilise the wood after salvage.\u000a      In this process, a preservation solution of boric acid and sodium borate\u000a      was applied to neutralise the acidity, along with polyethylene glycol to\u000a      replace the water and prevent warping as the wood dries. What quickly\u000a      became apparent was that the acidity of the wood increased and sulphate\u000a      salts began to coat the surfaces, which \"threatened the continued\u000a      preservation of the Vasa\". It was suggested that the problem originated\u000a      from hydrogen sulphide produced by bacteria within the waterlogged wood\u000a      while submerged. The preservation solution initially lowered the acidity\u000a      on treatment, but the slow oxidation of the sulphur containing material,\u000a      catalysed by the presence of iron from structural bolts etc, was creating\u000a      an ongoing acidity problem, which \"could produce 5,000kg of sulphuric acid\u000a      when fully oxidised.\" The University of Kent solved this issue by\u000a      understand the oxidation process [1, 2, 5], and developed a completely\u000a      different treatment that neutralises both the inherent acidity, as well as\u000a      acting as a buffer for the ongoing sulphur-related problem [3, 4, 6]. \u000a    Key Research Findings at University of Kent\u000a    Dr Eleanor Schofield was appointed a postdoctoral research\u000a      scientist by Professor Alan Chadwick [Kent 1970-present] of the\u000a      School of Physical Sciences, University of Kent between January 2009 and\u000a      June 2011 to study \"abiotic production of acid in waterlogged\u000a      archaeological wood and remediation strategies\". She focused on addressing\u000a      the sulphur issue, while Aaron Berko, University of Kent, focussed\u000a      on iron removal for his PhD during the same time. The Kent team developed\u000a      detailed chemical mechanisms of how sulphates, naturally present in sea\u000a      water, interacted with bacteria to form reduced sulphur compounds, such as\u000a      hydrogen sulphide, which can undergo further reactions with iron to form\u000a      iron sulphides [1]. Although not particularly harmful themselves, lifting\u000a      the wood out of the water sets off a new set of reactions, where the air\u000a      oxidises the plethora of sulphur compounds formed under the seabed into\u000a      harmful sulphuric acid that attacks the wood. Using this knowledge, the\u000a      Kent scientists studied a number of alternative treatments, making use of\u000a      synchrotron beam lines at Stanford, USA and Diamond, UK, to characterise\u000a      their effectiveness [2]. It was shown that strontium carbonate\u000a      nanoparticles (in an isopropanol solution) reduced both the inherent\u000a      acidity (as achieved by the Vasa treatment), as well as the ongoing\u000a      acidity originating from the reduced sulphur compounds [4, 6]. This new\u000a      technique has been extensively implemented on the Mary Rose project and\u000a      represents a major achievement as the new treatment developed at the\u000a      University of Kent permanently stabilises waterlogged items, preventing\u000a      further degradation and requires no addition treatments.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3264","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Nearly all solid medicines like tablets and capsules contain drugs in\u000a      crystalline form; and all crystals have the potential to `morph' into not\u000a      one but many alternative forms. The likelihood of the crystals actually\u000a      changing and becoming a danger to patients is very small but it can and\u000a      does happen, with catastrophic consequences.\u000a    In 1988, a clinical failure of Tegretol (carbamazepine) tablets, the\u000a      anticonvulsant widely used with epilepsy, was observed. It was believed to\u000a      be caused by a phase conversion from the anhydrate to dehydrate form. In\u000a      1998 Abbott Laboratories withdrew Norvir (ritonavir), essential at that\u000a      time in the treatment of HIV\/AIDS, because the capsules unexpectedly\u000a      failed dissolution tests. The public were without an essential drug while\u000a      researchers investigated. They finally identified that the drug crystals\u000a      had changed into a more stable, less soluble polymorph which contaminated\u000a      laboratories and effectively halted production processes. They had to\u000a      completely reformulate the drug and develop a new capsule product. The\u000a      case cost Abbott hundreds of millions of dollars and over 600 scientists\u000a      working for nearly a year to resolve the issue. The estimated loss in\u000a      sales in 1998 alone is $250m.\u000a    Pfizer experienced similar problems with two drugs in development and\u000a      concluded that a deeper scientific knowledge of polymorphism was an\u000a      emerging need in the pharmaceutical industry. The consequences were\u000a      typically catastrophic, hard to predict, clinically and economically\u000a      unacceptable, and damaging to patients' trust in the company to produce\u000a      the quality products they relied on.\u000a    Pfizer identified internal and external drivers for the need to\u000a      understand polymorphism on a more scientifically rigorous basis. These\u000a      drivers included:\u000a    \u000a      emphasis on the chemical rather than physical attributes of drugs and\u000a        excipients;\u000a      the instrumentation used to characterise polymorphism was relatively\u000a        simplistic and unable to predict the potential for phase transition;\u000a      the existing protocols to test physical performance required large\u000a        quantities of expensive pure solid drug, and occurred too late in the\u000a        development process to stimulate the re-engineering of defective\u000a        crystalline drug forms;\u000a      an industry-wide drive for more rapid drug development and clinical\u000a        testing.\u000a    \u000a    Pfizer turned to the University of Greenwich to develop the scientific\u000a      methodology to:\u000a    \u000a      produce small quantities of highly purified drug crystals, alone and\u000a        in drug product matrices, from side streams of conventional pilot\u000a        batches;\u000a      use the pure drugs to develop tests on single crystals, a process\u000a        which is much cheaper and can be performed at the start rather than end\u000a        of the drug development process;\u000a      develop tests that could predict polymorph instability and how they\u000a        behave during manufacture, and in turn allow the engineering and\u000a        understanding of new solid-state forms for development.\u000a    \u000a    Since 2008 Pfizer has been able to apply the resulting methodologies,\u000a      systematically to the development of crystalline APIs for use in solid\u000a      oral and inhalation dosage forms. The company has also applied them to\u000a      understand the risk for products licensed from other companies not using\u000a      this scientific paradigm. Pfizer has invested &#163;2.4m in the university to\u000a      date. The programme has resulted in critical technology and human resource\u000a      transfer to the company as well as 27 refereed publications. To date 24\u000a      researchers have progressed through the scheme; 40% have taken up posts\u000a      within Pfizer and 42% with other leading pharmaceutical companies.\u000a    The larger impacts are that Pfizer has vastly reduced the risk of\u000a      polymorphism in its drugs, increasing the confidence of patients and\u000a      health professionals. Examples of what might have happened without the\u000a      university's pioneering research abound, for instance to UCB with\u000a      Parkinson's disease drug rotigotine. Filed in 2003 as a drug that did not\u000a      exhibit polymorphism, rotigotine was delivered through Neupro skin patches\u000a      and many patients experienced an improved quality of life. In 2008,\u000a      dendritic structures were observed: a new form polymorph had crystallised\u000a      which reduced the patches' efficacy. The product was withdrawn in the US\u000a      in 2008 and did not return to the market until 2012. Similarly, in 2010\u000a      BMS withdrew 64 million Avalide tablets (hydrochlorthiazide and\u000a      irbesartan) over concerns that irbesartan crystals had converted to a less\u000a      soluble polymorph. Avalide sales were calculated to be $310 million in the\u000a      first nine months of 2010. Pfizer is able to safeguard its patients and\u000a      avoid the cost associated with recalls and the redevelopment and relaunch\u000a      of clinically essential products.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Nearly all solid dosage forms contain drugs in crystalline form; and all\u000a      crystals have the potential to `morph', suddenly, into different forms\u000a      which can affect the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product.

Dr.\u000d\u000a      Graham Eastham (Senior Research Scientist for ALPHA Technology, Lucite\u000d\u000a      International) recognised the significance of the Cardiff contribution in\u000d\u000a      developing \"a commercially viable synthetic route to produce the phosphine\u000d\u000a      ligand...without this early innovation the Alpha process may well not have\u000d\u000a      become the unqualified success that it is\" [5.1].\u000d\u000a    The key to the process is the remarkable efficiency of the catalyst for\u000d\u000a      the addition of carbon monoxide to ethylene, which is fast (producing 13\u000d\u000a      kg of methyl propanoate for 1 g of palladium metal per hour of operation)\u000d\u000a      and cost efficient with regard to the amount of expensive and rare\u000d\u000a      palladium metal consumed (10 tonnes of product produced for 1 g of metal\u000d\u000a      consumed). The remarkable selectivity and efficiency of the catalyst\u000d\u000a      allows reliable production under milder reaction conditions, which has a\u000d\u000a      significant beneficial impact on operating costs, safety and energy\u000d\u000a      efficiency. Lucite International estimates that the Alpha process reduces\u000d\u000a      costs by 30-40% compared to the established acetone-cyanohydrin (ACH)\u000d\u000a      process, the mainstay of US and European MMA production, which has\u000d\u000a      remained largely unchanged since the 1930s.\u000d\u000a    The Alpha process has removed constraints on plant size allowing\u000d\u000a      significantly improved operating economies. As a result of the industrial\u000d\u000a      viability of the process, Lucite invested US$230 Million in 2008 in a\u000d\u000a      manufacturing plant in Singapore to produce 120 kilotonnes of MMA per\u000d\u000a      annum [5.2]. The plant has been running at 100% capacity to date, and\u000d\u000a      accounts for around 3% of global MMA production. Based on the success of\u000d\u000a      the Singapore plant, Mitsubishi Group signed a Letter of Intent with Saudi\u000d\u000a      Basic Industries Corporation, with the tender to issue in 2013, to build\u000d\u000a      the largest MMA plant in the world, costing US$500 million and producing\u000d\u000a      250 kilotonnes annually (around 6% of global production) [5.3].\u000d\u000a    The Alpha Process also produces purer MMA, which increases end-user\u000d\u000a      applications. Lucite Perspex is in demand for high margin applications\u000d\u000a      such as screens for mobile phones, televisions and computer monitors,\u000d\u000a      since Alpha process Perspex offers maximum light transmission without\u000d\u000a      disturbing surface hot spots. Growing demand in this area complements\u000d\u000a      conventional uses, including glazing, signage and lighting, moulding and\u000d\u000a      extrusion compounds for automotive, medical and optical industries,\u000d\u000a      surface coatings, emulsion polymers, adhesives, and enamels. Lucite\u000d\u000a      International is the world leader in MMA and PMMA production, with around\u000d\u000a      25-30% of the global market share, which is valued in excess of US$7\u000d\u000a      Billion annually and projected to show annual growth of 6.5% up to 2017\u000d\u000a      [5.4].\u000d\u000a    Environmental benefits\u000d\u000a    The Alpha process brings environmental benefits compared to conventional\u000d\u000a      manufacturing technologies, such as the ACH process, which rely on the use\u000d\u000a      of feedstocks that are highly toxic (hydrogen cyanide) and highly\u000d\u000a      corrosive (sulfuric acid). For example, Alpha Process production at the\u000d\u000a      Lucite Singapore plant produces annual savings of 19 kilotonnes of\u000d\u000a      hydrogen cyanide and annual savings of 360 kilotonnes of spent acid,\u000d\u000a      including sulfuric acid and ammonium sulphate, compared to the\u000d\u000a      conventional ACH route.\u000d\u000a    A further supply chain benefit of the Alpha Process is that it uses\u000d\u000a      cheap, relatively non- hazardous and readily available feedstocks (carbon\u000d\u000a      monoxide, ethylene, formaldehyde and methanol). The atom-efficiency of the\u000d\u000a      process also brings waste management benefits, as it means that there are\u000d\u000a      no toxic wastes or by-products [5.2].\u000d\u000a    These environmental benefits also have an impact on manufacturing\u000d\u000a      efficiencies through, for example, the reduced use of solvents and reduced\u000d\u000a      storage and waste management facilities required at the Singapore and\u000d\u000a      Saudi facilities. A purer MMA product also has knock-on benefits for\u000d\u000a      downstream users and applications industries in minimising requirements\u000d\u000a      for further purification as well as providing assurance of a dependable\u000d\u000a      supply of higher quality plastics from readily available feedstocks.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Cardiff University, through developing and patenting a commercially\u000d\u000a      viable synthetic route to a catalyst, has enabled the application of a new\u000d\u000a      process, the Alpha Process, for the production of methyl methacrylate\u000d\u000a      (MMA), a key commodity precursor to Perspex.

Molpro\u000d\u000a      provides the ability to calculate from first principles (ab initio) the\u000d\u000a      properties of molecular matter. It\u000d\u000a      is unique and differs from other quantum chemistry packages because, using\u000d\u000a      local electron\u000d\u000a      correlation methods, it significantly reduces the increase of the\u000d\u000a      computational cost with molecular\u000d\u000a      size. This means highly accurate computations can be performed for much\u000d\u000a      larger molecules than\u000d\u000a      with most other programs, and the screening of far wider libraries of\u000d\u000a      potential new materials is\u000d\u000a      enabled.

Linear-scaling Hartree-Fock methodology using local orbitals\u000d\u000a      [3.2]. This 2004 paper\u000d\u000a      showed for the first time how to compute molecular orbitals for large\u000d\u000a      molecules, including\u000d\u000a      the exchange interaction exactly, with effort that scales linearly with\u000d\u000a      the size of the\u000d\u000a      molecule. This was a key step in making more accurate correlated\u000d\u000a      linear-scaling methods\u000d\u000a      feasible, since before this work was done, Hartree-Fock was the\u000d\u000a        computational\u000d\u000a        bottleneck. The distinctive feature of the Cardiff contribution, essential\u000d\u000a        to the success of\u000d\u000a        the project, was the use of innovative basis sets based on the\u000d\u000a        solutions of Poisson's\u000d\u000a        equation, which provides a speed-up by a factor of approximately two.\u000d\u000a    B. Portable one-sided remote memory access in parallel scientific\u000d\u000a      computing [3.3]. This work,\u000d\u000a      conducted in Cardiff between 2007 and 2011, addressed an important\u000d\u000a      challenge in the use\u000d\u000a      of parallel computers for computations involving large intermediate data\u000d\u000a      structures. In most\u000d\u000a      of the electronic structure methods embodied in Molpro, very large\u000d\u000a      matrices are distributed\u000d\u000a      across the processors of a parallel machine, and data must sometimes be\u000d\u000a      accessed by a\u000d\u000a      process that is remote from the node on which the data are stored. The MPI\u000d\u000a      parallelisation\u000d\u000a      standard does not provide properly for this, and until this work it was\u000d\u000a      necessary to use non-\u000d\u000a      standard libraries to achieve this function. In this work, new algorithms\u000d\u000a      for managing data\u000d\u000a      were designed, implemented completely portably within the MPI standard,\u000d\u000a      and\u000d\u000a      performance-analysed. This research and its deployment is crucial for the\u000d\u000a      operation of the\u000d\u000a      whole Molpro software system on the high-performance computers of today\u000d\u000a      and tomorrow,\u000d\u000a      where parallelism becomes more and more important, and all Molpro\u000d\u000a        calculations on\u000d\u000a        large machines now depend on this work.\u000d\u000a    C.

Oligonucleotides\u000a        containing this 3'-sp linkage are an essential component in a DNA\u000a      sequencing method known as SOLiD&#8482; (Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation\u000a      and Detection). SOLiD sequencing was launched by Applied Biosystems Inc\u000a      (ABI, now incorporated into Life Technologies as of 2008) in 2007 and the\u000a      SOLiD sequencing instruments became commercially available in 2008.6,7\u000a      The SOLiD method is based on sequencing by ligation and uses universal\u000a      sequencing primers (essentially short oligonucleotides containing the 3-sp\u000a      linkage) to interrogate the DNA template to be sequenced. The sequence is\u000a      read through rounds of hybridisation, ligation, detection and cleavage.\u000a      The cleavage step removes the fluorescent label (required for the\u000a      detection step) from the 5'-end of the oligonucleotide and resets the\u000a      system for the next round of hybridisation and ligation, so that the next\u000a      nucleotide can be sequenced. The specific cleavage step of the 3'-sp\u000a      linkage, which is conducted under mild conditions compatible with the\u000a      requirements of the SOLiD method using aqueous silver ions as demonstrated\u000a      by Cosstick,1 is crucial: at the time when the method was\u000a      developed, no other of DNA modification was known to work in SOLiD\u000a      sequencing. Details of the sequencing method and the role of the 3'-sp\u000a      linkage are clearly evident from the patents of McKernan8 and\u000a      from a review article on sulfur analogues of nucleic acids by Zon.9\u000a      Cosstick's chemistry was thus decisive in enabling implementation of SOLiD\u000a      sequencing. It was subsequently shown that SOLiD sequencing can also be\u000a      performed in what is known as \"the reverse direction\" using the isomeric\u000a      5'-sp linkages,8,9 but in this case an additional step is\u000a      necessary to remove the 3'-phosphate prior to ligation.\u000a    In 2006, ABI were working on the development of their SOLiD sequencing\u000a      method and needed to produce oligonucleotides containing the 3'-sp\u000a      linkages on a large-scale, as these were essential reagents for the SOLiD\u000a      instruments. Their synthetic approach to the large-scale synthesis of\u000a      these oligonucleotides was principally based on scaling-up the synthetic\u000a      procedures published by Cosstick in 2004.2 On invitation from\u000a      Dr Gerry Zon (then director of sequencing chemistry), Cosstick visited the\u000a      ABI chemistry labs (Foster City, CA, USA) in October 2006 for detailed\u000a      discussions relating to some of the difficulties the chemistry sequencing\u000a      group had encountered with the synthesis of 3'-sp modified\u000a      oligonucleotides. At that time there was considerable urgency to establish\u000a      an efficient method for the production of the 3'-sp modified\u000a      oligonucleotides in order to meet the demand for these reagents when the\u000a      instruments became commercially available.\u000a    In terms of their performance, the latest SOLiD instruments (5500 series\u000a      genetic analysers) deliver greater than 90 giga base-pairs of sequence\u000a      information in one day and a 7 day run can complete the sequence of the\u000a      human genome. The two-base encoding, which is unique to the SOLiD method,\u000a      provides exceptional sequencing accuracy at &gt;99.94%, (for\u000a      further information see: http:\/\/tools.lifetechnologies.com\/content\/sfs\/brochures\/cms_057511.pdf),10\u000a      as each nucleotide in the sequence is essentially read twice. The SOLiD\u000a      technology is one of several so-called second\/next-generation sequencing\u000a      systems (together with instruments from Illumina, Roche and to a lesser\u000a      extent Helicos) which were available as of 2008. Each of these sequencing\u000a      systems seems to have its own advantages and limitations, although in 2011\u000a      the SOLiD system was reported to have the lowest reagent cost needed\u000a        to reassemble a human genome11 and came top in the J.P.\u000a      Morgan Next Generation Sequencing Survey12 (published in 2010)\u000a      for accuracy. Accuracy was also shown to be the most important attribute\u000a      when choosing a DNA sequencing system.12\u000a    The estimated sales value of SOLiD sequencing systems to Life\u000a        Technolgies is also presented in the J.P. Morgan survey12\u000a        and rose from zero in 2007 to $68 million in 2008, $100million in 2009\u000a        and predicted sales of $136.9 million in 2010, $178 million in 2011 and\u000a        $222.5 million in 2012 (figures based on J.P. Morgan estimates and\u000a      company reports12). In 2010, only two years after becoming\u000a      commercially available, the SOLiD instrument was estimated to have about\u000a      20% market share for second\/next-generation sequencing and was predicted\u000a      to rise to 22.6% (second largest market share after Illumina) by 2012.12\u000a      New jobs created by commercialization of SOLiD sequencing include\u000a      USA-based manufacturing of consumable reagents, world-wide hiring of\u000a      technical specialists to support customers, and (especially) world-wide\u000a      sample preparation, sequencing and bioinformatics analysis at\u000a      service-provider facilities.\u000a    The benefit of the SOLiD sequencing system goes beyond that of generating\u000a      economic impact, as the technology is now enabling patients to benefit\u000a        from personalised medicine derived from DNA sequence information.\u000a      For example, whole genome sequencing (conducted with the SOLiD 4\u000a      instrument) of twins with dopamine-responsive dystonia, a clinically\u000a      complex neurological movement disorder, that is normally treated with\u000a      L-dopa, identified unexpected mutations in the gene encoding sepiapterin\u000a      reductase. This enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of co-factors\u000a      required for the synthesis of dopamine and seratonin. Supplement of the\u000a      L-dopa therapy with a serotonin precursor resulted in considerable\u000a      clinical improvements in both twins.13\u000a    The exceptional accuracy of the 2-base encoding means that SOLiD\u000a      sequencing is ideally suited to cancer research\/diagnosis, because tumors\u000a      contain mixed sub-populations with different mutations. Deep-sequencing on\u000a      the SOLiD platform has revealed differential expression of microRNAs in\u000a      favourable versus unfavourable neuroblastoma (the most common extracranial\u000a      solid tumor of childhood) and provides a reliable method to assess the\u000a      aggressiveness and hence prognosis of the tumor.14 Whilst just\u000a      two specific examples are presented here, they indicate the tremendous\u000a      scope of the SOLiD sequencing technique to aid diagnosis and treatment of\u000a      a wide range of diseases.\u000a    There is a list of over 100 publications resulting from SOLiD sequencing\u000a      at the Life Technologies website which cover applications on: sequencing\u000a      accuracy, bioinformatics, de novo sequencing, targeted resequencing and\u000a      transcriptome analysis (further details available at: http:\/\/www.invitrogen.com\/site\/us\/en\/home\/Products-and-Services\/Applications\/Sequencing\/Next-Generation-Sequencing\/Publications-Literature.html\u000a      )10\u000a    The wealth of research that was conducted by the Cosstick group on DNA\u000a      containing the 3'-S-phosphorothiolate linkage has been absolutely\u000a      crucial to the development of SOLiD sequencing. The contribution that the\u000a      work in Liverpool made to the SOLiD programme has been corroborated by Dr\u000a      Gerry Zon15 (letter available) who was directing the ABI\u000a      chemistry sequencing group in Foster City (USA) at the time SOLiD\u000a      sequencing was being developed. To quote from Dr Zon's letter, \"the\u000a        scale-up of the synthesis of the phosphorothiolate-containing DNA\u000a        reagents had to be done in a very short period of time, because of\u000a        competing sequencing techniques which were due to come on the market.

This modification was\u000a      originally designed by Cosstick (then lecturer in Chemistry, University of\u000a      Liverpool) as a DNA analogue that was expected to be resistant to cleavage\u000a      by enzymes that process and manipulate DNA, but susceptible to cleavage by\u000a      mild chemical reagents. The motivation for this research was to provide\u000a      new approaches to manipulate DNA that might find applications in\u000a      biotechnology. The chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides (short pieces of\u000a      DNA) containing this modification was first reported by the Cosstick\u000a      Group. An important step towards realising the potential application of\u000a      the 3'-sp modification was the subsequent report by Cosstick and\u000a      co-workers that a DNA molecule with 7250 natural phosphate linkages could\u000a      be specifically cleaved at the site of a single 3'-sp linkage by aqueous\u000a      solutions of silver ions.1 It was apparent at this time that in\u000a      order to fully explore the potential applications of the 3'-sp\u000a      modification greatly improved methods were required for its preparation\u000a      and thus through the 1990s and 2000s the Cosstick group reported a number\u000a      of methods for the chemical synthesis of DNA sequences containing the\u000a      3'-sp modification. These studies culminated in the key report (2004) of a\u000a      preparative method based on the use of 3'-S-phosphorothioamidites\u000a      which was compatible with standard automated procedures for the chemical\u000a      synthesis of DNA. This method therefore made oligonucleotides containing\u000a      the 3'-sp linkage much more readily accessible by routine DNA synthesis\u000a      procedures.2\u000a\u0009  \u000a      \u000a      \u000a    The resulting improved access to these 3'-sp DNA analogues made it\u000a      possible to investigate their interactions with complementary sequences of\u000a      DNA or RNA in much greater detail. It was shown that a DNA strand\u000a      containing this modification could form duplex structures with either\u000a      complementary DNA or RNA strands and indeed the 3'-sp modification\u000a      actually stabilised some of these structures.3,4 Significantly,\u000a      it was established that the effect of the 3'-sp modification had a\u000a      predictable effect on the thermal melting temperature of complementary\u000a      oligonucleotides. This was important in establishing that DNA containing\u000a      the 3'-sp modification would be compatible with the hybridisation steps in\u000a      the SOLiD sequencing technique.\u000a    In summary, the work conducted by the Cosstick group at Liverpool has\u000a      covered the synthesis of the 3'-sp DNA analogues, the effect that this\u000a      modification has on duplex and higher order DNA\/RNA structures and their\u000a      mild chemical and enzymatic cleavage. This work established information on\u000a      all the important chemical properties of this modification and thus\u000a      provided the necessary background from which the chemical\/biochemical\u000a      aspects of the sequencing method could be developed.

Now they have taken hazardous residues from the\u000d\u000a      bottom of the waste hierarchy to the top by commercialising ACT's\u000d\u000a      application to UK-derived APCR to produce building materials, via spin-out\u000d\u000a      company Carbon8 Aggregates (C8A). By 2012 C8A had\u000d\u000a      commissioned the world's first commercial plant using ACT to produce\u000d\u000a      aggregate from APCR in Brandon, Suffolk, at a cost of &#163;1M [5.1]. Today the\u000d\u000a      plant is producing 32,000 tonnes of carbonated aggregate (C8Agg) per year,\u000d\u000a      which block manufacturer Lignacite turns into the world's first carbon\u000d\u000a      negative concrete blocks with values as low as-40 kg CO \/ tonne of\u000d\u000a      product.2 The way is now open to apply ACT to many other waste streams,\u000d\u000a      including contaminated soil.\u000d\u000a    ACT delivers five main benefits by:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      reducing the risks associated with hazardous waste and contaminated\u000d\u000a        soil\u000d\u000a      capturing and stores significant volumes of greenhouse gas CO2\u000a\u000d\u000a      recycling waste into a valuable aggregate\u000d\u000a      reducing waste going to landfill\u000d\u000a      producing aggregates in minutes rather than months, making the process\u000d\u000a        commercially viable.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The CO2 used in ACT comes from industrial processes, thereby\u000d\u000a      recycling gas, which would otherwise pollute the atmosphere. However to\u000d\u000a      date it has been supplied in tankers from a sugar beet manufacturing\u000d\u000a      plant. C8A is now working with key UK waste management companies to `close\u000d\u000a      the loop' by using the actual CO2 produced by the incineration\u000d\u000a      of municipal solid waste (MSW) that also produces the APCRs: thus the\u000d\u000a      gaseous and solid wastes are valorised simultaneously. This is a perfectly\u000d\u000a      sustainable method for managing the 185,000 tonnes of MSW APCRs produced\u000d\u000a      in the UK every year; if adopted it would offset the CO2\u000d\u000a      produced by 10,000 cars.\u000d\u000a    Two more ACT plants will be built in 2014 and another is in planning,\u000d\u000a      increasing production capacity to &gt;100,000 tonnes by the end of 2014.\u000d\u000a      UK incinerator operators have included ACT treatment of APCRs in tenders\u000d\u000a      for new-build MSW incinerators, allowing them to demonstrate improved\u000d\u000a      sustainability credentials (zero landfill) and lower costs. C8S\u000d\u000a      has also identified potential for simultaneous valorisation of other key\u000d\u000a      waste streams.\u000d\u000a    C8S developed the technology to optimise the continuous treatment\u000d\u000a      of ashes through strategic partnerships with Viridor Waste Management,\u000d\u000a      Kent County Council and the Environment Agency, together with funding from\u000d\u000a      Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) and the Technology Strategy Board. As\u000d\u000a      a result a new company C8A was formed to treat Air Pollution\u000d\u000a      Control Residues (APCr) and a commercial-scale plant was built in 2010 at\u000d\u000a      Brandon in Suffolk. More than 200T of aggregate was made and tested by two\u000d\u000a      major UK block manufacturers. It was this proof of concept that led to the\u000d\u000a      UK's largest independent waste management company, Grundon, investing in\u000d\u000a      C8A. Grundon were looking for an alternative to the landfill disposal of\u000d\u000a      APCRs.\u000d\u000a    The significance of ACT was quickly recognised. C8S won several\u000d\u000a      prestigious awards in quick succession including the 2008 national Shell\u000d\u000a        Springboard competition, established to identify the UK's next `big\u000d\u000a      idea' in low carbon enterprise and innovation. The Shell prize\u000d\u000a      money helped paid for a pilot-scale facility to treat waste at a Kent\u000d\u000a      County Council landfill site in 2010 using the CO2 generated by\u000d\u000a      the site itself.

The `accelerated carbonation'\u000d\u000a      reaction produces solid carbonates rapidly in contrast to the slow\u000d\u000a      development of `normal' hydrated phases. Having shown that the carbon\u000d\u000a      dioxide concentration and water-to-solid ratio (w\/s) were important he\u000d\u000a      patented Accelerated Carbonation Technology (ACT). Hills saw the\u000d\u000a      opportunity to sequester significant quantities of CO2 into\u000d\u000a      solid waste streams, thereby minimising industrial emissions. The major\u000d\u000a      advance he made was the discovery that the 100% CO2 atmosphere\u000d\u000a      thought necessary to drive carbonation reactions to a rapid conclusion &#8212;\u000d\u000a      under 15 minutes, rather than the weeks or months required for natural\u000d\u000a      carbonation &#8212; was erroneous [unpublished work, due to IP considerations].\u000d\u000a      He established that lower gas concentrations as found in flue gases, are\u000d\u000a      often optimal for a rapid, substantially complete reaction, and that\u000d\u000a      optimal conditions also depend on the particle size distribution of the\u000d\u000a      waste and w\/s ratio.\u000d\u000a    Following these and other advances in waste processing, the spin-out\u000d\u000a      company Carbon8 Systems (C8S) was established in 2006 to\u000d\u000a      commercialise both ACT as a waste treatment step and the CO2\u000d\u000a      capture process. Carbon8 Aggregates (C8A) was founded in 2010\u000d\u000a      specifically to commercialise the engineering applications of the\u000d\u000a      technology to UK-derived APCR.\u000d\u000a    The first major grant, which was to research the use of ACT to treat\u000d\u000a      Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) APCRs, was received in 2002. Supported\u000d\u000a      with additional industrial funding, Hills examined the properties of\u000d\u000a      carbonated APCRs: their physical and chemical stability, including\u000d\u000a      leaching properties; and suitability either for disposal, at non-hazardous\u000d\u000a      landfill sites, or for re-use as an aggregate in construction. The\u000d\u000a      research investigated a number of UK APCRs with varying physical and\u000d\u000a      chemical characteristics, and defined the key characteristics affecting\u000d\u000a      the efficacy of carbonation and product properties. It was quickly\u000d\u000a      established that ACT is an effective treatment method, which renders the\u000d\u000a      APCRs non-hazardous and stable over long time periods. Following\u000d\u000a      substantial grant income from TSB, KTP and others, the most recent award\u000d\u000a      to Hills (&#8364;860,000) is to evaluate French and UK waste streams\u000d\u000a      for incorporation in new sustainable building materials.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4894","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described above has underpinned the development of the first\u000a      smaller-scale, modular gas-to-liquids (GTL) and biomass-to-liquids (BTL)\u000a      Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactors, launched by Oxford Catalysts Group in 2010.\u000a      Several orders for reactors have been taken; the company has attracted\u000a      very substantial investment as a result of the novel technology it offers,\u000a      and has one of the world's largest patent portfolios in this area.\u000a    After its spin-out from the University of Oxford in 2004, Oxford\u000a      Catalysts Ltd. concentrated on the creation of highly active and efficient\u000a      cobalt-based FT catalysts based on Green's research. Such was the\u000a      perceived potential of this new technology that the company's Initial\u000a      Public Offering of 2006 raised &#163; 15M and was over-subscribed. Oxford\u000a      Catalysts' patented technology, known as Organic Matrix Combustion (OMX),\u000a      allows highly active cobalt-based catalysts to be produced with a reduced\u000a      need for precious metal promoters, without any loss of performance and in\u000a      fact with superior activity, selectivity and stability to conventional\u000a      catalysts. In 2008, the company merged with Velocys, a US company\u000a      specialising in microchannel chemical reactors (using channels with\u000a      diameters in the range 0.1 - 10 mm, far smaller than those in conventional\u000a      reactors). These small channels dissipate heat more quickly than\u000a      conventional reactors so a more active catalyst can be used, and the mass\u000a      and heat transfer limitations of conventional FT reactors are overcome.\u000a      Importantly, this allowed Oxford Catalysts to take advantage of the highly\u000a      active cobalt catalysts developed by Green [6]. The use of microchannel\u000a      processing technology makes it possible to greatly intensify chemical\u000a      reactions, enabling them to occur at rates significantly higher than\u000a      conventional processes, thus enabling smaller-scale FT reactors for GTL\u000a      and BTL. The merged company became known as Oxford Catalysts Group\u000a      (re-named Velocys from September 2013) and is the only company working in\u000a      this field to maintain in-house research in both catalyst and reactor\u000a      development.\u000a    The company has capitalised on the potential of smaller and more\u000a      versatile FT reactors. Existing FT plants are huge, designed for\u000a      production levels of around 30,000 barrels of liquid fuel per day (BPD),\u000a      and cannot be scaled down economically. They require vast sources of gas,\u000a      and so are confined to a small number of locations (primarily in Qatar),\u000a      and cost billions of dollars, putting them beyond the reach of all but the\u000a      largest companies. Gas associated with oil production is usually wasted;\u000a      it is frequently disposed of by flaring (burning) - an environmentally\u000a      unfriendly process that is increasingly subject to regulation - or by\u000a      re-injection back into the reservoir at considerable expense. According to\u000a      the World Bank, 140 billion cubic meters of associated gas - enough to\u000a      power Germany - was flared in 2011. An equivalent amount or more was\u000a      re-injected simply to avoid flaring. Gas located at remote locations is\u000a      often not developed; it is not economically viable to pipe the gas to\u000a      where it is needed. Biomass resources such as agricultural and municipal\u000a      solid waste are another important potential syngas for the FT process: the\u000a      alternative being that they are disposed of as waste. Because biomass\u000a      feedstock is not very dense, it is not economic to transport it over long\u000a      distances to centralised production facilities. Therefore, BTL plants in\u000a      particular need to be relatively small and located near the source of the\u000a      feedstock. The technology developed by Oxford Catalysts Group makes it\u000a      possible to take advantage of these `wasted resources' to produce liquid\u000a      fuels by using the biomass-to-liquids (BTL) or gas-to-liquids (GTL)\u000a      processes. An added advantage is that the process creates synthetic clean\u000a      fuels free from sulphur and aromatics (unlike those produced in\u000a      conventional refinery processes), and can be tailored to produce\u000a      high-value hydrocarbons such as jet fuel [7].\u000a    Oxford Catalysts Group has demonstrated that its reactors operate\u000a      economically when producing as little as 1,000 BPD of FT products. The\u000a      reactors are small enough that modules incorporating the reactors can be\u000a      transported in standard-size shipping containers and easily delivered to\u000a      where they are needed. This has opened up the market to smaller companies,\u000a      smaller gas fields and more remote locations, enabling the distributed\u000a      production (production at or near the source of the feedstock) of clean\u000a      liquid fuels from stranded and associated gas, both on- and off-shore, and\u000a      from biomass. For example, Oxford Catalysts Group has established a\u000a      partnership with offshore-facility developers MODEC and the global\u000a      engineering firm Toyo Engineering to develop small-scale GTL facilities\u000a      based on microchannel reactors and designed for use offshore [14].\u000a    The huge potential of the reactors has generated a high level of\u000a      investment in the company. Between 2008 and the end of 2012, the group\u000a      achieved revenue of &#163; 30M and received over &#163; 60M in investment. &#163; 30.6M\u000a      of the investment was raised in January 2013, at which time Roman\u000a      Abramovich invested &#163; 4.3M in the company, generating press and television\u000a      news coverage. Oxford Catalysts' stock increased by around 200% between\u000a      June 2012 and June 2013. Throughout this period, the company has been able\u000a      to maintain its levels of employment (80 - 90 staff) in the UK and the US\u000a      [8], and has offices in the UK near Oxford and in the USA in Texas and\u000a      Ohio.\u000a    In May 2012, Oxford Catalysts announced the sale and start-up of a\u000a      commercial scale FT reactor at an integrated energy company facility [9].\u000a      The Group's technology has been selected for 4 commercial-scale projects\u000a      including:\u000a    \u000a      A 1,000 BPD commercial GTL plant for Calumet Specialty Product\u000a        Partners, L.P., a major US-based producer of speciality petroleum\u000a        products, for use in the expansion of Calumet's Karns City, Pennsylvania\u000a        facility [10].\u000a      GreenSky London waste-biomass to jet fuel commercial plant, in\u000a        partnership with BA. Like many airlines, BA is concerned about carbon\u000a        taxes and is, therefore, interested in securing a low-carbon-footprint\u000a        fuel based on biomass. The plant will provide enough fuel for BA at City\u000a        Airport [11] - reportedly 50,000 tonnes of jet fuel annually over 10\u000a        years equating to $ 500M at today's prices.\u000a      A 2,800 BPD GTL plant being developed by Pinto Energy in Ohio, USA, to\u000a        convert low-cost natural gas into high value specialty products\u000a        (solvents, lubricants and waxes), as well as ultra clean transportation\u000a        fuels [12].\u000a    \u000a    In November 2012, Oxford Catalysts Group was named as the preferred\u000a      supplier of FT technology for Ventech Engineers LLC, a global leader in\u000a      the design and construction of modular refineries. The deal raised &#163; 1.2M\u000a      for the Group, and in April 2013, Ventech placed an order worth $ 8M for\u000a      FT reactors for a plant of sufficient capacity to produce approximately\u000a      1,400 BPD. This gives an indication of the expected income from the\u000a      projects listed above. Kevin Stanley, CEO of Ventech Engineers commented,\u000a      `After an extensive search of available technologies we identified Oxford\u000a      Catalysts' FT product as the leading offering in the industry for modular\u000a      GTL plants' [13].\u000a    Oxford Catalysts Group has established collaborations for the\u000a      engineering, manufacturing and deployment of its technology with companies\u000a      such as MODEC, Toyo Engineering, Haldor Topose and Ventech. The range of\u000a      partnerships reflects the fact that Oxford Catalysts group is regarded as\u000a      a leading player in the field of FT technology [14].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out by Malcolm Green's group in the UOA led to the\u000a      spin-out of Oxford Catalysts Ltd.

Developed in Germany in the 1920s, the process was used in World War\u000a      II to enable Germany to produce liquid fuels from coal when oil was not\u000a      available, and again in South Africa where it was subject to sanctions\u000a      during the apartheid era. The production of synthetic crude via the FT\u000a      synthesis has not been adopted widely owing to the availability of cheap\u000a      oil. However concern about diminishing oil supplies, combined with an\u000a      increasing need to make use of `wasted' resources, such as gas produced\u000a      from waste biomass or the gas associated with oil production, is leading\u000a      to a renewed and growing interest in FT catalysis.\u000a    The key technology behind the catalysts used by Oxford Catalysts is the\u000a      result of nearly two decades of research at the Wolfson Catalysis Centre\u000a      (part of the University of Oxford's Department of Chemistry). The focus\u000a      has been on the use of transition-metal carbides as catalysts for the\u000a      partial oxidation of methane to syngas, and as highly active, selective\u000a      and stable FT catalysts for the conversion of syngas to synthetic crude.\u000a      This work was led by Green, the co-founder of Oxford Catalysts Ltd. who\u000a      was Head of Inorganic Chemistry at Oxford (to October 2003).\u000a    In 1993, Green reported a systematic investigation into the carbon\u000a      deposition caused by a range of transition metals acting as catalysts for\u000a      the partial oxidation of methane (POM). This built on his previous\u000a      serendipitous finding that a lanthanide ruthenium oxide catalyst gave a\u000a      remarkable 90% yield of syngas from methane via POM catalysis. Prior to\u000a      this discovery, it had been considered impossible to convert methane to\u000a      syngas in this way. Although only a thin film of carbon formed in the\u000a      process, Green was aware that carbon deposition could potentially `kill' a\u000a      catalyst and render it useless for industrial exploitation. The 1993 study\u000a      showed that nickel attracted the most carbon deposition and iridium the\u000a      least, but the ruthenium and iridium catalysts, although effective, were\u000a      too expensive for commercial use, and this prompted Green to look for\u000a      alternatives [1]. He subsequently developed less expensive, non-precious\u000a      metal, molybdenum and tungsten carbide catalysts [2, 3, 4], which,\u000a      importantly, showed no macroscopic deposition of carbon.\u000a    In 2001, Green developed a non-carbide cobalt methane oxidation catalyst\u000a      with activities comparable to noble-metal catalysts under comparable\u000a      conditions [5]. Green's research continued to develop carbide catalysts\u000a      towards industrial exploitation using micro-reactors and, in 2002, he\u000a      reported catalysts that were stable at high temperatures and pressures\u000a      using this technology [4]. The final critical development with regard to\u000a      the commercial systems currently used by Oxford Catalysts Ltd. was\u000a      described in a patent application filed in 2001 [6], in which cobalt salt\u000a      precursors to the supported active catalysts are activated in a process\u000a      involving hydrocarbon reductants. These catalysts have superior activity\u000a      and are less susceptible to deactivation over time. This method of\u000a      activation of the catalyst precursor forms a mixture of metallic cobalt\u000a      and cobalt carbides. Critically, these catalysts are not only effective\u000a      for POM, but also for FT catalysis that converts syngas into hydrocarbons\u000a      [6]. Moreover, they do not promote carbon deposition and are selective to\u000a      form hydrocarbons with five or more carbon atoms. A high selectivity is\u000a      required for an economic commercial process.\u000a    In 2004, Green spun-out the company Oxford Catalysts Ltd. with the aim of\u000a      developing a number of novel metal-carbide catalysts and catalysed\u000a      processes that could lead to marketable products based in particular on\u000a      the new FT catalyst technology.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4902","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Robinson's novel modification of Micromass' original Q-ToF mass\u000a      spectrometer, a proposal arising directly from her research needs, has\u000a      generated a new area of mass spectrometry research in industry as well as\u000a      academia, in which intact protein complexes can be studied and the\u000a      chemistry of small molecules and drugs investigated. Using earlier designs\u000a      of mass spectrometer optimised for proteomics and small-molecule drug\u000a      analysis, it was not possible to maintain the non-covalent interactions in\u000a      the gas phase since the pressure regimes and mass range of the\u000a      instrumentation were not sufficient.\u000a    The prototype instrument described in Section 2 outperformed all\u000a      anticipated specifications; the suite of initial papers that Robinson\u000a      published (including references [2] and [3], and also reported in May 2001\u000a      at the ASMS Conference [7]) contained solid evidence that the new design\u000a      could record the mass spectra of large intact molecules, and resulted in a\u000a      high level of interest from other laboratories. This, in turn, created a\u000a      demand for the modified Q-ToF mass spectrometer to be made commercially\u000a      available. The Senior Director of Mass Spectrometry Research at Micromass\u000a      UK Ltd, part of Waters Corporation, confirms that `the first [commercially\u000a      available] extended mass quadrupole units for the Q-ToF were developed in\u000a      2000, following the suggestions of Professor Robinson', and based on the\u000a      prototype tested by Robinson at Oxford University [8]. Two model classes\u000a      of mass spectrometers manufactured by Waters contain Robinson's\u000a      modification: the Q- ToF and the SYNAPT. A rival company, now AB Sciex,\u000a      also thought the new design was sufficiently commercially viable to invest\u000a      in, and manufactured their own version, the QStar, in 2006. However, only\u000a      a few QStar instruments have been sold, most likely because these were\u000a      significantly more expensive than Micromass' instruments.\u000a    Whilst initial sales of the modified mass spectrometers were confined to\u000a      academia, the research demonstrating the ability of mass spectrometry to\u000a      preserve protein complexes and to study the effects of drug binding\u000a      (including [4] above) has led to purchases by industry, notably by\u000a      pharmaceutical companies. The benefits for such customers within the\u000a      pharmaceutical industry are illustrated by the three examples below.\u000a    The biotechnology and pharmaceutical company Amgen bought their second\u000a      SYNAPT instrument in 2008 as a tool for analysing drug-like molecules. A\u000a      recent Amgen white paper confirms that the instrument's increased\u000a      quadrupole mass range allows for `mass selection, transmission and\u000a        ultimately activation and fragmentation of large protein complexes. This\u000a        fragmentation allows for protein subunit complex stoichiometry\u000a        determination, which has proven incredibly valuable if the stoichiometry\u000a        of the protein complex is unknown, or if the complex is heterogeneous'\u000a      [9]. Amgen has used ion mobility-mass spectrometry to analyze polyethylene\u000a      glycol and PEGylated polypeptides, IgG2 monoclonal antibodies and most\u000a      recently the detection of large multimeric charge-reduced protein\u000a      complexes [10]. Novo Nordisk, a global healthcare company with particular\u000a      expertise in diabetes care, has purchased a SYNAPT and used it to carry\u000a      out a joint collaborative study to monitor insulin aggregation [11]. A\u000a      senior Novo Nordisk scientist confirms that the mass spectrometer\u000a      modifications suggested by Robinson have given them `insight into the\u000a        structure and function of protein pharmaceuticals that would otherwise\u000a        be difficult or impossible to obtain' [12]. In addition, GSK is\u000a      working with Pentraxin, a spin-out company from University College London,\u000a      to develop small molecules that stabilise transthyretin, a blood protein\u000a      linked to a rare but fatal disease called amyloidosis. This research\u000a      programme has also used the modified spectrometers to perform analysis of\u000a      the macromolecules and determine the efficacy of potential inhibitors in\u000a      regulating the assembly and disassembly of transthyretin, directly\u000a      building on Robinson's demonstration that it was possible to use the new\u000a      instrumentation to study interactions within protein assemblies,\u000a      particularly in relation to the effect of drugs.\u000a    Many of these experiments are not possible on standard mass\u000a      spectrometers, since the required accuracy, resolution and pressure\u000a      regimes cannot be achieved. Thus, Robinson's modified ESI- MS design has\u000a      led to significant improvements in potential drug identification and\u000a      analysis, since multimeric drug targets can be observed intact and the\u000a      effect of potential inhibitors can consequently be revealed in an entirely\u000a      new environment.\u000a    To give an indication of the context for sales of the new mass\u000a      spectrometers, in 2012 Waters achieved net sales of over $ 1.8 billion, an\u000a      increase of 17% since 2008 [13]. 45% of these sales were of instrument\u000a      systems including its mass spectrometer range. Overall, Q-ToF and SYNAPT\u000a      instruments containing the modification proposed by Robinson constitute\u000a      about half of all Q-ToF instruments sold by the Waters Corporation [8].\u000a      There has thus been a significant impact on the commercial success of a\u000a      leading multinational instrument manufacturer, worth many millions of\u000a      dollars.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Carol Robinson's research at the University of Oxford in the mid-1990s\u000a      led directly to her proposing a new type of mass spectrometer to enable\u000a      more detailed analyses of larger molecular assemblies than previously\u000a      possible. The design is marketed worldwide by Micromass UK Ltd (part of\u000a      Waters Corporation), generating a new area of research within industry and\u000a      academia in which intact protein complexes can be analysed by mass\u000a      spectrometry and the chemistry of small molecules and drugs bound to them\u000a      investigated, thus contributing to the search for novel pharmaceuticals.\u000a      Since 2008, Waters' successful commercialisation of the new technology has\u000a      led to sales worth many millions of dollars.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    University of Oxford\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    Asterisked outputs denote best indicators of quality; University of\u000a      Oxford authors are underlined.\u000a    \u000a1.

From 1993 onwards, Robinson has used\u000a      electrospray-ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to decipher protein\u000a      structure and function. Research by Robinson and colleagues in 1994\u000a      investigated GroEL, a molecular chaperone that catalyses protein-folding,\u000a      by directly monitoring its hydrogen exchange kinetics [1]. This work\u000a      provided new insights into the GroEL mechanism, and supported the\u000a      potential of ESI-MS for studying non-covalent protein complexes.\u000a      Importantly, it showed that large protein assemblies (800 kDa) could be\u000a      transferred intact into a vacuum even though they were not\u000a      directly detected by the existing MS instruments. Quadrupole\u000a      time-of-flight (Q-ToF) mass spectrometers (in which an ion's\u000a      mass-to-charge ratio (m\/z) is determined via a time measurement)\u000a      could not directly detect the intact complexes because the high m\/z\u000a      ratio of large molecules was beyond the operating limits of commercial\u000a      quadrupoles. Two specific instrument advances were required for the large\u000a      complexes to be analysed; first, there needed to be improved transmission\u000a      of high-mass molecules through Q-ToF mass spectrometers, and second there\u000a      needed to be improved selectivity between ions with high m\/z\u000a      values.\u000a    In 1998, Robinson approached Micromass UK Ltd, who had launched their\u000a      Q-ToF mass spectrometer in 1996, with a proposal to modify the instrument\u000a      to enable more detailed investigation of the molecular system outlined in\u000a      her 1994 paper. Proof-of-principle research using prototype and\u000a      home-improvements on commercial instruments was performed, revealing that\u000a      transmission of very large protein assemblies was possible, including\u000a      GroEL (800 kDa) [2] , ribosomes (2.3 MDa) [3], and a virus (2.5 MDa). The\u000a      virus analysis demonstrated that 180 protein subunits could remain intact\u000a      during flight through the mass spectrometer and be dissociated to give\u000a      monomeric units and assemblies, thus indicating that the packing of other\u000a      viruses could be addressed using ESI-MS. The mass spectra of intact\u000a      ribosomes revealed that not only the 70S particle but also the 30S and 50S\u000a      complexes could be observed with charge-state resolution. These findings\u000a      had huge consequences since, at the time, preservation of non-covalent\u000a      interactions in such large complexes was completely unexpected. This key\u000a      step towards obtaining mass spectra of intact protein complexes was\u000a      achieved on both time-of-flight (ToF) and Q-ToF instruments by making\u000a      adjustments to collisional cooling (via the differential pressure regimes)\u000a      in the instrument, reducing the internal energy of the complexes and hence\u000a      reducing their tendency to fragment. A patent for this method was filed in\u000a      2000 [4].\u000a    The second aspect of Robinson's instrumentation conceived at Oxford was\u000a      to reduce the radio- frequency of the guiding field applied to the\u000a      quadrupole. She was confident that this would optimise analysis of\u000a      macromolecular complexes, and better exploit the ability of ESI-MS to\u000a      preserve interactions between proteins and other molecules in the gas\u000a      phase. The quadrupole frequency was reduced such that an m\/z value\u000a      of 32,000 could be isolated and transmitted. This was the first time that\u000a      such a modification had been made to a Q-ToF instrument, and it was\u000a      considered to be high-risk; it was not clear to Micromass, or others, that\u000a      sufficient mass resolution would be achieved with a lower frequency\u000a      quadrupole. Initially, therefore, they produced only one mass spectrometer\u000a      for Robinson's use, delivered to her Oxford laboratory in December 2000.\u000a    The first research results from the prototype instrument, obtained in\u000a      Oxford in early 2001 and first reported in May 2001 at the 49th\u000a      ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics (Chicago,\u000a      Illinois), showed unequivocally that intact macromolecular assemblies\u000a      could be maintained and transmitted through the mass spectrometer, their\u000a      masses measured with high accuracy using the new low-frequency quadrupole,\u000a      and their overall topology examined. It was evident that with Robinson's\u000a      innovative modification ESI-MS could now be used to analyse not just small\u000a      proteins and modest non-covalent complexes but also macromolecular\u000a      assemblies with masses as large as 1,000,000 Da.\u000a    In 2008, while at Cambridge, Robinson found that by releasing a\u000a      membrane-protein complex from a detergent micelle transported into the gas\u000a      phase, she could record the mass spectrum of an intact membrane-protein\u000a      complex, further supporting the initial proposal made at Oxford in 1998.\u000a      Unexpectedly, these complexes also carried with them specifically bound\u000a      lipid molecules. After Robinson returned to Oxford in 2009 she developed\u000a      this research to show the consequences of lipid binding to\u000a      membrane-embedded complexes [5]. This work is particularly important for\u000a      the discovery of new drugs, since many drugs target membrane-bound\u000a      proteins and lipid binding can either prevent the entry of drugs into the\u000a      cell or adapt the cavity for drug recognition.\u000a    Robinson continues to pursue cutting-edge research into drug binding to a\u000a      broad range of membrane-protein complexes. Research published in 2013\u000a      again used ESI-MS to study the binding in P-gp, a membrane-embedded pump\u000a      which is responsible for clearing xenotoxins from the cell.\u000a      Over-expression of P-gp in tumour cells impairs targeted drug delivery,\u000a      since the pump recognises chemotherapeutics as toxins and exports them.\u000a      Robinson and colleagues were able to probe the effect of a combination of\u000a      drugs and lipids on the equilibrium in P-gp and detect independent and\u000a      simultaneous binding, with important consequences for studying drug\u000a      binding in general [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5577","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The new AVADA catalyst developed by BP (EP0757027, 1997) consists of a\u000d      bed of silica beads impregnated with silicotungstic HPA. The catalyst\u000d      showed excellent initial activity in the synthesis of ethyl acetate, but\u000d      unfortunately deactivated very quickly and with irreversible loss of\u000d      activity. The main cause of deactivation was extensive catalyst coking\u000d      which blocked catalyst acid sites leading to the loss of acidity. As a\u000d      result, the catalyst life was too short to be economically viable, which\u000d      put the AVADA project at risk of closure.\u000d    Kozhevnikov made the crucial suggestion of an alternative approach to the\u000d      problem of catalyst deactivation, viz prevention of catalyst coking and\u000d      poisoning by adding n-donors to the reaction feed, rather than attempting\u000d      a `cure' (regeneration). Kozhevnikov demonstrated that addition of water\u000d      to the olefin feedstock was an extremely effective coke inhibitor over HPA\u000d      catalysts (Appl. Catal. A 214, 47-58 (2001)).\u000d    Based on these results, the first advance implemented was co-feeding 3-8%\u000d      of water (steam) together with ethylene and acetic acid to the catalytic\u000d      reactor. This reduced dramatically the amount of coke deposited on the\u000d      catalyst surface. It also improved the stability of the heteropoly acid on\u000d      the silica surface. The second measure developed was the installation of a\u000d      silico-alumina guard bed to protect the HPA catalyst from poisoning by\u000d      basic impurities in the feed and corrosion metal ions. Altogether these\u000d      measures, originating from collaborative research between Kozhevnikov's\u000d      group and BP Chemicals, allowed significant prolongation of catalyst life\u000d      to about one year and were crucial to the commercial success of the AVADA\u000d      process.\u000d    The ethyl acetate plant at Hull achieved continuous sustained operation\u000d      during its first year in commercial production. The purity of the product\u000d      was excellent - 99.98%, the best ever. The low volatility of the HPA\u000d      helped the catalyst to survive the reactor's extremes of heat and\u000d      pressure, thus allowing long periods of uninterrupted operation for the\u000d      plant. Interestingly, the HPA catalyst, which is now produced by Johnson\u000d      Matthey, is practically unchanged from the one used in the initial stage\u000d      of process development. It is the implementation of the right process\u000d      conditions, based on fundamental research, that has made the great\u000d      improvement to the process efficiency.\u000d    Regarding its environmental friendliness, the AVADA process is by far\u000d      ahead of conventional ethyl acetate syntheses (Green Chemistry,\u000d      2003, 5, G78-C81; DOI: 10.1039\/b304290c). Traditional ethanol\u000d      esterification units produce as much water as they do ethyl acetate and\u000d      therefore require treatment and disposal of this waste stream. In the\u000d      AVADA process, elimination of ethanol as intermediate eliminated the\u000d      transport of some 60,000 tonnes of ethanol by road and removed more than\u000d      100,000 tonnes p.a. of wastewater stream. The other main technology in the\u000d      market, Tischenko condensation, uses an acetaldehyde feedstock. This is\u000d      less efficient than producing ethyl acetate directly from a modern\u000d      ethylene cracker and also produces waste streams from the aluminium salts\u000d      used as catalyst. Compared to conventional processes, AVADA's energy\u000d      consumption is about 20% lower and feedstock losses are some 35% less than\u000d      in conventional esterification with benefits to CO2 emissions (Green\u000a        Chemistry, 2003, 5, G78-C81).\u000d    The AVADA technology is potentially interesting for other acid-catalysed\u000d      processes such as the manufacturing of fuels, detergents and lubricants\u000d      using heterogeneous acid catalysis. The AVADA process won the AstraZeneca\u000d      Award in Green Chemistry and Engineering in 2002 (Green Chemistry,\u000d      5, G78-C81 (2003)).\u000d    In 2008, BP sold the ethyl acetate and related vinyl acetate monomer\u000d      businesses to INEOS Enterprise, a Swiss headquartered petrochemical group,\u000d      for an undisclosed amount. At that time each facility had 250,000 tonnes\u000d      p.a. capacity and together employed around 40 people (www.knak.jp\/big\/ineos.htm).\u000d    According to the recent ICIS Chemical Business report (October 2011), the\u000d      INEOS (former BP) plant at Hull (245,000 tonnes p.a. production capacity,\u000d      $340m p.a. factory gate value) by far dominates ethyl acetate production\u000d      in Europe (56% of the total 440,000 tonnes p.a.), being the second largest\u000d      in the world after the Zhenjiang 270,000 tonnes p.a. capacity ethyl\u000d      acetate plant in China (http:\/\/www.icis.com\/Articles\/2011\/10\/24\/9501870\/european+chemical+profile+ethyl+acetate.html).\u000d    Over the REF period from 2008 to 2013, the AVADA process produced 1.2\u000d      million tonnes of ethyl acetate of the total value of $1.7 billion and\u000d      reduced the wastewater stream by 0.5 million tonnes compared to the\u000d      conventional ethanol esterification process.\u000d    In his letter of corroboration, Dr Mark Howard, Technology Vice\u000d      President, Conversion Technology Centre, BP International Ltd., Saltend,\u000d      Hull, states \"Kozhevnikov's group, in close cooperation with BP's team\u000d        at Sunbury, set out to investigate coking and regeneration of HPA\u000d        catalysts.

Recently sold to INEOS\u000d        as part of BP's rationalisation of its portfolio, the AVADA plant is\u000d        still in operation.\"\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    Studies into the deactivation and regeneration of heteropoly acid\u000d      catalysts, which took place in the group of Professor Ivan Kozhevnikov at\u000d      Liverpool University since 1996, resulted in the large-scale industrial\u000d      application of these catalysts in BP's process for the synthesis of the\u000d      widely used solvent ethyl acetate, thus making significant economic and\u000d      environmental impact. This process, trademarked AVADA (for AdVanced\u000a      Acetates by Direct Addition of acetic acid to\u000d      ethylene), was launched in 2001 at Hull, UK, on a scale of 220,000 tonnes\u000d      p.a., then the world's largest ethyl acetate production plant. The impact\u000d      continued through the REF period from 2008 to 2013. In October 2011, the\u000d      AVADA process produced 56% of the ethyl acetate in Europe (245,000 tonnes\u000d      p.a. production capacity and $340m p.a. factory gate value), being the\u000d      second largest in the world after the Zhenjiang 270,000 tonnes p.a. ethyl\u000d      acetate plant in China. Over the REF period, the AVADA process produced\u000d      1.2 million tonnes of ethyl acetate worth $1.7 billion. The AVADA process\u000d      makes ethyl acetate with 100% atom efficiency, avoiding the use of ethanol\u000d      as an intermediate. It beats conventional processes in environmental\u000d      friendliness by reducing energy consumption by 20% and feedstock losses by\u000d      35%, thus removing more than 100,000 tonnes p.a. of wastewater stream.

Systematic studies of HPA catalysts at the molecular\u000d      level have led to a series of large-scale industrial applications, such as\u000d      the hydration of olefins and the oxidation of methacrolein to methacrylic\u000d      acid. Prof. Kozhevnikov is a world-leading expert in catalysis by HPAs; he\u000d      became involved with HPA catalysis early on, since the mid-1970s, and\u000d      published over 150 widely recognized research outputs in this field,\u000d      including the pioneering work on acid catalysis by HPAs (Kozhevnikov,\u000d      I.V., Chemical Reviews, 98, 171-198 (1998); J.

The majority of HPA catalytic\u000d      applications use the most stable and easy available Keggin HPAs comprising\u000d      heteropolyanions of the formula [XM12O ]n-, where X\u000d      is the heteroatom (e.g. P5+, Si4+) and M is the 40\u000d      addendum atom (e.g. Mo6+, W6+). HPAs are\u000d      non-volatile compounds possessing very strong Br&#248;nsted acidity which is\u000d      superior to that of mineral acids and conventional solid acid catalysts.\u000d      This makes them promising solid acid catalysts for various reactions both\u000d      in gas and liquid phases. However, the relatively low thermal stability of\u000d      HPAs and difficulty of catalyst regeneration had always been obstacles to\u000d      their commercialisation, rendering their use in heterogeneous acid\u000d      catalysis rather limited. The key problem was catalyst lifetime, since the\u000d      heteropoly acids usually suffered rapid deactivation and loss of activity.\u000d    In the 1990s, BP Chemicals were facing the challenge of relocating ethyl\u000d      acetate manufacturing capacity around Europe to a more efficient site, by\u000d      implementing a significantly improved production process. Ethyl acetate is\u000d      manufactured on a large scale and is used in surface coatings, inks, and\u000d      pharmaceuticals. The state-of-the-art BP site at Hull was chosen as the\u000d      new location for the commercial plant.\u000d    BP Chemicals came up with a new solution for ethyl acetate production,\u000d      trademarked AVADA. The new technology converts ethylene and acetic acid in\u000d      the gas phase with 100% atom efficiency directly into ethyl acetate using\u000d      a highly active HPA catalyst, without the usual intermediate stage of\u000d      esterification which would have required another feedstock chemical,\u000d      ethanol. By avoiding ethanol the new technology represents a significant\u000d      advance &#8212; a true step change. Exploratory work on the AVADA process was\u000d      carried out at BP Sunbury-on-Thames Research Centre by the team led by Dr\u000d      Martin Atkins and at BP Research and Technology Centre at Hull by the\u000d      technology team led by Dr Mark Howard. Their progress was hampered by the\u000d      short catalyst lifetime due to fast deactivation of the HPA catalyst\u000d      caused by its coking and poisoning.\u000d    In 1996, Kozhevnikov, then Senior Research Fellow in the Leverhulme\u000d      Centre for Innovative Catalysis (LCIC), Department of Chemistry,\u000d      University of Liverpool, was invited by BP Chemicals, an Industrial\u000d      Affiliate with the LCIC at that time, to collaborate with their team at\u000d      Sunbury on the development of the HPA catalyst for the AVADA process.\u000d      Kozhevnikov set up a research group in Liverpool, which included two\u000d      PDRA's, Dr S. Holmes and Dr M. R. H. Siddiqui, funded by BP Chemicals. The\u000d      aim of their research was to gain an insight into the nature of the coke\u000d      formed on the surface of supported HPA catalysts and the effect of the\u000d      coke on the HPA. This was investigated using 13C and 31P\u000d      solid state NMR, XPS and TPO\/TGA in combination with fixed-bed reactor\u000d      studies of aerobic coke gasification. It was found that catalyst\u000d      modification with platinum group metals, such as palladium, significantly\u000d      reduced the temperature of coke removal to allow for catalyst regeneration\u000d      without HPA degradation (Catal. Lett. 66, 53-57 (2000)).\u000d      Particularly important was the finding that addition of polar molecules\u000d      (n-donors) such as water, methanol etc. to the feed could greatly reduce\u000d      coking of HPA catalysts thus improving catalyst life without the need for\u000d      frequent catalyst regeneration (Appl. Catal.A 214, 47-58\u000d      (2001)).\u000d    The result of this collaborative research was the development of\u000d      effective methods to improve the stability and lifetime of the HPA\u000d      catalysts. These processes include both prevention of catalyst coking as\u000d      well as regeneration of HPA catalysts. The main results of these studies\u000d      have been published in the papers listed below.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6327","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context: Dental decay is the most common of all diseases\u000a      (prevalence: ~10% of the population p.a. in the western world i.e. 100\u000a      million lesions p.a.), yet the principles of treatment have remained\u000a      unchanged for almost 100 years (J. Dent. 2003, 31,\u000a      395-405). Most adults worldwide suffer from dental caries (tooth decay),\u000a      many of which go untreated because of patients' fear of the dental drill.\u000a      The earliest sign of tooth decay is the \"white spot\" lesion, visible to\u000a      the clinician on the tooth surface. There is no current consensus view\u000a      regarding treatment, and clinicians have three choices: (a) to monitor the\u000a      lesion, and then to excavate and fill; (b) to apply fluoride treatments,\u000a      and then to proceed as in (a); and (c) to place a small restoration.\u000a      Ultimately, all restorations fail and need to be replaced with larger\u000a      fillings, and will eventually lead to tooth loss and replacement.\u000a      Treatment currently costs the UK NHS ca &#163;2bn pa (roughly half the\u000a      budget for dental care; Office of the Government Auditor). Drilling is\u000a      feared by many patients, inhibiting their attendance at the dentist and so\u000a      precluding opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment of decay as\u000a      well as diseases such as oral cancer. Leeds' self-assembling peptide\u000a      technology provides a simple and cost-effective alternative to current\u000a      treatments that avoids a subsequent need for larger fillings; this\u000a      technology removes the clinician's dilemma of whether to treat decay, and\u000a      removes the need for drilling and thus the fear of visiting the dentist.\u000a    Societal impact\u000a      Public interest was stimulated through promotional material from\u000a      EPSRC; in a story featuring Prof. Kirkham on Channel 4 News; and in an\u000a      article in the Daily Mail (A).\u000a    Economic impacts\u000a      A company was established (\"Credentis AG\", Switzerland;\u000a      www.credentis.com) in January 2010, in which the University of Leeds is a\u000a      major stakeholder, to exploit under license Leeds' IP on self- assembling\u000a      peptides in the dental domain (B,C). Jobs have been created for\u000a      highly-skilled researchers at both Credentis in Switzerland (2010, 0.5\u000a      FTEs; 2011, 2 FTEs; 2012, 3 FTEs; 2013, 4 FTEs) and at the University of\u000a      Leeds (3 FTEs in 2013) (C). In its first two years of operation, the\u000a      company has raised external investment of ca 4.75M Swiss\u000a      francs (ca &#163;3M) in three rounds (2010, 0.25M CHF; 2011, 2.5M CHF;\u000a      2013, 2.0M CHF) (C).\u000a    Leeds' IP has enabled the adoption of disruptive technology\u000a      within dental care. The platform technology for self assembling peptide\u000a      design developed in Leeds was patented (D, currently maintained), and\u000a      underpins diverse applications including the design of biomimetic\u000a      scaffolds in tissue engineering. Following Leeds research using self\u000a      assembling peptide technology to treat decay lesions in extracted teeth,\u000a      an applications patent was granted in 2009 (E) and is currently\u000a      maintained. Subsequent Leeds research comparing the ability of different\u000a      peptide designs to nucleate mineral crystals and to regenerate bone led to\u000a      the filing of a patent in the US (F).\u000a    Credentis was recognised as one of the top 100 Swiss start-up companies\u000a      in 2011, 2012 and 2013 (http:\/\/www.startup.ch\/index.cfm?CFID=241786181&amp;CFTOKEN=45081364&amp;page=129572&amp;profilesEntr\u000a        y=1) by a panel of start-up company experts in conjunction with\u000a      Handelszeitung. In 2012, Credentis opened at UK office in Leeds,\u000a      reflecting the continuing close collaboration with researchers in the\u000a      University. Support for this collaborative research programme includes a\u000a      new &#163;1.2M award via the Leeds EPSRC Medical Technologies Innovation and\u000a      Knowledge Centre (EP\/I019103\/1) to develop second-generation peptides for\u000a      further dental applications to increase the Credentis product range (G).\u000a      Leeds researchers (Aggeli, Kirkham) are developing new technology and\u000a      minimising commercial risk via the provision of access to a full and\u000a      validated pipeline screening facility including (a) rational peptide\u000a      design; (b) characterisation of self-assembly processes; (c) computational\u000a      modelling; (d) theology testing; (e) screening for capacity to induce\u000a      mineralisation; (f) cytotoxicity testing; (g) in situ (ex vivo)\u000a      testing; (h) clinical trials; and (i) process development.\u000a    A new product (initially CurodontTM, and now CurodontTM\u000a        Repair (H)) containing peptide P11-4, based on patents of Leeds\u000a      researchers, was granted its CE certificate in January 2012 (C) and has\u000a      now entered the European market for clinical use as a class IIa medical\u000a      device; the product has also been approved for clinical use in Australia,\u000a      and Health Canada approval is pending. Large scale production of CurodontTM\u000a        provides a fully GMP-compliant product (50,000 patient treatments\u000a      in the first run) for which patient acceptability has been shown to be\u000a      very high. Leeds researchers contributed to this outcome by conducting\u000a      first in man safety trials for P11-4, demonstrating a clear clinical\u000a      improvement over treatment of class 5 lesions with the peptide (6). The\u000a      product has been launched in Germany and Switzerland in Q1\/2013. Credentis\u000a      has engaged a UK dental specialist company, Optident, who will distribute\u000a      and supply the products within the UK market from October 2013 (I). A\u000a      second product, Curodont&#8482; Protect, was approved(H) in April 2013, is\u000a      regulated as a cosmetic and has been launched in selected markets in 2013;\u000a      here, the formulation of the peptide has been adapted for the treatment of\u000a      dentin hypersensitivity and the prevention of tooth decay.\u000a    There has been significant investment in research and development\u000a      of this peptide technology (including P11-4) by overseas industry. In\u000a      addition to support from Credentis AG (G), a collaborative project with\u000a      Geistlich Biomaterials (Switzerland) demonstrated that self-assembling\u000a      peptides can promote highly efficient bone regeneration in an animal\u000a      model.\u000a    Health impact\u000a      A new clinical intervention - a medical device for restoration of\u000a      early enamel caries - has been developed, trialled in patients and a\u000a      definite positive outcome demonstrated (6). Leeds researchers were\u000a      involved in all stages of the product development from laboratory to\u000a      chairside (C). The resulting marketed products launched in 2013 are seen\u000a      by the profession to fill the previously unfilled gap between prevention\u000a      and surgical intervention (J).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A new class of synthetic self-assembling peptides has been developed at\u000a      Leeds into a product that allows the enamel in the dental cavities to be\u000a      regenerated. The peptides assemble to form gels that have been shown to be\u000a      promising biocompatible materials with applications in regenerative\u000a      medicine, for example in the regeneration of bone. Credentis AG\u000a      (Switzerland) was founded in January 2010 to commercialise the technology\u000a      in the dental care domain. Its first product Curodont&#8482; Repair - the first\u000a      product of its kind in dental care - has completed first-in-man safety\u000a      trials (also at Leeds); has received regulatory approval for clinical use\u000a      in Switzerland, Europe and Australia; and was launched in Switzerland and\u000a      Germany in Q1\/2013.

Aggeli, Spectroscopic\u000a        studies of self-assembling peptides in solution and in lipid bilayers,\u000a      PhD thesis, University of Leeds, 1995). Subsequently, supported by EPSRC,\u000a      Aggeli and Boden, together with Fishwick, Radford (Faculty of\u000a      Biological Sciences) and McLeish (School of Physics), established (between\u000a      1995 and 2003) the underlying principles required for peptide\u000a      self-assembly into nanotapes and gels (1); a theoretical framework to\u000a      explain the experimental behaviour of self-assembled peptides (2); and the\u000a      principles to design in responsiveness to external triggers in order to\u000a      control the assembly process (3). Under specific conditions, peptides\u000a      undergo hierarchical self-assembly through formation of micrometer-long\u000a      f062-sheet \"nanotapes\", which stack in pairs to form ribbons, further\u000a      assemble to form fibrils, and then entwine to form fibres. This assembly\u000a      process is principally driven by intermolecular hydrogen bonding between\u000a      peptide backbones, together with additional interactions between specific\u000a      backbones, and offered the potential for a new generation of biomaterials\u000a      with many different applications. This research was described in three\u000a      seminal papers(1-3) in high-impact journals that have collectively accrued\u000a      over 1100 citations.\u000a    Kirkham's group [funded from 1998 through Wellcome Trust programme and\u000a      project grants (088908\/Z\/09\/Z) and BBSRC (9709001; ABY08147; REI18424)\u000a      equipment grants] utilised enamel development as a paradigm for\u000a      understanding how extracellular matrix proteins control crystal\u000a      nucleation, disposition and tissue architecture in mammalian\u000a      biomineralisation. This research established the principles that underpin\u000a      the control of crystal growth in developing enamel, leading to the\u000a      hypothesis that domains of negative charge on extracellular matrix\u000a      proteins were responsible for crystal nucleation during enamel\u000a      biomineralisation (4).\u000a    Kirkham and Aggeli's collaboration since 2003 has used the knowledge of\u000a      the structure-function relationships of self-assembling peptides and the\u000a      mechanism of mineralised tissue formation to address clinical challenges\u000a      in dental cavity healing. Peptides were selected that would be monomeric\u000a      at pH &gt;7.5, providing a low viscosity, injectible fluid that would\u000a      spontaneously assemble to form a three-dimensional fibrillar scaffold\u000a      under physiological conditions. In addition, the peptides were designed to\u000a      provide, via their amino acid side chains, domains of negative charge once\u000a      assembled.

PDT requires the\u000a      combination of light and a photosensitiser drug to achieve a therapeutic\u000a      effect; the mechanism involves absorption of light by the photosensitiser,\u000a      activation of molecular oxygen by the excited photosensitiser, and damage\u000a      by the resulting highly reactive singlet oxygen leading to cell death. The\u000a      need for a light source ensures that the process can be targeted precisely\u000a      to the site of disease. This funding supported research by Griffiths and\u000a      his colleagues to develop synthetic methods for the systematic preparation\u000a      of water-soluble photosensitising dyes including phenothiaziniums(1) and\u000a      phthalocyanines (2,3) In parallel with these synthetic studies, between\u000a      1996 and 2001, Brown's research group carried out experiments to evaluate\u000a      the cellular uptake and in vitro photodynamic activity of these\u000a      compounds for potential applications as anticancer or antimicrobial\u000a      agents.\u000a    The collaborative team demonstrated the value of the novel\u000a      photosensitisers as photoactivatable antimicrobial agents, and optimised\u000a      their activity. Bacteria can be classified into two broad groups - Gram\u000a      positive and Gram negative bacteria - and dangerous pathogens are found in\u000a      both classes. Although it was well known that some photosensitising dyes\u000a      were active against Gram positive bacteria, none had previously been found\u000a      active against Gram negative bacteria. The novel photosensitisers are\u000a      active against Gram negative bacteria, Gram positive bacteria (including\u000a      antibiotic resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus\u000a        Aureus, MRSA) and fungi. Research conducted at Leeds showed that\u000a      both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria could be killed provided\u000a      that the photosensitiser was cationic (4). Through a process of systematic\u000a      structural modification, with parallel in vitro and in vivo\u000a      screening, detailed structure-activity relationships were established.\u000a      Specific phenothiaziniums, with far superior antibacterial activities\u000a      compared to other known photosensitisers, were discovered, including the\u000a      subsequent candidate agent PPA904 (5). A crucial advantage of these\u000a      compounds, which made them suitable for treating infected tissue, was\u000a      their highly selective uptake by bacteria compared to mammalian cells.\u000a    This intellectual property was transferred to the University spin-out\u000a      company Photopharmica Limited and followed up by a range of national and\u000a      regional applications. Photopharmica was established in 2001 to continue\u000a      the clinical development of the candidate agent PPA904. The class of\u000a      photosensitising dyes were patent protected worldwide through a patent\u000a      cooperation treaty (PCT) application (5), with Brown and O'Grady as named\u000a      inventors.\u000a    Phase IIa clinical trial\u000a      The first clinical trial, funded by Photopharmica, focused on the\u000a      treatment of chronic infected leg and foot ulcers; it took place in 2004\u000a      under the `DDX' (`Doctors and Dentists Exemption') rules which allowed\u000a      clinicians to use the experimental therapy on a named patient basis. This\u000a      DDX study involved nine patients, and led to regulatory approval of a\u000a      Phase IIa clinical trial.

Early\u000a      toxicity testing can prevent the costs associated with unnecessary R&amp;D\u000a      and the late failure of drug candidates.\u000a    Universally accepted by regulators\u000a      In 2008 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidance on \"a\u000a        variety of ways to characterize and reduce the potential lifetime cancer\u000a        risk associated with patient exposure to genotoxic and carcinogenic\u000a        impurities both during clinical development and after approval.\"\u000a      Derek Nexus is specifically cited as a recommended prediction tool to\u000a      inform decision-making (A). Although a number of methods are mentioned\u000a      alongside Derek Nexus for this initial toxicity evaluation, in practice,\u000a      the use of Derek Nexus by large pharmaceutical companies is effectively\u000a      universal (B). In a survey of eight leading pharmaceutical companies in\u000a      2012, Derek Nexus was the method of choice for all eight companies in\u000a      assessing genotoxic risk; in half of cases, Derek Nexus was the only\u000a      commercial product used (C). An article from 2013 co-authored by\u000a      representatives from 15 companies confirms the on-going value of Derek\u000a      Nexus in the drug development process (D). Changes to guidelines have\u000a        been informed and the pharmaceutical sector has adopted\u000a      Derek Nexus as a tool for toxicology prediction.\u000a    Faster to market to increase revenues\u000a      The universal application (C,D) of the Derek Nexus system between 2008 and\u000a      2013 derives from its excellent success rate in identifying structures\u000a      that represent a genotoxicity risk and providing supporting evidence for\u000a      its assertions (C,D). The success of Derek Nexus has embedded the software\u000a      in the workflow industry-wide as a means of reducing costly and\u000a      time consuming experimental evaluation. An article co-authored by\u000a      representatives from 13 major pharmaceutical companies explains how Derek\u000a      Nexus can accelerate the development process, whilst still ensuring the\u000a      regulatory requirements to ensure patient safety are met; the article\u000a      places the success of in silico approaches (judged using the\u000a      industry-accepted negative prediction value) at 94%, which increases to\u000a      99% with interpretation by an expert user (Regulatory Toxicology and\u000a        Pharmacology, 2006, 44, 198-211).\u000a    One pharmaceutical company shared some experiences of two development\u000a      programmes that led to launched products over a 5-year period before the\u000a      industry-wide acceptance of toxicology prediction tools. In each\u000a      programme, the regulatory authorities raised concerns about the\u000a      genotoxicity profile of a low level impurity, leading to a 1-3 month delay\u000a      while the safety of the impurity was established experimentally. In each\u000a      case, a Derek Nexus-based assessment would have been negative, and would\u000a      have avoided any delay. As it was, based on a conservative estimate of the\u000a      delay (1 month) and a conservative estimate of the annual sales figure for\u000a      the launched products during their patent period of exclusivity (each\u000a      &#163;200M), the use of Derek Nexus, now embedded in current practice, would\u000a      have increased revenues by &#163;30M. If this scenario is common to all large\u000a      pharmaceutical companies, then the increased revenues across the sector\u000a      over a 5-year period (using a conservative scaling factor of five-fold)\u000a      can be estimated at &#163;150M. The Director of Computational Toxicology at\u000a      GlaxoSmithKline corroborated in 2012 that the impact of embedding\u000a      prediction tools (in particular Derek Nexus) for genotoxicity in current\u000a      practice was broadly in line with his experience and a realistic\u000a      assessment for the sector as a whole (E). The performance of a sector\u000a        was thus improved.\u000a    Reduced costs during development\u000a      The embedding of predictive toxicity tools has also had a significant\u000a        bearing on cost and resource. Each year, on average, a major\u000a      pharmaceutical company might perform 100 Derek Nexus screens on impurities\u000a      to adhere to regulatory guidelines for genotoxic impurities. Of these, a\u000a      significant proportion (&gt;50%) will generate a clean signal and, as a\u000a      result, development can proceed without further safety testing. In the\u000a      absence of a reliable predictive tool embedded in industry practice,\u000a      experimental screening would require substantial resource for synthesis,\u000a      purification, analysis and testing. Assuming an FTE rate of &#163;100K, and\u000a      applying a conservative resource requirement of 0.25 FTE-year, a cost\u000a      saving of &#163;25K per example can be estimated. Scaling for 50 clean signals\u000a      per year, and applying a conservative scaling factor for the industry of\u000a      5-fold, this corresponds to an estimated cost saving of &#163;30M over a five\u000a      year period. The Director of Computational Toxicology at GlaxoSmithKline\u000a      corroborated in 2012 that the impact of embedding toxicology prediction\u000a      tools (in particular Derek Nexus) in current practice was broadly in line\u000a      with his experience and a realistic assessment for the sector as a whole\u000a      (E).\u000a    Employment and revenue\u000a      Lhasa Ltd. is a not-for-profit company (and a registered charity) and is\u000a      responsible for the continued support of cheminformatic research\u000a      undertaken at the University of Leeds in support of its charitable aims.\u000a      There are currently 254 organisations who are members of Lhasa Ltd.,\u000a      including all of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies in the world (F).\u000a    In 2005, the research capacity supporting Lhasa Ltd's development had\u000a      grown substantially, and the staff left the employment of the University\u000a      and became employees of Lhasa Ltd.

This not-for-profit charity and company limited\u000a      by guarantee, in which Johnson was a Director, was initially formed to\u000a      develop tools, based on `Logic and Heuristics Applied to Synthetic\u000a      Analysis' (LHASA), that could automatically identify synthetic routes to\u000a      complex organic molecules. Lhasa Ltd. secured subscriptions from a wide\u000a      range of members from industry which was deployed by Johnson to fund\u000a      academic research at the University of Leeds.\u000a    A member of Lhasa, Schering Agrochemicals, realised that adaptations to\u000a      the LHASA approach could create a knowledge-based system to predict the\u000a      toxic hazard of organic chemicals. An early prototype known as DEREK was\u000a      developed in 1986 in collaboration between Lhasa UK Ltd. and Schering\u000a      Agrochemicals. An account of the development of the Derek prototype has\u000a      been published (Chapter 9 in \"Knowledge-Based Expert Systems in\u000a      Chemistry\", P. Judson, RSC Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Series\u000a      No. 1, RSC Publishing, Cambridge, 2009. ISBN: 978-0-85404-160-2).\u000a    Underpinning research to develop Derek Nexus into a mature system\u000a      Academic research undertaken by researchers at the University of Leeds\u000a      between 1993 and 2005 enabled DEREK (subsequently Derek for Windows and\u000a      now, Derek Nexus) to be developed into a mature system that is accepted\u000a      industry-wide.\u000a    A key study was undertaken by Long in collaboration with FRAME\u000a      (Fund for the Replacement of Animals in Medical Experiments) to evaluate\u000a      the viability of Derek's approach for toxicity prediction. Tested with a\u000a      panel of food-based carcinogens and mutagens, the potential of the system\u000a      was demonstrated, whilst also highlighting the need to enhance reliability\u000a      through exploitation of larger experimental datasets (1). This study\u000a      highlighted the accuracy and reliability of Derek for industry and drove a\u000a      new phase of the model's refinement.\u000a    Research undertaken between 1993 and 1996 led to a refined model with\u000a      improved predictive capabilities, particularly in the areas of\u000a      genotoxicity and skin sensitisation (2).

Action to manage and improve air quality\u000d\u000a      in the UK is largely driven by EU legislation. The 2008 ambient air\u000d\u000a      quality directive sets legally binding limits for concentrations\u000d\u000a      in outdoor air of major air pollutants that impact public health. The EU\u000d\u000a      also sets national emissions ceilings. VOC oxidation, to form ozone and\u000d\u000a      secondary particulate matter (PM), presents particular problems because of\u000d\u000a      its long range and therefore transnational nature. The Head of the Air\u000d\u000a      Quality Programme at Defra (Department for Environment, Food and Rural\u000d\u000a      Affairs) (2005-2010) (previously, Head of the Air Quality Science Unit,\u000d\u000a      Defra, 1993-2005) stated that \"The MCM formed the core of the modelling\u000d\u000a        research to inform policy related to ozone in Defra. As part of the PTM\u000d\u000a        (Photochemical Trajectory Model), and as a benchmark against which other\u000d\u000a        mechanisms were evaluated, it played a crucial role in ensuring that the\u000d\u000a        UK's policy positions were founded on the basis of the best available\u000d\u000a        science, on EU Directives such as the National Emissions Ceilings\u000d\u000a        Directive and the Solvent Emissions Directive and the UNECE `Gothenburg\u000d\u000a        Protocol'. Over the period during which Defra supported the MCM it\u000d\u000a        became a world-wide benchmark for chemical mechanisms and we in Defra\u000d\u000a        were therefore able to feel great confidence in our international\u000d\u000a        negotiations having based our positions on such excellent science\"\u000d\u000a      (A). A detailed review for Defra provides a discussion of the MCM and of\u000d\u000a      its application in policy related work (A review of the Master Chemical\u000d\u000a        Mechanism, prepared for Defra, July 2007). Developments between\u000d\u000a      2007-2009 can be found in a 2009 project report to Defra (B) that\u000d\u000a      outlines the use of the MCM to model the formation of secondary organic\u000d\u000a      particulate matter (termed \"secondary organic aerosol\" in the report).\u000d\u000a    4.2 MCM as the gold standard to benchmark atmospheric pollution\u000d\u000a        models. Because of the need to accommodate detailed atmospheric\u000d\u000a      transport, models of air pollution for policy purposes simplify the\u000d\u000a      chemistry and reduce the number of species involved to make the\u000d\u000a      atmospheric modelling more manageable. Because of its fundamental nature,\u000d\u000a      and the quality of its response to experimental evaluation, the MCM has\u000d\u000a      contributed substantially to policy applications through its use as a reference\u000d\u000a        mechanism that can be used to test the smaller, less fundamentally\u000d\u000a      based mechanisms that are used in atmospheric policy models. In their\u000d\u000a      report to Defra on modelling tools for policy applications (Review of\u000d\u000a        tools for modelling tropospheric ozone formation and assessing impacts\u000d\u000a        on human health &amp; ecosystems, Report to Defra, November 2007),\u000d\u000a      Monks et al. stated: \"the traceability of chemical schemes\" (i.e.\u000d\u000a      mechanisms) \"to an explicit basis is a more robust methodology than the\u000d\u000a        use of tuned generic schemes\" (i.e. mechanisms not directly linked\u000d\u000a      to fundamental chemistry) \"and the MCM should be used as a reference\u000d\u000a        benchmark for this process.\" The Head of the Air Quality Programme\u000d\u000a      at Defra (2005-2010) has stated that the impact of MCM has been sustained\u000d\u000a      since 2008: \"The MCM has continued to provide a benchmark or standard\u000d\u000a      against which other, simpler, mechanisms are judged. Models using these\u000d\u000a        mechanisms are in continual use within Defra to inform and evaluate\u000d\u000a        policy, as demonstrated by the revision of the UNECE\/CLRTAP 'Gothenburg'\u000d\u000a        Protocol in 2012 and the forthcoming negotiations on a revision of the\u000d\u000a        EU National Emissions Ceilings Directive later this year\" (A). This\u000d\u000a      ongoing position was confirmed in 2013 by the current Head of the Air\u000d\u000a      Quality Science and Evidence Team at Defra (A).\u000d\u000a    A similar recommendation has also been made in the United States where\u000d\u000a      the Environmental Protection Agency now considers that the MCM \"is the\u000d\u000a        `gold standard' of chemical mechanisms.

The MCM is now\u000d\u000a      supported by the National Centre for Atmospheric Chemistry (Dr Andrew\u000d\u000a      Rickard), and may be accessed via a Leeds website (http:\/\/mcm.leeds.ac.uk\/MCM\/).\u000d\u000a      In addition to representation of the mechanism, together with rate\u000d\u000a      coefficients, the website provides output for incorporation into\u000d\u000a      atmospheric models.\u000d\u000a    2.2 MCM as a basis for policy modelling. Derwent, Jenkin and the\u000d\u000a      Leeds group also developed a predictive pollution model &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      photochemical trajectory model (PTM) &#8212; published in 1998 that combines\u000d\u000a      atmospheric transport and chemical reactions (2). The PTM models ozone\u000d\u000a      formation in an air parcel, driven by winds from central Europe to the UK,\u000d\u000a      and incorporates VOC and nitrogen oxide emissions from the surface. The\u000d\u000a      MCM is a key component of the model, allowing the different contributions\u000d\u000a      to ozone formation from specific VOCs to be quantified. A new VOC\u000d\u000a      characteristic &#8212; the photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) -\u000d\u000a      provides a relative measure of the impact of different VOCs on ozone\u000d\u000a      formation.\u000d\u000a    2.3 MCM evaluation and application. The complexity of the MCM\u000d\u000a      demands direct experimental testing of its mechanistic predictions.\u000d\u000a      Pilling has led developments in the use of atmospheric simulation chambers\u000d\u000a      to evaluate the MCM in a series of European consortia (EXACT, 1999-2002;\u000d\u000a      EUROCHAMP-1, 2004-2009; EUROCHAMP-2, 2009-2013, Integrated Infrastructures\u000d\u000a      Initiative; grants ii) (3). Experimental field measurements, coupled with\u000d\u000a      the MCM, have also been used to develop and test our understanding of\u000d\u000a      atmospheric chemistry. The construction in Leeds and application in the\u000d\u000a      field of an instrument to measure OH and HO2 radicals by\u000d\u000a      Heard,(4) and modelling of their concentrations with the MCM (e.g. (5)\u000d\u000a      published in 2006) have been central to these developments.\u000d\u000a    2.4 MCM: a validation tool for simplified models. The MCM is a\u000d\u000a      very large mechanism that is too large and complex for use in global or\u000d\u000a      even regional atmospheric models that include detailed atmospheric\u000d\u000a      transport. The MCM is however widely used to validate models of\u000d\u000a      atmospheric pollution that typically incorporate simpler, less\u000d\u000a      fundamentally based chemical mechanisms. For example, in a collaboration\u000d\u000a      between Leeds and US scientists in 2005-7, the MCM was used to evaluate\u000d\u000a      the chemical mechanism in a 3D global model, to interpret satellite\u000d\u000a      measurements of formaldehyde and to evaluate emissions of anthropogenic\u000d\u000a      and biogenic VOCs in S E Asia (6).\u000d\u000a    Key personnel\u000d\u000a      Professor Mike Pilling, Professor of Physical Chemistry, 1989-2007 and\u000d\u000a      Research Professor 2013.\u000d\u000a      Professor Dwayne Heard, University Research Fellow, 1994-2002 then Reader,\u000d\u000a      2002-4 then\u000d\u000a      Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry, 2004-.\u000d\u000a      Dr Sandra Saunders, postdoctoral researcher, 1991-2002.\u000d\u000a      Dr V Wagner, postdoctoral researcher, 1999 - 2001.\u000d\u000a      Dr Roberto Sommariva, graduate student, 2000-2004 and postdoctoral\u000d\u000a      researcher, 2011-2012.\u000d\u000a      Dr Claire Bloss, postdoctoral researcher, 2001-2003.\u000d\u000a      Dr Jenny Young (n&#233;e Stanton), graduate student, 2002-2006 and postdoctoral\u000d\u000a      researcher, 2007-.\u000d\u000a    Competitively-awarded funding following peer review\u000d\u000a    i.

The Warwick research was recognized by\u000d\u000a      Haddleton, Warwick Ventures Ltd and investors as having potential to\u000d\u000a      create new high-technology applications in the area of \"effect polymers\"\u000d\u000a      i.e. polymers as fine rather than bulk chemicals. Therefore the spin-out\u000d\u000a      company Warwick Effect Polymers Limited (WEP) was formed in 2001 with the\u000d\u000a      initial purpose of exploiting the new Warwick living radical\u000d\u000a      polymerization technology with end users. With a DTI SMART award, &#163;5k from\u000d\u000a      1st prize at a Cambridge Enterprise Launch Pad event and\u000d\u000a      investment from a US business angel [10] the company started trading in\u000d\u000a      2002. In 2013 WEP is still based in its own laboratories on the University\u000d\u000a      of Warwick Science Park employing 10-15 people on average [11]. The\u000d\u000a      company has also funded over 20 students and research fellows.\u000d\u000a    The relevant Warwick\/Haddleton IP was assigned to WEP, and a pipeline\u000d\u000a      agreement (2002-12) facilitated collaborative work with several companies\u000d\u000a      including Unilever, Courtaulds, ICI, BP, Geltex (Genzyme), Biocompatibles,\u000d\u000a      Syngenta, Elf AtoChem in exploiting the underpinning research. With\u000d\u000a      Unilever, for example, work on ABA triblocks led to patents relating to\u000d\u000a      personal care products which were subject to large scale customer trials\u000d\u000a      in the US and UK (2002-2006) [12] and this collaboration is ongoing (see\u000d\u000a      below). A director of a VC fund management company and private investor in\u000d\u000a      WEP (2003-2012) notes that the company \"had a strong track record of\u000d\u000a      undertaking paid research for large corporations\" [13]. During a\u000d\u000a      collaborative project the company caught the attention of a Vice President\u000d\u000a      of a multinational biotechnology company because of its \"potential for\u000d\u000a      impact in far-ranging areas\" and \"belief in the broad potential\" of WEP\u000d\u000a      technology [10] and this individual became a director and private investor\u000d\u000a      in WEP. In 2005 the company won the Lord Stafford award for best\u000d\u000a      University spin out in the West Midlands and Haddleton was awarded the RSC\u000d\u000a      Chemistry World Entrepreneur of the year. In 2013 the founder of another\u000d\u000a      VC Fund Management company described WEP as \"an exemplar of the high\u000d\u000a      quality research innovations with disruptive global potential.\" [11]\u000d\u000a    During the REF2014 period, the focus of the company was the development\u000d\u000a      of the Warwick technology in polymers for therapeutics and nanomedicine\u000d\u000a      [13]; markets that could stand the increased costs of production of\u000d\u000a      precision polymers from living radical polymerization. The pegylation and\u000d\u000a      glycopolymer work described in section 2 became a strategic activity with\u000d\u000a      the aim of improving aspects of protein, peptide and subsequently siRNA\u000d\u000a      (small interfering RNA) therapeutics- classes of biological drug. Building\u000d\u000a      on the collaboratively generated intellectual property, specific protein\u000d\u000a      and peptide therapeutics identified by biotech partners were optimised\u000d\u000a      with the new conjugation and polymerisation technology. WEP's comb\u000d\u000a      polymers (PolyPEGTM) have the advantage of \"lower viscosity\u000d\u000a      compared to conventional PEG polymer [that] is utilised to extend the in\u000a        vivo half-life of protein therapeutics by reducing the clearance\u000d\u000a      rate.\" This advantage \"has been demonstrated [in projects throughout the\u000d\u000a      REF2014 period] by WEP's partners within the pharmaceutical industry\" [14]\u000d\u000a      and was one of the key drivers for WEP's eventual acquisition (see below).\u000d\u000a    To support its R&amp;D programme, WEP received &#163;3.77M since 2001 in\u000d\u000a      venture capital funding (angel investors plus national, international and\u000d\u000a      regional venture capital trusts) [15,16] and the company now holds three\u000d\u000a      patent families for targeting polymers; \"a very important segment of\u000d\u000a      intellectual property\" [10]. As a measure of activity, total expenditure\u000d\u000a      over the REF2014 period was &#163;3.0M spread evenly over that period [15].\u000d\u000a      Since 2008, WEP has supplemented its capital investment through a\u000d\u000a      portfolio of more than 10 multi-contract projects with major companies.\u000d\u000a      For example, with Unilever, a new technology in protein conjugation of\u000d\u000a      polymers has been developed to protect human hair against damaging\u000d\u000a      treatments [17]. New synthetic glycopolymer technologies, transferred to\u000d\u000a      WEP under the pipeline agreement and developed as GlycoPolTM\u000d\u000a      and ZenoPolTM (trademarked 2009 and 2011 respectively) are\u000d\u000a      being tested by a global pharmaceuticals leader for gene delivery [14,\u000d\u000a      18].\u000d\u000a    In 2012 WEP was acquired by PolyTherics Ltd in a substantial\u000d\u000a      (undisclosed) share-for-share deal and is now a wholly owned subsidiary\u000d\u000a      still based at the Warwick Science Park. Polytherics explains that their\u000d\u000a      interest was driven by WEPs patent portfolio and the existence of \"a\u000d\u000a      number of programmes with one of the top 5 pharmaceutical companies\"\u000d\u000a      [14,19]. The deal \"brought together complementary technologies...to extend\u000d\u000a      the pharmacokinetics of biological therapeutics through polymer\u000d\u000a      conjugation\" [14]. An industry expert notes, \"the continuing evolution of\u000d\u000a      PolyPEG by large pharma companies, and the increased interest in\u000d\u000a      GlycoPol...by some of the same players, continues to validate the\u000d\u000a      strategy\" [10]. Products utilising PolyTherics and WEP technologies are\u000d\u000a      \"expected to enter clinical development in 2014 and the company will\u000d\u000a      receive milestone payments and royalties from the successful development\u000d\u000a      and commercialisation of these products\" [14]. The acquisition has thereby\u000d\u000a      allowed WEP to attain the security required for its long term partner\u000d\u000a      projects in drug delivery and development. The specialist polymer team and\u000d\u000a      laboratory continues with some PolyTherics activities relocating from\u000d\u000a      London to WEP's premises. For the Polytherics group, WEP provides the\u000d\u000a      effect polymers technology and expertise that it was established to\u000d\u000a      create.\u000d\u000a    In July 2013, following PolyTherics acquisition of WEP and Antitope Ltd,\u000d\u000a      &#163;13.5M further investment was raised from some of WEP's funders (Mercia\u000d\u000a      Fund Management and Advantage Enterprise &amp; Innovation Fund) and\u000d\u000a      Invesco Perpetual. The group now employs more than 80 staff.

A key design feature of these catalysts\u000d\u000a      is that they stabilise Cu(I) relative to Cu(II) allowing control over the\u000d\u000a      equilibrium position of the key reaction step - radical chain-end\u000d\u000a      formation. The concentration of radicals is thus controlled, preventing\u000d\u000a      termination by radical-radical reaction events, and the result is a\u000d\u000a      so-called living polymerization. In particular the method was unusually\u000d\u000a      successful with methacrylate (as opposed to acrylate) monomers. Funded by\u000d\u000a      the EPSRC [7-9] and others, over 100 papers have been published by\u000d\u000a      Haddleton and group in this area.\u000d\u000a    This Warwick living radical polymerization catalysis is generally\u000d\u000a      unaffected by the presence of functional groups either in the monomer or\u000d\u000a      the initiator from which the polymer grows. The use of new classes of\u000d\u000a      functionalized initiator was thereby feasible. A range of hydroxy\u000d\u000a      functionalized polymers from standard condensation and ring opening\u000d\u000a      polymerizations were shown to provide useful macro-initiators providing a\u000d\u000a      facile route to AB and ABA block copolymers. These gave new combinations\u000d\u000a      of functional properties in the polymers, such as adhesion, pH\u000d\u000a      sensitivity, thermal response and hydrophobicity\/hydrophilicity [2].\u000d\u000a    Pegylation - the covalent attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) groups to\u000d\u000a      active pharmaceutical ingredients - was a topical strategy in the early\u000d\u000a      2000s for improvement of drug delivery and pharmacokinetics. Warwick's\u000d\u000a      catalyst technology could provide many new hydrophilic and functional\u000d\u000a      polymer conjugates with highly tuneable properties via living radical\u000d\u000a      polymerization processes. It was further realized that one of the\u000d\u000a      deficiencies of conventional single-site pegylation is that, as the\u000d\u000a      molecular weight of the PEG is increased, clearance from the body becomes\u000d\u000a      a problem. Ranges of new polymers with comb-like architectures and\u000d\u000a      cleavable ester groups were thus developed for this application [3,4,5].\u000d\u000a      Among the advantages of these new systems are that viscosity is\u000d\u000a      essentially independent of molecular weight (allowing clearance from the\u000d\u000a      body), and that there is a low tendency to crystallise, thus reducing\u000d\u000a      damage to liver, spleen and brain [3,4].\u000d\u000a    The work was expanded by Haddleton and group to the preparation of\u000d\u000a      synthetic glycopolymers from functional initiators for bioconjugation. The\u000d\u000a      approach used was to add simple sugars to a preformed polymer backbone\u000d\u000a      facilitating the synthesis of the glycopolymers and exploiting the\u000d\u000a      glyco-cluster effect; enhanced binding and lectin (carbohydrate-binding\u000d\u000a      protein) recognition as a result of proximity of a number of sugar units.\u000d\u000a      The majority of this research was conducted with salmon calcitonin - a\u000d\u000a      clinical drug for osteoporosis. This work proved to be a landmark with\u000d\u000a      many research groups and companies now looking at synthetic glycopolymers\u000d\u000a      for a range of glycocode applications; Haddleton's first publication on\u000d\u000a      the subject in 2006 has received &gt;340 citations to date [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7262","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    During the EPSRC's 2009 Chemistry International Review, a senior officer\u000d\u000a      of the Index Ventures- backed company Funxional Therapeutics Ltd with a\u000d\u000a      substantial track record in the `biotech' industry described the company's\u000d\u000a      interaction with Fox at Warwick as \"the life-blood of FXT\" [5]. In the\u000d\u000a      period 2006-13 the Fox group at Warwick has been the de facto\u000d\u000a      chemistry group for FXT and was involved in all aspects of medicinal\u000d\u000a      chemistry and biological investigation; exploratory synthesis,\u000d\u000a      lead-optimisation, compound selection and preclinical chemical development\u000d\u000a      [6]. The identification of FX125L as the lead candidate, underpinned by\u000d\u000a      the continuing confidence borne of the medicinal and biological mechanism\u000d\u000a      research at Warwick [1-4] led to FXT's decision to push FX125L into\u000d\u000a      clinical trials [5,7] and, \"made the key chemistry contribution to the\u000d\u000a      success of this programme\" [6].\u000d\u000a    In 2008 Fox acted on behalf of FXT as lead chemistry consultant for the\u000d\u000a      synthesis of multiple kilograms of FX125L. The synthetic route developed\u000d\u000a      at Warwick (see Section 2) was transferred to a contract research\u000d\u000a      organisation employed by FXT. Fox subsequently provided the scientific\u000d\u000a      direction and substantial new experimental input, and, \"convincingly\u000d\u000a      solved several problems that emerged during scale-up\" [6] including\u000d\u000a      unwanted racemisation and the suspected crystallisation of FX125L as\u000d\u000a      different polymorphs. As part of the consultancy, analytical standards\u000d\u000a      were also developed at Warwick to test the long-term chemical and\u000d\u000a      stereochemical stability of FX125L [5]. A second Funxional Therapeutics\u000d\u000a      senior officer states that, \"the underpinning work commissioned by FXT at\u000d\u000a      Warwick was used in the initiation of clinical trials,\" and following the\u000d\u000a      FDA approved Investigational New Drug (IND) application of FX125L for the\u000d\u000a      treatment of asthma (January 2009) and access to large quantities of pure\u000d\u000a      FX125L from the Warwick route, Phase 1 trials were started [8]. Studies in\u000d\u000a      an animal model of allergic asthma quickly showed that FX125L exhibits a\u000d\u000a      superior efficacy profile to dexamethasone or montelucast [9].\u000d\u000a    As part of Phase 1 trials, 66 healthy participants in the USA received a\u000d\u000a      wide range of doses (0.03 mg to 3 g of FX125L), and the study was\u000d\u000a      completed in July 2009. FX125L was safe and well tolerated at all dose\u000d\u000a      levels. No serious adverse events or patient withdrawal were observed\u000d\u000a      [10]. The pharmacokinetic profile of FX125L was linear over the wide range\u000d\u000a      of doses studied, which led to the development of a convenient once-daily\u000d\u000a      oral dosing regimen. \"The results in humans are consistent with the\u000d\u000a      preclinical data, suggesting that FX125L has a very wide safety margin,\u000d\u000a      and confirmed the excellent drug-like profile of FX125L\" [8].\u000d\u000a    In January 2010 a second Phase 1 study in which US patients received\u000d\u000a      multiple ascending doses was completed and the results were \"entirely\u000d\u000a      consistent with those of the single dose study and confirmed the excellent\u000d\u000a      drug-like profile of FX125L\" [11].\u000d\u000a    Phase 2 clinical trials studying the effects of FX125L on asthma, COPD,\u000d\u000a      rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis were announced [11] and in May 2010,\u000d\u000a      FXT reported that it had raised &#8364;10M in a private Series B financing round\u000d\u000a      to fund these initial Phase 2 clinical studies in inflammatory disease\u000d\u000a      [12].\u000d\u000a    FXT have stated that as a result of the underpinning Warwick research\u000d\u000a      \"FX125L has optimal CMC (chemistry, manufacturing and controls)\u000d\u000a      characteristics and is obtained by a straightforward 3-step chemical\u000d\u000a      synthesis with an extremely low cost of goods\" [5,7]. In addition FX125L\u000d\u000a      was described as an \"ideal pharmaceutical\" by potential large\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical firm investors [5]. The collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Warwick was therefore vital for the success of Phase 1 clinical trials and\u000d\u000a      the continuing funding and progress of Phase 2 trials [5,6].\u000d\u000a    In July 2012 Boehringer Ingelheim and Funxional Therapeutics announced\u000d\u000a      acquisition by the former of FX125L and the somatotaxin portfolio to treat\u000d\u000a      inflammation. This sale generated an undisclosed multi-million pound\u000d\u000a      return for FXT and its investors [13]. \"The confidence that Funxional was\u000d\u000a      thereby able to create in the synthetic route and analytical standards,\u000d\u000a      alongside the novel and highly favourable performance of the drug,\u000d\u000a      underpinned BI's decision to acquire FX125L and the somatotaxin portfolio\"\u000d\u000a      [6].\u000d\u000a    The Warwick research thus provided the synthetic and medicinal chemistry\u000d\u000a      that allowed phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials in humans and underpinned\u000d\u000a      investor confidence. This led to substantial economic impact in the\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical industry and will lead to important health impacts in a\u000d\u000a      disease area that affects the majority of families. The success of FX125L\u000d\u000a      and the identification of the SSTR2 as its molecular target has led to\u000d\u000a      Index Ventures employment of Fox as their lead medicinal chemist in their\u000d\u000a      new biotech companies E3Bio Ltd and Purple Pharmaceuticals Ltd [5].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    A new anti-inflammatory molecule FX125L was developed by David Fox at\u000d\u000a      Warwick, in collaboration with David Grainger (Department of Medicine,\u000d\u000a      Cambridge) and Funxional Therapeutics Ltd (FXT).

The short-listed molecules\u000d\u000a      were tested in collaboration with Funxional Therapeutics in a range of\u000d\u000a      preclinical experiments to determine their ADMET (absorption,\u000d\u000a      distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) properties and in\u000d\u000a        vitro and in vivo efficacy. Fox and Grainger analysed these\u000d\u000a      results and two potential candidates were selected; FX97L and FX125L.\u000d\u000a      While both compounds contained the same 2,2-dimethylpropionylamino\u000d\u000a      sidechain, Fox developed at Warwick a new and highly efficient one-pot,\u000d\u000a      three step synthesis of the piperidinone FX125L as a single enantiomer.\u000d\u000a      This was a far easier process than that required for the synthesis of the\u000d\u000a      enantiomerically pure seven-membered ring of FX97L and was subsequently\u000d\u000a      taken forward. The results of all this research were published as a highly\u000d\u000a      detailed patent incorporating extensive data [1]. While the structure of\u000d\u000a      the chemical compound that is FX125L has thus been published, it has not\u000d\u000a      been explicitly labelled as such for reasons of commercial sensitivity and\u000d\u000a      in accord to the wishes of Funxional Therapeutics Ltd.\u000d\u000a    The identification of FX125L as a potential anti-inflammatory clinical\u000d\u000a      candidate prompted Fox and group to design and synthesise new classes of\u000d\u000a      both arylcarbonylamino- and arylsulfonylamino- lactams as back-up drug\u000d\u000a      candidates. Various arene substitution patterns were investigated\u000d\u000a      including fluoro and trifluoromethyl substitutions, and various of the\u000d\u000a      compounds were found to have potencies in an in vitro cell\u000d\u000a      migration assay equivalent or better than FX125L (in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Grainger). Two patent applications concerning the use of these compounds\u000d\u000a      as anti-inflammatory agents have been published [2,3].\u000d\u000a    The proposal from Grainger that the biological target of BSCIs is the\u000d\u000a      somatostatin G protein coupled receptor SSTR2, prompted Fox and group to\u000d\u000a      design and synthesise hybrid lactam containing compounds and traditional\u000d\u000a      non-lactam SSTR2 agonists and antagonists [4]. This resulted in\u000d\u000a      development of a `split binding' or allosteric model for the active site\u000d\u000a      of SSTR2 (i.e. that both somatostatin and FX125L can induce receptor\u000d\u000a      signalling). It was also determined that some non-lactam derivatives can\u000d\u000a      act as cell migration inhibitors [4]. This research suggests that the\u000d\u000a      biochemistry of somatostain is far more complex than previously thought.\u000d\u000a      The activity of these peptide analogues (i.e. that both series act as\u000d\u000a      BSCIs) strongly supported the first-in-class status of FX125L, boosting\u000d\u000a      investor confidence (Section 4).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7263","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Catalytic hydrogenation is a pivotal chemical transformation which\u000a      underpins the synthesis of numerous high-value target molecules, materials\u000a      and intermediates.

A\u000a      rapidly growing number of impacts are reported here with commercial\u000a      catalyst producers, suppliers and pharmaceutical companies in several\u000a      countries.\u000a    Commercialisation of the `tethered' catalysts by Johnson Matthey\u000a    The Wills catalyst was tested by Johnson Matthey Catalysis and Chiral\u000a      Technologies (JM CCT) and the system \"emerged [...] as the only transfer\u000a      hydrogenation catalysts providing activity on the difficult substrate\u000a      under study\" and offering \"remarkably increased activity when compared to\u000a      previous generations of catalysts while retaining high enantioselectivity\"\u000a      [10]. A team of nine inventors worked at JM CCT on a scalable synthetic\u000a      route to the catalysts, which was later demonstrated on multi-100s gram\u000a      scale and kg-scale at Alfa Aesar; a Johnson Matthey company [10]. A patent\u000a      was filed in 2009 [11].\u000a    Since 2009 JM CCT &#8212; through Alfa Aesar, SigmaAldrich and Strem &#8212; has sold\u000a      four Wills tethered catalysts in the family, either individually or as a\u000a      part of a `kit' (catalogue prices &#163;368-&#163;560 per gram). JM CCT also uses\u000a      the material in collaborative projects with client companies worldwide\u000a      [10].\u000a    While specific details of JM CCT customers and sales are confidential,\u000a      they state that Wills catalysts have been made (2009 &#8212; June 2013) \"on\u000a      multi Kg scale for several international customers involved in the\u000a      production of pharmaceutical intermediates\" [10]. JM CCT also states that\u000a      \"1 kg of catalyst may be sufficient for making tonnes of a particular\u000a      target\" [10]. The catalysts are used in large scale processes.\u000a    Use of Wills catalysts by pharmaceutical companies in research, scale-up and production\u000a    A large number of pharmaceutical and related companies have used the\u000a      catalysts in the synthesis of target molecules, as evidenced below, with\u000a      several quoting the use of the JM CCT supplier, and all describing\u000a      specific Wills catalysts or directly citing Wills papers. The Wills\u000a      catalyst system is readily available and easy to apply.\u000a      Enantioselectivity, functional group tolerance and catalyst stability are\u000a      all more favourable than in the untethered Noyori system. Hence, there has\u000a      been rapid take-up of the catalysts by industry. The examples below almost\u000a      certainly represent a small proportion of the number of actual uses,\u000a      patents, and the economic and healthcare impacts of the Warwick research.\u000a    \u000a      AstraZeneca (Sweden &amp; UK), one of the largest pharmaceutical\u000a        companies in the world, describes in a process patent the use of (S,S)-teth-TsDpen-RuCl\u000a        (a JM CCT trade name for a Wills catalyst) in the catalytic asymmetric\u000a        synthesis of a class of anti-asthmatic bronchodilator drugs [12].\u000a      Synthon BV (Netherlands) report the use of a Wills catalyst in the key\u000a        chirality-inducing reduction step in their synthesis of the\u000a        anti-asthmatic drug montelukast (singulair), a drug which in 2010 was\u000a        the fourth most prescribed drug in the US (24.7 M). They conclude, \"It\u000a        has now been discovered that the use of [Wills catalyst] can provide a\u000a        more suitable process for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation\u000a        reaction\" [13].\u000a      Archimica GMBH (Germany) patented the use of a Wills tethered catalyst\u000a        in the key chirality-generating step of their synthesis of the third\u000a        generation antiepileptic drug Eslicarbazepine [14].\u000a      Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany), one of the largest pharmaceutical\u000a        companies in the world, describe their route to certain chemokine\u000a        inhibitors via the reduction of an early-stage intermediate using a\u000a        Wills tethered catalyst [15].\u000a      Lek Pharmaceuticals (Slovenia), part of the Sandoz group, has reported\u000a        an improved process for the preparation of intermediates on route to\u000a        non-steroidal selective estrogen receptor modulators such as\u000a        lasofoxifene using the Wills catalyst [16].\u000a      In collaboration with Eli Lilly (USA), one of the largest\u000a        pharmaceutical companies in the world, JM CCT have developed an achiral\u000a        version of the Wills tethered catalysts and have applied this to racemic\u000a        reductions [10].\u000a    \u000a    Additional examples from a rapidly growing list further demonstrate the\u000a      international commercial reach of the Wills catalysts, in e.g. China\u000a      (Hunan Fangsheng Pharma, patent CN102978253A), USA (Ambit Biosciences,\u000a      patent US2012053193A1) and Italy (Zach Systems\/Zambon Chemicals, patent\u000a      WO2012120086).\u000a    Commercialisation of Wills tether catalysts by others\u000a    With Dr Reddys Ltd (DRL), the Wills group investigated the development of\u000a      a further class of tethered catalyst containing an ether linkage (2007-11)\u000a      [17]. At this time another industrial lab (Takasago, Japan) disclosed work\u000a      on this specific variant [18] and this tethered catalyst has subsequently\u000a      been commercialised by Takasago under the trade name DENEB [19]. A\u000a      representative of DRL notes in respect of this commercialisation,\u000a      \"Takasago have clearly invested a great deal of funding in DENEB\" [17].\u000a    Further companies have developed catalysts that use the Wills tether\u000a      concept: a nitrogen atom tether system was reported by PhosPhoenix SARL\u000a      researchers (Org. Lett. 2013, 15, 1614-1617); a\u000a      polymer-supported version of a Wills tethered catalysts was commercialised\u000a      by PolyAn [20].\u000a    Continuing research at Warwick and commercial collaboration with JM\u000a          CCT\u000a    JM CCT recognized the commercial need for the use of dihydrogen as the\u000a      primary reducing agent and will develop this area with Wills through a\u000a      TSB-funded collaborative grant Development of the future generation of\u000a        catalysts for asymmetric reduction (TSB ref: 101330, Mar 2013, &#163;216k\u000a      plus &#163;108K from JM CCT), extending the range of catalysts and their\u000a      applications.

Noyori (Nagoya, Japan) reported a series of\u000a      ruthenium-based catalysts containing an arene and chiral diamine that\u000a      demonstrated high reactivity and selectivity for the asymmetric reduction\u000a      of ketones to alcohols &#8212; versatile intermediates in pharmaceutical\u000a      manufacture. At Warwick, Professor Martin Wills and his research team have\u000a      been carrying out research in the area of asymmetric reduction using\u000a      organometallic catalysts, with a focus on their applications, as described\u000a      in over 40 publications since 1997. A major project carried out as part of\u000a      this research was directed at the development of improved variants of the\u000a      `Noyori catalysts'. The resulting `Wills catalysts' [1-6] have\u000a      substantially higher activity, use lower catalyst loadings and cause fewer\u000a      side reactions. This reduces cost, waste and energy usage.\u000a    In 2004, Wills was awarded the first of three EPSRC grants to support his\u000a      research in this area [7-9]. This led to the development of a series of\u000a      novel Ru(II)-based catalysts, in which a covalent tether from the chiral\u000a      diamine component to the 03b76-arene unit was incorporated.\u000a      This tether &#8212; the essential motif of the Wills catalyst family &#8212; provides\u000a      conformational and chemical stability as well as the unprecedented\u000a      potential to create derivatives with a predictable structure. Wills\u000a      established the principle of tethering in this system in 2004 [1], and\u000a      systems with exceptional activity and versatility were reported in 2005\u000a      [2]. The tethering concept was further extended to analogous Rh catalysts\u000a      [3].\u000a    Wills and his group further developed the new Ru(II) tethered catalysts,\u000a      and reported their mechanisms and wider applications in the following\u000a      years (11 additional papers). In particular, the research resulted in the\u000a      development of a catalyst for the reduction of a wide range of ketone\u000a      substrates to alcohols under transfer-hydrogenation conditions (formic\u000a      acid being the most commonly used source of hydrogen) [4,5], and later\u000a      to the extension of the catalyst to pressure-hydrogenation\u000a      reactions (where hydrogen gas is used as the reducing agent) [6]. It was\u000a      this class of highly engineered catalysts that led to the enhanced\u000a      reaction rates and increased compatibility needed for the key substrate\u000a      classes used in industry. These include &#945;-chloroacetophenones and\u000a      2-ketopyridines (which are prone to side reactions leading to catalyst\u000a      deactivation), and highly hindered substrates (which are normally\u000a      unreactive).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11775","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research at Durham aimed at developing an open-flow cryostat capable of\u000d\u000a      cooling below liquid\u000d\u000a      nitrogen temperatures [1] was performed as part of an EPSRC-funded project\u000d\u000a      in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Oxford Cryosystems (OC).

In order to\u000d\u000a      understand, develop and exploit structure-property relationships in these\u000d\u000a      materials, high resolution\u000d\u000a      X-ray-derived structural information is required across a wide temperature\u000d\u000a      range. Low\u000d\u000a      temperatures also provide higher quality structural information than\u000d\u000a      ambient studies and allow\u000d\u000a      study of otherwise unstable systems. JAKH therefore designed, constructed\u000d\u000a      and developed the\u000d\u000a      unique Fddd diffractometer [1] integrating closed cycle cryo-refrigeration\u000d\u000a      and a high intensity X-ray\u000d\u000a      beam to enable crystallographic studies of very small crystals down to 9\u000d\u000a      K. Single crystal X-ray\u000d\u000a      diffraction studies in the UK had been restricted previously to\u000d\u000a      temperatures above 100K using\u000d\u000a      liquid nitrogen temperatures as coolant. The unique facilities developed\u000d\u000a      in Durham enabled low\u000d\u000a      temperature studies on a number of important systems with exploitable\u000d\u000a      macroscopic properties,\u000d\u000a      but, using a point detector, experiments were slow and only a limited\u000d\u000a      number of temperatures\u000d\u000a      could be studied.\u000d\u000a    The advent of CCD detectors for laboratory diffractometers provided a\u000d\u000a      solution to the speed\u000d\u000a      problem, but the data quality obtainable at sub 100 K temperatures was\u000d\u000a      severely limited by the\u000d\u000a      complex cryostat environment, with heat shields and windows severely\u000d\u000a      attenuating the beam and\u000d\u000a      giving rise to their own strong X-ray scatter. JAKH therefore initiated\u000d\u000a      research into the development\u000d\u000a      of an open-flow cooling device, similar to the now ubiquitous liquid\u000d\u000a      nitrogen devices, but capable of\u000d\u000a      reaching much lower temperatures [F1]. The cryostat developed, the HeliX,\u000d\u000a      allowed the first rapid\u000d\u000a      full structural investigations of novel systems maintained at sub 100 K\u000d\u000a      temperatures in an open\u000d\u000a      environment, allowing rapid data acquisition. The design also enabled\u000d\u000a      laser excitation of samples\u000d\u000a      allowing full structural investigations of thermally trapped, optically\u000d\u000a      induced, excited spin state\u000d\u000a      complexes [2,3].\u000d\u000a    Many of the new materials prepared and studied in Durham are in\u000d\u000a      polycrystalline (powdered) form,\u000d\u000a      but there is still a need to study their low temperature structural\u000d\u000a      properties. Examples of materials\u000d\u000a      include those showing negative thermal expansion behaviour [F2],\u000d\u000a      electronic phase transitions or\u000d\u000a      light-induced changes. The need to study these materials [3,4] led to [F3]\u000d\u000a      research by JSOE\/AEG\u000d\u000a      to develop and exploit the pHeniX cryostat for powder diffraction. The\u000d\u000a      design incorporated novel\u000d\u000a      features to allow operation on a range of lab-based instruments with a\u000d\u000a      variety of different sample\u000d\u000a      types.\u000d\u000a    The experimental structural and materials science undertaken at Durham\u000d\u000a      has required parallel\u000d\u000a      development of computational methods and software tools. In the area of\u000d\u000a      single crystal diffraction\u000d\u000a      the JAKH group has an extensive research programme in the development of\u000d\u000a      computational tools\u000d\u000a      for data analysis. With EPSRC funding they designed and delivered an\u000d\u000a      innovative, future-proof,\u000d\u000a      toolbox based software suite (Olex2) based on Python-integration of a\u000d\u000a      series of small modules [F4]\u000d\u000a      using fit-for-purpose programming codes, informed by X-ray crystallography\u000d\u000a      expertise. This\u000d\u000a      approach allows the efficient use of established routines and the parallel\u000d\u000a      development of new\u000d\u000a      algorithms [5]. In the area of powder diffraction, JSOE has been involved\u000d\u000a      in the development of the\u000d\u000a      Topas suite of software and its application for novel data analysis since\u000d\u000a      the late 1990s. He has\u000d\u000a      developed data analysis methods for parametric fitting of huge bodies of\u000d\u000a      diffraction data, for\u000d\u000a      analysing neutron and energy dispersive diffraction data, and\u000d\u000a      distortion-mode modelling of\u000d\u000a      functional materials; these are used by industry and academics [6,7].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11776","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In 1992 BNFL established a spin-out company, BNFL Fluorochemicals Ltd,\u000d\u000a      later F2 Chemicals Ltd,\u000d\u000a      to develop new markets in the fine chemicals sector using their expertise\u000d\u000a      in the production and\u000d\u000a      handling of F2 developed from nuclear power generation\u000d\u000a      applications. A research team (3 PDRA\u000d\u000a      employees, 3 years) from the company was seconded to the Chemistry\u000d\u000a      Department at Durham\u000d\u000a      (1992-1995) in order to establish a skill base, expertise and IPR in the\u000d\u000a      field. The company also\u000d\u000a      provided funds for building and equipping a new, purpose-built research\u000d\u000a      laboratory for handling F2\u000d\u000a      within the Chemistry Department and RDC subsequently became a\u000d\u000a      non-executive Director of the\u000d\u000a      company. The following period (1993-1996) resulted in a suite of over 20\u000d\u000a      patent applications which\u000d\u000a      were filed, granted and maintained by F2 Chemicals arising from the Durham\u000d\u000a      research\u000d\u000a      collaboration. Most importantly, development of new selective fluorination\u000d\u000a      methodology of &#946;-ketoesters\u000d\u000a      in high dielectric constant media was investigated and exemplified at\u000d\u000a      Durham on a 1 g\u000d\u000a      scale and published by the DU research team in collaboration with F2\u000d\u000a      Chemicals in 1996 [2]\u000d\u000a      following IPR protection [Im1]. Subsequently, Durham direct fluorination\u000d\u000a      reaction methodology\u000d\u000a      using F2 [2] was adopted and scaled up to a manufacturing\u000d\u000a      process by F2 Chemicals Ltd [Im2] with\u000d\u000a      the design, investment and construction of a 1000 litre Selective Direct\u000d\u000a      Fluorination (SDF) plant\u000d\u000a      (Fig. 1a) at their headquarters in Preston to synthesise products for\u000d\u000a      customers in the life science\u000d\u000a      industries.\u000d\u000a    V-FEND (Voriconazole, Pfizer, Fig. 1b) is the world-wide best-selling\u000d\u000a      systemic, antifungal agent\u000d\u000a      and has a 5-fluoropyrimidine sub-unit 1 as part of its structure.\u000d\u000a      Manufacture of fluoropyrimidine\u000d\u000a      intermediate 1 had been carried out previously by multi-step,\u000d\u000a      resource intensive strategies\u000d\u000a      described by Pfizer scientists [Im3] but new Durham methods for selective\u000d\u000a      direct fluorination of &#946;-ketoesters\u000d\u000a      using F2 [2] provided the opportunity for a more efficient\u000d\u000a      2-step process, that is far less\u000d\u000a      expensive and generates less waste than other procedures. Given this new\u000d\u000a      business opportunity,\u000d\u000a      Durham direct fluorination methodology [2] for the synthesis of\u000d\u000a      &#946;-fluoroketoester 2 (Fig. 1b), as the\u000d\u000a      key starting material for the manufacture of 5-fluoropyrimiide system 1,\u000d\u000a      was developed and scaled-up\u000d\u000a      by F2 Chemicals and used through all the clinical trial, launch and\u000d\u000a      commercialization periods of\u000d\u000a      V-FEND by Pfizer [Im3].

Aspergillosis is primarily an\u000d\u000a      infection of the lungs caused\u000d\u000a      by the inhalation of airborne spores of the fungus Aspergillus\u000d\u000a      which is commonly found growing on\u000d\u000a      dead leaves, stored grain, compost piles, or in other decaying vegetation.\u000d\u000a      There are several forms\u000d\u000a      of aspergillosis: pulmonary aspergillosis is an allergic reaction to the\u000d\u000a      fungus that usually develops\u000d\u000a      in people who already have lung problems (such as asthma or cystic\u000d\u000a      fibrosis); aspergilloma is a\u000d\u000a      growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of past lung disease or lung\u000d\u000a      scarring (such as\u000d\u000a      tuberculosis or lung abscess) and pulmonary aspergillosis (invasive type)\u000d\u000a      is a serious infection\u000d\u000a      associated with pneumonia that can spread to other parts of the body. This\u000d\u000a      infection almost always\u000d\u000a      occurs in people with a weakened immune system due to cancer, AIDS,\u000d\u000a      leukaemia, an organ\u000d\u000a      transplant, chemotherapy, or other conditions or medications that lower\u000d\u000a      the number of normal\u000d\u000a      white blood cells or weaken the immune system. For example, invasive\u000d\u000a      pulmonary aspergillosis\u000d\u000a      (IPA) is estimated to occur in 5-13% of people who have a bone marrow\u000d\u000a      transplant, 5-25% of\u000d\u000a      people with a heart or lung transplant and 10-20% of people who undergo\u000d\u000a      high-dose radiotherapy\u000d\u000a      for leukaemia.\u000d\u000a    Durham selective fluorination chemistry [2, Im1] has therefore played a\u000d\u000a      significant role in impacting\u000d\u000a      many patients treated by V-FEND, giving world-wide health benefits in the\u000d\u000a      treatment of fungal\u000d\u000a      infections for a wide range of disease control.\u000d\u000a    In order to further develop the use of Durham F2 chemistry for\u000d\u000a      fine chemical manufacture, a\u000d\u000a      Durham University spin-out company, Brock Fine Chemicals Ltd [Im7], was\u000d\u000a      established in April\u000d\u000a      2011 by Graham Sandford with assistance and legal expertise from Durham\u000d\u000a      Business Innovation\u000d\u000a      Services (DBIS).

Considerable\u000d\u000a      research funding from\u000d\u000a      the company to Durham allowed the development of a wide ranging blue-skies\u000d\u000a      research\u000d\u000a      programme into the use of F2 for organic synthesis and this\u000d\u000a      continues at Durham to the present.\u000d\u000a      Expertise was developed to overcome the many problems of using F2\u000d\u000a      for the safe synthesis of fine\u000d\u000a      chemicals. In particular, techniques involving the use of dilute F2\u000d\u000a      in nitrogen, appropriate solvent\u000d\u000a      choice (high dielectric constant media such as formic acid, sulfuric acid\u000d\u000a      or acetonitrile) [1], reactor\u000d\u000a      vessel design, gas flow regulator systems and stainless steel\/monel\u000d\u000a      fluorine gas handling lines\u000d\u000a      have been developed over the years in Durham. This has allowed selective\u000d\u000a      direct fluorination of a\u000d\u000a      range of aliphatic, dicarbonyl [2], aromatic, heteroaromatic,\u000d\u000a      heterocyclic, steroid and carbohydrate\u000d\u000a      derivatives to be established and the mechanism (regiochemistry,\u000d\u000a      stereochemistry, selectivity) of\u000d\u000a      these processes to be explored. Indeed, we have shown that controlled\u000d\u000a      direct fluorination of\u000d\u000a      aromatic rings is now feasible at room temperature [1].\u000d\u000a    The control of F2 reactivity by promoting selective\u000d\u000a      electrophilic reactions using high dielectric\u000d\u000a      constant media [1] was particularly important, and F2 can now\u000d\u000a      be considered to act as a typical\u000d\u000a      electrophilic reagent for a range of electrophilic aliphatic and aromatic\u000d\u000a      substitution processes. In\u000d\u000a      particular, efficient direct selective fluorination processes of\u000d\u000a      &#946;-dicarbonyl and &#946;-ketoester\u000d\u000a      substrates were established for the first time using acetonitrile or\u000d\u000a      formic acid as reaction media [2]\u000d\u000a      to give various fluoro-dicarbonyl and fluoro-ketoester systems in high\u000d\u000a      yield.\u000d\u000a    Further control of selective fluorination reactions was achieved by the\u000d\u000a      design, fabrication and\u000d\u000a      commissioning of single and multi-channel continuous flow reactor systems,\u000d\u000a      establishing the use of\u000d\u000a      convenient and inexpensive flow reactors for gas\/liquid processes in the\u000d\u000a      laboratory [3]. Key new\u000d\u000a      techniques for the supply of individual gas (F2) and liquid\u000d\u000a      reagents from single sources to a parallel\u000d\u000a      array of many flow channels at the same flow rate and pressure whilst\u000d\u000a      maintaining laminar flow\u000d\u000a      within the reactor channels were incorporated into the reactor designs.\u000d\u000a    Fluorine gas can also be used an enabler of other chemical\u000d\u000a      transformations.

These included: Sensors for\u000d\u000a      Medicine and Science (1999-2001, Gaithersburg USA; Parker became a\u000d\u000a      foundation shareholder); Molecular Devices (2004-7, Sunnyvale,\u000d\u000a      California); and CISbio Bioassays (2005-2014, Codolet, France). In 2007\/8,\u000d\u000a      Molecular Devices marketed an assay [Im1] for high throughput screening of\u000d\u000a      kinase inhibitors using a nanoparticle labelled with a Tb complex\u000d\u000a      developed in Durham [6], a five-figure deal was agreed with the\u000d\u000a      University, and it was protected by a primary patent (US Patent 7,517,701,\u000d\u000a      3 named Durham inventors) [Im1]. Consecutive direct grant support from the\u000d\u000a      French firm CISbio developed new bright Eu complexes for time-resolved\u000d\u000a      assays protected by 4 patents (most importantly: \"Nouveaux agents\u000d\u000a      complexants et complexes de lanthanide correspondant et leur utilisation\u000d\u000a      comme marquers luminescents\", French Pat.

Initial support\u000d\u000a      was via the EPSRC follow-on-fund (EP\/G004773; &#163;99K) and subsequent support\u000d\u000a      was raised from the regional NStar Finance company (&#163;190K), the Northern\u000d\u000a      Universities N8 METRC fund (&#163;50K), and Ocean Optics Inc. ($10K).

This showed that a distinction could be made between patients with\u000d\u000a      high or intermediate grade prostate cancer from those with low-grade\u000d\u000a      cancer or benign hyperplasia. The first UCLH trial (Mark Emberton,\u000d\u000a      clinical lead, 240 patients) is underway, 80 samples have been measured\u000d\u000a      (Oct. 2013) and it will compare citrate screening with more expensive\u000d\u000a      methods such as those based on MRI and MRSI.\u000d\u000a    International publicity in 2009 [Im5] for the citrate test for prostate\u000d\u000a      cancer raised significant public &amp; commercial awareness.

This\u000d\u000a      allows the distribution of portable spectroscopy equipment to schools\u000d\u000a      throughout the UK. Since September 2010, over 5000 pupils and members of\u000d\u000a      the public have been educated and entertained by 35 on-site demonstrations\u000d\u000a      by a team led by Dr A Beeby. Examples include demonstrations of Eu\u000d\u000a      emission (e.g. on the &#8364;10 note) following UV excitation, and the\u000d\u000a      biomedical applications of emissive complexes are explained to attendees.\u000d\u000a      Durham's research-derived expertise in lanthanide coordination chemistry\u000d\u000a      has also had major impact in the healthcare arena, particularly through\u000d\u000a      changes in FDA regulations surrounding Gd contrast agents used in millions\u000d\u000a      of MRI scans every year. This arose from the key scientific arguments and\u000d\u000a      insight Parker provided between 2008 &amp; 2013 [Im6,8] to Cleveland\u000d\u000a      lawyers developing the plaintiffs' case in a multi-district litigation\u000d\u000a      around the recently defined disease, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).\u000d\u000a    In 1993, Parker stated [8] that macrocyclic contrast agents, \"are more\u000d\u000a      kinetically stable in vivo than DTPA-based ligands, and should\u000d\u000a      avert long term (i.e. chronic, rather than acute) toxicity problems\".\u000d\u000a      These concerns proved prophetic. In 2005\/6, the fatal condition,\u000d\u000a      nephrogenic systemic fibrosis emerged, mostly in diseased renal patients.\u000d\u000a      A link was made to the \"unsafe\" use of DTPA-based Gd contrast agents that\u000d\u000a      are susceptible to acid promoted dissociation, particularly GE\u000d\u000a      Healthcare's Omniscan and the related Optimark product.\u000d\u000a    Durham advised the Ohio law firm involved via an initial 12 page report\u000d\u000a      followed by a formal court deposition involving 8 hours of video\/oral\u000d\u000a      defence in London in September 2010. On January 24 2011 GE Healthcare\u000d\u000a      acknowledged these arguments and settled the first and four subsequent\u000d\u000a      \"bellwether trials\" out of Court; each was linked to scores of cases with\u000d\u000a      undisclosed settlements [Im 6,7]. Parker continued to advise the\u000d\u000a      prosecution for the first case involving a single individual to come to\u000d\u000a      Court in March 2013. The Court asked GE Healthcare to pay $5M to Mr Paul\u000d\u000a      Decker, who had been rendered an invalid following one Omniscan MRI scan\u000d\u000a      in 2005 [Im7,8].\u000d\u000a    In December 2009, the FDA issued new guidelines to the radiology\u000d\u000a      community advising against the use of DTPA based systems in renal\u000d\u000a      patients. This minimised risk to the 40 million patients each year that\u000d\u000a      undergo a Gd-assisted MRI scan. Since its launch, the DTPA-diamide\u000d\u000a      contrast agent Omniscan has been used in over 50 million MRI procedures at\u000d\u000a      a cost of around $30 per scan. Omniscan's share of the Gd contrast agent\u000d\u000a      market fell from 32% in 2005-7 (ca $130M) to just 10% in 2012. Macrocyclic\u000d\u000a      contrast agents are likely to dominate this market in future.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case describes the impact of new emissive metal complexes, the\u000d\u000a      development of associated optical equipment and knowledge dissemination\u000d\u000a      based on lanthanide chemistry. Luminescent lanthanide complexes have been\u000d\u000a      commercialised for drug-screening assays (France, USA); responsive probes\u000d\u000a      have been developed to measure bicarbonate, citrate, lactate and urate in\u000d\u000a      bio-fluids using ratiometric analysis of metal-based emission; and\u000d\u000a      clinical studies are underway assessing the use of citrate as a metabolic\u000d\u000a      marker for prostate cancer.

A mobile phone\u000d\u000a      contains 9 different lanthanide elements (ca 120 mg), and they are widely\u000d\u000a      used in security printing (Eu) and as phosphors in displays (Eu, Tb).\u000d\u000a      Since 1993, Durham research led by Parker (Durham staff 1982-present) and\u000d\u000a      Beeby (Durham staff 1992-present) has addressed the synthesis, structure,\u000d\u000a      mechanism of action and function of lanthanide coordination complexes\u000d\u000a      [1-7]. Applications range from highly emissive lanthanide complexes to\u000d\u000a      paramagnetic complexes of Gd used as contrast agents for MRI. Parker, for\u000d\u000a      example, served as a consultant (1994-2007) for the contrast agent\u000d\u000a      companies, Guerbet (Paris) and Bracco (Milan), and Beeby worked closely\u000d\u000a      with Horiba Jobin-Yvon on instrumentation development (e.g. integrating\u000d\u000a      sphere for quantum yield determinations) to help understand these\u000d\u000a      materials.\u000d\u000a    Luminescent complexes of Eu and Tb whose emission profile is a sensitive\u000d\u000a      function of the local pH, pO2 or concentration of key bioactive\u000d\u000a      anions or macromolecules were created in Durham between 1998 &amp; 2011\u000d\u000a      [1,2]. These typically work via reversible anion binding to the metal\u000d\u000a      centre displacing water and changing the spectral form and relative\u000d\u000a      intensity of the emitted light. Ion affinity and selectivity can be\u000d\u000a      controlled by varying the effective charge and steric demand at the metal\u000d\u000a      centre. Using a mixture of Eu and Tb complexes, or by analysing the\u000d\u000a      intensity ratio of two well-separated bands in the Eu emission spectrum,\u000d\u000a      ratiometric analyses are enabled, allowing accurate calibration (WO\u000d\u000a      2008\/007089, granted 2010 in Europe: EP 2041571 B1; US patent 8,501,398\u000d\u000a      (2013)). This has allowed optical sensors to be devised that can be\u000d\u000a      calibrated to measure directly bicarbonate, urate, lactate and citrate in\u000d\u000a      a variety of bio-fluids including serum, urine and seminal fluid (original\u000d\u000a      filing by Durham University for citrate: US patent 8,193,174 granted\u000d\u000a      05.06.2012; for citrate and lactate: WO 2010\/086615 A1 published in USA as\u000d\u000a      US 2011\/0287558A1 and in Europe as EP 2391610 A0).\u000d\u000a    Factors that limit the optical brightness of these probes have also been\u000d\u000a      studied, especially processes that quench the excited states along the\u000d\u000a      photochemical pathway [4]. For example, details of the quenching of the\u000d\u000a      ligand and metal-based excited states by energy and electron transfer\u000d\u000a      processes were examined, using time-resolved spectroscopic methods.\u000d\u000a      Between 2005 and 2011 the research was extended beyond in vitro\u000d\u000a      work, by developing spectral imaging in optical microscopy of pH and\u000d\u000a      anion-induced changes in cellulo, paving the way for applications\u000d\u000a      in cell biology. New portable optical instrumentation has been developed\u000d\u000a      by Beeby and Dr Robert Pal to measure the optical signal selectively. A\u000d\u000a      hand-held, time-gated emission spectrometer is being developed, in\u000d\u000a      partnership with Ocean Optics (USA) [7]. Ethical approval was given in\u000d\u000a      November 2009 for clinical studies to begin assessing citrate as a\u000d\u000a      screening marker in prostate cancer.\u000d\u000a\u0009  Parker has also been developing the\u000d\u000a      chemistry of contrast agents for MRI since 1991, creating new families of\u000d\u000a      kinetically stable macrocyclic complexes that resist premature\u000d\u000a      dissociation of the metal ion in vivo.

The transfer methods are\u000a      summarized in the flow chart below and an example of impact generated\u000a      through each method is given in the following sections.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a    (a) Income Generated Growth (Surface Innovations Ltd, Durham, UK):\u000a      Atomized-Spray Plasma Deposition (ASPD) described in [6] is capable of\u000a      producing a wide variety of thin, high quality, functional coatings, at\u000a      throughputs attractive to a large number of markets. The approach allows\u000a      lost-cost substrates to exhibit the surface properties and performance of\u000a      far more expensive materials. To exploit this technology Badyal and Dr\u000a      Luke Ward (a former PhD student) founded the IP-ownership company Surface\u000a      Innovations Ltd. in 2001 [Im1]. Durham University agreed to assign\u000a      non-industrially sponsored intellectual property developed within the\u000a      Badyal group to the company in return for an equity stake. 14 core patent\u000a      families were filed during the period 2001-2010 on surface\u000a      functionalization for applications including: filtration; antifogging;\u000a      bioarrays; antibacterial; antifouling; high dielectric constant;\u000a      super-repellency; fog harvesting; and rewritability. The company was\u000a      funded by loans and income generated from prototype development amounting\u000a      to &#163;824K for industrial partners including: Siemens (Germany); Arcelor\u000a      (Belgium); Procter &amp; Gamble (USA); Sauflon (UK); Federal Moghul\u000a      (Luxembourg); Dow Corning (USA); IRD Fuel Cells (Denmark); Kimberly-Clark\u000a      (USA); Gillette (USA); Calgon (USA); Porvair (UK); and SMB Microfluidic\u000a      Devices (Denmark). The company had 5 employees when it was bought out by\u000a      P2i Ltd in July 2010 [Im2] for ca &#163;737K (P2i 2010 Annual report\u000a      [Im8]). The Department's share of the income has been used to fund\u000a      undergraduate research internships in Durham and abroad to highlight\u000a      entrepreneurship opportunities and benefits to our students. Badyal has\u000a      utilized proceeds to help alleviate extreme child poverty in India and\u000a      Africa.\u000a    (b) Corporate Venturing (Dow Corning Plasma Ltd, Cork, Ireland):\u000a      The atomised spray plasmachemical deposition (ASPD) technique developed in\u000a      Durham [5] was patented in collaboration with Dow Corning and a start-up\u000a      company [Im3,Im4] was set up in Ireland with an initial investment of &#8364;3.3\u000a      million made by Dow Corning Corporation (USA). Its managing director was\u000a      Dr Alan Hynes (a former Badyal PhD student). Large scale (up to 2.8 m\u000a      width roll-to-roll) industrial manufacturing machines were built based\u000a      upon the Durham ASPD equipment design and sold for significant sums. The\u000a      company employed 28 people, and in 2008 the business became fully\u000a      integrated into Dow Corning Corporation. Current licensees of the ASPD\u000a      technology include Invexus (USA) which is supplying to the &gt;&#163;2 billion\u000a      global market for antibacterial surfaces.\u000a    (c) Venture Capital (P2i Ltd, Abingdon, UK): In 1996 Badyal was\u000a      approached by the UK MoD concerning the dehydration of British soldiers in\u000a      the desert during the 1990 conflict with Iraq. In particular, the military\u000a      wanted to reduce the number of layers of clothing that soldiers had to\u000a      wear in the battle field. Badyal proposed the utilization of pulsed\u000a      plasmachemical deposition (PPD) which led to the funding of a PhD student\u000a      (Stephen Coulson). The idea was successful, a patent for treating fabric\u000a      was filed (GB Pat Appl. 9712338.4, 1997) and the research published\u000a      [4,Im5,Im6]. Upon completion of his PhD, Stephen Coulson moved to the MoD\u000a      and in 2004 helped found P2i Ltd (UK Company 04814350), where he has\u000a      remained as Chief Technology Officer (CTO). P2i has raised &#163;40 million\u000a      investment from Swarraton Partners, NAXOS Capital Partners, Porton Capital\u000a      Limited, Unilever Ventures, OMBU Group, and the Rainbow Seed Fund,\u000a      including &#163;31.75M since 2008. The company headquarters are in Abingdon,\u000a      and it currently has offices in Savannah (USA), Oregon (USA), Singapore,\u000a      and an applications centre in China. In 2010, having undergone very rapid\u000a      growth, P2i purchased Surface Innovations from DU and Badyal in order to\u000a      broaden its portfolio of functional nanocoatings [Im2,8].\u000a    P2i has built its business by developing and commercialising the Durham\u000a      plasma deposited liquid repellent nanocoatings described in [4]. It has\u000a      commercialised treatments as the Ion Mask&#8482; brand for footwear,\u000a      clothing and accessories, and as Aridion&#8482; for electronics\u000a      applications [Im7]. These ultra-low surface energy nanocoatings impart\u000a      numerous benefits to consumer products. For footwear and filtration media,\u000a      treated products no longer absorb liquids but instead remain dry, clean\u000a      and lightweight. For complex three dimensional products such as\u000a      smartphones, and computer tablets, the low surface energy prevents liquids\u000a      from being drawn into the device by means of capillary action.\u000a\u000aFigure: Some examples of product applications using Durham-derived plasma nanocoatings.\u000a\u000a    Over 150 commercial plasma coatings units based on the Durham design have\u000a      been manufactured by P2i and installed with customers in Argentina,\u000a      Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Spain,\u000a      Thailand, UK, and the USA for the surface treatment of products in the electronics, lifestyle,\u000a      life sciences, filtration,\u000a        energy, military,\u000a        and institutional sectors.

This\u000a      industry has an estimated value of $50 billion per annum and new\u000a      technologies to enhance surface properties of all types of materials are\u000a      highly valued.\u000a    The plasma state was discovered in 1879 by the English scientist William\u000a      Crookes and, despite being used for technological applications such as\u000a      lighting for over 100 years, very little progress had previously been made\u000a      in relation to achieving high chemical reaction pathway selectivities\u000a      within this 4th state of matter. Durham research has, however, developed\u000a      methods to use plasmachemical techniques to selectively functionalise the\u000a      surfaces of a wide range of different materials. Two particular areas of\u000a      research which underpin the impact described in Section 4 are:\u000a    (a) Synthon theory for plasmachemical surface functionalization:\u000a      this theory allows rational prediction of the surface functionalization of\u000a      polymers by electrical gas discharges. It uses a synthon approach to\u000a      correlate the reactivity of chemical groups located at a polymer substrate\u000a      surface with the impinging plasma species. In this way, desired\u000a      functionalities can be incorporated into a surface by the judicious choice\u000a      of electrical discharge and polymer substrate. Structure- behaviour\u000a      relationships were developed which explain the interfacial plasma-solid\u000a      chemical reaction pathways [1,2].\u000a    (b) Structurally well-defined functional nanofilms: Most\u000a      established surface treatment methods are substrate-specific and cannot be\u000a      easily adapted to different materials or geometries (making them no more\u000a      than an academic curiosity in many cases). Durham research showed that\u000a      plasmachemical deposition offers the potential to address this limitation\u000a      by exploiting the inherent substrate activation by the electrical\u000a      discharge prior to the onset of film growth. This allows\u000a      substrate-independent surface functionalization. Furthermore, this\u000a      approach is single-step, solventless, operates at ambient temperature, and\u000a      requires very low energy input. Two methods utilized by Durham have been\u000a      shown to achieve extremely high chemical selectivity at the plasma- solid\u000a      interface during functional nanolayer deposition:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aPulsed Plasmachemical Deposition (PPD): By pulsing the\u000a        electrical discharge on ms-03bcs timescales, two distinct reaction\u000a        regimes can be constructed: firstly activation of precursor molecules by\u000a        UV irradiation, ion, or electron collisions during the plasma duty cycle\u000a        on-period (typically 03bcs), and then conventional chemistry (e.g.\u000a        cyclisation or polymerisation) proceeding in the absence of any damaging\u000a        plasma species during a much longer off-period (typically ms). This has\u000a        been shown to lead to extremely high levels of surface functionality\u000a        [3,4].\u000a      \u000aAtomised Spray Plasma Deposition (ASPD):\u000a        Structurally well-defined functional nanofilms can also be obtained by\u000a        the nebulisation of precursor molecules into an electrical discharge.\u000a        Mechanistically, this proceeds by highly excited metastable atoms\u000a        possessing sufficient energies to activate precursor molecules (Penning\u000a        type reactions) which initiate conventional chemical reaction pathways\u000a        during the impact of the supersonically expanding atomised liquid\u000a        droplets onto the substrate surface [5]. It has also been shown that\u000a        well-defined nanocomposite films can be created by utilizing\u000a        nanoparticle slurries [6].\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11779","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Medical Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The global research market for cell culture is estimated to be worth\u000a      $600m annually and is growing at 10% a year.

The syntheses of the\u000a      retinoid compounds were scaled-up and manufactured at High Force Research\u000a      Ltd (Durham) and are currently marketed through Reinnervate's commercial\u000a      partners including Tocris, Enzo Life Sciences, LGC Standards and Amsbio as\u000a      ec23&#174; [Im2].\u000a    The 3D polyHIPE scaffolds derived from porous polystyrene described in\u000a      references [5] and [6] were patented by DU (WO200712588 \"Substrate for\u000a      growth of cultured cell in three dimensions\", Przyborski &amp; Cameron)\u000a      and the IP assigned to Reinnervate. An extensive development phase within\u000a      Reinnervate, involving re-engineering and scale-up of the technology,\u000a      optimization for 3D cell culture and development of further applications\u000a      of the 3D scaffolds in bioscience was carried out. This allowed creation\u000a      of the first Alvetex&#174; products which were launched in November 2010 [Im3].\u000a      Since the first scaffold entered the market (see Figure), several other\u000a      formats of the technology such as a 12-well, 24-well and 96-well culture\u000a      plate and 6\/12-well inserts were introduced. There are currently 18\u000a      distributors including ThermoFisher Scientific, Generon (UK), Biozol GmbH\u000a      (Germany), Chemie Brunschwig AG (Switzerland), THP Medical Products\u000a      (Austria), In Vitro AS (Denmark), Euroclone (Italy), and Bio Connect (the\u000a      Benelux region) that market the Alvetex&#174; brand in different territories\u000a      around the world and over 1500 customers world-wide. Growing sales\u000a      currently amount on average to approximately &#163;15K per month for the first\u000a      two quarters of 2013.\u000a    \u000a    \u000a    \u000a   \u000a  Figure: porous polystyrene Alvetex&#174; 3D scaffold microstructure (left) and marketed 96-well plate format for cell culture studies (right)\u000a  \u000a\u000a    The ultimate beneficiaries of these developments are the life science end\u000a      users who buy and use the scaffold technology. Whilst some of the\u000a      technologies are specialised and will benefit discrete groups of\u000a      scientists (e.g. stem cell differentiation, cancer cell biology), other\u000a      products are more generic, and have far greater penetration and use (e.g.\u000a      3D cell culture &#8212; applicable to almost any cell biologist currently\u000a      practising conventional 2D culture techniques). Improving the growth,\u000a      differentiation and function of cultured cells has many advantages,\u000a      including decreasing R&amp;D costs, reducing animal usage, improving the\u000a      predictive accuracy during development of drug candidates, and advancing\u000a      basic research.\u000a    A published BBSRC Impact evidence report [Im4] confirms that \"Reinnervate\u000a      now has more than 1,500 customers around the world, including cell\u000a      biologists and other researchers in academic institutions, government\u000a      labs, hospitals and the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, making it a\u000a      leading company in the 3D cell-culture market.

This methodology was improved through the application\u000a      of synthetic retinoids designed in collaboration with Profs Whiting and\u000a      Marder. Whilst naturally occurring retinoids may be used in a variety of\u000a      cell differentiation techniques, their inherent instability due to\u000a      isomerisation in culture media provides opportunities for the use of\u000a      synthetic retinoids that can control cellular development but also have\u000a      long term stability. A new class of synthetic retinoids was designed and\u000a      synthesised at Durham [1] in which an arene carboxylic acid, acetylene and\u000a      saturated ring replaced the normal retinoic acid system. These retinoids\u000a      were found to be stable to degradation over extended periods under normal\u000a      laboratory conditions. The ability of the synthetic retinoids to modulate\u000a      tissue development, particularly the induction of cell differentiation in\u000a      a stem cell model of human embryogenesis, was demonstrated [1].\u000a    Research into mechanisms controlling stem cell differentiation in\u000a        vitro and the beneficial formation of 3D neuroprogenitor aggregates\u000a      by the Przyborski group led to the concept of developing technology that\u000a      would enable the study of cultured cells in 3D models. The shape and\u000a      function of a cultured cell is significantly affected by the physical\u000a      environment in which it grows. Cells grown in two dimensions have a large\u000a      proportion of their surface exposed to the typically flat polystyrene\u000a      substrate surface and interaction between adjacent cells is therefore\u000a      localised primarily to their edges. In a 3D scaffold system, however,\u000a      there is significantly greater scope for cell interaction and signalling\u000a      which more accurately resembles how cells constitute a tissue, providing\u000a      far more precise information about cell function. Such in vitro\u000a      assays and models are more effective at modelling the in vivo\u000a      growth of cells. A suitable sterile, inert, solid scaffold would offer\u000a      several advantages to scientists for 3D cell culture growth including\u000a      reproducibility, robustness, stability and reduced sample preparation\u000a      time.\u000a    Cameron's research in materials chemistry has a strong focus on the\u000a      preparation and application of polymers synthesised by high internal phase\u000a      emulsion (polyHIPE) techniques [2]. Following discussions as part of an\u000a      internal DU Bioactive Chemistry Centre symposium, Cameron and Przyborski\u000a      recognised that polyHIPEs offered excellent potential as scaffolds for 3D\u000a      cell culture since the high porosity of the materials would allow healthy\u000a      cells to grow within a network of size-controlled pores in the solid\u000a      polymeric material. Research funded by an EPSRC grant awarded to\u000a      Professors Przyborski and Cameron (GR\/T24043) allowed initial proof of\u000a      concept research to demonstrate the effectiveness of new 3D polyHIPEs with\u000a      tailored morphology synthesised by emulsion templating [3,4]. The cells\u000a      cultured in the pores of the 3D polyHIPE material were not only more\u000a      functional, but also expressed different proteins which act as markers of\u000a      neural network development compared to cells grown in conventional 2D\u000a      culture. Further optimisation enabled polystyrene-based scaffold materials\u000a      to be tailored to provide improved 3D polyHIPE supports [5] and the\u000a      engineering of polyHIPE materials into thin membranes [6]. In all cases,\u000a      cells cultured in 3D were shown to be more functional and more viable than\u000a      those grown in 2D culture.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18127","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The breakthrough discoveries on oxygenases have had specific impacts\u000a      including the following.\u000a    Identification\/validation of new drug targets for diseases ranging\u000a        from anaemia to cancer that are being pursued by multiple companies [7 -\u000a        10].\u000a    Enabling work in the Oxford University laboratories (1996-2002) followed\u000a      by that in the spin-out ReOx (2002 onwards), demonstrated that\u000a      small-molecule mediated inhibition of the HIF prolyl-hydroxylases\u000a      upregulates proteins of major medicinal relevance (e.g. EPO and vascular\u000a      endothelial growth factor, VEGF), thus validating the HIF hydroxylases as\u000a      drug targets (see Section 2).

Studies on bacterial enzymes in antibiotic biosynthesis resulted\u000a      in pioneering structure determinations including of substrate complexes\u000a      for oxygenases, e.g. [1]. With a desire to apply their skills to human\u000a      biology and disease the group focused its activities (1996 onwards) to\u000a      address mechanisms, structures and functions of the f07e60 human\u000a      2-oxoglutarate (2OG) oxygenses with assigned and unassigned roles (at the\u000a      time the majority were unassigned). Initial work on oxygenases involved in\u000a      chlorophyll metabolism resulted in pathophysiological insights by\u000a      correlating chemical and clinical data. This work placed the group in an\u000a      excellent position to address functions of unassigned 2OG oxygenases in an\u000a      interdisciplinary approach employing synthesis, biochemistry, structural\u000a      and cell biology, methods of genetic and chemical intervention,\u000a      structure-informed bioinformatics, and clinical data. The results have had\u000a      major impact by identifying new signalling mechanisms and therapeutic\u000a      targets. Studies on metabolic oxygenases included assignment of the\u000a      fat-mass and obesity-associated protein FTO (mutations of which correlate\u000a      with obesity) as a demethylase [2], raising the possibility that\u000a      metabolism is regulated by nucleic acid methylation, a finding that has\u000a      stimulated research worldwide.\u000a    Working with Peter Ratcliffe (Dept of Medicine, Oxford University), a\u000a      joint programme from 2000 onwards was initiated to elucidate molecular\u000a      mechanisms by which animals respond to hypoxia, a long-standing\u000a      physiological problem. Arising in this programme, the finding that\u000a      oxygenases act as oxygen sensors [3 - 5] was a landmark discovery\u000a      (&gt;&gt; 10000 citations for related papers). Following the discovery\u000a      that the hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIF) are O2\u000a      regulated (by Semenza in the U.S.), an objective was to identify\u000a      mechanisms of O2 -dependent HIF-degradation.\u000a      Prolyl-hydroxylation was shown to regulate HIF levels, via increasing its\u000a      binding to the von Hippel-Lindau protein, a ubiquitin ligase component.\u000a      Structural knowledge enabled identification of candidates encoding for HIF\u000a      prolyl-hydroxylases, leading to identification of 3 human HIF hydroxylase\u000a      enzymes, PHD1-3, which act as hypoxia sensors [3]. When O2 is\u000a      limiting, HIF-hydroxylation slows, causing its concentration to rise, so\u000a      triggering the hypoxic response. Crucially, work of the Oxford University\u000a      team in 2000 demonstrated that small-molecules (developed by Oxford\u000a      Chemistry) mediate HIF prolyl-hydroxylase inhibition, leading to\u000a      upregulation of HIF target genes, including those of major therapeutic\u000a      benefit such as erythropoietin (EPO).\u000a    Following the finding that O2-dependent HIF Asn hydroxylation\u000a      reduces its transcriptional activity, Oxford work revealed that\u000a      factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH), a JmjC protein, is the HIF Asn-hydroxylase\u000a      [4]. Contrary to the paradigm, subsequent work demonstrated that\u000a      hydroxylation of intracellularly localised proteins is common, opening a\u000a      new protein-research field. Sequence analyses, informed by structures\u000a      determined in Oxford, revealed that many genes encode for oxygenases\u000a      involved in chromatin regulation. Following the discovery that many JmjC\u000a      enzymes are histone demethylases, a programme to investigate oxygenase\u000a      roles in epigenetics was initiated. Highlights include structures for\u000a      demethylases complexed with substrates, discovery of splicing factor\u000a      hydroxylases, identification of a demethylase associated with X-linked\u000a      mental retardation \/ cleft lip palate diseases [6], and of the ribosomal\u000a      oxygenases. The collective results suggest all steps in protein expression\u000a      are regulated by oxygen availability, and have opened up new therapeutic\u000a      targets.\u000a    Key Oxford University contributors: C.J.

Interest focussed particularly on the\u000a      objectivity and precision of the measurements obtained, and on the greatly\u000a      reduced costs in contrast to the traditional method of using teams of\u000a      tasters [8, 9]. Isis Innovation prepared the chilli sensor project for\u000a      commercialisation, and the English Provender Company (EPC) subsequently\u000a      expressed an interest in the technology for commercial purposes. Using\u000a      EPSRC Pathway to Impact funds, prototypes were built and a PDRA employed\u000a      to assist with field trials. The Compton group showed EPC staff how to use\u000a      the tester on their food samples, and followed up with several visits to\u000a      monitor progress. Isis licensed the technology to EPC on a non-exclusive\u000a      basis in 2012 [10].\u000a    EPC, a company with a turnover of &#163; 63.6 M in 2012 and 323 employees\u000a      [11], produces a wide range of sauces and condiments for use in domestic\u000a      food, such as their Very Lazy range of pre-prepared ingredients, and is a\u000a      key supplier of ready meals for the UK's major food retailers. It makes\u000a      around 250 tonnes of cooked products (ready meals) each month containing\u000a      chilli, and approximately 200,000 jars of chilli-containing foods.\u000a      Typically it uses up to 10 tonnes of chillies every month, which vary\u000a      dramatically in heat; there is thus a need to ensure consistency in both\u000a      raw materials and finished product. Extensive tests by EPC in its\u000a      production facilities confirmed that Compton's electrochemical device was\u000a      accurate and reliable and matched Scoville Test results, a key part of\u000a      validating the device and convincing the industry to use the method.\u000a      Following this, EPC has routinely used the sensor as a quality assurance\u000a      monitor on the incoming raw ingredients. The company can now offer its\u000a      customers (which include Marks and Spencer, 2 Sisters Food Group and\u000a      Greencore Group) improved consistency in the products it delivers, and\u000a      this has been well received by the customers concerned [12]. According to\u000a      the Head of Technical at EPC, `the device [chilli tester] has a\u000a        massive place in our future'.\u000a    In February 2013 the Singapore-based company Bio-X (S) Pte. Ltd. obtained\u000a      an exclusive licence for the chilli sensor patent in Asia-Pacific and a\u000a      non-exclusive licence in the rest of the world (again through Isis\u000a      Innovation). Bio-X works with technologies and products (including\u000a      chemical sensors) targeted at the measurement of spiciness in food, and\u000a      aims to establish standardisation for heat in the food industry. Following\u000a      licensing, Bio-X is designing and building a new commercially available\u000a      chilli sensor, and demonstration units have been sold prior to full-scale\u000a      launch. Nestl&#233; have been involved in a trial in which data from Bio-X's\u000a      Chilli Tester matched with their own data from high performance liquid\u000a      chromatography &#8212; an extremely promising outcome [13, 14]. The CEO of Bio-X\u000a      has stated the advantages to them of the chilli sensor technology: `Both\u000a        suppliers and users of chillies can be assured of the quality by using a\u000a        simple handheld device. Initially, we expect to see the Chilli Tester\u000a        being used by food manufacturers to determine the quality of their raw\u000a        materials and chilli farms to grade their products &#8212; but the real\u000a        potential of the Chilli Tester will be realised in giving the consumer a\u000a        number that they can use in deciding on sauces and other food products.'\u000a      [10]\u000a    The science behind the chilli sensors has been the subject of significant\u000a      outreach activities at several UK schools. Since July 2012 a consortium of\u000a      seven Yorkshire schools, led by Shelley College in Huddersfield and also\u000a      involving the University of Huddersfield, has been engaged in an ongoing\u000a      collaboration and outreach programme with the Compton group, aimed at\u000a      increasing science applications from such students to research-intensive\u000a      universities. Students aged 14-15 have successfully used research-level\u000a      equipment based on the technology described in section 2 to investigate\u000a      capsaicin levels in fresh chillies and chilli products. They have also\u000a      used Compton's voltammetry techniques to investigate and quantify the\u000a      amount of ascorbic acid in supplements and soft drinks. The programme has\u000a      now expanded to incorporate a chilli-growing project, and selected\u000a      students have taken part in residential visits to Oxford. The links with\u000a      the GCSE chemistry curriculum are significant and include reinforcement of\u000a      topics such as atomic structure and bonding, ionic compounds, covalent\u000a      structures (carbon), electrolysis, redox reactions and nanoscience. In\u000a      practical terms the activities give students the chance to improve skills\u000a      in risk assessment, collection of data, processing and interpreting data,\u000a      and development of hypotheses and explanations. In addition it assists in\u000a      preparing them for aspects of the A level Chemistry syllabus, especially\u000a      in the topics identified above.\u000a    The Director of Science at Shelley College confirms that the programme is\u000a      encouraging more students to pursue chemistry seriously: `The students\u000a        from Shelley and the other schools involved in the project could not be\u000a        more enthusiastic about taking their [chemistry] studies further. The\u000a        whole nation recognises the importance of producing first class\u000a        scientists for the future and this project is helping to further that\u000a        aim in a way that should not be underestimated.' The outreach has\u000a      been supported by funds from St John's College and the Department of\u000a      Chemistry, University of Oxford, and from the Royal Society of Chemistry\u000a      [15].\u000a    A second schools programme started in early 2013 at Cheltenham Ladies\u000a      College in Gloucestershire, aided by a Partnership Grant from the Royal\u000a      Society. Again, with active support from the Compton group, students have\u000a      used the techniques described in the research section to devise their own\u000a      experiments investigating capsaicin levels within chilli plants (the\u000a      strength of dried versus fresh chillies, and which solvent will extract\u000a      capsaicin more readily). The College's Head of Chemistry feels the project\u000a      `has helped push science to the top of the school agenda. A significant\u000a        proportion of the school's cohort has become engaged with the project.'\u000a      In addition the Cheltenham students have particularly benefited from the\u000a      high proportion of female researchers from the Compton group visiting the\u000a      school, which has `served as an excellent motivator for young female\u000a        scientists' [16].\u000a    Over 100 students in all have so far taken part across the schools\u000a      involved, and both programmes are continuing.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Richard Compton's group at the University of Oxford has developed an\u000a      electrochemical sensor which uses multi-walled carbon nanotube electrodes\u000a      to detect capsaicin molecules and related capsaicinoids &#8212; the chemicals\u000a      responsible for the hot taste of chilli peppers.

Chillies are used ubiquitously throughout the food\u000a      industry, and in order to ensure consistency there is a need to assess\u000a      chilli strength &#8212; or, more technically, capsaicin content. Such\u000a      measurements are traditionally performed using organoleptic (taste)\u000a      testing: chilli pepper extract is diluted in sugar solution until the\u000a      `heat' is no longer detectable to a panel of five tasters. The degree of\u000a      dilution gives a measurement on the Scoville scale, which dates back to\u000a      1912, and yields numbers which range from 0 to 16,000,000. By means of\u000a      illustration, a Jalapeno pepper scores 2,500, Tabasco sauce 30,000-50,000,\u000a      and pure capsaicin 16,000,000. The Scoville test can give accurate results\u000a      when performed by expert tasters. However results are entirely dependent\u000a      on the capsaicin sensitivity of the tasters, and the test is\u000a      time-consuming and costly to perform since it requires a panel of five\u000a      experts for every measurement of chilli heat. More consistent scientific\u000a      methods of measuring capsaicin content involve cumbersome and expensive\u000a      high-performance liquid chromatographs, which also require trained staff\u000a      and involve time for sample preparation and results analysis.\u000a    In the mid-2000s Richard Compton and colleagues in the Department of\u000a      Chemistry, University of Oxford began to undertake fundamental studies of\u000a      adsorptive stripping voltammetry (AdSV) at multiwalled carbon nanotube\u000a      modified basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes (MWCNT-BPPGE) &#8212;\u000a      electrodes coated in carbon nanotubes. The Compton group applied the\u000a      technique to a variety of analytes; with paracetamol [1] they obtained a\u000a      detection limit of 10 nM, almost certainly the lowest limit of detection\u000a      thus far reported for paracetamol using electrochemical techniques,\u000a      showing that the technique was extremely sensitive. In a similar study on\u000a      4-hexylresorcinol (an anaesthetic and antiseptic used in pharmaceutical\u000a      products) [2], Compton and colleagues experimented with MWCNT-BPPGE\u000a      modified screen-printed electrodes, thereby demonstrating that the AdSV\u000a      technique could easily be incorporated into a simple and inexpensive\u000a      electrochemical sensor.\u000a    Compton and colleagues also studied food anayltes, specifically capsaicin\u000a      molecules, which they observed to spontaneously adsorb onto a MWCNT-BPPGE.\u000a      Further, when the voltage at the electrode was adjusted appropriately, the\u000a      molecules were oxidised and stripped from its surface. This finding led to\u000a      the development of an AdSV technique which built on the fact that, if\u000a      deposition and stripping conditions were kept constant, the process could\u000a      be calibrated to link the voltammetric stripping current to solution\u000a      concentration [3]. The Compton group then developed an innovative\u000a      electrochemical technique to reliably quantify the concentration of\u000a      capsaicin in a sample.\u000a    The technique was refined by the group so that the multi-wall carbon\u000a      nanotube-based electrode could be screen-printed and used with a hand-held\u000a      sensor to assess capsaicin concentration outside the laboratory. To use\u000a      the device, food extracts containing chilli are diluted in a ratio of\u000a      1:100 with 0.05M Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 1.0 and then placed on the\u000a      carbon nanotube electrode. The voltage is scanned, and the variation in\u000a      voltammetric stripping current is recorded. The result is then converted\u000a      into a measurement corresponding to the Scoville scale. The technology was\u000a      patented in 2008 by Isis Innovation Ltd, the University of Oxford's\u000a      technology transfer division [4].\u000a    The Compton group also developed a similar electrochemical technique\u000a      using carbon-based electrodes to measure the strength of garlic by\u000a      identifying the presence of disulfides [5]. This technology was patented\u000a      in the UK, and by Isis Innovation, in 2010 [6].\u000a    Richard Compton has been on the academic staff of the Department of\u000a      Chemistry from 1985 to the present day.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18129","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described above has underpinned the formation of a very\u000a      successful company, Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), which has attracted\u000a      more than &#163; 105M investment, &#163; 97.8M of this since 1st January 2008. This\u000a      very high level of investment arises as a direct result of ONT's\u000a      pioneering technology, which has the potential to revolutionise the fields\u000a      of DNA sequencing and single-molecule analysis.\u000a    ONT was spun-out of the Department of Chemistry in 2005, founded on\u000a      intellectual property from the University of Oxford, to exploit the\u000a      technology developed by the Bayley laboratory and develop it into a\u000a      robust, commercial product. From the outset the company aimed to create\u000a      `disruptive technology' (one that establishes an entirely new market or\u000a      new behaviours in an existing market, thus disrupting the old one). From\u000a      2008 onwards, ONT forged collaborations with leading nanopore researchers\u000a      at other institutions including Harvard University, the University of\u000a      California Santa Cruz and Boston University, in addition to the company's\u000a      existing relationship with the University of Oxford. This work has\u000a      generated an IP portfolio for the company comprising &gt;300 issued\u000a      patents and patent applications in &gt;80 patent families, including 12\u000a      key patents arising from Bayley's work at Oxford [7]. A new agreement in\u000a      2010, renewed in 2012, strengthened ONT's collaboration with the\u000a      University of Oxford through funding (&gt;&#163; 2M) for the Bayley laboratory.\u000a      The deliberate decision to engage multiple institutions with relevant IP\u000a      has given ONT a world-leading position in nanopore sensing and ensured\u000a      that a UK-based company stands to profit from the enormous potential of\u000a      this technology, with associated benefits to the UK economy.\u000a    In February 2012, ONT revealed the GridION system at the Advances in\u000a      Genome Biology and Technology conference in Florida. GridION is a\u000a      nanopore-based platform that utilises key elements of Bayley's research,\u000a      in addition to research from other ONT partners. The primary emphasis of\u000a      GridION is efficient DNA\/RNA strand sequencing (efficient both in time and\u000a      cost), but it can also be adapted for the direct electronic analysis of\u000a      target proteins, with applications in the discovery and validation of\u000a      disease biomarkers and the development of subsequent diagnostics (e.g. in\u000a      relation to drug response or status of a disease). ONT has revealed that\u000a      the technology within the GridION platform can be miniaturised into\u000a      MinION, a portable device for electronic single-molecule sensing that\u000a      plugs into a PC and is the size of a USB memory stick. These devices\u000a      measure single molecules directly, without the need for amplification of\u000a      the target molecule, fluorescent or chemical labelling, or optical\u000a      instrumentation; in addition analysis of data can be performed in real\u000a      time, and multiple nanopore measurements can be made in parallel, making\u000a      it both cheaper and faster than current sequencing technologies [8].\u000a      MinION will be made available to selected researchers to use, assess and\u000a      evaluate from late November 2013 [9].\u000a    Currently, ONT's nanopore-sensing technology is the only near-market\u000a      method which looks set to break the $ 1,000 barrier (it is expected that\u000a      MinION will be marketed at around $ 900), and importantly it will provide\u000a      extremely fast and robust sequencing, differentiating it from other\u000a      sequencing technologies [9]. ONT calculates that if 20 of its\u000a      second-generation GridION nodes were used together, a human genome could\u000a      be sequenced in 15 minutes at a highly competitive cost (since the\u000a      single-molecule techniques developed at ONT do not require the cyclic\u000a      addition of reagents) [9]. Application of this technology will not just be\u000a      in human health and personalised medicine but also in agriculture and crop\u000a      science, environmental science (e.g. detection of toxins in water), energy\u000a      and defence (e.g. detection of explosives). The potential global market\u000a      for `next generation sequencing' is significant: in 2012 it stood at $\u000a      232M and is expected by market researchers such as BCC Research to be\u000a      approximately $ 7.6bn by 2018. The announcement of GridION and MinION\u000a      attracted considerable worldwide media attention from national and\u000a      international newspapers including the New York Times, Guardian, Sunday\u000a      Times and Financial Times, as well as from scientific journals including\u000a      Science. These reports highlighted the low cost and high speed of ONT's\u000a      devices, and the two sequencers were described as `impressive, credible,\u000a      possibly amazing' and as a potential `game-changer' [10, 11].\u000a    The enormous potential of ONT's new technology, coupled with its wide\u000a      intellectual property portfolio and product pipeline, has generated a very\u000a      high level of investment during the impact period. Seed funding that\u000a      enabled ONT to be established was obtained in two rounds from IP Group in\u000a      2005, and in June 2006 the company raised &#163; 7.75M. Since 1st January 2008,\u000a      ONT has raised a further &#163; 97.8M (representing 92% of total investment\u000a      since company start-up) from a range of sources in the UK and the US. Over\u000a      a third of this (&#163; 34.1M) was raised in May 2012 almost entirely from\u000a      existing investors in the company &#8212; a clear indication of the extent to\u000a      which investors see the potential for GridION and MinION to become highly\u000a      successful. ONT is currently well funded for the next phase of corporate\u000a      development [12].\u000a    The success of ONT is also reflected in its workforce. During the impact\u000a      period the number of people ONT employed increased nearly 6-fold, from 25\u000a      in 2008 to 145 in July 2013. The vast majority of current staff are\u000a      employed in research and development; they have backgrounds in multiple\u000a      disciplines including nanopore science, molecular biology and\u000a      applications, informatics, engineering, electronics, manufacturing and\u000a      commercialisation. ONT has UK offices in Oxford and Cambridge and US\u000a      offices in Boston and New York, and is building a commercial team in\u000a      advance of the launch of the products. Since 2008, ONT has also benefited\u000a      from the transfer of 3 highly-skilled staff from the Bayley laboratory.\u000a      Two of these bring academic research expertise to an industrial R&amp;D\u000a      setting and work in application development and advanced research, and the\u000a      third works for ONT's IP team [9]. The company was valued at $ 2bn by a\u000a      Numis Securities analyst in November 2012 [13].\u000a    ONT made an important contribution to the 2008 - 09 House of Lords\u000a      Science and Technology Committee session on Genomic Medicine. ONT provided\u000a      evidence to the effect that the new technologies were advancing so rapidly\u000a      that the government needed to take action. This evidence helped to shape\u000a      the recommendations in the 2009 final report [14], which are now being\u000a      taken forward by the Government (for example, via the Human Genomics\u000a      Strategy Group, established by the government to address questions raised\u000a      by the report [15]). This influence further reflects ONT as a pioneering\u000a      leader in the field of new generation sequencing.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Hagan Bayley's research on nanopore sensing for DNA sequencing at the\u000a      University of Oxford led to the formation of the spin-out company Oxford\u000a      Nanopore Technologies Ltd (ONT) in 2005.

However, it is\u000a      currently an expensive and time-consuming enterprise. In 2004, the US\u000a      National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) announced a series of\u000a      grants to support research with the aim of sequencing a human genome for\u000a      the cost of $ 1000 or less. At this cost, the technology should become\u000a      affordable enough to enable routine use in personalised medicine. The\u000a      speed and reliability of sequencing is also important for use in the\u000a      clinic. Conventional high-throughput sequencing technologies are\u000a      relatively slow; most require DNA samples to be amplified, cut to an\u000a      appropriate length, attached to a bead or surface and labelled with a\u000a      fluorescent tag which is read with expensive optical imaging equipment.\u000a      There is thus a need for `new generation sequencing' technologies which\u000a      use different approaches to sequencing and can therefore transform the\u000a      speed and reliability of genome sequencing, and hence the utility of\u000a      `personal' genome sequencing.\u000a    Hagan Bayley joined the Department of Chemistry in 2003 to carry out\u000a      fundamental research on membrane proteins. His research led to\u000a      breakthrough developments in the area of `new generation DNA sequencing';\u000a      specifically, his group worked on perfecting techniques to permit the\u000a      sensing of individual molecules using engineered membrane protein pores.\u000a      Bayley established that staphylococcal alpha-haemolysin, a bacterial\u000a      pore-forming toxin, could be modified by protein engineering to bind a\u000a      wide variety of partial blockers and that these pores might be used to\u000a      detect many different analytes at the single-molecule level. For example,\u000a      a paper published in 2005 (with researchers at Texas A&amp;M University)\u000a      demonstrated how an engineered pore could be used to detect binding events\u000a      to monitor the concentration of a critical cell signalling enzyme,\u000a      cAMP-dependent protein kinase [1]. This research built on previous work by\u000a      Bayley at Texas A&amp;M on the assembly, structure and functional\u000a      properties of the alpha-haemolysin protein pore, and made use of the\u000a      technique of `stochastic sensing', in which the modulation by an analyte\u000a      of the ionic current flowing through a single protein pore produces a\u000a      signal that reveals both the concentration of the analyte and its\u000a      identity. Bayley has also used stochastic sensing to distinguish between\u000a      enantiomeric drug molecules. In 2005, Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd\u000a      (ONT) was formed to support and further translate his research to\u000a      applications in sequencing and sensing.\u000a    The work on engineered pores suggested that DNA and RNA might be\u000a      sequenced by pulling single DNA strands through a nanopore and detecting\u000a      nucleobases (including non-canonical bases) through their different\u000a      effects on the ion current passing through the channel pore. In 2006, a\u000a      breakthrough paper from the Bayley group demonstrated for the first time\u000a      that the four bases of DNA could be distinguished using an\u000a      alpha-haemolysin pore equipped with a cyclodextrin adapter [2]. Following\u000a      this result, in 2009 -10 his group addressed one of the key issues in\u000a      strand sequencing: the need to be able to sense several different DNA\u000a      bases within the nanopore at once. The group showed for the first time\u000a      that an alpha-haemolysin pore could be engineered to contain more than one\u000a      recognition site, and thus identify groups of different nucleobases\u000a      simultaneously in an immobilised DNA strand [3, 4]. This marked a\u000a      critically important step towards continuous strand sequencing.\u000a    In 2010, the Bayley group demonstrated that it was possible to create\u000a      solid-state nanopores suitable for integration into wafer-scale devices,\u000a      by attaching a double strand of DNA to a single alpha-haemolysin pore and\u000a      threading it into a solid-state nanopore by electrophoretic translocation.\u000a      This research, in collaboration with Delft University of Technology,\u000a      showed that the hybrid nanopore remained functional in terms of ability to\u000a      sense individual DNA molecules [5]. It formed the foundation for the\u000a      development of ONT's GridION and MinION devices for electronic single\u000a      molecule sensing and DNA and RNA sequencing. In parallel with the\u000a      DNA-focused research, the Bayley group has worked on similar methods to\u000a      enable nanopore sensing of protein molecules [1].\u000a    In 2005, the Bayley laboratory was awarded an NHGRI `$ 1,000 Genome'\u000a      grant, which was renewed in 2010 &#8212; the only such grant outside the USA.\u000a      The total award has been in the region of US$ 10M. In 2009, Bayley was\u000a      awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry World Entrepreneur of the Year\u000a      Award in recognition of his contribution to the commercialisation of\u000a      nanopore research.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18137","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The calibration-free pH measurement system invented by the Compton group\u000a      is a truly innovative\u000a      technology which represents a landmark in the field of pH sensing.

The standard apparatus for measuring pH\u000a      has not changed\u000a      significantly since it was developed by Beckman in the 1930s, and consists\u000a      of a glass electrode\u000a      connected to an electronic meter that measures and displays the pH\u000a      reading. The electrodes are\u000a      expensive and fragile, pH measurements are easily corrupted, and for\u000a      precise work the meter\u000a      needs calibration before every single measurement. Over the past eight\u000a      decades, vast amounts of\u000a      time (and therefore money) have been spent on pH meter calibration in both\u000a      academia and\u000a      industry. Incorrect calibration and other errors can also lead to huge\u000a      costs for companies in terms\u000a      of wasted supplies and products. These factors underline the pressing need\u000a      for a pH meter that\u000a      does not require calibration.\u000a    In 2001, Professor Richard Compton (Department of Chemistry, 1985 -\u000a      present) and his research\u000a      group at the University of Oxford sought to establish if it was possible\u000a      to derivatise carbon\u000a      nanotubes coated on an electrode surface in a way that made them\u000a      reproducibly and predictably\u000a      pH responsive. If his team could identify a molecule whose electrochemical\u000a      properties varied\u000a      consistently with pH, Compton believed it would be possible to create a\u000a      new breed of pH sensors.\u000a      Compton's team demonstrated that anthraquinone-derivatised carbon\u000a      (AQcarbon) nanotube\u000a      surfaces were in fact pH sensitive, accepting protons as pH conditions\u000a      changed and hence\u000a      exhibiting changing electrochemical properties. His team developed a\u000a      simple pH probe based upon\u000a      the covalent derivatisation of carbon particles with anthraquinone, and\u000a      found that its amperometric\u000a      response provided a Nernstian, linear response over the pH range 1 - 14\u000a      and over a temperature\u000a      range from 20 - 70&#176;C [1, 2, 5].\u000a    The broad range of observed pH sensitivity using AQcarbon suggested that\u000a      an effective,\u000a      calibration-free pH sensor could be created. Compton and his team\u000a      developed electrodes which\u000a      were coated with carbon nanotubes functionalised with anthraquinone.\u000a      Alongside, they also\u000a      developed redox probes which were rigorously pH insensitive when similarly\u000a      deployed. Then, by\u000a      modifying electrodes with both pH sensitive and pH insensitive probes and\u000a      measuring the potential\u000a      difference between the two signals, it was possible to directly assess the\u000a      pH of the solution in\u000a      which the electrodes were immersed [3]. The research described in [1], [2]\u000a      and [3] was conducted\u000a      in collaboration with Schlumberger.\u000a    Compton and his team showed that the AQcarbon pH measurement technique\u000a      has distinct\u000a      advantages over existing glass electrodes. Firstly, the amperometric\u000a      signal shows a linear\u000a      relationship with the tiny currents used, which offers far higher\u000a      sensitivity than the logarithmic\u000a      voltage relationships exhibited by potentiometric glass electrodes.\u000a      Secondly, it is unaffected by\u000a      alkali errors which can corrupt the results provided by present\u000a      techniques. Thirdly (and most\u000a      importantly), because it is a potential difference that is measured, the\u000a      need for an ultra-stable\u000a      reference electrode is eliminated, in turn leading to calibration-free pH\u000a      measurement. Combined\u000a      with practical benefits &#8212; such as durability and speed &#8212; the newfound\u000a      theoretical insights provided\u000a      a promising springboard for the development of a new, revolutionary,\u000a      `disruptive' technology for pH\u000a      sensing. For these reasons, the concept was patented in 2005 by Richard\u000a      Compton and Isis\u000a      Innovation Ltd., the technology transfer arm of the University of Oxford\u000a      [4].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18138","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 2008 the research of the Compton group in the field of\u000d\u000a      heterogeneous reaction mechanisms has had a significant impact at Syngenta\u000d\u000a      AG, the company with which it has collaborated. Syngenta is the world's\u000d\u000a      biggest manufacturer of crop chemicals and a major global supplier of\u000d\u000a      insecticides, fungicides and herbicides. In 2012 it achieved sales of $\u000d\u000a      14.2 billion [6]; fungicides alone accounted for 23% &#8212; over $ 3 billion &#8212;\u000d\u000a      of total revenues [7] and insecticides for $ 1.8 billion [8].\u000d\u000a      Azoxystrobin, sold by Syngenta principally under the trade name Amistar,\u000d\u000a      is the world's leading fungicide by sales, while thiamethoxam is the\u000d\u000a      active ingredient developed by Syngenta and used in its product Actara,\u000d\u000a      the best selling insecticide worldwide. Manufacturing processes for both\u000d\u000a      these products, as well as others made by Syngenta, have benefited from\u000d\u000a      important changes as a result of the Compton group research. In the words\u000d\u000a      of a Senior Fellow at Syngenta UK, \"The fundamental science behind the\u000d\u000a        processes described above has been key to the development of scalable,\u000d\u000a        robust, optimised manufacturing processes where, although the chemical\u000d\u000a        fundamentals (rate constant, equilibrium constant, etc.) are scale\u000d\u000a        insensitive, the mass transfer components are not. The overall thinking\u000d\u000a        and methodology used is the primary scientific value (transferable to\u000d\u000a        all and any solid-liquid system, helping to direct technology\u000d\u000a        exploitation and raising the awareness of the need for such\u000d\u000a        methodology). However, the specific systems studied have proved of\u000d\u000a        particular value to Syngenta since 2008 in terms of process changes, and\u000d\u000a        have helped our process chemists from laboratory synthesis to include\u000d\u000a        more physical quantitative chemistry in the development process.\"\u000d\u000a      [10]\u000d\u000a    Impact of studies on sparingly soluble inorganic bases in polar\u000d\u000a        aprotic solvents\u000d\u000a    Research by the Compton group in this area clearly showed that key\u000d\u000a      processes, especially at full scale, can be controlled by the physical\u000d\u000a      process of inorganic base dissolution, and drew attention to the fact that\u000d\u000a      organic chemistry transformations cannot be studied in isolation from the\u000d\u000a      inorganic transformations. As such, care needs to be taken when designing,\u000d\u000a      scaling and running larger scale manufacture of the specific base used,\u000d\u000a      the physical form of the base used and the processing conditions. This had\u000d\u000a      substantial impact for Syngenta since 2008. They manufacture Amistar (the\u000d\u000a      world's largest selling fungicide) via a sequence, the final step of which\u000d\u000a      employs K2CO3 to deprotonate an acid, HA, in a\u000d\u000a      polar aprotic solvent, to produce a nucleophilic A-K+ salt.\u000a      This subsequently reacts with an electrophilic chloro-heterocycle to\u000d\u000a      produce the active ingredient (Ai). The rate limiting `step' in the\u000d\u000a      overall process can switch from being the covalent-bond-forming reaction\u000d\u000a      to the rate of carbonate dissolution, depending on the carbonate salt\u000d\u000a      being used. Understanding this has allowed Syngenta to optimise the\u000d\u000a      robustness of the process and appreciate fully the potential impact of\u000d\u000a      using alternative carbonate sources.\u000d\u000a    The production of Actara, Syngenta's world-leading insecticide, also uses\u000d\u000a      K2CO3 in the final Ai stage in an analogous manner.\u000d\u000a      For environmental reasons, Syngenta desired to switch from K2CO3\u000d\u000a      to Na2CO3, but Na2CO3 failed\u000d\u000a      in process development with much lower rates, lower conversions, longer\u000d\u000a      cycle times and increased by-products. Compton's work showed that the\u000d\u000a      solubility of Na2CO3 and rate of dissolution into\u000d\u000a      polar aprotic solvents is an order of magnitude less than K2CO3.\u000d\u000a      With this insight, Syngenta found that the solution-phase reactivity of\u000d\u000a      the A-K+ and A- Na+ salts were\u000d\u000a      comparable (slight differentiation due to ion-pairing effects) and that\u000d\u000a      the failure with Na2CO3 was due to the process being\u000d\u000a      controlled by the slow rate of dissolution. With this knowledge in hand,\u000d\u000a      alternative processes were rapidly developed.\u000d\u000a    In both of these examples, water can be produced. In some cases the\u000d\u000a      system then switches from involving solid-liquid mass transfer to\u000d\u000a      solid-liquid-liquid transfer as the water produced becomes saturated in\u000d\u000a      the inorganic base and phase separates from the polar aprotic solvent.\u000d\u000a      This produces a gelatinous mass, which at full production scale requires\u000d\u000a      control of agitation and active removal of the water. Otherwise, again,\u000d\u000a      the rate of inorganic base mass transfer from the solid phase through the\u000d\u000a      aqueous liquid phase to the continuous organic solvent (in which the\u000d\u000a      reactant resides) becomes rate limiting. The methods devised by Compton\u000d\u000a      have been used by Syngenta to study and control precisely such a process\u000d\u000a      for an important recently-developed herbicide. A conversion of &gt;98%\u000d\u000a      without rate-limiting mass transfer is now obtained in manufacture, versus\u000d\u000a      a previous figure of ~75% [10].\u000d\u000a    Impact of studies on sparingly soluble organic molecules reacting with\u000d\u000a        solubilised reactants\u000d\u000a    Triazine-based herbicides such as Atrazine (used in Syngenta's product\u000d\u000a      Gesaprim) are crucial to agriculture; it is estimated triazine-based\u000d\u000a      herbicides currently save US consumers &gt;$ 3 billion p.a. in decreased\u000d\u000a      producer costs and increased yield and support 85,000 US jobs [9].\u000d\u000a      Cyanuric chloride forms the basis of triazine-based herbicides, and within\u000d\u000a      Syngenta the science behind the research of the Compton group has\u000d\u000a      subsequently been used to optimise the process for manufacture of\u000d\u000a      herbicides like Gesaprim. Prior to the research of the Compton group, this\u000d\u000a      had suffered from scale up issues; the work helped identify that the root\u000d\u000a      cause of the problems was coating of the reactant solid with an even more\u000d\u000a      insoluble product. [10]\u000d\u000a    Targeted removal of metal ions from waste streams\u000d\u000a    Homogeneous Pd catalysis is important in major industrial coupling\u000d\u000a      reactions. The downside of large scale Pd use beyond the laboratory-scale\u000d\u000a      is the large amounts of solubilised Pd that have to be recovered and\u000d\u000a      removed from waste streams &#8212; for both cost and environmental reasons. The\u000d\u000a      methods and concepts developed by the Compton group have been used by\u000d\u000a      Syngenta since 2008 to plan how to address the issue and optimise\u000d\u000a      recovery. [10]\u000d\u000a    The cost of goods is an especially important issue in the agrochemical\u000d\u000a      industry [11]. Syngenta are unable to quantify the precise financial\u000d\u000a      benefits to them of the Compton research concerning individual steps in\u000d\u000a      multi-stage overall manufacturing processes. However, in the context of\u000d\u000a      yearly revenues of billions of dollars, the financial impact for the\u000d\u000a      company is likely to be very substantial. According to the Senior Fellow\u000d\u000a      at Syngenta UK, \"Overall the research of the Compton group has been of\u000d\u000a        great benefit to Syngenta, enabling significant improvements in the\u000d\u000a        company's development of processes, and sustainably increasing its\u000d\u000a        capability in quantitative physical chemistry. The extension of this has\u000d\u000a        been broad impact into Syngenta's production processes.\" [10]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The cost of goods is an especially important issue in developing\u000d\u000a      commercially available agrochemicals, which must be manufactured on a\u000d\u000a      large scale. Richard Compton's research at the University of Oxford has\u000d\u000a      led to a step change in the understanding of heterogeneous reaction\u000d\u000a      mechanisms for liquid &#8212; organic solid or liquid &#8212; inorganic solid\u000d\u000a      processes involved in large-scale manufacturing processes.

The work\u000d\u000a      described has been carried out since 1993 under the supervision of Richard\u000d\u000a      Compton at Oxford University. It has involved development of experimental\u000d\u000a      and modelling methodologies to interrogate and quantify chemical and\u000d\u000a      physical processes occurring directly at the solid-liquid interface rather\u000d\u000a      than inferring them from remote indirect methods. Examples of the methods\u000d\u000a      developed include the channel flow cell with numerous in situ\u000d\u000a      analysis methodologies (this has been adopted and adapted by others, but\u000d\u000a      was conceptualised and developed first by Compton), dynamic in situ\u000d\u000a      AFM [1] and numerous novel electrochemical techniques. Modelling of the\u000d\u000a      mass transfer processes between detector and solid-liquid interfaces under\u000d\u000a      controlled and defined fluid-dynamic regimes has enabled direct\u000d\u000a      measurement of the solid-liquid interfacial processes involved.\u000d\u000a      Importantly, the new methods enable classes of differentiated mechanisms\u000d\u000a      to be quantified, varying from those where reaction occurs solely in the\u000d\u000a      solution phase following dissolution, through processes occurring in the\u000d\u000a      interfacial regime, to true heterogeneous reactions that occur directly\u000d\u000a      either at or within the solid surface. The methodology has been applied to\u000d\u000a      both reactive dissolution processes and precipitation processes.

CC is sparingly\u000d\u000a      soluble in water. The Compton group has quantified the reactive\u000d\u000a      dissolution of CC with amines including competitive hydrolysis [2], which\u000d\u000a      occurs in parallel with dissolution. Similarly, a mechanistic\u000d\u000a      understanding of the reaction of the insoluble p-chloranil with\u000d\u000a      amines has been developed. In this case, the mechanism is further\u000d\u000a      complicated by formation of a product of even lower solubility which\u000d\u000a      \"coats\" the reactant, inhibiting the process [1]. The hydrolysis of\u000d\u000a      crystalline trityl chloride has also been quantified and shown to be truly\u000d\u000a      interfacial, driven by the specific orientation and concentration of C-Cl\u000d\u000a      bonds at the substrate crystal surface; this is an unambiguous example of\u000d\u000a      how Compton's methodologies can clearly characterise surface reactivity\u000d\u000a      that is dependent upon the specific crystal face exposed to the reacting\u000d\u000a      liquid medium [3]. This research was carried out in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Zeneca Ltd (who merged into Syngenta AG in 2000).\u000d\u000a    (ii) Studies on sparingly soluble inorganic bases in polar aprotic\u000d\u000a        solvents\u000d\u000a      A significant extension of Compton's work was to refocus the research from\u000d\u000a      organic to inorganic solids. Inorganic bases such as K2CO3\u000d\u000a      are used routinely with solvents such as DMF to generate the reactive\u000d\u000a      anion of an acid in solution for subsequent reaction with a solubilised\u000d\u000a      electrophile. The research conducted on K2CO3\u000d\u000a      clearly showed that very low base solubility can, and indeed does, lead to\u000d\u000a      the dissolution of the base into the solvent becoming rate limiting,\u000d\u000a      rather than any subsequent chemical step. Establishing this fact has had\u000d\u000a      significant impact on operation at full scale. Work by Compton (in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Syngenta AG) quantified the dissolution rates of\u000d\u000a      inorganic bases and how they vary depending upon conditions, between\u000d\u000a      related structures (e.g. K+ vs Na+ base), and the\u000d\u000a      crystal structure [4]. The methods developed were readily transferable to\u000d\u000a      Syngenta's processes for agrochemical production (see Section 4) and had a\u000d\u000a      major impact on their choice of base in manufacturing processes.\u000d\u000a    (iii) Targeted removal of metal ions from waste streams\u000d\u000a      Metal catalysed processes, especially using palladium, are becoming\u000d\u000a      increasingly important in industry. The detection, removal and recovery of\u000d\u000a      pollution from waste streams is important for cost reasons and to minimise\u000d\u000a      environmental impact. The Compton group developed methods using simple\u000d\u000a      functionalisation of cheap carbon to recover precious metals such as\u000d\u000a      palladium from water, including detailed characterisation of the surface\u000d\u000a      physical properties that control the removal processes [5].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18144","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Oxford University Botanic Garden is the oldest botanic garden in the\u000d\u000a      UK and a major tourist attraction in the city, with over 100,000 visitors\u000d\u000a      from all over the world every year (ranked 16th of 92 tourist\u000d\u000a      attractions in Oxford on TripAdvisor, July 2013). The research link\u000d\u000a      between the UOA and the Botanic Garden goes back more than 100 years\u000d\u000a      including the work of Sir Robert Robinson (who pioneered the isolation and\u000d\u000a      study of bioactive compounds from plants in the early 20th\u000d\u000a      Century); the Chemistry at the Garden public project has taken inspiration\u000d\u000a      from this historical link and built on it to provide a public engagement\u000d\u000a      project with contemporary relevance.\u000d\u000a    The series of collaborative outreach projects started in 2011,\u000d\u000a      International Year of Chemistry, when an enthusiastic group of staff and\u000d\u000a      research students from the Chemistry Department hosted a poster exhibition\u000d\u000a      at the Garden. The posters told stories about the chemistry of\u000d\u000a      plant-derived compounds, with titles such as \"Poisonous plants: an\u000d\u000a      unlikely source of medicine!\", \"History molecules; plants and\u000d\u000a      archaeology\", \"When life gives you lemons...take some Miraculin\", \"Natural\u000d\u000a      Solar Fuels\". The exhibition was in a prominent location near the entrance\u000d\u000a      to the Garden and there were over 14,000 visitors to the garden during the\u000d\u000a      four-month exhibition (as recorded by ticket sales) [7]. The launch event\u000d\u000a      for the exhibition was attended by the Lord Mayor of Oxford and other\u000d\u000a      local councillors, as well as senior representatives from industry,\u000d\u000a      business and the University. Comments from the Exhibition's visitors' book\u000d\u000a      included: \"Fascinating information and communicated in a simple style\u000d\u000a        for us non-chemists. Brilliant!\"; \"A very interesting exhibition\u000d\u000a        and well presented. Found lots of information on plants found in my\u000d\u000a        garden.\" [8]\u000d\u000a    From September 2012, highlights of this exhibition were developed into an\u000d\u000a      ongoing Chemistry Discovery Audio Trail, which includes Anderson, Vincent,\u000d\u000a      Parkin and McCullagh talking about aspects of their research described in\u000d\u000a      Section 2. Acting on some of the feedback from the poster exhibition, each\u000d\u000a      audio feature, delivered via an interactive map of the Garden, is\u000d\u000a      accompanied by a chemical structure model of the compound being described.\u000d\u000a      Over 400 visitors and 200 post-16 students and teachers have so far taken\u000d\u000a      the trail [9] and there have been at least 1,700 downloads of the trail\u000d\u000a      audio podcasts from iTunesU and the University of Oxford podcast page [9].\u000d\u000a      A video about the project is publicly available, featuring extracts from\u000d\u000a      the chemistry audio trail and researchers talking about how highly they\u000d\u000a      value the opportunity to engage with new audiences. The trail reaches an\u000d\u000a      audience that might otherwise not engage with research of this kind, as\u000d\u000a      evidenced by comments such as a 2012 review on TripAdvisor: \"The\u000d\u000a        Chemistry trail &#8212; an audio system that accompanies you [on your\u000d\u000a        visit] &#8212; ... gives some fascinating insights into the plants and why\u000d\u000a        they are significant.\" [10]. After a visit with his class a\u000d\u000a      secondary school teacher commented \"Very interesting chemical stories\u000d\u000a        told by real scientists. Excellent to see the molecular models next to\u000d\u000a        the plants\" [11].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    A molecular model on the audio trail\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The next development was to introduce more face-to-face contact between\u000d\u000a      academics and the general public. During May to July 2013, academics from\u000d\u000a      the Chemistry Department (Davies, Anderson, Vincent, Sartbaeva and Cooper)\u000d\u000a      delivered a series of guided walks around the Botanic Garden, using plants\u000d\u000a      to explain key aspects of their research as in Section 2. Over 50\u000d\u000a      individuals attended the talks, and the intimate setting meant visitors\u000d\u000a      were able to engage with the chemists in ways that had meaningful impact\u000d\u000a      on their perception of science. Detailed written feedback was collected\u000d\u000a      from all attendees, with one example stating \"I feel that what I have\u000d\u000a        picked up \"in small bits\" has helped me read the science sections of\u000d\u000a        public media in a more informed way.\" [12]\u000d\u000a    One of the major themes from the Chemistry at the Garden project was\u000d\u000a      selected for an interactive stand at the prestigious one-week Royal\u000d\u000a      Society Summer Science Exhibition in July 2013. The topic, \"Solving the\u000d\u000a      Energy Crisis &#8212; from Ancient to Future Solar Fuels\", linked directly to\u000d\u000a      Armstrong and Parkin's research on artificial photosynthesis (see Section\u000d\u000a      2). During the week-long exhibition over 30 volunteers from the Department\u000d\u000a      and the Botanic Garden, led by Rhiannon Evans (PDRA in the Armstrong\u000d\u000a      group), worked on the stand. Always led by a member of the solar fuels\u000d\u000a      research group, the exhibition received over 12,500 visitors, including\u000d\u000a      11,400 from the media, schools and the general public (official figures\u000d\u000a      from the RS). The Oxford Chemistry team spoke directly with at least 3,000\u000d\u000a      visitors, measured by handing out stickers to everyone who engaged with\u000d\u000a      the stand over the course of the week. The team also engaged online\u000d\u000a      through social media, podcasts, the RSSE website (which received 83,000\u000d\u000a      unique visitors over the course of the exhibition), and the blog, where\u000d\u000a      aspiring scientists posted results from a take-home chlorophyll experiment\u000d\u000a      after visiting the exhibit, continuing after July 2013 [13]. The\u000d\u000a      popularity of the stand was enhanced by a `hands-on' approach with\u000d\u000a      interactive demonstrations and experiments completed by hundreds of\u000d\u000a      people. The activities linked to several aspects of primary and secondary\u000d\u000a      school Science, Maths and Geography curricula and A-level Biology and\u000d\u000a      Chemistry curricula. The strong impact of the exhibition on school pupils\u000d\u000a      and their teachers was evidenced by requests for follow-up resource packs\u000d\u000a      which were delivered to 84 UK schools, the majority of which had never\u000d\u000a      been in contact with the Department of Chemistry before [13]. Since the\u000d\u000a      exhibition the Department has been approached directly by students asking\u000d\u000a      for further information about solar fuels science, including one Year 13\u000d\u000a      student at North London Collegiate School who wrote \"I was fascinated\u000d\u000a        by your display at the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition, and I\u000d\u000a        believe others at my school would love to hear about your work too. We\u000d\u000a        would be delighted if you would be able to talk to us about 'Ancient to\u000d\u000a        Future Solar Fuels'.\" [14].\u000d\u000a \u000d\u000aA Chemistry Department volunteer engaging with school students at the RSSE\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    The Department raised over &#163; 30,000 in sponsorship for the RSSE stand.\u000d\u000a      One of the sponsors, the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), gave support\u000d\u000a      for the Future Solar Fuels stand since the focus aligned with their own\u000d\u000a      programme of activities, in particular the goal of raising public and\u000d\u000a      political awareness of the environmental and economic potential of fuels\u000d\u000a      produced using sunlight, as well as with the strength of UK research in\u000d\u000a      this area. The RSC provided both funding and relevant materials for\u000d\u000a      distribution, taking advantage of the stall as a `channel to a wider\u000d\u000a      audience', and welcoming the fact that the UOA planned to `create a legacy\u000d\u000a      from the stand' and promote future solar fuels beyond the RSSE. The RSC\u000d\u000a      also valued the involvement of practising researchers on the stand, as\u000d\u000a      well as the collaboration with the University of York researchers [15].\u000d\u000a    Finally, this sustained series of engagement beyond academia has\u000d\u000a      established links with the outreach ambitions of industry. Since 2011,\u000d\u000a      industry sponsors have included BP, Syngenta, Johnson Matthey, Infineum,\u000d\u000a      AZ, Evotech, GSK, Basildon Chemicals and the Society of Chemical Industry\u000d\u000a      (SCI), plus the donation of equipment by Locktronics\/Matrix. Syngenta and\u000d\u000a      SCI both sponsored the event because they saw its value in informing and\u000d\u000a      enthusing the general public about the society benefits of plant chemistry\u000d\u000a      [16, 17]. BP's Chief of Staff stated: \"The summer exhibition is a\u000d\u000a        great way to engage current and future scientists and the general public\u000d\u000a        and to raise awareness of science in general.

This work\u000d\u000a      not only includes total synthesis efforts towards these antiviral\u000d\u000a      molecules, but also the development of new synthetic methodology that was\u000d\u000a      only conceived because of the chemical \/ structural relevance to these\u000d\u000a      plant-derived natural products [1].\u000d\u000a    Kylie Vincent (Lecturer) is developing new tools for understanding small\u000d\u000a      molecule activation by metallo-enzymes including dinitrogen reduction by\u000d\u000a      nitrogenase in soil and plant roots. The groups of Vincent and Armstrong\u000d\u000a      (both Oxford) and Lance Seefeldt (Utah State University) used the control\u000d\u000a      of electron transfer to nitrogenase via low-potential reductants or an\u000d\u000a      electrode to study catalysis and ligand binding [2].\u000d\u000a    Fraser Armstrong (Professor) and Alison Parkin (Research Fellow at Oxford\u000d\u000a      2008-12) have applied the chemical principles of bio-catalysis to\u000d\u000a      developing `artificial photosynthesis' systems. The three fundamental\u000d\u000a      components of such systems (light capture, electron source and fuel\u000d\u000a      production systems) are studied as separate entities in the Armstrong Labs\u000d\u000a      (e.g. enzyme-based bio-catalytic hydrogen production), with the ultimate\u000d\u000a      aim of integrating these components into a scalable system with extended\u000d\u000a      efficiencies and lifetimes. While at Oxford Dr Parkin pioneered the\u000d\u000a      electrochemical characterisation of these bio-catalytic systems which are\u000d\u000a      helping to develop an understanding of how to harness non-platinum metals\u000d\u000a      in proof-of-concept energy devices [3, 4].\u000d\u000a    James McCullagh (Head of Mass Spectrometry) has explored plants in\u000d\u000a      relation to archaeological chemistry. He has focussed on developing\u000d\u000a      strategies for compound-specific palaeodietary reconstruction using mass\u000d\u000a      spectrometry, and shown that carbon isotope ratios of amino acids from\u000d\u000a      archaeological proteins can provide useful information about an\u000d\u000a      individual's diet. In other studies his development of compound specific\u000d\u000a      radiocarbon dating has made a significant contribution to understanding of\u000d\u000a      the dispersal of anatomically modern humans into Europe [5].\u000d\u000a    Steve Davies' (Waynflete Professor of Chemistry) research since 1993 has\u000d\u000a      included the development of asymmetric synthetic methods and total\u000d\u000a      synthesis of natural products, including many derived from plants. X-ray\u000d\u000a      crystallography is a key analytical tool for this research and is used for\u000d\u000a      both characterisation of chemical structure and the determination of\u000d\u000a      absolute stereochemistry of products [6].

Taking advantage of cloud computing techniques, the\u000a      natural successor to\u000a      Screensaver Lifesaver, to increase the scale and speed of its virtual\u000a      screening methods, InhibOx\u000a      has helped to drive down costs of searching for leads in a way that has\u000a      enabled much smaller\u000a      companies to enter the field of drug development. InhibOx's key product is\u000a      the drug database\u000a      Scopius.\u000a    After spin-out in 2001, Isis Innovation Ltd. (the technology transfer arm\u000a      of the University of Oxford)\u000a      exclusively licensed the software technology developed by the Richards\u000a      group to InhibOx. From\u000a      2004 to 2008, a new round of investment enabled InhibOx to develop initial\u000a      versions of the Scopius\u000a      database and novel software methods, informed by the lessons learned\u000a      regarding the issues of\u000a      large scale database construction obtained with Screensaver; in this\u000a      period the level of commercial\u000a      activity was minimal. At the start of 2008, Scopius consisted of\u000a      approximately 3 million molecules;\u000a      by the end of the assessment period it contained &gt;112 million\u000a      molecules, making it the world's\u000a      largest high-quality database of candidate compounds, either commercially\u000a      available or\u000a      synthesisable in a few steps. InhibOx has also produced an array of more\u000a      focused databases for\u000a      specialist applications. Since 2008, InhibOx has used ElectroShape, the\u000a      ultrafast technique\u000a      invented by the Richards Group which incorporates chiral shape\u000a      recognition, to further develop the\u000a      search software. InhibOx's CEO states that \"InhibOx has developed a\u000a        comprehensive array of\u000a        computer-aided drug design technologies that helped to advance\u000a        real-world commercial drug\u000a        discovery projects. The contribution of Richards has been fundamental to\u000a        this achievement both\u000a        through the development of new science and his experience in bridging\u000a        the gap between basic and\u000a        applied research.\" [7]\u000a    Rather than developing a software product to sell, InhibOx has focussed\u000a      on running targeted\u000a      database searches for customers, producing lists of potential molecules\u000a      that they can use as drug\u000a      leads. This has had a particular impact for SMEs. In some fields of drug\u000a      discovery, it can cost\u000a      billions to bring a drug to market, including an estimated &#163; 400,000 for a\u000a      company to build its own\u000a      molecule database in order to find the right molecules to experiment with,\u000a      and typically &gt;&#163; 50M -100M\u000a\u0009  to develop compounds suitable for use in clinical trials. These high\u000a      costs have hindered the\u000a      pre-clinical trial phases of drug development, restricting them to very\u000a      large, well-financed\u000a      companies. InhibOx has enabled increased competition in early-stage drug\u000a      R&amp;D by making\u000a      compound searching more affordable for SMEs; a target search of molecules\u000a      using Scopius costs\u000a      around &#163; 20,000 - a fraction of what it would cost a small company to\u000a      build its own database.\u000a      InhibOx's client base demonstrates the way in which it has helped to open\u000a      up early-stage\u000a      development to smaller companies: 75% of its clients are SMEs, e.g.\u000a      DormaTarg, Mission\u000a      Therapeutics, Lauras and Cephalon, and 25% are corporates, e.g. Bristol\u000a      Myers Squibb and\u000a      Colgate Palmolive. This reflects and supports a shift in the way the\u000a      market operates; big pharma\u000a      will in some cases buy drug leads from small companies rather than develop\u000a      leads themselves.\u000a      Lauras' Vice President for R&amp;D commented that InhibOx has helped\u000a        redesign the company's drug\u000a        targeting programmes and suggested new lines of derivatisation that have\u000a        delivered compounds\u000a        with the properties they wanted [8]. Likewise DormaTarg worked with\u000a      InhibOx on in silico\u000a      screening, testing several of the hits predicted by InhibOx, and finding\u000a      that several showed the kind\u000a      of novel activity they were seeking [9].\u000a    In 2010 InhibOx designed a programme to develop Tumour Necrosis Factor-&#945;\u000a      Converting Enzyme\u000a      inhibitors for inflammatory disease starting from a non-selective weak\u000a      lead molecule. Using\u000a      InhibOx structure-based design technology and project management\u000a      expertise, a cost-effective\u000a      semi-virtual discovery project delivered a novel compound series and\u000a      optimised a lead candidate\u000a      requiring the synthesis of only 33 compounds within a 6-month timescale.\u000a      The series (based on\u000a      bicyclosulfonyl acid compounds) was patented by InhibOx [10], and the\u000a      programme was sold in\u000a      December 2010 to a large EU-based pharmaceutical company. This is an\u000a      example of InhibOx\u000a      providing the initial screening of compounds that are now being taken\u000a      forward in further research.\u000a    More recently InhibOx has taken advantage of the experience developed in\u000a      its pioneering use of\u000a      cloud computing for large-scale molecular modelling. The availability of\u000a      new and powerful cloud\u000a      computing services which can be leveraged on demand has enabled InhibOx to\u000a      provide large-\u000a      scale virtual screening throughput at low cost for specific purposes. In\u000a      2012, the company created\u000a      a corporate virtual library for a major corporation based on their\u000a      available chemistry. The result\u000a      contained over 28 million drug-like molecules and was completed in just\u000a      over 4 days using cloud\u000a      computing facilities from Amazon Web Services (AWS). The computational\u000a      cluster constructed\u000a      would have ranked the project in the Top 500 Supercomputers, with a speed\u000a      to 240 TFlop\/s.;\u000a      constructing this level of hardware infrastructure in-house would have\u000a      cost InhibOx around $ 200k,\u000a      so the use of AWS led to considerable cost savings. This work was\u000a      highlighted in a case study on\u000a      the AWS web site [11]. Company expertise in this area is reflected in a\u000a      recent review by InhibOx\u000a      authors analysing the applications of cloud computing to molecular\u000a      modelling [12].\u000a    InhibOx has made a conscious decision to remain focussed and concentrate\u000a      on core areas of\u000a      expertise, a strategy which has helped it to weather the upheaval in the\u000a      pharmaceutical industry\u000a      while many larger biotechs have gone out of business. It has maintained\u000a      steady business during\u000a      the impact period; income and investment since 2008 has totalled around &#163;\u000a      2.8M, including sales\u000a      revenue of &#163; 250,000 in 2012. It is an export-led company with 60% of\u000a      sales in the US, 25% in\u000a      Europe and 15% within the UK [7]. Since 2008, it has established an\u000a      additional office in Princeton,\u000a      USA and since 2010 developed commercial partnerships with the Cambridge\u000a      Crystallographic\u000a      Data Centre, Intelligensys, COSMIC Discoveries and Molport [13]. These\u000a      companies provide\u000a      complementary expertise in virtual screening, computer-aided drug\u000a      discovery and chemical\u000a      compound manufacture. The Scientific Director of Intelligensys has\u000a      outlined the benefits to them\u000a      (and to drug discovery generally) of the partnership: `We have seen,\u000a        over many years, too many\u000a        seemingly promising lead compounds fail to make it through preclinical\u000a        tests. This has been\u000a        expensive to the industry and is largely avoidable. This collaboration\u000a        is delivering the capability to\u000a        stem these losses and deliver much more cost-effective drug discovery as\u000a        a result.' [14].\u000a    InhibOx's innovation, underpinned by the Richards' Group work, has led to\u000a      it being selected as a\u000a      partner on several high-profile EU projects such as a recent FP7 framework\u000a      grant worth &#8364; 1M to\u000a      InhibOx [15], and its innovation\/international excellence was recognised\u000a      in May 2011 with InhibOx\u000a      being short listed for the prestigious Red Herring 100 Award &#8212; a mark of\u000a      distinction for identifying\u000a      promising new companies and entrepreneurs.

Improving the selection of which molecules to\u000a      work with is a key part of\u000a      improving return on investment from early stage R&amp;D spend, especially\u000a      for SME companies.\u000a      Computer-based screening is a potentially valuable tool for predicting\u000a      which molecules warrant\u000a      further investigation. Drug companies hold internal databases which may\u000a      hold tens of millions of\u000a      real or virtual molecules; however:\u000a    \u000a      they are often narrowly concentrated around that company's areas of\u000a        expertise;\u000a      it can take 2-3 weeks to search the database (depending on computer\u000a        power available) to\u000a        predict whether a molecule has potential for binding to a particular\u000a        target;\u000a      developing a database in house is a specialised task and may be too\u000a        expensive for small\u000a        organisations (typically requiring two full-time staff for 5 years, or\u000a        around &#163;400,000).\u000a    \u000a    With these limitations in mind, in 2001, a project known as Screensaver\u000a      Lifesaver led by Graham\u000a      Richards set out to build a database of millions of drug-like molecules.\u000a      The database has two\u000a      sections: CSPACE, all molecules available commercially and VSPACE, virtual\u000a      molecules but with\u000a      known synthetic route. Software developed by the Richards group used the\u000a      idle processing power\u000a      of volunteers' computers around the globe to screen molecules and assess\u000a      whether they are\u000a      candidate inhibitors of human proteins for cancer treatment. The concept\u000a      was simple: ruling out\u000a      molecules that were unlikely to be pharmaceutically beneficial meant that\u000a      resources could be\u000a      efficiently concentrated on a smaller number of more promising molecules.\u000a      Screensaver Lifesaver\u000a      was an early example of a computational chemistry project of this kind and\u000a      remains the largest\u000a      such experiment ever conducted. It was very successful, with over 3.5\u000a      million personal computers\u000a      in more than 200 countries used to screen 3.5 billion separate molecules\u000a      for their inhibitory\u000a      potential. The project produced a wealth of potential cancer drug leads\u000a      for 12 target proteins and,\u000a      importantly, revealed for the first time the viability of virtual\u000a      screening using a grid of PCs [1].\u000a      Screensaver Lifesaver led directly to the spin-out of the company InhibOx\u000a      Ltd in late 2001, based\u000a      on the Richards-group research.\u000a    Subsequent research focused on improving effectiveness in searching the\u000a      billions of virtually\u000a        accessible compounds. In particular, this focused on enabling\u000a      searches with virtual molecules\u000a      which `look like' known drug candidates (e.g. a natural drug or an\u000a      existing commercial synthetic\u000a      compound). The Richards Group made two important advances:\u000a    \u000a      Novel ultrafast computing techniques were needed to help whittle down\u000a        the millions of\u000a        molecular options more quickly. Techniques were developed to search\u000a        databases efficiently\u000a        for molecules of similar shape [2, 3]. In particular they used an\u000a        approach based on the\u000a        moments of distance distributions which improved the speed of\u000a        molecular-shape\u000a        recognition by at least 3 orders of magnitude. A prospective screening\u000a        application of the\u000a        method to identify novel inhibitors of arylamine N-acetyltransferases\u000a        had a 40% hit rate (ie.\u000a        active above a critical limit) and was amongst the most cited articles\u000a        in the Journal of the\u000a        Royal Society Interface in 2010 [4]. In order to be useful as an\u000a        antagonist or agonist of a\u000a        target, a small molecule must bind to a specific site on the target. The\u000a        method for\u000a        identification of this site was the subject of a patent granted to\u000a        Richards in 2007 [5].\u000a      Virtual screening requires the search procedure to group molecules\u000a        with strong\u000a        resemblances in terms of electrostatics and lipophilicity as well as\u000a        shape. In 2010 - 2011\u000a        the Richards Group developed and published innovative solutions to this\u000a        problem [6]. At the\u000a        time, the most widely-used methods for this type of virtual screening\u000a        involved a molecular\u000a        alignment step that was computationally intensive and thus provided a\u000a        constraint on the\u000a        size of database that could be searched. The new methods developed an\u000a        alignment-free\u000a        approach that was orders of magnitude faster, while maintaining\u000a        accuracy. By introducing\u000a        partial charge information as a 4th dimension the\u000a        electrostatics was handled very efficiently.\u000a    \u000a    These key advances, together with additional developments at InhibOx\u000a      allowing chirality to be\u000a      incorporated into molecular similarity searching (i.e. distinguishing\u000a      enantiomers), made it possible\u000a      to perform extremely fast searches of a database of billions of compounds\u000a      for molecular similarity\u000a      incorporating shape, chirality, electrostatics and lipophilicity, all\u000a      critical components when\u000a      determining potential drug molecules.\u000a    Richards was a member of the academic staff at Oxford University until\u000a      his retirement in Dec 2007;\u000a      the research was continued in the UOA by two University-employed\u000a      post-doctoral researchers,\u000a      Ballester and Moretti, in collaboration with Richards (at InhibOx since\u000a      2008).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18586","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Sullivan's research [1-6] led to a range of patented products [7, 8] that\u000a      were brought to market by the spin-out company PhosphonicS [a].

Current applications of Sullivan's\u000a      technology by PhosphonicS clients include precious metal recovery in the\u000a      mining, pharmaceutical and petrochemical markets.\u000a    The initial phase of translation of Sullivan's research into commercially\u000a      viable products began in 2003 with the formation of PhosphonicS Ltd\u000a      (Founders Sullivan and Wilson) supported by Dr Malcolm Sims then Director\u000a      of Queen Mary Innovation and Enterprise (now Queen Mary Innovation Ltd).\u000a      The first staff and lab space were paid for using funds from a DTI Smart\u000a      Award and the Combined London Colleges University Challenge Seed Fund.\u000a    PhosphonicS' development progressed through a series of stages focused on\u000a      product development in the chemistry laboratories at Queen Mary during\u000a      2003-2006 and continued, following Series A funding totalling &#163;1.5\u000a      million, with a move to premises at Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxford.\u000a      Sullivan maintained her academic position at Queen Mary while acting in an\u000a      advisory capacity to the company.\u000a    The company continued to grow with the benefit of long-term investor\u000a      support from the original investor-shareholders who provided additional\u000a      amounts of &#163;1.3M in 2008 and &#163;450k in 2009.\u000a    PhosphonicS is a cleantech company that provides novel technology to\u000a      recover precious metals from process, waste and effluent streams and\u000a      providing both financial and environmental benefits to industrial end\u000a      users and metal refiners. The innovative chemistry underpinning\u000a      PhosphonicS materials [1-6] gives them leading performance for the\u000a      recovery of precious metals such as platinum and rhodium from large volume\u000a      low concentration (parts per million) waste streams, making recovery both\u000a      cleaner and more economic than alternative options. PhosphonicS' materials\u000a      are also applied in the metric-tonne volumes as next-generation metal and\u000a      organic scavengers in the pharmaceutical, and fine and speciality chemical\u000a      industries for product purification purposes.\u000a    `Case study' examples of the application of PhosphonicS materials are\u000a      available from the company website [b, c] and include the recovery of\u000a      rhodium from a waste stream that was previously being transported and\u000a      burned with no precious metal recovery. PhosphonicS provided the plant\u000a      with innovative materials that remove 95% of the rhodium from the waste\u000a      stream, of which 97% can then be reclaimed from the scavenger. Another\u000a      PhosphonicS client utilises the materials in the manufacture of active\u000a      pharmaceutical ingredients. The client uses platinum as a catalyst, which\u000a      must be removed from the product before use, with final concentrations no\u000a      greater than 10 ppm. The PhosphonicS scavenger removes 98% of the\u000a      platinum, 98% of which can be recovered.\u000a    In 2010 the company secured second round financing of &#163;3.5m (US$5.75m),\u000a      led by French venture capital company Seventure Partners (Press Release\u000a      April 2010). The new capital allowed the company to expand its core team\u000a      into larger premises, increase the number of international agents and\u000a      secure further manufacturing options for its products.\u000a    In 2011 PhosphonicS also forged a strategic liaison with multinational\u000a      company W.C. Heraeus [d], who offer batch refinery. W.C. Heraeus is\u000a      offering PhosphonicS' scavenger processes to its customers with low-grade\u000a      waste streams to enable them to capture and recycle more of their precious\u000a      metal waste.\u000a    Building on the success of Sullivan's novel technology, the number of\u000a      PhosphonicS employees had grown from six in 2005 to 25 in March 2012; the\u000a      majority at PhD level. The company has also been able to support PhD CASE\u000a      students at Queen Mary University of London. According to publically\u000a      available accounts, the average net worth (net asset value) of PhosphonicS\u000a      over the last three years (averaging end of year returns for 2010 - 2012)\u000a      was &#163;1.3m [g].\u000a    In February 2013 Seventure Partners invested a further &#163;2.1 million into\u000a      PhosphonicS. To date, the company has raised approximately &#163;9 million of\u000a      private equity investment over 10 years of trading. The investment is\u000a      facilitating ongoing acceleration of the launch of the precious metal\u000a      scavenger product range in numerous international markets, especially\u000a      mining and petrochemical, and to invest in co-developing some major\u000a      catalyst applications with industry clients.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The technology in this impact study is based on organofunctionalised\u000a      silica materials that can address market needs for high purity in\u000a      compounds that underpin many areas of the pharma, electronic and medical\u000a      sectors as well as the recovery of limited resources such as precious\u000a      metals that are used in diverse industries.

While working on organically modified silicas and\u000a      silica type materials (during the period 1995-2003) it became apparent to\u000a      Sullivan (Professor of Inorganic Chemistry at QM) and research associate\u000a      Dr John Wilson (PDRA and Academic Visitor at QM 2001-2005) that the\u000a      development of these materials for a range of potential applications was\u000a      severely hampered both in terms of cost and performance by the limited\u000a      methods then used for surface modifier synthesis. Modifiers were largely\u000a      derived from a single chloroalkylsilane source. This meant that the\u000a      resulting compounds had a very limited range of functionality.\u000a    Prof. Sullivan and Dr Wilson realised that a novel approach, based on\u000a      radical addition chemistry, would lead to products with better\u000a      performance, lower costs at scale, and which could be applied to a wider\u000a      range of problems.

A series of papers demonstrating some of the catalytic\u000a      applications of the materials including different types of oxidation,\u000a      carbon-carbon coupling and hydrogenation chemistries were published by the\u000a      team between 1998 and 2011 [1-6]. These novel organic modifiers and the\u000a      derived materials formed the inventive steps of a series of patent\u000a      applications submitted between 2001 and 2006 [7, 8].\u000a    An initial patent application on phosphonate modified silicas was\u000a      submitted by Sullivan and Wilson from Queen Mary in 2001 proceeding to\u000a      grant in the US and Europe in 2006. Patents covering the other families of\u000a      modified materials followed, including those with sulfur rich or nitrogen\u000a      rich surface modifiers. The portfolio provided materials with excellent\u000a      metal binding affinities covering the hard or soft metals in common use in\u000a      the pharmaceutical, petrochemical, mining and fine chemicals sectors and\u000a      supporting applications in areas of solid phase catalysis and purification\u000a      and embracing ideas of sustainable chemical processing.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18587","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The American Dental Association estimates that there are around 300\u000d\u000a      million periodontal examinations undertaken in the USA every year,\u000d\u000a      representing ca. 30% of the examinations undertaken world-wide.

This is an important step on the road to delivery of this\u000d\u000a      diagnostic technology to market. The clinical trials are being undertaken\u000d\u000a      by staff within the School of Clinical Dentistry at the University of\u000d\u000a      Sheffield, in partnership with Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation\u000d\u000a      Trust. The aim of the trial is to assess whether the device can be used to\u000d\u000a      detect active periodontal disease.\u000d\u000a    The initial 12-month stage of the trial necessitated the appointment of a\u000d\u000a      dental hygienist to collect patient samples. The patients were recruited\u000d\u000a      from a number of sources within the partnering hospital, including the\u000d\u000a      undergraduate periodontology teaching clinic, staff hygienist clinics and\u000d\u000a      consultant clinics.

The company, funded by Barts Charity, are currently modifying\u000d\u000a      the electrodes to increase reliability. All patient samples from the first\u000d\u000a      stage of the trial have been retained for re-testing once these\u000d\u000a      refinements are in place.\u000d\u000a    Application of Degrasense technology in other clinical settings\u000d\u000a    Krause and Watkinson's technology has already attracted significant\u000d\u000a      interest and investment from multiple industrial partners and its use in a\u000d\u000a      clinical setting has been demonstrated through application in a clinical\u000d\u000a      trial. In addition to increasing the efficacy of diagnostic tools for\u000d\u000a      assessing periodontal disease, the technology has significant potential in\u000d\u000a      a number of other clinical applications where elevated levels of\u000d\u000a      proteolytic enzymes are linked to disease states. Investigations into\u000d\u000a      these applications are ongoing (and are sensitive at this stage) but\u000d\u000a      include: (i) home monitoring of haemophilia; (ii) clinical monitoring of\u000d\u000a      sepsis and trauma; (iii) home monitoring of multiple sclerosis and (iv)\u000d\u000a      the monitoring of arterial ageing and the role of proteinases in\u000d\u000a      hypertension. All of these areas are associated with very significant\u000d\u000a      patient numbers and cost to the NHS.

They have established the\u000d\u000a      spin-out company Degrasense, which owns the underpinning intellectual\u000d\u000a      property and are developing the technology via clinical trials.\u000d\u000a    Other notable QMUL researchers working with Watkinson and Krause include\u000d\u000a      Dr Jacqueline Stair (BBSRC-funded PDRA, 2008-2009), Dr Xingewi Zheng\u000d\u000a      (IP2IPO Ltd-funded PDRA, 2008-2010) and Dr Joseph Cook (Technology\u000d\u000a      Strategy Board-funded PDRA, 2008-2009).\u000d\u000a    Research underpinning the new technology\u000d\u000a    The technology is based on the preparation of hydrogel polymers that are\u000d\u000a      cross-linked with short peptide sequences containing amino acid sequences\u000d\u000a      cleaved by the specific proteolytic enzymes being targeted [references\u000d\u000a      1-4].\u000d\u000a    Through BBSRC-funded research, Krause, Watkinson and Stair developed new\u000d\u000a      peptide cross- linked dextran hydrogels, which, they demonstrated using a\u000d\u000a      quartz crystal micro-balance, can sense protease cleavage [see publication\u000d\u000a      1]. The underpinning work involved the preparation of suitably\u000d\u000a      functionalised peptides, which could be used to cross-link dextran to form\u000d\u000a      degradable hydrogel polymers. The key synthetic challenges were to\u000d\u000a      identify both the functional group which could be cross-linked and the\u000d\u000a      nature of the polymeric matrix which would allow degradation by the\u000d\u000a      individual protease in question, at clinically relevant concentrations and\u000d\u000a      within a short time-frame, without non-specific protein binding. Several\u000d\u000a      approaches were investigated including the in situ radical\u000d\u000a      polymerisation of peptides and the cross-linking of highly functionalised\u000d\u000a      dendronised polymers. Ultimately it was found that a partially oxidised\u000d\u000a      dextran in combination with amine-functionalised peptides provided\u000d\u000a      suitable substrates which met the technical specification required.\u000d\u000a      Consequently they were able to coat individual electrodes with different\u000d\u000a      polymers so that each electrode is able to detect a specific enzyme. This\u000d\u000a      aspect of the research is central to the technology &#8212; without it no point\u000d\u000a      of care device could have been produced.\u000d\u000a    In a second publication [2], Watkinson, Krause, Zheng and Cook\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the efficacy of this technology in the selective detection of\u000d\u000a      a number of proteases (Human Neutrophil Elastase, Cathepsin-G, and MMP8)\u000d\u000a      that are clinically relevant to periodontal disease. Periodontal disease\u000d\u000a      (periodontitis) is an inflammatory disease that affects the periodontum,\u000d\u000a      the tissues that surround and support the teeth. If left untreated,\u000d\u000a      chronic periodontitis leads to degradation of bone and ultimately to the\u000d\u000a      loss of teeth. However, progression of the disease is not uniform across\u000d\u000a      infected sites and accurate clinical methods for distinguishing areas\u000d\u000a      where the disease is active, rather than inert, are currently lacking. As\u000d\u000a      a result much unnecessary treatment of periodontal sites that are\u000d\u000a      quiescent occurs. This is both costly and potentially causes additional\u000d\u000a      damage to teeth attachments.\u000d\u000a    The research, led by Krause and Watkinson [1, 2], clearly established the\u000d\u000a      potential for a new technology, as a point-of-care clinical diagnostic\u000d\u000a      tool of protease activity associated with periodontal disease. The\u000d\u000a      intellectual property underpinning the technology was protected by a\u000d\u000a      European patent [3] and a further patent application has been filed [4].\u000d\u000a    The potential of this technology led to follow-on funding secured from\u000d\u000a      the BBSRC and the Heptagon fund in 2006. Then with support from the\u000d\u000a      Technology Strategy Board, and in collaboration with a number of key\u000d\u000a      industrial partners, Watkinson and Krause were able to develop the\u000d\u000a      technology to the point where it could be tested in a clinical trial.

This led to increasing collaborative and consultancy involvement with\u000d\u000aIndustry in the 1990s, where high throughput screening was the prevalent method for discovering\u000d\u000anew hits for drug development. Abell was frustrated by the randomness of this approach, and this\u000d\u000afuelled his interest in structure-based approaches to enzyme inhibition. This was facilitated by a\u000d\u000amajor, BBSRC funded collaboration with Professor Tom Blundell on the mechanism, inhibition and\u000d\u000astructure of enzymes involved in pantothenate biosynthesis.1,2,3\u000d\u000aIn 1998, Blundell and Abell, together with Dr H Jhoti (at the time working at GSK), suggested a\u000d\u000anovel approach to drug discovery, which underpinned the formation in May 1999 of the spinout\u000d\u000acompany Astex Technology Ltd. The approach was to develop novel therapeutics from very small\u000d\u000achemical fragments (MW&lt;300) using high-throughput methods with powerful X-ray sources,\u000d\u000atogether with roboticised data collection, to define at high-resolution complexes of small molecules\u000d\u000a(fragments). They hypothesised that a library of 300-1000 small fragments could explore chemical\u000d\u000aspace more efficiently than a million-compound library of larger drug-like molecules. The approach,\u000d\u000aknown as fragment-based drug discovery, depended on identifying the positions of fragments\u000d\u000abound to the protein by X-ray crystallography and then using knowledge of their positions and the\u000d\u000astructure of the targets to iteratively elaborate these into potent inhibitors.\u000d\u000aResearch in the laboratories of Abell and Blundell was funded in the University during 1999-2000\u000d\u000aby a research grant from Astex Technology. The research was carried out by a post-doctoral\u000d\u000aresearcher in the Department of Chemistry (Dr Martyn Frederickson) in collaboration with two post-doctoral researchers in the Department of Biochemistry (Dr Emil Parasini and Dr Anne Cleasby).\u000d\u000aMultiple crystals of target proteins were screened with a small fragment library in 1999. They\u000d\u000ademonstrated in 1999-2000 that binding of very small molecules (MW&lt;300) could be detected, and\u000d\u000atheir positions, including orientation, could be defined at high resolution by X-ray crystallography. In\u000d\u000atwo papers, Abell, Blundell and Jhoti describe the concept of X-ray structure-based fragment\u000d\u000ascreening, and the linking and \"growing\" of fragments across the binding site using X-ray structures\u000d\u000aas guides.4,5 The significance of their results enabled Abell, Blundell, and Jhoti to raise substantial\u000d\u000afurther funding and develop the spinout company Astex Technology Ltd. Due to commercial\u000d\u000asensitivity, from 2001 further research and development was carried out at Astex Technology Ltd,\u000d\u000aand the early results were not published until 2002.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"20084","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Microsoft Research has supported, built, and collaborated on a large\u000d\u000a      number of Office extensions in a number of scientific domains, but the\u000d\u000a      Chemistry Add-in for Word remains the most highly downloaded project\u000d\u000a      developed to date, that number exceeding 400,000 as of July 2012.

Together with\u000d\u000a      Henry Rzepa (Imperial College London, since 1995) they established the\u000d\u000a      first fully operational system for managing complex chemical content\u000d\u000a      entirely in Extensible Markup Language (XML), which defines a set of rules\u000d\u000a      for encoding documents in a format\u000d\u000a      that is both human- and machine-readable.\u000d\u000a      Chemical Markup Language (CML), which adapts XML to chemistry, is the\u000d\u000a      first and the most ambitious application of semantic computing in\u000d\u000a      chemistry. CML is the pioneering XML-based language for chemistry,\u000d\u000a      providing a uniform, extensible system for representing, storing, and\u000d\u000a      transmitting chemical information. CML supports 4 main methods of creating\u000d\u000a      semantic chemistry: 1) human authoring (as in conventional articles,\u000d\u000a      reports, laboratory notebooks, etc.), 2) conversion of chemical data from\u000d\u000a      legacy formats, 3) creation of semantic chemistry through computer program\u000d\u000a      output and 4) machine extraction of chemistry from unstructured and\u000d\u000a      semi-structured material (e.g. electronic chemistry publications). CML\u000d\u000a      also enables a range of concepts to be modelled, including molecules,\u000d\u000a      reactions, and chemical metadata. CML has become an important component of\u000d\u000a      many chemical information systems, including toolkits, structure editors,\u000d\u000a      and other software.1,2&amp;3\u000d\u000a    Based on the CML framework and Murray-Rust's vision of creating a simple\u000d\u000a      way for chemists worldwide to insert \"semantically intelligent\" chemical\u000d\u000a      information into documents using existing desktop applications such as\u000d\u000a      Microsoft Office Word, the Chemistry Add-In for Word (Chem4Word) Project\u000d\u000a      was initiated in 2008 in a collaboration between the Department of\u000d\u000a      Chemistry and Microsoft Research. The new Microsoft Office Word format\u000d\u000a      (.DOCX) would allow for chemical entities to be authored, manipulated, and\u000d\u000a      stored as CML files within a DOCX package in a user-friendly manner, and\u000d\u000a      the resulting files could easily be queried and mined for chemical data\u000d\u000a      whether that was expressed in the document as a name, formula, image, or\u000d\u000a      bold number reference.\u000d\u000a    Other chemical drawing tools are available, such as ChemDraw, which is\u000d\u000a      used by many chemists to create publication-ready, scientifically\u000d\u000a      meaningful drawings. A limitation of software like ChemDraw is that\u000d\u000a      individuals, groups and organisations now have a large number of Word\u000d\u000a      Documents containing embedded ChemDraw objects that cannot easily be\u000d\u000a      searched in a chemically meaningful way. Additionally, only humans can\u000d\u000a      create and interpret the chemical structures created by ChemDraw. Other\u000d\u000a      limitations of some of the currently available software include\u000d\u000a      limitations on the types of chemical structures that can be created, e.g.\u000d\u000a      some are limited to only generating organic molecules. The Chem4Word\u000d\u000a      project set out to simplify the process of inserting and modifying\u000d\u000a      chemical information from within Microsoft Office Word, and also to have\u000d\u000a      the chemical information stored and manipulated in a semantically rich\u000d\u000a      manner. Working closely with Microsoft engineers, Murray-Rust and\u000d\u000a      colleagues provided the underlying research for the design, semantic\u000d\u000a      descriptions and ontology, software algorithms, and chemical knowledge for\u000d\u000a      the program. Microsoft funded a postdoctoral scientist, Dr. Joe Townsend,\u000d\u000a      to design and implement the software.\u000d\u000a    Murray-Rust and his group, together with Microsoft Research and the\u000d\u000a      Microsoft Office Word team, jointly defined and developed the features\u000d\u000a      that led to beta (March 2010) and version 1.0 (February 2011) releases of\u000d\u000a      the Chemistry Add-in for Microsoft Office Word. This Add-in makes it\u000d\u000a      possible not only to author chemical content in Word, but also to include\u000d\u000a      the meta-data behind the structures, which means that the chemical\u000d\u000a      information can be represented in a variety of ways: 2D chemical\u000d\u000a      structures, names, chemical formulae and importantly, a variety of\u000d\u000a      semantically encoded data. In other words, instead of a static picture one\u000d\u000a      can search and select with a few clicks what information should appear in\u000d\u000a      the embedded fields.4\u000d\u000a    Chemical Mark-Up Language\u000d\u000a      In addition to Chem4Word, the following projects (in whole or part\u000d\u000a      involving the Department of Chemistry Unilever Centre for Molecular\u000d\u000a      Informatics) have included development of CML specifications, software or\u000d\u000a      applications: Molecular Standards for the Grid (DTI\/EPSRC) 2002-2005,\u000d\u000a      eMinerals (NERC), Materials Grid (DTI\/Unilever\/Accelrys), Sciborg (EPSRC),\u000d\u000a      eCrystals, (JISC\/Soton), SPECTRa (JISC), SPECTRa-T (JISC), Crystal editor\u000d\u000a      (IUCr), Crystal repository (Dept of Chemistry), Polymer Informatics\u000d\u000a      (Unilever), MDL2CML (MDL), Openbabel (Merck).5\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20087","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The LAG method developed by the Jones Group is routinely used by industry\u000d\u000a      to search for new solid forms; in particular with regard to poorly soluble\u000d\u000a      drugs, which will have limited bioavailability. The approach allows a\u000d\u000a      complete search of the phase diagram associated with the formation of new\u000d\u000a      solid forms. In addition, intellectual property can exist for each new\u000d\u000a      solid form entity.

The discovery of LAG as an effective screening method was made\u000d\u000a      in 2001 and published in the Royal Society of Chemistry journal Chemical\u000d\u000a      Communications in 2002.1 This work demonstrated how the\u000d\u000a      kinetics of the solid-solid reaction could be accelerated. Prior to this\u000d\u000a      work solution crystallisation was the main method of doing solid form\u000d\u000a      screening.\u000d\u000a    The discovery resulted from work in the Jones Group on understanding how\u000d\u000a      organic molecules pack and interact in the solid state. To expand in a\u000d\u000a      systematic way the number and types of interactions that were possible\u000d\u000a      between molecules within an organic crystal structure, from 1995 onwards\u000d\u000a      the Jones Group investigated methods for preparing crystalline solids with\u000d\u000a      two or more distinct molecular entities within them.2 This\u000d\u000a      meant, for example, that to understand how an acid function interacted\u000d\u000a      with an amine function in a crystal lattice, it was not necessary to have\u000d\u000a      both functionalities present on the same molecule. To obtain such\u000d\u000a      multicomponent solids is difficult if the solubility of the two molecules\u000d\u000a      which are being co-crystallised is very different &#8212; they will simply\u000d\u000a      crystallise as separate pure phases.\u000d\u000a    Solid-state grinding had been explored previously by others for producing\u000d\u000a      co-crystals, but in 2001 the Jones Group embarked on a series of studies\u000d\u000a      to see whether a small amount of liquid added to the solids during mixing\u000d\u000a      could have an effect on the outcome. It was discovered in 2001 that not\u000d\u000a      only did small amounts of liquid speed up the solid-solid reaction but in\u000d\u000a      numerous cases it allowed the formation of new solid forms that could not\u000d\u000a      otherwise be made. The method has now been termed \"liquid assisted\u000d\u000a      grinding\". The group disclosed this discovery in 2002 where the enhanced\u000d\u000a      kinetics was noted.1 Between 2002 and 2005 the Jones Group\u000d\u000a      discovered that the exact outcome of the solid state grinding could be\u000d\u000a      controlled by careful choice of the added liquid.3Between\u000d\u000a      2005 and 2007 it was further demonstrated that this LAG approach is\u000d\u000a      significantly more effective in searching for alternate solid forms of\u000d\u000a      drug candidates than other previously used methods, e.g. conventional\u000d\u000a      solution crystallisation or melt growth.4&amp;5 LAG is a method\u000d\u000a      that requires very small amounts of material, essential for preformulation\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical development, is rapid, and environmentally friendly because\u000d\u000a      it eliminates the need to use large amounts of solvents.\u000d\u000a    A recent independent study comparing the effectiveness of the various\u000d\u000a      approaches to screening for new forms of the drug piroxicam is given by\u000d\u000a      Fucke, et al (2012).6 The authors conclude that: \"Solvent-drop\u000a        grinding showed the highest absolute number of experiments resulting in\u000d\u000a        co-crystals\" and \"\"For an initial screening solvent drop grinding\u000d\u000a        should be preferred, as this method produced reliably co-crystal forms.\"\u000d\u000a    In the pharmaceutical industry many drug candidates in their pure form\u000d\u000a      suffer from very poor physical and chemical attributes. An example is the\u000d\u000a      increasingly common problem of poor solubility and bioavailability. To\u000d\u000a      improve solubility the pharmaceutical industry routinely searches for\u000d\u000a      alternative solid forms of the drug, e.g. formation of salt and\/or\u000d\u000a      co-crystal forms. The prior established practice of screening by\u000d\u000a      conventional crystallisation from solution is particularly difficult\u000d\u000a      because drug and coformer will tend to crystallise separately.\u000d\u000a    The LAG research was supported by Pfizer grants.

The research\u000d\u000a      programme started by Ley in the mid 1990s sought to provide a sea change\u000d\u000a      in the way molecules\u000d\u000a      could be assembled in a multi-step fashion.1 Key to the success\u000d\u000a      of the approach was the use of an\u000d\u000a      ensemble of immobilised reagents and scavengers to synthesise molecules\u000d\u000a      without the\u000d\u000a      requirement for extensive downstream processing techniques, which are\u000d\u000a      wasteful in terms of\u000d\u000a      materials, energy, time and labour costs. Moving from conventional\u000d\u000a      batch-mode chemical\u000d\u000a      production to continuous flow-based processing has had worldwide impact,\u000d\u000a      with companies across\u000d\u000a      the chemical space &#8212; from research operations to full-scale production &#8212;\u000d\u000a      now realising the benefits\u000d\u000a      and implementing continuous flow processing techniques within their\u000d\u000a      facilities.

Many new UK start-up companies, such as Vapourtec\u000d\u000a      (2003, Suffolk,\u000d\u000a      UK), Uniqsis (2007, Cambridge, UK), Cyclofluidic (2008, Welwyn Garden\u000d\u000a      City, UK), Microsaic\u000d\u000a      (2004, Woking, UK), and HEL (1987, Borehamwood, UK) were set up to exploit\u000d\u000a      the potential of\u000d\u000a      flow chemistry. These companies continue to trade and the UK is now\u000d\u000a      leading the world in\u000d\u000a      developing new, innovative equipment for flow chemistry. Ley has had\u000d\u000a      direct input into Cyclofluidic\u000d\u000a      as a member of its Scientific Advisory Board.\u000d\u000a    In 2005, Steven Ley set up the spin-out company Reaxa to exploit work on\u000d\u000a      the nickel, palladium,\u000d\u000a      platinum and osmium encapsulated reagents EnCat, and QuadraPure reaction\u000d\u000a      clean-up\u000d\u000a      scavengers. These provide a unique solution to minimise waste during\u000d\u000a      chemical reactions, and\u000d\u000a      allow precious spent catalysts to be easily recovered, facilitating\u000d\u000a      recycling and being ideal for flow\u000d\u000a      chemistry applications. The scavengers are now sold by Johnson Matthey\u000d\u000a      after it acquired the\u000d\u000a      patent in 2011, and Reaxa itself was acquired by Indian company S. Amit\u000d\u000a      Speciality Chemicals Pvt\u000d\u000a      Ltd, also in 2011, which has continued to support and promote these\u000d\u000a      important reagents, now sold\u000d\u000a      through Sigma-Aldrich.\u000d\u000a    Adoption and Application of Technology in the Commercial Sector\u000d\u000a    There are numerous examples of the use of these reagents in the\u000d\u000a      commercial sector. Two\u000d\u000a      examples published in 2012 are Pfizer's use of palladium EnCat to effect a\u000d\u000a      Suzuki cross-coupling\u000d\u000a      reaction in the synthesis of potent inhibitors of LpxC that have potential\u000d\u000a      as antibiotics2, and the use\u000d\u000a      of the same EnCat in the synthesis of a range of orally available CHK1\u000d\u000a      inhibitors by a team at the\u000d\u000a      Institute of Cancer Research.3\u000d\u000a    The QuadraPure scavengers have also been employed in industrial\u000d\u000a      processes. Novartis, for\u000d\u000a      example, published work on the clean-up of Heck reactions in 2008, which\u000d\u000a      concluded that\u000d\u000a      QuadraPure TU was the most effective adsorbent.4 Another\u000d\u000a      example is Pfizer's use of QuadraPure\u000d\u000a      TU to remove traces of palladium in the process scale-up of\u000d\u000a      [beta]2-adrenoceptor agonist PF-00610335.5\u000d\u000a    New Products Created and Commercialised\u000d\u000a    Further evidence of the impact of Ley's work on polymer supported\u000d\u000a      reagents and scavengers\u000d\u000a      under flow chemistry conditions is that a local company, Cambridge Reactor\u000d\u000a      Design have\u000d\u000a      commercialised two products which had their genesis in his laboratories.\u000d\u000a      These are the\u000d\u000a      \"Gastropod\" for conducting mixed gas\/liquid flow reactions with in-line\u000d\u000a      supported catalysts and\u000d\u000a      \"Polar Bear\" for achieving low temperatures (-89&#186;C) without cryogens for\u000d\u000a      flow mode multi-step\u000d\u000a      synthesis.

Using recyclable polymer supported\u000d\u000a      reagents in combination with\u000d\u000a      flow chemistry methods, he was able to conduct multi-step synthesis\u000d\u000a      sequences leading to the\u000d\u000a      synthesis of complex biologically active compounds. This was achieved\u000d\u000a      without recourse to\u000d\u000a      techniques such as chromatography, crystallisation, distillation or\u000d\u000a      reaction quenching, common to\u000d\u000a      more conventional synthesis methods at the time. The first paper\u000d\u000a      describing some of these\u000d\u000a      methods appeared in 19971 and within one year he had shown that\u000d\u000a      the concept could be extended\u000d\u000a      to up to six linear steps (a world record at the time) without recourse to\u000d\u000a      conventional and wasteful\u000d\u000a      downstream processing.2 This work attracted modest research\u000d\u000a      funding from the EPSRC through a\u000d\u000a      ROPA grant (GR\/M50614\/01) and a more substantial follow-up grant\u000d\u000a      (GR\/N02030\/01). The\u000d\u000a      concept for this work and its potential application for multi-step\u000d\u000a      synthesis using polymer supported\u000d\u000a      reagents with flow chemistry was the subject of a patent from his first\u000d\u000a      spin-out company in 1999.3\u000d\u000a    The grants awarded to Ley's group facilitated very rapid development of\u000d\u000a      the techniques and\u000d\u000a      resulted in a highly cited review.4 The methods were promptly\u000d\u000a      adopted by the academic community\u000d\u000a      (as evidenced by ISI listing 700 citations in 2011 alone) and by industry\u000d\u000a      with Ley's own company\u000d\u000a      leading the charge (see above). His spectacular synthesis of epothilone C,\u000d\u000a      a potent anti-tumour\u000d\u000a      agent, in just 15 linear steps using only polymer supported reagents, was\u000d\u000a      a true demonstration of\u000d\u000a      the technology and a landmark publication because it changed many people's\u000d\u000a      attitudes towards\u000d\u000a      organic synthesis using cleaner and more efficient methods.5\u000d\u000a    More significantly Ley then went on to show even further advances were\u000d\u000a      possible by using these\u000d\u000a      polymer supported reagents and related scavenger materials. This was\u000d\u000a      achieved by constructing\u000d\u000a      packed cartridges containing these species and, by appropriate machinery,\u000d\u000a      passing substrates\u000d\u000a      through these tubes in a flow chemistry manner; multi-step flow synthesis\u000d\u000a      was made possible.6 By\u000d\u000a      2006 he developed flow chemistry and immobilised reagents to deliver\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical agents and\u000d\u000a      complex natural products such as oxomaritidine in just seven steps using\u000d\u000a      this machine-assisted\u000d\u000a      approach.7 This seminal paper opened up a whole new set of\u000d\u000a      opportunities for molecular assembly\u000d\u000a      as a result of Ley's work. It also generated substantial interest at the\u000d\u000a      EPSRC, who began to fund\u000d\u000a      initiatives in the area and a large EPSRC grant in 2003 (GR\/S40343\/01), to\u000d\u000a      support further\u000d\u000a      research in Ley's group.\u000d\u000a    As these techniques were being developed and adopted worldwide, further\u000d\u000a      underpinning research\u000d\u000a      in Cambridge from Ley's group led to the discovery of a new range of\u000d\u000a      encapsulated reagents and\u000d\u000a      greatly improved polymer supported scavengers, some of which were\u000d\u000a      patented.8&amp;9 Further\u000d\u000a      research support for this area has been recently awarded to Ley's group\u000d\u000a      from the EPSRC\u000d\u000a      (EP\/K009494\/1). These immobilised systems were very effective in batch and\u000d\u000a      flow conditions and\u000d\u000a      this discovery led to the formation of a second spin-out company, Reaxa,\u000d\u000a      based in Manchester in\u000d\u000a      2005. The products are now marketed and sold worldwide for green chemistry\u000d\u000a      applications.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21352","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Newcastle University spin-out company NewChem Technologies, which was\u000a      founded in 2002, is primarily a drug development company working in\u000a      association with industrial partners. The company is the route by which\u000a      the academic research of Golding and his group is commercialised. In 2008,\u000a      as the result of steady growth, NewChem invested in new laboratories\u000a      within the School of Chemistry which are adjacent to Golding's research\u000a      group, thus enabling continuous and fruitful exchange of information and\u000a      expertise. In the period 2008-2013, NewChem has provided employment for\u000a      high quality chemists (&gt;60 FTE) and has achieved annual sales of\u000a      greater than &#163;1 million, thus making a significant contribution to\u000a      employment in the North East region [E1].\u000a    The impacts of Newcastle University research through the vehicle of\u000a      NewChem include contributions to the science of the drug anagrelide\u000a      (Xagrid), a core product of Shire, as well as development of prodrugs of\u000a      several therapeutic agents [e.g. galanthamine (Alzheimer's disease) ,\u000a      guanfacine (ADHD), meptazinol and oxycodone (pain) [E2, E3].\u000a      NewChem developed several customised release mechanisms for prodrugs that\u000a      aimed to resolve disadvantageous drug properties, e.g. poor intestinal\u000a      absorption, poor bioavailability due to extensive 1st pass\u000a      metabolism, high abuse potential, local GI toxicity, colonic delivery etc.\u000a      According to the Former Head of New Product Discovery (Small molecules) at\u000a      Shire: \"The positive impact of that relationship [NewChem and\u000a      Shire] on the research output of Shire cannot be overstated and\u000a        singularly contributed to the development of over 40 patents on\u000a        potential new drug products\" [E3].\u000a    Anagrelide (Xagrid or Agrylin&#174;) which is used to treat the\u000a      myeloproliferative disorder called essential thrombocythemia (ET) has\u000a      annual peak sales of $97 million [E4]. Individuals with raised\u000a      platelet counts have a higher risk of adverse thrombotic and haemorrhagic\u000a      events. Previous investigations identified a metabolite\u000a      3-hydroxyanagrelide, derived from oxidation of anagrelide. Whilst\u000a      anagrelide and 3-hydroxyanagrelide are similarly potent against ET, the\u000a      metabolite is nearly 40-fold more potent against\u000a      phosphodiesterase-III (PDE-III), which causes severe cardiovascular\u000a      side-effects. Based on prior Newcastle research a synthetic route to\u000a      3-hydroxyanagrelide was devised [P2] which made this biologically\u000a      potent molecule reliably available for the first time and enabled a full\u000a      determination of its pharmacological profile. An analogue of anagrelide\u000a      was developed (3,3-dimethylanagrelide, `Rafingrelide') [E4], which\u000a      retains potency against ET, but has much reduced activity against PDE-III.\u000a      This compound \"has completed phase 2 clinical testing...current\u000a        estimates of its market potential in the anti-thrombotic market exceed\u000a        $500 million\" [E3 Former Head of New Product Discovery (Small\u000a      molecules) at Shire]. Phase 2 clinical trials represent an average of\u000a      $19,300 per patient investment into the drug [E6].\u000a    During 2008-2012, a major contribution has been made to the Shire drug\u000a      guanfacine which is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\u000a      (ADHD) [E1]. Children with ADHD are deficient in normal social\u000a      skills and lack the ability to focus on tasks. Current sales for the\u000a      established ADHD drug Vyvanse approach $1030 million per annum [E4].\u000a      The alternative ADHD drug guanfacine has been converted into a novel\u000a      carbamate prodrug. Shire recently invested substantial effort via NewChem\u000a      in research for new prodrugs for alleviating pain. This has resulted in\u000a      the development of carbamate prodrugs of meptazinol and oxycodone, which\u000a      were produced by the synthetic methodologies analogous to those described\u000a      [P3]. NewChem studies for Shire have also created novel prodrugs of\u000a      the anti-Alzheimer drug galanthamine [E2]. Shire has requested that\u000a      the details of these prodrugs be kept confidential but we can disclose \"that\u000a        three compounds (not to be named) that...[NewChem researchers] worked on\u000a        were nominated for IND [Investigational New Drug] studies (2009-2012)\u000a        and two of these went into man [phase 1 trials in humans]\" [E5,\u000a      Senior Director Exploratory Projects, Shire].

Prior to\u000d\u000a      1993, inhibitors of PARP-1 were studied by Professor B Durkacz (1982-2009\u000d\u000a        &#8212; Professor of\u000d\u000a        Experimental Cancer Therapeutics; Northern Institute of Cancer\u000d\u000a        Research (NICR), Newcastle\u000d\u000a        University), but were of insufficient potency for clinical use.\u000d\u000a      Following these initial observations, a\u000d\u000a      translational research effort was instituted between the NICR and Golding\u000d\u000a      (1983 to date &#8212;\u000d\u000a        Professor of Organic Chemistry) and Griffin (1990 to date\u000d\u000a        &#8212; Professor of Medicinal Chemistry) in\u000d\u000a      the School of Chemistry. After considering the mode of action of PARP-1,\u000d\u000a      we conceived\u000d\u000a      benzimidazole and quinazolinone derivatives as possible effective\u000d\u000a      inhibitors [P1, P2] A synthetic\u000d\u000a      program was initiated, which led by 1995 to potent benzimidazole and\u000d\u000a      quinazolinone inhibitors.\u000d\u000a      These were much more effective than previously studied compounds and led,\u000d\u000a      in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      industrial partners (initially Agouron Pharmaceuticals), to the\u000d\u000a      first-in-class clinical candidate by\u000d\u000a      2000 [P3-P6].\u000d\u000a    The primary contributions from Newcastle research was thus the design of\u000d\u000a      new structural motifs for\u000d\u000a      inhibition of PARP-1 and devising efficient synthetic routes to libraries\u000d\u000a      of drug-like molecules\u000d\u000a      needed to exemplify the concept. The discovery of potent benzimidazole\u000d\u000a      inhibitors of PARP-1\u000d\u000a      enabled the support of a major pharmaceutical partner to be secured:\u000d\u000a      initially Agouron\u000d\u000a      Pharmaceuticals, world leaders in structure-based drug design (SBDD),\u000d\u000a      which was an emerging\u000d\u000a      technique in the 1990s. With the help of crystal structures of Newcastle\u000d\u000a      inhibitors bound to PARP-1\u000d\u000a      protein, the number of molecules synthesised through the collaboration\u000d\u000a      between the School of\u000d\u000a      Chemistry and Agouron chemists led to the identification of the clinical\u000d\u000a      candidate Rucaparib\u000d\u000a      (AG014699, PF-01367338). This partnership was noteworthy because it came\u000d\u000a      at a time when drug\u000d\u000a      resistance modifiers and chemo-\/radio-potentiators were considered to be\u000d\u000a      of limited commercial\u000d\u000a      value by the pharmaceutical sector. Our persistence and research therefore\u000d\u000a      validated PARP as a\u000d\u000a      viable target despite this prevailing attitude.\u000d\u000a    Preclinical research by the NICR validated the identified compounds as\u000d\u000a      inhibitors of the target\u000d\u000a      enzyme. Potentiation of the activity of alkylating agents (e.g.\u000d\u000a      temozolomide) and topoisomerase I\u000d\u000a      inhibitors (e.g. topotecan) was demonstrated in cell lines and also in\u000d\u000a      xenograft models. The much\u000d\u000a      wider clinical potential for PARP-1 inhibitors was shown by potentiation\u000d\u000a      of ionising radiation and of\u000d\u000a      cytotoxic drugs in a range of tumour types. After the clinical candidate\u000d\u000a      Rucaparib had been\u000d\u000a      identified, the Newcastle clinical team, with the support of Cancer\u000d\u000a      Research UK (Drug\u000d\u000a      Development Office), designed and executed a first-in-human,\u000d\u000a      first-in-class Phase I study of this\u000d\u000a      compound in combination with temozolomide. This study was designed to\u000d\u000a      provide both safety data\u000d\u000a      and proof-of-mechanism of action in a surrogate tissue and also in tumour\u000d\u000a      biopsies. It was one of\u000d\u000a      the first Phase I studies to rely on a therapeutic (pharmacodynamic)\u000d\u000a      endpoint rather than toxicity\u000d\u000a      and pharmacokinetics alone. The Newcastle PARP-1 team was also closely\u000d\u000a      involved in the\u000d\u000a      preclinical research that first demonstrated synthetic lethality with PARP\u000d\u000a      inhibitors in BRCA\u000d\u000a      defective cell lines and proposed the first proof-of-principal Phase II\u000d\u000a      study investigating this aspect.\u000d\u000a    In 2010, the PARP research team won Cancer Research UK's Translational\u000d\u000a      cancer research prize\u000d\u000a      which \"...recognises a team who have made a significant impact on the\u000d\u000a        continuing effort to\u000d\u000a        prevent, diagnose and cure cancer, and whose research is at the cutting\u000d\u000a        edge of scientific novelty\"\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/science.cancerresearchuk.org\/news\/prize-winners-2010-announced).\u000d\u000a      The intramural\u000d\u000a      Newcastle PARP team that initiated the project embraced medicinal\u000d\u000a      chemistry (Golding, Griffin),\u000d\u000a      molecular, cell and in vivo pharmacology (Curtin, 1989-date &#8212;\u000d\u000a        Professor of Experimental\u000d\u000a        Therapeutics; Newell, 1989-date &#8212; Professor of Cancer Therapeutics) and\u000d\u000a        medical oncology\u000d\u000a        (Calvert, 1990-2009 &#8212; Professor of Medical Oncology; Plummer &#8212; 2001-date\u000d\u000a        &#8212; Professor of\u000d\u000a        Experimental Cancer Medicine).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21355","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council","Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Station 9.8, with its unique design developed by Newcastle University\u000a      researchers, was the first dedicated facility of its kind in the world.\u000a      Its rapid and large oversubscription prompted the decision by SRS to\u000a      establish a second similar station by reallocation of an underused powder\u000a      diffraction beamline (16.2) a few years later. Both facilities operated\u000a      until mid-2008 and provided the model, inspiration and (through high\u000a      demand from users) justification for current facilities in the UK and\u000a      worldwide.

These two are the only current dedicated\u000a      beamlines of their kind in the world and are unrivalled in their output by\u000a      any shared- use facilities [E2, E3]; such other facilities include\u000a      beamlines at APS (USA) and Soleil (France), themselves influenced\u000a      indirectly by the design principles and the success of Station 9.8.\u000a    DLS is the largest UK Government-funded science project in a generation,\u000a      costing around &#163;400M in its construction to date and with an annual\u000a      operating budget rising from the initial &#163;23M in 2007-2008 as beamlines\u000a      are added; it provides a high level of employment and contribution to the\u000a      local economy. The I19 beamline had a construction budget of around &#163;5M\u000a      and its annual operating budget is &#163;430K excluding support for an average\u000a      of 3 PhD students per year; it has a full-time staff of 4 scientists and\u000a      technical support equivalent to 1.25 FTE.\u000a    In addition to providing the model for such facilities, the original\u000a      research has also produced leading scientists to manage and operate them.\u000a      Of grant-funded research staff employed for the construction and\u000a      commissioning stages of SRS 9.8, one is now Staff Scientist for ALS 11.3.1\u000a      (Dr Simon Teat, previously beamline scientist at SRS and Principal\u000a      Beamline Scientist for DLS I19), and another is a director of the\u000a      EPSRC-funded NCS (Dr Simon Coles). Major users\/beneficiaries of SRS 9.8\u000a      who are now in commercial and public service employment include Dr David\u000a      Allan (Principal Beamline Scientist for DLS I19), Dr Neil Feeder (Pfizer\u000a      then CCDC), and Dr Elizabeth Shotton (Industrial Liaison Manager, DLS).\u000a      Clegg has also helped provide training for over 150 staff and users of\u000a      synchrotron facilities from many countries through Synchrotron Radiation\u000a      Summer Schools, formerly at Chester\/Daresbury [E4 p.69] and currently at\u000a      Oxford\/Diamond.\u000a    Impact through commercial use of facilities\u000a    Around 10 commercial companies made use of SRS Station 9.8 up to 2008,\u000a      including all the major UK pharmaceutical firms; 5 companies from the\u000a      pharmaceutical and chemical sectors of UK industry currently use DLS\u000a      beamline I19 (one reason for the lower number is company mergers). These\u000a      companies are prepared to pay full-cost-recovery commercial rates for\u000a      access, since there is usually no other feasible way for them to obtain\u000a      vital structural information for the development and marketing of their\u000a      products when the available materials are poorly diffracting [E5].\u000a      Confidentiality agreements between the facilities and commercial customers\u000a      make it impossible to provide details of such usage, but we give some\u000a      examples here where results have been published or approved by company\u000a      representatives, or where the work is commercially-sponsored research by\u000a      academic partner teams; they are undoubtedly typical of other work. At\u000a      DLS, as previously at SRS, several days of beamtime in each 6-month\u000a      operating schedule are allocated to commercial work and a day of beamtime\u000a      can deliver up to 10 or more data sets, as an indication of overall usage.\u000a      Without the original Newcastle underpinning research, these opportunities\u000a      would probably not exist and the key structures would remain unknown.\u000a    For example, Organon (now Merck) used SRS 9.8 to investigate the\u000a      structure of a cyclodextrin complexed with a drug used as a neuromuscular\u000a      blocker, to confirm its mode of action. Sugammadex is now marketed as\u000a      Bridion; it was approved for use in the EU in 2008 and sales to date have\u000a      been around &#163;300M [E6; E4 pp. 7 &amp; 93].\u000a    Roche Discovery Welwyn, part of Hoffman LaRoche, carried out structural\u000a      studies at SRS 9.8, concentrating on active pharmaceutical ingredients,\u000a      intermediates and impurities in support of anti-inflammatory and\u000a      anti-viral programmes. This work contributed to the development of the\u000a      influenza neuraminidase inhibitor Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) and the\u000a      first-generation HIV protease inhibitor Invirase (saquinavir mesylate),\u000a      both originally licensed for use in the 1990s and in continued use today\u000a      [E7]. Tamiflu has had particularly high public profile and impact in\u000a      recent years as a major treatment during several big flu outbreaks around\u000a      the world. In the UK alone the NHS has spent an average of around &#163;70M per\u000a      year maintaining stocks of Tamiflu; annual worldwide sales peaked in 2009\u000a      and 2010 at around &#163;550M, then reduced by over 50%.\u000a    Commercial use of the SRS facilities was taken over by DLS I19 beamline\u000a      from 2009. Anhydrous sodium diclofenac was a key structure obtained by\u000a      SAFC Pharmorphix (Sigma-Aldrich) using DLS I19, enabling a thorough study\u000a      of relative stability of hydrates and other crystalline forms of this\u000a      common painkiller, which is one of the top 100 drugs in international use,\u000a      with an estimated annual value of about &#163;820M in 2009 [E7, E8 p.5, E9].\u000a      This work is typical of polymorphism and solvate studies carried out by\u000a      pharmaceutical companies, requiring synchrotron facilities for unstable\u000a      and poorly crystalline forms of important drugs and drug candidates in\u000a      order to secure and protect intellectual property rights attributable to\u000a      particular solid forms [E7].\u000a    Other major pharmaceutical firms who have confirmed their use of these\u000a      facilities in order to obtain or improve vital drug development structures\u000a      and to support regulatory and patent processes are Pfizer and\u000a      GlaxoSmithKlyne.\u000a    Impact through commercialisation or Government use of academic\u000a        research\u000a    Zeolites and metal-organic framework materials studied by St Andrews\u000a      chemists at SRS, DLS and ALS have led to Chevron Texaco patents on two\u000a      materials, SSZ-23 and SSZ-51, for use in oil refineries, three patents\u000a      related to storage and release of nitric oxide, and two spin-out\u000a      companies, Zeomedix LLC (started in 2009 with over $1M of external\u000a      investment to date) and MOFgen Ltd (started in 2013 with 14 commercial\u000a      agreements with other companies) [P3, E4 p.51, E10]. Metal-organic\u000a      frameworks have become popular research projects, of interest for\u000a      potential in hydrogen and other gas storage and energy applications. Work\u000a      is often industrially sponsored, such as that by Nottingham University\u000a      supported by General Motors [E7, p.17].\u000a    ALS 11.3.1 is used in projects of the US Department of Energy, including\u000a      gas separations for clean air technology, extraction of uranium from sea\u000a      water, and nuclear reprocessing [E2].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes impact from the Newcastle-led research project\u000a      to construct the world's first dedicated single-crystal diffraction\u000a      synchrotron beamline for chemistry and materials science at Daresbury\u000a      Laboratory Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS).

The technique faces ever-increasing demands for the study\u000a      of more complex molecular systems. The years 1994-1997 were the main\u000a      period of a major Newcastle-led research project to design, construct and\u000a      commission a single-crystal diffraction beamline (Station 9.8) at the SRS,\u000a      recognising the need for a facility that could greatly extend the range of\u000a      materials not otherwise amenable to conventional laboratory equipment.\u000a      Before Station 9.8 was built there were no dedicated facilities available\u000a      for the study of crystals with one or more dimensions on the micron scale\u000a      or other very weak scatterers, as laboratory facilities were not\u000a      sufficient, and so many important structural insights were lost.\u000a    The project team, led by Clegg, designed and set up Station 9.8 using a\u000a      modified laboratory diffractometer and detector system with X-ray optical\u000a      components in a novel combination to ensure that the equipment would\u000a      function successfully with the synchrotron source and also to combat\u000a      constraints of the available space. Other challenges overcome were the\u000a      needs for appropriate control and processing procedures and software, and\u000a      requirements for handling a wide range of samples, including air-sensitive\u000a      materials, to ensure maximum applicability [P1]. A primary objective was\u000a      to offer a familiar setup to a non-specialist first-time synchrotron user.\u000a    Overall project leadership and direction was maintained throughout by\u000a      Clegg, on site half-time at Daresbury from 1995 to 1998 through formal\u000a      Joint Appointments financed as research grants to Newcastle University to\u000a      cover 50% of salary costs; he was responsible for key decisions regarding\u000a      the choice of equipment, software and postdoctoral staffing as well as\u000a      conducting the extensive commissioning work using samples provided by\u000a      chemists from around the UK and abroad. Station 9.8 was the first\u000a      dedicated facility of its kind anywhere in the world [P2] and has enjoyed\u000a      immense success and productivity from the first commissioning data\u000a      measurement. In 1997, in accordance with the original plan and EPSRC grant\u000a      conditions, it was formally handed over by Newcastle University as a full\u000a      SRS user facility, on schedule, within budget, and with performance\u000a      exceeding the design specifications. It quickly became one of the most\u000a      heavily oversubscribed beamlines at Daresbury, with academic and\u000a      commercial users, generating between 10 and 20% of SRS-based publications\u000a      in subsequent years [P3, P4, P5 &amp; P6].\u000a    Continued use of the facility beyond 1997, and of its direct successor at\u000a      Diamond Light Source after 2008, by Clegg's Newcastle research group\u000a      included the establishment of a synchrotron-based component of the EPSRC\u000a      National Crystallography Service (NCS) in 2001, which further raised the\u000a      profile of the beamline and introduced its benefits to a wide range of UK\u000a      chemists, some of whom subsequently became commercial users, while others\u000a      were carrying out research projects with industrial partners; this\u000a      attraction of a large user community contributed hugely to the success of\u000a      the proposal to construct Diamond beamline I19.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"25834","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Current practices for therapeutic management of asthma and chronic\u000a      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rely heavily on treatment with\u000a      corticosteroids and 03b22-agonists, the former to control\u000a      underlying inflammatory dysfunction and the latter to afford symptomatic\u000a      relief for airway constriction. However, long-term use of corticosteroids\u000a      can produce adverse side effects, and the safety of long-acting &#946;2-agonists\u000a      is also currently under scrutiny. New safer and effective options for the\u000a      treatment of respiratory disease are therefore highly significant in their\u000a      potential societal and economic impact.\u000a    To pursue this goal, in 2000 Kyorin entered into an agreement with\u000a      Scottish Biomedical (SB), a technology management company founded jointly\u000a      by Scottish Universities in 1994, to set up a PDE biology research\u000a      facility, the Kyorin-Scotland Research Laboratory (KSRL), with an initial\u000a      project of &#163;5.2M. Consultancy oversight came from Prof. Miles Houslay\u000a      (University of Glasgow), one of the foremost authorities in the global PDE\u000a      biology community, while the medicinal chemistry direction was provided by\u000a      Adams. KSRL functioned to screen compounds initially provided largely by\u000a      Adams' medicinal chemistry group and the promising activity of emerging\u000a      compounds was central to the success of this initial programme, which\u000a      cemented the Kyorin-SB partnership. According to a senior manager of\u000a      Scottish Biomedical:\u000a    \"Prof Adams' group provided compound series and informed advice on all\u000a        aspects of the medicinal chemistry associated with the SB\/Kyorin\u000a        project. Prof Adams was one of the academic advisors employed for the\u000a        original project. His role allowed Kyorin to be confident that the\u000a        chemistry element of the project was being managed well and that\u000a        informed advice for the critical decision stages was available. Prof\u000a        Adams continued to play a vital role in the success of the first PDE\u000a        project which allowed a follow up project 3 years later. Prof Adams\u000a        contribution was essential to the success of the PDE programme (that)...\u000a        helped cement the partnership between Kyorin and SB.\"\u000a    In July 2002 a second &#163;5.2M project by Kyorin was agreed to extend the\u000a      KSRL portfolio to development of therapeutics for type 2 diabetes, and the\u000a      respiratory disease programme was extended for 3 years with a further\u000a      tranche of funding (&#163;4.5M) from 2003. Adams contributed medicinal\u000a      chemistry support throughout the period to 2006, eventually assisting SB\u000a      with the appointment of their own medicinal chemistry team. This completed\u000a      the transition of SB to a fully independent preclinical drug discovery\u000a      services company [text removed for publication].\u000a    The Adams group played an important role in establishing the PDE\u000a      medicinal chemistry research direction for Kyorin, and the success of the\u000a      work provided the basis for a major PDE drug development programme at\u000a      Kyorin's central Discovery Research Laboratories from 2004 and through the\u000a      current REF assessment period, employing 3 chemists and 6 biologists to\u000a      develop the work begun at HWU. The programme has generated 22 patents (18\u000a      published within the current REF assessment period) with a direct link to\u000a      the foundational work and direction contributed by HWU. A senior manager\u000a      at Kyorin's Discovery Research Laboratory in Japan stated that:\u000a    \"The work undertaken at Heriot-Watt University provided a substantive\u000a        benefit to Kyorin's PDE programme.\"\u000a    Throughout the current REF period Adams has continued to work with\u000a      Kyorin, developing a multi- part series of papers to disclose details of\u000a      the PDE programme and raise the company profile.1-6 These\u000a      papers evince the impact of the work performed in the Adams group in\u000a      shaping the direction of Kyorin's PDE programme. The success of the PDE\u000a      programme and establishment of a partnership with SB was also\u000a      strategically important to Kyorin in establishing a research network and\u000a      presence in Europe.\u000a    There is still considerable scope for bringing new best-in-class PDE4\u000a      inhibitors to the market as drugs with improved efficacy and reduced side\u000a      effect profiles for a range of inflammatory conditions in the respiratory\u000a      field and beyond. The first PDE4-selective inhibitor to reach the market,\u000a      roflumilast, was developed by the competitor company, Nycomed. Roflumilast\u000a      is indicated as a treatment for a subset of severe COPD cases and was\u000a      approved in the EU only in June 2010. It was subsequently also approved by\u000a      the FDA for use in the US (March 2011). A second PDE4 inhibitor,\u000a      apremilast from Celgene, will be launched in the near future as treatment\u000a      for psoriatic arthritis, with predicted annual sales of $1.5-2bn by 2017.\u000a      The global market for asthma\/COPD drugs, $38bn pa in 2012, is set to rise\u000a      to $47bn pa by 2017 [BCC Research].

The\u000a      intracellular levels of these species are regulated by as many as 11\u000a      phosphodiesterase gene families (PDE1-11). Prof. David Adams has worked on\u000a      phosphodiesterase at HWU for &gt;13 years and has collaborated with\u000a      internationally leading molecular biology groups to unravel key aspects of\u000a      PDE regulation and subcellular targeting. Work on mapping protein-binding\u000a      interfaces on PDE4 for key signalling complexes has been funded by MRC, EU\u000a      and Scottish Enterprise and has been carried out in collaboration with the\u000a      Houslay group (Glasgow and Strathclyde Universities).\u000a    PDE4 inhibitors have long been known to exhibit good anti-inflammatory\u000a      activity and modest bronchodilatory activity, and this prompted interest\u000a      in their development as a treatment option for respiratory disease. In the\u000a      1980s Kyorin developed ibudilast for use in asthma therapy and stroke in\u000a      Japan, the drug's pharmacological activity issuing, in part, from it being\u000a      a non-selective PDE inhibitor. Kyorin further developed the drug in the\u000a      1990s by coupling the ibudilast pyrazolopyridine core to a pyridazinone to\u000a      provide a new prototype compound, KCA-965. However, it remained unclear\u000a      what overall PDE-inhibitory profile was optimal for achieving dual\u000a      anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory action in a single compound. The\u000a      company therefore sought partnerships and as part of this between 2000 and\u000a      2006 they awarded ca. &#163;1.8M to Adams, allowing him to establish a\u000a      medicinal chemistry programme to develop PDE inhibitors from KCA-965.\u000a    Having developed appropriate synthetic methodology,1 Adams\u000a      brought a hypothesis-driven medicinal chemistry approach to develop a\u000a      series of novel pyrazolopyridine-pyridazinone inhibitors for enzymes of\u000a      the PDE3 and PDE4 families. By undertaking a structure-activity\u000a      relationship survey and employing conformationally constrained molecular\u000a      probes, the Adams group discovered that compounds within the series bind\u000a      to the catalytic pocket of PDE3 and PDE4 enzymes in a fundamentally\u000a      distinct manner, and that optimisation required structural reorganisation\u000a      of the pyrazolopyridine-pyridazinone core.2 This discovery\u000a      allowed the activity of compounds to be fine-tuned so as to provide either\u000a      potent selective PDE4 inhibitors or dual PDE3\/4-selective inhibitors with\u000a      promising biological activity.\u000a    An important feature of the programme at HWU was that it provided the\u000a      molecular tools to investigate the pharmacological benefit from targeting\u000a      both PDE3 and PDE4. At the outset of the work PDE4 inhibitors were already\u000a      known to exhibit modest bronchodilatory activity in addition to possessing\u000a      good anti-inflammatory activity. The bronchodilatory activity arises\u000a      because PDE inhibition leads to elevated cAMP levels in the airway smooth\u000a      muscle and so promotes relaxation. Both PDE4 and PDE3 mediate cAMP\u000a      hydrolysis, however, and inhibition of PDE3 is more effective than\u000a      inhibition of PDE4 for inducing airway smooth muscle relaxation. By\u000a      unlocking the structural determinants that control PDE3- and\u000a      PDE4-inhibitory selectivity in the HWU chemical series it was possible to\u000a      develop compounds with promising dual anti-inflammatory and\u000a      bronchorelaxant activity.2-6\u000a    Biological assessment of the compounds developed from the Adams group\u000a      medicinal chemistry programme was undertaken by the Kyorin-Scotland\u000a      Research Laboratory (KSRL), a facility set up in 2000 between Scottish\u000a      Biomedical (SB) and Kyorin with an initial &#163;5.2M investment.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"25835","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    NiTech Solutions Ltd was spun off from Heriot-Watt University in Dec\u000a      2004, aided by a SMART\u000a      award from Scottish Enterprise, with plug-flow crystallisation and\u000a      reaction as the key technologies\u000a      for chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. A second SMART award on\u000a      continuous\u000a      crystallisation supported Dr Anting Liao, Xiongwei Ni's ex-PhD student\u000a      from HWU, to be employed\u000a      at NiTech to carry out the designed trials. Excellent results were\u000a      generated; for example,\u000a      consistent crystal morphology\/size distribution\/enhanced yield,\u000a      significantly reduced process time\u000a      and waste, and elimination of the use of milling machines. An example of\u000a      the impact of the\u000a      technology is the continuous crystallisation of one of the AstraZeneca's\u000a      blockbuster drug\u000a      ingredients. In their operation in traditional crystallisers, it takes 9\u000a      hours and 40 minutes for the\u000a      crystallisation step; the filtration rate is poor because of uneven sizes\u000a      of crystals generated due to\u000a      the difficulties, identified above, of controlling the crystallisation\u000a      environment. In order to obtain the\u000a      required size a milling machine is used as one of the key downstream unit\u000a      operations. When\u000a      applying NiTech continuous crystallising technology, the overall process\u000a      was shown to take only 12\u000a      minutes with uniform sizes, enhanced filtration rates (which eliminate the\u000a      use of the milling\u000a      machine) and significant savings in capital and operational costs (see ref\u000a      [6] above).\u000a    Another leading example is the production of a biopharmaceutical drug in\u000a      Genzyme (now Sanofi).\u000a      In less than two years from conception in 2005, full production was\u000a      commissioned at the Haverhill\u000a      site in April 2007 after successful trials and design at NiTech as well as\u000a      the certification of the\u000a      process by the FDA. NiTech technology was used to launch production of a\u000a      new active\u000a      pharmaceutical ingredient (API) via a three-phase reaction on the scale of\u000a      multi-hundred tons p.a.\u000a      with a value of multi-&#163;100M p.a. The reaction is approximately 40 times\u000a      faster than a batch\u000a      process, with good flexibility to control throughput. The reactor was able\u000a      to fit into a small footprint\u000a      in an existing building, avoiding the traditional alternative of two large\u000a      pressure reactors and a new\u000a      building. There was a resultant saving of several million pounds in\u000a      capital expenditure and\u000a      approximately four times faster construction. Simplicity of operation and\u000a      reduced maintenance\u000a      costs have been sustained. Product quality is higher, with the ability to\u000a      continuously monitor and\u000a      control the reaction leading to a zero reject rate for this reaction step,\u000a      all contributing to a\u000a      competitive commercial advantage.

GSK provided\u000a      `model' crystallisation process and materials. Outstanding results were\u000a      obtained in these trials. It\u000a      was seen as an opportunity for Scotland to take the lead in meeting the\u000a      challenges facing chemical\u000a      manufacturing globally.

This\u000a      incurs significant financial\u000a      penalties and generates waste. The current norm is that for every 1 kg of\u000a      active pharmaceutical\u000a      ingredient (API) harvested, 50 to 200 kg of waste is produced. The typical\u000a      raw material cost for a\u000a      single batch of API is &#163;1 to &#163;5M. Many of these products (over 90% of\u000a      pharmaceuticals and 80%\u000a      of fine chemicals) are of crystalline form and involve a crystallisation\u000a      step in their production cycle.\u000a      The control of crystal purity, morphology and size distribution therefore\u000a      has a significant impact on\u000a      the efficiency and profitability of the overall production.\u000a    Research of Prof Xiongwei Ni at Heriot-Watt University has successfully\u000a      addressed the\u000a      underpinning physical principles that are responsible for these\u000a      limitations of traditional batch\u000a      reactors and crystallisers. The work was stimulated, in part, by the\u000a      results of a 9-year EPSRC-\u000a      funded project (part of which was carried out at HWU) `Chemicals Behaving\u000a      Badly'. This identified\u000a      that the key to delivering consistent product specifications included the\u000a      control of cooling (linear)\u000a      profile and the attainment of uniform mixing. However, neither of these\u000a      features is achievable in\u000a      industrial batch systems, due to the facts that mixing becomes less\u000a      efficient and the specific area\u000a      per unit volume for heat transfer decreases dramatically with scale. This\u000a      makes any controlled\u000a      cooling profiles problematic to implement in any industrial production.\u000a    Ni's research has focused on understanding the science of achieving\u000a      uniform mixing at all scales in\u000a      plug flow under laminar flow conditions1, 2 The\u000a      continuous oscillatory baffled reactor and crystalliser\u000a      technology developed as a result of this research combines both uniform\u000a      mixing with precise\u000a      temperature control, allowing any desired cooling profiles, e.g. linear,\u000a      nonlinear, step function,\u000a      parabolic, etc., to be achieved from lab to full scales. The applicability\u000a      of the technology has been\u000a      demonstrated for transport processes, reactions and crystallisation.3, 4\u000a\u0009  Major patents have been\u000a      filed on both apparatus and method.5 The technology eliminates\u000a      the two fundamental problems\u000a      encountered in traditional industrial scale crystallisers identified\u000a      above. It also enables kinetic\u000a      reaction time to be executed at all scales, shrinking the space required.\u000a      Unlike standard batch\u000a      systems, laboratory monitoring tools have been shown to be capable of\u000a      being implemented on\u000a      industrial scales without modification, facilitating smooth, direct and\u000a      fast transition from the\u000a      laboratory to production. Knowledge gained in the laboratory can be\u000a      applied directly in production,\u000a      again unlike in traditional full-scale operations due to the effects of\u000a      non-scalable mixing.\u000a    Trials with a large number of chemical, food and pharmaceutical compounds\u000a      (&gt;60) from various\u000a      industrial companies have firmly reinforced that the technology delivers\u000a      consistent product quality,\u000a      e.g. size distribution, morphology, yield and purity, with significant\u000a      reductions (&gt;90%) in process\u000a      time, waste and unwanted products, as well as in energy, utility, plant\u000a      size and inventory.6\u000a      Continuous reaction and crystallisation are now identified as critical\u000a      steps in process-intensification\u000a      drives to improve manufacturing in the chemical and pharmaceutical\u000a      industries, through more\u000a      efficient use of reagents, solvents and energy while minimizing side\u000a      reactions, unwanted products\u000a      and waste materials.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"25836","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Current practices for therapeutic management of asthma and chronic\u000d\u000a      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rely heavily on treatment with\u000d\u000a      corticosteroids and &#946;2-agonists, the former to control\u000d\u000a      underlying inflammatory dysfunction and the latter to afford symptomatic\u000d\u000a      relief for airway constriction. However, long-term use of corticosteroids\u000d\u000a      can produce adverse side effects, and the safety of long-acting &#946;2-agonists\u000a      is also currently under scrutiny. New safer and effective options for the\u000d\u000a      treatment of respiratory disease are therefore highly significant in their\u000d\u000a      potential societal and economic impact.\u000d\u000a    To pursue this goal, in 2000 Kyorin entered into an agreement with\u000d\u000a      Scottish Biomedical (SB), a technology management company founded jointly\u000d\u000a      by Scottish Universities in 1994, to set up a PDE biology research\u000d\u000a      facility, the Kyorin-Scotland Research Laboratory (KSRL), with an initial\u000d\u000a      project of &#163;5.2M. Consultancy oversight came from Prof. Miles Houslay\u000d\u000a      (University of Glasgow), one of the foremost authorities in the global PDE\u000d\u000a      biology community, while the medicinal chemistry direction was provided by\u000d\u000a      Adams. KSRL functioned to screen compounds initially provided largely by\u000d\u000a      Adams' medicinal chemistry group and the promising activity of emerging\u000d\u000a      compounds was central to the success of this initial programme, which\u000d\u000a      cemented the Kyorin-SB partnership. According to a senior manager of\u000d\u000a      Scottish Biomedical:\u000d\u000a    \"Prof Adams' group provided compound series and informed advice on all\u000d\u000a        aspects of the medicinal chemistry associated with the SB\/Kyorin\u000d\u000a        project. Prof Adams was one of the academic advisors employed for the\u000d\u000a        original project. His role allowed Kyorin to be confident that the\u000d\u000a        chemistry element of the project was being managed well and that\u000d\u000a        informed advice for the critical decision stages was available. Prof\u000d\u000a        Adams continued to play a vital role in the success of the first PDE\u000d\u000a        project which allowed a follow up project 3 years later. Prof Adams\u000d\u000a        contribution was essential to the success of the PDE programme (that)...\u000d\u000a        helped cement the partnership between Kyorin and SB.\"\u000d\u000a    In July 2002 a second &#163;5.2M project by Kyorin was agreed to extend the\u000d\u000a      KSRL portfolio to development of therapeutics for type 2 diabetes, and the\u000d\u000a      respiratory disease programme was extended for 3 years with a further\u000d\u000a      tranche of funding (&#163;4.5M) from 2003. Adams contributed medicinal\u000d\u000a      chemistry support throughout the period to 2006, eventually assisting SB\u000d\u000a      with the appointment of their own medicinal chemistry team. This completed\u000d\u000a      the transition of SB to a fully independent preclinical drug discovery\u000d\u000a      services company [text removed for publication].\u000d\u000a    The Adams group played an important role in establishing the PDE\u000d\u000a      medicinal chemistry research direction for Kyorin, and the success of the\u000d\u000a      work provided the basis for a major PDE drug development programme at\u000d\u000a      Kyorin's central Discovery Research Laboratories from 2004 and through the\u000d\u000a      current REF assessment period, employing 3 chemists and 6 biologists to\u000d\u000a      develop the work begun at HWU. The programme has generated 22 patents (18\u000d\u000a      published within the current REF assessment period) with a direct link to\u000d\u000a      the foundational work and direction contributed by HWU. A senior manager\u000d\u000a      at Kyorin's Discovery Research Laboratory in Japan stated that:\u000d\u000a    \"The work undertaken at Heriot-Watt University provided a substantive\u000d\u000a        benefit to Kyorin's PDE programme.\"\u000d\u000a    Throughout the current REF period Adams has continued to work with\u000d\u000a      Kyorin, developing a multi-part series of papers to disclose details of\u000d\u000a      the PDE programme and raise the company profile.1-6 These\u000d\u000a      papers evince the impact of the work performed in the Adams group in\u000d\u000a      shaping the direction of Kyorin's PDE programme. The success of the PDE\u000d\u000a      programme and establishment of a partnership with SB was also\u000d\u000a      strategically important to Kyorin in establishing a research network and\u000d\u000a      presence in Europe.\u000d\u000a    There is still considerable scope for bringing new best-in-class PDE4\u000d\u000a      inhibitors to the market as drugs with improved efficacy and reduced side\u000d\u000a      effect profiles for a range of inflammatory conditions in the respiratory\u000d\u000a      field and beyond. The first PDE4-selective inhibitor to reach the market,\u000d\u000a      roflumilast, was developed by the competitor company, Nycomed. Roflumilast\u000d\u000a      is indicated as a treatment for a subset of severe COPD cases and was\u000d\u000a      approved in the EU only in June 2010. It was subsequently also approved by\u000d\u000a      the FDA for use in the US (March 2011). A second PDE4 inhibitor,\u000d\u000a      apremilast from Celgene, will be launched in the near future as treatment\u000d\u000a      for psoriatic arthritis, with predicted annual sales of $1.5-2bn by 2017.\u000d\u000a      The global market for asthma\/COPD drugs, $38bn pa in 2012, is set to rise\u000d\u000a      to $47bn pa by 2017 [BCC Research]. Kyorin's own PDE programme therefore\u000d\u000a      remains an important asset in its portfolio of inflammatory and\u000d\u000a      respiratory disease research.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Phosphodiesterase (PDE) research by Prof. David Adams of Heriot-Watt\u000d\u000a      University (HWU) has discovered compounds with potent combined\u000d\u000a      anti-inflammatory and bronchorelaxant activity, relevant to asthma and\u000d\u000a      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The\u000d\u000a      intracellular levels of these species are regulated by as many as 11\u000d\u000a      phosphodiesterase gene families (PDE1-11). Prof. David Adams has worked on\u000d\u000a      phosphodiesterase at HWU for &gt;13 years and has collaborated with\u000d\u000a      internationally leading molecular biology groups to unravel key aspects of\u000d\u000a      PDE regulation and subcellular targeting. Work on mapping protein-binding\u000d\u000a      interfaces on PDE4 for key signalling complexes has been funded by MRC, EU\u000d\u000a      and Scottish Enterprise and has been carried out in collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      Houslay group (Glasgow and Strathclyde Universities).\u000d\u000a    PDE4 inhibitors have long been known to exhibit good anti-inflammatory\u000d\u000a    activity and modest bronchodilatory activity, and this prompted interest in\u000d\u000a    their development as a treatment option for respiratory disease. In the\u000d\u000a    1980s Kyorin developed ibudilast for use in asthma therapy and stroke in\u000d\u000a    Japan, the drug's pharmacological activity issuing, in part, from it being a\u000d\u000a    non-selective PDE inhibitor. Kyorin further developed the drug in the 1990s\u000d\u000a    by coupling the ibudilast pyrazolopyridine core to a pyridazinone to provide\u000d\u000a    a new prototype compound, KCA-965. However, it remained unclear what overall\u000d\u000a    PDE-inhibitory profile was optimal for achieving dual anti-inflammatory and\u000d\u000a    bronchodilatory action in a single compound. The company therefore sought\u000d\u000a    partnerships and as part of this between 2000 and 2006 they awarded ca.\u000d\u000a    &#163;1.8M to Adams, allowing him to establish a medicinal chemistry programme to\u000d\u000a    develop PDE inhibitors from KCA-965.\u000d\u000a    Having developed appropriate synthetic methodology,1 Adams\u000d\u000a      brought a hypothesis-driven medicinal chemistry approach to develop a\u000d\u000a      series of novel pyrazolopyridine-pyridazinone inhibitors for enzymes of\u000d\u000a      the PDE3 and PDE4 families. By undertaking a structure-activity\u000d\u000a      relationship survey and employing conformationally constrained molecular\u000d\u000a      probes, the Adams group discovered that compounds within the series bind\u000d\u000a      to the catalytic pocket of PDE3 and PDE4 enzymes in a fundamentally\u000d\u000a      distinct manner, and that optimisation required structural reorganisation\u000d\u000a      of the pyrazolopyridine-pyridazinone core.2 This discovery\u000d\u000a      allowed the activity of compounds to be fine-tuned so as to provide either\u000d\u000a      potent selective PDE4 inhibitors or dual PDE3\/4-selective inhibitors with\u000d\u000a      promising biological activity.\u000d\u000a    An important feature of the programme at HWU was that it provided the\u000d\u000a      molecular tools to investigate the pharmacological benefit from targeting\u000d\u000a      both PDE3 and PDE4. At the outset of the work PDE4 inhibitors were already\u000d\u000a      known to exhibit modest bronchodilatory activity in addition to possessing\u000d\u000a      good anti-inflammatory activity. The bronchodilatory activity arises\u000d\u000a      because PDE inhibition leads to elevated cAMP levels in the airway smooth\u000d\u000a      muscle and so promotes relaxation. Both PDE4 and PDE3 mediate cAMP\u000d\u000a      hydrolysis, however, and inhibition of PDE3 is more effective than\u000d\u000a      inhibition of PDE4 for inducing airway smooth muscle relaxation. By\u000d\u000a      unlocking the structural determinants that control PDE3- and\u000d\u000a      PDE4-inhibitory selectivity in the HWU chemical series it was possible to\u000d\u000a      develop compounds with promising dual anti-inflammatory and\u000d\u000a      bronchorelaxant activity.2-6\u000d\u000a    Biological assessment of the compounds developed from the Adams group\u000d\u000a      medicinal chemistry programme was undertaken by the Kyorin-Scotland\u000d\u000a      Research Laboratory (KSRL), a facility set up in 2000 between Scottish\u000d\u000a      Biomedical (SB) and Kyorin with an initial &#163;5.2M investment.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"25837","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Stars `r' Us! uses highly interactive exhibits to show how information\u000d\u000a      obtained from telescopic\u000d\u000a      observations, laboratory experiments and computer modelling is used to\u000d\u000a      infer clues about the\u000d\u000a      possible chemical origins of life.

SRU is broadly based and draws on the activities of all\u000d\u000a      its partners. The key\u000d\u000a      themes that SRU explores are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The role of spectroscopy in observing the chemical composition of the\u000d\u000a        local and more\u000d\u000a        distant universe;\u000d\u000a      The importance of small molecules in controlling the formation of\u000d\u000a        small, long-lived stars;\u000d\u000a      The interplay between chemistry in the gas phase and on dust grains;\u000d\u000a      The role of surface and solid state chemistry in developing a rich\u000d\u000a        organic chemistry in star-forming\u000d\u000a        regions;\u000d\u000a      The importance of that rich organic chemistry in seeding the galaxy\u000d\u000a        and the universe with\u000d\u000a        the chemical potential for life.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The work of the HWU Astrochemistry Group focuses on the broad theme of\u000d\u000a      the role of surface and\u000d\u000a      solid-state physics and chemistry in evolving the chemical complexity of\u000d\u000a      the regions where stars\u000d\u000a      and planets are formed towards the chemical progenitors of life; this has\u000d\u000a      a direct impact on the\u000d\u000a      final three bullet points listed above. That complexity can be observed to\u000d\u000a      a very limited extent in\u000d\u000a      the solid state, but infrared spectroscopy is insufficiently sensitive and\u000d\u000a      characteristic to provide\u000d\u000a      information on anything but the most abundant chemical species in the\u000d\u000a      solid state. However,\u000d\u000a      desorption and release of complex organic molecules into the gas phase\u000d\u000a      allows many more of the\u000d\u000a      chemical species present in these distant environments to be detected. The\u000d\u000a      on-going development\u000d\u000a      of sensitive new observational platforms such as ALMA is revealing the\u000d\u000a      details of the complex\u000d\u000a      molecular inventory of the Universe.

The work listed highlights the role of laboratory\u000d\u000a      measurements of both thermal [1 - 3]\u000d\u000a      and non-thermal desorption [4 - 6] of molecules under conditions that\u000d\u000a      mimic the interstellar\u000d\u000a      medium. The first set of three publications relate to the development of\u000d\u000a      an understanding of the\u000d\u000a      thermal desorption of icy grain mantles [1 - 3], a process that is crucial\u000d\u000a      to the chemical control of\u000d\u000a      the star formation process. On the basis of this work at HWU, these\u000d\u000a      processes are better\u000d\u000a      described in physicochemical models of such environments. The latter three\u000d\u000a      papers describe\u000d\u000a      recent and on-going work on desorption processes induced by light and\u000d\u000a      charged particles [4 - 6]\u000d\u000a      that are crucial in returning complex organic species to the interstellar\u000d\u000a      gas and compete effectively\u000d\u000a      with chemical evolution within radiation-rich environments. These\u000d\u000a      discoveries and the\u000d\u000a      understanding they provide of the processes that enrich the interstellar\u000d\u000a      gas with complex organic\u000d\u000a      molecules directly inform our discussion of the chemical evolution of the\u000d\u000a      Universe when engaging\u000d\u000a      with the public.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28086","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context\u000a    Despite the advantageous electroluminescent and photoluminescent\u000a      properties of quantum dot nanoparticles, their incorporation into\u000a      next-generation consumer electronics has been precluded by the absence of\u000a      a means to manufacture both sufficient quantities and materials that are\u000a      free of toxic heavy metals in-order to comply with `Restriction of\u000a      Hazardous Substances' (RoHS) legislation.\u000a    Pathways to impact\u000a      The research conducted at the University of Manchester enabled the\u000a      preparation of bulk quantities of quantum dots free of toxic heavy metals,\u000a      which led to the spinout of Nanoco Technologies in 2001-2 from the School\u000a      of Chemistry based on its proprietary technology covered, by 19 patents\u000a      [4,5].\u000a    Whilst located within the School of Chemistry building, Nanoco grew to\u000a      10-12 workers before moving to dedicated premises where it experienced\u000a      extraordinary growth between 2004-2013.

Currently, Nanoco's quantum dot's are being\u000a      developed with its strategic partners in several areas including displays\u000a      and photovoltaic solar cells as follows:-\u000a    1. Displays\u000a      Display technology has progressed from bulky cathode ray tubes to plasma\u000a      screens, liquid crystal displays and more recently to energy efficient\u000a      organic light emitting diodes (OLED). OLED technology has provided low\u000a      power, lightweight, thinner displays of improved user experience through\u000a      wider viewing angles and improved contrast. However, OLED\u000a      display technology is limited to the fabrication of small displays\u000a      employing wasteful and energy inefficient evaporation procedures with a\u000a      high discard rates.\u000a    Quantum dot electroluminescent display technology (QD TV&#8482;) offers a\u000a      tremendous advantage over existing OLED-technology. Quantum dots have been\u000a      printed using facile low cost techniques into various sizes of lightweight\u000a      flexible displays. High photoluminescence quantum yields render the\u000a      displays energy efficient, narrow emission band-width provides displays of\u000a      superior optical resolution, whilst the high stability of inorganic\u000a      quantum dots provides displays with improved lifetimes.\u000a    Since 2011, Nanoco has delivered 1kg batches of both red and green\u000a      coloured quantum dots worth &#163;2.5m and achieved performance milestones that\u000a      have generated an additional &#163;1.1M.

Photovoltaic solar cells\u000a      The world's growing demand for power is met predominantly by the\u000a      combustion of fossil fuels (13TW, 87%). As fossil fuels become depleted\u000a      and the demand for cleaner, greener energy increases it is imperative that\u000a      renewable energy becomes a more significant proportion of our energy mix.\u000a      Currently, solar power contributes a negligible 0.03% toward the global\u000a      energy mix despite the earth receiving sufficient energy from the sun to\u000a      meet its current and future energy demand (&gt;120,000 TW). The widespread\u000a      adoption of solar power has been impeded by the high cost of cells,\u000a      principally of silicon fabricated by expensive methods.\u000a    In partnership with a Japanese automotive firm that has invested\u000a      approximately &#163;1m and `Tokyo Electron' who have invested an undisclosed\u000a      amount, Nanoco has exploited its proprietary intellectual property and\u000a      expertise to prepare a range of novel copper indium gallium diselenide and\u000a      copper indium diselenide quantum dot inks that have been fabricated into\u000a      solar cell devices of good efficiencies using conventional low cost\u000a      printing techniques [D].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Nanoco, is a University of Manchester spin out company having a current\u000a      market capitalisation of &#163;384m (31\/7\/2013).

[4,5]\u000a    The research was carried out by key Manchester researchers:\u000a    \u000a      Paul O'Brien &#8212; Professor of Materials Chemistry (1999-present);\u000a      Nigel Picket &#8212; PDRA (2000-2004);\u000a      Steve Daniels &#8212; PhD student (2001-2004).\u000a    \u000a    Most often, quantum dots have been prepared by `hot-injection methods'\u000a      rapidly introducing solutions of often hazardous precursor compounds into\u000a      a vast excess of hot solvent, resulting in nucleation and subsequent\u000a      growth of the quantum dot nanoparticles by `heating-up' methodologies.

[O'Hagan, J. Fluorine Chem. 2010, 131,\u000a      1071]\u000a    The presence of a fluorine atom can confer advantageous potency,\u000a      selectivity and\/or metabolic stability attributes to prospective drug\u000a      candidate molecules. This desirability is tempered by the harsh and\u000a      hazardous nature of conventional fluorinating agents; many different\u000a      electrophilic fluorinating agents have been investigated, but most are\u000a      insufficiently reactive, too hazardous or too expensive for large-scale\u000a      applications. Selectfluor&#174; was developed at Manchester, and between 1993\u000a      and 2004 was demonstrated to fluorinate complex molecules, to the point\u000a      where it has now been adopted as the method of choice in industry for the\u000a      synthesis of a wide range of products, including being the preferred\u000a      fluorinating reagent in medicinal chemistry drug discovery projects within\u000a      Pfizer \"SelectFluor&#174; is a milder, safer and more easily\u000a        handled alternative to DAST (diethylaminosulfur trifluoride) and, as\u000a        such, it is a preferred fluorinating reagent in medicinal chemistry drug\u000a        discovery projects within Pfizer\" (Senior Director, Worldwide\u000a      Medicinal Chemistry &#8212; Oncology, Pfizer) [A], and used to prepare one of\u000a      the most prescribed billion-dollar fluorosteroid products in the modern\u000a      pharmaceutical industry. \"Prior to Selectfluor&#174;'s discovery and\u000a        development, only a very few companies would dare face the challenges of\u000a        producing fluorinated steroids because of the necessity to obtain and\u000a        handle perchlorylfluoride, the only reagent available at the time to\u000a        provide electrophilic fluorination.\u000a    [Previously] perchlorylfluoride used in the production of\u000a        fluorosteroids had resulted in the fatalities of 2 production workers,\u000a        and as a result, the industry refused to consider commercial production\u000a        using the reagent. With the development of Selectfluor&#174; chemistry,\u000a        this stable, safe, and readily handled white solid made it possible for\u000a        any company wishing to introduce electrophilic fluorination to do so.\u000a        Selectfluor&#174; was a game-changing innovation for commercial\u000a        production of fluorinated steroids\" (Research Fellow, Arkema &#8212;\u000a      formerly at Air Products) [B].\u000a    Pathways to impact\u000a    Selectfluor&#174; was developed in Manchester by Professor R.

Following its\u000a      development the research carried out in Manchester determined and\u000a      exemplified the reactivity and conditions of use for Selectfluor&#174; which\u000a      has subsequently led to it becoming the world's most widely adopted\u000a      electrophilic fluorinating agent to date.\u000a    Our publications of Selectfluor&#174;'s reactivity and protocols for its use\u000a      were published between 1994 and 1999, shortly afterwards patents\u000a      describing the application of Selectfluor&#174; started to appear. In total\u000a      from 1993 to 2012, there have been 134 patents published which cite\u000a      Selectfluor&#174; (SciFinder search 07.01.2013), that cover a wide range of\u000a      multinational companies, countries and scientific areas.\u000a    Impact\u000a    As the chemistry and applications of Selectfluor&#174; were developed and the\u000a      industrial relevance of this compound became obvious Selectfluor&#174;\u000a      production was developed over a 5 year period onto a commercial scale. It\u000a      is now produced on a multi-tonne quantity in America, China and other\u000a      countries, with estimated annual production and sales figures of ca. 25\u000a      tonnes and $7.5m (USD) per annum [C].\u000a    `Selectfluor&#174;'s widespread availability at commercial volumes\u000a        and its acceptance by both academic and industrial chemists changed the\u000a        way researchers and process development chemists in pharmaceutical and\u000a        agricultural industries think about fluorination. Selectfluor&#174; became\u000a        the first tool of choice for any process requiring electrophilic\u000a        fluorination and even today it remains the most popular reagent used'\u000a      (Research Fellow, Arkema &#8212; formerly at Air Products) [B].\u000a    This has impacted on some of the largest pharmaceutical companies, for\u000a      example: Bayer for the application and processes for the preparation of\u000a      halogen-substituted compounds, for controlling animal pests, especially\u000a      arthropods, arachnids and nematodes; Pfizer for the synthesis of fluorine-\u000a      containing morpholine compounds as therapeutic mineralocorticoid receptor\u000a      antagonists to control hypertension, congestive heart failure and chronic\u000a      kidney disease; Glaxo Group Ltd for Napththyrdin-2(1H) based compounds of\u000a      use as antibacterials, for example in the treatment of tuberculosis;\u000a      AstraZeneca AB for the synthesis of compounds used as selective\/potent\u000a      GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) inhibitors of relevance to treatment in\u000a      chronic and acute neurodegenerative diseases, Alzhimer's disease,\u000a      Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, diabetes, inflammatory diseases and\u000a      cancers.\u000a    The area in which the chemistry of Selectfluor&#174; has had the most\u000a      significant impact is as the electrophilic fluorinating agent of choice\u000a      for the generation of fluorine-substituted corticosteroids used as\u000a      anti-inflammatory drugs [D,E]. It is estimated that ca. 80 % of the\u000a      currently produced fluorinated steroids, critical for the improvement in\u000a      quality of many people's lives, are produced using Selectfluor&#174; and this\u000a      is backed up by the patent literature [O'Hagan, J.

Since the development of Selectfluor&#174;'s chemistry companies,\u000a      such as Hovione, Taro and Farmabios, have patented Selectfluor&#174;-based\u000a      methods as their preferred routes, including (but not limited to) EP\u000a      1207166 (2002), WO 02\/100878 (2002) [F], US 7098328 (2006) [G], and US\u000a      7718793 (2010) [H].

Knowledge transfer is also\u000a      facilitated through tailored\u000a      CPD and training events for industry in thematic areas where OMIC has\u000a      recognized academic\u000a      excellence.\u000a    Impact: Through its position as one of the UK's four academic,\u000a      plastic electronics centres of\u000a      excellence, as recognised in the House of Commons Select Report in 2008\u000a      [D], OMIC is a\u000a      founding member of the Plastic Electronics Leadership Group and these\u000a      activities are helping to\u000a      advocate and shape the UK strategy in this emerging field and direct TSB\u000a      funding in the area.\u000a      Internationally, OMIC through Professor Yeates was invited to contribute\u000a      as experts to the\u000a      international White Paper from the Chemical Sciences and Society Summit\u000a      (CS3) on `Organic\u000a      Electronics for a Better Tomorrow: Innovation, Accessibility,\u000a      Sustainability' 2012 and also the EU\u000a      project on developing the roadmap for digital fabrication `Diginova'. As\u000a      part of this advocacy, OMIC\u000a      has hosted inward investment missions from Finland, Korea and Belgium as\u000a      well as providing\u000a      training to over 250 people in industry since 2008. Events have included\u000a      `Future generation solar\u000a      cells' in 2008, `Opportunities in printed solar cells', 2009, and\u000a      `Chemicals and materials for printed\u000a      electronics', 2011. A recent survey by the Plastic Electronics Leadership\u000a      Group confirmed that\u000a      while the industry is still in its infancy, there are now over 150\u000a      businesses in the UK with activities\u000a      in this field, more than double that of four years ago. Most of those are\u000a      SMEs developing materials\u000a      and devices but there are already some end-users such as De La Rue and\u000a      Reckitt-Benckiser\u000a      working to apply the technology in their products.\u000a    ACAL Energy [E]\u000a    Context: Fuel cells produce electrical power directly from\u000a      chemicals and offer the potential to be a\u000a      more efficient and clean way to generate power when compared to the\u000a      combustion of fuels.\u000a      Hydrogen-fuelled 10-100 kW fuel cells provide a cost-effective method for\u000a      power production\u000a      particularly at sites where lower life-cycle costs, cleaner and quieter\u000a      operation, longer runtimes,\u000a      and lower maintenance requirements are important. However concerns over\u000a      cost and lifetime have\u000a      limited their adoption. ACAL Energy is an UK SME developing a novel\u000a      approach to the fuel cell\u000a      cathode &#8212; the FlowCath&#174; technology.\u000a    Pathways to Impact: ACAL Energy collaborated with the Collison and\u000a      May (2) group by\u000a      embedding a company scientist within the group and by consultancy from\u000a      2006, because of their\u000a      expertise on polyoxometallates. This research led to the initial FlowCath&#174;\u000a      technology. Collaboration\u000a      with the Turner and Proctor groups (5) through a combination of the\u000a      flexible OMIC model, KTP and\u000a      PhD funding on novel nitrogen-containing ligands is enabling more\u000a      efficient fuel cells to be\u000a      developed.\u000a    Impact: Since 2008 ACAL Energy has received &#163;15m of venture\u000a      capital investment, created in\u000a      excess of 20 jobs and won the Carbon Trust's Polymer Fuel Cell Challenge.\u000a      ACAL Energy's\u000a      patented FlowCath&#174; technology is the first example of a non-Pt\u000a      based fuel cell cathode system and\u000a      the first installation is now located in at the Solvay Interox Chemical\u000a      Plant, UK. ACAL Energy fuel\u000a      cells using a polyoxometallate catalyst compete with conventional\u000a      electricity generators by\u000a      reducing the platinum content by up to 80% which represents 20-25 % of the\u000a      total cost of a system.\u000a      These fuel cells show no deterioration in performance after 10,000 hrs of\u000a      rigorous automotive test\u000a      cycles (equivalent to 300,000 miles). This is comparable to the best\u000a      light-weight diesel engines\u000a      (100kW equivalent to a 2 L diesel engine) and exceeds the 2017 US\u000a      Department of Energy (DoE)\u000a      industry target for fuel cell powered vehicles. The durability of the fuel\u000a      cells allows the system to be\u000a      applied to stationary power applications where 40,000 hrs (10 years of\u000a      product lifetime) operation\u000a      is required. As a result ACAL Energy fuel cell units will be installed at\u000a      the UK's first open access H2\u000a      refuelling station to be located at Honda's manufacturing site in Swindon.\u000a    Byotrol [F]\u000a    Context: Cleaning products, such as bleach and alcohol-based\u000a      products, stop working as soon as\u000a      they dry, which allows bacteria and other microbes to quickly recolonize;\u000a      a single surviving\u000a      bacterium can produce up to 8 million descendants by the next day. In\u000a      contrast, Byotrol technology\u000a      which is based upon surfactant-polymer mixtures kills and destroys\u000a      instantaneously bacteria and\u000a      viruses and then dries to form a long-lasting antimicrobial barrier that\u000a      stops germs from\u000a      re-populating for up to 24 hrs.\u000a    Pathways to Impact: In 2007, Byotrol approached the University of\u000a      Manchester based upon our\u000a      previous work in the area of complex aqueous surfactant mixtures [3], and\u000a      our then unpublished\u000a      work on complex aqueous polymer-surfactant mixtures [6] with the aim of\u000a      understanding the\u000a      mechanism of long-lasting antimicrobial performance and of developing more\u000a      effective and\u000a      reproducible formulations which in turn could lead to a stronger IP\u000a      position in this highly\u000a      competitive market. This resulted in the filing of patent WO2010043863,\u000a      which covers and\u000a      exemplifies novel formulation classes, addressing the dual challenges of\u000a      effective antimicrobial kill\u000a      coupled with long term follow-on performance. This was continued by a one\u000a      year Molecular\u000a      Engineering Translational Research Centre (METRC) proof of concept grant\u000a      in 2009-2010 and\u000a      supported by a direct funded iCASE PhD 2009-13.\u000a    Impact: The research performed under the above engagement modes\u000a      has contributed to the\u000a      technology being further developed and optimized to provide reproducible,\u000a      fast acting and powerful\u000a      performance across all microbial classes [E]: bacteria, viruses, fungi,\u000a      moulds &amp; algae killing up to\u000a      99.99% of germs in 30 seconds when tested against the most stringent test\u000a      methodologies\u000a      including BS:EN 1276 Standard, BS:EN 13697 Standard, BS:EN 1650 Standard,\u000a      BS:EN 14476\u000a      Standard and Residual Abrasion Testing methodologies. In 2013, Byotrol\u000a      reported sales of &#163;2.19m\u000a      with a year-on-year growth of 12% per annum. Byotrol technology has been\u000a      introduced into a wide\u000a      range of consumer products across the healthcare, food and beverage and\u000a      consumer goods\u000a      sectors [E], through both direct sales and partnership with some of the\u000a      world's leading brands\u000a      including Boots, PZ Cussons, Heinz, Kimberley Clark, Marks and Spencer and\u000a      Rentokil Initial\u000a      Group (UltraProtect&#8482;).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The activities of the Organic Materials Innovation Centre (OMIC) at the\u000a      University of Manchester\u000a      generate impact from its research activities through knowledge transfer to\u000a      industry.

It is able to determine, for example,\u000d\u000a      the composition of a mixture, the structures of complex molecules, and the\u000d\u000a      mobilities of these molecules. However, to direct the complex and\u000d\u000a      precisely-timed sequences of radiofrequency and magnetic field pulses that\u000d\u000a      are used in an NMR spectrometer to measure these different properties of\u000d\u000a      substances is a science in itself. The Impact described in this case\u000d\u000a      relates to the development and commercial exploitation of one such family\u000d\u000a      of pulse sequences, known as DOSY, that is able to analyse complex\u000d\u000a      mixtures in a unique manner that has proved vital to industrial research\u000d\u000a      and product development.\u000d\u000a    Pathways to impact\u000d\u000a    The initial impetus for our developments in DOSY came from an industrial\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Pfizer Global Research, and led to dedicated processing\u000d\u000a      software which was initially shared widely but informally with other\u000d\u000a      users. The subsequent development of DOSY software for the proprietary\u000d\u000a      operating system of the major NMR manufacturer Varian (now Agilent) gave\u000d\u000a      both the opportunity to exploit the intellectual property generated, and\u000d\u000a      an effective vehicle for disseminating the results to a wide range of\u000d\u000a      users including many industrial research organisations. Key contributors\u000d\u000a      to this Impact were the School policy of maintaining shared\u000d\u000a      high-resolution NMR facilities, and the assistance of UMIP (University of\u000d\u000a      Manchester Intellectual Property management agent) in negotiating the\u000d\u000a      licensing of DOSY software.

The principle of the\u000a      technique is to bombard\u000a      the surface with a beam of ions (the primary ion beam) and then analyse\u000a      the emitted particles (in\u000a      the form of `secondary ions') that is ejected from the sample, using mass\u000a      spectrometry.\u000a    Previously, for in-depth or 3D analysis, SIMS had been limited to the\u000a      analysis of inorganic\u000a      materials due to the aggressive nature of the primary ion beam employed.\u000a      Traditional primary ion\u000a      beams based on Ar+, Ga+, Cs+ and more\u000a      recently Aun+n and Bin+\u000a      cause significant damage to the\u000a      underlying surface of the material, which restricted the amount of\u000a      meaningful information that could\u000a      be obtained to less than 1% of the sample surface.\u000a    Fundamental research in the late 1980's suggested that cluster molecules\u000a      may serve as a more\u000a      effective primary ion beam system than the simple atomic ions in use at\u000a      the time. Research by the\u000a      Vickerman group led to the development of a prototype C60+\u000a      primary ion beam system for SIMS .\u000a      The C60+ primary ion beam is generated by ionising C60\u000a      molecules with a stream of electrons. The\u000a      resultant positively charged C60+ particles are\u000a      accelerated to collide with the surface of the sample.\u000a      Through the first application of C60+ bombardment\u000a      for practical SIMS analysis we demonstrated a\u000a      ~1000 fold increase in secondary ion yields of `molecular' ions enabling\u000a      high sensitivity surface\u000a      analysis [1]. This pioneering development yields sub-micron spatial\u000a      resolution for examination of\u000a      organic materials and systems in life sciences [2-5]. Moreover, a\u000a      substantial reduction in\u000a      bombardment-induced damage of the sample permitted up to 100% of the\u000a      sample to be analysed\u000a      providing unprecedented depth profiling of successive layers and 3D\u000a      chemical imaging of organic\u000a      materials [2,3] including the first 3D molecular SIMS analysis of a single\u000a      biological cell [4]. Beyond\u000a      SIMS, the rather gentle molecular erosion under C60 bombardment\u000a      allows other 'surface analysis'\u000a      methods including X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe\u000a      sub-surface chemistry.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28939","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Key impacts have been:\u000a    \u000a      2 new businesses (Chemtrix BV and ChemtrixUSA).\u000a      13 jobs created including 4 PhDs, 3 MScs and 4 engineers.\u000a      The development of 3 innovative products (Labtrix&#174;&#9633;\u000a        KiloFlow&#174; and Plantrix&#174;) with a growing\u000a        international industrial and academic customer base.\u000a    \u000a    New businesses: After receiving substantial investment from Dutch\u000a      investors, the Headquarters of\u000a      Chemtrix was established in Geleen (Netherlands) in April 2008; and\u000a      product development and\u000a      sales actively commenced.

Independent evidence is reported\u000a      by Ley.[E] In addition,\u000a      Chemtrix is the only micro-reactor supplier to manufacture a reactor\u000a      (Figure 1c) that enables the\u000a      incorporation of heterogeneous catalysts.[D]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFigure 1.

Consequently, reacting to market demand, Chemtrix in 2010\u000a      launched Labtrix&#174; Start\u000a      (Figure 2). Sales of this product have been particularly high, both within\u000a      academia and industry\u000a      (independent evidence reported by Kappe[F]) with more than 40\u000a      units of this type sold to date ~\u000a      40:60 academic to industrial end users.\u000a\u000aFigure 2 Labtrix&#174; Start (launched 2010).\u000a\u000a    Scale up production from Labtrix&#174;using `meso' scale reactors\u000a      (KiloFlow&#174; launched 2011, 3 installed and 2 in production)\u000a      which consists of mm-size channels (Figure 3a). Through\u000a      carrying out detailed ongoing research into available static\u000a      mixer technology, the Company has developed the ability to\u000a      translate the reaction conditions identified in micro-channels to\u000a      meso-channels, where combination of these modules (Figure\u000a      4b) affords access to production-scale quantities (g-kg's) within\u000a      a standard laboratory fume cupboard.[G,H] A partnership with\u000a      ESK has enabled Chemtrix to develop silicon carbide reactors\u000a      capable of achieving production rates at the tonne-scale (Figure\u000a      3b) which will service a growing industrial market estimated to\u000a      be &#8364; 50million.[I] This partnership was strategic in giving\u000a      Chemtrix access to larger production units and ESK access to\u000a      the continuous flow reaction knowledge of Chemtrix.\u000a\u000a\u000aFigure 3.

In one\u000a      example, a new route for an API was identified at the lab-scale, resulting\u000a      in an increase in product\u000a      purity which upon transfer to the production plant led to significant cost\u000a      savings due to a reduction\u000a      in the complexity of the downstream separation process.

Professor Haswell, one\u000a      of these pioneers,\u000a      published the first micron-scale flow injection analysis system in 1995\u000a      and started to develop micro\u000a      reactor technology.1 This activity became instrumental in\u000a      securing a prestigious multi\u000a      university\/industry &#163;5 million Foresight LINK grant in 1999 that in turn\u000a      was used by the DTI (now\u000a      TSB) to establish a strategic national focus for the micro- and\u000a      nano-technology. The research of\u000a      Professor Haswell since 1993 has lead to over 180 peer reviewed\u000a      publications and 10 patents in\u000a      the field which have focused on establishing the fundamental design and\u000a      operational parameters of\u000a      flow reactors which gives the methodology significant advantages in the\u000a      fields of synthetic and\u000a      analytical chemistry.2-6 These advantages can be attributed to\u000a      the unique operating conditions\u000a      associated with meso\/micro flow-reactor devices in which the spatial and\u000a      temporal control of\u000a      reagents is achieved under a non-turbulent, diffusion limited mixing\u000a      regime. Within such systems\u000a      the control of hydrostatic and other pressure gradients, the\u000a      immobilization of catalysts (Pd, Pt,\u000a      sulphated zirconia, zeolites and enzymes) and the monitoring of reactants\u000a      and products have\u000a      featured strongly. A range of chemical reaction types have been carried\u000a      out to demonstrate the\u000a      advantages meso\/micro flow-reactors offer in terms of stereoselective\u000a      product control, multi-step\u000a      synthesis and in-situ separations. In addition, mathematical\u000a      models of reactions in meso\/micro\u000a      flow-reactors under electrokinetic and hydrodynamic control have been\u000a      successfully constructed\u000a      and validated using in-situ measurements of spatially and\u000a      temporally resolved concentration\u000a      profiles.\u000a    In 2002 a previous postdoctoral fellow of Professor Haswell, Dr Paul\u000a      Watts (Lecturer, University of\u000a      Hull; 2002 to 2013) and a former PhD student and postdoctoral researcher\u000a      Dr Charlotte Wiles\u000a      (PhD Student, University of Hull; 2000 to 2003 and post doctoral\u000a      researcher, University of Hull;\u000a      2003 to 2005) seized the opportunity to commercially develop the\u000a      underpinning research carried\u000a      out at Hull, focusing in particular on the up-scaling (volume increase) of\u000a      micro-reactor methodology\u000a      whilst retaining the inherent operational advantages of excellent reaction\u000a      control and efficiency. In\u000a      partnership with the University of Hull and Lionix, Chemtrix BV was\u000a      established to develop micro-reactor\u000a      based operating systems for industrial applications of flow chemistry.\u000a      Charlotte Wiles is\u000a      now the Chief Executive Officer with Chemtrix BV. The research carried out\u000a      at Hull in the field of\u000a      micro-reactors has therefore been instrumental in establishing the core\u000a      technology on which\u000a      Chemtrix has now developed innovative products that have lead to a\u000a      significant growth and\u000a      internationalisation of the business; with industrial customers in Europe,\u000a      UK, USA, Israel, India,\u000a      Taiwan, Korea, China and Australia.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28949","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The non-academic beneficiaries in terms of positive economic impacts from\u000a      the underpinning\u000a      research are Nalco &#8212; which has a successful and effective commercial\u000a      product line specifically\u000a      developed with the problem in mind, and its customers who use this product\u000a      (Clean n Cor). Clean\u000a      n Cor helps to decrease integrity risks by mitigating the potential for\u000a      under deposit corrosion in\u000a      production pipelines which has added benefits for the environment in\u000a      reducing the instances of\u000a      corrosion failures in high pressure lines and therefore ensuring a safer\u000a      working environment for\u000a      oilfield personnel.\u000a    Since 2008, Nalco has sold in excess of 17,000,000 kg of the product to\u000a      over 300 customers\u000a      including many of the super-major and major oil companies around the\u000a      world. In the 5 years since\u000a      2008, the Clean n Cor technology has been Nalco's fastest growing new\u000a      product. The success of\u000a      the original product has prompted several additional derivative products\u000a      utilizing the Clean n Cor\u000a      technology to address more specific niche applications.\u000a    Clean n Cor has been used extensively at over 300 oil production\u000a      locations worldwide, to impart\u000a      corrosion protection in aging production infrastructure and to maximize\u000a      water injectivity, with the\u000a      following economic and other benefits:\u000a    \u000a      Clean n Cor is injected into fluids at very low concentrations of the\u000a        active materials (40 - 100\u000a        ppm) which ensures the application is extremely cost-effective.\u000a      From a corrosion control perspective, the technology allows operating\u000a        companies to utilize\u000a        lower cost steel alloys for the fabrication of injection systems thereby\u000a        reducing capital costs\u000a        dramatically.\u000a      Clean n Cor also protects against corrosion from naturally occurring\u000a        microbes in the system,\u000a        minimising impact to the environment and protecting personnel in\u000a        oilfield operations. More\u000a        specifically Clean n Cor helps to minimize the deposition of solids\u000a        build up in the production\u000a        infrastructure and provides the protective film that mitigates\u000a        corrosion. Minimizing the effects of\u000a        corrosion results in less failures, and ultimately safer working\u000a        conditions for employees.\u000a      Oil companies often operate in environmentally sensitive areas and the\u000a        improvement in\u000a        corrosion protection will ensure the potential for pipeline failures and\u000a        the resulting exposure of\u000a        production fluids into the environment is minimized. This in turn\u000a        assists oil and gas companies\u000a        in preserving their licence to operate and protecting their corporate\u000a        brand.\u000a      Maximizing water injectivity has a dramatic impact on increasing oil\u000a        and gas production and this\u000a        is critical today as the global demand for oil and gas approaches the\u000a        global supply curve. By\u000a        cleaning the hydrocarbon based deposits that build up in injection\u000a        systems, the injection\u000a        differential pressure into the formation is reduced therefore allowing\u000a        more water to be injected to\u000a        balance crude oil production and ensure reservoir production pressure is\u000a        maximized. This has\u000a        resulted in increases of oil production that ranges between 50 - 100%.\u000a      Clean n Cor also minimizes operational costs that otherwise would be\u000a        incurred through having\u000a        to clean out injection wells as they start to plug up over time. This is\u000a        not only a savings in\u000a        operational cost, but also a safety advantage. The cleaning process\u000a        involves the use of heavy\u000a        machinery and employees operating on highly pressurized flow lines.\u000a        Clean n Cor helps to keep\u000a        the pipes clean chemically as opposed to manually.\u000a\u0009\u0009\u000a      To date, there are no other competing technologies to Clean n Cor in\u000a        the oilfield market place.\u000a      Although commercial sensitivity limits the range of specific impact\u000a        details that can be given here,\u000a        however the significance of this development and the important role\u000a        played by Hull researchers\u000a        was marked by the presentation by Nalco of a plaque to the Department of\u000a        Chemistry, University of\u000a        Hull in December 2011.

Injected into piped liquids, they work by adsorbing at\u000a      the aqueous solution-\u000a      corroding metal surface where they commonly reduce the corrosion rate by\u000a      &gt;95%, thereby saving\u000a      cost\/environmental impact. However, their performance over time\u000a      deteriorates due to the\u000a      accumulation of oily deposits mixed with clays, corrosion products and\u000a      biomass (so-called\u000a      \"schmoo\") at the metal surface. The accumulation of schmoo on internal\u000a      pipe surfaces not only\u000a      prevents the corrosion inhibitor reaching the metal surface but also\u000a      adversely affects water\u000a      injectivity (e.g. by reducing the effective internal diameter of a pipe)\u000a      and thereby causes problems\u000a      with many oilfield operations.\u000a    The key research from Hull underpinning Clean n Cor development was in\u000a      several stages. The first\u000a      stage was to realise that the behaviour of surfactant-like corrosion\u000a      inhibitor-schmoo-water systems\u000a      follows the patterns of microemulsion phase behaviour of conventional\u000a      surfactant-oil-water\u000a      systems enabled the exploitation of Hull's leading work in this area.\u000a      Early work (published pre-1993\u000a      and so not included here) at Hull had significantly advanced the\u000a      understanding of how oil\u000a      solubilisation can be maximised and how the oil-water tension can be made\u000a      ultra-low by \"tuning\"\u000a      the tendency of the adsorbed surfactant monolayer to curve &#8212; both factors\u000a      are of critical\u000a      importance in maximising schmoo removal from corroding metal surfaces.\u000a    Secondly, the post-1993 research that underpinned the development of\u000a      Clean n Cor1-4 investigated\u000a      the inter-relationships between the solid-oil, solid-water and oil-water\u000a      interfacial tensions to\u000a      understand the surface chemistry relating to the removal of oil from\u000a      capillaries and the adhesion of\u000a      different materials to solid surfaces. It identified the key factors\u000a      responsible for the adhesion of the\u000a      schmoo to the metal surface and how they could be manipulated, using the\u000a      understanding of\u000a      microemulsion behaviour, to ensure good removal. The research described in\u000a      Ref. 5 then\u000a      developed a laboratory-based schmoo removal test cell which (i) enabled\u000a      validation of the\u000a      fundamental concepts described above and (ii) showed excellent correlation\u000a      with in-field\u000a      performance of the multifunctional inhibitor systems. It was used to\u000a      provide a rapid screening of\u000a      different complex formulations and thereby enable the product launch of\u000a      the optimised Clean n Cor\u000a      system.\u000a    Thirdly, although very successful in most oilfield application sites, it\u000a      emerged that Clean n Cor was\u000a      not sufficiently effective against the schmoos formed in some particular\u000a      oilfields and Nalco\u000a      commissioned further research at Hull in 2012-13 to investigate. The Hull\u000a      team successfully\u000a      showed that schmoo from the problem sites contained additional solid\u000a      components which caused\u000a      the main removal mechanism to switch from \"roll-up\" and emulsification (as\u000a      seen in 5) to one of\u000a      solubilisation. Additional principles governing the design of Clean n Cor\u000a      formulations for such\u000a      problem sites were established and experiments demonstrated the enhanced\u000a      performance of new\u000a      formulation.

Line trials have been carried out with TATA and\u000a      Dyesol (Shotton) using their &#163;1.5M roll-to-roll pilot line.[5.1-5.4]\u000a      Holliman's group are scaling ultra-fast DSC sensitization, increasing DSC\u000a      efficiencies (by 30-40%) by improving spectral response using four dyes in\u000a      minutes. This avoids longer processing and large dye baths containing\u000a      100's g of expensive dye (ca. &#163;500\/g). Following the launch of the\u000a      SPECIFIC IKC (2011) Bangor has linked with Swansea partners to develop\u000a      building-integrated modules (roof mounted, windows etc.).[5.4-5.6] This\u000a      is important because roll-to-roll lines run at the speed of the slowest\u000a      process, so doubling dyeing time halves productivity making ultra-fast\u000a      sensitization essential for roll-to-roll DSC manufacture.\u000a    Since 2008, in addition to the six industry-facing PDRAs at Bangor, three\u000a      new jobs were created at the joint TATA\/Dyesol PV Accelerator in Shotton,\u000a      employing ex-Bangor researchers Rugen- Hankey, Vaca Velasco and\u000a      Ketipearachchi. Holliman is Bangor PI on an Industry\/Welsh\u000a      Government\/TSB\/EPSRC funded Innovation Knowledge Centre opened at Swansea\u000a      University in 2011 (SPECIFIC).[5.5-5.6] SPECIFIC works at\u000a      Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 3-7 on \"Buildings as Power Stations\" to\u000a      functionalise the building envelope. Hence, SPECIFIC is an exploitation\u000a      vehicle between invention (TRL1-3) and commercialisation (TRL 6-9).\u000a      Scaling and line trials of Bangor-generated IP (working with TATA, Dyesol,\u000a      G24i and\/or SPECIFIC) have taken the sintering and dyeing inventions from\u000a      TRL1-3 to TRL 4-5 using large substrates (A4 size) which are larger than\u000a      that required for fully scaling this technology into modules (see\u000a      Technology Roadmap below).\u000a    Another example of an impact of Bangor's research is WG-supported STRIP\u000a      initiative (Steel Training Research and Innovation Partnership) to deliver\u000a      high quality University research to industry to improve industry\u000a      competitiveness.[5.8]\u000a    Holliman has undertaken two funded secondments (Oct-Dec 2011 and July\u000a      2012-Jan 2013) to work with senior TATA and SPECIFIC management and\u000a      economists (Mr. Kevin Bygate and Mr. Kian Woodward, TATA and Prof. Dave\u000a      Worsley, SPECIFIC) on a PV Technology Roadmap (TRM). [5.1]\u000a      These were based at TATA (Shotton) and SPECIFIC (Swansea) and involved\u000a      visits to TATA sites in the UK and India and SPECIFIC partners (e.g.\u000a      NSG). The roadmap is a strategy for PV commercialisation which compares PV\u000a      technologies in terms of feasibility, manufacturing, processing and\u000a      lifetime issues as well as current\/predicted markets and product form. It\u000a      has been developed through SPECIFIC and its industrial partners (e.g.\u000a      TATA, NSG, BASF who have staff seconded into the centre) and the recently\u000a      Welsh Government-funded Ser Cymru Solar project (&#163;6M, 2013-2018) working\u000a      between Swansea, Imperial College and Bangor.\u000a    Thus, the research carried out at the School of Chemistry in Bangor has\u000a      been contributing to the evolving global PV sector through the development\u000a      of scaled PV manufacturing by accelerating dye sensitization by ca.\u000a      2000 times (24h becoming 1 min) and reducing processing temperatures (from\u000a      450-550&#176;C to room temperature). We have scaled these inventions to A4 size\u000a      and carried out feasibility and lifetime testing with G24i, Dyesol and\u000a      TATA and line trials with Tata\/Dyesol proving low temperature processes\u000a      can also take place much faster (30 min becoming 4 min). These process are\u000a      now being utilised by our industrial partners.[5.1]\u000a    Holliman has established a strong partnership with TATA Steel (scaling,\u000a      route to market) and Prof Worsley (SPECIFIC- rapid processing, lifetime\u000a      testing) working on PV commercialisation particularly that based on the\u000a      results of his research on DSC. Holliman has developed a Technology\u000a      Roadmap for PV[5.1] which sets the strategy\/targets to develop\u000a      scaled building integrated PV (BIPV) to replace bolt-on crystalline\u000a      silicon modules. TATA have already produced BIPV roofs based on this\u000a      strategy which are undergoing outdoor testing.[5.8]\u000a    Associated with this research, using EPSRC support (Holliman, 2008-2010),\u000a      the bilingual English- Welsh language schools lecture Chemistry Show-Sioe\u000a      Cemeg was presented to over 2000 children annually by Dr Robyn\u000a      Wheldon-Williams.[5.9] In 2013, Dr Matthew Davies (SPECIFIC\u000a      PDRA in Dr Holliman's group) led a 15 strong team to South Africa showing\u000a      how to make dye- sensitized solar cells from natural dyes to over 1300\u000a      school children over a 2-week visit.[5.9]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In 2012, it is estimated the $145bn was invested in solar photovoltaic\u000a      technology.

In October 2008\u000a      this sustained\u000a      release formulation of the synthetic hGH somatropin successfully completed\u000a      preclinical studies in\u000a      non-human primates, confirming that CriticalMix TM enables\u000a      sustained release of active species &#8212; as\u000a      predicted &#8212; and that the therapeutic plasma levels are maintained for\u000a      days, weeks or even\u000a      months following a single injection [5.1- 5.3].\u000a    Given the inherent shortcomings of the conventional hGH treatment\u000a      regimen, these results are\u000a      highly significant. hGH is used therapeutically to treat a variety of\u000a      diseases &#8212; from growth hormone\u000a      deficiency in children and adults to Turners Syndrome and HARS, a syndrome\u000a      associated with HIV\u000a      infection &#8212; but, due to various physical and biological barriers, it needs\u000a      to be injected\u000a      subcutaneously every day. The regimen is strongly disliked by patients and\u000a      carers, with studies\u000a      showing up to 66% of the former do not adhere to the prescribed routine,\u000a      leading to reduced\u000a      efficacy and increased healthcare costs. CP016 needs to be injected only\u000a      once every two weeks,\u000a      improving clinical outcomes through enhanced efficacy, greater patient\u000a      compliance and reduced\u000a      side-effects. A Non-Executive director of CP noted \"despite the marked\u000a      improvements in needle\u000a      and injector pen technology, there remains a sizeable number of patients\u000a      who have \"needle\u000a      phobia\" and fail to adhere to the prescribed regimen\" and that the\u000a      technology \"would be an\u000a      important addition to the clinician's armamentarium\" [5.4].\u000a    CP is also engaged in several new projects to increase the utility of\u000a      CriticalMix TM including\u000a      collaboration with UK biotechnology company PolyTherics Ltd. This\u000a      partnership, launched in 2011\u000a      and backed by &#163;350k of Technology Strategy Board funding [5.4], was\u000a      initiated to produce a\u000a      clinically superior sustained release product that could be administered\u000a      less frequently than\u000a      currently marketed products, resulting in reduced side-effects and\u000a      improved overall efficacy. The\u000a      Chief Executive Officer of PolyTherics has described the collaboration as\u000a      \"an opportunity to\u000a      develop a unique technology... to produce a better product for patients\"\u000a      [5.5]. In addition in a\u000a      collaboration with Ferring Pharmaceuticals which began in 2011, from\u000a      pre-clinical results,\u000a      CriticalMixTM technology has been shown to \"overcome issues of\u000a      release of Ferring's molecule\u000a      which could not be overcome using standard drug delivery\" [5.6]. Both of\u000a      these examples\u000a      demonstrate the significant impact CriticalMix TM has for\u000a      patients.\u000a    Working with the UoN research team, CP has developed a second proprietary\u000a      technology,\u000a      CriticalSorb TM, which allows hGH and other drugs to be\u000a      administered using a nasal spray.\u000a      CriticalSorb TM is a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient\u000a      approved by the Food and Drug\u000a      Administration as GRAS (\"generally regarded as safe\"). It has a Drug\u000a      Master File and is used in\u000a      currently marketed products as a solubility enhancer for intravenous and\u000a      oral administration. It was\u000a      found to be non-toxic in preclinical toxicology studies and was well\u000a      tolerated by the nasal mucosa\u000a      in acute, 14-day and six-month repeated dose chronic toxicity studies. It\u000a      is not mutagenic to\u000a      bacteria, mammalian cells and mammals, and no developmental toxicity or\u000a      teratogenicity has been\u000a      found. hGH could previously not be absorbed through the nasal mucosa, but\u000a      CriticalSorb TM has\u000a      been shown to allow it to be administered intra-nasally &#8212; thereby\u000a      completely removing the need for\u000a      daily injections.\u000a    CriticalSorb TM nderpinned the development of the hGH\u000a      treatment CP024, which in July 2012\u000a      successfully completed Phase I clinical trials in which it exhibited\u000a      similar performance and safety to\u000a      marketed products [5.7]. The trials also showed CP024 to be the first\u000a      intra-nasal growth hormone\u000a      to induce the insulin-like growth factor IGF-1. This represents a\u000a      significant advance in efforts to\u000a      treat the disorders related to hGH deficiency outlined above while\u000a      obviating the need for injections.\u000a      The growth hormone market is currently worth $3.1bn, with more than 10\u000a      major manufacturers of\u000a      branded and generic daily injectable products. CP024 is the only\u000a      non-invasive growth hormone\u000a      product in development, and feedback from leading endocrinologists and\u000a      franchise holders\u000a      indicates it is an attractive product for patients and physicians.\u000a    CriticalSorb TM has also been used in two revenue-generating\u000a      research collaborations with\u000a      biotechnology companies and in a major collaborative project with\u000a      Nottingham's Queen's Medical\u000a      Centre, the largest hospital in the UK and Europe's largest teaching\u000a      hospital, to evaluate a new\u000a      nasal delivery formulation for Teriparatide, a treatment for osteoporosis\u000a      [5.8]. This new formulation\u000a      is expected to improve the efficacy of the drug and make it more easily\u000a      administered as it\u000a      eliminates the current need for daily subcutaneous injection. To date the\u000a      collaboration has\u000a      demonstrated excellent outcomes in preclinical studies and will start\u000a      Phase I clinical trials in\u000a      October 2013. The Head of The Clinical Gerontology Research Unit at\u000a      Nottingham University\u000a    Hospitals NHS Trust [5.9] expects the nasal teriparatide product to\u000a      `significantly benefit patients,\u000a      their families, carers and clinicians with improved clinical outcomes and\u000a      greatly enhanced ease of\u000a      use' and `enable patients to live independently for longer so reducing the\u000a      cost of treatment'.\u000a      The progress made in exploiting these technologies is in line with the\u000a      drug discovery and\u000a      development timeline expected when bringing a new drug\/therapy to market &#8212;\u000a      specifically, up to 15\u000a      years from inception.\u000a    UoN's research has enabled CP to safeguard nine jobs and has also allowed\u000a      expansion, with a\u000a      further six staff recruited since 2008. In the period 2008-2013, CP has\u000a      attracted &#163;2.7m in private\u000a      investment and venture capital and another &#163;1.9m in R&amp;D funding,\u000a      including &#163;1.5m from the\u000a      Wellcome Trust (October 2009) [5.10] to develop CriticalSorb TM.\u000a      Investors have described CP as\u000a      \"an exciting opportunity\" and \"an ideal showcase for the region's\u000a      excellence in pharmaceutical\u000a      services\" [5.11]. A number of revenue-generating research collaborations\u000a      have been secured using\u000a      the CriticalMixTM technology, including with a leading\u000a      European pharmaceutical company, seven\u000a      biopharmaceutical companies and two drug-delivery companies.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The University of Nottingham's School of Chemistry has developed a novel\u000a      method of\u000a      incorporating thermally or chemically labile biologically active\u000a      substances into polymers.

In particular, maintaining the structure and activity of\u000a      biological materials within\u000a      polymers using conventional processing methods &#8212; for example,\u000a      organic\/aqueous solvent\u000a      interfaces, elevated temperatures or the mechanical agitation of solutions\u000a      &#8212; is difficult. In 1996,\u000a      after a study of the literature (including the foaming and processing of\u000a      polymers in tissue\u000a      engineering) highlighted areas in which improvements in bio-materials\u000a      processing were needed,\u000a      the School of Chemistry at the University of Nottingham (UoN) began\u000a      investigating the application\u000a      of supercritical fluids for incorporating thermally or chemically labile\u000a      biologically active substances\u000a      into polymers.\u000a    Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is known to be a \"green\"\u000a      solvent with a broad range of\u000a      environmentally sustainable chemistry applications. Working in\u000a      collaboration with Vladimir Popov,\u000a      of Moscow's Russian Academy of Sciences, Professor Steven Howdle\u000a      (Professor of Chemistry,\u000a      1989-present) discovered that scCO2 plasticises polymers and\u000a      can be used not only to generate\u000a      porous scaffolds but also to incorporate thermally labile molecules\u000a      without loss of their activity.\u000a      Examples included growth hormone yielding polymeric materials suitable for\u000a      tissue engineering\u000a      applications in the field of bone repair. This finding is the subject of a\u000a      patent application [3.i] filed by\u000a      UoN.\u000a    The researchers showed that the use of this supercritical fluid mixing\u000a      method for producing a\u000a      sustained release formulation had considerable advantage over existing\u000a      commercial technologies\u000a      as the drug is not chemically modified during the process. As a result\u000a      there are no changes in\u000a      activity, stability, safety and distribution of the active ingredients.\u000a      Moreover, the process of\u000a      encapsulation operates at ambient temperatures meaning that the technique\u000a      could be applied to a\u000a      range of thermally sensitive molecule such as proteins. The process is\u000a      also solvent-free so there\u000a      is no possibility of solvent residues contaminating the formulations and\u000a      causing potentially harmful\u000a      side-effects in patients.\u000a    The key finding that polymer-drug scaffolds could be formed using scCO2\u000a      and without using any\u000a      hazardous chemical solvents\/reagents made the technology immediately\u000a      amenable to biomedical\u000a      applications. Howdle collaborated with UoN's School of Pharmacy (Professor\u000a      Kevin Shakesheff,\u000a      Professor of Advanced Drug Delivery and Tissue Engineering, 1997-present;\u000a      Professor Martyn\u000a      Davies, Professor of Biomedical Surface Chemistry, 1985-present) to\u000a      explore these possibilities\u000a      further and secured an EPSRC Materials Processing for Engineering\u000a      Applications grant (MaPEA)\u000a      [3.a] to investigate scale-up and commercialisation. This research\u000a      included the optimisation of the\u000a      supercritical mixing method and the testing of new polymer scaffolds for\u000a      tissue engineering [3.1-\u000a      3.3].\u000a    It was found that proteins could be mixed with plasticised polymers under\u000a      scCO2 conditions and\u000a      the mixture sprayed to produce polymeric microparticles loaded with active\u000a      protein. This could then\u000a      be injected and would deliver the biologically active substance in a\u000a      controlled release manner.\u000a      Protein activity was also found to be unaffected by the supercritical\u000a      mixing process [3.1]. A process\u000a      was subsequently developed to allow encapsulation of delicate\u000a      protein-based drugs or hormones\u000a      into a biodegradable polymeric matrix, either as a scaffold for tissue\u000a      engineering applications or as\u000a      microparticles for controlled drug release.\u000a    The MaPEA research highlighted the commercial potential of using\u000a      supercritical fluids as a reaction\u000a      medium for the manufacture of polymer-based biomaterials.

Held in Ethiopia, each has\u000d\u000a      attracted up to 100 high\u000d\u000a      school\/university students, chemists, chemical engineers from Ethiopian\u000d\u000a      industry and members of\u000d\u000a      the general public. Researchers from Poliakoff and Licence's team have\u000d\u000a      given talks on their work &#8212; including\u000d\u000a      research into ionic liquids, reaction optimisation and hydrogenation using\u000d\u000a      supercritical\u000d\u000a      fluids &#8212; and have held discussions with students to share experiences.\u000d\u000a      According to AAU's Dr\u000d\u000a      Nigist Asfaw, these events have been fundamental in raising Green\u000d\u000a      Chemistry's wider profile, even\u000d\u000a      featuring on Ethiopian national television and in the national print\u000d\u000a      media. Asfaw has remarked: \"It\u000d\u000a      has been great to see Green Chemistry, which was once an unknown topic in\u000d\u000a      our country, being\u000d\u000a      discussed and employed across my country.\" [5.2]\u000d\u000a    Building on the success of the initial research collaboration and the\u000d\u000a      subsequent workshops, a\u000d\u000a      British Council DelPHE-funded partnership between AAU's Science Faculty\u000d\u000a      and UoN's School of\u000d\u000a      Chemistry was secured. Showcased as a DelPHE case study in 2010 [5.3], the\u000d\u000a      arrangement has\u000d\u000a      continued to deliver benefits throughout the impact period. Knowledge\u000d\u000a      transfer between the two\u000d\u000a      universities, coupled with Licence's appointment as an Adjunct Professor\u000d\u000a      at AAU, has resulted in a\u000d\u000a      new course, Introduction to Green Chemistry, for the undergraduate\u000d\u000a      curriculum. In addition, PhD\u000d\u000a      students trained by Poliakoff and Licence have taken up positions at other\u000d\u000a      Ethiopian universities,\u000d\u000a      including Jimma, Haramaya, Hawassa and Bahir Dar, where they are now\u000d\u000a      promoting and initiating\u000d\u000a      Green Chemistry research. Licence has also hosted four visiting\u000d\u000a      researchers in Nottingham as part of\u000d\u000a      their PhD studies in Ethiopia. In 2013 the British Council's Director of\u000d\u000a      Science observed: \"A little\u000d\u000a      over a decade ago the field of Green Chemistry was virtually unknown in\u000d\u000a      Ethiopia. Now, as a direct\u000d\u000a      result of the University of Nottingham's pioneering efforts, it is taught\u000d\u000a      across the country. We\u000d\u000a      consider this to be one of our most successful recent DelPHE projects.\u000d\u000a      Your work... has given\u000d\u000a      Ethiopian chemists a sense of empowerment and confidence.\" [5.4]\u000d\u000a    In 2012 the Ethiopian Ministry of Education and UoN reached an agreement\u000d\u000a      for jointly funded\u000d\u000a      scholarships for outstanding young Ethiopian academics to undertake\u000d\u000a      one-year research\u000d\u000a      programmes at UoN in areas likely to advance the country's development.\u000d\u000a      Green Chemistry is one\u000d\u000a      of these areas. In an August 2013 letter to Poliakoff &#8212; who twice met with\u000d\u000a      Ethiopia's Deputy Prime\u000d\u000a      Minister, His Excellency Derek Mekonnen, in 2011 &#8212; the Ethiopian\u000d\u000a      Ambassador to the UK said:\u000d\u000a      \"His Excellency was most impressed to hear how the ideas of Green\u000d\u000a      Chemistry are being\u000d\u000a      incorporated into the curriculum at AAU and other universities... [He] and\u000d\u000a      I would like to thank you\u000d\u000a      and your colleagues for your great efforts over nearly 10 years in\u000d\u000a      increasing the understanding of\u000d\u000a      science and science education in my country.\" [5.5]\u000d\u000a    The influence of UoN's work has also been felt beyond Ethiopia. As a\u000d\u000a      result of his connections with\u000d\u000a      Nottingham, Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) President Simon Campbell\u000d\u000a      attended the inaugural\u000d\u000a      Federation of African Societies of Chemistry (FASC) congress in 2006,\u000d\u000a      where he announced RSC\u000d\u000a      would be the first learned and professional organisation to provide\u000d\u000a      developing countries with free\u000d\u000a      access to science journal archives. The current RSC Chief Executive has\u000d\u000a      described UoN's input as\u000d\u000a      \"critical\" to this move, noting: \"Your work has transformed how the\u000d\u000a      concept of Green Chemistry is\u000d\u000a      perceived and pursued in Africa.\" [5.6] Between 2008 and 2013 more than\u000d\u000a      49,000 journal articles\u000d\u000a      have been downloaded and 25,000 textbooks and RSC journals distributed to\u000d\u000a      universities in 12\u000d\u000a      different African countries &#8212; including 800 to aid the reconstruction of\u000d\u000a      Liberia University &#8212; under the\u000d\u000a      Journals for Africa initiative.\u000d\u000a    The success of the collaboration between FASC and RSC led to the\u000d\u000a      formation of the Pan-African\u000d\u000a      Chemistry Network (PACN), including the establishment in 2008 of two hubs\u000d\u000a      &#8212; one in Addis Ababa.\u000d\u000a      PACN aims to enhance cooperation between governments, universities,\u000d\u000a      industry and communities\u000d\u000a      to help build a sustainable science base across the continent. The RSC's\u000d\u000a      CEO has acknowledged\u000d\u000a      UoN's \"significant input\" into PACN [5.6], including its contribution to\u000d\u000a      Wealth Not Waste: Green\u000d\u000a      Science and Engineering for Sustainable Growth in Africa [5.7], a report\u000d\u000a      whose cover featured\u000d\u000a      Poliakoff's Thirteen Principles for Green Chemistry for Africa. According\u000d\u000a      to RSC, Wealth Not Waste\u000d\u000a      has reached an estimated 20,000 scientists and 2,500 global policymakers\u000d\u000a      since its launch at\u000d\u000a      launch at the United Nations UNECA CODIST-2 meeting. Further UoN support\u000d\u000a      for PACN has\u000d\u000a      included Licence's participation on the PACN Advisory Board since 2009. He\u000d\u000a      has also lectured at\u000d\u000a      the PACN Sustainable Water Conference, University of Nairobi (August\u000d\u000a      2009), been a member of\u000d\u000a      the organising committee for the 1st PACN Green Chemistry Congress\u000d\u000a      (November 2010) held in\u000d\u000a      Addis Ababa and sat on the organising group of PACN, Nigeria &#8212; Health\u000d\u000a      Water and Waste, Lagos\u000d\u000a      (July 2012). These interactions have seen Green Chemistry research feature\u000d\u000a      at the heart of PACN\u000d\u000a      activities further raising awareness of the topic across Africa.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    University of Nottingham researchers have been at the forefront in\u000d\u000a      promoting and establishing\u000d\u000a      Green Chemistry in developing nations. Working with and influencing\u000d\u000a      colleagues and policymakers\u000d\u000a      in both the UK and Africa, they have increased awareness of the importance\u000d\u000a      of introducing\u000d\u000a      sustainable technologies that meet local communities' needs. As a result,\u000d\u000a      they have invigorated\u000d\u000a      the chemistry teaching curriculum in Ethiopia, placing Green Chemistry at\u000d\u000a      its core, and helped\u000d\u000a      shape the approaches of professional bodies, including the Royal Society\u000d\u000a      of Chemistry, for the\u000d\u000a      benefit of the developing world.

The\u000d\u000a      sustainable, low-energy methods used in this study, which was published in\u000d\u000a      2005, were shown to\u000d\u000a      extract the essential oils rapidly, reducing energy costs and resulting in\u000d\u000a      differing compositions that\u000d\u000a      could subsequently lead to the discovery of biologically interesting\u000d\u000a      molecules.\u000d\u000a    Continued collaboration between Licence and Asfaw investigated the use of\u000d\u000a      the seed oil of the\u000d\u000a      Ethiopian indigenous plant Moringa stenopetala as biodiesel [3.6].\u000d\u000a      These two publications\u000d\u000a      highlighted the impact Green Chemistry could have in Ethiopia &#8212; in doing\u000d\u000a      so laying the foundations\u000d\u000a      for a wider appreciation of the School's other work in this vital field.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31280","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Since 2008 the University of Nottingham's School of Chemistry has\u000a      undertaken a sustained\u000a      programme of public engagement, both through face to face events and via\u000a      the internet, to\u000a      communicate its world-leading research in nanoscience and materials for\u000a      energy applications. The\u000a      team has been motivated by a desire to enable the public to debate\u000a      scientific issues of societal\u000a      importance, enthuse a sufficient number of school pupils to pursue careers\u000a      in science and\u000a      engineering to sustain our national infrastructure in the future and to\u000a      communicate new discoveries\u000a      for their inherent excitement.\u000a    The School's innovative use of online media has enabled it to share its\u000a      research with a global\u000a      audience via our award-winning YouTube channel, \"The Periodic Table of\u000a      Videos\" (PTOV) [5.1].\u000a      (www.periodicvideos.com). The\u000a      PTOV team is led by Professor Martyn Poliakoff CBE, FRS\u000a      (Research Professor of Chemistry, 1979-present), in collaboration with Dr\u000a      Samantha Tang (Public\u000a      Awareness scientist 2004-present) and journalist Brady Haran. It is one of\u000a      the most popular\u000a      chemistry focused sites on the internet, with greater than 325,000\u000a      subscribers and 47.5 million\u000a      views and for this work Poliakoff was recognised with the 2011 Royal\u000a      Society of Chemistry Nyholm\u000a      Prize for Education. This ground-breaking project has earned critical\u000a      acclaim and a wealth of\u000a      positive feedback has been recognised by awards from IChemE, Science (Science,\u000a      2011, 332,\u000a      1046) and a prestigious US Webby Award in 2012. In the 2009 International\u000a      Review of UK\u000a      Chemistry Research \"Chemistry for the next decade and beyond\" it was\u000a      highlighted that by using\u000a      PTOV to communicate science to school age students \"such an approach to\u000a      community outreach\u000a      was extremely cost effective, reaching more than a thousand individuals\u000a      per pound invested\" [5.2].\u000a      We have regularly used this medium to communicate the School's research\u000a      with about a quarter of\u000a      the research staff contributing to the production of scientific videos.\u000a      The research topics on\u000a      `nanoscience' and `materials for energy applications' feature in some of\u000a      the series' highly popular\u000a      entries alongside videos that describe e.g. research into chemical\u000a      knots, X-ray photon\u000a      spectroscopy of ionic liquids and self-optimised reactions.\u000a    Using the PTOV platform, Liddle has communicated his work on uranium\u000a      [3.6] through the videos\u000a      `New Uranium Bond' (60,000+ views) and `Magnetic Uranium' (105,000+).\u000a      These build on an\u000a      earlier clip, `Uranium' (399,000+), in which he describes the element's\u000a      general properties and\u000a      dispels some of the misconceptions surrounding it. Other videos feature\u000a      Khlobystov's work with\u000a      C60 (`Buckyballs'; 70,000+) and graphene (`Graphene'; 44,000+) whilst the\u000a      use of scandium-based\u000a      metal organic frameworks for hydrogen storage [3.5] is included in a video\u000a      about Scandium\u000a      (107,000+). The original `Uranium' video is one of 34 PTOV films used in\u000a      products supplied by\u000a      Pearson to support GCSE-level chemistry in around 600 schools in the UK.\u000a      Pearson UK's Senior\u000a      Manager (Science) has confirmed the \"very positive feedback\" generated by\u000a      PTOV, remarking:\u000a      \"[Its] use added to the educational value and engagement for students.\"\u000a      [5.3]\u000a    The School of Chemistry team continually evaluate their outreach\u000a      activities and a study of 179\u000a      teachers and 229 students by Dr Andrew Clapham (UoN Department of\u000a      Education) further\u000a      highlighted PTOV's educational benefits [5.4]. The independent study noted\u000a      that 77% of students\u000a      associated uranium with nuclear energy before watching Liddle's New\u000a      Uranium Bond video,\u000a      whereas afterwards 84% associated uranium with chemical bonds. Some 80% of\u000a      students said the\u000a      video had changed their understanding of uranium and related research.\u000a      Similarly a study of\u000a      teacher's use of PTOV showed more than 70% of those questioned used it in\u000a      lessons. Interviews\u000a      and focus group data suggested it influenced teachers' subject content\u000a      knowledge (89%) and\u000a      pedagogical content knowledge (42%). Clapham observed: \"PTOV impacted both\u000a      on how teachers\u000a      taught and, crucially, their own fundamental conceptions of nanoscience\u000a      and materials.\"\u000a    In 2008, the School's research into metal organic frameworks [3.4] and\u000a      nanotubes [3.1] was\u000a      presented to thousands of visitors at the NanoWhat? Totally Tiny\u000a      Technology exhibition. This\u000a      event, organised by the East Midlands Development Agency (EMDA), ran for\u000a      17 days in\u000a      Nottingham, Leicester, Loughborough, Derby, Lincoln and Northampton. More\u000a      than 24,000 people\u000a      - including nearly 1,300 pupils, most aged 11 to 13, from 40 schools -\u000a      attended. Each schoolchild\u000a      was engaged for an estimated six hours, including follow-up work with a\u000a      special activity pack. An\u000a      independent study [5.5] concluded the event \"fully met the targets defined\u000a      by EMDA and\u000a      significantly exceeded the estimates for public participation... [and]\u000a      served as a valuable curriculum\u000a      enrichment opportunity for the schools that attended\". Several\u000a      accompanying short films, including\u000a      one in which Champness discussed his and Schr&#246;der's work on new materials\u000a      for hydrogen\u000a      storage, were shown to visitors and at participating schools and later won\u000a      the Best Corporate\/Non-\u000a      Broadcast Programme prize at the Royal Television Society Midland Awards\u000a      [5.6].\u000a    `Wonder in Carbon Land', an exhibit designed to communicate the School's\u000a      development of\u000a      nanotubes [3.1, 3.2], used interactive displays to convey both simple\u000a      concepts (e.g. bonding\u000a      between atoms) and complex ideas (e.g. the laws of quantum mechanics) to a\u000a      range of audiences.\u000a      It debuted at the 2008 Royal Society Summer Exhibition (RSSE), which\u000a      attracted 4,323 attendees,\u000a      including 894 schoolchildren. Feedback compiled by the Royal Society [5.7]\u000a      showed 86% of adult\u000a      visitors felt their interest in science increased as a result of the\u000a      exhibition, while 62% of school\u000a      pupils said the experience made them more interested in a career in\u000a      science. The EPSRC's then\u000a      Public Engagement Manager subsequently invited the School to exhibit\u000a      `Wonder in Carbon Land'\u000a      at the 2008 British Science Festival, noting: \"Your department is highly\u000a      successful in terms of\u000a      EPSRC-funded research and public engagement.\" [5.8] Almost 29,000 people,\u000a      3,755 of them\u000a      schoolchildren aged eight to 16, attended the event, with feedback [5.9]\u000a      indicating 88% rated the\u000a      exhibits \"excellent\" or \"good\" in terms of their ability to educate or\u000a      inform. In 2010 the EPSRC used\u000a      the exhibit again, this time at a showcase event for EPSRC staff.\u000a    At the 2012 RSSE Liddle presented `The Wonder of Chemistry', a series of\u000a      nine public lectures.\u000a      This allowed him to communicate his uranium research to a total audience\u000a      of around 750 people,\u000a      including more than 600 14-to-18-year-old students. Some 80% of attendees\u000a      said their knowledge\u000a      increased as a result [5.7]. A video of the lecture [5.10] was later\u000a      posted on the Royal Society\u000a      website to sustain public engagement. At the 2010 RSSE, which was attended\u000a      by almost 50,000\u000a      people, including more than 1,000 schoolchildren, the School's research\u000a      into novel hydrogen\u000a      storage materials [3.4] was part of the Diamond Light Source exhibit.\u000a    Champness's work on molecular networks [3.3] has also been a key\u000a      component of `Seeing the\u000a      Unseeable', a series of annual masterclasses to encourage students &#8212;\u000a      particularly those unable to\u000a      pursue higher education without support &#8212; to study science at degree\u000a      level. Since 2008, 134\u000a      students have attended; 48 have applied to attend the University of\u000a      Nottingham, with 13 enrolling.\u000a      Feedback from the past four years [5.11] shows 83% felt the programme\u000a      raised their interest in\u000a      science, with comments including \"It has encouraged me to go on to HE\" and\u000a      \"It has opened my\u000a      mind\".\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The School of Chemistry has a long track record of pioneering and\u000a      innovative outreach activities\u000a      aimed at stimulating public interest and understanding in chemistry\u000a      research and its societal\u000a      impact.

Their approach\u000a      reflects the recommendations\u000a      contained in Chapter 3 (Public Understanding of Science) of the Select\u000a      Committee on Science and\u000a      Technology's Third Report, published in 2000, which said: \"Grant-giving\u000a      bodies should give\u000a      researchers every encouragement to share their research with the public...\u000a      and should support and\u000a      reward those who do so.\" Comprising of Professor Neil Champness (now\u000a      Professor of Chemical\u000a      Nanoscience and Head of Inorganic and Materials Chemistry, 1995-present),\u000a      Professor Andrei\u000a      Khlobystov (now Professor of Nanomaterials, 2004-present), Professor\u000a      Martin Schr&#246;der (now\u000a      Dean of Science and Professor of Inorganic Chemistry, 1995-present) and\u000a      Professor Steve Liddle\u000a      (now Professor of Inorganic Chemistry, 2007-present), the team has\u000a      achieved a number of\u000a      scientific \"firsts\" that have underpinned its engagement efforts.\u000a    In 2005 Khlobystov developed the world's smallest test tube by using a\u000a      single-walled carbon\u000a      nanotube (SWNT) as a nano-sized reaction vessel. This technique allows the\u000a      synthesis of linear\u000a      polymers to be controlled and could find application in the synthesis of\u000a      industrially important\u000a      polymers such as polyethylene [3.1]. Two years later further research by\u000a      Khlobystov showed\u000a      fullerenes bearing organic groups could be encapsulated within a SWNT and\u000a      that the distance\u000a      between the C60 units could be controlled [3.2].\u000a    In work with important applications in areas such as magnetism and\u000a      sensing devices, Champness\u000a      and others discovered new methods for arranging molecules on surfaces. In\u000a      particular, they built a\u000a      molecular network on graphite surfaces and showed how a rhombus tiling\u000a      effect is created [3.3].\u000a      This work was first published in 2008.\u000a    The development of new porous materials by Schr&#246;der and Champness\u000a      resulted in the discovery\u000a      of a metal organic framework (MOF) with remarkable hydrogen storage\u000a      capacity and led to two\u000a      world-record values for such materials &#8212; the first in 2006 (7.5 wt%) and\u000a      the second in 2009 (10\u000a      wt%) [3.4]. These materials, the development of which generated\u000a      considerable publicity, including\u000a      leading articles in Science and Nature, exceed the US\u000a      Department of Energy's 2010 target for\u000a      hydrogen storage materials (6 wt%). More recent developments have looked\u000a      at the use of\u000a      scandium-based systems for hydrogen storage [3.5].\u000a    In 2012, after decades of failed international attempts, Liddle reported\u000a      the preparation and isolation\u000a      of a landmark molecular terminal uranium-nitride [3.6] - widely credited\u000a      by others as \"the ultimate\u000a      target in synthetic actinide chemistry\".

The market for biomedical stains is\u000a      relatively small compared to uses of dyes in textiles and cosmetics, often\u000a      leading to sharp fluctuations in cost and availability of key compounds5.5.\u000a    In the 1990s, CellPath Ltd, a small family business focussing on\u000a      laboratory supplies, such as plasticware, decided to seek assistance from\u000a      Bangor University chemistry researchers to advise on the development of\u000a      processes for the manufacture of high-quality laboratory stains, in\u000a      particular for the Pap test.\u000a    During a 3-year collaboration, funded by an EPSRC Teaching Company Scheme\u000a      Grant (later KTP)5.6, researchers from Bangor University under\u000a      the supervision of Professor Mark Baird developed a new approach to\u000a      compounds for the Pap test and other biomedical special stains. A new\u000a      process was also developed for the synthesis of the Light Green SF\u000a      Yellowish stain, which had become virtually unobtainable commercially3.3.\u000a      These Ortho Stains were more effective, economical and readily available\u000a      than existing formulations.

For example, it was found that the reaction temperature\u000a      for haematoxylin production could be lowered, saving 2.5% of total\u000a      production costs, while reduction in Alum concentration produced\u000a      additional efficiencies. A stabilized form of Haematoxylin was developed\u000a      for commercial scale production, as Haematoxylin Z, which remains on the\u000a      market.\u000a    The company invested &#163;170k in production facilities and hired two\u000a      production workers5.7.

The stain, which is itself a\u000a      mixture of four dyes and various ingredients, was developed with\u000a      apparently little rational design. Although certain dyes were chosen to\u000a      react with specific entities, e.g. with cell cytoplasm (collagens \/\u000a      keratins); two of the ingredients, Bismarck Brown Y and phosphotungstic\u000a      acid appear to interfere with each other.\u000a    During the late 1980s and early 1990s, a series of smear test\u000a      misdiagnoses were reported in the national press as a result of both the\u000a      approach, which was not suitable for automation, and human error in\u000a      misinterpreting cellular structures. Coincidentally, a worldwide shortage\u000a      in one of the key ingredients, Light Green SF Yellowish was reported. This\u000a      was largely due to the high costs of waste disposal as the dye itself was\u000a      a suspected carcinogen and its production involved lead oxide.\u000a    CellPath, innovators in cytological pathology based in Newtown, Mid Wales\u000a      were interested in:\u000a    i) Large scale synthesis of Light Green SF Yellowish\u000a    ii) Large scale synthesis of possible analogues, e.g. Fast Green\u000a      FCF used as a replacement in Masson's trichrome stain\u000a    iii) Rational design of Papanicolaou cytological stains using molecular\u000a      modelling\u000a    iv) Prediction of the UV-Vis spectra of known and novel cytological\u000a      stains using molecular modelling\u000a    v) Investigation of key stain-cell interactions using molecular modelling\u000a    Bangor University was well-placed to carry out this research, as a result\u000a      of Professor Mark Baird's expertise in synthetic organic chemistry and\u000a      structure determination, in particular, in relation to cyclopropanes and\u000a      cyclopropenes3.1, 3.2.\u000a    The company approached us because of our research experience in organic\u000a      synthesis, on the advice of the Welsh Development Agency. Synthetic work\u000a      including synthesis optimization was successfully carried out at both\u000a      Bangor and Cellpath by Dr. Jeremy Tomkinson, supported by an EPSRC\u000a      Teaching Company Scheme award and Simon Oram3.3, whose MSc\u000a      thesis was funded by Cellpath. Dr Tomkinson had worked on the synthesis of\u000a      aromatic systems for his PhD and was ideally suited to take on the\u000a      challenge of developing and improving synthesis of stains (containing\u000a      aromatic systems) for application in cervical cancer smears.\u000a    During this time much of the underpinning basic science was carried out\u000a      by R.A. Davies as part of his PhD, focussing on modelling of structures of\u000a      the stains. This work re-confirmed Dahne's triad theory for organic\u000a      chromophores, allowing dyes to be categorized with differing amounts of\u000a      polyenic, aromatic and polymethinic character. Linear regressions were\u000a      developed for the three families allowing accurate quantitative\u000a      predictions of the UV-VIS spectra of cytological dyes. Initial stain-cell\u000a      (e.g. haematoxylin-DNA) interactions used in both the cervical smear test\u000a      and other staining procedures such as the widely used Gram test for\u000a      bacteria, were modelled using smaller analogues.\u000a    In addition, as part of her PhD3.5, Ms A.O'Sullivan began a\u000a      programme modelling the structures of natural polymers- then a very\u000a      complex exercise -to understand the bonding of stains to such systems. Mr\u000a      Oram's work was nearer-market, carefully optimising reaction conditions\u000a      for appropriate commercial scales, with a view to the economics of\u000a      production.\u000a    Much of the work in these research theses was considered commercially\u000a      sensitive at the time, and therefore was not published in refereed\u000a      journals. Some of the modelling work of O'Sullivan was eventually\u000a      published in collaboration with Prof A. Whiting at Durham in 20083.6.\u000a    The modelling approaches devised in the PhD thesis are currently used by\u000a      the Davies research group, e.g. hydrogen bond containing polhydroxy\u000a      napthoquinone dyes (James Maskery, Knowledge Exchange Scholarship PhD in\u000a      collaboration with CAST Ltd).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31942","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research contributed directly to national and\u000d\u000a      international discussions and agreements on the phase-out of ozone\u000d\u000a      depleting gases.

The WMO assessment\u000d\u000a      reports (most recent 2010, published in 2011), and in particular their\u000d\u000a      summaries, have also been used internationally to monitor the success of\u000d\u000a      the Montreal Protocol in protecting the ozone layer and climate, for\u000d\u000a      example, by comparing the rate of halocarbon reduction with that observed,\u000d\u000a      and to inform the wider public about the process.\u000d\u000a    The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer came\u000d\u000a      into force in 1987, in response to the scientific evidence that\u000d\u000a      human-induced depletion of the ozone layer was indeed occurring. The\u000d\u000a      Protocol mandates that the measures it introduced must be regularly\u000d\u000a      assessed (now every 4 years) on the basis of available scientific,\u000d\u000a      environmental, technical, and economic information.

The original Montreal Protocol in 1987 called for\u000d\u000a      modest regulation on the emission of CFCs and allowed for on-going\u000d\u000a      revision based on scientific evidence. The 10 subsequent amendments and\u000d\u000a      adjustments to the Protocol, based on the Scientific Assessments, brought\u000d\u000a      about more rapid phase-out of the CFCs and also added new controls for\u000d\u000a      many more ozone-depleting compounds. The most recent adjustments were made\u000d\u000a      in 2007, were enacted in the following years and remain current (see below\u000d\u000a      for on-going EU legislation). The impact of these amendments and\u000d\u000a      adjustments (reduced ozone depletion) will be felt for many decades. Pyle\u000d\u000a      and Harris have worked to ensure their research has been widely reported\u000d\u000a      in the media since 2008, thereby contributing both to the public\u000d\u000a      understanding of the importance of climate change and the role of\u000d\u000a      environmental policy. 3,4,5,6,7&amp;8\u000d\u000a    On the basis of his significant research contribution, since 2008\u000d\u000a      Professor Pyle has been one of four international Co-Chairs of the Science\u000d\u000a      Assessment Panel (SAP), who provide direct advice to the Meetings of the\u000d\u000a      Parties to the Montreal Protocol1. By undertaking these roles,\u000d\u000a      it has been possible to ensure that the group's research findings are\u000d\u000a      effectively communicated to the policymakers. The Chief Officer,\u000d\u000a      Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol\u000d\u000a      Secretariat, provided the following statement about the role of the SAP: \"The\u000a        SAP plays an invaluable role in analysing, interpreting, and presenting\u000d\u000a        atmospheric trends. The clarity of this work has enabled global\u000d\u000a        political\/regulatory decisions that have resulted in a continuing\u000d\u000a        improvement of stratospheric ozone levels since the inception of the\u000d\u000a        Montreal Protocol in 1987, as well as aiding the many amendments to\u000d\u000a        accelerate the Protocol's progress. I would like to thank Professor Pyle\u000d\u000a        and his team for their continued dedicated efforts to provide a sound\u000d\u000a        scientific basis for our work in protecting the environment\".LC2\u000d\u000a    Pyle's involvement in the Montreal Protocol has been funded since 2007 by\u000d\u000a      DEFRA, to whom he provides ad hoc advice.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on Health The Montreal Protocol has had a major impact in\u000d\u000a      avoiding ozone depletion, in avoiding climate change thanks to the phase\u000d\u000a      out of those ozone-depleting substances which are also greenhouse gases,\u000d\u000a      and in preventing UV-related health issues. A recent paper, using model\u000d\u000a      calculations by the Pyle group, indicates that, by 2030, the Protocol will\u000d\u000a      have prevented two million cases of skin cancer annually, and further\u000d\u000a      reinforces the case for the Montreal Protocol.9 Ensuring that\u000d\u000a      the Protocol is adjusted and amended according to the latest scientific\u000d\u000a      developments is essential to their continuing impact.\u000d\u000a    EU Legislation The various assessments, informed by Cambridge\u000d\u000a      research and that of the international community, led to a strengthening\u000d\u000a      of the regulations covering production and emission of ozone depleting\u000d\u000a      substances. EU legislation was introduced in 2008 to speed up the phase\u000d\u000a      out of the HCFC family of halocarbons, replacements for the CFCs.10\u000d\u000a      Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), another family of halocarbons, are replacement\u000d\u000a      gases for the ODS which have the attractive property that they do not lead\u000d\u000a      to any ozone depletion. They are, however, strong greenhouse gases and so\u000d\u000a      there are very good reasons to limit their future growth. Based on the\u000d\u000a      halocarbon research, Dr Harris gave evidence to the European Parliament in\u000d\u000a      June 2011 during a special session of the ENV committee on `Reduction of\u000d\u000a      non-CO2 Emissions'. This session was part of the process which led to a\u000d\u000a      resolution passed by the European Parliament and, in 2013, to the\u000d\u000a      introduction of EU legislation on Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases limiting\u000d\u000a      future HFC usage.11\u000d\u000a    The Senior Administrator for the European Parliament, Committee for\u000d\u000a      Environment, Public Health and Food Safety writes: \"since 2008 I have\u000d\u000a        appreciated the impact of its pioneering research and assessment\u000d\u000a        influence in the regulatory process of the Environment, Public Health\u000d\u000a        and Food Safety Committee of the European Parliament...Overall, research\u000d\u000a        by the Cambridge group made a significant impact to both policy actions\u000d\u000a        and environmental protection.LC3\u000d\u000a    Working with Industry Pyle continues to provide informal,\u000d\u000a      independent advice to industries producing and using halocarbons (e.g.\u000d\u000a      3M).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Atmospheric science research in the Department of Chemistry, University\u000d\u000a      of Cambridge has played a leading role in demonstrating the depletion of\u000d\u000a      the ozone layer following anthropogenic emissions of halogenated compounds\u000d\u000a      and other Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS). This research has been a key\u000d\u000a      input into the series of assessment reports that have made the case to\u000d\u000a      policy makers for the strengthening of the Montreal Protocol.

Co-directed by Professor John Pyle (1920 Professor of Physical\u000d\u000a      Chemistry, University of Cambridge, in Cambridge since 1985), the centre\u000d\u000a      has since its inception been among the world leaders in stratospheric\u000d\u000a      ozone science. Pyle played a leading role in the development of\u000d\u000a      state-of-the-art chemistry\/climate models for the stratosphere. The\u000d\u000a      physical and chemical processes in his numerical models have been\u000d\u000a      evaluated successfully against atmospheric observations and so can be used\u000d\u000a      to explain the role of ozone depleting substances in past changes in\u000d\u000a      atmospheric composition and can be used to project future changes. Dr Neil\u000d\u000a      Harris (Dept of Chemistry since 1990, NERC Advanced Fellow since 2010) has\u000d\u000a      been a pioneer in the analysis of existing atmospheric ozone data to\u000d\u000a      understand long-term changes in ozone, and in conducting field experiments\u000d\u000a      in the Arctic to quantify the detailed chemical processes leading to ozone\u000d\u000a      loss each winter. He has been making atmospheric measurements of\u000d\u000a      ozone-depleting halocarbons including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and\u000d\u000a      shorter-lived compounds since the mid-1990s.1\u000d\u000a    Together these researchers have made substantial contributions to the\u000d\u000a      understanding of global ozone loss and to the contribution of ozone\u000d\u000a      depleting substances. Examples of relevant underpinning research performed\u000d\u000a      between 1993 and 2013 are listed below:\u000d\u000a    A) Model calculations performed by the Pyle group have demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      CFCs and other halogenated compounds have led to depletion of ozone in the\u000d\u000a      Arctic; they confirmed that severe Arctic ozone loss occurs in some\u000d\u000a      winters, following the same chemical mechanism as found in Antarctica,2\u000d\u000a      in agreement with observational analyses that the Pyle group helped to\u000d\u000a      develop.3\u000d\u000a    B) Harris has explained the observed decadal changes in ozone in middle\u000d\u000a      latitudes, showing that both chemical and dynamical processes play a role\u000d\u000a      in the observed ozone changes.4\u000d\u000a    C) Pyle's calculations project the future evolution of ozone, explaining\u000d\u000a      how atmospheric ozone concentrations should respond to regulation, with\u000d\u000a      slow `recovery' this century,5 and how these chemistry-climate\u000d\u000a      model projections show that, had the Montreal Protocol not been enacted,\u000d\u000a      ozone depletion would have been even more severe and that consequently\u000d\u000a      large changes in surface temperature and UV radiation would have occurred.6\u000d\u000a    D) The Pyle group has shown that the scientific framework for regulation\u000d\u000a      of short-lived ozone depleting substances is different to that of the\u000d\u000a      longer-lived gases, like the CFCs. For short-lived gases, the Ozone\u000d\u000a      Depletion Potential (ODP), a concept enshrined in legislation, varies with\u000d\u000a      region and season of emission, whereas for long-lived gases the ODP is a\u000d\u000a      constant.7\u000d\u000a    Key researchers in Cambridge that contributed to the research include: Dr\u000d\u000a      Martyn Chipperfield (PDRA and Temporary Assistant Lecturer 1993-1999, now\u000d\u000a      Professor at the University of Leeds) and Dr Peter Braesicke (Senior\u000d\u000a      Researcher, Centre for Atmospheric Science, Cambridge, 1999-2013,\u000d\u000a      Professor at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany since August\u000d\u000a      2013).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32236","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    University of Huddersfield studies in the field of physical organic\u000a      chemistry have led to widespread\u000a      economic, industrial and societal benefits, in large part through the\u000a      continued success of IPOS, the\u000a      formation of which was a direct result of research carried out since the\u000a      early 1990s.

Co-workers include Dr N\u000a      Powles (Senior Research\u000a      Fellow, 2006-present), Dr M Stirling (Senior Research Fellow,\u000a      2006-present), Dr M Chadha\u000a      (Quality Manager, 2010-present), and four Research Fellows, six PhD\u000a      students and four\u000a      technicians. Atherton, Powles and Stirling have more than 60 years'\u000a      industry experience between\u000a      them.\u000a    IPOS has become self-financing, with income of &#163;0.6M p.a. Income from\u000a      consultancy and training\u000a      for the chemical and related industries in particular has grown\u000a      significantly, from around &#163;150,000\u000a      and &#163;8,000 respectively in 2008\/2009 to around &#163;385,000 and &#163;34,000 in\u000a      2012\/2013. IPOS now\u000a      provides full-time employment for 11 members of research staff [5.1].\u000a    IPOS has so far carried out research projects for more than 150\u000a      companies, of which over 70 have\u000a      been SMEs. The large majority of projects and enquiries are from within\u000a      the Yorkshire\/Humberside\u000a      region, where regeneration is critically dependent on new,\u000a      non-traditional, high-technology\u000a      companies, meaning IPOS's expertise has been vital to economic growth in\u000a      the area. Around 30\u000a      enquiries are now received each month from throughout the UK. Of the many\u000a      successful projects,\u000a      one example is their 15-month collaboration on gas-liquid kinetics with\u000a      ACAL Energy, of Runcorn,\u000a      which has led to a &#163;15M venture capital investment [SL1].\u000a    The Society of Chemical Industry has officially recognised the scale and\u000a      significance of Page and\u000a      Atherton's contributions to the industry, most recently through the\u000a      activities of IPOS. Atherton\u000a      received an SCI Chemistry for Industry Award in 2013 in recognition of his\u000a      \"contribution to process\u000a      chemistry\", and Page received the same honour in 2011 for work \"which\u000a      provides a potential major\u000a      benefit to society\" [5.2].\u000a    Specific areas of work undertaken by the research team before and after\u000a      the establishment of\u000a      IPOS have benefited a wide range of stakeholders and end-users, the most\u000a      notable being the\u000a      following.\u000a    i. Synthetic oligonucleotides for therapy\u000a    Huddersfield's work in the area of synthetic oligonucleotides,\u000a      particularly in terms of improving the\u000a      economics of the large-scale synthesis of small interfering RNA (siRNA)\u000a      oligonucleotides, has\u000a      enhanced industry practice. The findings were first applied by Avecia,\u000a      which sponsored early\u000a      research in this field, and later by Pfizer [SL2]. Huddersfield's findings\u000a      [3.1-3.2] have improved\u000a      efficiency and delivered cost benefits by highlighting key considerations\u000a      in the large-scale\u000a      manufacture of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics particularly with regard\u000a      to solvent selection and\u000a      reactant stoichiometries; the large scale synthesis of oligonucleotides\u000a      traditionally involved\u000a      considerable volumes of solvents and excessive amounts of expensive and\u000a      fragile\u000a      phosphoramidite reagents.\u000a    Since 2012 GlaxoSmithKline has supported and drawn on Huddersfield's\u000a      continuing research in\u000a      this area as part of the company's efforts to develop a substantial\u000a      portfolio of oligonucleotide-based\u000a      therapeutics, many of which are in late-stage clinical trials. GSK has\u000a      been guided by Huddersfield's\u000a      studies in devising the synthesis technologies required for stage 3\u000a      trials. GSK's Oligonucleotide\u000a      Synthesis Group has confirmed: \"Your research provides the fundamental\u000a      chemistry understanding\u000a      that we need in order to develop robust, scalable and sustainable\u000a      oligonucleotide manufacturing\u000a      processes.\" [SL3] This further underlines the research's contribution to\u000a      the health of society, as\u000a      therapeutically important mRNAs are used for treating diseases arising\u000a      from genetic disorders.\u000a    ii. Providing solutions to antimicrobial resistance\u000a    Huddersfield's research in the area of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has\u000a      also led to improvements\u000a      in healthcare by helping companies to design new products. The finding\u000a      that the &#946;-lactam ring is\u000a      not inherently reactive [3.4] has contributed to a shift towards novel\u000a      designs of alternative\u000a      antibacterials and Huddersfield's outputs describing the mechanism by\u000a      which &#946;-lactamases\u000a      catalyse the hydrolysis of &#946;-lactams [3.5-3.6] has influenced the\u000a      development of new therapeutics\u000a      such as those developed by Basilea Pharmaceutics, of Basel, Switzerland\u000a      [SL4]. This work has\u000a      anticipated key elements of the Department for Health's `UK Five-Year\u000a      Antimicrobial Resistance\u000a      Strategy', introduced in 2013, one of the principal strategic aims of\u000a      which is to improve knowledge\u000a      and understanding of AMR. Such advances also deliver economic benefits,\u000a      given that AMR is\u000a      currently estimated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and\u000a      Control to cost &#8364;1.5bn in\u000a      healthcare expenses and lost productivity each year.\u000a    iii. Chemical reactions in liquid ammonia\u000a    Huddersfield's work on solvolysis reactions, most notably the finding\u000a      that liquid ammonia can be\u000a      considered a \"green\" solvent, has influenced the industrial manufacture of\u000a      chemicals. The\u000a      technology has been adopted by Syngenta, which has used it to develop \"new\u000a      route options\" and\u000a      has begun transferring these to the company's laboratories [SL5]. Research\u000a      in this area has also\u000a      formed the basis of an IPOS patent application for the conversion of fatty\u000a      acids to amides [5.3].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Huddersfield research in physical organic chemistry has\u000a      delivered economic,\u000a      industrial and societal benefits. It has led to process improvements in\u000a      chemical manufacturing,\u000a      most notably in the optimisation of the synthesis of antisense\u000a      oligonucleotides and in the use of\u000a      liquid ammonia as a solvent. It has also led to the development of new\u000a      inhibitors of bacterial &#946;-lactamases\u000a      for use as antibacterials. The research team's expertise has been\u000a      reflected in the\u000a      success of IPOS (Innovative Physical Organic Solutions), a unit\u000a      established in 2006 to carry out\u000a      research in process and other areas of chemistry for the chemical\u000a      industry.

Professors M. Page (Dean of School 1989-2004;\u000a      Deputy VC 2004-2010;\u000a      Managing Director, IPOS, 2006-present), J. Atherton (2007-present) and A.\u000a      Laws (1992-present;\u000a      submitted in UoA 5) have each contributed research outputs describing\u000a      fundamental research\u000a      undertaken in collaboration with, and sponsored by, industry. Reflecting\u000a      the rapid and sustained\u000a      expansion of activity in this area, Innovative Physical Organic Solutions\u000a      (IPOS), a research unit\u000a      offering analytical and chemical process development services to the\u000a      chemical industry, was\u000a      established in the Department of Chemistry in 2006. IPOS entered a period\u000a      of rapid expansion in\u000a      2009 with the award of European Regional Development Funding (ERDF) of\u000a      &#163;3.6M [G1]. Some of\u000a      the underpinning research described here was carried out in IPOS. The IPOS\u000a      team has both\u000a      furthered existing strands of research (e.g. in liquid ammonia) and also\u000a      initiated a number of new\u000a      themes (e.g. in catalyst development).\u000a    i. Synthetic oligonucleotides for therapy (2001-present)\u000a    Small interfering RNA (siRNA) and antisense oligonucleotides have been\u000a      demonstrated as\u000a      powerful tools for chemotherapy. There is currently no efficient synthesis\u000a      of oligonucleotides on an\u000a      industrial scale. Huddersfield's studies of the mechanisms of the chemical\u000a      synthesis of\u000a      oligonucleotides have provided an understanding of the synthetic\u000a      parameters that can be used to\u000a      optimise large-scale synthesis. The first part of this work was funded\u000a      directly by Avecia\u000a      Biotechnology through PhD studentships for Powles (2001-2004) and Russell\u000a      (2004-2007) [G2].\u000a      Powles' work explored the mechanism of H-phosphonate coupling of\u000a      oligonucleotides [3.1], while\u000a      Russell's examined several steps involved in the oligonucleotide synthesis\u000a      cycle employing\u000a      phosphoramidite chemistry [3.2]. More recently this work has been taken up\u000a      by GlaxoSmithKline\u000a      who have continued to support this research through a CASE award for\u000a      Scotson [G3].\u000a    ii. Providing solutions to antimicrobial resistance (1993-present)\u000a    The rise of bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been highlighted in\u000a      recent years. Huddersfield's\u000a      work on &#946;-lactams was initiated by Page, who went on to continue research\u000a      in this area with Laws.\u000a      The team has published more than 50 papers since 1993 that contribute to\u000a      understanding how\u000a      bacteria are able to evade the action of &#946;-lactam antibiotics. The work\u000a      has focused on\u000a      demonstrating that &#946;-lactams are not particularly \"strained\" four-membered\u000a      rings, a notion\u000a      facilitating the design of novel alternative antibacterials [3.3]. Through\u000a      measurement of the intrinsic\u000a      reactivity of a number of small ring systems including &#946;-lactams,\u000a      &#946;-sultams and\u000a      azaphosphetidienes, the work at Huddersfield has facilitated the design of\u000a      novel alternative\u000a      enzyme inhibitors of bacterial enzymes [3.4]. Investigations into serine\u000a      and metallo-&#946;-lactamase\u000a      enzymes, which are increasingly important causes of bacterial resistance\u000a      to &#946;-lactam antibiotics,\u000a      has raised the possibility of developing novel methods of inhibition\u000a      [3.5]. The work has been\u000a      funded through collaboration with pharmaceutical companies (including\u000a      AstraZeneca and GSK)\u000a      and engagement in European Networks [G4].\u000a    iii. Chemical reactions in liquid ammonia (2007-present)\u000a    The use of liquid ammonia as a reaction solvent is advantageous because\u000a      product isolation and\u000a      solvent recycling are greatly facilitated, meaning ammonia can be\u000a      considered an environmentally\u000a      \"green\" solvent. Fundamental research in Huddersfield on the use of\u000a      ammonia as a reaction\u000a      solvent has revealed the scope of reactions that can be transferred to a\u000a      liquid ammonia medium,\u000a      with both catalysed [3.6] and non-catalysed [3.7] reactions showing\u000a      potential benefits. Supported\u000a      by funding from Syngenta [G5], current research portfolios include\u000a      continuous flow processes and\u000a      biotransformations in liquid ammonia.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32237","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact has been generated by two routes. The first is through the\u000a      synthesis of porous solids and the capability for tuning porosities in\u000a      both adsorbent and catalyst synthesis. The second is through improvements\u000a      to thermal analytical techniques and the new information available on the\u000a      structure\/function relationships in solid-state systems. The techniques\u000a      have been used in the characterisation of catalytic materials and\u000a      pyrotechnic materials, with the associated benefits to users and to\u000a      manufacturers, including global companies and the defence industry.\u000a    We have been working with Johnson Matthey (JM) since 1999 (as ICI\/Synetix\u000a      in the early years), applying controlled-rate techniques to catalysts and\u000a      catalyst precursors with a view both to strengthening the understanding of\u000a      the processes that occur in the preparation of solid catalysts and to\u000a      improving the properties of solid catalysts prepared by thermal methods.\u000a      Our (Parkes' and Barnes') work with JM, based on that reported in\u000a      references A1-A3 above, has illustrated the potential for controlling\u000a      catalyst morphology, especially in calcined materials, so offering the\u000a      prospect to tune key catalyst properties. Through both our early\u000a      fundamental work and the continuing collaboration with JM, knowledge\u000a      transfer to JM has occurred. Impact has been felt by JM throughout the\u000a      assessment period and continues to be felt today. The Catalysis R and D\u000a      Director at JM, describes the research as \"crucial for our\u000a          understanding of how to scale and optimise manufacturing processes for\u000a          materials development. This has clear implications for economic and\u000a          environmental benefits for our manufacturing processes and end-users\u000a          of our products\".[S1]\u000a    Joint research with Dstl, Porton Down over a similar period (Parkes and\u000a      Brown) has been aimed at the use of controlled-rate techniques to tailor\u000a      porosity characteristics in activated carbons. The objectives were to\u000a      increase understanding of the synthesis\/preparative factors that control\u000a      the properties of carbon adsorbents, and also to improve the extent to\u000a      which activated carbons can be characterised. This work (reference A3\u000a      above) was ultimately aimed at improving carbon adsorbents for personal\u000a      respirator use by improving the balance between effective adsorption\u000a      performance and resistance to airflow. The benefits in these directions\u000a      were witnessed at Dstl in the 2008-2010 period and the Chief Scientist\u000a      (Physical Sciences Dept), Porton Down, reports that:.... (Our\u000a        collaborative work) \"has greatly increased our understanding of the\u000a        factors that affect the performance of activated carbons used in\u000a        respirator filters including the influence of metal impregnants and pore\u000a        structure on removal of toxic chemicals from contaminated airstreams. In\u000a        particular the controlled-rate activation methods developed\u000a          at Huddersfield have enable excellent control over the properties of\u000a          activated carbons, resulting in significant improvements in adsorbent\u000a          performance and their long-term stability\".[S2]\u000a    A similar approach to tuning carbon pore structures using controlled-rate\u000a      techniques has recently been applied to carbon adsorbents for use in\u000a      cigarette filters (2008-date, funded by BAT). [B1] The joint research\u000a      (Parkes) has shown that it is possible to change the internal structure of\u000a      an activated carbon derived from an environmentally-preferred\u000a      vegetable-based source to maximise its adsorption properties when\u000a      operating under high flow rates. The Research Manager at BAT confirms that\u000a      in the period since 2010 \"significant enhancements in the adsorption of\u000a        some key smoke toxicants were achieved (using the methods developed\u000a      in Huddersfield) compared to the use of conventional materials\".[S3]\u000a      An international patent with BAT has been granted. [B2]\u000a    Our expertise and unique capability in adsorption calorimetric techniques\u000a      have been applied to work with MEL Chemicals (Brown). Over the period from\u000a      2003 we have been using these techniques, based on references A4 and A5\u000a      above, to characterise modified zirconia catalysts, significantly\u000a      increasing the company's understanding of the structure\/function\u000a      relationship in these materials. Impact has been felt in two areas. The\u000a      first is in designing doped zirconias with controlled acidity\/basicity for\u000a      use mainly in auto catalysts but also in gas clean-up catalysts [B3]\u000a      (2008-2011). The second is in the design of lithium zirconate catalysts\u000a      for biodiesel synthesis (2011-13). A patent was filed on our joint work on\u000a      lithium ziroconate in 2012 [B4] and the work has been presented at\u000a      numerous conferences. The Divisional Research and Development Director\u000a      says that this work has \"strengthened our product range. In\u000a          monetary terms, the joint research has certainly brought benefit to\u000a          MEL\".[S4]\u000a    Over the period 2000 to date, Charsley has been carrying out research\u000a      with the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, QinetiQ Ltd, armasuisse,\u000a      Switzerland and the Finnish Defence Forces. In this work a series of\u000a      advanced and unique thermal analytical techniques (based on reference A6\u000a      above) have been used to characterise the strongly exothermic reactions of\u000a      a range of pyrotechnic compositions, with a view to designing new\u000a      materials using more benign compounds than those that have traditionally\u000a      been used, particularly perchlorates. [B5] This has resulted in a series\u000a      of new formulations (introduced 2008-2010) based on magnesium alloy-sodium\u000a      nitrate-calcium resinate compositions. The overall programme was sponsored\u000a      by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Programme (SERDP),\u000a      US Department of Defence and in 2009 was awarded the SERDP Project of\u000a        the Year Prize. The Principal Capability Group Leader at QinetiQ\u000a      involved in this work confirms that the contribution of Huddersfield \"was\u000a        pivotal to the consortium being awarded the project (in competition with\u000a        US research laboratories) and the prize\", adding that \"the\u000a        reputation of your team and quality of work performed at Huddersfield\u000a        has allowed the UK to benefit from a number of long term international\u000a        collaborative studies on pyrotechnics and novel materials\". [S5]\u000a      Through facilitating the study of these reactive materials, says QinetiQ,\u000a      the University has \"contributed to defence research both in the UK\u000a          and internationally\".\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Methods to improve control over thermally-induced solid state\u000a      transformations have been developed in Huddersfield and applied to\u000a      materials synthesis and materials characterisation.

The new thermal techniques (including various\u000a        \"controlled-rate\" processes, using both conventional and microwave\u000a        heating) have allowed increased control in synthesis, and increased\u000a        precision in characterisation, leading to finer control of material\u000a        properties and better understanding of many thermally-induced\u000a        solid-state processes.\u000a    Barnes and Parkes (1997-2009) developed controlled-rate methods of\u000a      thermal analysis in which the heating regime is continuously controlled by\u000a      feedback from the rate of the thermally-induced reaction of a solid\u000a      sample, [A1, A2] greatly improving the quality of information provided.\u000a      The techniques were extended to control not just heating programmes but\u000a      also, for example, over-gas compositions. [Grants G1, G2]\u000a    The techniques were scaled-up for materials preparation, firstly in\u000a      carbon and impregnated carbon activation (Dstl 1997-, BAT 2003-), and\u000a      latterly through controlling calcination techniques for catalyst synthesis\u000a      more generally. [A3] [Grants G3-G6] Barnes, Parkes and Charsley, over\u000a      1997-2004, applied controlled-rate algorithms to microwave thermal\u000a      analytical techniques [Grants G7-G10], where they offer the particular\u000a      benefit of precise temperature control even when sample dielectric\u000a      properties are changing. Adapting microwave controlled-rate methods to\u000a      semi- preparative and then preparative scale took place over 2004-2009.\u000a      Current work (Brown and Parkes) is focussed on microwave-induced\u000a      controlled production of mixed metal oxide catalysts through calcination\u000a      of the hydroxides. [A4] These dehydration processes involve large changes\u000a      in microwave coupling and, without controlled-rate technology, temperature\u000a      control is not possible.\u000a    More widely, solid materials characterisation has been facilitated by the\u000a      development and refinement of adsorption calorimetric techniques by Brown\u000a      (1997-). [A5] [Grants G11-G13] These techniques provide unique information\u000a      on the abundance, strength and strength distribution of active sites on\u000a      the surfaces of solid catalysts and adsorbents. Two approaches have been\u000a      used, based on 1) the progressive adsorption of probe gases from a flowing\u000a      carrier gas and 2) the progressive adsorption under static conditions\u000a      where adsorption equilibrium is achieved at each stage of the addition of\u000a      probe gas. The unique capability in this area held at Huddersfield has led\u000a      to almost 40 papers, and many academic and industrial collaborations.\u000a    In another area in which our novel thermal methods have been applied to\u000a      chemical systems in new ways, Charsley has studied metal-oxidant\u000a      pyrotechnic reactions (1997-date). He has used both the new thermal\u000a      methods described above and other specialised thermal techniques designed\u000a      for studying these very reactive materials, such as modulated temperature\u000a      differential calorimetry and sample ignition-controlled thermal analysis.\u000a      [Grants G14-G16] The use of these techniques, in conjunction with chemical\u000a      analysis, has proved to be an effective approach to investigating the\u000a      reaction mechanisms of a wide range of pyrotechnic systems and has been\u000a      extended to studying the mechanism of ageing under ambient conditions in\u000a      collaboration with industrial partners (e.g. QinetiQ, 1998-2009).

Specific recommendations made in\u000d\u000a      the Strategy report were to (i) set up an independent coordinating\u000d\u000a      body to govern the e-infrastructure that reports directly to the\u000d\u000a      Government, (ii) drive the development of software, hardware and\u000d\u000a      networking for all stakeholders (including national supercomputing service\u000d\u000a      providers and Research Councils) in the e-infrastructure, and (iii) offer\u000d\u000a      e-science training to develop the next generation of computationally aware\u000d\u000a      researchers who are able to use the improved e-infrastructure. Coveney's\u000d\u000a      role in directing and shaping these recommendations was directly\u000d\u000a      consequent on the UCL team's research in computational science, including\u000d\u000a      computational chemistry.\u000d\u000a    This document in turn fed into and informed a key policy document\u000d\u000a      entitled A Strategic Vision for UK e-Infrastructure, commissioned\u000d\u000a      by Willetts and published by the Department for Business, Innovation and\u000d\u000a      Skills (BIS) in January 2012 [B]. This document addressed the advanced\u000d\u000a      computational capacity of the UK as a system (i.e. as an\u000d\u000a      e-infrastructure), and proposed a series of recommendations on software,\u000d\u000a      hardware, networks, data storage and skills to help develop this\u000d\u000a      e-infrastructure. In particular, the Vision report took forward\u000d\u000a      the specific recommendations made in the Strategy report,\u000d\u000a      demonstrating that the Strategy report informed Government\u000d\u000a      understanding of the issues. As a direct result of the first of these\u000d\u000a      recommendations the Government created the UK E-Infrastructure Leadership\u000d\u000a      Council (ELC) in March 2012 [C]. The ELC has the responsibility to advise\u000d\u000a      the Government on e-infrastructure development and to develop a wider plan\u000d\u000a      for stakeholder engagement. It is currently working on mechanisms for\u000d\u000a      engaging industry and healthcare with the newly funded e-infrastructure,\u000d\u000a      including an \"On Ramp\" programme that seeks to identify and remove\u000d\u000a      barriers to the uptake of e-infrastructure by UK PLCs. The strong\u000d\u000a      influence of the Strategy report on the Vision report is\u000d\u000a      clearly evidenced in the Chairman's foreword and the references of the\u000d\u000a      latter report [B]. For example, the Chairman wrote: \"I was commissioned by\u000d\u000a      the Minister to write a report on how we might create an e-infrastructure\u000d\u000a      that would support a strong public-private partnership. [...] We have been\u000d\u000a      able to move quickly by building on some excellent analysis. I think\u000d\u000a      particularly of the work of the academic community summarised in the\u000d\u000a      report by Peter Coveney Strategy for the UK Research Computing\u000d\u000a        Ecosystem\" [B].\u000d\u000a    As a result of these two policy documents (mainly the Strategy\u000d\u000a      report, which was already published at the time), in October 2011 the\u000d\u000a      Government earmarked &#163;145 million (increased to &#163;165 million in early\u000d\u000a      2012) to improve the UK's HPC capabilities and wider e-infrastructure [D,\u000d\u000a      E]. This investment has resulted in improvements to existing\u000d\u000a      e-infrastructure such as the UK academic network JANET and high-capacity\u000d\u000a      data storage across the Research Councils, and has funded a number of HPC\u000d\u000a      activities in the UK including Emerald, one of the largest Graphics\u000d\u000a      Processing Unit systems in Europe, now located in the Rutherford Appleton\u000d\u000a      Laboratory in Daresbury, and IRIDIS, a conventional 100-teraFLOPS\u000d\u000a      supercomputer, located at the University of Southampton. These activities\u000d\u000a      have vastly increased the computing capacity and capability in the UK.\u000d\u000a      This has wide-ranging industrial and economic impact, including allowing\u000d\u000a      the NHS and UK PLCs to use these resources, and attracting hi-tech\u000d\u000a      industry from overseas. For example, companies including IBM, Intel and\u000d\u000a      Cisco have already made investments into the UK following this Government\u000d\u000a      investment in e-infrastructure [F].\u000d\u000a    The Vision report (and therefore the Strategy report) has\u000d\u000a      further influenced Government spending, with the Government's on-going\u000d\u000a      commitment to improving UK e-infrastructure demonstrated by the allocation\u000d\u000a      of an additional &#163;189 million in capital funding to this area in December\u000d\u000a      2012. This investment was part of the &#163;600 million capital funding for\u000d\u000a      science announced in the Chancellor's 2012 Autumn Statement, and the\u000d\u000a      amount allocated to e-infrastructure was communicated by Willetts at\u000d\u000a      Policy Exchange in January 2013, where he described e-infrastructure &#8212; or\u000d\u000a      \"Big Data\" &#8212; as one of the \"eight great technologies\" which will propel\u000d\u000a      the UK to future growth [F]. The &#163;189 million, to be invested over the\u000d\u000a      next two years, has been allocated to areas including \"e-Infrastructure\u000d\u000a      for Biosciences\" and \"Administrative Data Research Centres\" [G]; it was\u000d\u000a      announced in February 2013 that &#163;30 million has already been awarded to\u000d\u000a      the Hartree Centre in Daresbury and its academic and industrial partners,\u000d\u000a      in part to develop new technology to make supercomputers more efficient\u000d\u000a      [H].\u000d\u000a    The work of the UCL team has also informed policy debate. In June 2013,\u000d\u000a      Coveney was invited to speak at a House of Lords meeting about scientific\u000d\u000a      infrastructure [I], as part of an inquiry into that topic launched by the\u000d\u000a      Science and Technology Committee in May 2013. He reminded the audience of\u000d\u000a      the recommendations for UK e-infrastructure made in the Strategy\u000d\u000a      report, and explained that whilst the initial Government investments and\u000d\u000a      formation of the ELC are excellent outcomes of this report, there are a\u000d\u000a      number of critical recommendations that have yet to be implemented. These\u000d\u000a      include holistic management of investments in e-infrastructure, a focus on\u000d\u000a      software development in addition to investments in hardware, and the\u000d\u000a      provision of appropriate training across a wide range of disciplines. His\u000d\u000a      presentation sparked considerable discussion and debate amongst meeting\u000d\u000a      attendees about these and other issues relating to UK e-infrastructure.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    In 2011, a leading role was given to Peter Coveney in UCL's Department of\u000d\u000a      Chemistry in defining the future strategy for the UK's e-infrastructure,\u000d\u000a      based on the department's expertise and research in this field. This\u000d\u000a      appointment led to the publication of the Strategy for the UK Research\u000d\u000a        Computing Ecosystem document, which has since stimulated debate\u000d\u000a      amongst policy makers and informed government policy. On the basis of its\u000d\u000a      recommendations, the government has set up an advisory E-Infrastructure\u000d\u000a      Leadership Council and allocated &#163;354 million to improving the UK's\u000d\u000a      high-performance computing capabilities and wider e-infrastructure, a move\u000d\u000a      that is having wide-ranging industrial and economic impact in the UK.

A\u000d\u000a      single e-infrastructure may involve the interoperation of high-performance\u000d\u000a      computing (HPC), cloud computing, mid-range computer systems, databases,\u000d\u000a      networks, image resources, instruments, software and people, which may all\u000d\u000a      be geographically dispersed across a nation or even across the world.\u000d\u000a    A research group in UCL's Department of Chemistry makes use of\u000d\u000a      e-infrastructures to access globally distributed computational resources,\u000d\u000a      including some of the world's largest supercomputers. In addition to\u000d\u000a      carrying out their own research using computational science, the group\u000d\u000a      also researches the use and development of computational resources. This\u000d\u000a      includes the development of tools that enable users to make use of\u000d\u000a      e-infrastructures more easily.\u000d\u000a    The unification of distributed computational resources within and between\u000d\u000a      e-infrastructures to solve challenging problems is known as grid\u000d\u000a      computing. It is conducted through the use of software &#8212; referred to as\u000d\u000a      middleware &#8212; which ties together the resources from the e-infrastructures\u000d\u000a      that constitute the grid; however, these middleware are usually complex\u000d\u000a      and difficult for end users to deploy, with the result that the full power\u000d\u000a      of computational grids is rarely realised. To tackle this problem and\u000d\u000a      encourage the integrated use of dispersed resources, the UCL group\u000d\u000a      developed the Application Hosting Environment (AHE), a lightweight (i.e.\u000d\u000a      simpler than other middleware tools) but powerful middleware tool that\u000d\u000a      hides much of the complexity of the grid from the user.\u000d\u000a    The first version of the AHE was developed in 2006 by the UCL group and\u000d\u000a      collaborators at the University of Manchester (McKeown and Pickles) [1].\u000d\u000a      The Manchester team helped to define the architecture; the implementation\u000d\u000a      and deployment were performed by UCL. Version 2.0, with enhanced features\u000d\u000a      and usability, was developed by the UCL group's Peter Coveney (Professor\u000d\u000a      2002-present) in 2009 [2]. The AHE consists of an ensemble of programs\u000d\u000a      written in Perl with command-line and Graphical User Interface client\u000d\u000a      tools, and is a form of \"non-invasive\" middleware, meaning that it is not\u000d\u000a      necessary for grid management teams to usually even be aware that the AHE\u000d\u000a      is interfacing with the lower-level middleware resident on the different\u000d\u000a      e-infrastructures. The AHE provides the user with a single interface to\u000d\u000a      all computing resources (e.g. different supercomputers) on which they have\u000d\u000a      accounts, enabling them to perform all manner of complex workflows on\u000d\u000a      these resources, from the most basic form of single job submission to\u000d\u000a      complex orchestrated sets of applications.\u000d\u000a    Previous research conducted by the UCL group included international\u000d\u000a      leading work on soft matter and computational chemistry, all using\u000d\u000a      high-performance computing, visualisation and computational steering to\u000d\u000a      make new discoveries in these domains of the chemical sciences. The AHE\u000d\u000a      was developed to facilitate these investigations, and has since been\u000d\u000a      exploited by the UCL group to conduct further research pertaining to the\u000d\u000a      chemical and biomedical sciences, which is leading to broad impact in\u000d\u000a      medical applications. For example, it enabled them to use grid computing\u000d\u000a      resources in both Europe and the US in 2008 to apply molecular dynamics\u000d\u000a      techniques to study the structure and stability of DNA intercalated in\u000d\u000a      layered double hydroxides (LDHs) [3]. Their simulations indicate that DNA\u000d\u000a      intercalated into LDHs is endowed with enhanced structural stability, a\u000d\u000a      finding which gives support to the origins-of-life theory that LDHs could\u000d\u000a      have acted as a protective environment for the first nucleic acids in\u000d\u000a      extreme environmental conditions. In another example, in 2008-10 the AHE\u000d\u000a      enabled the group to use combined UK and US computational resources to\u000d\u000a      estimate and rank the binding affinities of inhibitors with the wild type\u000d\u000a      and variants of HIV-1 protease, an attractive target for HIV\/AIDS therapy\u000d\u000a      [4, 5]. This research showed that molecular dynamics can achieve accurate\u000d\u000a      and rapid relative binding affinity ranking. Indeed, the concerted use of\u000d\u000a      computing resources and automated workflow enabled through the AHE make\u000d\u000a      turnaround of an array of binding affinities feasible within three days;\u000d\u000a      such rapidity is crucial for enhancing patient-specific clinical decision\u000d\u000a      support.\u000d\u000a    UCL owes its prominence in the field to the strength of its published\u000d\u000a      research, which has led to Coveney and others being appointed to\u000d\u000a      leadership positions relating to the use of computers in research,\u000d\u000a      including Coveney's chairmanship of the Collaborative Computational\u000d\u000a      Projects Steering Panel (since 2006) and membership of the UK High-End\u000d\u000a      Computing Strategy Committee (2006-2010).

Clark's\u000a      fundamental studies, collaboration activities and continuing work in this\u000a      field provided a vital contribution to the adoption and widespread use of\u000a      RS in heritage science and museums. His significant contribution has been\u000a      recognised by The Royal Society, who awarded him the 2008 Bakerian Lecture\u000a      for \"his pioneering work using the technique of RS as applied to artwork\u000a      and artefacts\". The society added:\u000a    \"The research is having a profound effect on the art, archaeology and\u000a      museum worlds; he [Clark] has shown that numerous profound and critical\u000a      issues which could not previously be addressed can now not only be\u000a      addressed but resolved. This has influenced major institutions such as the\u000a      Louvre, the Getty, the Metropolitan of New York and the British Museum\u000a      (among others) to install Raman microscope systems in recognition of their\u000a      striking effectiveness as analytical tools.\" [A] Additionally, his work\u000a      has been further recognised by a number of eminent scientific and\u000a      scholarly organisations (American Philosophical Society, the Royal Society\u000a      of Chemistry, the Fondation de la Maison de la Chimie and the Chemical\u000a      Heritage Foundation) in the last five years, each of which has\u000a      acknowledged Clark's contribution to bridging the science world with the\u000a      humanities and arts, and demonstrating chemistry's role in shaping society\u000a      [B].\u000a    The Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum\u000a      (V&amp;A) in London have both employed former members of the Clark group.\u000a      Their expertise in RS, developed whilst at UCL, benefits analysis of art\u000a      and historic artefacts at the institutions. The IMA established a\u000a      Conservation Science Laboratory in 2011 and one of the first instruments\u000a      purchased for the new facility was a Raman spectrometer [C], an instrument\u000a      that vastly expanded the museum's conservation and analytical\u000a      capabilities. Prior to this, only optical and polarised light spectroscopy\u000a      were available, techniques that are not only time consuming to use but are\u000a      of limited value in pigment identification. Around 50 objects are analysed\u000a      in the facility per year, and RS analysis is applied to all of them at\u000a      some point during their study [C]. In 2012, in partnership with Cincinnati\u000a      Art Museum, a combination of RS and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy were\u000a      used to map the location of specific pigments and, following a computer\u000a      reconstruction, revealed the original appearance of the white flowers in\u000a      Vincent van Gogh's painting of 1890 Undergrowth with Two Figures;\u000a      this reconstruction is now displayed to the public [C].\u000a    In 2009, in collaboration with Clark, five miniatures at the V&amp;A were\u000a      unambiguously confirmed to be modern forgeries (five `Spanish Forger'\u000a      paintings), and the detection of metallic bismuth on an illuminated\u000a      Bourdichon miniature added to the knowledge of trade routes and pigment\u000a      availability in medieval Europe [D]. Subsequently, in 2010, having\u000a      benefited from access to the Raman facilities and collaborating with the\u000a      team at UCL, the V&amp;A purchased its own Raman spectrometer, a resource\u000a      that is used on a weekly basis [E]. Having a Raman spectrometer available\u000a      at the V&amp;A has made it possible to analyse non-destructively and in\u000a        situ museum objects that were, until recently, off-limits due to\u000a      restrictions to their sampling. Furthermore, where inorganic pigments,\u000a      minerals and gemstones are concerned, analyses now take a few seconds or\u000a      minutes to complete, bringing about considerable savings in terms of staff\u000a      time and increasing productivity. In all, around 150 objects are now\u000a      studied each year using the technique at the V&amp;A, with analysis\u000a      results not only enabling dating and authentication of collections, but\u000a      also informing curators as to whether objects are appropriate for proposed\u000a      exhibitions and impacting upon their conservation [E]. Utilising their own\u000a      system in 2012, V&amp;A staff were able to investigate distinct\u000a      \"fingerprints\" of pigments for different artists, which led to changes in\u000a      the attributions of three portrait miniatures: the original Tudor\u000a      portraits of \"Mr and Mrs Croker\", which have suffered from troubled\u000a      attribution histories, were attributed to Nicholas Hilliard or his\u000a      workshop; and a third portrait miniature (miniature 630-1882) was\u000a      reattributed from Isaac Oliver to Hilliard or his workshop [F].\u000a    UK libraries (Bodleian Library and BL) have also benefited from\u000a      collaborating with the UCL group and implementing RS analysis. By using RS\u000a      to ascertain and understand the chemical behaviour of specific pigments,\u000a      conservators are now able to control the display and storage schedule to\u000a      reduce degradation of objects, understand and update conservation records,\u000a      add support to conservation strategies, and also provide instructions to\u000a      readers about certain items for which there may be a health and safety\u000a      impact; for example, the requirement to wear gloves where poisonous\u000a      arsenic-containing pigments are identified (especially in the case of\u000a      Indian manuscripts). Furthermore, the collaboration between UCL and the BL\u000a      (1996 to 2008) was highlighted in the House of Lords Science and\u000a      Technology Committee Science and Heritage report as an example of how\u000a      academics and curators can work together to develop academic agendas\u000a      whilst answering both curatorial and conservation questions. This same\u000a      report concluded that collaboration between university and museum-based\u000a      scientists is crucial to heritage science. Subsequently, the Science and\u000a      Heritage Programme (established to take forward the recommendations from\u000a      these reports) has promoted further collaboration of this nature through\u000a      research clusters and networking funding, with examples reported in the\u000a      most recent review (2012) [G].\u000a    The pigment database developed by UCL is also valued by researchers and\u000a      is considered significant to the conservation science field because it was\u000a      one of the first online reference spectra collections for art materials.\u000a      The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (MFA) printed out the set of UCL Raman\u000a      spectra as a reference when they purchased their Raman spectrometer in\u000a      2008, and still regularly consult the printouts today [H]. The images of\u000a      67 of the Raman reference spectra generated by UCL, along with links to\u000a      the UCL Raman Spectroscopic Library website, are included in the\u000a      Conservation &amp; Art Materials Encyclopedia Online (CAMEO) database that\u000a      was developed by the MFA &#8212; a database that is regularly accessed\u000a      worldwide. The Schorr Family Associate Research Scientist at the MFA said\u000a      in May 2013: \"in the last year, 80,000 unique visitors provided over\u000a      250,000 page views. The hits came from 165 countries. A random check of\u000a      several pigment pages that include UCL reference spectra gave the\u000a      following hit results over the past year: berberine (14), lazurite (31),\u000a      malachite (298), orpiment (93), vermilion (219).\" [H]\u000a    The UCL research has also had an impact on the sale of Raman\u000a      spectrometers by Renishaw, a world leader in the manufacture and supply of\u000a      these instruments. The company's International Sales Manager and\u000a      Applications Specialist said: \"From a commercial aspect the importance of\u000a      this field of interest [the use of RS in heritage work] has led to a\u000a      significant number of sales that one could argue would not have been\u000a      possible without Professor Clark's fundamental studies\". Renishaw was the\u000a      first supplier of a high-end bench Raman microscope and today enjoys a\u000a      dominant position in the marketplace. It sells instruments worldwide [text\u000a      removed for publication] [I].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Department of Chemistry at UCL has pioneered the use of Raman\u000a      spectroscopy (RS) for the identification of pigments in and the in\u000a        situ examination of objects that are of artistic, cultural, or\u000a      historical importance.

Therefore, he undertook research to enable the full\u000a      realisation of the potential of RS in the non-destructive technical\u000a      examination of art objects. The research carried out at UCL has provided a\u000a      major contribution to this field since 1993, demonstrating the sensitivity\u000a      and precision of the technique in identifying pigments and other\u000a      materials, both rapidly and without ambiguity.\u000a    RS is a non-destructive technique, making it ideal for the analysis of\u000a      organic and inorganic pigments in artworks and artefacts on which\u000a      destructive or sampling techniques &#8212; such as powder X-ray diffraction and\u000a      scanning electron microscopy &#8212; may not be permitted. Furthermore, since\u000a      each distinct material gives rise to a unique Raman spectrum, the\u000a      technique can be used to identify unambiguously which pigments are\u000a      present.\u000a    One of the Clark group's important contributions to the emerging field\u000a      was a 1995 study in which they showed that RS is an ideal technique for\u000a      distinguishing between lead-based yellow pigments used in antiquity. When\u000a      previous conventional non-destructive spectroscopic analyses were used,\u000a      these pigments &#8212; the two types of lead tin yellow, Pb2SnO4\u000a      and PbSn1-xSixO3, and the\u000a      similarly coloured and structured lead antimonate, Pb2Sb2O7\u000a      &#8212; were difficult to identify unambiguously in the presence of other\u000a      compounds commonly found on artefacts, due to their similar, broad\u000a      electronic spectra. The Clark group demonstrated that the pigments could,\u000a      however, be readily distinguished in situ using RS by comparing\u000a      the Raman spectra of laboratory-synthesised lead tin oxides and typical\u000a      contemporary primer and binding agents with those obtained from medieval\u000a      paintings and manuscripts [1].\u000a    During the early work, Clark identified the lack of reference databases\u000a      for the analysis of pigments using RS and proceeded to collect the first\u000a      set of pigment reference spectra at several different excitation\u000a      wavelengths in 1995. This was immediately popular, and both it and an\u000a      updated database published in 2001 are still extensively used by Raman\u000a      scientists all over the world working at the arts-science interface. The\u000a      2001 work [2] also introduced Fourier-Transform (FT) Raman as another\u000a      option for the analysis of organic materials, particularly common binders\u000a      and varnishes, which either show little response to conventional Raman\u000a      excitation or fluoresce.\u000a    In 2001, the Clark group determined under which conditions of laser\u000a      wavelength, power and irradiation time PbO2 and common lead\u000a      pigments Pb3O4, PbO and 2PbCO3&#8226;Pb(OH)2\u000a      degrade, and through which pathways [3]. Their results revealed how to\u000a      correctly identify lead pigments originally used on an artwork, and how to\u000a      recognise when unwanted degradation is occurring during RS analysis. This\u000a      work also validated previous studies on the identification of lead\u000a      pigments by RS, and further confirmed that RS could be used in situ\u000a      on such artefacts without causing degradation, allowing other groups to\u000a      conduct RS studies on lead pigments with confidence.\u000a    Contributions to the field also included many studies conducted jointly\u000a      with cultural heritage institutions [4, 5, 6]. In collaboration with the\u000a      British Library (BL), the Lindisfarne Gospels (from AD 715-721) were\u000a      analysed using RS as, although well studied from a palaeographical\u000a      standpoint, much less was known about the materials used on the\u000a      manuscripts and the methods used in their construction. The details\u000a      regarding the use of pigments in such works were previously identifb01ed\u000a      purely by a visual inspection and had become accepted as fact. As such,\u000a      important information ascribing to date or point of origin for the greater\u000a      understanding in an historical context remained undiscovered. The analysis\u000a      performed on the Lindisfarne Gospels revealed the presence of pigments\u000a      including calcite CaCO3, indigo C16H10N2O2,\u000a      orpiment As2S3, vergaut (indigo mixed with\u000a      orpiment), verdigris (uncertain variant), red lead Pb3O4,\u000a      white lead 2PbCO3&#8226;Pb(OH)2 and gold, confirming that\u000a      most of the pigments that were considered to be there were indeed present\u000a      [4]. Importantly, however, the blue pigment lazurite Na8[Al6Si6O24]Sn\u000a      was not found on the manuscript; instead, all the blue colouring in the\u000a      gospels came from indigo (which was readily available in England at the\u000a      time). Earlier studies of the gospels had implied that there was a trade\u000a      route in the 8th century between Afghanistan &#8212; the location of\u000a      the only source of lazurite at the time &#8212; and Northumberland; in fact, the\u000a      UCL work found the earliest use of lazurite on an English manuscript to be\u000a      more than two centuries later [4]. Interesting studies of astronomical and\u000a      cartographic Islamic folios held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, were\u000a      also made [5]. In a further study, the identification of key pigments on\u000a      \"Young Woman Seated on a Virginal\" supported work from the History of Art\u000a      Department at UCL, by providing persuasive evidence consistent with\u000a      reattribution of this painting to Vermeer [6].

Meanwhile,\u000d\u000a      agri-businesses use the method to create bioavailability profiles for\u000d\u000a      agrochemicals, which informs not only on efficacy but also the fate of the\u000d\u000a      chemicals in terms of environmental risk assessment.\u000d\u000a    In recent years, commercial, open source and \"in-house\" computational\u000d\u000a      modelling software has been developed and made available to users\u000d\u000a      worldwide based upon the Abraham solvation model, in order to provide a\u000d\u000a      framework with which to analyse, rationalise and quantify problems such as\u000d\u000a      solubility and partitioning. For example, the Absolv software is used by\u000d\u000a      chemists to calculate various solvation-associated properties from\u000d\u000a      equations (LFERs) involving transfer from the gas phase to a condensed\u000d\u000a      phase or between different condensed phases, and to carry out\u000d\u000a      structure-based prediction of the solvation parameters required for those\u000d\u000a      calculations [A]. Absolv was first commercialised by Sirius, then later by\u000d\u000a      Pharma Algorithms, who in 2009 partnered with ACD\/Labs; in 2011, the\u000d\u000a      latter launched the \"Percepta Platform\", which includes the Absolv\u000d\u000a      prediction module. From a commercial perspective, Absolv has been, and\u000d\u000a      continues to be, a very important component in ADMET and physicochemical\u000d\u000a      property prediction. As such, Percepta is recognised as a core component\u000d\u000a      of the drug discovery toolkit and is highly valued by research\u000d\u000a      institutions and industrial groups worldwide [A]. In many drug discovery\u000d\u000a      teams at multinational pharmaceutical companies &#8212; [text removed for\u000d\u000a      publication] &#8212; the use of such software, and thus the Abraham model, has\u000d\u000a      become a fundamental part of the way that they understand and optimise\u000d\u000a      drug candidate solubility and partitioning. It has also become fundamental\u000d\u000a      to how they establish vital parameters for determining whether a candidate\u000d\u000a      can be formulated and delivered in sufficient quantities to be effective\u000d\u000a      as a drug. The alternative approach is simply calculating the number of\u000d\u000a      hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor groups and the size of the molecules,\u000d\u000a      which often gives inferior information to the Abraham approach. The useful\u000d\u000a      information provided by the Abraham approach means that scientists need to\u000d\u000a      make fewer compounds before a candidate is selected and do not often make\u000d\u000a      the wrong compounds [text removed for publication].\u000d\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000d\u000a    In 2010, a team from Pfizer developed an in silico model of rat\u000d\u000a      biliary excretion &#8212; an important property in drug discovery &#8212; with the\u000d\u000a      help of the Abraham approach [D]. When Sanofi sought an improvement in the\u000d\u000a      solubility of the main compound used in an oncology program in 2008,\u000d\u000a      commercial software proved unsatisfactory at predicting more soluble\u000d\u000a      compounds; however, the team was able to build their own local models\u000d\u000a      using Abraham descriptors. The model built at pH = 4 was a success,\u000d\u000a      achieving an 82% correct prediction rate of the solubility [text removed\u000d\u000a      for publication] [E]. The results obtained from the work in these and\u000d\u000a      other examples have made a significant contribution to internal research\u000d\u000a      at pharmaceutical companies and have helped to streamline discovery\u000d\u000a      efforts over the last five years.\u000d\u000a    Outside of the pharmaceutical industry, physical chemists supporting\u000d\u000a      Syngenta, one of the world's leading bioscience companies, measure a\u000d\u000a      diverse range of organic\/water partition coefficients to enable the\u000d\u000a      experimental determination of Abraham descriptors and prediction of\u000d\u000a      difficult-to-measure properties such as water\/air, soil\/water and\u000d\u000a      plant-related partitioning processes from LFERs. A significant benefit of\u000d\u000a      this work to Syngenta is that it offers its scientists an alternative way\u000d\u000a      of thinking about and addressing chemical design issues related to\u000d\u000a      expression of activity and environmental fate for agrochemicals, beyond\u000d\u000a      conventional physical chemical properties [F].\u000d\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000d\u000a    The RP-HPLC methods for determining lipophilicity expressed as CHI and ElogP\/ElogD,\u000d\u000a      which were co-developed at UCL, are now in routine use within drug\u000d\u000a      discovery at [text removed for publication], Pfizer, Merck and other drug\u000d\u000a      discovery companies. These techniques allow scientists to measure more\u000d\u000a      quickly and accurately the lipophilicities of potential drug candidates,\u000d\u000a      which helps them assess whether the candidates would be suitable for use in\u000a        vivo. The high-throughput HPLC methods are also useful when\u000d\u000a      scientists wish to modify the lipophilicity (alongside other\u000d\u000a      physicochemical properties) of drug candidates systematically in order to\u000d\u000a      optimise a series and find the most promising compound to progress to\u000d\u000a      further testing. Most uses of the methods are confidential; however, there\u000d\u000a      are a few published examples that demonstrate how this method has helped\u000d\u000a      drug discovery teams to optimise series of compounds. These include novel\u000d\u000a      GPR119 agonists (for a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes) in 2011\u000d\u000a      and ghrelin receptor agonists (for the relief of symptoms of gastroparesis\u000d\u000a      in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) in 2012 by drug discovery teams at\u000d\u000a      Pfizer [H]; and novel cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonists and novel TRPV1\u000d\u000a      antagonists (both investigated as potential treatments of pain) in 2011 by\u000d\u000a      teams at Merck and MSD respectively [I].\u000d\u000a    Additionally, the biomimetic HPLC systems are also now in use at GSK\u000d\u000a      [text removed for publication] and other companies.

The Abraham solvation parameter approach uses linear free energy\u000d\u000a      relationships (LFERs) to describe solvent-solute interactions. It revolves\u000d\u000a      around a set of Abraham descriptors, which characterise the solute and are\u000d\u000a      part of the LFERs. The approach enables systems and solutes to be\u000d\u000a      characterised using multiple linear regression analysis, and in turn\u000d\u000a      predicts solvation properties (such as logP) without the need for an\u000d\u000a      actual experiment. The Abraham approach was first developed within the\u000d\u000a      Department of Chemistry at UCL before the REF research period; however,\u000d\u000a      its application by and subsequent impact on the pharmaceutical,\u000d\u000a      agri-chemical and chemical industries in recent years are underpinned by\u000d\u000a      the department's establishment of the approach and continued work in this\u000d\u000a      area since 1993.\u000d\u000a    Since 1993, the Abraham group at UCL has published more than 300 papers\u000d\u000a      in peer-reviewed journals, detailing the underlying research, application\u000d\u000a      of the method and numerous enhancements to the approach. Key findings\u000d\u000a      documented in these publications include a method (developed together with\u000d\u000a      the Science Development Group at Glaxo Wellcome R&amp;D) for calculating\u000d\u000a      Abraham descriptors from molecular fragment structures [1], which allows\u000d\u000a      drug discovery teams to rapidly assess the solvation properties of drug\u000d\u000a      candidates that have not yet been synthesised; an extension of the Abraham\u000d\u000a      approach to allow for ionic solutes, since many drug candidate molecules\u000d\u000a      are ionised [2]; and the determination (in work conducted with researchers\u000d\u000a      from Glaxo Wellcome, Roche Products and Cardiff University) of solvation\u000d\u000a      equations (LFERs) that characterise important biological processes for\u000d\u000a      drug delivery, such as skin permeation, blood-brain distribution, and\u000d\u000a      intestinal absorption [3], allowing drug discovery teams to predict these\u000d\u000a      properties for drug candidates rapidly.\u000d\u000a    In the late 1990s, this UCL group also collaborated with teams at Glaxo\u000d\u000a      Wellcome Medicines Research Centre [4] and Pfizer's Central Research\u000d\u000a      Division [5] to develop high-throughput reversed-phase high-performance\u000d\u000a      liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) methods for determining lipophilicity\u000d\u000a      (expressed as the chromatographic hydrophobicity index, CHI, and\u000d\u000a      ElogP\/ElogD respectively), an important property in drug discovery. These\u000d\u000a      methods were developed to replace the time-consuming traditional\u000d\u000a      determination of lipophilicity from a measurement of the partition of\u000d\u000a      molecules in the octanol-water system. Advantages of these newer methods\u000d\u000a      include increased accuracy and rapid measurements. The Abraham solvation\u000d\u000a      parameter approach was crucial in validating and refining these faster\u000d\u000a      methods, and was used to confirm that both CHI and ElogP encode the same\u000d\u000a      information as other measures of lipophilicity. Further work, in the early\u000d\u000a      2000s &#8212; again in collaboration with Glaxo Wellcome &#8212; led to the\u000d\u000a      development of biomimetic HPLC systems that measure human serum albumin\u000d\u000a      binding (HSA) and immobilised artificial membrane interaction (CHI IAM)\u000d\u000a      [6], enabling chemists to easily assess a drug candidate's protein binding\u000d\u000a      and membrane affinity &#8212; both important properties for drug discovery.\u000d\u000a    In 2004, the Abraham group concluded that for processes that entail\u000d\u000a      transfer of a solute from one phase to another, no more than fb01ve or six\u000d\u000a      solute descriptors are required to provide a reasonably accurate analysis\u000d\u000a      of a given process [7].

These relationships have\u000a      enabled the translation of the pioneered techniques and their subsequent\u000a      application in product and process optimisation.\u000a    Contribution to commercial software development: The translation\u000a      to industry of QM\/MM techniques has been realised through commercial\u000a      software development. Professor Catlow was one of the lead scientific\u000a      advisors to the Catalysis and Sorption Consortium and subsequently,\u000a      between 2008 and 2011, advisor to the Nanotechnology Consortium. This\u000a      latter consortium, in collaboration with the STFC, developed a QM\/MM\u000a      module (QMERA) for Accelrys' Materials Studio&#174; modelling and simulation\u000a      environment software [A]. Materials Studio enables investigators to relate\u000a      product performance with material properties and behaviour at the\u000a      molecular, atomic, and meso scales. QMERA was first included in Materials\u000a      Studio 4.3 in 2008 [A]. In 2011, Accelrys released a new version of this\u000a      software &#8212; Materials Studio&#174; 6.0 [B] &#8212; that included a significantly\u000a      enhanced QMERA module [A].

Transfer of synchrotron radiation-based techniques to industry has\u000a      been facilitated through Royal Society industrial fellowships, such as the\u000a      secondment of Professor Sankar from UCL to JM between 2007 and 2011.\u000a      During this period, Sankar shared his significant experimental know-how of\u000a      diffraction and synchrotron radiation (SR) techniques with JM research and\u000a      development (R&amp;D), enabling the implementation of these techniques\u000a      across a range of catalysts, from zeolite-based systems to supported oxide\u000a      materials. The introduction of SR techniques at JM has been invaluable\u000a        to the company's catalytic technology and materials processing [C].\u000a      Furthermore, a range of in situ methodologies has been designed\u000a      and developed for JM, which has helped make its analytical science and\u000a      technology highly competitive with other similar chemical companies\u000a      around the world [text removed for publication] [C]. The relationship with\u000a      Sankar has continued through a consultancy arrangement. Alongside this, JM\u000a      has recruited seven UCL\/RI-trained scientists over the last 10\u000a      years; one is now in a senior management role and three were hired in\u000a        the REF impact period. Of the latter group, one is now managing\u000a      projects incorporating modelling, while the other two are full-time\u000a      practitioners [D].\u000a    New product development: Collaborative projects with JM &#8212; for\u000a      example, those described in outputs [3] and [6], above &#8212; have led to\u000a      commercial benefits for the company. Here, work has primarily focused on\u000a      applying the techniques developed by the UCL\/RI team to the field of bulk\u000a      industrial chemical production, particularly in the development of\u000a      inorganic oxides. These are important industrial catalysts used in the\u000a      annual worldwide production of 130 million tonnes of ammonia, 50 million\u000a      tonnes of hydrogen, 60 million tonnes of nitric acid and 100 million\u000a      tonnes of methanol [E]. Catalyst development is a continuous process aimed\u000a      at enhancing operational efficiency and in turn resulting in major\u000a      financial benefits for the end users. Historically, the approach was\u000a      mainly empirical, but new computational and experimental tools have\u000a      provided major opportunities to enhance understanding and suggest new\u000a      avenues for research. Computational modelling, backed by access to\u000a      advanced X-ray techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at\u000a      SR sources, has been applied to a range of doped and defect-containing\u000a      catalytic inorganic oxide materials of relevance to the bulk chemical\u000a      interests of JM (including the former ICI Katalco) [E]. In turn, this work\u000a      has contributed to novel materials design, cost-effective synthesis of\u000a        catalysts and understanding of their application under aggressive\u000a      chemical process conditions [E].

[text removed for publication] the global emission\u000a      control catalyst market reached $6.7 billion in 2012 [C]. These catalysts,\u000a      and platinum-containing systems in particular, were under scrutiny by the\u000a      United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potential source\u000a      of chloroplatinates in the environment [G]. The work was used in 2012 as\u000a      part of the science case that demonstrated that the major industrial use\u000a      of platinum in the catalysts was not a direct source of chloroplatinates;\u000a      in turn, the work recommended a prospective, evidence-based approach to\u000a      both occupational and public exposure assessment to legislators in Europe\u000a      and North America [C].\u000a    \u000a      \u000aTopics in Catalysis 52(8), 924-934 (2009) http:\/\/doi.org\/cd2hgx\u000a\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The development and application, by a UCL and Royal Institution (UCL\/RI)\u000a      team, of a powerful range of computational and experimental techniques has\u000a      had a major impact on understanding of catalysis at the molecular level.\u000a      The translation of these approaches to industry &#8212; achieved through\u000a      fellowships, collaborations and employment of trained UCL\/RI scientists &#8212;\u000a      has had substantial impact on the development and optimisation of key\u000a      catalytic systems used in energy, environmental, bulk and fine chemicals\u000a      production.

The\u000a      aim of this work has been to develop detailed models of catalytic\u000a      structures and processes at the molecular level. The synergistic\u000a      computational and experimental exploration of catalysts has elucidated and\u000a      probed the structures, properties and reactivities of these complex\u000a      materials, helping to develop and direct the design of industrially\u000a      relevant catalysts. The application of both computational models and\u000a      experimental techniques has generated a significant body of work, and the\u000a      UCL\/RI team has published over 500 outputs in the field of catalytic\u000a      science that have provided the underpinning research for industry.\u000a    The computational expertise developed has employed both force field and\u000a      quantum mechanical techniques; for example, in 1996 the ZEBEDDE (ZEolites\u000a      By Evolutionary De novo DEsign) code was developed by UCL\/RI in\u000a      collaboration with the University of Liverpool, primarily to support the\u000a      synthesis and development of microporous materials. This code provides a\u000a      method for the de novo design of template molecules, thus avoiding\u000a      long and exhaustive searches and trial-and-error modifications of known\u000a      templates in order to identify new structure-directing agents [1]. The\u000a      UCL\/RI team was also an integral part of the EU project QUASI (Quantum\u000a      Simulation in Industry) that aimed to encourage and facilitate the\u000a      adoption and implementation of simulation programs. In this project, in\u000a      collaboration with the other project partners, UCL\/RI researchers\u000a      investigated robust QM\/MM (quantum mechanics\/molecular mechanics)\u000a      procedures for modelling active sites and reaction mechanisms in catalytic\u000a      processes, in turn demonstrating the wide applicability of QM\/MM\u000a      procedures to industrial modelling problems [2].\u000a    Complementary to the development and exploitation of advanced\u000a      computational models, the UCL\/RI team concurrently conducted experimental\u000a      research on microporous catalyst structure determination using X-ray\u000a      diffraction (XRD) and absorption spectroscopic (XAS) techniques, employing\u000a      both laboratory and synchrotron radiation sources. In particular, UCL\/RI\u000a      researchers have pioneered the use of powder diffraction and X-ray\u000a      absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) for the simultaneous\u000a      elucidation of local and long-range structure [3, 4]. The combined use of\u000a      these techniques offers a viable, atom-specific analysis of\u000a      non-crystalline gels and crystalline solids when other techniques, such as\u000a      DAFS (diffraction anomalous fine structure), are inapplicable.\u000a      Furthermore, it enables a greater understanding of the formation of, and\u000a      specific environment at, the active sites of microporous catalysts [3, 4].\u000a      Additionally, XAS techniques have been used to assess the environmental\u000a      impact of platinum catalysts [5]. It was found that the use of platinum in\u000a      vehicle emission catalysts is not likely to generate chloroplatinate\u000a      species, which are of environmental concern; rather it was shown that Pt\u000a      is coordinated to oxygen atoms.\u000a    A significant amount of research has been conducted in collaboration with\u000a      industry, in particular with Johnson Matthey. For example, investigations\u000a      into the solubility of metal ions in known catalysts for industrially\u000a      relevant reactions, including the partial oxidation of methane and\u000a      high-temperature catalytic oxidation processes, have been performed [3,\u000a      6]. Such studies are important because the size and morphology of metal\u000a      particles (like Ni and Ce) supported on inorganic oxides impact upon the\u000a      catalytic activity of the material for a specific reaction. A\u000a      comprehensive understanding of how a synthetic route influences the size\u000a      of a metal dopant and its most favourable conformation within a host\u000a      lattice informs on both catalytic performance and lifetime.\u000a    Overall, this combined computational and experimental approach has\u000a      enabled an increasingly detailed understanding at the molecular level of\u000a      the synthesis and catalytic operation of oxide and microporous catalysts.\u000a    Key UCL researchers: Richard Catlow (Professor 1993-present),\u000a      Gopinathan Sankar (Professor, RI 2004-2007; Professor, UCL 2007-present),\u000a      Nora de Leeuw (Reader, Computational Materials Science 2004-2007;\u000a      Professor 2007-present) and Dewi Lewis (Lecturer 1998-2003; Senior\u000a      Lecturer 2003-present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35254","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Public Policy: Air quality and climate change science and policy\u000a      actions have complex linkages.

Heal's\u000a      group (EaStCHEM) has led air pollution research on all three of the most\u000a      important air pollutants; NO2, PM2.5 and O3.\u000a    (A) Measurement of ambient NO2 by passive\u000a        diffusion tube; improved accuracy and quantification of errors\u000a    Measurement of ambient NO2 by passive diffusion tube is widely\u000a      used in the UK as part of air quality assessments required by law. From\u000a      1995 onwards, research led by the Heal group (EaStCHEM) showed that this\u000a      method is subject to inaccuracies, in particular overestimation caused by\u000a      the within-tube reaction between co-diffusing NO and O3 to form\u000a      additional NO2, and an effective shortening of the assumed\u000a      diffusion path length caused by wind turbulence across the entrance of the\u000a      tube. Through field deployments and numerical modelling these biases were\u000a      quantified for locations of varying ambient chemical and meteorological\u000a      conditions.[1,2] Parallel research defined optimal methods for the\u000a      adsorbent preparation and post-exposure chemical analysis.[3] This\u000a      research was initiated in collaboration with Prof. Cape of the NERC Centre\u000a      for Ecology &amp; Hydrology and Honorary EaStCHEM professor but was\u000a      subsequently carried out entirely in the Heal group. The work led to more\u000a      accurate and reliable measurements of atmospheric NO2\u000a      concentration and Heal's methods are now incorporated into protocols\u000a      applied to measurements of NO2 for statutory air quality\u000a      assessments in all urban areas in the UK (estimated &gt;139,000 NO2\u000a      measurements costing &#163;0.5 M annually).[S1]\u000a    (B) Characterisation of sources of airborne particulate matter (PM)\u000a    Research led by the Heal group (EaStCHEM) in 2007-09 quantified the\u000a      proportions of contemporary and fossil carbon in samples of PM2.5\u000a      via accelerator mass spectrometric determination of the carbon-14\u000a      radioisotope. A key finding was that around half the carbon was shown to\u000a      be contemporary rather than fossil, which was higher than anticipated.[4]\u000a      This finding has been important for informing PM2.5 reduction\u000a      policy actions.\u000a    Research carried out in 2012 for the Scottish Environment Protection\u000a      Agency, SEPA, (in collaboration with Dr Vieno from the Centre for Ecology\u000a      &amp; Hydrology) used an atmospheric chemistry transport model to quantify\u000a      the sensitivity of components of PM2.5 in Scotland to\u000a      reductions of primary PM2.5 or gaseous inorganic precursors (SO2,\u000a      NOx, NH3) from industry and shipping within or\u000a      outside of Scotland.[5] A key finding is that reductions in these\u000a      components are most sensitive to reductions in ammonia emissions\u000a      regionally but that the greatest reductions in population exposure are\u000a      achieved nationally by reductions in primary PM2.5 emissions.\u000a      These results are being used by SEPA and the Scottish Government to\u000a      develop policy on reduction of PM2.5 in Scotland.\u000a    (C) Quantification of the current and potential future UK health\u000a        burden from exposure to ambient ozone\u000a    Research led by the Heal group in 2011 used an atmospheric chemistry\u000a      transport model to produce time-series of hourly surface O3\u000a      concentrations at 5 km spatial resolution across the UK for the\u000a      present-day and for possible future scenarios of different precursor\u000a      emissions and increased temperatures from climate change. The O3\u000a      concentrations were used to calculate numbers of regionally-disaggregated\u000a      deaths and hospital admissions that may be attributable to O3\u000a      currently and in the future.[6] The research shows that over a time\u000a      horizon of a few decades policy actions that reduce man-made emissions to\u000a      the atmosphere can have substantially greater health benefits than adverse\u000a      impacts through O3 via climate change but that the O3\u000a      health benefits are extremely sensitive to the exact trends in the\u000a      man-made emissions that are followed.\u000a    People:\u000a    Heal, M.

The 2012\/13 policy\u000a      framework, CFPP-01-01 (Choice Framework for Local Policy Procedures for\u000a      Decontamination) is the code of practice for the management and\u000a      decontamination of surgical instruments that is adopted throughout the\u000a      NHS, as required by the Health and Social Care Act 2008 with regard to NHS\u000a      Decontamination (Sterile Services; Parts E and work acknowledged in Parts\u000a      A and B) facilities.[S1]\u000a    CFPP-01-01 explicitly cites the researchers and describes the studies\u000a      completed by the MIDAS group: Part A, see text on P8, paragraph 2.40\u000a      (section on 'Protein quantification using epifluorescence scanning'), p29,\u000a      paragraph A1 (chapter on 'Inactivation of prions using novel technologies'\u000a      describing 'instrument exposure to cold plasma' and further references on\u000a      p38, paragraph A86. It also cites the report 'ESAC-Pr: New\u000a      Technologies Working Group Report on Prion Inactivating Agents' written by\u000a      the working group (2008), of which R. Baxter is a member.[S2] This report\u000a      includes citations and references to the MIDAS research on pps\u000a      8,20,21,26,27,29.\u000a    2. Health\u000a    MIDAS has extended the technology through research trials currently\u000a      underway with Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Ninewells (Dundee), Glasgow\u000a      Dental Hospital. The consultant microbiologist, leading the work says \"The\u000a        introduction of new detection technology, such as EFSCAN, is essential\u000a        to drive improvements in the standards of decontamination of medical\u000a        instruments throughout the Health Service\".[F1] Data obtained in\u000a      these projects will inform supplements to CFPP-01-01[S1] with regard to\u000a      defining maximum permissible levels of protein contamination on\u000a      reprocessed surgical devices and driving the adoption of new detection\u000a      technology (such as EFSCAN) when commercial systems become available. A\u000a      letter of support from a DoH Senior Principal Research Officer states \"We\u000a        will continue to use the outputs from this study as we develop aspects\u000a        of the CFPP in future and anticipate that successful commercialisation\u000a        of your technology for assessment of instrument decontamination will\u000a        make it available to NHS Trusts for their surgical sterilisation\u000a        departments\".[F2]\u000a    The CONTEST funded research demonstrated the efficacy of the EFSCAN\u000a      technology for both detection and decontamination of material from\u000a      possessions and equipment clean-up after a CBRN incident. In a\u000a      corroborating letter, the DoH CBRN Research Manager states \"There is a\u000a        clear concept of use of the research findings, namely to detect\u000a        contamination and provide clean possessions and other sensitive items in\u000a        the aftermath of a CBRN incident... results from the projects have been\u000a        considered at an operational level at the Home Office\".[F3]\u000a    3. Economic: commercialisation of EFSCAN for detection of\u000a        contamination\u000a    Through Edinburgh Research Innovation, MIDAS exploited the IP developed\u000a      in the 2002-8 research. Working with Edinburgh Biosciences, a\u000a      proof-of-concept EFSCAN instrument for hospital Sterile Services\u000a      Departments use was constructed in 2011-12. In early 2013, Edinburgh\u000a      BioSciences was awarded a SMART:SCOTLAND grant of &#163;100k by Scottish\u000a      Enterprise to develop and bring the EFSCAN system to market by the end of\u000a      2013. Edinburgh Biosciences UK has four salaried people now developing the\u000a      EFSCAN proof-of-concept design into commercial prototypes for manufacture\u000a      and marketing. Two are PhD level engineers, one Masters (mechanical\u000a      engineering); and an electronic engineer (honours degree). The Edinburgh\u000a      Biosciences CEO said \"Following the successful development of a\u000a        proof-of-concept instrument, Edinburgh Biosciences Ltd. sees commercial\u000a        exploitation of this instrument as a key element of its business launch\u000a        plan. As the reliability and performance characteristics of the system\u000a        are confirmed, marketing and sales of the instrument will expand\u000a        internationally from a UK base. The US is a target market given that\u000a        awareness of the problems of contamination of surgical instruments is\u000a        already in the public domain\".[F4]\u000a    A portable `hand-held' fluorescence detector for fast detection of\u000a      biomolecules on surfaces, in the context of homeland security, has also\u000a      been developed.\u000a    The press (Telegraph, Guardian, Scotsman newspaper articles; BBC News and\u000a      radio, and specialist publications) note the value to public and the\u000a      profession, and cite MIDAS's work directly.

They developed a new epifluorescence\u000a      scanning technique, EFSCAN, to measure these fluorescent, labelled\u000a      residues, pushing the level of detection of proteins on surfaces down to ca.\u000a      100 attomoles mm-2 [2] The new technique was fast and\u000a      quantitative, and exceeded the sensitivity of the commonly used ninhydrin\u000a      swab test by more than 5 orders of magnitude, and was patented.[5]\u000a    In parallel, the group developed RF gas-plasma methods for direct\u000a      oxidation and elimination of proteins, including transmissible spongiform\u000a      encephalopathy (TSE) infective tissue, from metal surfaces of medical\u000a      instruments.[3] Recognising that this method is capable of eliminating the\u000a      risk of iatrogenic CJD transmission between patients by surgery, this RF\u000a      method was patented.[6]\u000a    The proven combination of gas plasma removal, and epifluorescence\u000a      scanning to confirm decontamination,[4] led to the work with Edinburgh\u000a      BioSciences to develop EFSCAN technology into a device.\u000a    Two further research projects were initiated in 2008 arising from funding\u000a      from CONTEST, the UK Government's counter-terrorism strategy program on\u000a      the detection and decontamination of toxins and biological agents:\u000a      `High-Level Decontamination using RF Gas-Plasma' and `Ultra-sensitive\u000a      Detection of Specific Biomolecules on Surfaces'.

The value of sales for 2008-July 2013 is\u000a      &#163;3M. [F1]\u000a    b. Provision of process development and bioprocess optimisation for\u000a        other industries The enabling technologies developed in Section 2\u000a      are being used much more broadly by Ingenza for bioprocess optimisation\u000a      and supply of improved production microbes, to provide large industries\u000a      with new, sustainable manufacturing processes from renewable rather than\u000a      petrochemical feedstocks. For example, multi-year partnerships have been\u000a      established with leading global companies, such as Lucite International,\u000a      the world's leading manufacturer of poly-methylmethacrylate [S3]. Ingenza\u000a      piloted one of its improved biofuel strains with another end-user in the\u000a      US at full production scale of 2.4 million litres; the Ingenza President\u000a      can provide information on the number and range of other companies that\u000a      have benefitted. A major two-year development programme employing five\u000a      people at Ingenza to work with Invista, one of the world's largest\u000a      integrated producers of polymers and fibres (10,000 employees in 20\u000a      countries), has also just completed successfully, with ten people starting\u000a      on this project in the near future as a result of the expansion of the\u000a      project. The Ingenza President can provide corroboration on this [F1]. The\u000a      President of Invista is quoted in the most recent press announcement \"We\u000a        see Ingenza's capabilities as very complementary to our own and are\u000a        pleased to announce this extended collaboration.\" [S4]\u000a    In a corroborating letter, the co-founder of Ingenza, who recently moved\u000a      to Australia to be involved in new biotechnology start-up initiatives\u000a      writes \"The deracemisation research and the interest that was\u000a        generated by the high impact publications in Nick Turner's group was\u000a        really the foundation of Ingenza ... and the interest that was generated\u000a        by the high impact publications. As well as the research, the School of\u000a        Chemistry really supported Ingenza in those first few years in an\u000a        operational sense and that support was key to starting the company on a\u000a        strong footing...The ongoing relationship with the School of Chemistry\u000a        has also been important for Ingenza... The international impact of the\u000a        published research from Prof Turner's lab meant that Ingenza had a\u000a        standing on the world stage from day one to the present day, with the\u000a        majority of company's business coming from abroad.\" [F2]\u000a    Human Capital:\u000a    Ingenza's scientific team spans the disciplines of molecular biology,\u000a      biochemistry, enzymology, fermentation science and synthetic organic\u000a      chemistry, and has recruited and trained numerous scientists, including 12\u000a      scientists trained to PhD or post-doctoral level at Edinburgh University.\u000a      Currently 34 staff are employed, 12 of whom have PhDs.[F1]\u000a    There is also strong R+D collaboration with EaStCHEM staff, with joint\u000a      awards from TSB, SPARK, ERA-NET, and collaborative PhD students. Ingenza\u000a      has engaged with the Government's Modern apprentice scheme since 2009,\u000a      winning 'Small Employer of the Year 2011' at the Scottish Modern\u000a      Apprenticeship Awards.[S4] In 2012 Scottish Minister for Youth Employment,\u000a      said \"I commend Ingenza for their forward thinking approach in\u000a        fostering a new generation of young scientists, and offering up some\u000a        excellent opportunities for training in this exciting sector\".[S5]\u000a    Impact Development Timeline:\u000a    2002 First paper and patent; Ingenza launched and incubated within\u000a      School of Chemistry.[F1]\u000a    2003 The Edinburgh (University) technology fund invested &#163;25,000\u000a      in Ingenza for a 5% stake; Ingenza won &#163;120,000 funding from the Scottish\u000a      Executive, Scottish Enterprise and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\u000a    2005 Scottish Enterprise helped Ingenza with direct funding\u000a      (&#163;20,000) to offset costs of new business development.

They extended this to a range of amino acids using\u000a      commercially available oxidase enzymes.[2]\u000a    Another key advance was the use of cloned microbial genes and the\u000a      development of in-vitro evolution of enzymes. Working in collaboration\u000a      with GSK, an enzyme from a gene maoN that oxidised simple\u000a      aliphatic amines was identified that showed a clear preference for the\u000a      oxidation of L-&#945;-methylbenzylamine over D-&#945;-methylbenzylamine. The group\u000a      optimised this using random mutagenesis and in vitro and in\u000a        situ selection, and colorimetric solid phase screening, to generate\u000a      new biocatalysts and commercially important targets (starting with chiral\u000a      amines) of interest to pharmaceutical industry customers.[3]\u000a    The Turner group recognised three key points of the new method that led\u000a      them to protect the work [6] and then spin-out Ingenza: (i). The high\u000a      selectivity of an enzyme allows enantiomeric excesses of &gt;99.9 %. (ii)\u000a      It converts all the potential substrate into the desired enantiomer\u000a      product, compared with a standard enzyme-catalysed kinetic resolution of a\u000a      chiral racemate. (iii). It does not require the harsh conditions required\u000a      to racemise amines that alternative transition-metal catalyst routes to\u000a      develop dynamic kinetic resolutions have.\u000a    Further UoE research to develop high throughput screening techniques [4]\u000a      enabled a large number of solid phase screening capabilities to address\u000a      problems faced by the biopharma industry. For example, novel screen\u000a      calibration approaches allowed the development of colorimetric oxidase\u000a      based protein fusion systems to identify the top 50 out of a\u000a      500,000-member library of candidates for a key therapeutic target.[5]\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a    Prof Nick Turner, EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh\u000a      10\/1998-09\/2004.

Due to the founding role of\u000a      DNA and RNA molecules in all cellular processes, their transport into\u000a      cells is restricted by the cell membrane. Many different physical,\u000a      chemical and biological approaches have been explored for the cell\u000a      delivery of nucleic acids, with viral vectors being the most efficient one\u000a      both therapeutically or as a research-enabling tool. However, due to the\u000a      limitations of viral agents (antigenicity, risk of mutagenesis, production\u000a      costs, etc.), chemical delivery systems represent an attractive\u000a      alternative but have serious toxicity issues. Most chemical transfection\u000a      technologies are based on the use of large surfactants \/ polycationic\u000a      molecules with the ability to complex nucleic acids into liposome-like\u000a      particles and carry them into cells via endocytosis.\u000a    Research Following their move to EaStCHEM in 2005, the Bradley\u000a      group attracted significant support from the MRC and EPSRC (2005-2008\u000a      &amp; 2009-2012) as well as from Scottish Enterprise (2008-2010), to\u000a      develop non-toxic cationic lipids and dendrimers as DNA\/RNA carriers [1].\u000a      In early development work, two families of transfection reagents, based on\u000a      the rational assembly of naturally-occurring components such as amino\u000a      acids, lipids and non-toxic linkers stood out.[2,3]\u000a    This novel non-viral chemical approach offered a highly-efficient and non-toxic\u000a      method to:\u000a    a. Deliver nucleic acids (siRNA\/DNA) to a wide range of\u000a        mammalian cell lines and tissues that cannot be transfected without\u000a      toxicity by existing commercial non-viral materials such as embryonic stem\u000a      cells.\u000a    b. Deliver gene therapy drugs with high efficiency, e.g. for the\u000a      delivery of RNAi-based therapeutics, an emerging application within the\u000a      Bio-Pharmaceutical sector. Gene therapy drugs have not yet been approved\u000a      in Europe or USA because of lack of safety and efficiency; however the\u000a      in-built degradation propensity of these reagents confers upon them the\u000a      ability to metabolize into natural products and enhance nucleic acid\u000a      release within the cell thus improving the delivery process.\u000a    For the latter, preliminary in vivo assays demonstrated the\u000a      ability of compounds to transfect mouse lung with no obvious signs of\u000a      toxicity, attracting early interest from major market players such as\u000a      Merck and Silence Therapeutics Plc. Therapeutic relevance for this is for\u000a      genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis (annual treatment cost per\u000a      patient up to &#163;160,000, 9000 sufferers in the UK, 40,000 in the US) and\u000a      viral infections such as influenza (annual cost to the US economy up to\u000a      &#163;110bn, based on average 200,000 hospitalisations and 41,000 deaths).\u000a    The new series of biodegradable delivery reagents were patented in 2007\u000a      [5] and the spin-out company Deliverics Ltd created in 2010 for\u000a      their commercialization. Preliminary in vivo assays demonstrated\u000a      their ability to transfect DNA plasmids into mouse lung [2]. Improved in\u000a        vivo biodegradable reagents were then developed in the Bradley group\u000a      [3,4] and patented in 2010.[6] Their subsequent research and development\u000a      led to water-based formulations (SAFEctinTM product series)\u000a      that allow a one-step `mix &amp; go' procedure. Ongoing research shows\u000a      outstanding transfection performance including with difficult-to-transfect\u000a      and sensitive cells. Additional in vivo assays have demonstrated\u000a      their ability to transfect siRNA and miRNA in mouse lung and skin\u000a      xerographs (unpublished data by Deliverics) with no signs of toxicity.\u000a    The unique selling points that distinguish the reagents from existing\u000a      platforms, and have allowed the research commercialisation are:\u000a    in vitro\u000a    \u000a      High efficiency transfection (comparable\/better than gold-standard\u000a        commercial products, Lipofectamine2000 and Effectene) in a variety of\u000a        mammalian cells, including stem cells.\u000a      Non-toxic.\u000a      Ease of use (no requirement for later removal, enabling a simple,\u000a        one-step protocol).\u000a    \u000a    in vivo\u000a    \u000a      Cationic lipids specifically designed to be metabolised in vivo\u000a        rendering them non-toxic and safe for clinical applications (e.g.\u000a        multiple dosing).\u000a      The combination of reduced toxicity and increased transfection\u000a        efficiency makes the compounds particularly amenable for in-vivo\u000a        application.\u000a    \u000a    Additionally, they do not incur the expensive and difficult 'Good\u000a      Manufacturing Process' requirements of viral production.\u000a    Key people who led the research\u000a    Professor Mark Bradley 2005 to date (EaStCHEM); Dr A.

Economic Impact. The concepts described in the research above\u000d\u000a      have had significant impact on a number of different areas of lithium\u000d\u000a      battery technology but in particular it has impacted on the development of\u000d\u000a      2nd generation rechargeable Li-ion batteries produced by all\u000d\u000a      the major battery manufacturers globally, [text removed for\u000d\u000a        publication].\u000d\u000a    The discovery and synthesis of layered LiMnO2 (LMO) as a\u000d\u000a      positive electrode for lithium batteries [text removed for\u000d\u000a        publication] to reduce cost and improve safety. These materials are\u000d\u000a      manufactured worldwide, as are the batteries that use them as positive\u000d\u000a      electrodes. The value of the lithium battery market is estimated at $12\u000d\u000a      billion per annum (approx. 4 billion cells) and the Mn based share at ~40%\u000d\u000a      [S6].

However, it is the\u000d\u000a      general concept that has had the most impact. The wealth of possible\u000d\u000a      combinations of elements in mixed metal Li(Mn1-xMx)O2\u000d\u000a      materials means that each company has developed their own particular\u000d\u000a      electrode. [text removed for publication].\u000d\u000a    The director of LIB Battery Consultants LTD, writes that Peter Bruce's\u000d\u000a      work on \"...manganese-based lithium oxides has made a major impact in\u000d\u000a        the field. His work on the spinel materials laid the foundations for\u000d\u000a        their later use as cathodes in lithium ion batteries for automotive\u000d\u000a        applications, for example in the Nissan leaf and Vauxhall Ampera.\"\u000d\u000a      [Reference S1]\u000d\u000a    II. The hierarchical approach to lithium-ion battery electrode design,\u000d\u000a      combining, nano and micron scales, demonstrated by Bruce, is being\u000d\u000a      exploited in the fabrication of titanate anodes for lithiumion batteries [text\u000d\u000a        removed for publication]. The advantage is that the batteries can be\u000d\u000a      safely charged and discharged at higher rates than traditional lithium-ion\u000d\u000a      batteries, because the nanostructure enhances the charge\/discharge rates,\u000d\u000a      while the hierarchical structure ensures that the electrode is more dense\u000d\u000a      than a simple powder of nanoparticles, thus delivering high volumetric\u000d\u000a      capacity. Nanostructured lithium titanate batteries account for only a\u000d\u000a      small percentage of the total lithium battery market as yet, but their\u000d\u000a      market share is predicted to increase over the next ten years\u000d\u000a      substantially.\u000d\u000a    III. The theoretical energy density (storage) of the lithium-air battery\u000d\u000a      is 10 times greater than lithium-ion batteries of today and greater than\u000d\u000a      Li-ion batteries can ever achieve. As such, lithium-air could deliver the\u000d\u000a      Holy Grail in the automotive industry of an electric vehicle with a 500km\u000d\u000a      driving range. Bruce's pioneering studies in 2006 led directly to an\u000d\u000a      explosion of interest in the Li-air battery, not only in academic research\u000d\u000a      but also within industry. The major current impact (2009 onwards) of this\u000d\u000a      relatively recent research advance is on companies, who are actively\u000d\u000a      developing the concepts behind the lithium-air battery. The Economist [See\u000d\u000a      reference S2] reported that the advances \"..that Dr Bruce's team has\u000d\u000a        designed can be a mere one-eighth to one-tenth the size and weight of\u000d\u000a        modern batteries, while still carrying the same charge. Making such a\u000d\u000a        battery is also expected to be cheaper. Lithium cobalt oxide accounts\u000d\u000a        for 30% of the cost of a lithium-ion battery. Air, however, is free.\"\u000d\u000a      Since then major automotive companies around the world are pursuing the\u000d\u000a      technology. Examples of companies developing the Li-air battery are, IBM,\u000d\u000a      Toyota\/BMW, CEA (France), BASF\/Bosch Germany, Volkswagen, Samsung. IBM has\u000d\u000a      announced they will demonstrate a prototype in 2014, [See corroborative\u000d\u000a      references S5, S9].\u000d\u000a    B. Policy Impact\u000d\u000a    A significant role as advocate and advisor to industry and Government has\u000d\u000a      arisen from the research on lithium batteries at St Andrews. Bruce has\u000d\u000a      appeared before a Parliamentary Select Committee. Importantly, Bruce\u000d\u000a      Chaired a Royal Society of Chemistry committee that produced a report on\u000d\u000a      Energy Storage, [text removed for publication].\u000d\u000a    C. Societal Impact\u000d\u000a    Lithium batteries have become firmly entrenched in consumer goods over\u000d\u000a      the last decade. As such the impact of the fundamental research described\u000d\u000a      above and its subsequent exploitation has played an important part in the\u000d\u000a      impact of 2nd generation lithium batteries on society across\u000d\u000a      the world. For the LMO battery technology the impact has allowed safer\u000d\u000a      power tools and medical device batteries, and nanostructured electrode\u000d\u000a      batteries are breaking into the electric vehicle market.

They combine\u000a      biological activity, low toxicity and high selectivity. But they are\u000a      expensive. While solid-phase\u000a      peptide synthesis was already a routine procedure, the cumulative outcome\u000a      of sub-100% yields for\u000a      each of many steps in the process had limited the length of peptides that\u000a      could be produced and\u000a      purified in useful quantities to &lt; 50-60 amino acid residues. Most\u000a      biologically or clinically interesting\u000a      proteins are bigger. Furthermore, many proteins of interest to\u000a      biotechnology and pharmaceutical\u000a      companies contain disulfide bonds, creating additional challenges for\u000a      synthesis.\u000a    Professor Robert Ramage, FRS, of EaStCHEM recognised an unmet need for\u000a      total protein\u000a      synthesis using solid-phase chemistry as a versatile alternative to\u000a      recombinant gene expression.\u000a      From 1993-5 the Ramage group published, [1, 2] and patented [6] new\u000a      solid-phase and protecting\u000a      group methodologies for peptide synthesis. The work allowed the total\u000a      synthesis of hitherto\u000a      inaccessible long polypeptides. He demonstrated the usefulness of these\u000a      techniques by\u000a      manufacturing biologically active proteins that provided detailed insights\u000a      into structure-function\u000a      relationships.[3-5]\u000a    Ramage recognised that resolution of the product from acetylated\u000a      truncated peptides was key. He\u000a      researched methods for derivatising the peptide N terminus with a\u000a      removable tag for affinity\u000a      purification on a solid support. He introduced the base-labile\u000a      N(f061)-protecting group,\u000a      tetrabenzo[a,c,g,i]fluorenyl-17-methoxycarbonyl (Tbfmoc) for affinity\u000a      purification on porous\u000a      graphitised carbon.[1,2] In a key paper, he described a convenient\u000a      synthesis of Tbfmoc and its\u000a      application to the production of proteins containing up to 85 amino acids.\u000a      The hydrophobicity of\u000a      Tbfmoc was further exploited to simplify peptide purification by\u000a      reverse-phase HPLC. The Ramage\u000a      group showed that Tbfmoc could be added directly to the N terminus rather\u000a      than being\u000a      incorporated as a Tbfmoc-Gly(cine)-OH. Thus, crucially, any peptide could\u000a      be made with retention\u000a      of its native N-terminal residue. This discovery was patented (US Patent\u000a      No: 6,566,520, 2003) [6]\u000a      and paved the way for the spin out of Albachem (1994). The University\u000a      supported Albachem by\u000a      contributing infrastructure, funding, collaborations and technical\u000a      assistance to transfer crucial\u000a      knowhow from academia into the commercial environment. Albachem remained\u000a      within the\u000a      University until 2002.\u000a    The utility of Tbfmoc was dramatically demonstrated in the production of\u000a      a biologically active\u000a      cytokine (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, MCP-1). This contained 76\u000a      residues and two\u000a      disulfide bonds.[4] Critically, Tbfmoc was removable under mild\u000a      conditions, preserving the nascent\u000a      protein product in a reduced state (-SH). Subsequent oxidative folding\u000a      yielded the correct disulfide\u000a      pattern and fully active cytokine. Albachem thus demonstrated to the world\u000a      its capability of\u000a      producing large quantities of purified cell-signaling proteins. This\u000a      established its credentials as a\u000a      world-leader. Cumulatively, the 1993, 1995 and 1996 papers underpinned\u000a      Albachem's\u000a      establishment, subsequent growth and assimilation into CSS that later\u000a      became the Almac group.\u000a    The Ramage group's work expanded protein therapeutics by facilitating\u000a      access to multiple-gram\u000a      quantities of material suitable for use in laboratories, animal models and\u000a      humans. Future\u000a      prospects are exciting. Routine recombinant methods for protein\u000a      production, besides being\u000a      expensive, provide little flexibility for new developments because the\u000a      building blocks are\u000a      constrained to genetically encoded amino acids. No such limitations apply\u000a      to synthetic proteins of\u000a      the kind accessible via strategies based on Tbfmoc and its\u000a      successors that can incorporate a vast\u000a      range of chemistries.\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a    R.

Almost all academic staff\u000a      have an accessible talk on their research suitable for a range of\u000a      audiences. Public lectures introduce audiences to the fundamental ideas of\u000a      chemistry in engaging ways, in an effort to reduce the marginalisation of\u000a      chemistry within society and promote general public interest in chemistry.\u000a      UCL researchers' ability to engage non-specialist audiences in their\u000a      research has led to further invitations to present on chemistry more\u000a      broadly.\u000a    Promotion of chemistry to school pupils: The department has been\u000a      extensively involved in The Training Partnership's A-level student lecture\u000a      programme. Since 2008, 15 sell-out lectures, on topics such as atmospheric\u000a      and ice chemistry, have been given to nearly 14,000 pupils (underpinned\u000a      by, for example, outputs 1,2,5). The Training Partnership said: \"The\u000a        fact that UCL speakers have taken part on several, and in numerous cases\u000a        many, occasions indicates a high level of approval from students and\u000a        teachers... [The] chemistry department has performed a service of\u000a        inestimable value not just to chemistry but ultimately to developing the\u000a        nation's skill base and potential for knowledge-driven growth.\" [a]\u000a    The Chemistry Department regularly holds lectures for schools attracting\u000a      400 pupils per year from more than 45 schools. Since 2008, this series has\u000a      included lectures to inform pupils about its research on atmospheric\u000a      chemistry (Rowley, output 5), nanomaterials (e.g. output 9), and materials\u000a      design and prediction (Catlow, Lewis, output 6). Eight schools have found\u000a      the talks so useful that they have attended more than four lectures. Talks\u000a      have also regularly been delivered to A-level students through the UCL\u000a      Science Centre, with 16 such talks each delivered to between 300-500\u000a      students in the REF period. Talks to individual schools, often\u000a      demonstration lectures, are increasingly done by postgraduate students\u000a      speaking about research in their supervisor's area. This provides pupils\u000a      with the chance to talk to real researchers of a similar age to their own.\u000a    The department's success in introducing its research in schools led to\u000a      invitations to present on chemistry as a wider subject. For example,\u000a      Sella's lecture, \"How the Zebra got its Stripes\", about the crucial role\u000a      of chemical feedback mechanisms in natural pattern formation that also\u000a      asks profound questions about faith, has been given to over 38,000 GCSE\u000a      students at 26 GCSE ScienceLive events held since December 2008. GCSE\u000a      ScienceLive, which takes place across the UK, is a day-long event\u000a      consisting of talks from the country's most prestigious scientists to\u000a      inspire GCSE students to continue to study science. Participant feedback\u000a      includes: \"Before I had attended Science Live I had only chosen to\u000a        attend for the chance to miss a day of school (...) I also had no idea\u000a        what career path I was going to choose. But after your words on why I\u000a        should become a scientist (which shook my religious beliefs, which I\u000a        adhere [to] with conviction) I've decided that you are right, and\u000a        consequently for work experience placements I am visiting both Norwich\u000a        University Hospital and hopefully something else science-related. Thank\u000a        you so, so much.\" [b]\u000a    Stimulation of public interest and engagement in science: Sella\u000a      has spearheaded much of the outreach work, with the EPSRC awards\u000a      specifically enabling him to promote chemistry and establish himself as\u000a      the UK's foremost public exponent of chemistry. The success of Sella's\u000a      fellowship is highlighted by an article in New Scientist: \"It has often\u000a      been said that chemistry needs a champion in the mould of Brian Cox or\u000a      Richard Dawkins. That is starting to happen with the arrival of such\u000a      popularisers as Andrea\u000a        Sella of University College London\" [n]. As a result, he has not\u000a      simply presented science directly related to his own research (e.g. a\u000a      video on didymium, which is composed of rare earth metals, has been\u000a      watched over 21,000 times since December 2012 [c]), but because of this\u000a      underpinning research he has also been instrumental in bringing a broad\u000a      range of the department's chemistry to a wider audience, through regular\u000a      radio and TV appearances.\u000a    The department's research on thermodynamic properties of matter including\u000a      phase diagrams [output 4] led to Sella contributing to BBC Four's The\u000a        Secret Life of Ice in October 2011, which had 0.47m viewers in the\u000a      UK [j]. It also aired in 8 countries, including the USA, Canada and\u000a      Australia, helping promote chemistry among a global public audience. In\u000a      late 2012, this contribution was developed into a demonstration lecture\u000a      called Strange Ice, which has been delivered to 2,700 sixth-form\u000a      pupils through the Training Partnership's \"Chemistry in Action\" events,\u000a      and audiences at Cambridge, Cheltenham and Edinburgh Science festivals.\u000a      The Training Partnership stated \"the feedback on the most recent UCL\u000a      presenter, Sella in autumn 2012 and spring 2013 for `Strange Ice', ranged\u000a      from `outstanding' to `motivating' and `exceptional'\" [a].\u000a    The platform created by presenting departmental research, combined with\u000a      Sella's ability to translate complex subjects for the public, led to\u000a      repeat invitations to act as consultant and contributor on major\u000a      television and radio productions. This has included ongoing collaboration\u000a      with, among others, the BBC. For example, he acted as consultant and\u000a      recorded demonstrations for the award-winning documentary The Secret\u000a        Life of Chaos, again utilising his expertise in thermodynamics\u000a      [output 4], presented by Jim Al-Khalili and first broadcast on BBC Four in\u000a      Jan 2010 (0.53m viewers [j]). The programme won the Best Film prize at the\u000a      International Science Film Festival 2010 and the Association of British\u000a      Science Writers' best scripted television programme award [d]. A senior\u000a      BBC producer confirms Sella's important contribution to programmes across\u000a      the entire spectrum of BBC broadcasting: \"He is terrific at translating\u000a      the complex and intangible into focused, accessible information which can\u000a      be incorporated into science programmes to make them multi-textured,\u000a      fascinating and entertaining to a wide variety of audiences.\" [i]\u000a    Sella also contributed to and appeared on the BBC Four 3-part series Chemistry:\u000a        A Volatile History in January 2010, which he ensured contained an\u000a      appropriate mixture of historical context and scientific rigour. This\u000a      series holds the record for the highest audience of any science series on\u000a      BBC Four and was consistently one of the channel's top 2 broadcasts\u000a      throughout the series, demonstrating that the public engaged with the\u000a      topic (0.74m viewers tuned in to the first episode) [j]. It was nominated\u000a      for a 2010 Specialist Factual BAFTA [h]. It also aired in the USA. Online\u000a      comments were positive, including: \"I learnt more in these 4 viewings\u000a        than during 3 years of weekly chemistry lessons at college\"; \"Superb.\u000a        The opening episode of this series was simply excellent, with an\u000a        engaging presenter, well demonstrated experiments and evocative\u000a        locations\", and \"If only all chemistry lessons were this good at\u000a        school, we'd all become scientists\" [f]. His other work has included\u000a      contributions to the BBC Four 2-part series Everything and Nothing\u000a      (March 2011, 0.43m viewers); the 3-part Science and Islam (Jan\u000a      2009, up to 0.42m viewers per episode); the BBC Two 6-parter The Story\u000a        of Science: Power, Proof and Passion (May 2010, 1.56-2.25m viewers\u000a      per episode); and Channel 4's Heston's Tudor Feast (March 2009,\u000a      2.6m viewers) [j]. A BBC presenter noted that without Sella's\u000a      \"fundamental\" input, many science series \"wouldn't make it to screen\" and\u000a      was a crucial source for promoting science to young children: without it,\u000a      \"there would be little chemistry and much smaller audiences on [CBBC]\"\u000a      [o].\u000a    Presentations to general audiences: Sella's engagement activities\u000a      extend beyond his media outreach, with talks to the general public, such\u000a      as contributions to the Cheltenham Science Festival. Between 2008 and\u000a      2013, he delivered 24 presentations and 4 discussions to audiences of up\u000a      to 600 members of the public per session. These talks consistently drew on\u000a      departmental research; for example he curated a discussion between Dr\u000a      Lewis and architect Magnus Larsson to draw attention to the parallels\u000a      between deliberate design of porous structures such as zeolites and the\u000a      design of large-scale structures in which bacteria transform sand into\u000a      sandstone. He brought superhydrophobic surfaces [output 8], supercooled\u000a      water [outputs 1,2], phase diagrams and high- pressure science [output 4]\u000a      to this and other Science Festivals, as part of presentations including\u000a      the Overambitious Demo Challenge, Molecular Mastery, The Science of\u000a        Cocktails, and Mercury: Window on the Invisible. His talk Chemistry\u000a        and Architecture was underpinned by Catlow and Lewis's work into\u000a      computer-aided materials design [output 6]. A Festival organiser confirms\u000a      that Sella's events \"all received good feedback from members of the\u000a      audience... The comments included how enthusiastic Andrea is and how it\u000a      has motivated them to learn more or increased their understanding of the\u000a      topic. The style of his events, which often include demonstrations, also\u000a      helps to draw in audiences that might not want to attend debate or lecture\u000a      style events\" [g].\u000a    Since 2009 UCL researchers have been involved in Bright Club, a monthly\u000a      comedy event based on the participants' research (including the work of\u000a      Rowley and Parkin), run by the UCL Public Engagement Unit. Bright Club\u000a      brings researchers to a new audience: 20-50 year olds who have no existing\u000a      relationship with academia. The reach of these events is increased further\u000a      by free podcasts available on iTunes. Sella has also played an important\u000a      part in the science-based comedy event Festival of the Spoken Nerd\u000a      (FoTSN), performing to over 1,200 people over the past three years. One of\u000a      the organisers of FoTSN says: \"The chemistry demos are without a doubt the\u000a      most talked-about part of the show on the night, on social media, and for\u000a      days afterwards.\" [e]\u000a    Online outreach activities: The department has also undertaken a\u000a      number of online activities to engage the public with its research,\u000a      helping reach a far wider, international audience. For example, a 2009\u000a      collaboration with Sciencefilms and Labreporter led to the development of\u000a      six \"Lab Report\" short videos on CVD, atmospheric chemistry and\u000a      carbon-carbon bonds. These videos were posted on YouTube and had, as of 31\u000a      July 2013, been viewed some 25,000 times [m]. Meanwhile, Hirjibehedin\u000a      instituted a citizens' science project titled Feynman's Flowers,\u000a      which uses online participatory methods to educate the public about\u000a      molecular spintronics; the project webpage received around 1,800 unique\u000a      visitor hits from almost 80 countries since Sept 2012 [k].\u000a    The interfaces, catalytic and environmental group's exhibit on the\u000a      properties of water at the nanoscale, at the 2010 Royal Society Summer\u000a      Science Exhibition, included a free iPhone game called Waterfall that\u000a      users in 73 countries downloaded 4,265 times. During the impact period,\u000a      the 25+ videos on the group's YouTube channel were collectively viewed\u000a      110,000 times [l].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The UCL Department of Chemistry has for many years run a far-reaching\u000a      programme of outreach and public engagement that has deep roots in the\u000a      department's research programme.

Since 2006, researchers have used concepts from quantum to\u000a      statistical mechanics to apply and develop methods and computer\u000a      simulations to study, for instance, chemical reactions at surfaces and\u000a      processes of environmental relevance. Much of this research is carried out\u000a      with leading experimentalists across the world, and in recent years water\u000a      and ice have been a major focus of the work. Breakthroughs in this area\u000a      include the discovery of the first extended ice-like structure built\u000a      exclusively from water pentagons (in collaboration with colleagues at the\u000a      University of Liverpool) [1], and theoretical studies of new phases of ice\u000a      [2].\u000a    Professor Sella (Professor of Chemistry, at UCL since 1990) has worked on\u000a      the synthesis of molecular rare earth complexes and their electronic\u000a      structure [3]. His expertise in synthesis of air sensitive complexes has\u000a      led to collaborative projects with Professor McMillan on tetrelide systems\u000a      and their behaviour under high pressure. These systems have led to the\u000a      preparation of amorphous phases of the group 4 elements, work that has\u000a      uncovered superconductivity in germanium at high pressure [4]. For this,\u000a      the synthesis and initial high-pressure studies were carried out at UCL,\u000a      with the measurement of conductivity done by collaborators in Russia. In\u000a      2007, Sella was awarded an EPSRC Senior Media Fellowship &#8212; awarded to\u000a      enable leading academic researchers to advance public engagement with the\u000a      physical science &#8212; to be a champion for chemistry nationally, with a focus\u000a      on energy issues; this was extended in 2010.\u000a    Another aspect of UCL's research, led by Dr Rowley (Senior Lecturer)\u000a      since 1998, has focused on studying fundamental gas phase free radical\u000a      reactions. These reactions have potential impact on atmospheric\u000a      composition and therefore environmental effects including ozone depletion,\u000a      air quality and global warming. Specifically, reactions of peroxy radicals\u000a      and the unexpected effects of water vapour on reactions of these species\u000a      have been elucidated, giving a better description of atmospheric oxidation\u000a      and therefore pollutant removal mechanisms [5]. In addition, reactions of\u000a      chlorine and bromine monoxide species have been characterised, which has\u000a      led to a better quantitative understanding of halogen mediated atmospheric\u000a      ozone loss.\u000a    The work of Professor Catlow and Dr Lewis [6] uses computational methods\u000a      to understand the structure and synthesis of complex materials, and to\u000a      subsequently synthesise new materials with specific properties. The\u000a      research covers a range of solids with application as catalysts, sensors\u000a      and ceramics; the present focus is on microporous materials.\u000a    Dr Hirjibehedin's research at UCL since 2007 centres on understanding the\u000a      electronic and magnetic properties of nanoscale structures. It explores\u000a      how they might be used to make the smallest possible devices for\u000a      information processing, data storage, and sensing using low-temperature\u000a      scanning tunnelling microscopes [7]. STM is used to image individual atoms\u000a      and molecules on surfaces; to probe structural, electronic, and magnetic\u000a      properties; and even to arrange atoms and molecules into new\u000a      configurations.\u000a    Further research on the structure of surfaces has established a new scale\u000a      of superhydrophobicity. This is based simply upon the number of times\u000a      water droplets bounce on the surface which is dependent on the surfaces\u000a      microstructure [8]. Work has also focused on the use of CVD to create TiO2\u000a      layers doped with nano-particles for photocatalytic water reduction and\u000a      oxidation [9].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37314","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This very recent work has informed the public about the scientific basis\u000d\u000a      of the reported activity of peptide-based skincare treatments, with high\u000d\u000a      levels of media coverage stimulating public interest and awareness of the\u000d\u000a      underpinning science.

Matrixyl is an ingredient found in a number of\u000d\u000a      commercial face-creams and Hamley's group has demonstrated its ability to\u000d\u000a      increase the amount of collagen produced by fibroblasts &#8212; cells found in\u000d\u000a      connective tissues such as skin &#8212; by 70%. Collagen is the principal\u000d\u000a      protein that contributes to the strength and elasticity of skin.\u000d\u000a    While Hamley's research on C16-KTTKS has inherent implications\u000d\u000a      for skin-care products, his primary interest is in the development of next\u000d\u000a      generation biomaterials for assisting wound healing and regenerative\u000d\u000a      medicine, focusing on strategies to increase production of collagen, the\u000d\u000a      main structural protein in mammalian connective tissue. The peptide KTTKS\u000d\u000a      has been previously shown to promote and stimulate collagen production. In\u000d\u000a      2000, a French biotechnology company (Sederma) added a 16-carbon lipid\u000d\u000a      chain to KTTKS to confer enhanced stability in vivo, and thus increase its\u000d\u000a      bioavailability by increasing resistance to enzymatic degradation. This lipopeptide\u000d\u000a      or peptide amphiphile, (PA) C16KTTKS, was registered\u000d\u000a      under the trade name Matrixyl.\u000d\u000a    Investigating the nanostructure of Matrixyl\u000d\u000a      The way in which molecules of Matrixyl-like peptides aggregate depends\u000d\u000a      upon the length of the lipid tail and the surrounding chemical\u000d\u000a      environment, both of which can influence peptide activity. In 2009, Hamley\u000d\u000a      and Castelletto (Research Fellow at Reading, 2005-present) began studying\u000d\u000a      the nanostructure of Matrixyl to better understand its mode of action.\u000d\u000a      Despite its widespread commercial use, no previous studies of the\u000d\u000a      physico-chemical properties of Matrixyl had been undertaken. Castelletto\u000d\u000a      and Hamley (at Reading) led the research, although some experiments were\u000d\u000a      also carried out in specialist facilities at the Israel Institute of\u000d\u000a      Technology (Technion). Techniques including atomic force microscopy and\u000d\u000a      pyrene fluorescence microscopy were used to reveal the aggregated\u000d\u000a      nanostructure of Matrixyl. In 2010, the team reported that, unlike\u000d\u000a      compounds of similar size that form cylindrical nanostructures, Matrixyl\u000d\u000a      forms flattened aggregates termed \"nanotapes\".[1] The molecules were\u000d\u000a      stacked in a way that suggested the structure itself may be important in\u000d\u000a      stimulating collagen production.\u000d\u000a    How the chemical environment influences structure\u000d\u000a      In skincare products, Matrixyl is formulated with surfactants such as\u000d\u000a      emulsifiers or dispersants, and it was of fundamental interest to\u000d\u000a      understand how these materials affect self-assembly of Matrixyl and\u000d\u000a      ultimately its biomedical activity. Between 2011 and 2012, Hamley's group\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that a non-ionic polymeric surfactant (Pluronic P-123) can be\u000d\u000a      used to prepare solutions of Matrixyl without disrupting its self-assembly\u000d\u000a      characteristics or altering its activity. [2] They also examined the\u000d\u000a      influence of the anionic surfactant SDS on Matrixyl, finding that, due to\u000d\u000a      electrostatic forces, different nanostructures are formed depending on the\u000d\u000a      amount of SDS added, resulting in modification of its macroscopic\u000d\u000a      characteristics such as a change in morphology from sol to gel. [3] In\u000d\u000a      2013, the team found that changes in pH also affected self-assembly of\u000d\u000a      Matrixyl. At pH2, the Matrixyl formed spherical micelles with the\u000d\u000a      hydrophobic tails inside, whilst at pH3, they assembled into tape-like\u000d\u000a      structures and, at pH4, they formed right-hand twisted fibrous structures.\u000d\u000a      [4]\u000d\u000a    Modifying the lipid tail\u000d\u000a      The Reading group also investigated how the length of the lipid tail\u000d\u000a      altered the self-assembly of Matrixyl-type peptide amphiphiles, using\u000d\u000a      techniques including circular dichroism and small angle X-ray scattering,\u000d\u000a      to understand how tail length affected their physico-chemical properties.\u000d\u000a      They found that skin-permeability increased with longer lipid tails, with\u000d\u000a      a C14 tail formulation estimated to be 3.8 times less permeable\u000d\u000a      than a C16 tail and a C16 tail 3.8 times less\u000d\u000a      permeable than a C18 tail. [5] Therefore it seemed possible at\u000d\u000a      this stage that a PA with a longer lipid tail could have an enhanced\u000d\u000a      collagen-stimulating effect due to a higher skin-permeability, with\u000d\u000a      implications not only in regenerative medicine but also for the skin-cream\u000d\u000a      industry.\u000d\u000a    Proving that Matrixyl stimulates collagen production\u000d\u000a      In 2013, Hamley and colleagues reported that Matrixyl stimulates collagen\u000d\u000a      production in human skin and corneal cells in a concentration-dependent\u000d\u000a      manner, indicating that self-assembly and collagen production are\u000d\u000a      interrelated. [6] The finding was based on nanostructural analyses carried\u000d\u000a      out by Roanne Jones (PhD student, 2010-2013) who was co-supervised by\u000d\u000a      Hamley and Dr Che Connon (Lecturer\/Associate Professor in Pharmacy,\u000d\u000a      2007-date) at Reading. This was the first independent demonstration of the\u000d\u000a      stimulation of collagen production by C16-KTTKS \/ Matrixyl.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37317","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The UK government is committed to delivering a mixture of energy sources\u000d\u000a      that will provide a secure, affordable, low-carbon supply of electricity\u000d\u000a      in the future. Given finite fossil-fuel resources, the pressing need to\u000d\u000a      reduce carbon emissions worldwide and the inadequacy of alternative means\u000d\u000a      of electricity generation, such as wind and wave power, nuclear power\u000d\u000a      represents a major viable source of electricity. In 2012, nuclear energy\u000d\u000a      accounted for 19% of electricity supply (Digest of UK Energy Statistics\u000d\u000a      2013, Department of Energy and Climate Change). Given the UK's target of\u000d\u000a      reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to 20% of their 1990 levels, by\u000d\u000a      2050, nuclear energy is expected to become increasingly important. By\u000d\u000a      2050, up to 49% of the UK's electricity generation could be provided by\u000d\u000a      nuclear power (House of Lords report on Nuclear Research and Development\u000d\u000a      Capabilities, 2011).\u000d\u000a    The UK currently has about 4.7 million cubic metres of nuclear waste, of\u000d\u000a      which 1000 cubic metres is classified as high-level radioactive waste\u000d\u000a      (Radioactive Wastes in the UK, 2010 Inventory, Nuclear Decommissioning\u000d\u000a      Authority). This will grow as the UK invests in new nuclear build. The UK,\u000d\u000a      along with France, currently reprocesses its spent nuclear fuel to recover\u000d\u000a      unused uranium and plutonium, which can then be used again as fuel. The\u000d\u000a      residual waste contains highly radioactive minor actinides (americium,\u000d\u000a      curium and neptunium) as well as corrosion products and non-radioactive\u000d\u000a      fission products such as lanthanides. Whilst comprising less than 0.1% of\u000d\u000a      the mass of the spent fuel, the minor actinides constitute the major\u000d\u000a      long-term hazard, posing extreme, long-term storage problems. They emit\u000d\u000a      highly penetrating gamma-radiation and generate large amounts of heat,\u000d\u000a      requiring deep geological storage for more than 300,000 years. Reducing\u000d\u000a      this nuclear-waste burden would make nuclear power far more sustainable.\u000d\u000a      One approach to this is through the development of strategies to separate\u000d\u000a      (partition) and inactivate (transmute) the highly radioactive minor\u000d\u000a      actinides.\u000d\u000a    The group in Reading developed the CyMe4BTP ligand during the PARTNEW\u000d\u000a      programme (2000 - 2003, budget &#8364;2.2M, 10 partners) and this led to the\u000d\u000a      EUROPART (budget &#8364;6M, 26 partners) and ACSEPT programmes (budget &#8364;9M, 34\u000d\u000a      partners). During these programes, further research at Reading led to the\u000d\u000a      discovery of the CyMe4BTBP and CyMe4BTPhen ligands. Within EUROPART and\u000d\u000a      ACSEPT, partner organisations including the French Atomic Energy\u000d\u000a      Commission were involved in assessing the minor-actinide selectivity of\u000d\u000a      the ligands and in measuring their rates of actinide extraction, stripping\u000d\u000a      qualities, solvent loading and hydrolytic and radiolytic stability. The\u000d\u000a      European Commission continues to support this work through the SACSESS\u000d\u000a      programme (&#8364;5.5M, 24 partners).[a] The ligands developed at Reading have\u000d\u000a      been shown to be highly selective for extraction of the minor actinides\u000d\u000a      (relative to the lanthanides), and they also exhibit significant stability\u000d\u000a      under the extremely radioactive and highly acidic reprocessing conditions.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore &#8212; and crucially in terms of impact &#8212; the CyMe4BTBP ligand has\u000d\u000a      been shown by workers at the European Commission's Joint Nuclear Research\u000d\u000a      Centre in Germany to effectively \"clean up\" real nuclear reprocessing\u000d\u000a      waste.[b]\u000d\u000a    The success of the work to develop selective extractants has impacted on\u000d\u000a      French nuclear policy, as noted in the \"National Plan for Management of\u000d\u000a      Radioactive Materials and Nuclear Waste 2013-2015\" where it is stated (p.\u000d\u000a      214) in Section 4.2. \"Separation of minor actinides\":\u000d\u000a    \"Research has led to the development of specific extractants and methods\u000d\u000a      of separation, successfully tested on the laboratory scale for each\u000d\u000a      process considered: extraction of Americium (EXAM), extraction of\u000d\u000a      Americium and Curium (SANEX) and group extraction of all actinides\u000d\u000a      (GANEX)\". \"In the period 2013-2015 a full scale experiment should be\u000d\u000a      pursued, from the extraction of several kg of spent fuel obtained from\u000d\u000a      actual, current processing operations, right through to the production of\u000d\u000a      pure pellets of Americium dioxide, AmO2.

The Reading group has developed a scalable synthesis of the\u000d\u000a      CyMe4-diketone, a key precursor to all of the ligands, demonstrating for\u000d\u000a      the first time the potential for large-scale industrial production of\u000d\u000a      these compounds. This led to the filing of a patent [d] and the licensing\u000d\u000a      of intellectual property in this patent from the University of Reading to\u000d\u000a      TechnoComm Ltd, a company specialising in technology commercialisation in\u000d\u000a      the chemical sciences.[e] The CyMe4-BTP, CyMe4BTBP and CyMe4-BTPhen\u000d\u000a      ligands are now manufactured and sold by TechnoComm Ltd.[f] These ligands\u000d\u000a      have been purchased for process evaluation by leading national and\u000d\u000a      international nuclear centres such as the NNL (UK), the European\u000d\u000a      Commission Joint Research Centre (Germany), and the Idaho and Oak Ridge\u000d\u000a      National Laboratories (USA), demonstrating that these organisations\u000d\u000a      recognise the potential of the new compounds for effectively treating\u000d\u000a      nuclear waste.\u000d\u000a    Funding to develop a full-scale industrial process for separating minor\u000d\u000a      actinides from nuclear reprocessing waste awaits EU approval. However, the\u000d\u000a      demonstration that CyMe4BTBP shows excellent efficiency and selectivity\u000d\u000a      for the minor actinides on real nuclear reprocessing waste has provided\u000d\u000a      first proof of concept for industrial scale chemical partitioning of the\u000d\u000a      minor actinides and demonstrates the potential to revolutionise nuclear\u000d\u000a      waste management. Not only does it promise to dramatically reduce the\u000d\u000a      levels of radiotoxicity and waste-heat production, but it also paves the\u000d\u000a      way to more efficient use of geological nuclear-waste repositories. This\u000d\u000a      will help to make nuclear power more sustainable, strengthening its role\u000d\u000a      as a genuine alternative to fossil fuels and helping the UK government to\u000d\u000a      meet its 2050 greenhouse-gas emission targets.

However, 3% of the residual waste from\u000d\u000a      current nuclear fuel cycles is extremely radiotoxic and must be stored for\u000d\u000a      some 300,000 years before it can be considered safe. This long-term\u000d\u000a      radiotoxicity arises from the presence of highly radioactive minor\u000d\u000a      actinides (americium, curium and neptunium), though these constitute less\u000d\u000a      than 0.1% of the spent fuel. If these active components can be separated\u000d\u000a      from the accompanying lanthanides, they can be converted to short-lived or\u000d\u000a      non-fissile elements by neutron bombardment, a process known as\u000d\u000a      \"transmutation\", in the next generation of nuclear reactors (\"Generation\u000d\u000a      IV\"). Such reactors are due for deployment between 2020 and 2030 and\u000d\u000a      represent major advances in sustainability, safety, resilience and\u000d\u000a      economics. Transmutation of the minor actinides will reduce waste-storage\u000d\u000a      times a thousand-fold, to only some 300 years. However, separation of the\u000d\u000a      minor actinides from the accompanying lanthanides is essential for\u000d\u000a      transmutation to succeed, as the lanthanides preferentially absorb\u000d\u000a      neutrons in the reactor, so acting as \"neutron poisons\".\u000d\u000a    The challenge of separating very similar chemical species in nuclear\u000d\u000a      waste is made even more difficult by the operating conditions under which\u000d\u000a      it must be carried out: strong radioactive flux and extreme acidicity. In\u000d\u000a      2003, it was shown by researchers at the University of Reading, working\u000d\u000a      with the French Atomic Energy Commission, that bis(triazinyl)-pyridine\u000d\u000a      ligands (BTPs) can selectively extract minor actinides from lanthanides,\u000d\u000a      with a selectivity of around 30:1. However, while these BTPs provided good\u000d\u000a      selectivity under laboratory conditions, they proved unstable under the\u000d\u000a      conditions experienced during nuclear waste reprocessing.[1]\u000d\u000a    Building on this discovery, University of Reading researchers then went\u000d\u000a      on to develop stable extractant molecules that can separate the\u000d\u000a      minor actinides from the chemically very similar lanthanides in nuclear\u000d\u000a      waste. Since 2000, Dr M. J. Hudson (Lecturer\/Reader 1972-2005), Dr C. E.\u000d\u000a      Boucher (Ph.D. student, 2000-2003), Dr T. A. Youngs (Ph.D. student,\u000d\u000a      2000-2004), Dr M. R. St. J.

M.\u000d\u000a      Harwood (Professor of Organic Chemistry, 1995 &#8212; present) have carried out\u000d\u000a      this research.\u000d\u000a    The research undertaken at the University of Reading has led to the\u000d\u000a      design and synthesis of a new series of selective extractants. The first\u000d\u000a      of these, dubbed CyMe4BTP was shown to be stable under typical nuclear\u000d\u000a      reprocessing conditions (high radioactive flux and acidity) and, moreover,\u000d\u000a      showed an unexpectedly high minor-actinide selectivity of 5000:1 relative\u000d\u000a      to lanthanides.[2] Subsequent research by the group led to a\u000d\u000a      second-generation ligand, CyMe4BTBP, which achieved the desired\u000d\u000a      minor-actinide separation from actual downstream reprocessing waste [3],\u000d\u000a      enabling the establishment of Europe's first practical Separation of\u000d\u000a      Actinides and Extraction (SANEX) process. Finally, a third-generation\u000d\u000a      ligand, CyMe4BTPhen, has most recently been developed, which is\u000d\u000a      structurally pre-organised and shows considerably faster rates of\u000d\u000a      extraction. The new ligand achieves high levels of extraction in only 15\u000d\u000a      minutes, as opposed to several hours for CyMe4BTBP, whilst maintaining\u000d\u000a      stability and selectivity.[4]\u000d\u000a    The work at Reading University has been funded by the European Union\u000d\u000a      through four programmes (PARTNEW, 2000-2003; EUROPART, 2004-2007; ACSEPT,\u000d\u000a      2008-2012; and SACCSESS, 2013-2015), with combined budgets of over &#8364;22M,\u000d\u000a      and involving more than 30 research institutes throughout Europe and\u000d\u000a      leading European nuclear-research centres (Commissariat &#224; l'&#201;nergie\u000d\u000a      Atomique, Marcoule, France; National Nuclear Laboratory, Sellafield, UK;\u000d\u000a      Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37331","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Medical devices are a $434 billion market worldwide, and coating systems\u000a      for use in medical devices reached a market value of ~$5.3 billion\/year in\u000a      2012 (Medical Market Outlook Report, Espicom Business Intelligence, 2013).\u000a    Given the very recent date of the fundamental research that underpins the\u000a      technology, it is remarkable that it has already led to new products which\u000a      are now being marketed actively by Biointeractions Ltd.

Substantial savings can be made if\u000a      stent replacement is avoided within the first 3 years after initial\u000a      implantation: up to &#163;5000 per patient is saved if no re-stenting procedure\u000a      is required in this period. However, most polymers used in coatings suffer\u000a      from protein absorption and foreign-body rejection problems, and so need\u000a      to be replaced earlier than this. Also, because most drugs are\u000a      hydrophobic, and the polymer coatings generally used as in situ\u000a      drug-delivery vehicles are not readily permeable to water, the majority of\u000a      the drug remains encapsulated in the polymer and so is never delivered to\u000a      the surrounding tissue. To address these issues, the research team set out\u000a      to develop a more effective coating system for coronary stents that would\u000a      allow efficient delivery of drugs into the bloodstream from the surface of\u000a      the stent. Key targets were (a) to develop a material that allows complete\u000a      release of the chosen therapeutic agent in a controlled manner, whilst (b)\u000a      presenting a non-thrombogenic (i.e. non-protein-absorbing) surface to the\u000a      blood vessel. Achieving these goals was seen as essential to the success\u000a      of an advanced DES.\u000a    The research team [University of Reading and BioInteractions Ltd., funded\u000a      by the Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) programme], developed a series\u000a      of polymer coatings containing hydrophilic subunits that were already\u000a      approved for human use (so avoiding potential regulatory hurdles). The\u000a      polymers were optimised to deliver over 80% of the encapsulated drug in a\u000a      30-day time window, and to ensure that no delamination of the polymer\u000a      coating from the surface of the stent occurred. Thermomechanical analysis\u000a      of the new polymers revealed that they are elastomeric and highly flexible\u000a      (glass transition below room temperature). A low glass transition improves\u000a      the rate of release of the drug: polymers with glass transition\u000a      temperatures higher than ambient are rigid and so display a less\u000a      satisfactory release profile. In fact, elution studies for the drugs\u000a      paclitaxel and sirolimus demonstrated that 100% of the encapsulated drug\u000a      was delivered from the new coating over a 30-day time period. The elution\u000a      rate was further controlled by varying the ratio of hydrophilic to\u000a      hydrophobic subunits in the polymer, allowing drug release for up to 10-\u000a      15 days, and also by varying the structure of the drug via an\u000a      enzyme-mediated modification, which allowed drug elution to be extended to\u000a      around 30 days. The cytostatic drug sirolimus is also known as rapamycin,\u000a      and the KTP programme led to the development of modified versions of\u000a      rapamycin (carbonate esters) that are more suited to polymer-based release\u000a      applications.[1] These technologies (trademarked as AdaptTM)\u000a      have now been commercialised by BioInteractions Ltd.\u000a    Further development was carried out by Dr Rasin-Dadre (KTP Associate and\u000a      PhD student 2008- 2011) as part of a follow-up collaboration between The\u000a      University of Reading and BioInteractions Ltd. Development of one of the\u000a      polymer technologies resulting from the first KTP led to the creation of a\u000a      second-generation material with a substantially greater hydrophilic\u000a      character.[2] The new polymer material contains a component that mimics\u000a      the structure of the outer wall of cells and so is better tolerated by\u000a      biological systems in terms of the foreign-body reaction. The surface of\u000a      this second-generation polymer is remarkably resistant to protein and\u000a      cellular deposition because it promotes the formation of an extensive\u000a      hydration layer that inhibits such deposition. Hence, the new material is\u000a      highly biocompatible and its ability to retain a clean surface allows\u000a      continuous elution of nonpolar drug substances. Apart from greater utility\u000a      for the purposes of generating drug releasable stents, this new material\u000a      has a potentially wide range of applications for any biomedical devices\u000a      that need to be implanted in the body. A partnership between\u000a      BioInteractions Ltd and a custom synthesis laboratory (IsleChem LLC; USA)\u000a      will produce these materials at large scale for clinical evaluation. In\u000a      particular, the main focus of product development from this technology is\u000a      the manufacture of contact lenses for ocular drug delivery and of coatings\u000a      for long-term implantable catheters (Assist&#8482;).\u000a    The project was developed by Simon Onis (Biology specialist,\u000a      BioInteractions, 2006 - present), Alan Rhodes (KTP Associate and PhD\u000a      student, 2006-2008; BioInteractions Senior Scientist, 2008 - present),\u000a      Fanny Raisin-Dadre (KTP Associate and PhD student, 2008 - 2011;\u000a      BioInteractions Research Scientist, 2011 - present), John Mckendrick\u000a      (Lecturer\/Associate Professor in Chemistry 2000 - present; academic\u000a      supervisor to AR and FRD), Shivpal Sandhu (Research Director,\u000a      BioInteractions, 2006 - 2008) and Ajay Luthra (CEO, BioInteractions, 2006\u000a      - present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38357","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Cardiome Pharma, a Canadian pharmaceutical company, recognised in 2003\u000a      that the team\u000a      at QUB had the ability to deliver kilogram quantities, to GMP standard, of\u000a      a chiral\u000a      intermediate required for an alternative chemoenzymatic route to their new\u000a      drug candidate\u000a      RSD1235 for a clinical trial for the treatment of atrial fibrillation by\u000a      intravenous injection.

Hg is also a\u000d\u000a      strong catalyst poison for downstream units.\u000d\u000a    The current technologies used to remove mercury are chemically-modified\u000d\u000a      activated carbons (with sulphur for gas treatment, and potassium iodide\u000d\u000a      for liquid hydrocarbon treatment) and more expensive technologies, such as\u000d\u000a      silver-impregnated molecular sieves and mixed metal sulphide\/oxide\u000d\u000a      scrubbers.

We drew on our expertise to\u000d\u000a      design an entirely new ionic liquid based approach to remove mercury from\u000d\u000a      natural gas supplies, a feat that has much broader applications. The\u000d\u000a      underpinning research has been performed since the formation of QUILL in\u000d\u000a      1999 to now. Over this period of time a significant understanding of the\u000d\u000a      controlling features of ionic liquids was determined from a fundamental\u000d\u000a      perspective. This included the phase behaviour of ionic liquids and the\u000d\u000a      effect of anion and cation structure as well as new synthetic methods for\u000d\u000a      the production of low cost ionic liquids and the effect of impurities\u000d\u000a      (halide and water, for example) on physicochemical properties of the\u000d\u000a      materials (references 1-5 in section 3).

This is\u000d\u000a      important because the frequency with which new classes of abused\u000d\u000a      substances appear is increasing, as is the speed at which they are adopted\u000d\u000a      to become global problems. (reference 3 in section 5).\u000d\u000a    The impact of this work is being extended beyond FSNI. Firstly, the\u000d\u000a      cathinone trial has been extended to the \"Celtic Fringe\" group of\u000d\u000a      government forensic laboratories which include Scottish and Eire labs\u000d\u000a      (reference 4 in section 5). In addition, the Palestinian National\u000d\u000a      Authority are in the process of purchasing a Raman system for routine drug\u000d\u000a      analysis for their new forensic laboratories due to be completed 2013\u000d\u000a      (reference 1 in section 5). The FBI in the United States has been\u000d\u000a      investigating the use of Raman spectroscopy for paint examination using a\u000d\u000a      sample library supplied by QUB (reference 6 in section 5) and in a\u000d\u000a      recent publication described the QUB series of paint papers as \"important\u000d\u000a      to the forensic community because they provide data to support the highly\u000d\u000a      discriminating nature of comparative paint examination\" (reference 7 in\u000a        section 5). All the above clearly shows the global impact of the\u000d\u000a      research undertaken given its widespread adoption.\u000d\u000a\u0009  Whilst the immediate\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries of the research are the forensic science agencies, the work\u000d\u000a      also has significant societal benefit in providing more robust analysis\u000d\u000a      methods which can be performed rapidly and routinely. This combination\u000d\u000a      allows a wider range of samples to be examined and the creation of\u000d\u000a      patterns of behaviour which will lead to prosecution and convictions.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Techniques that can produce detailed chemical information rapidly and\u000d\u000a      non-destructively for many forensic applications have been developed by\u000d\u000a      Queen's University Belfast based on Raman analysis.

In 1999, the Queen's\u000d\u000a      team led by Bell recognised the potential of Raman as a method to analyse\u000d\u000a      for drugs of abuse, specifically ecstasy. In collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      Forensic Science Agency in Northern Ireland, Bell's group demonstrated,\u000d\u000a      for the first time, the use of Raman spectroscopy for the identification\u000d\u000a      of ecstasy and related drugs.[see reference 1 in section 3] In\u000d\u000a      addition, the method was sensitive enough to identify the cutting agents\u000d\u000a      as well as the drug present in a wide range of seized samples thus\u000d\u000a      providing critical information on the particular blend in order to\u000d\u000a      discriminate between different batches of tablets that had been seized in\u000d\u000a      raids. The ability to link a single ecstasy tablet to the dealer in less\u000d\u000a      than a minute had great potential for drugs intelligence work since it\u000d\u000a      allowed distribution pathways to be tracked and a large scale pilot study\u000d\u000a      on seized samples was performed. [see reference 2 in section 3]\u000d\u000a      This led to work which established the method for moving Raman from a\u000d\u000a      specialist university laboratory method to routine tool for high\u000d\u000a      throughput drugs analysis.[reference 3 in section 3]\u000d\u000a    This work was extended to the identification of cathinones, a family of\u000d\u000a      once `legal highs' which was banned in 2010, by Bell and Fletcher in\u000d\u000a      Queen's. Here the Raman methods were supplemented by NMR and mass\u000d\u000a      spectroscopy techniques in order to identify which of the many potential\u000d\u000a      drug compounds from this family were actually being distributed. Queen's\u000d\u000a      synthesised reference samples of important cathinones to provide standard\u000d\u000a      samples which were used to populate a materials library and to allow the\u000d\u000a      relationship between structure and spectra to be determined.[see reference\u000d\u000a      4 in section 3].\u000d\u000a    Work on paint analysis followed a similar pattern, with initial studies\u000d\u000a      in 2005 on what information the spectra could provide followed by a\u000d\u000a      demonstration of how those data could be used to provide discrimination\u000d\u000a      between real world samples.[references 5,6 in section 3] In\u000d\u000a      particular, analysis of white paints was important since they are common\u000d\u000a      in forensic casework but difficult to discriminate using standard methods.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38360","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2215636","Name":"Libya"},{"GeoNamesId":"1227603","Name":"Sri Lanka"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Based on the seminal research undertaken by\u000a      de Silva, Roche developed, in conjunction with\u000a      QUB, a blood analyser which was commercialised\u000a      and has been the market leader in point-of-care\u000a      analyzers ever since (Figure 2). Throughout the\u000a      period 2008-13 this R&amp;D programme has led to\u000a      sales of US$50M of the diagnostic cassettes\u000a      used in the OPTI device) (see reference 1 in\u000a        section 5) clearly demonstrating economic impact of\u000a      the fundamental research undertaken in QUB.\u000a\u000aFigure 2 OPTI cassettes sold by Optimedical Inc\u000a(www.optimedical.com).

The research at QUB which\u000a      started in 1993,\u000a      developed an understanding of the mechanism associated with PET sensors\u000a      (references 1 and 2\u000a      in section 3), based on Nobel Prize winning Marcus Theory which\u000a      explains the rates of the electron\u000a      transfer reactions. The mechanistic understanding obtained allowed the\u000a      design of a modular\u000a      sensor consisting of a fluorescent unit and a receptor unit joined through\u000a      a spacer molecule (Figure\u000a      1). When optically excited, this allows the transfer of an electron\u000a      to\/from the fluorescent unit from\/to\u000a      the receptor, as occurs in plant photosynthesis, so that fluorescence is\u000a      killed off. When the\u000a      receptor captures a suitable cation, however, such as sodium, the\u000a      increased positive charge\u000a      prevents the electron transfer, allowing fluorescence. Additionally, the\u000a      research demonstrated that\u000a      changes in conformation caused by species occupying the receptor can\u000a      enhance the fluorescence\u000a      switching effect. Critically, as a result of the understanding formulated\u000a      by the Queen's group, the\u000a      combination of components has been able to be manipulated to selectively\u000a      detect analytes at\u000a      concentrations as low as 10-7 M, thus enabling, for example pH,\u000a      calcium, sodium and potassium\u000a      ion concentration to be determined from the same sample in a flow through\u000a      system via a number of\u000a      sensors in series. Furthermore, the Queen's group OFF state PET\u000a      developed the fluorescent PET sensors to be designed so\u000a      that a substantial number of other cationic, anionic and\u000a      neutral species are also accommodated to trigger Spacer Receptor\u000a      fluorescence leading to the technology to be transferred to a\u000a      commercial process and the design of sensors and devices\u000a      for much wider applications, for example in the field of\u000a      molecular logic based computation (reference 3 in section\u000a      3), of which the initial sensors acted as YES gates. Other\u000a      molecules, which behaved as AND gates, (references 3-6 in\u000a      section 3) also emerged.

Each process is underpinned by recycling protocols\u000a      and economic evaluations. Typically the company produces 1000 to 3000 kg\u000a      of ionic liquids p.a. which is significant for such a nascent technology.\u000a      The company has developed several commercial scale processes in\u000a      collaboration with UoL and the end users.

The technology was showcased through the Ionic\u000a      Liquid Demonstrator which is an industry facing showcase based at UoL\u000a      containing six pilot plants each using &gt; 50 kg of ionic liquids [3].\u000a      Since its opening in June 2009 more than 25 businesses have used the Ionic\u000a      Liquids Demonstrator Unit including Dow, MacDermid, HydroQuebec and\u000a      Silberline.

The original work\u000a      in this area led to Abbott being awarded the Industry and Green Medals by\u000a      the Royal Society of Chemistry [5, 6].\u000a    Electropolishing: Rolls-Royce Aerospace was assisted by Ryder\u000a      working at their Derby site (originally under the auspices of the Royal\u000a      Society Industry Fellowship scheme (2010-2012) and then under a HEIF\u000a      funded Fellowship). He developed a new approach to superalloy processing\u000a      using electrochemical etching. To deliver the impact it was necessary to\u000a      understand the role of ionic liquids in electrolytic removal of oxide\u000a      films and dissolution of metals from Ni super alloy castings. The\u000a      mechanism of scale formation was elucidated in collaboration with Rolls\u000a      Royce. The surface chemistries, morphologies and mathematical modelling of\u000a      the cooling process were also studied in high temperature melts.\u000a    The scale removal is greatly simplified using ionic liquids and is not\u000a      possible from conventional aqueous acid electrolytes. Typically these\u000a      parts are deployed in the Trent series of engines that power Boeing and\u000a      Airbus passenger aircraft. The project succeeded in streamlining\u000a      production of the blade components by scale removal (using ionic liquids)\u000a      prior to the expensive heat-treatment and annealing processes. This cannot\u000a      currently be achieved because alternative techniques for scale removal,\u000a      before heat-treatment, cause solid state recrystallisation in the alloys\u000a      producing grain boundaries that lead to stress fractures. Rolls Royce\u000a      Aerospace has now embarked on a technology readiness pathway leading to\u000a      the use of Leicester's ionic liquids technology. The company is now\u000a      collaborating with Ryder to solve specific production problems associated\u000a      with surface scale in engine production parts, with a view to fully\u000a      implementing ionic liquids technology in its production processes.\u000a    Silver Plating: Since October 2009, PW Circuits of Leicester has\u000a      operated a full coating process developed by the Leicester Ionic Liquids\u000a      Group based on an 8 tank line using c.a. 1 tonne of ionic liquid. Simple\u000a      immersion of a copper coated printed circuit board in a mixture of\u000a      ethylene glycol and choline chloride with silver chloride produces boards\u000a      which not only meet all industry requirements but actually improve over\u000a      existing techniques in functions such as solderability. The liquid\u000a      developed significantly reduced the cost of immersion coating as it used a\u000a      less expensive silver salt than the current industry standard. The quality\u000a      of the product in terms of its solderability and resistance to tarnishing\u000a      was independently verified by the European Institute of Printed Circuits\u000a      [7].\u000a    The processes commercialised to date and their key impacts are listed\u000a      below and many of the impacts have been independently verified.

The research originated from a consultancy for Johnson Matthey\u000a      in 1997 on the electrodeposition of aluminium alloys using traditional\u000a      chloroaluminate based ionic liquids. The original patents covered over 106\u000a      liquids and it was immediately clear that the almost limitless\u000a      formulations had significant commercial application. This led directly to\u000a      the formation of a University of Leicester spinout company, Scionix Ltd.,\u000a      in 1999. A joint venture model was adopted with a partner who has the\u000a      capacity to manufacture the liquids on the multi-tonne scale (Whyte\u000a      Chemicals). Customers range from academic groups through to large scale\u000a      industry (see below). The term Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) was coined to\u000a      differentiate them from ionic liquids with discrete anions. The advantages\u000a      of these liquids are that they can be easily prepared in bulk, they are\u000a      comparable in cost to bulk molecular solvents, and can be prepared from\u000a      bulk commodity chemicals such as choline chloride with hydrogen bond\u000a      donors such as glycerol, and urea which have negligible ecotoxicity [1,2].\u000a      The unusual solvent properties make them ideal for metal processing\u000a      applications such as metal deposition, dissolution or recycling. The\u000a      Leicester Group of Abbott, Davies, Frisch, and Ryder have\u000a      published 75 papers on DESs covering topics such as metal deposition and\u000a      dissolution, mass transport and redox properties. This has been pertinent\u000a      to all of the metal deposition and dissolution processes developed to date\u000a      by helping design liquids specific to each application.\u000a    Fundamental Studies: To be able to design and apply a new class of\u000a      liquids Abbott and Ryder developed fundamental new insight\u000a      into the viscosity, conductivity and mass transport in all types of ionic\u000a      liquids [3]. It was shown by the Leicester group that the large ion size\u000a      means that mass transport is limited by the availability of holes for ions\u000a      to move into. This means that viscosity can be modelled using hole theory\u000a      and conductivity can be modelled using a Nernst Einstein model because the\u000a      holes are effectively at infinite dilution. It was shown that classical\u000a      diffusion does not occur in ionic liquids with ions moving by a series of\u000a      jumps between suitably sized voids. It was also shown that some liquids\u000a      form ideal solutions allowing concentration effects of redox potentials to\u000a      be modelled [4]. This has led to the development of liquids with some of\u000a      the lowest viscosities and highest conductivities yet reported and these\u000a      are being applied to the latest generation of liquids for chromium\u000a      plating.\u000a    In addition Abbott, Ryder and Frisch coined the term Ionometallurgy\u000a      to describe the dissolution and selective recovery of metals using ionic\u000a      liquids [5]. They produced the first galvanic series in an ionic liquid\u000a      and showed that in some ionic liquids metal salts form ideal solutions.\u000a      This has allowed the first standard redox potentials to be determined\u000a      which were shown to be related to speciation in different ionic liquids.\u000a      This has helped with the development of a new class of liquids which do\u000a      not involve quaternary ammonium salts which is now being exploited for\u000a      aluminium electrodeposition through an EU project.\u000a    Since 2009 the group has been engaged in detailed studies of surface\u000a      morphology and chemistry using a unique combination of electrochemical\u000a      acoustic resonator as well as X-ray techniques and liquid phase probe\u000a      microscopy to understand the correlations between macroscopic effects such\u000a      as surface finish, brightness and appearance with the microscopic\u000a      environment at the electrochemical interface. This environment encompasses\u000a      the molecular structure of metal ions in the liquids as well as complex\u000a      kinetic phenomena such as electrochemical nucleation and growth. Both of\u000a      these can be affected by addition of molecular ligands that are known\u000a      colloquially as levellers and brighteners in the metal finishing industry.\u000a      In 2010 these facilities were augmented by holographic microscopy (giving\u000a      orders of magnitude faster data acquisition) and in 2012 optical profiling\u000a      for non-contact characterisation. This has informed the development of\u000a      novel brighteners for use in electroplating baths [6].\u000a    Developing Impact: Most of the ionic liquid based metal plating\u000a      processes were initially developed through the Leicester group who\u000a      instigated a consortium consisting of 33 partners for the EU-funded\u000a      IONMET project (EU, FP7 contract No.: 515743) between 2008 and 10. This\u000a      covered not only the fundamental aspects of deposition mechanism but also\u000a      developed additives to make electroplate brighter. It was able to produce\u000a      efficient, environmentally-compatible techniques for depositing thin\u000a      layers of metals such as copper, nickel, aluminium and silver together\u000a      with alloys such as Zn\/Sn. Other outputs were developed through two\u000a      further EU grants, 6 TSB grants, a Royal Society Industry Fellowship\u000a      (Ryder) Rolls-Royce) and a KTP grant all of which involved industrial\u000a      partners such as Corus, Rolls Royce, Anopol Ltd and CTech.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38821","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact achieved from these research findings has been through\u000a      significantly influencing the policies and priorities of the world's most\u000a      active space agencies in terms of the scientific objectives of their space\u000a      exploration programmes, in mission design and on the instrumentation\u000a      carried on spacecraft.

Griffiths,\u000a      the Program Scientist for Physics of the Cosmos at NASA has stated: \"This\u000a        work, exemplified by that performed by Smith and Sims, is seminal to our\u000a        understanding of the low-temperature reactions which lead to the\u000a        production of complex molecules within interstellar clouds, molecules\u000a        which are evidenced by observations made using instruments on space\u000a        telescopes\". [source 1]\u000a    A Rosetta Mission Project Scientist, Rita Schulz (see below) also\u000a      confirmed that the Herschel Space Observatory, launched in 2009, has the\u000a      study of the low temperature chemistry of complex organics in molecular\u000a      clouds as a key objective, and that this is a further example of a mission\u000a      where benefits will rely on this research.\u000a    Impact on Comet Missions: ESA's Rosetta mission\u000a    Having knowledge of the composition of interstellar clouds allows\u000a      designers of Solar System exploration missions to include instrumentation\u000a      that can search for these various species on or in planetary and smaller\u000a      bodies (asteroids, comets, moons). It is here that the published work of\u000a      Smith\/Sims has had the most impact, affecting instrument design,\u000a      spacecraft operations and instrument configurations during the exploration\u000a      phase. Building on the results from ESA's GIOTTO mission, the Rosetta\u000a      mission to rendezvous and land on a comet in 2014 has the study of these\u000a      complex organics as a key objective.\u000a    The Rosetta spacecraft will be the first to undertake the long-term\u000a      exploration of a comet at close quarters and also the first mission to\u000a      land on a comet. The craft comprises a large orbiter, which is designed to\u000a      operate for a decade at large distances from the Sun, and a small lander.\u000a      The craft carries a total of 21 instruments (11 in the Orbiter, 10 on the\u000a      Lander) designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever\u000a      attempted. [source 2] Three of these instruments carry out activities that\u000a      draw significantly on the work at Birmingham.\u000a    [text removed for publication] the Rosetta Mission Project Scientist\u000a      confirmed the contribution of the Birmingham research to the Rosetta\u000a      mission as follows: \"Three mass spectrometers, two on the Lander (COSAC\u000a        and PTOEMY) and one on the Orbiter {COSIMA), are designed to study\u000a        in-situ the composition of comet refractories specifically focussing on\u000a        organic macromolecules. They will measure molecular numbers of CHON\u000a        particles from which certain chemical groups may be identified. However,\u000a        to be able to conclude on a specific derivate or clearly attribute the\u000a        results to specific organic molecules, laboratory measurements are\u000a        required that allow to determine th probability of their synthesis in a\u000a        low temperature environment.\u000a    Important work was done at Birmingham University's School of Chemical\u000a        Sciences on low-temperature gas-phase chemistry and kinetics. Many of\u000a        the ion-neutral and neutral-neutral processes studied and reaction rates\u000a        determined by Smith, Sims and Rowe have been particularly helpful in\u000a        view to understanding interstellar chemistry and its relations to\u000a        volatiles in comets. I believe that without the research work from\u000a        Birmingham University over the past some twenty years we would have a\u000a        poorer Rosetta mission &#8212; particularly as much of it was conducted during\u000a        the mission's critical design and build phase in the 90's. Furthermore\u000a        on arrival at our target comet the past efforts of the School of\u000a        Chemical Sciences related to low temperature reaction rates will be\u000a        invaluable in interpreting the chemistry that will be underway as our\u000a        comet makes its way ever closer to our sun.\" [source 3]\u000a    Impact on Planetary Missions: Mars and the Jovian moons\u000a    Comets are one end of the exploration spectrum. Planetary bodies,\u000a      particularly Mars and the moons of Jupiter such as Europa and Ganymede,\u000a      are the other and have recently become centre of attention. Current and\u000a      planned missions to Mars by NASA, ESA and the Russian Space Agency RKA\u000a      have the search for life, extinct or extant, as a key aim, with complex\u000a      organic molecules now a precursor in that search. The same can be said of\u000a      the study of the Jovian moons, a mini solar-system in its own right.\u000a      Mission designers, instrument developers and spacecraft\/payload operations\u000a      all have the work of Smith and Sims at the UoB underpinning their\u000a      scientific objectives.\u000a    [text removed for publication] the former Head of ESA's Science\u000a      Technology and Future Science Missions Department, has confirmed the\u000a      continuing impact of the Birmingham research on these programmes as\u000a      follows: \"... future missions in their early preparatory phases such as\u000a        the exploration of the Jovian moon Europa or Exoplanet characterisation,\u000a        instrument and mission design will again be influenced by the search for\u000a        organic molecules. Without the research of Smith and Sims, these mission\u000a        concepts would be much more limited. But now the search for complex\u000a        organics and potential bio-chemical signatures is on the agenda. In\u000a        short, studies of the constituents of the interstellar medium and the\u000a        exploration of our solar system owe a debt to the work of Smith and\u000a        Sims. Without their research we would still be designing missions with\u000a        for astronomy a mainly exploratory focus and for the solar system an\u000a        emphasis on geophysics. This readjustment of the scientific objectives\u000a        will have far reaching implications on mission design, instrument\u000a        complement and ultimately cost.\" [source 4]\u000a    NASA and ESA are currently pursuing separate missions (JUNO and JUICE\u000a      respectively) to the Jovian system acting as precursors with a key\u000a      long-term science objective to search for evidence of life &#8212; indeed JUICE\u000a      will search for evidence of habitability on these moons. If one of these\u000a      missions does discover biological signatures this will have a profound\u000a      impact on mankind's place in the Solar System and the Universe. While the\u000a      goal of these major missions is such a return, they are underpinned by the\u000a      fundamental scientific research on low temperature reaction rates and\u000a      species production conducted by Smith, Sims and their co-workers.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The spectroscopic observation in the interstellar medium (ISM) of an\u000a      increasing number of molecules has demonstrated the presence of a rich\u000a      chemistry, especially in the low temperature (ca. 10 K) environment\u000a      of dense interstellar clouds. Understanding this chemistry requires the\u000a      combined efforts of modellers and laboratory scientists. In the 1990's,\u000a      research at the University of Birmingham pioneered a series of unique\u000a      measurements in which rate coefficients for reactions were measured at\u000a      temperatures down to as low as 13 K.

This\u000a      technique had originally been developed to study reactions between cations\u000a      and stable molecules. Since they show zero or even negative dependence of\u000a      the rate constant with temperature (Langevin 1905), they proceed at the\u000a      same or higher rate at very low temperatures as they do at room\u000a      temperature. Such reactions had always been assumed to be the primary\u000a      building blocks for molecules in the ISM, where the temperature can be as\u000a      low as 5 K. The primary (and surprising) finding of the Smith\/Sims\u000a      research was that there are a significant number of neutral-neutral\u000a      reactions that also proceed rapidly at these very low temperatures, with\u000a      the result that all the old models for the chemistry of the ISM have had\u000a      to be re-assessed and re-written. Whereas it was not unexpected that\u000a      reactions between two open-shell free radicals (e.g. N + OH &#8594; NO +\u000a      H) are rapid at low temperatures, a remarkable and unexpected finding was\u000a      that these rapid neutral-neutral reactions include an atom or a molecular\u000a      free radical reacting with a `stable' molecule (e.g. CN + C2H2\u000a      &#8594; HC3N + H). [Refs 3 and 4] Some of this research was carried\u000a      out in collaboration with Dr Bertrand Rowe, Universit&#233; de Rennes \/ CNRS\u000a      Rennes, France.\u000a    This research has deep and rather far-reaching implications. For example\u000a      the European Space Agency's (ESA) GIOTTO space mission performed the first\u000a      comet encounter with Halley's Comet in 1986 and discovered a large number\u000a      of complex carbon-based molecules (CHON or Carbon Hydrogen Oxygen and\u000a      Nitrogen particles). Only after the work of Smith\/Sims did astrochemists\u000a      understand how these molecules might be synthesised. There is a particular\u000a      interest in these species because they may have contributed to the start\u000a      of life on Earth &#8212; and, possibly other planets such as Mars and the Jovian\u000a      moons such as Europa. ESA, supported with some instrumentation from NASA,\u000a      quickly developed the Rosetta mission to rendezvous with and land on a\u000a      comet to study, in part, these CHON particles and the complex chemistry\u000a      underway at low temperatures &#8212; the goal being nothing less than to\u000a      determine the content and nature of the molecules present in comets.\u000a    It is clear that our understanding of how these CHON molecules form, both\u000a      in comets and in molecular clouds, is of fundamental importance to\u000a      modelling the evolution of the universe and in particular our solar system\u000a      and its associated biological evolution. ESA Solar System exploration\u000a      missions are built around four axioms: science objectives, design,\u000a      development and operations, all of which are underpinned by the work of\u000a      Smith, Sims and co-workers. Indeed specific past papers (see below) from\u000a      the UoB School of Chemistry dealing with reaction rates at these very low\u000a      temperatures have been particularly useful in shaping the Rosetta and\u000a      JUICE missions in this area of science. In addition two of ESA's\u000a      astrophysical missions, Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) &amp; Herschel,\u000a      have also benefited from this work (for scientific publications arising\u000a      from ISO, see: http:\/\/iso.esac.esa.int\/science\/publications.html).\u000a    To the present day, the UoB, including the Physical and Theoretical\u000a      Chemistry Research Unit, continues with experimental physical chemistry\u000a      research, including gas phase work (e.g. Tuckett, School of Chemistry and\u000a      Mayhew, School of Physics).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38822","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact from MOLPRO in the REF window has been primarily economic and\u000a      can be quantified through sales of MOLPRO to academia and industry\u000a      throughout the REF window, as follows (data provided by Cardiff\u000a      University): &#163;1,783,714 (January 2008 &#8212; July 2013).

As distinct from other commonly used\u000a      quantum chemistry packages, the emphasis is on highly accurate\u000a      computations, with extensive treatment of the electron correlation\u000a      problem.\u000a    MP2 (M&#248;ller-Plesset perturbation theory to second order) is widely used\u000a      to include \"dynamic correlation\" in the calculation of molecular energies,\u000a      which needs to be performed for accurate results. The standard methods\u000a      scale poorly so can only be applied to small molecules. At Birmingham,\u000a      Manby (funded by a Royal Society Fellowship) and Knowles developed\u000a      density-fitting methods suitable for Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham (density\u000a      functional theory, DFT) calculations. Two papers were published together\u000a      on this work (Manby and Knowles PRL (01) 87: 163001, [Ref 1] Manby,\u000a      Knowles and Lloyd JCP (01) 115: 9144 [Ref 2]) as well as a paper on\u000a      automatic code generation in DFT [Ref 3].\u000a    In 2001, Manby left for the University of Bristol and continued this work\u000a      together with Knowles at Birmingham. They then combined it with so-called\u000a      linear scaling methods that are efficient for calculating the\u000a      wavefunctions of large molecules and this led to the DF-LMP2 method\u000a      (Werner, Manby and Knowles JCP (03) 118: 8149. [Ref 4]). This work\u000a      facilitates an approach for the modelling of larger molecules using\u000a      accurate ab initio or quantum mechanical (QM) methodologies that\u000a      can then be coupled with faster, but generally less accurate, molecular\u000a      mechanical (MM) methodologies. The significance of this paper can be seen\u000a      by it having &gt;300 citations. The work was implemented in MOLPRO 2003\u000a      when it was hosted and licensed from the University of Birmingham and is\u000a      an integral part of the MOLPRO package (see Section 4). The evidence for\u000a      the continuing academic importance of this DF-LMP2 work (detailed in Ref\u000a      4) and its role in the MOLPRO package is evidenced by recent papers and\u000a      review articles on the use of computational models to study large\u000a      biological molecules:\u000a    Banas et al in a review on RNA catalysis in Methods\u000a      (2009), 49, 202-216 state: \"...Another, very different and so far less\u000a        popular approximation is local treatment of orbitals; for example, MP2\u000a        method with this local approximation is abbreviated as LMP2 (see, e.g.\u000a        Ref [4]).

The superior accuracy of high-level ab initio methods can\u000a        now therefore also be exploited for biomolecular QM\/MM studies,\u000a        certainly at the level of energy calculations at fixed geometry (i.e.,\u000a        single points)...\"\u000a    In 2003, Knowles left Birmingham for Cardiff University.

The\u000a      licensing arrangements for MOLPRO as a semi-commercial program were\u000a      transferred to Cardiff upon Knowles' departure.

Information published\u000a      on GlySure's website, and\u000a      also confirmed by the company to the University, proves that this novel\u000a      chemistry is crucial to the\u000a      technology that unpins their business.\u000a    The impact to July 2013 is evidenced in both commercial and health terms.\u000a      GlySure was founded\u000a      in 2006 as a new venture to develop the Birmingham invented glucose\u000a      recognition technology.\u000a      Since 2008 it has raised &#163;9.5m venture capital investment for this purpose\u000a      and had 30 employees\u000a      in June 2013 (increased from 16 in 2012), with the company's activities\u000a      wholly focused on this\u000a      device. Positive results of clinical trials, which began in 2010, have\u000a      been reported by the company.\u000a      GlySure's focus is now working on achieving regulatory approval in Europe,\u000a      and the company has\u000a      reported that it expected to begin CE mark trials in 2013.

[source 1] A\u000a      factor hampering implementation of this approach has been the absence of a\u000a      practical method of\u000a      achieving continuous monitoring of patient's glucose levels in an\u000a      intensive care unit. Clinicians\u000a      face difficulties in implementing this extent of tight glycaemic control\u000a      through traditional finger-prick\u000a      blood samples: taking blood samples in this way is resource-intensive for\u000a      nursing staff; provides\u000a      intermittent rather than continuous measurement; patients can be left with\u000a      sore fingers and hands.\u000a    A number of companies, mainly in the US, have tried to find solutions to\u000a      this issue over the last\u000a      decade, often trying to apply approaches from the diabetes industry to\u000a      intensive care purposes, as\u000a      described in a 2012 article in the medical business press. However, none\u000a      have been successful in\u000a      bringing a product to market. GlySure is a new entrant to this\u000a      market, and has used the findings\u000a      from the Birmingham research as a crucial feature of a novel method\u000a      designed specifically for\u000a      intensive case applications. [source 2]\u000a    GlySure's monitoring system\u000a    The GlySure system comprises two main parts; a monitor and a sterile\u000a      disposable set (which\u000a      includes a fibre-optic sensor and integrated calibration module). The\u000a      sensor interfaces with the\u000a      patient's pre-existing intravascular line (arterial or venous) without\u000a      disrupting the clinician's ability\u000a      to monitor pressure, draw blood or administer medication through those\u000a      lines. The sensor contains\u000a      fluorescent indicator chemistry (invented in Birmingham), which produces a\u000a      signal that is\u000a      proportional to the glucose concentration in the patient's blood.\u000a    The sensor is a sterile single-use device. Its fluorophore-receptor\u000a      indicator chemistry is patent\u000a      protected and under exclusive world-wide licence to GlySure. The\u000a      reversible nature of the glucose-fluorophore\u000a\u0009  bond enables monitoring throughout the patient's length of\u000a      stay with the same sensor.\u000a      GlySure argue that their technology exceeds the requirements of\u000a      clinicians, while also significantly\u000a      reducing time and cost.\u000a    Birmingham's contribution to GlySure's system\u000a    GlySure were recommended to consider the Birmingham findings by\u000a      James and subsequently\u000a      obtained a licence from Beckman Coulter Inc. (the original owners\u000a      of the patent) to utilise them in\u000a      their product. In 2012, GlySure purchased this patent from Beckman\u000a        Coulter, underlining the\u000a      importance of this to their activity.\u000a    Glysure's Chief Technology Officer has confirmed that the\u000a      Birmingham discovery is making a\u000a      distinct and material contribution to their product, and that that these\u000a      findings have enabled them to\u000a      develop a sensor that is highly selective to glucose in a biological\u000a      environment [the blood of\u000a      critically ill patients] that abounds with both exogenous and endogenous\u000a      potential interferents. This\u000a      selectivity facilitates the use of a continuous sensor over many hours\u000a      whilst maintaining its\u000a      accuracy. [source 3]\u000a    The importance of the discovery made at Birmingham to this device is\u000a      described on the GlySure\u000a      website, which says: The core to this technology is the\u000a        fluorescent\/receptor glucose indicator\u000a        chemistry. This chemistry is structured to be selective for glucose and\u000a        is immobilised into an optical\u000a        cell that is micro machined into the fibre itself. The selectivity for\u000a        glucose is imparted by the\u000a        specifically configured diboronic acid receptor that is covalently\u000a        linked to the fluorophore and forms\u000a        part of the single molecule indicator chemistry. This\u000a        fluorophore-receptor indicator chemistry is\u000a        covered by US patent 6,387,672 B1 which is owned by GlySure.

The company has\u000a      attracted a total\u000a      of &#163;12.5 million venture capital investment since its formation in 2006,\u000a      including a &#163;7 million\u000a      investment in 2012 to be used to complete the necessary clinical trials as\u000a      part of obtaining\u000a      regulatory approval for the glucose monitoring system in Europe and the\u000a      USA.

In the modern era, carbohydrate chemistry has\u000a      continued in the\u000a      School of Chemistry (SoC) though supramolecular recognition chemistry\u000a      (James and currently\u000a      Fossey, appointed 2008) and synthetic chemistry (Cox, appointed 1999).\u000a    Professor T. D. James (Royal Society Research Fellow, School of\u000a      Chemistry, University of\u000a      Birmingham, Oct 1995 &#8212; Aug 2000, now at University of Bath) undertook\u000a      research in boronic acid-based\u000a      carbohydrate recognition chemistry at Birmingham (see references listed in\u000a      section 3). His\u000a      work uncovered the requirements for high glucose selectivity amongst his\u000a      saccharide sensors.\u000a    Boronic acids reversibly and covalently bind to diols (including sugars);\u000a      this reversibility is ideal for\u000a      a continuous sensing ensemble, yet specificity between different sugars is\u000a      not high. Indeed among\u000a      common monosaccharides, fructose has the highest binding affinity for\u000a      simple aryl boronic acids.\u000a      To engineer a boronic acid construct with non-typical binding affinity\u000a      (i.e. glucose selective)\u000a      required the combination of two boronic acid groups into one molecular\u000a      sensor. Thus, through\u000a      judicious molecular positioning of two boronic acid groups, a two-point\u000a      and highly specific binding\u000a      to glucose is possible.\u000a    James' research into saccharide sensors was developed in collaboration\u000a      with Beckman Coulter\u000a        Inc., who funded a research project led by James at Birmingham on\u000a      this topic (Development of\u000a        Particulate Fluorescent Receptors for Clinical Analyses, Beginning with\u000a        Glucose, Sept 1999 to Aug\u000a      2000, award value: &#163;59,843). The research led to a patent filed in\u000a      December 2000 [patent 1,\u000a      details given below]. James and Arimori (Research Fellow, SoC, University\u000a      of Birmingham, Jan\u000a      2000 &#8212; Aug 2000) are recorded as the inventors on this patent. James'\u000a      research that contributed to\u000a      this patent was substantially undertaken whilst he was at Birmingham.\u000a      However, the terms of the\u000a      contract with Beckman Coulter meant that the research outputs\u000a      directly related to that patent were\u000a      not published until after he had left the University.\u000a    James continued this research after leaving Birmingham to join the\u000a      University of Bath where he is\u000a      currently a Professor in the Department of Chemistry. The fundamental\u000a      discovery of molecularly\u000a      engineered selectivity in boronic acid sugar recognition in Birmingham by\u000a      James has been used\u000a      directly by industrial partners and has inspired subsequent research in\u000a      Birmingham (Fossey,\u000a      Lecturer since October 2008, who worked with James at Bath before joining\u000a      Birmingham) and at\u000a      Bath. Recently Fossey, James and collaborators at GlySure have been\u000a      granted a further patent\u000a      (patent 2) on the implementation of glucose selective sensors for use in\u000a      intravascular blood-glucose\u000a      sensing. This recent work complements the suite of patents (and academic\u000a      papers) that\u000a      result from the original research at Birmingham and forms part of the\u000a      intellectual property\u000a      foundation of GlySure, who also acquired patent 1 from Beckman Coulter.\u000a      Two recent papers (5\u000a      and 6) use the exact same glucose sensor in the first published \"device\u000a      format\".\u000a    Patent 1: \"Photo-induced electron transfer fluorescent sensor\u000a      molecules\".

Conventional technology to\u000a      visualise fingerprints on spent shell casings produced poor results\u000a      because of vaporisation of the sweat deposits during the firing process.\u000a      Fingerprint recovery rates were traditionally low (&lt;10%). The UoA's new\u000a      technology solves this problem, revealing previously undetectable\u000a      fingerprints on metal objects.\u000a    These technologies have economic and societal impact of substantive reach\u000a      and significance:\u000a    \u000a      improved fingerprint recovery rates which have helped police forensic\u000a        departments worldwide solve recent homicide investigations and re-open\u000a        previously closed \"cold\" cases.\u000a      development of new forensic products by commercial partners, now being\u000a        sold to forensic practitioners worldwide, stimulating the economy.\u000a      new policies and processes for forensic practitioners, which are now\u000a        standard operational procedure for police forces across the UK.\u000a    \u000a    1. Helping to tackle gun crime and further homicide investigations\u000a    The corrosion enhancement technology has been used in many\u000a      homicide investigations including Kingsland, GA; Killeen, TX; North\u000a      Richland Hills, TX; Tinley Park, IL; Marin County, CA [1,2]. It has been\u000a      used to examine evidence in more than 100 criminal cases in the US, UK and\u000a      Europe, including re-examination of evidence in a number of \"cold\" cases.\u000a      In 2012, evidence from the corrosion enhancement technique was heard [Bond]\u000a      and accepted by the Superior Court of the State of California, setting a\u000a      precedent in the US legal system [1,2].\u000a    2. Development of new forensic products\u000a    a) Consolite Forensics\u000a      The localised corrosion enhancement technology has been patented\u000a      [3] and commercialised with UK industrial partner Consolite\u000a      Forensics [4] through consultancy (Bond and Hillman;\u000a      2011-2013). The research helped the company develop the CERA LT, a new\u000a      optical system to recover fingerprints from gun cartridges, offering a\u000a      quick and simple to use product with a fully integrated high resolution\u000a      camera. The product is now commercially available for &#163;50,000 per unit.\u000a      The company launched the product in the summer of 2013, making its first\u000a      sale to the Granite Falls Police Department, Michigan USA. The product is\u000a      currently being trialled in other crime labs worldwide.\u000a    b) Foster and Freeman\u000a      Following patent filing [5], a similar commercialisation\u000a      partnership has been adopted to transfer the electrochromic polymer\u000a      film technology, with one of the world's foremost forensic science\u000a      equipment suppliers, Foster and Freeman [6]. A prototype instrument\u000a      developed via this partnership was undergoing testing as of July 2013. The\u000a      immediate target is to improve fingerprint detection on stainless steel, a\u000a      common material for knives; knife crime is a major area of concern in the\u000a      UK where guns are less readily available.\u000a    3. New processes, procedures and training for forensic practitioners\u000a      Historically, gun crime has been less prevalent in the UK than the US, but\u000a      a range of terrorist, drugs and organized crime threats make this a key\u000a      target for UK policing. Widespread uptake of the electrochromic\u000a        polymer fingerprint enhancement technology in the UK will benefit\u000a      from interactions with the Home Office (formerly HOSDB, now CAST). As a\u000a      result, both the corrosion and the electrochromic technologies have now\u000a      been incorporated as standard operational practice for police forces\u000a      across the UK through inclusion in the Home Office Fingerprint Manual\u000a      [7,8]. The research has given forensic practitioners new options for the\u000a      investigation of crime. The substantive impact of the localized\u000a        corrosion technology has been underpinned by Bond providing\u000a      consultancy training on the technology for practitioner organisations\u000a      (2009-2013) at: Home Office Biometrics Group; European Network of Forensic\u000a      Science Institutes; National Forensic Academy (Knoxville, TN); Southern\u000a      Californian Association of Fingerprint Examiners, Californian Department\u000a      of Justice; Santa Clara County Crime Laboratory, California; American\u000a      Association of Crime Scene Reconstruction; No. 1 Forensic Institute,\u000a      Beijing, China, with approximately 150 practitioners trained at each of\u000a      the seven events, reaching more than 1,000 in total.\u000a    Additional technology transfer activity and widening impact\u000a      Collaboration with the US Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS)\u000a      (2012-13) by Bond involved pseudo-operational trials of pipe bomb\u000a      fragments being sent to the University for fingerprint analysis and the\u000a      identification of fingerprints using these techniques. This represents a\u000a      natural expansion of the localised corrosion technology from shell\u000a      casings to other metals that have been subject to environmental extremes,\u000a      such as bomb fragments.\u000a    Dissemination has included Regional Development Agency Awards (Innovation\u000a      Fellowship and Follow-on Fund), practitioner-based conferences\u000a      (Iinternational Fingerprint Research Group: Sweden (2011) and Israel\u000a      (2013); Home Office meetings (2010-13)), extensive media coverage [9,10]\u000a      (including America's Most Wanted and CrimeWatch) and briefings to Police\u000a      Forces (invited events at the University 2011, 2012 and 2013, involving\u000a      the Forensic Science Special Interest Group of the Technology Strategy\u000a      Board).\u000a    Fingerprint corrosion on metal was recognised by Time Magazine as one of\u000a      the 50 best inventions of 2008 [9] and by BBC Focus Magazine (2009) as one\u000a      of the inventions most likely to change the world in 2009 and its\u000a      description by a detective from the North Richland Hills Police Department\u000a      as \"The new DNA\" [1].\u000a    The interdisciplinary nature of this field has been recognized via the\u000a      establishment (2012) of the Alec Jeffreys Forensic Science Institute\u000a      (AJFSI), led by Chemistry. This Institute has been created to fulfil the\u000a      need to bring together academics across diverse disciplines to tackle\u000a      current and emerging problems in forensic science.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Fingerprints remain the most conclusive means of linking an offender to a\u000a      crime scene.

Motivated by\u000a      this, Dr John Bond (then working at Northamptonshire Police but\u000a      also an Honorary Fellow of the University since 2007) and Professor\u000a        Robert Hillman undertook collaborative research blending interfacial\u000a      science and forensic expertise (2008-13). Their shared interests in\u000a      interfacial chemistry and surface analysis were focused on\u000a      characterization of thin films generated by and\/or directed by fingerprint\u000a      deposition. Fundamentally, this presents materials imaging challenges in\u000a      terms of 3D control of surface composition and properties at micro- and\u000a      nano-scales. With adequate control of the spatial resolution of these\u000a      processes, the uniqueness of the fingerprint can be preserved and captured\u000a      via permanent surface structures attributable to contact between the\u000a      finger and the substrate. This strategy was explored and exploited in two\u000a      ways: (i) using localised corrosion under the fingerprint ridges\u000a      to generate surface oxides with semiconducting properties and (ii) using\u000a      the fingerprint deposit as an insulating (inert) template to direct\u000a      electrochemically-driven deposition of electrochromic polymers to\u000a      regions of bare metal between the fingerprint ridges.\u000a    Localized corrosion strategy: Bond and Hillman showed that\u000a      fingerprint deposits on metals could, on relatively short timescales,\u000a      generate sufficient corrosion for the fingermark to be visualized long\u000a      after the fingerprint residue was removed or lost. Exploitation required\u000a      understanding and optimization of the underlying interfacial processes.\u000a      Topological and compositional imaging (from micro- to nano-scales) by\u000a      Hillman provided morphological insights into fingermark development,\u000a      veracity and sharpness [1,2]. Application to brass surfaces\u000a      (representative of bullet casings) revealed that oxide corrosion products\u000a      formed Schottky barrier diodes [1], whose electronic properties could be\u000a      exploited to bind coloured particulates electrostatically. Materials\u000a      property studies [3] revealed that Schottky barrier formation requires\u000a      dominance of one corrosion product (copper oxide or zinc oxide); chloride\u000a      concentration is a key determinant. Where neither oxide dominates, optical\u000a      interference effects attributable to the oxide layer permit non-invasive\u000a      visualization by colour mapping.\u000a    Electrochromic polymers: Hillman exploited the insulating\u000a      nature of the fingerprint deposit as a \"mask\" to direct the\u000a      electrochemical deposition of coloured electroactive polymers onto the\u000a      bare metal between the ridge deposits. The key fundamental feature is that\u000a      minute (nanometre) amounts of insulating material can (locally) prevent\u000a      the electron transfer required for electropolymerization, contrasting\u000a      favourably with the larger amounts of residual deposit required for the\u000a      physical \/chemical binding strategies of conventional latent fingerprint\u000a      enhancement methods (e.g. powders and cyanoacrylate polymerization). In a\u000a      totally novel extension, the use of electrochromic polymers (from\u000a      thiophene-, aniline- or pyrrole-based monomers) permits subsequent\u000a      manipulation of optical density and colour via applied potential [4,5],\u000a      providing excellent contrast on metals (Au, Pt, Pb, Ni, steel, brass) with\u000a      diverse surface chemistries, optical properties and operational\u000a      significance (precious objects, weapons, tools, metal theft). The\u000a      performance of the electrochromic technology has been explored for\u000a      fingerprint sweat deposits on metal subjected to diverse environmental\u000a      conditions (heat, immersion in water, soap and solvent treatment) and in\u000a      operationally significant scenarios found to be favourable over\u000a      conventional methodologies.

The work carried out at Bristol provides, for the first time,\u000a      an independent scientific\u000a      verification of UK emissions (a) submitted by Parties to the\u000a      Convention reporting under the\u000a      UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol. A verification section written by O'Doherty\u000a      is included in the\u000a      UNFCCC documentation (b). The UK, Australia and Switzerland are the\u000a      only countries to provide\u000a      such verification. This type of research was identified as an area of\u000a      importance at the UNFCCC,\u000a      Conference of the Parties (COP15), the Copenhagen Accord, where parties\u000a      were urged to \"ensure\u000a        sustained long-term operation of essential in situ networks through\u000a        provision of necessary\u000a        resources\".\u000a    Long-term monitoring of this kind is similarly important in assessing the\u000a      impact of international\u000a      policies related to control measures on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons\u000a      and\u000a      hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) introduced under the Montreal Protocol of\u000a      Substances that\u000a      Deplete the Ozone Layer. The effect of worldwide CFC controls can be seen\u000a      by decreases in the\u000a      long-term concentrations. Continued monitoring is required to assess the\u000a      overall success of the\u000a      Protocol leading to the recovery of the ozone layer, and the implications\u000a      for atmospheric levels of\u000a      replacement compounds such as HFCs (c).\u000a    The UK and international GHG reduction commitments, of which the\u000a      Bristol-led measurements\u000a      provide independent verification, translate into sector and company level\u000a      obligations which impact\u000a      across all regions of the UK. For example, there are a number of GHG\u000a      reporting schemes\u000a      applicable to businesses operating in the UK, such as the EU Emissions\u000a      Trading System and the\u000a      CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (a).\u000a    The atmospheric observations have helped DECC prioritise research to\u000a      improve the GHG\u000a      inventory. For example, emissions derived from measurements of N2O\u000a      have resulted in a large\u000a      research programme in Defra to better understand agricultural emissions\u000a      that result from the\u000a      application of man-made fertilizers. This gas is a potent GHG, with the\u000a      fourth largest climate effect\u000a      after CO2, CH4 and CFC-12 (d).\u000a    The information derived from this research will continue to inform\u000a      governments responsible for\u000a      formulating policies on climate change mitigation and adaption. In\u000a      addition, a much wider range of\u000a      organisations that are responsible for planning climate-sensitive\u000a      activities and investments will\u000a      benefit. For example, NERC recently funded an &#163;8.1m programme, \"Greenhouse\u000a      gas emissions\u000a      and feedbacks\" (O'Doherty and Rigby are co-investigators of\u000a      this multi-University consortium), to\u000a      increase the UK's ability to measure and predict sources and sinks of the\u000a      major anthropogenic\u000a      greenhouse gases.

For example, the analysis of\u000a      unregulated compound\u000a      NF3 (a powerful GHG showing a steady growth in the atmosphere)\u000a      was used by DECC as an\u000a      evidence base for international negotiations. NF3 was\u000a      subsequently included in the list of possible\u000a      new Kyoto Protocol gases due to its rapidly rising concentration and high\u000a      global-warming potential.\u000a    The Mace Head measurements have been used in a large number of\u000a      publications. This is widely\u000a      regarded as the `Gold Standard' dataset of European measurements. As such,\u000a      it has been central\u000a      to many European Union projects on verification of GHG emissions, such as\u000a      CarboEurope,\u000a      NitroEurope, Geomon, Eurohydros, ICOS, ACTRIS and InGOS.

Funded through a NERC Advanced Fellowship, Rigby (also\u000a      in the ACRG) is developing\u000a      methods for understanding global greenhouse gas emissions using AGAGE\u000a      observations and\u000a      chemical transport models.\u000a    The scientific highlights of Bristol's involvement with AGAGE, which are\u000a      important in furthering our\u000a      understanding of changes in global atmospheric composition, are summarised\u000a      below, with links to\u000a      the scientific outputs listed in Section 3 in brackets:\u000a    \u000a      The determination, from atmospheric observations, of global and\u000a        regional rates of emission\u000a        and destruction of natural and anthropogenic compounds that contribute\u000a        to climate change\u000a        and stratospheric ozone depletion (1-6).\u000a      Improved accuracy in our understanding of the global distributions and\u000a        temporal behaviours of\u000a        natural and anthropogenic gases in the global atmosphere (1-3,5).\u000a      The identification and accurate measurement of new greenhouse gases\u000a        and ozone-depleting\u000a        substances in the global atmosphere (eg the recently discovered\u000a        SO2F2, and high accuracy\u000a        measurement of NF3, C4F10, C5F12,\u000a        C6F14, C7F16 and C8F18)\u000a        (1,5).\u000a      Quantification of the oxidising capacity of the troposphere (5).\u000a    \u000a    The information derived from observational networks such as AGAGE has\u000a      resulted in regulation of\u000a      the production and use of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) under the\u000a      Montreal Protocol. The\u000a      rate of recovery of the ozone layer will depend critically on the rate of\u000a      decrease of ODSs, which will\u000a      be measured and interpreted by the AGAGE global network.\u000a    To support global climate legislation, it has been recognised that we\u000a      must develop the capability to\u000a      monitor greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at national scales. The School of\u000a      Chemistry at Bristol, in\u000a      collaboration with the Met Office, is at the very forefront of this\u000a      effort. The UK DECC Network, led\u000a      by O'Doherty and funded by DECC, is a unique national GHG\u000a      monitoring system, comprising four\u000a      stations (with two more being added in 2013) making high-frequency\u000a      measurements of key\u000a      atmospheric trace gases. Since 2010, GHGs have been measured at tall-tower\u000a      sampling sites at\u000a      Tacolneston (Norfolk, UK), Angus (Dundee, Scotland) and Ridge Hill\u000a      (Hereford, UK),\u000a      complementing the long-term record from Mace Head in Ireland. Analysis and\u000a      interpretation of\u000a      these observations using state-of-the-art \"inverse\" modelling techniques\u000a      enables the independent\u000a      assessment of the UK's adherence to the Montreal Protocol as implemented\u000a      by the Environmental\u000a      Protection (Controls on Ozone-Depleting Substances) Regulations (2011).\u000a      Furthermore, it\u000a      improves emissions estimation to UK Devolved Administration (DA) level and\u000a      provides verification\u000a      of the UK GHG emission inventories submitted annually to the United\u000a      Nations Framework\u000a      Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) under the Kyoto Protocol.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40239","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3355338","Name":"Namibia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2562770","Name":"Malta"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pancost and Shallcross recognised that through Bristol\u000a      ChemLabS, this research could serve as a powerful mechanism for engaging\u000a      students with chemistry as it: (i) highlights the importance of chemistry\u000a      in addressing some of the greatest societal challenges and (ii) inspires a\u000a      passion for all science through the innate interdisciplinarity of the\u000a      work. Thus, research has driven one of the world's most ambitious school\u000a      engagement efforts, co-ordinated by Shallcross and Harrison\u000a      (School of Chemistry Director of Outreach). ChemLabS has therefore\u000a      leveraged the quality, societal relevance and unique interdisciplinary\u000a      aspects of climate change research to inspire and motivate students to\u000a      become better engaged with their environment and pursue further education\u000a      and careers in science. The specific research components that inform\u000a      ChemLabS' outreach are the use of state-of-the-art analytical chemistry to\u000a      make sensitive measurements of gases in the atmosphere, the application of\u000a      physical and chemical principles to the modelling of atmospheric\u000a      chemistry, the chemistry underpinning air pollution and catalytic cycles,\u000a      and the use of paleoclimatic archives to determine the sensitivity of\u000a      global temperatures to pCO2.

Bristol ChemLabS has quantified the\u000a      impact with respect to: (i) uptake of this research in course curricula\u000a      and teaching, (ii) its effect on students' cognition, (iii) how it has\u000a      changed students' educational choices and (iv) cultural changes in\u000a      developing countries. With respect to (i), ChemLabS' teaching has now been\u000a      incorporated into UK national exam boards' coursework. Moreover, in one-\u000a      to two-year follow-up studies with 60 of the teachers who attended\u000a      ChemLabS' 2010 national teacher training day (the Festival of Contemporary\u000a      Science), 100% declared it either `very good' or `good' in terms of\u000a      usefulness to their teaching practice (f). With respect to (ii),\u000a      Bristol ChemLabS has studied the impact of its engagement activity on UK\u000a      school's understanding atmospheric chemistry (g). In terms of\u000a      (iii), via repeated visits and interactions with some schools, ChemLabS\u000a      has been able to study how its outreach activity has transformed students'\u000a      educational choices, eg the team has been visiting the Crypt\u000a      School in Gloucestershire for five years resulting in an increase from 5\u000a      to 60 students opting to study chemistry at A-Level, (h). Finally,\u000a      in terms of (iv), papers on the use of these climate-based educational\u000a      resources in the South African context are being published (i).\u000a    Overall, the impact of outreach on students, teachers and participating\u000a      postgraduates has been the subject of 15 papers published (j),\u000a      forming the basis of three postgraduate master's level theses where\u000a      Bristol ChemLabS has demonstrated that students' understanding of the\u000a      science underpinning climate change has been improved, that teachers'\u000a      confidence in teaching these topics has been increased and that student\u000a      aspirations have been raised.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Bristol ChemLabS (part of the School of Chemistry) has used School of\u000a      Chemistry research on the atmosphere (air quality, atmospheric chemistry\u000a      and the history of greenhouse gases on Earth) to enhance dramatically the\u000a      quality and uptake of chemistry education in the UK and approximately 20\u000a      other nations.

Its larger relevance is reflected in its policy impact;\u000a      the air quality research has been used by the UK Home Office and Ministry\u000a      of Defence to update their emergency-response models, and the\u000a      palaeoclimate research will be cited in the forthcoming Intergovernmental\u000a      Panel on Climate Change report.\u000a    One aspect of this research is the development of geochemical tools for\u000a      the reconstruction of past pCO2 levels and\u000a      temperatures, which is at the centre of assessing how carbon dioxide and\u000a      other greenhouse gases affect climate (1-3). The work illustrates\u000a      that throughout geological history, climate sensitivity (especially in\u000a      polar regions) is either at the high end of, or greater than, that assumed\u000a      for most climate models. For example, the Bristol researchers showed that\u000a      the Pliocene, widely considered an ideal analogue for anticipating future\u000a      warming (including by the IPCC), was characterised by pCO2\u000a      levels similar to those we had already achieved in 2000 but also by global\u000a      temperatures that were 3&#186;C warmer than those of today (1). Such\u000a      work will be included in the next IPCC report, an achievement facilitated\u000a      by Pancost co-hosting international workshops on pCO2\u000a      reconstruction at Bristol Zoo in 2010 and a Royal Society (RS)-funded\u000a      Kavli Meeting in 2011.\u000a    Related research has been led by Shallcross and is focussed on\u000a      air quality and pollutant dispersion and transformation (DAPPLE project,\u000a      2002-09) (4-6). Novel inert gas-phase tracers have been developed\u000a      that allow the characterisation of air flow and dispersion of pollutants\u000a      within the urban environment. These experiments have shown that robust,\u000a      simple models can be used for emergency-response planning, that pollution\u000a      from moving sources penetrates much further into the urban environment\u000a      than that from stationary sources and that outdoor pollution enters the\u000a      indoor environment in greater quantities than first thought and remains\u000a      there for longer than predicted. These findings, together with extensive\u000a      chemical modelling, have allowed us to build a more complete picture of\u000a      the complex urban environment and the chemical and physical\u000a      transformations that take place therein.\u000a    These are just two examples of the extensive research conducted on how\u000a      greenhouse gases (GHGs) are produced, behave in the atmosphere and affect\u000a      the Earth's climate, and how pollutants move and are transformed in the\u000a      urban environment. Additional research areas include investigating the\u000a      methane cycle in modern and ancient soils, wetlands and marine sediments,\u000a      quantifying trace GHGs in the atmosphere and understanding and\u000a      characterising pollutant transformation in the urban environment (5).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40240","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Introduction\u000d\u000a    The algorithms driving dS are taken from software and methods developed\u000d\u000a      by Glowacki in order to understand the fundamentals of chemical\u000d\u000a      reaction dynamics and energy transfer in liquids. This research occurred\u000d\u000a      as part of the EPSRC Programme Grant employing Glowacki, through\u000d\u000a      collaborations with Orr-Ewing and Ashfold. The exceptional\u000d\u000a      performance of the dS software benefits from a suite of GPU-accelerated\u000d\u000a      algorithms, developed by Glowacki in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      McIntosh-Smith and Tew, a resident at the Pervasive Media Studio in\u000d\u000a      Bristol.\u000d\u000a    Impact: Public Audiences\u000d\u000a    Glowacki recognised that combining his fast MD algorithms with\u000d\u000a      3D-depth sensors could facilitate an immersive, interactive molecular\u000d\u000a      dynamics experience. This led him to develop an integrated\u000d\u000a      software\/hardware system that functions as an installation piece for\u000d\u000a      cultural institutions. dS's sonic and graphic tools may be used by a range\u000d\u000a      of non-specialists, including artists, educators, and hobbyists.

It thus\u000d\u000a      offers a brilliant \"way in\" to complex chemistry and physics for people\u000d\u000a      who are often hard to reach, eg teenagers, clubbers,\u000d\u000a      festival-goers, and those interested in art. The majority of dS\u000d\u000a      participants indicate that they come from arts backgrounds, with little\u000d\u000a      exposure to science. Written feedback obtained over 21-22 July 2012 at the\u000d\u000a      Arnolfini suggests that dS sparks interest in science and the way that\u000d\u000a      scientists think.

For example, dS's recent London premier at the Barbican has provided\u000d\u000a      excellent exposure for both these institutions within the UK creative\u000d\u000a      technology sector. The Watershed have recently used dS as a \"Talent\u000d\u000a      Development Case Study\" detailing successful examples of\u000d\u000a      cross-fertilization between media organizations and the academic sector\u000d\u000a      and in collaboration with the Institute of Physics, dS's inspired the\u000d\u000a      Pervasive Media Studio to initiate a public communication of science\u000d\u000a      residency.\u000d\u000a    Impact: Non-Academics\u000d\u000a    dS and HF have had substantial impact on Glowacki's non-academic\u000d\u000a      collaborators. Following dS\/HF success:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Kriefman has enjoyed significant exposure, with invitations to conduct\u000d\u000a        workshops in collaboration with premier UK dance institutions including\u000d\u000a        the Royal Academy of Dance (London) and Northern Ballet.\u000d\u000a      Tew has boosted his international reputation as a generative digital\u000d\u000a        artist. He was awarded a Pervasive Media Studio residency, which led to\u000d\u000a        his participation in a MADE commission to work on a multi-site European\u000d\u000a        digital art project entitled \"Me and My Shadow\".\u000d\u000a      Hughes and Parish have produced a series of high-impact legacy film\u000d\u000a        documents detailing the groundbreaking collaboration that has resulted\u000d\u000a        in dS\/HF. For example, a dS mini-doc was recently shortlisted for a\u000d\u000a        $100k \"Forward Focus\" prize sponsored by GE (11).\u000d\u000a      The professional dancers who performed in HF have gained valuable\u000d\u000a        experience at the collaborative frontiers of art and science, and learnt\u000d\u000a        strategies for incorporating technology into arts practice. They have\u000d\u000a        improved their ability to engage public audiences in bringing hydbrid\u000d\u000a        forms of art to nontraditional audiences.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Impact: Commercial\u000d\u000a    dS has momentum for expansion into commercial sectors, with an initial\u000d\u000a      focus on education.

They introduced two methods (`event counting' and\u000d\u000a      `centroiding') in order to improve image resolution and alleviate a range\u000d\u000a      of problems that arise from using position sensitive detectors. The\u000d\u000a      methodology was first demonstrated in 1996 and reported in detail in 1998\u000d\u000a      (1,2). Such developments and the science they have enabled have\u000d\u000a      ensured membership in three successive EU Marie Curie Training Networks\u000d\u000a      devoted to developments and applications of imaging methods in\u000d\u000a      contemporary reaction dynamics (a-d) and event counting is now a\u000d\u000a      standard feature in the software supplied with CCD cameras provided for\u000d\u000a      imaging applications. Imaging methods are now being developed further\u000d\u000a      through a Knowledge Training Partnership with Photek Ltd, and were a key\u000d\u000a      tool within a recent EPSRC Programme Grant (e).\u000d\u000a    Strand 2 is an extensive set of Molecular Dynamics (MD)\u000d\u000a      simulation software programs developed by Glowacki, a Royal\u000d\u000a      Society URF (since October 2013) who has recently been appointed to a\u000d\u000a      proleptic lecturership in the School of Chemistry. From June 2009 to Sept\u000d\u000a      2013, Glowacki was employed as a PDRA on the aforementioned EPSRC\u000d\u000a      Programme Grant (e), where he was encouraged to work with a very\u000d\u000a      high degree of autonomy. Glowacki's software programs were\u000d\u000a      developed to understand hitherto unrecognised details of the mechanisms\u000d\u000a      for chemical reactions in liquids revealed by ultrafast laser experiments\u000d\u000a      performed by Laser Group at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's ULTRA\u000d\u000a      facility carried out during 2010\/11. Specifically, Glowacki\u000d\u000a      collaborated closely with Orr-Ewing and Ashfold to show\u000d\u000a      that chemical reactions in liquids give rise to products with significant\u000d\u000a      quantum state excitation (3,4). Through the extensive conversations\u000d\u000a      that arose as a result of this collaboration, Glowacki became\u000d\u000a      aware of the in-house experience with imaging methods, and recognised the\u000d\u000a      possibility of combining real-time imaging methodology with his molecular\u000d\u000a      dynamics algorithms to build a real-time interactive system. This inspired\u000d\u000a      Glowacki to investigate combining his MD methods with 3D imaging\u000d\u000a      technology. These efforts were initially funded via an EPSRC\u000d\u000a      public engagement grant awarded in October 2010 (f), and EPSRC\u000d\u000a      Pathways to Impact funding in 2011 (g). The most significant\u000d\u000a      complication arose from the computational requirements of such a system\u000d\u000a      which dramatically exceeded what could be accomplished with standard\u000d\u000a      single-core processing methods. As a result, Glowacki began\u000d\u000a      conversations with McIntosh-Smith (Senior Lecturer, UoB Department of\u000d\u000a      Computer Science) with expertise in high-performance computing. This\u000d\u000a      collaboration, initiated in early 2012, led to a set of GPU-accelerated\u000d\u000a      algorithms for performing real-time interactive molecular dynamics (5,6)\u000d\u000a      and now forms the foundation of the dS system.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40243","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Chemical archaeology\u000a      Evershed began to combine chemistry and archaeology to capture\u000a      public interest and stimulate\u000a      chemistry education in the 1990s and has continued to evolve this to the\u000a      present day via the full\u000a      range of mechanisms.

The Bristol-based PhD student (Woodbury)\u000a      developed a\u000a      new method for detecting the adulteration of corn oil which was\u000a      incorporated into the CODEX\u000a      Standard for Named Vegetable Oils (CODEX-STAN 210-1999) (h). The\u000a      CODEX was published in\u000a      1999, but remains the UK (and international) standard for detecting\u000a      vegetable oil adulteration,\u000a      thereby protecting consumers' economic and health interests through the\u000a      REF period. Evershed's\u000a      methodologies predate the recent horse meat debacle, emphasising the need\u000a      for the use of\u000a      sophisticated analytical methods to ensure the quality of the food we\u000a      consume. Although such\u000a      frauds are rarely injurious to human health they raise moral concerns,\u000a      however, the famous\u000a      \"Spanish Toxic Oil Syndrome\" resulted in 600 deaths, emphasising the need\u000a      for constant vigilance.\u000a    Murder case\u000a      Approached by the Metropolitan Police, Evershed's team rapidly\u000a      reconfigured their methodologies\u000a      to provide unequivocal evidence that led to an immediate confession and\u000a      subsequent murder\u000a      conviction (i). The methods employed were published (6) with\u000a      the agreement of the Metropolitan\u000a      Police in 2009 to provide an exemplar for others to follow. The case\u000a      rested on the substantial\u000a      stable isotope database built on Evershed's archaeological\u000a      chemical research, bolstered by\u000a      further samples provided by the \"Body Farm\", made famous by\u000a      Patricia Cornwall's novel of the\u000a      same name.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Evershed and his research group in The School of Chemistry,\u000a      University of Bristol, have\u000a      pioneered a suite of novel molecular and stable isotope analytical\u000a      chemical techniques for\u000a      provenancing amorphous organic residues in archaeology, particularly for\u000a      the elucidation of\u000a      ancient diet and the origins of agriculture.

He is one of the\u000a      pioneers of the use of cutting-edge chromatographic and mass spectrometric\u000a      approaches for\u000a      interrogation, at the molecular level, of organic residues\u000a      preserved in archaeological materials. His\u000a      group's discoveries have provided unequivocal evidence for the widespread\u000a      occurrence of\u000a      biomolecules of both original and modified structures in a variety of\u000a      amorphous organic\u000a      archaeological deposits, human, plant and animal remains, sediments and\u000a      artefacts. Critically, his\u000a      team were the first to recognise in the 1990s the hitherto untapped\u000a      potential of the compound-\u000a      specific stable carbon isotope ratio technique to archaeological science.\u000a      These approaches have\u000a      been widely adopted by not only archaeologists but researchers in a wide\u000a      variety of other fields.\u000a      Notably, Evershed and a PhD student (Woodbury) working with\u000a      the food industry (primarily\u000a      Rossell, Leatherhead Food Research Association, LFRA) provided one of the\u000a      first examples of the\u000a      use of these methodologies to detect food fraud; most importantly they\u000a      developed and applied a\u000a      highly robust method (e.g. (3) and references therein) which has\u000a      been adopted as the standard\u000a      method (INTERNATIONAL CODEX) for detecting commercial vegetable oil\u000a      adulteration to the\u000a      present day. Recognising the wider utility of their approach, and when\u000a      called upon, they applied\u000a      the technique (with Bull and Berstan, Bristol) with the\u000a      Metropolitan Police to secure a murder\u000a      conviction (6).\u000a    The Bristol group led by Evershed has continued to develop the\u000a      archaeological applications of\u000a      these techniques very extensively, to show how molecular and isotopic\u000a      information contained in\u000a      such residues can answer fundamental questions concerning early\u000a      agriculture and ancient diet,\u000a      specifically concerning man's relationships with the domesticated animals.\u000a      The following high\u000a      profile studies underpin the impact of this research. A landmark paper\u000a      appeared in Science in 1998\u000a      (1) and led to a series of papers culminating in a report in Nature\u000a      (2) of the earliest chemically-based direct proof of milk use, from the oldest pottery in Europe\u000a      and the Near East, dating to\u000a      nearly 9,000 years ago. This had major ramifications for our understanding\u000a      of the production and\u000a      processing of this key staple by early pastoralists, who overcame the\u000a      health impacts of lactose\u000a      intolerance by processing milk to resduce the lactose content of the dairy\u000a      products they consumed.\u000a      This is further emphasised in two recent high profile papers in Nature\u000a      which demonstrated the first\u000a      evidence for dairying in Saharan Africa (4)&#8224; and for\u000a      cheese-making in northern Europe (5)&#8224;, both\u000a      around 7,500 years ago. These studies are exemplars of the chemical and\u000a      stable isotope\u000a      `fingerprinting' concept which links environmental and metabolic isotope\u000a      signals to specific lipid\u000a      structures, and underpins the wider application of these approaches in the\u000a      food quality assurance\u000a      and forensic fields. These far reaching applications have stimulated\u000a      worldwide public and\u000a      academic interest and provide the basis for the diverse impacts listed in\u000a      Section 4.\u000a    &#8224;These two articles have been viewed nearly 30,000 times on the journal\u000a      website since their publication\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40244","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    There are three sites of impact:\u000a    AstraZeneca\u000a    This company can now identify ligands for transition metal catalysis\u000a      (mostly with Pd, Rh, Ru and Ir) more efficiently. The Ligand Knowledge\u000a      Base principal component analysis feeds into a Design of Experiment\u000a      programme that defines the `chemical space' within which ligands will be\u000a      tested and how most efficiently to explore this space.

The Ligand Knowledge Base aims to capture the properties of\u000a    donor ligands coordinating to transition metal centres by way of a\u000a    collection of up to 29 descriptors. The descriptors evaluated and used are\u000a    computationally-derived from a range of coordination environments in order\u000a    to maximise their transferability and hence utility for the investigation of\u000a    the ligands. These descriptors are analysed using different statistical\u000a    approaches, both individually to determine their chemical context, and\u000a    collectively by principal component analysis thereby allowing the derivation\u000a    of maps of `ligand space' for different ligand sets.\u000a    Lloyd-Jones acted as a consultant to AstraZeneca Process Research\u000a      and Development during 2003-2010. Through discussion with Process Research\u000a      and Development scientists at the AstraZeneca Avlon and Charnwood sites,\u000a      it became evident that catalyst discovery and optimisation for medicinal\u000a      chemistry projects and scale-up, predominantly involving Pd-based systems,\u000a      was heavily dependent on, or influenced by, statistical or anecdotal\u000a      approaches. It was proposed that with funding from AstraZeneca, the Ligand\u000a      Knowledge Base could: (i) be substantially increased in ligand class,\u000a      ligand space, and ligand population density and (ii) be applied to model\u000a      systems for the types of Pd-coupling process that were of interest to\u000a      AstraZeneca so that the feasibility of qualitative and quantitative\u000a      analysis and prediction of the effect of ligand structure on the catalytic\u000a      activity could be explored. Between 2006 and 2010 AstraZeneca provided\u000a      &#163;763k to fund this research in the laboratories of Lloyd-Jones and\u000a      Orpen, Harvey and Fey at Bristol (2).

One beneficial impact is that 81 additional\u000a      biogas installations have been\u000a      deployed on sites that generate on average 2-3 MW of green energy per year\u000a      each, enabling the\u000a      UK to better meet its target under the Climate Change Act of 2009 [see\u000a      Section 5, C1].\u000a    There are also economic benefits in a number of areas, such as growth in\u000a      turnover, increased\u000a      graduate-level employment with accompanying HMRC returns, reduction in the\u000a      balance sheet\u000a      provision PpTek has to make for replacement parts, increased income from\u000a      servicing and\u000a      expansion of the client base overseas.\u000a    In 2008, the turnover of PpTek was &#163;910,000.

In 2008, PpTek was required to make financial\u000a      provision for the failure or\u000a      recall of part of their systems [TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION] for the five UK\u000a      installations. By 2012,\u000a      provision by PpTek had fallen to [TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION] for 11 units installed.\u000a    This fall in the provision is due to the analysis at Sussex and in\u000a      particular the complex analysis of\u000a      the compounds blinding the media from the incoming biogas. The resulting\u000a      changes in processes\u000a      and equipment design by PpTek has enabled them to argue scientifically the\u000a      case that the cause\u000a      of failure was the species contained in the biogas stream and not the\u000a      failure of the media. In\u000a      product design, PpTek have been able to reduce the amount of media used in\u000a      each system, giving\u000a      savings in its large systems [TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION].\u000a    Similar improvements have taken place in the income derived from\u000a      servicing installations:\u000a      [TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION]. Without the ability to deploy on progressively more\u000a      chemically difficult\u000a      sites, these increases would not have materialised.

Collaborative research between PpTek and\u000a      Sussex has been\u000a      focused on deploying an optimised photocatalytic system as the successor\u000a      technology for PpTek's\u000a      current absorption process. Such an approach has many advantages, not\u000a      least in the energy\u000a      requirement for purification, which will be much lower than the current\u000a      thermal-regeneration\u000a      methods. The capture of solar energy by semiconductors, whereby\u000a      hole-electron pairs are\u000a      generated and can then be used, either as charge carriers for electricity\u000a      generation or directly\u000a      harnessed in chemical transformations, is well known. Optimisation of the\u000a      spectrum captured,\u000a      through a combination of the control of morphology at the nanoscale,\u000a      layering or doping, is an\u000a      attractive method of effecting the redox transformations of components of\u000a      gas streams. Moreover,\u000a      in an industrial setting where gas flows are of the order of 103\u000a      m3 hr-1 and where the duty cycle of a\u000a      catalytic bed is measured in days or months, the physical nature of the\u000a      catalyst is critically\u000a      important. Focusing on TiO2 as a base material for the\u000a      morphological manipulation of the band gap\u000a      and chemical doping, Turner and Chen have developed and optimised the\u000a      generation of physically\u000a      robust mats and beds of nanofibres [see Section 3, R1] that display strong\u000a      photocatalytic\u000a      properties. This applied and collaborative research is based on\u000a      more-fundamental studies of\u000a      nanostructured TiO2 [R2] and its photocatalytic properties\u000a      [R3,R4].\u000a    Initially funded by EPSRC through a CASE award to PpTek and Sussex, we\u000a      demonstrated the\u000a      oxidative power of TiO2 in the removal of volatile organic\u000a      compounds from a gas stream under\u000a      laboratory conditions. This EPSRC-funded work secured the basis for a\u000a      grant from the Technology\u000a      Strategy Board (TSB) for the production of a pilot-scale prototype that\u000a      will be capable of operating\u000a      under the conditions in the field and over a variety of different biogas\u000a      sources &#8212; including sewage\u000a      plants, digestors and landfill sites.\u000a    A key strand of both the EPSRC- and the TSB-funded research has been an\u000a      analysis of the\u000a      current processes of purification and regeneration, as the successor\u000a      technology under\u000a      development must be deployed with minimum disruption to the current\u000a      installations. The results of\u000a      this process of research and analysis have directly affected PpTek's\u000a      current practice and the\u000a      current IP under development has been a significant asset in adding value\u000a      to the company, leading\u000a      to acquisition talks with a major multinational that are currently\u000a      on-going.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42242","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Background\u000d\u000a    Argenta came into being when a team of two dozen highly experienced\u000d\u000a      scientists from the former Aventis Pharmaceuticals (formerly Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc\u000d\u000a      Rorer) Research Centre in Dagenham, led by Dr Christopher Newton set out\u000d\u000a      to raise money to become a pharmaceutical contract research organisation\u000d\u000a      (CRO).

Following further grant\u000d\u000a      support from EPSRC [G2, G3] key outcomes from the collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc Rorer were the discovery and development at Imperial of a\u000d\u000a      range of new techniques for parallel synthesis [1-6] and the training of\u000d\u000a      16 postdoctoral medicinal chemists in the methods of parallel synthesis.\u000d\u000a      The new techniques embodied methods for purification-minimised parallel\u000d\u000a      synthesis, which are crucial in the early stages of drug discovery.\u000d\u000a      Parallel, or high-throughput, synthesis renders routine the exploration of\u000d\u000a      extended areas of chemical space in the search for new medicinal\u000d\u000a      molecules, to an extent which was previously unviable because of the time\u000d\u000a      and resources needed. The most significant of these methods is the use of\u000d\u000a      ring-opening metathesis polymerisation (ROMP) for the fabrication of\u000d\u000a      polymer-supported reagents and catalysts: ROMPgels and ROMPspheres. This\u000d\u000a      innovative synthesis methodology enables the fabrication of novel, highly\u000d\u000a      functionalised polymeric supports by simple and efficient methods which\u000d\u000a      use readily available precursors. These functional polymers are used in\u000d\u000a      fundamentally important organic synthesis reactions such as alkene\u000d\u000a      formation and nucleophilic displacement, with the undesired by-products\u000d\u000a      being easy to separate from the soluble desired products simply by virtue\u000d\u000a      of being chemically attached to the insoluble polymeric material, which is\u000d\u000a      removed by filtration at the end of the process. This approach facilitates\u000d\u000a      parallel synthesis, in which multiple versions of a generic chemical\u000d\u000a      structure may be made simultaneously using automated and semi-automated\u000d\u000a      techniques. The research on ROMPgels was described as being of\u000d\u000a      \"outstanding interest,\" (Flynn, D.L.; Hanson, P.R.; Berk, S.C.; Makara,\u000d\u000a      G.M. Current Opinion in Drug Discovery and Development 2002,\u000d\u000a      5, 571) and was highlighted in Chemical and Engineering News\u000d\u000a      (Borman, S. Chem. Eng. News 2002, No. 11, p. 43).\u000d\u000a    In a related method, a polymer-supported transition metal catalyst which\u000d\u000a      promotes the joining together of two alkenes to make a new, more complex\u000d\u000a      alkene together with ethylene as a volatile by-product was developed. The\u000d\u000a      transition metal catalyst is again immobilised by chemical attachment to\u000d\u000a      an insoluble polymeric support. One of the alkenes in solution reacts with\u000d\u000a      the solid-supported catalyst to form a first reactive intermediate in\u000d\u000a      solution, which then combines with the second alkene to give the desired\u000d\u000a      product alkene, together with a second reactive intermediate. This second\u000d\u000a      intermediate recombines with the polymeric support to give ethylene gas,\u000d\u000a      regenerating the solid-supported catalyst. The active transition metal\u000d\u000a      catalyst immobilised on the polymeric support is thus released temporarily\u000d\u000a      into solution, where it affects the synthesis of the desired alkene prior\u000d\u000a      to recapture by the polymer. This release-and-catch concept was termed\u000d\u000a      `boomerang' catalysis, and is significant in that it minimises transition\u000d\u000a      metal contamination of the alkene products.\u000d\u000a    Finally, polymer-supported esters were converted into highly reactive\u000d\u000a      alkenes, which entered into reaction sequences for the formation of\u000d\u000a      all-carbon cyclic compounds as well as sulfur-containing heteroaromatic\u000d\u000a      substances. Product purity was enhanced by being able to wash away\u000d\u000a      impurities and by-products at each stage of the sequence.\u000d\u000a    The research and outputs described above and in section 3 arose entirely\u000d\u000a      out of Imperial research [2, 3, 5, 6] or collaboration with Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc\u000d\u000a      Rorer [1, 4].\u000d\u000a    Key personnel:\u000d\u000a    A.G.M.

MV has provided &gt; 50 person years of employment\u000a      for its own, primarily PhD-level, UK graduates and it has also supported\u000a      training activities, paying MBA fees for one of its Principal Scientists,\u000a      a CASE studentship at Imperial College, and a contribution to EPSRC KTS\u000a      project costs for two postdoctoral researchers seconded from Imperial\u000a      College and a Principal Scientist seconded to Imperial College. This\u000a      represents a direct economic impact through investment funding for new\u000a      activities, jobs created and protected, and turnover associated with new\u000a      and improved services.\u000a    MV has additionally been an important component in developing momentum\u000a      for the creation of a UK Plastic Electronics industry [A], being one of\u000a      two Plastic Electronics companies based in Central London. In 2008 MV was\u000a      starting to be recognized as a \"successful multi-million pound\u000a        enterprise\" [B], being the focus of an article in The Engineer [C]\u000a      and a September 2008 visit by Phil Willis MP, then Chair of the House of\u000a      Commons Innovation, Universities and Skills (IUSS) Committee, as part of\u000a      the Committee's Engineering Inquiry [D, B]. In August 2008, joint\u000a      development partner Acrongenomics (an investment and commercialization\u000a      company listed on the USA Nasdaq) took a &#163;1.1M equity position in MV [E].\u000a      Commenting on the deal Platon Tzouvalis, President of Acrongenomics, said,\u000a      \"This is a great day for our company. This agreement with Molecular\u000a        Vision is a major milestone for Acrongenomics, since it marks our\u000a        substantial sharing in everything that this technology has to\u000a        offer...This will allow Acrongenomics and Molecular Vision to focus on\u000a        the goals of developing the technology and bringing great products to\u000a        the market, thus increasing our shareholder value and substantially\u000a        contributing to the betterment of the healthcare system in general\"\u000a      [E].\u000a    In February 2009, Peter Woodford, a diagnostics industry veteran of 35\u000a      years standing, including 15 years with Roche Diagnostics, joined the\u000a      company as Chairman saying \"I am excited by the clear potential of\u000a        Molecular Vision's technology platform\" [F]. In September 2009 MV\u000a      raised an additional &#163;2m from Imperial Innovations and other investors\u000a      including Acrongenomics to further the commercial development of the\u000a      BioLED technology platform [G]. A significant contract with \"a global\u000a        cosmetic company\" was also announced in 2009 [G]. In 2010 MV\u000a      launched the development of its CardioPlex fluorescence based triple test\u000a      for cardiac markers myoglobin, CK-MB and troponin-I, concluding a\u000a      successful demonstration in 2011. In 2011, Imperial Innovations invested a\u000a      further &#163;750k and MV announced the appointment of Chris Hand as CEO [H].\u000a      In 2012, Abingdon Health Group (AHG) led a &#163;3M investment round in which\u000a      it acquired a 50.1% stake in MV. As part of the same deal, Imperial\u000a      Innovations invested in AHG, widening its portfolio of healthcare sector\u000a      investments [I]. Recently, agreements have been put in place with a\u000a      leading European pharmaceutical company and a large multi-national\u000a      chemical company to co-develop point-of-care diagnostic tests in the UK\u000a      [J].\u000a    2) Health Care Benefits\u000a    MV has pioneered a novel microanalysis technology that offers a step\u000a      change opportunity for point- of-care in-vitro diagnostics. In particular,\u000a      MV's BioLED platform provides a simple-to-use, portable, low-cost, rapid,\u000a      quantitative diagnostic tool. It allows efficient, accurate, multi-analyte\u000a      measurement in a generic format that can utilize absorption, turbidity,\u000a      fluorescence, phosphorescence and chemiluminescence detection schemes with\u000a      existing assays on blood, saliva and urine samples and at the cost of a\u000a      few dollars, i.e. some 1000-times lower than the typical bench-top readers\u000a      with which it competes in terms of sensitivity and accuracy. The\u000a      availability of such devices as routine tools in general practice would\u000a      directly address key objectives of health providers in the UK, Europe and\u000a      the US, notably: (i) reduced treatment time; (ii) improved quality of\u000a      treatment; (iii) reduced inequality of treatment by extending facilities\u000a      available to remote surgeries; and (iv) improved ongoing care via\u000a      home-based preventative and post-treatment monitoring of at-risk patients\u000a      [K]. The BioLED platform has the potential to become a de facto\u000a      standard for medical testing and the significance of this disruptive\u000a      technology was recognized by AHG in March 2012 when they acquired a\u000a      majority shareholding in MV. Abingdon founder Dr Chris Hand commented \"This\u000a        is an important step towards our strategy of creating a fully\u000a        functional, specialist diagnostics business. Early detection is critical\u000a        for improved treatment outcomes and there is a significant need for\u000a        simple, faster and more accurate point of care tests. Working with some\u000a        of the world's leading experts we are developing disruptive technologies\u000a        and are well placed to take a share of the US$11.2bn global\u000a        immunodiagnostics market\" [I]. In a later comment for Wired\u000a      Magazine, in which MV technology featured as \"One of the Big Ideas for\u000a      2012\", he added \"If you can test someone in an ambulance on their way\u000a        to hospital, or in A&amp;E, that's a big benefit. It's all about getting\u000a        care to the patient more quickly and efficiently\" [L]. In a letter\u000a      Dr Hand states \"I believe that the Molecular Vision technology offers\u000a        us a current and future competitive advantage in the diagnostics sector.\u000a        It allows us to expand current markets, and with similarities to our\u000a        previous activities at Cozart, allows us to create new, currently\u000a        untapped markets for the benefits of the user, the patient and the\u000a        healthcare system\" [J].\u000a    In addition to the medical diagnostics market, the BioLED technology is\u000a      also suited to environmental testing including water quality ($4Bn\u000a      market), homeland security\/biodefence including pathogen detection ($8Bn\u000a      market), veterinary testing including bovine TB ($2Bn market) and\u000a      substances of abuse testing ($2Bn market) [M].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Molecular Vision Ltd (\"MV\"), which was spun-out of Imperial Innovations,\u000a      develops simple-to-use, point-of-care diagnostic devices (known as the\u000a      BioLED&#8482; platform) that quickly produce lab-quality information from a\u000a      single sample of bodily fluids.

This innovation was informed by long-term\u000a      research undertaken by Bradley and John de Mello on organic light emitting\u000a      diodes (OLEDs) and photodiodes (OPDs) and by Andrew de Mello on\u000a      microfluidic chip structures. The resulting Imperial College intellectual\u000a      property (IP), focused on the combination of OLEDs and OPDs with\u000a      microfluidic structures, is protected by granted patents including GB\u000a      2369428, US 6,995,348 and EP 1336089, assigned to MV by Imperial\u000a      Innovations.\u000a    Initial research at Imperial College underpinning the BioLED technology\u000a      was funded by EPSRC [G1] and by MV, supported by a BBSRC Small Business\u000a      Research Initiative grant [G2]. This involved both Imperial College and MV\u000a      staff and Imperial students using facilities in the College. It proved the\u000a      principle of the BioLED platform and demonstrated the competitive\u000a      performance of OLED and OPD instrumented microfluidic structures. The\u000a      first application of polymer OLEDs as light sources for microchip based\u000a      fluorescence detection, the fabrication of dye-doped microfluidic\u000a      structures that integrate an efficient long-pass filter function and the\u000a      use of polymer OPDs as detectors for microscale chemiluminescence resulted\u000a      from this work [1-3].\u000a    By mid-2006, MV had signed a development contract with Acrongenomics Inc\u000a      to work on kidney function, cardiac markers and sexually transmitted\u000a      diseases, with an initial focus on the detection of microalbuminuria (a\u000a      kidney disorder). It had also moved into the Imperial Bioincubator to\u000a      establish its own &gt; &#163;275K R&amp;D facilities to develop BioLED\u000a      prototypes and test them on bodily fluids. Bradley and Andrew de Mello\u000a      were appointed Founder Directors and John de Mello Chief Scientific\u000a      Officer (CSO), later joining the MV Board also. Close research\u000a      collaborations between the founders and MV have continued until the\u000a      present day and resulted in a further 2 BioLED focused journal papers\u000a      (DOI: 10.1016\/j.snb.2004.10.005 and 10.1039\/b313503a, 133 ISI citations).\u000a      These address the use of polymer OPDs as detectors for microscale\u000a      chemiluminescent antioxidant capacity screening (2009) and an optimized\u000a      system for fluorescence immunoassays for cardiac markers myoglobin and\u000a      CK-MB as an early diagnostic of myocardial infarction (2011). Additional\u000a      work and publications between Imperial and MV have covered the development\u000a      of low cost, high performance optical filter technology for use with\u000a      diode-based sensors, see e.g. [4]. MV also secured NHS Health Technology\u000a      Device funding for collaboration with Imperial, Acrongenomics and Pearson\u000a      Matthews &#8212; a design development company specializing in the healthcare\u000a      sector &#8212; to develop prototype diagnostic devices. A PDA-based USB powered\u000a      demo was shown in early 2007 and a battery powered version with a built-in\u000a      display followed late the same year. Eight conference papers also resulted\u000a      from the BioLED focused research at Imperial between 2004 and 2008.\u000a    A second strand of research concerned materials development and\u000a      fabrication methods for OLED and OPD devices, respectively vapour-phase\u000a      polymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (VPP- PEDOT) as an\u000a      ITO-replacement electrode and interlayer lithography [5,6]; funded by\u000a      [G1]. The resulting fabrication IP was the subject of a patent filing\u000a      GB\/GB0523437.2 that was successfully licensed (July 2007) to MV for use in\u000a      the medical diagnostic sector. This research underpinned the development\u000a      of flexible substrate devices that enabled the participation of MV in\u000a      contract work for Microfluidic ChipShop and sub-contracted work for\u000a      Cambridge Display Technology (TSB OPALS project). In 2007, a Royal Society\u000a      Brian Mercer Award for Innovation to Bradley and John de Mello [G3]\u000a      co-funded a project with MV and Imperial Innovations to develop further\u000a      the interlayer lithography method and a stamp transfer printing process\u000a      that had been developed by Bradley and co-workers in the physics\u000a      department.

Marshall resigned his lectureship\u000a      position in December 2009 to join the Company full-time (Gibson having\u000a      previously taken a visiting professorship at Imperial when he joined BP as\u000a      their Chief Chemist in 2008). The basis of Plaxica's technology is\u000a      fully-owned by the Company. Nonetheless, the insight into the market and\u000a      the understanding of the capabilities arose from academic work at Imperial\u000a      over a number of years, and ultimately proved necessary when seeking funds\u000a      for the launch of the spin-out company.\u000a    Plaxica is a process technology licensing company. It develops,\u000a      demonstrates and designs process plants for the production of the key\u000a      intermediates, especially L- and D- lactic acids and lactides, for\u000a      stereocomplex polylactic acid (PLA) &#8212; a high performance biopolymer made\u000a      from non-food renewable materials, such as cellulosic based materials.\u000a      Plaxica's technology allows high performance PLA to replace traditional\u000a      polymers produced from oil. It has a flexible approach to how it interacts\u000a      with licensees, recognising that a successful biopolymers operation\u000a      requires technology in the areas of feedstock production and conversion,\u000a      intermediates production and polymerisation. Plaxica focuses on the\u000a      ability to credibly scale up the chemical processes developed on a lab\u000a      scale. Using a multidisciplinary team of chemists, process engineers and\u000a      technical consultants the team works to deliver the correct balance of\u000a      innovation, capital and operating costs. Before the launch of Plaxica, the\u000a      UK had no commercial interest in the production of PLA, though several\u000a      distributors could supply it.\u000a    Plaxica was formed to commercialise strong IP in low cost, high\u000a      performance bioplastics. The product is a greener, cleaner and stronger\u000a      form of plastic made from natural feedstock and can be used for a variety\u000a      of applications including for example, fibres and packaging. It is \"developing\u000a        next generation biopolymers that will be both cheaper to produce and\u000a        have improved properties compared with first generation biopolymers. The\u000a        novel chemistry underpinning this technology came from research by\u000a        Professor Vernon Gibson FRS and Dr Ed Marshall at Imperial College\u000a        London. Plaxica's technology uses sustainable feedstocks to produce a\u000a        biopolymer known as polylactic acid (PLA) using more energy-efficient\u000a        processes, to produce a stronger, higher-quality polymer. The result\u000a        should be a low-cost, environmentally-friendly biopolymer for use in\u000a        applications as diverse as packaging, textiles, electronics and\u000a        automobile parts\" [C].\u000a    Since its formation in 2008 Plaxica has had several successful funding\u000a      rounds and key milestones. Imperial Innovations funded the initial launch\u000a      of the company in 2008. A project involving Plaxica, Imperial and\u000a      Holloid Plastics Ltd won funding for the High Value Manufacturing\u000a      Technology Strategy Board in September 2009 [D], leading to\u000a      conditions for the successful injection moulding of stereocomplex PLA. In\u000a      October 2009 Plaxica received &#163;1m in equity funding from Imperial\u000a      Innovations, the Carbon Trust Investments Ltd and the National Endowment\u000a      for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) [C]. Commenting on the\u000a      investment the CEO of Imperial Innovations Group plc, Susan Searle, said \"Existing\u000a        plastics are no longer sustainable because of the oil they use and the\u000a        waste they leave. This investment will help Plaxica develop a low-cost\u000a        and environmentally friendly alternative for a wide range of industrial\u000a        and consumer applications\" [C]. Rachael Nutter, Investment Manager\u000a      at Carbon Trust Investment Partners LLP commented \"The rapidly growing\u000a        market for bioplastics and Plaxica's position as a leader in this field\u000a        have made it an exciting company to invest in. Plaxica has the potential\u000a        to transform the cost and carbon footprint of PLAs and develop new\u000a        applications for this polymer\" [C]. This equity investment allowed\u000a      Plaxica to \"continue developing processes aimed at reducing PLA\u000a        production costs to the point where it can compete with mass volume\u000a        oil-based plastics\" [C]. In 2010 Plaxica announced that it\u000a      raised a further &#163;3 million in a Series A financing in which all existing\u000a      institutional investors participated. The funds were used to accelerate\u000a      development and scale up of the company's next generation PLA technology\u000a      [E]. The funding consists of &#163;1.2m Imperial Innovations) and &#163;1.8m from\u000a      other existing shareholders [E]. In 2011 Plaxica completed a &#163;5m\u000a      round in Series B financing with investment from Imperial Innovations,\u000a      Invesco Perpetual and NESTA Investment [F]. In 2010, Plaxica began to rent\u000a      space in the Wilton Research Centre on Teesside to focus on process\u000a      development, scale-up and demonstration. By September 2012 the\u000a      demonstration facility had entered the commissioning phase [20\/9\/12\u000a      announcement, G]. By May 2013 \"Plaxica [had] demonstrated the\u000a        production of extremely high purity D-lactic acid from a racemic lactic\u000a        acid feedstock, validating [their] Optipure enantiomer separation\u000a        technology\" [30\/5\/13 announcement, G] and had attracted commercial\u000a      interest from a number of clients and partners, especially in South East\u000a      Asia and North America [H]. The product quality exceeded industry\u000a      standards for polymer-grade lactic acid which was \"an important\u000a        milestone in the validation of Plaxica's low cost technology for the\u000a        production of lactic acid\" [30\/5\/13 announcement, G]. In total\u000a      Plaxica has raised almost &#163;10m in investment in the 2008-2013 REF period.\u000a      It continues to attract investment as demonstrated by the recent &#163;8M\u000a      Series C financing round [10\/9\/13 announcement, G, H].\u000a    Plaxica currently employs 27 people covering R&amp;D, engineering, plant\u000a      operation and commercial functions. This includes 18 people in Wilton in\u000a      the North East of England. Since 2008 Plaxica have employed 25 UK\u000a      graduates in STEM subjects [H]. Further support is provided as required\u000a      from a retained team of ca. 10 consultants (industry and academic\u000a      experts).\u000a    The construction of a pilot demonstration facility in Teesside\u000a      demonstrates Plaxica's commitment to creating jobs and revenue within the\u000a      UK. Examples of the local press include:\u000a    \u000a      \"The licensing company, which develops transformational biopolymer\u000a          technology, only moved into the Wilton Centre 18 months ago but has\u000a          already had to take another laboratory and a large open plan office,\u000a          in addition to its existing lab and two small offices.\" [I]\u000a      \"A technology and licensing company is doubling the size of its\u000a          Teesside operation with the launch of a pilot plant that will\u000a          demonstrate the conversion of bio-renewables into polymers using\u000a          break-through technology.\" [J]\u000a      \"Steve Duffield, accommodation manager at The Wilton Centre, said:\u000a          `The speed of Plaxica's progress is very impressive. It is an ideal\u000a          operation to have at the Centre, complementing other organisations\u000a          also here.'\" [K]\u000a    \u000a    Imperial Innovations, one of the major investors in Plaxica make the\u000a      following statement about the company: \"Plaxica is developing a new\u000a        generation of biopolymers derived from renewable resources. Plaxica's\u000a        polymers are a range of polylactic acid based materials which have\u000a        improved physical properties compared with first generation biopolymers.\u000a        In addition, they have a smaller environmental footprint, and are fully\u000a        recyclable and cost competitive with current oil-based alternatives.\u000a        First generation PLA is by far the most successful biopolymer to date,\u000a        with 25% of the biopolymer market. Plaxica's second generation PLA is\u000a        expected to combine the advantages of biopolymers with the mechanical\u000a        and thermal performance of petrochemical derived plastics and is\u000a        expected to develop a market much larger than that of existing\u000a        biopolymers. Given Plaxica's PLA's improved physical properties, its\u000a        applications will expand beyond the currently limited range of\u000a        applications for which first-generation PLAs can be used... Plaxica's\u000a        second generation PLA polymers are likely to compete effectively with\u000a        conventional oil-derived products such as PET, polypropylene and\u000a        polystyrene in applications ranging from textiles to automotive,\u000a        electronics, household goods and packaging. Plaxica's technology is\u000a        particularly suited to the use of sugars derived from cellulosic\u000a        feedstocks &#8212; which are normally waste products and do not, in general,\u000a        take food out of the supply chain\" [L]. They make the following\u000a      statement about the global polymers market: \"The global polymers market\u000a        is worth more than $400 billion in annual sales and has grown at an\u000a        average of 3.5% per year over the last two decades. The current\u000a        biopolymers market is in excess of $2 billion per annum and is growing\u000a        at more than 10% per year. PLA has 40% of this market, at some $800m,\u000a        and this is forecast to grow to $1bn by 2012\" [L].\u000a    The impact offered by Plaxica is nicely summed up by the CEO: \"Economically\u000a        Plaxica has grown quickly to employ a critical mass of scientist and\u000a        engineers... The emphasis on biopolymers from non-food sources such as\u000a        cellulose has clear societal and environmental impacts, and the focus on\u000a        using bioplastics in durable applications such as automotive interiors\u000a        demonstrates a sustainable advantage not offered by current PLA\u000a        materials\" [H].

Forging close industrial links in the\u000a      past, they developed a range of polymerisation catalysts including\u000a      examples for polyolefins, acrylics, styrenics and polyesters. Aspects of\u000a      this work have been performed in collaboration with a number of\u000a      multinational chemical companies including BP and BASF.\u000a    Gibson and Marshall started to examine polymers from renewable resources\u000a      in the late 1990s and between 2000 and 2006 produced a number of academic\u000a      publications and patents (e.g. [6]) in the field of stereoselective\u000a      catalysts for the production of poly(lactic acid), PLA. Even from an early\u000a      point in their research Gibson and Marshall realised the need to relate\u000a      their research to real world commercial-type operations, and therefore\u000a      published a number of reports exploring the use of well-defined molecular\u000a      analogues of the industry standard catalyst, stannous octanoate [1].\u000a      Further stand out publications include the first detailed theoretical\u000a      basis for stereoselectivity in lactide polymerisation catalysts (a\u000a      computational study carried out in collaboration with Prof, Henry Rzepa at\u000a      Imperial) [4], and a redox-active catalyst the activity of which can be\u000a      attenuated by the oxidation state of the pendant ligand (work carried out\u000a      with Prof. Nick Long at Imperial) [2]. PLA already had a significant\u000a      profile aided by a number of desirable quantities, including\u000a      biorenewability and biocompatibility and being compostable (according to\u000a      EU and ASTM guidelines). The construction of a 140ktpa plant in Nebraska\u000a      by a Cargill-Dow JV (NatureWorks) was seen as further evidence of the\u000a      promise of PLA.\u000a    The team successfully applied for public funds [G1-G3], but industrial\u000a      support for work on PLA was less straightforward to secure. In the early\u000a      2000's, it was thought that PLA suffered from a number of commercial\u000a      deficiencies e.g. its relatively low thermal stability (it deforms at ca.\u000a      50-55&#176;C), and hydrolytic instability. Its cost of manufacturing was also\u000a      higher than that of the plastics it was predicted to compete most closely\u000a      with e.g. PET, polyethylene terephathlate and PS, polystyrene.\u000a    Significantly, Gibson and Marshall's previous academic work had revealed\u000a      that the properties of PLA could be improved by using catalysts to promote\u000a      the formation of stereoregular PLA. With this advance, thermal stability,\u000a      for example, could be increased to &gt;100&#176;C, greatly increasing the\u000a      potential applications for PLA. Particular success was found with several\u000a      families of aluminium catalysts, some of which led to PLA with melting\u000a      points approaching 200&#176;C [3, 5].

Its remit was to help UK industry in\u000d\u000a      de- risking new micro- and nanotechnology enabled biomedical devices,\u000d\u000a      especially in the diagnostics sector.\u000d\u000a    In a series of papers, the Cass group at Imperial College demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that the use of protein design and engineering, often in combination with\u000d\u000a      nanostructured surfaces, could lead to novel sensor designs. The use of\u000d\u000a      engineered extensions (`tags') to enzymes was shown to enhance their\u000d\u000a      immobilisation on sensor surfaces. This work was in collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      Universities of Warwick, Southampton and Texas (Austin) [e.g. 1]. A\u000d\u000a      related collaboration with Prof E. Kobatake's group at the Tokyo Institute\u000d\u000a      of Technology, funded by JSPS and BBSRC, was also focussed along the same\u000d\u000a      lines [2]. Most of the research prior to this used very non-specific and\u000d\u000a      poorly controlled chemistry to attach enzymes to surfaces, often resulting\u000d\u000a      in significant and variable loss of function. Our work on engineered tags\u000d\u000a      showed how they could be used to develop a more rational approach. In\u000d\u000a      addition, the attachment of enzymes to nanostructured metal oxide surfaces\u000d\u000a      was being investigated, through collaboration with Prof James Durrant and\u000d\u000a      funded by the BBSRC [G2], and it was shown that a functional coupling\u000d\u000a      between the hard and soft materials could be achieved [3-5]. The unique\u000d\u000a      properties of the metal oxides meant that both optical and electrochemical\u000d\u000a      signal transduction schemes could be used, so yielding a flexible design\u000d\u000a      strategy. This resulted in the grant of a patent [6] with Cass, Durrant\u000d\u000a      and Gilardi as inventors. These papers and the patent established the\u000d\u000a      advantages of using engineered proteins with nanomaterials in producing\u000d\u000a      novel diagnostic devices, as well as demonstrating the expertise of the\u000d\u000a      Cass group in this area. It was this proven, internationally recognized\u000d\u000a      expertise that led directly to the establishment of BNC and the early\u000d\u000a      contracts that it won with diagnostics companies.\u000d\u000a    The personnel contributing to this research programme at Imperial were\u000d\u000a      Academic staff members Prof A.E. Cass (1983-present), Prof James Durrant\u000d\u000a      (1993-present), Prof Gianfranco Gilardi (Reader 1993-2011 then Visiting\u000d\u000a      Professor 2011-present), and research associate Catherine Halliwell\u000d\u000a      (1998-2002). The primary collaborators were the group of Prof E Kobatake\u000d\u000a      (Tokyo), Prof P.N. Bartlett (University of Southampton). In the\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Southampton, the contribution of the Cass group was to\u000d\u000a      carry out all the protein engineering work and to characterise the\u000d\u000a      engineered proteins in terms of their biochemical properties.\u000d\u000a      Incorporating these engineered proteins into electrically conducting\u000d\u000a      polymers and demonstrating the sensing aspects was done both at Imperial\u000d\u000a      and in Southampton. Collaborating with the Tokyo group, we had already\u000d\u000a      cloned, engineered and fluorescently labelled the glutamine binding\u000d\u000a      protein and this knowledge and materials (plasmids) were sent to Tokyo,\u000d\u000a      where the new tag was attached and the behaviour of the immobilised\u000d\u000a      protein characterised.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42246","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"1327865","Name":"Myanmar"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the Imperial College Chemistry Department led research on\u000a      solvent effects on east Asian lacquer has been significant and far\u000a      reaching.\u000a    Impact on the V&amp;A\u000a    It allowed accurate risk-benefit analysis that underpinned the use of\u000a      solvents for cleaning, removal of degraded Western varnish and\u000a      consolidation of the light-damaged surface of Mazarin Chest [A].\u000a      Treatments based on this research stabilised this object for an estimated\u000a      50-100 years and allowed it to travel to exhibitions in Japan and the USA\u000a      in 2008-9, with combined attendances of more than 200,000 (Kyoto National\u000a      Museum &gt;67,000; Suntory Museum of Art, Tokyo &gt;36,000; J.

This impact was reflected in the\u000a        conservation of objects held in public institutions &#8212; 89% of UK\u000a        institutional respondents involved in the treatment of lacquer objects\u000a        said all of their conservation treatments had been influenced by the\u000a        solvent effects research, the remaining 11% said up to 2\/3 of their\u000a        treatments had been influenced. 29% of international institutional\u000a        respondents reported that all of their treatments had been influenced\u000a        and 41% said that up to 1\/3 of their treatments had been influenced.\u000a    \u000a    Respondents were invited to comment on the solvent effects on lacquer\u000a      research. The following is a sample of the comments received:\u000a    (i) `The results were eye-opening. Extremely important research which\u000a        will change the way we approach degraded lacquer treatments' and `It\u000a        has done so much to influence our thinking about the treatment of\u000a        lacquer. It brought together the different approaches in a discussion\u000a        which we can all benefit from' (National Maritime Museum).\u000a    (ii) `This is very important and curators need to understand this\u000a        process and effect as well' (British Museum).\u000a    (iii) `Should be required reading'\u000a    Comments such as (i), (ii), and (iii) touch on the legacy impact of the\u000a      research. Although experienced specialist lacquer conservators may have\u000a      understood many of the findings already (reflected in the 25% who said\u000a      their practice had not changed very much), they had gained this knowledge\u000a      through (unpublished) trial and error tests. As many solvents cause\u000a      permanent damage to lacquer, the publication of the article [3] allows all\u000a      conservators, regardless of their relative experience, the opportunity to\u000a      make informed judgements without the necessity of damaging valuable\u000a      objects in the process of gaining empirical knowledge.\u000a    Respondents were also invited to comment on the Mazarin Chest project\u000a      more generally and the following is a sample of the comments received:\u000a    (i) `The project has been very influential in our lacquer research at\u000a        the Getty. The Crossing Borders symposium was exceptional in its breadth\u000a        and quality of presentations. The book is an excellent summary of the\u000a        symposium, standing as an important resource for those not fortunate\u000a        enough to attend, and is a ready reference for us in our work. I commend\u000a        all of you for having the courage to inquire about the impact that the\u000a        project has had on the field, because few institutions dare to take that\u000a        type of risk. In conclusion, I consider the Mazarin chest project to be\u000a        a smashing success that sets the bar for other collaborative projects\u000a        very high indeed. I applaud all who have been involved!' and `I\u000a        believe the Mazarin chest conservation project is one of the best and\u000a        most influential project in the lacquer conservation field' (Getty\u000a        Museum, USA)\u000a    (ii) `As noted previously, the project gave validity (in my eyes) to\u000a        the use of urushi-based treatments where appropriate (and with\u000a        appropriate training) &#8212; no other major museum has published urushi-based\u000a        treatments (or possibly undertaken them) so this was a significant\u000a        moment in the history of lacquer conservation in the West' (National\u000a      Gallery of Victoria, Australia).\u000a    (iii) `Japanese conservators have been using methods without thinking\u000a        very much.

It was carried out\u000a      within the Imperial Chemistry Department in 2001-2002 by Dr (now\u000a      Professor) T. Welton, Imperial PDRA P. A. Salter (EPSRC, 2000-2002) and\u000a      three Imperial College students, L. Crowhurst, P. Mawdsley (both EPSRC DTA\u000a      funded) and J. M. Perez-Arlandis (EPSRC DTA CASE studentship with Kodak)\u000a      within the Imperial Chemistry Department. This research produced the 2003\u000a      paper `Solvent-solute interactions in ionic liquids' by Crowhurst\u000a      et al. [1] which formed part of the citation for Prof Welton's 2007 RSC\u000a      Sir Christopher Ingold Lectureship.\u000a    The paper describes solvent-solute interactions in ionic liquids and\u000a      molecular solvents and how alternative methodologies give different\u000a      results, demonstrating the importance of the solute in determining the\u000a      observed solvent effects. This is an important consideration for\u000a      understanding how solvents interact with any given material's chemical\u000a      structure. This is a vital consideration when using solvents in\u000a      conservation treatments.\u000a    In 2004 this paper brought Prof Welton's research to the attention of\u000a      Shayne Rivers, a senior conservator in the conservation department of the\u000a      Victoria and Albert Museum, London, a UK non-departmental public body\u000a      funded by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the world's\u000a      largest museum of decorative arts and design. Ms Rivers was co-managing a\u000a      V&amp;A project to conserve the Mazarin Chest, the most important example\u000a      of Japanese export lacquer in the world, with an estimated value of &#163;10-15\u000a      million. This object, the centrepiece of the V&amp;A's Japanese\u000a      collection, had been removed from display in 1999 due to its damaged and\u000a      unstable condition. It had become clear that knowledge of the solvent\u000a      effects on Asian lacquer was insufficient to allow the Chest to be cleaned\u000a      without significant risk of permanent damage to, or loss of, the\u000a      decoration, where most of the aesthetic, historic and technical value of\u000a      this unique object is located. Ms Rivers contacted Prof Welton to ask him\u000a      to assist her.\u000a    As a result, in 2005 Prof Welton and Ms Rivers established an AHRB funded\u000a      Collaborative Doctoral Award entitled `Conserving Tangible and Intangible\u000a      Cultural Heritage: Removing Degraded Western Varnish from photo-degraded\u000a      Japanese Lacquer' [G1]. This was designed to guide Ms Rivers' conservation\u000a      practice by using quantitative scientific evidence of the effects of\u000a      solvents on these materials to identify whether, and if so which, solvent\u000a      treatments have the potential to remove degraded western varnish without\u000a      damaging underlying photo-degraded Japanese Lacquer. The research was\u000a      carried out from 2005-8 in the Imperial Chemistry Department with joint\u000a      supervision by Chemistry Department staff (Prof. T. Welton and Dr &#8212; now\u000a      Prof &#8212; M. Shaffer), V&amp;A curatorial (Dr R. Faulkner) and conservation\u000a      (S. Rivers) staff.\u000a    Key findings of this research were presented at an international\u000a      conference in 2009 [2] and published in English and Japanese in 2011 [3].\u000a      The Imperial research provided detailed information on the swelling and\u000a      leaching effects of a range of solvents used by conservators when cleaning\u000a      and stabilising Asian lacquer during conservation treatments. It\u000a      established, for the first time, which solvents could be used without\u000a      causing damage to Asian lacquer and the risks involved if less benign\u000a      solvents were required. It also emphasised that due to the kinetics of the\u000a      swelling process, the technique used by the conservator may be as\u000a      important as solvent choice, reinforcing the inextricable\u000a      inter-relationship between chemistry and individual conservation practice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42247","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The work carried out at Imperial between 1994 and 1999 was the basis of\u000d\u000a      the initial patent [3], applied for in 1995. This patent, which was\u000d\u000a      assigned to Nanoco from Imperial, was the first in the Nanoco IP portfolio\u000d\u000a      as described in Nanoco's 2009 admission document to AIM, the London Stock\u000d\u000a      Exchange's international market for smaller growing companies: `Nanoco's\u000a        earliest patent family dates back to 1995 and contains granted patents\u000d\u000a        in the US, Germany, France and the UK relating to the use of metal\u000d\u000a        complexes to produce nanocrystalline material known as the Single Source\u000d\u000a        Precursor technology. The Single Source Precursor technology was\u000d\u000a        developed by Professor Paul O'Brien while he was at Imperial College,\u000d\u000a        London and all IP was subsequently assigned to Nanoco' [A, p24].\u000d\u000a    This Imperial research provided the backbone for the spin-out of the\u000d\u000a      company which occurred in 2001 after Prof. O'Brien had moved to the\u000d\u000a      University of Manchester. Further patents did not follow until 2004 after\u000d\u000a      Nanoco had been running for 3 years, and as such, the initial patent can\u000d\u000a      be viewed as the cornerstone of Nanoco's commercialisation strategy and\u000d\u000a      the emergence of Nanoco in general.

In terms\u000d\u000a      of manufacturing, significant progress was made with procurement of a new\u000d\u000a      production facility in Runcorn, Cheshire as the company's first commercial\u000d\u000a      production plant and the addition of a series of scale-up reactors,\u000d\u000a      critical for the progression of quantum dots from very small scale\u000d\u000a      laboratory manufacture to mass production, in the Manchester headquarters.\u000d\u000a      Turnover for the year (to 7\/2010) was &#163;2.9 million [E].\u000d\u000a    In 2011 the Runcorn production facility was designed and built on\u000d\u000a      time and on budget. 1kg of red CFQDs were produced at Runcorn and shipped\u000d\u000a      to a Japanese LED customer triggering a $2 million payment [F].\u000d\u000a      Manufacturing quantum dots on this scale was a world-first technical\u000d\u000a      achievement and underlined the scalability of Nanoco's technology. A\u000d\u000a      follow-on product development agreement, worth $800,000, was signed with a\u000d\u000a      major Japanese company whose products include LCD TVs [F, G]. This\u000d\u000a      agreement, which followed an 18 month JDA, focused on the final steps in\u000d\u000a      combining CFQD into an LCD TV for commercial launch [F]. A JDA was signed\u000d\u000a      with one of the world's largest lighting companies in August 2011 for use\u000d\u000a      of QDs in general lighting [G].

These\u000d\u000a      payments follow similar payments achieved for the successful development\u000d\u000a      and delivery of red quantum dots in 2011. This Japanese corporation is now\u000d\u000a      working to incorporate the Company's CFQD directly onto LEDs for small\u000d\u000a      size LCD displays [H]. Following significant technical progress achieved\u000d\u000a      during the year a further thin film solar development agreement was signed\u000d\u000a      with Tokyo Electron. In October 2012, Nanoco signed a follow-on joint\u000d\u000a      development agreement with Osram, one of the world's largest lighting\u000d\u000a      companies [G]. Production scale-up plans were also on track in 2012 with\u000d\u000a      the production capacity design of an upgraded Runcorn lab increased to\u000d\u000a      400kg a year, reflecting a greater projected demand for quantum dots [I,\u000d\u000a      J]. Turnover for the year was &#163;2.95m and the company's cash, and cash\u000d\u000a      equivalents, at the financial year's end (7\/2012) were &#163;15.5 million [H].\u000d\u000a    In January 2013 Nanoco announced a worldwide licensing agreement\u000d\u000a      with the Dow Electronic Materials division of the Dow Chemical Company\u000d\u000a      [G]. Under the terms of the agreement, Dow will have exclusive worldwide\u000d\u000a      rights for the sale, marketing and manufacture of Nanoco's CFQDs for use\u000d\u000a      in electronic displays such as TVs, computer screens, tablets and\u000d\u000a      smartphones. Nanoco will receive royalty payments from Dow related to its\u000d\u000a      sales of CFQDs. Dow's experience of manufacturing scale-up was a key\u000d\u000a      component of the licensing agreement and it is expected that full\u000d\u000a      commercial production will begin in 2014 [G].

Prior\u000d\u000a      to this work, the only published and available precursor system for the\u000d\u000a      preparation of high quality semiconductor nanoparticles were metal alkyls,\u000d\u000a      silylated chalcogens and phosphorus-chalcogen compounds. This limited the\u000d\u000a      synthesis of quantum dots to expert organometallic chemistry laboratories,\u000d\u000a      and the yield of the reactions using these precursors was often extremely\u000d\u000a      low.\u000d\u000a    The use of simple cadmium dithiocarbamates (which could be prepared in\u000d\u000a      air under ambient conditions using commercially available starting\u000d\u000a      materials) lead to the routine synthesis of CdS nanoparticles, bypassing\u000d\u000a      the need for (CH3)2Cd and S(SiCH3)2,\u000d\u000a      both highly volatile and noxious compounds. Subsequently, the use of\u000d\u000a      single source precursors allowed for the scale-up of quantum dot\u000d\u000a      synthesis, with several grams of CdS being prepared in early 1996 by Mark\u000d\u000a      Green (PhD student, funded by an EPSRC CASE award, with British Telecom).\u000d\u000a      This was at the time, the largest yield of quantum dots prepared in the\u000d\u000a      world via a single organometallic reaction, opening the way for potential\u000d\u000a      commercialisation. Likewise, the preparation of gram scale amounts of\u000d\u000a      CdSe, the standard quantum dot material, was also achieved by the O'Brien\u000d\u000a      group using a range of cadmium diselenocarbamates during this period.\u000d\u000a    The initial work was protected by a key patent [3], `Process for\u000d\u000a        preparing a nanocrystalline material', which became the basis for\u000d\u000a      Nanoco. The patent, filed at Imperial College in 1995, was assigned to\u000d\u000a      Nanoco in 2005 and became the first in a series of patents which were\u000d\u000a      later filed through Nanoco.\u000d\u000a    The use of simple quantum dots in various applications is however limited\u000d\u000a      by their air sensitivity, and for use in for real-life applications, a\u000d\u000a      further inorganic shell is often required. The O'Brien group also reported\u000d\u000a      the first preparation of core\/shell particles using single source\u000d\u000a      precursors (published in 1999) [4].\u000d\u000a    The other key family of semiconducting materials are the III-Vs, such as\u000d\u000a      InP, and this was also prepared by single source precursors (published\u000d\u000a      1998) [5]. These materials are notable for not possessing cadmium, and in\u000d\u000a      the case of InP, have been highlighted as the next generation of\u000d\u000a      biological labels after the initial work on CdSe-based quantum dots raised\u000d\u000a      questions regarding toxicity. Likewise, the O'Brien group was the first\u000d\u000a      group to work on CuInS2 and CuInSe2 quantum dots\u000d\u000a      (published 1999), again prepared by single source precursors [6].

Of the\u000a      2.5 million tonnes of UK timber harvested annually, approximately\u000a      one-third is of suitable quality for transformation into\u000a      construction-grade sawn products. The remainder is used for paper,\u000a      chipboard, and biofuel, commanding a price about half that of timber for\u000a      construction [1]. The carbon in these other products is returned to the\u000a      atmosphere within 1-10 years, compared to 50-100 years for timber used to\u000a      build houses [2]. Consequently, there are both financial and environmental\u000a      reasons to channel the maximum possible percentage of UK timber into the\u000a      construction industry. To satisfy the UK Building Regulations, timber has\u000a      to meet the C16 quality specification. In practice the limiting C16\u000a      requirement for Sitka spruce, the prevalent conifer species in the UK, is\u000a      its stiffness: hence the relevance of the WestCHEM research.\u000a    Path to impact\u000a    From the outset of the SIRT Project in 2004, its research and KE goals\u000a      were planned together by a management board with majority industrial\u000a      representation. KE was implemented through industry workshops and the\u000a      Forestry Commission's simple but efficient system of Information Notes for\u000a      forest managers. Since 2004, four Glasgow PhDs have been co-funded by the\u000a      Forestry Commission and one part-time PhD student, a professional timber\u000a      buyer, is fully funded by Egger Forestry Ltd.\u000a    Nature of the Impact\u000a    Acoustic tools for measuring timber quality in the forest\u000a    Acoustic technology based on the WestCHEM research described above and\u000a      adapted for commercial use [Sources 3 and 4] was adopted in 2011 by James\u000a      Jones Ltd for measuring stiffness in standing trees [Source 5]. James\u000a      Jones Ltd is the second largest sawmilling company in the UK. Sawmillers\u000a      purchase standing timber, which is then felled, transported, and processed\u000a      prior to machine grading. Normally about 10% of sawn products fail to meet\u000a      the C16 grading standard and must be diverted to pulping or biomass fuel\u000a      [Source 3]. The costs (and embodied energy) of transporting, sawing, and\u000a      kiln-drying these outgrades are then wasted, amounting to about &#163;6M\/year\u000a      UK-wide [Sources 1and 6]. Selecting parcels of standing trees that will\u000a      give a low outgrade percentage is a crucial skill of timber buyers. James\u000a      Jones Ltd is now using acoustic measurements as a decision support tool\u000a      alongside the traditional, empirical skills of their buyers [Source 5]. In\u000a      these circumstances it is difficult to quantify the gain, but a realistic\u000a      estimate is a 1% reduction in outgrades, leading to a saving of about\u000a      &#163;0.4M since the adoption of the technology.\u000a    A further advance in profitability would be possible if individual logs\u000a      of high or low stiffness, rather than stands of trees, could be identified\u000a      at felling and consigned directly to the sawmill or elsewhere. Acoustic\u000a      devices attached to the harvesting machinery are under development by the\u000a      spin-out company Timber Sonics, started up in 2011 by Shaun Mochan, a\u000a      Forestry Commission researcher who was on sabbatical in WestCHEM in 2007.\u000a    Genetically improved Sitka spruce\u000a    Before the study of P. McLean under Jarvis's supervision, it was assumed\u000a      that the stiffness of Sitka spruce wood was controlled mainly by density,\u000a      and that fast growing tree genotypes would produce low-density timber of\u000a      poor stiffness that would not meet the C16 specification for construction\u000a      purposes. The WestCHEM research showed that, although low density is\u000a      indeed connected with fast growth, stiffness need not be. Cellulose\u000a      orientation is much more important than density in determining the\u000a      stiffness of the wood [Source 7]. It is, therefore, possible to combine\u000a      fast growth, straight stems (giving improved out-turn at the sawmill), and\u000a      stiff timber (due to good cellulose orientation). These findings were\u000a      disseminated informally to the forest industry in 2006-2007 [Source 8] and\u000a      a Forestry Commission Information Note followed in 2008 [Source 9]. The\u000a      private forestry sector has enthusiastically adopted improved planting\u000a      stock and the large forestry company UPM Tilhill is planting improved\u000a      material almost exclusively. Across both public and private sectors,\u000a      improved stock now accounts for over 80% of new planting [Source 10] and\u000a      around 50M improved trees have been planted since 2008. The change has\u000a      been driven by the predicted increase in total wood volume as well as\u000a      increased sawlog output, but it would have been inhibited if the\u000a      perception that improved trees would fail to produce construction-grade\u000a      timber had persisted [Source 10].\u000a    The economic benefits are difficult to estimate when trees take typically\u000a      40 years to mature and when there are uncertainties concerning the\u000a      influence of the biomass energy market and the restructuring of UK\u000a      forests.

The\u000a      aims of the SIRT Project are to understand wood structure and its\u000a      relationship with timber performance, and to promote the use of UK-grown\u000a      Sitka spruce in the construction industry. SIRT spans from molecules to\u000a      trees and from the forest to the building site. WestCHEM's contribution\u000a      stems from previous BBSRC-funded research on cellulose structure\u000a      (2000-2003) including novel spectroscopic and scattering methods to probe\u000a      disorder and mechanical function.\u000a    Key Research Findings\u000a    Wood is a composite material based on cellulose fibres (microfibrils)\u000a      embedded in a matrix of other carbohydrate polymers and lignin. WestCHEM\u000a      research led to the determination of the structure of the cellulose\u000a      microfibrils [1-3] and their interconnection through disordered interfaces\u000a      with other wood polymers [3,4]. Under tension, wood can stretch by two\u000a      mechanisms. One is by elastic stretching of the cellulose fibres\u000a      themselves, when they are well aligned with the grain in the stiffest and\u000a      strongest wood. The other is a time-dependent, slip-stick mechanism termed\u000a      `molecular Velcro' [4]. Using the metaphor of microfibrils as two pieces\u000a      of Velcro and of hydrogen-bonded, non-cellulosic polymers as the hooks and\u000a      loops between them, tensile force detaches the connections from the\u000a      disordered microfibril surfaces [3], allowing the microfibrils to slide\u000a      until the `Velcro' re-attaches and restores the original strength of the\u000a      structure [4].\u000a    The progressive transition between these two stretching mechanisms\u000a      explains the steep and near-linear dependence of wood stiffness on\u000a      cellulose orientation [5], a key element in the impact of the research on\u000a      the genetic improvement of trees. Previously it had been thought that\u000a      stiffness was controlled more by density, which decreases in fast growing\u000a      trees. In 2004-2007 WestCHEM researchers collected a large body of x-ray\u000a      data on microfibril orientation in Sitka spruce trees of varying genotype\u000a      and showed that fast growing trees do not necessarily suffer the penalty\u000a      in stiffness that had previously been assumed [6].\u000a    The other key development was the introduction of acoustic methods for\u000a      measuring wood stiffness in standing trees. In principle, the stiffness of\u000a      the wood is proportional to the square of the speed of a sound wave\u000a      travelling between two probes attached at different heights on the side of\u000a      the tree. However, the acoustic frequency is so high that part of the\u000a      `molecular Velcro' component is too slow to be captured. The standing-tree\u000a      acoustic stiffness therefore differs from the bending stiffness measured\u000a      by the standard machines used to grade commercial timber. In addition, the\u000a      dominant path of the sound wave is just under the bark, where the\u000a      cellulose is better oriented, and the wood is therefore stiffer than in\u000a      the rest of the tree. Both problems led to scepticism about acoustic\u000a      methods when these were first introduced. However, understanding how wood\u000a      stretches encouraged the WestCHEM group to persist and find practical\u000a      solutions. The ratio of acoustic to bending stiffness was quantified by\u000a      laboratory-scale calibration on well-characterised material, and detailed\u000a      measurements and modelling of the radial variation of microfibril\u000a      orientation, density, and stiffness allowed the properties of timber sawn\u000a      from any point within a tree to be predicted from measurements at its\u000a      surface [6]. The WestCHEM researchers who carried out these experiments\u000a      were members of the SIRT field teams that did the first successful\u000a      standing-tree acoustic surveys in the UK [6].\u000a    Key Researchers\u000a    Dr Michael Jarvis (appointed 1979, now Reader) led a group that included\u000a      Clemens Altaner (SIRT RF 2004-07); Shaun Mochan (visiting researcher on\u000a      sabbatical from the Forestry Commission, 2007) and 5 PhD students funded\u000a      or co-funded by the forestry industry (2004-2013).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42296","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In 2011, the U.S. Drug Discovery company, Serometrix, was attracted by\u000a      the University's championing of our computer technology for the\u000a      accelerated discovery of allosterically acting drugs. The company operates\u000a      internationally between other university research teams and the very large\u000a      pharmaceutical companies to identify promising drug leads. At the time,\u000a      the company was focused on developing drugs for the lowering of\u000a      cholesterol levels and had been working on one particular protein target.\u000a      This target was proving intractable to the usual drug discovery process\u000a      and Serometrix had already concluded that some kind of \"shapeshifting\"\u000a      (i.e. allosterically acting) drug was required.\u000a    When we were invited to analyse the target, the company already had its\u000a      own confidential direct experimental data about the location of sites\u000a      where small molecules could bind and produce \"shapeshifting\" (i.e. they\u000a      challenged us with a \"blind trial\"). On receiving our theoretical\u000a      predictions as to suitable site locations (calculated by our technology in\u000a      seconds) and comparing them with their own findings (achieved after\u000a      significant expenditure of their time and money on conventional\u000a      investigation), the company immediately opened negotiations with the\u000a      university to develop a research contract, exclusively license our\u000a      technology and obtain more calculations on other targets (our technology\u000a      is applicable to all 86,000 structures in the Protein Data Bank). The CEO\u000a      of the company said at the time of the initial trial work (Source 1):\u000a    \"What I find extremely exciting about this entire process is that if\u000a        you look at the time required to identify the spot to begin working,\u000a        through to our current understanding as of today &#8212; it is mind boggling!\u000a        If you compare what we have jointly accomplished with these tools, as\u000a        compared to any other drug discovery platform known to man at this time,\u000a        we may have just improved the efficiency of this process by several\u000a        orders of magnitude. It is clear to me that your program is providing\u000a        accurate predictions about regions where these sites might exist.\"\u000a    Since then, the company has concluded our technology is \"best in class\"\u000a      (Source 3) and has:\u000a    \u000a      Contracted with the University of Strathclyde for exclusive access to\u000a        the technology (Sources 3, 6 and 7). The contract and license includes a\u000a        multi-million buyout option and requires the university to provide the\u000a        company with secure on-line access to the technology for 20 years.\u000a      Used its exclusive access to the new technology to help secure U.S.\u000a        venture capital funding of $228k in June 2012 (Source 4) and pursued\u000a        discussions leading to further venture capital funding, final agreement\u000a        for which is expected to be concluded shortly (Source 2).\u000a      Hired a new Business Development Manager and Medicinal Chemist to take\u000a        full advantage of our technology as quickly as possible (two further\u000a        appointments are due in late 2013).\u000a      Applied the technology to accelerate progress on its current portfolio\u000a        of drug targets with the intention of eventually applying it to all\u000a        proteins of interest as drug targets (including revisiting those that\u000a        have been previously investigated by the pharmaceutical industry).\u000a      \"Shaved years off\" the first stage of its core discovery process and\u000a        reduced its planned number of early trial compounds \"from millions to\u000a        hundreds\" (Source 3).\u000a      Discovered new active lead compounds via the first site predictions\u000a        provided by the university in 2011.

Their intention is to develop drug\u000a      leads that can be licensed forward to the larger companies and then pursue\u000a      new targets\/leads. As this collaboration matures, the reach will extend\u000a      beyond the company to larger concerns and eventually to those who will\u000a      benefit from the drugs.\u000a    Our tool for the discovery of drugs that \"shapeshift\" their molecular\u000a        targets is showing how to up-regulate and down-regulate\u000a      protein\/enzyme action without abolishing it, and this is a\u000a      paradigm shift from classic drug action. The newer drugs can also be much\u000a        more selective amongst a family of related targets because they are\u000a      not restricted to highly conserved sites, leading to lower dosing\u000a      requirements and fewer toxic side-effects. This innovative industrial\u000a      collaboration and on-line service comes at a time when much of the drug\u000a      discovery industry is embroiled in a continuing saga of expensive failure\u000a      and temptation to fraud through its adherence to conventional wisdom in\u000a      terms of drug action.\u000a    By helping to automate the process, bringing costs down and prompting\u000a      production of less risky drugs, our technology breaks the current log-jam\u000a      in the drug discovery market and makes it more likely that small market\u000a      drugs (i.e. for small groups of sufferers or developing world populations)\u000a      will become viable.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A computer technology has been invented to accelerate drug discovery.

Our aim was to learn more about protein evolution and\u000a      how shape and function might be predictable through analysis of the\u000a      growing databases of sequence and 3D structure. We investigated a range of\u000a      contrasting theoretical approaches to the data analysis as reported in\u000a      references 1-4. The outcomes eventually led us to focus on the information\u000a      content of just the three-dimensional path adopted by the molecular\u000a      backbone in the folded protein. These fold shapes encode the fundamental\u000a      characteristics relevant to maintaining functional capability, molecular\u000a      responsiveness and adaptability through the evolutionary process. From the\u000a      very large range of possible chain fold shapes, only relatively few have\u000a      persisted in living organisms, apparently only those fit and \"smart\"\u000a      enough for purpose.\u000a    The originality of this investigation lay in its focus purely upon the\u000a      enduring characteristics of the chain folding shapes rather than on the\u000a      atomic detail of the amino acid residue chemistries along their length.\u000a    Key findings\u000a    Our results from this research strategy in the late 1990s\/early 2000s\u000a      indicated that a computer technology for predicting important interactive\u000a      sites in proteins from the chain-fold motif alone was possible.\u000a      The first attempt at a systematic algorithm for site location in enzymes\u000a      based on the new principle was published in 2003 (Reference 5).\u000a      Subsequently, after the prototype program was modified, refined and\u000a      extended in its analytical procedure, given a versatile graphical user\u000a      interface and made able to process large numbers of protein structures\u000a      (achieved through collaboration with Dr John Wilson in the Department of\u000a      Computer and Information Science at Strathclyde), it was realised that the\u000a      output from the program was also succeeding in predicting additional sites\u000a      where small molecule binding was known to induce changes in protein shape\u000a      that regulated activity. As no reliable method existed for predicting\u000a      sites for shape-altering drugs (also describable as \"shapeshifting\",\u000a      topomorphic or allosteric drugs), it was realised that our technology,\u000a      would have considerable commercial value as an aid to industrial drug\u000a      discovery, and also be a game-changer in terms of the discovery logic and\u000a      the quality of the end product.\u000a    The majority of small molecule drugs on the market are competitive\u000a      of a protein's key functional site and basically stop the protein working\u000a      altogether. However, shape-shifting drugs can bind away from the key site\u000a      (i.e. they are termed non-competitive or uncompetitive) and exert more\u000a      subtle influences on the bioactivity, bringing about only small,\u000a      non-critical, changes to the shape of the key site. Subtle adjustment of\u000a      such sites is the way natural evolution adjusts protein activity via\u000a      side-chain mutations remote from active sites, while natural allosteric\u000a      effectors exert remote control of the sites during the lifetime of the\u000a      protein. Put simply, it is like the difference between an on\/off switch\u000a      and a dimmer switch in lighting control.\u000a    This computer technology was one of the very first to offer a readily\u000a      accessible solution to the problem of systematically detecting\u000a      shapeshifting sites in proteins. The desirability of moving towards drugs\u000a      that have an allosteric\/topomorphic action has only come to the fore in\u000a      the last few years as successful examples of such drugs have been brought\u000a      to market. Thus our technology was brought to fruition at a key point in\u000a      the changing strategic direction of the drug discovery industry. After a\u000a      long period of testing, refinement and preparation for high throughput\u000a      industrial use, the technology was publicised (Reference 6) and championed\u000a      with support from the University's Research and Knowledge Exchange\u000a      Services.\u000a    Key researchers\u000a    Lead researcher: Dr Mark Dufton, Senior Lecturer, WestCHEM (appointed\u000a      1984, Senior Lecturer from 1994 &#8212; present).\u000a    Collaborating researcher: Dr John Wilson, Senior Lecturer, Department of\u000a      Computer and Information Science, University of Strathclyde (appointed\u000a      1985, Senior Lecturer from 2002 &#8212; present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42297","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    From research to impact\u000d\u000a    XstalBio Ltd was formed as a spin-out company in 2004 to license,\u000d\u000a      commercialise, and extend the\u000d\u000a      intellectual property associated with the protein and vaccine\u000d\u000a      stabilisation technology.

The in vivo activity of biomolecules such as enzymes,\u000d\u000a      monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines\u000d\u000a      is determined by the tertiary structure, i.e., the\u000d\u000a      three-dimensional conformation. This means that\u000d\u000a      biologic drugs are much less stable and therefore harder to formulate and\u000d\u000a      administer than\u000d\u000a      traditional small molecule drugs.\u000d\u000a    Research by the research groups of BD Moore (Senior Lecturer and Reader,\u000d\u000a      WestCHEM), PJ\u000d\u000a      Halling (Professor, WestCHEM) and MC Parker (Lecturer, WestCHEM) aimed to\u000d\u000a      facilitate the\u000d\u000a      transfer of active enzymes from aqueous to organic media to harness their\u000d\u000a      catalytic power in\u000d\u000a      organic synthesis. A key observation was that dehydration processes other\u000d\u000a      than lyophilisation\u000d\u000a      resulted in much better retention of enzyme catalytic activity and\u000d\u000a      excellent preservation of protein\u000d\u000a      tertiary structure in the dry state (1). The wider importance of this\u000d\u000a      finding was recognised and the\u000d\u000a      innovative stabilisation technology was translated into commercial\u000d\u000a      formulation of therapeutic\u000d\u000a      biomolecules and vaccines.\u000d\u000a    Key Findings\u000d\u000a      The pathway of transferring an enzyme from aqueous solution into\u000d\u000a      non-aqueous media is found to\u000d\u000a      be critical in maintaining catalytic activity and surprisingly,\u000d\u000a      conventional protein drying methods\u000d\u000a      such as lyophilisation give very poor results. Moore and Parker discovered\u000d\u000a      and patented (\"Rapid\u000d\u000a      Dehydration of Proteins\", WO0069887) a much more successful\u000d\u000a      process based on co-precipitation\u000d\u000a      of enzymes with an inorganic salt by addition of an aqueous mixture to an\u000d\u000a      excess of water-miscible\u000d\u000a      solvent (2). This method was designed to rapidly dehydrate the enzyme, as\u000d\u000a      the water dissolved\u000d\u000a      into the solvent, but the additional bonus was that it also resulted in\u000d\u000a      spontaneous formation of\u000d\u000a      microcrystals of the salt coated with protein. Self-assembly of these\u000d\u000a      protein-coated microcrystals\u000d\u000a      (PCMCs) was found to be applicable to all enzyme classes tested and the\u000d\u000a      process coupled with\u000d\u000a      control of protonation state (3) are recognised as benchmark methods for\u000d\u000a      preparing biocatalysts for\u000d\u000a      use in non-aqueous media. The high catalytic activity of enzymes on dry\u000d\u000a      PCMC particles was\u000d\u000a      postulated to be because an unusually high proportion of protein molecules\u000d\u000a      retained a native\u000d\u000a      tertiary conformation in the dry state. This was subsequently proven to be\u000d\u000a      the case by solid-state\u000d\u000a      circular dichroism spectroscopy and active site-titrations in dry solvent.\u000d\u000a    The excellent retention of protein native structure in PCMCs was\u000d\u000a      recognised to have applications\u000d\u000a      beyond biocatalysis and applied research at WestCHEM explored their\u000d\u000a      potential use as a platform\u000d\u000a      for delivery of therapeutic biomolecules by inhalation (4). This research\u000d\u000a      identified a novel method\u000d\u000a      for forming free-flowing dry powders by supercritical fluid carbon dioxide\u000d\u000a      extraction of suspensions\u000d\u000a      of PCMC in solvent. The formulations and process were patented\u000d\u000a      (\"Pharmaceutical Composition\",\u000d\u000a      WO2004062560) in conjunction with an alternate continuous flow\u000d\u000a      process for precipitating PCMC\u000d\u000a      particles (\"Process for Preparing Microcrystals\",\u000d\u000a\u0009  WO2006010921). A range of physiologically\u000d\u000a      acceptable water-soluble crystals, including amino-acids and sugars, were\u000d\u000a      investigated with the\u000d\u000a      aim of preparing PCMC particles in the size-range 3-5 &#181;m suitable for\u000d\u000a      delivery to the lung. Dry\u000d\u000a      powders of model proteins with promising aerodynamic properties were\u000d\u000a      identified and found to be\u000d\u000a      unusually stable to high temperature and humidity meaning they could be\u000d\u000a      stored without requiring\u000d\u000a      refrigeration or an inert atmosphere. These properties are highly\u000d\u000a      desirable for formulation and\u000d\u000a      delivery of biologic drugs and vaccines (5).\u000d\u000a    The spin-out of XstalBio in 2004 provided access to much more\u000d\u000a      aggregation-sensitive proteins\u000d\u000a      such as humanised monoclonal antibodies supplied by commercial partners,\u000d\u000a      and stimulated further\u000d\u000a      improvements to the technology. In research directed by Moore,\u000d\u000a      zwitterionic additives were\u000d\u000a      identified which disrupted aggregation of precipitated protein on exposure\u000d\u000a      to polar solvents and\u000d\u000a      enabled them to be incorporated onto the outer surface of the particles in\u000d\u000a      a native quaternary state\u000d\u000a      (6). These additives were patented (\"Precipitation Stabilising\u000d\u000a      Compositions\", WO2008132439) and\u000d\u000a      the technology has been successfully applied to the formulation of over\u000d\u000a      ten therapeutic monoclonal\u000d\u000a      antibodies in development by pharmaceutical companies.\u000d\u000a    It was also shown that a double decomposition process could be carried\u000d\u000a      out in a polar organic\u000d\u000a      solvent between (i) phosphate salts that have been co-immobilised with\u000d\u000a      biomolecules on the\u000d\u000a      crystal surface and (ii) calcium chloride dissolved in the solvent. The\u000d\u000a      resultant outer shell of\u000d\u000a      sparingly aqueous-soluble calcium phosphate can be used to tune the rate\u000d\u000a      at which biomolecules\u000d\u000a      are released back into aqueous solution. Patented in 2008 (\"Slow Release\u000d\u000a      Compositions\",\u000d\u000a      WO2009077732) these findings have led to the development of vaccines in\u000d\u000a      which both antigens\u000d\u000a      and toll-like receptor agonists are co-immobilised on slow-release\u000d\u000a      particles, resulting in enhanced\u000d\u000a      innate and adaptive immune responses.

The impact is most easily broken down into three main areas.\u000d\u000a    1. New capability for law enforcement agencies by provision of new\u000d\u000a          tools to identify specific manufacturing routes of illicit drugs and\u000d\u000a          link this back to criminal intelligence data\u000d\u000a    Illicit drug production is a major issue affecting every country in the\u000d\u000a      world with clandestine manufacturing methods and locations constantly\u000d\u000a      changing and developing in their sophistication. The production of\u000d\u000a      precursors for illicit drugs takes place mainly in South East Asia and\u000d\u000a      specifically Malaysia. In 2011, over 1000 kg of methylamphetamine and\u000d\u000a      364,000 ecstasy tablets were seized by the Royal Malaysian Police with a\u000d\u000a      combined estimated street value in excess of $105M. This indicates the\u000d\u000a      scale of the problem for one specific country.\u000d\u000a    The engagement process for this research was as follows: The research\u000d\u000a      published by WestCHEM on the chemical characterisation and classification\u000d\u000a      of ecstasy tablets prompted the Royal Malaysian Police to fund two PhD\u000d\u000a      research students to study at WestCHEM over a five-year period. This\u000d\u000a      provided sustained training in core research methods within this area and\u000d\u000a      the development of a research legacy to advance this field through\u000d\u000a      transfer back to Malaysia. During this time, profiling of\u000d\u000a      methylamphetamine prepared by 8 synthetic routes was developed using GCMS,\u000d\u000a      IRMS, and ICPMS with multivariate data interpretation.\u000d\u000a    The new analytical methodologies, databases, and data analysis approaches\u000d\u000a      developed at WestCHEM have now been implemented in Malaysia on a daily\u000d\u000a      operational basis by the Royal Malaysian Police. The implementation of the\u000d\u000a      research findings has allowed identification of precursor chemicals and\u000d\u000a      the synthetic route used in the production of methylamphetamine. This has\u000d\u000a      provided the Royal Malaysian Police with a new capability leading to\u000d\u000a      enhanced sophistication of investigations, the development of new police\u000d\u000a      intelligence, and the increased ability to secure convictions.\u000d\u000a    The majority of the impact from this research has taken place to date\u000d\u000a      within Malaysia, however, there is also collaborations with the United\u000d\u000a      States Drug Enforcement Agency (USDEA) in the area.\u000d\u000a    Further external engagement followed successful publications in the area\u000d\u000a      of illicit drug synthesis and the Thai Government funded a postdoctoral\u000d\u000a      researcher to be based at WestCHEM to investigate the development of a\u000d\u000a      rapid semi-quantitative presumptive test to allow the determination of the\u000d\u000a      concentration of an illicit drug present within street-seized samples. The\u000d\u000a      test is based on simple colorimetric analysis subsequently recorded using\u000d\u000a      a smartphone with GPS to relay information relative to the point of\u000d\u000a      seizure of the materials.

Rapid identification of legal highs for use in criminal\u000d\u000a          prosecutions\u000d\u000a    The emergence of legal highs as an area of significant concern has led to\u000d\u000a      the increased awareness of the need for rapid and accurate identification\u000d\u000a      of such compounds. One of the stumbling blocks to addressing rapidly\u000d\u000a      changing legislations in this area has been the lack of `gold standards'\u000d\u000a      for each the legal high compound, which are required to facilitate robust\u000d\u000a      and accurate verification and validation of analytical methodologies\u000d\u000a      suitable for use in criminal court cases. The research process involved\u000d\u000a      collaboration between WestCHEM and the Scottish Police Authority Forensic\u000d\u000a      Sciences (SPAFS) to address this crucial issue by synthesising and\u000d\u000a      characterising legal high standards which were subsequently used in\u000d\u000a      verification of analytical methodologies for compound identification in an\u000d\u000a      operational context. The impact of these analytical methodologies as a\u000d\u000a      general cathinone screen in forensic casework in Scotland has involved the\u000d\u000a      analysis of 900 samples associated with criminal and morbid toxicology\u000d\u000a      cases, resulting in the detection of legal high drugs in 21 of those\u000d\u000a      samples, covering 11 different `New Psychoactive Substances' (NPS).\u000d\u000a    In recognition of the impact of this research, this new approach was\u000d\u000a      nominated for a Scottish Police Authority award. One judge commented:\u000d\u000a    `[This is ..]..a good example of a project based on analysis of\u000d\u000a        existing local data in a way which promotes a new look at a national\u000d\u000a        priority area. As well as creating opportunities for closer partnership,\u000d\u000a        working with health and voluntary agencies it has identified means of a\u000d\u000a        more focused service provision in relation to drug misuse.'\u000d\u000a    A second judge added:\u000d\u000a    `This project will be a valuable support to the new single [police]\u000d\u000a        service.'\u000d\u000a    3. New UN protocol for identification of seized materials\u000d\u000a    As a result of the WestCHEM research profile in the area of legal high\u000d\u000a      drug identification, Professor Nic Daeid was invited to develop a new\u000d\u000a      protocol for legal high characterisation for the United Nations Office of\u000d\u000a      Drugs and Crime (UNODC). This activity further extended an on-going\u000d\u000a      relationship and consultancy between Professor Nic Daeid and the UNIODC.\u000d\u000a      The UNODC manuals are developed by `scientific experts recognised for\u000d\u000a        their exceptional contribution to knowledge and\/or the promotion of best\u000d\u000a        practice in the area of interest' and are used by forensic science\u000d\u000a      laboratories across the globe as the accepted industry standard.

It involves a series of autonomous chemical\u000d\u000a      production phases, each servicing the supply of the next and is overarched\u000d\u000a      by connection to complex organised crime networks. The normal phases of\u000d\u000a      illicit drug production include: chemical synthesis of pre-precursor\u000d\u000a      materials followed by synthesis of the desired compound through a variety\u000d\u000a      of routes; sample dilution with `cutting' agents; and finally introduction\u000d\u000a      of the illicit drug samples into the dealer\/user distribution networks.\u000d\u000a      Due to the differences in chemical synthesis deployed, `families' of\u000d\u000a      impurities and side products become associated with these illicit drugs\u000d\u000a      and can be used to profile and map which synthetic route has been used.\u000d\u000a      Additionally, and in some circumstances, the chemical synthesis route\u000d\u000a      categorisation can be tentatively aligned to a geographical area. An\u000d\u000a      extension of characterising illicit drug production is the ability to\u000d\u000a      rapidly identify and quantify the controlled materials at point of\u000d\u000a      seizure. This pervasive problem can be a barrier to successful litigation\u000d\u000a      and investigative work particularly in, but not limited to, developing\u000d\u000a      countries where access to rapid response forensic science services can be\u000d\u000a      restricted.\u000d\u000a    Recent attempts to circumvent the criminality relating to illicit drugs\u000d\u000a      have seen the rapidly growing emergence of so called `legal high'\u000d\u000a      compounds. Many of these compounds circumvent the existing drug\u000d\u000a      legislation and pose a significant risk to the general population. Methods\u000d\u000a      to identify accurately the presence of such materials are vital to allow\u000d\u000a      the development of the legal framework surrounding these contentious\u000d\u000a      compounds. One of the major challenges to the legal environment is that\u000d\u000a      the compounds emerge into society so rapidly and thus to identify them\u000d\u000a      accurately is very difficult. To overcome this, the legal highs in\u000d\u000a      question need to be synthesised in a pure and accurate form to allow\u000d\u000a      standardised analytical methodologies to be verified and validated for use\u000d\u000a      within law enforcement.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers\u000d\u000a    WestCHEM academics have been involved in the preparation,\u000d\u000a      characterisation, and continued development of analytical methods for the\u000d\u000a      investigation of synthetic controlled drugs since 2006. Professor Niamh\u000d\u000a      NicDaeid (appointed June 1994, Senior Lecturer from April 2001, Reader\u000d\u000a      from April 2009 and Professor from September 2011) is one of the leading\u000d\u000a      authors in the world in this area and has led the research since 2006.\u000d\u000a      Prof William Kerr (appointed as Lecturer, WestCHEM, October 1989, Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer from April 1997 and Professor of Organic Chemistry from April\u000d\u000a      2002), has been involved in supporting the synthetic phase of the work\u000d\u000a      (2006-2011) and Dr Oliver Sutcliff (Lecturer WestCHEM from September\u000d\u000a      2007-January 2012, and holding non-salaried Visiting Scholar appointment\u000d\u000a      since then) has been directly involved in the legal high research\u000d\u000a      (2010-2012).\u000d\u000a    Key Research Findings\u000d\u000a    The identification and characterisation of synthetic routes for\u000d\u000a          illicit drug production\u000d\u000a      The disruption of the clandestine manufacture of illicit materials,\u000d\u000a      primarily the manufacture of amphetamine type stimulants, such as\u000d\u000a      3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (ecstasy) and methylamphetamine, is\u000d\u000a      vital in attempting to control and restrict these illicit materials. The\u000d\u000a      large-scale production, distribution and sale of such drugs is estimated\u000d\u000a      to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars per annum and affects\u000d\u000a      over 315 million people worldwide. To address this, a body of research\u000d\u000a      undertaken at WestCHEM from 2006 onwards developed chemical analytical\u000d\u000a      methods for synthetic illicit drugs for use by global law enforcement\u000d\u000a      agencies. More specifically, the research focused on the preparation of\u000d\u000a      ecstasy and methylamphetamine under precisely controlled synthetic\u000d\u000a      conditions. This facilitated the understanding of the chemical signature\u000d\u000a      data derived from three complementary instrumental techniques, GCMS, IRMS,\u000d\u000a      and ICPMS for these compounds (1,2,3,6). The understanding of the derived\u000d\u000a      data has been reinforced by multivariate chemometric techniques that\u000d\u000a      included the novel application of artificial neural networks (1). The\u000d\u000a      outcome from the research was a framework for the development of a\u000d\u000a      structured and focused approach that allowed specific samples to be\u000d\u000a      classified according to their synthetic methodology of production.\u000d\u000a    In parallel, point of seizure identification and quantification of\u000d\u000a      illicit drugs was also researched. This resulted in a very simple field\u000d\u000a      test using a semi-quantitative approach (5), which is currently being\u000d\u000a      linked to a smartphone using GPS positioning of the point of\u000d\u000a      interrogation. This research has focused on both opiate drugs as well as\u000d\u000a      amphetamine-type stimulants given their global prevalence.\u000d\u000a    The identification of legal highs\u000d\u000a      Legal highs are predominantly cathinone based synthetic compounds designed\u000d\u000a      to give a similar physiological effect to an illicit drug, but without the\u000d\u000a      criminal implications. Many compounds have not been fully tested in terms\u000d\u000a      of their short- and long-term health implications and the ability of\u000d\u000a      healthcare and law enforcement agencies to deal with this problem is\u000d\u000a      significantly compromised by their inability, in some cases, to identify\u000d\u000a      the legally controlled component. In order to address this, a body of\u000d\u000a      research to synthesise specific legal high compounds with very high purity\u000d\u000a      was undertaken coupled with the investigation and characterisation of\u000d\u000a      these materials using analytical methodologies (4). Without these `gold\u000d\u000a      standard' legal high calibration samples, the analytical methodologies\u000d\u000a      could not have been developed.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42300","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    From research to impact\u000d\u000a      EPSRC and industrially funded research at WestCHEM, including an EPSRC\u000d\u000a      CASE studentship\u000d\u000a      (2002-2005) with Carron Phoenix Ltd, resulted in the development of novel\u000d\u000a      polymer\u000d\u000a      nanocomposite formulations with mechanical, thermal, and barrier\u000d\u000a      properties superior to the base\u000d\u000a      polymers.

Efforts\u000d\u000a      to improve the efficiency are important; efficiency gains of 10% in the\u000d\u000a      study of the pharma-cokinetics\u000d\u000a      of candidate drugs would bring savings of the order of $100M per drug.\u000d\u000a      (Source 6).\u000d\u000a    The pharmaceutical industry is now applying the new technology directly\u000d\u000a      to its pipeline of\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical candidates, with AstraZeneca in the lead, but with uptake\u000d\u000a      gathering pace globally.\u000d\u000a      At present, the principal impact is on operational efficiencies and cost\u000d\u000a      reductions for the\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical companies, but the impact passes to the population at large\u000d\u000a      through the provision\u000d\u000a      of safer, more effective medicines at lower cost and with less\u000d\u000a      environmental impact.\u000d\u000a    The Global Head of Isotope Chemistry, AstraZeneca (Source 1) notes:\u000d\u000a    `The Kerr catalysts are now `state of the art' in this area of\u000d\u000a        labelling.

These labelled\u000d\u000a      compounds are most\u000d\u000a      conveniently made by taking the unlabelled drug candidate and introducing\u000d\u000a      the label in a single\u000d\u000a      step by hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) through C-H activation on an\u000d\u000a      aromatic ring ortho- to a\u000d\u000a      substituent that can interact with a suitable catalyst.

Kerr (Professor,\u000d\u000a      WestCHEM) predicted and then demonstrated that these complexes show\u000d\u000a      exceptional activity in\u000d\u000a      hydrogen isotope exchange processes. Previous efforts by other research\u000d\u000a      teams to prepare similar\u000d\u000a      compounds had failed, but through two PhD projects at WestCHEM, Kerr\u000d\u000a      discovered an approach\u000d\u000a      that was successful and convenient. The research for the initial\u000d\u000a      publication was carried out with\u000d\u000a      deuterium (non-radioactive isotope of hydrogen) but with clear\u000d\u000a      applicability to tritium (radioactive\u000d\u000a      isotope of hydrogen) and with the stated aim of addressing important\u000d\u000a      studies of metabolism of drug\u000d\u000a      candidates within the pharmaceutical industry.\u000d\u000a    The interaction with AstraZeneca (at M&#246;lndal in Sweden) triggered through\u000d\u000a      the funding of the\u000d\u000a      second PhD project mentioned above, led to easy further development and\u000d\u000a      transfer of the\u000d\u000a      technology between WestCHEM and M&#246;lndal. Specifically, application to the\u000d\u000a      use of tritium labelling\u000d\u000a      could be more conveniently carried out at the industrial site, which had\u000d\u000a      appropriate safety\u000d\u000a      measures to routinely produce radioactively labelled compounds. In 2010,\u000d\u000a      an overview was\u000d\u000a      published by Nilsson (AstraZeneca) and Kerr [2] showing the development of\u000d\u000a      the collaboration. By\u000d\u000a      2010, three novel air-stable complexes showed great promise, providing\u000d\u000a      effective labelling in short\u000d\u000a      times (hours rather than days) at low loading (usually 0.5 % catalyst\u000d\u000a      loading) to an extended list of\u000d\u000a      substituents with tolerance of a wider list of solvents than could be used\u000d\u000a      for Crabtree's complex,\u000d\u000a      and with excellent selectivity in the site of labelling (through\u000d\u000a      5-membered metallacycle\u000d\u000a      intermediates over slower labelling through 6-membered metallacycle\u000d\u000a      intermediates).

A\u000d\u000a      representative assay in\u000d\u000a      the 2010 overview paper showed that at least 16 radiolabelled products\u000d\u000a      were formed on a\u000d\u000a      particular drug candidate using Crabtree's catalyst, compared with just\u000d\u000a      the single desired product\u000d\u000a      using the new catalyst regime.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers\u000d\u000a    William J Kerr (appointed as Lecturer, WestCHEM, October 1989, Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer from April 1997\u000d\u000a      and Professor of Organic Chemistry from April 2002).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42302","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    WestCHEM develops software to support high-throughput systems\u000a      At the same time that the precursor to PolySNAP, the SNAP-1D software\u000a      package, was being\u000a      developed at WestCHEM to facilitate an integrated approach to full x-ray\u000a      powder-diffraction pattern\u000a      analysis, the pharmaceutical industry was developing automated\u000a      crystallisation systems using\u000a      robotics, and was beginning to generate large volumes of one-dimensional\u000a      diffraction patterns.\u000a      However, there was no software available to process, classify, and\u000a      visualise such data. PolySNAP\u000a      was written under contract from Pfizer specifically to address this\u000a      problem. It was the first software\u000a      to do this and used novel statistics and visualisation methods. Data\u000a      visualisation is a vital\u000a      component of handling large amounts of data. With PolySNAP, time\u000a      expenditure was reduced from\u000a      days to seconds for &gt;100 data sets. It is an almost impossible task to\u000a      classify large data sets\u000a      without these techniques and so any investment in the new robotic hardware\u000a      would have been\u000a      pointless. The software was described by one Pfizer employee as \"like\u000a      having a new spectroscopic\u000a      method made available\". A confidential list of PolySNAP users up to 2010\u000a      is available, which\u000a      contains 72 users with commercial licences (Source 2). The software was\u000a      the property of Glasgow\u000a      University until 2010 when Professor Gilmore retired, at which time it was\u000a      sold to Bruker.\u000a    PolySNAP supplied worldwide with Bruker diffractometers\u000a      Bruker purchased the rights to the program from Pfizer in 2002-2003 for ca.\u000a      &#163;125k (the same as\u000a      the original cost to Pfizer) and started to market PolySNAP commercially\u000a      under licence from\u000a      Glasgow University (Source 1). Until 2010, license fees to the University\u000a      totalled &#163;84,164 (from\u000a      2008 &#163;37,894) (Source 3). Bruker continued to develop this software and\u000a      Gilmore set up a limited\u000a      company partly for this purpose (Allander Science Ltd.) and continues to\u000a      act as a consultant to\u000a      Bruker. Dr Dong was employed full-time by Bruker during the assessment\u000a      period. The\u000a      development of PolySNAP also led to a free computer program called dSNAP\u000a      that uses the same\u000a      ideas to classify and visualise the results of searches on the Cambridge\u000a      Structural Database (see\u000a      below).\u000a    New versions of the software were released: PolySNAP-2, PolySNAP-M, and\u000a      the latest PolySNAP-3.\u000a      PolySNAP-3 is unique in that it allows data from multiple sources,\u000a      techniques or data collection\u000a      strategies to be incorporated into the analysis. For example, data from\u000a      powder diffraction can be\u000a      combined with differential scanning calorimetry and Raman data to give a\u000a      combined analysis and\u000a      more accurate classifications of samples [5, 6]. This method is proving so\u000a      important that Bruker are\u000a      currently extending it to include x-ray fluorescence data in the new\u000a      releases of PolySNAP. It saves\u000a      money because it releases the time of highly paid scientific staff and it\u000a      is also objective, avoiding\u000a      the risk that exists with this sort of data that interpretation can become\u000a      subjective.\u000a    The relationship between Bruker and the University continued until 2010\u000a      when Prof Gilmore\u000a      retired. At that point, Bruker paid the equivalent of two years' license\u000a      fees (&#8364;30k) to purchase the\u000a      software outright. PolySNAP continues to be a part of the company's\u000a      development plan (Source 4).\u000a      Current list price when PolySNAP is purchased separately is &#8364;2,700, and\u000a      approximately 120 have\u000a      been sold since 2004, while Bruker also offers another version, m-SNAP, at\u000a      a list price of &#8364;5,000.\u000a      PolySNAP continues to be sold in combination with all Bruker x-ray powder\u000a      diffractometers.\u000a    PolySNAP utilised across industry and education\u000a      Although the impact beyond the sale of the software is very difficult to\u000a      quantify, the beneficiaries of\u000a      this software are many:\u000a    \u000a      The pharmaceutical industry: Most large pharmaceutical companies use\u000a        PolySNAP: Novartis,\u000a        AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Roche, Syngenta, Sanofi Aventis, and many smaller\u000a        companies. It\u000a        dramatically reduces both the timescale and the reliability of sample\u000a        screening allowing even\u000a        very large datasets (&gt;100,000 samples) to be pre-screened in minutes\u000a        to find the subset of\u000a        patterns most relevant to a given target. Prior to PolySNAP, such\u000a        searches would have used\u000a        reduced patterns in which the powder data are presented as a small set\u000a        of intensities and\u000a        positions for the top 5-10 peaks. PolySNAP was the first program to use\u000a        the full measured data\u000a        in all its analysis steps. High-throughput data are of poor quality and\u000a        using traditional reduced\u000a        patterns is ineffective at best and often worthless.\u000a      Mining industry: e.g., companies such as Anglo Platinum and Mintek in\u000a        southern Africa, where\u000a        PolySNAP software is used to assess the quality of ore samples prior to\u000a        processing into pure\u000a        metals, and to group huge quantities of materials of different origin.\u000a        The software allows the\u000a        companies to carry out rapid comprehensive assessments of ore\u000a        variability in terms of bulk\u000a        mineralogical composition and facilitating decision-making.\u000a      Materials Science: identifying new materials, studying phase changes\u000a        with temperature and\u000a        pressure, simple quantitative analysis of mixtures.\u000a      Forensic science: e.g. South African Police Force have used PolySNAP\u000a        to match samples from\u000a        crime scenes with a database of known samples. It is especially valuable\u000a        when used with\u000a        mineral theft.\u000a    \u000a    A Principal Scientist, Materials Science, at AstraZeneca explains the\u000a      value of PolySNAP (Source\u000a      5):\u000a    \"Identification of a suitable solid form for development of a\u000a        crystalline material still remains a\u000a        great challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Due to the different\u000a        physical properties (e.g.,\u000a        dissolution, stability) of different polymorphs, extensive screening is\u000a        performed during the\u000a        early stages of development to ensure the solid form architecture of the\u000a        proposed molecule\u000a        is fully understood and there have been a number of costly issues where\u000a        compounds have\u000a        had to be reformulated due to changes of form after launch.\u000a    In screening for different solid forms, both manual and automated\u000a        technologies have been\u000a        utilised and a number of high throughput platforms have been developed\u000a        that utilise common\u000a        analytical techniques, e.g., PXRD for analysis of solid form. These\u000a        techniques yield large\u000a        quantities of analytical data which is quite difficult to comprehend and\u000a        can rapidly overwhelm\u000a        operators with excessive data. [...] PolySNAP utilises a wide range of\u000a        mathematical\u000a        techniques to help manage large data sets and successfully guides the\u000a        scientists into not\u000a        only the presence of the different forms but, more importantly, how\u000a        these forms have been\u000a        manufactured and hence how they can be controlled. It provides a range\u000a        of pattern-matching\u000a        methods and allows the user to have full control over understanding the\u000a        date avoiding `black\u000a        box' type results leaving the operator in control and reducing large\u000a        datasets to a much\u000a        smaller number of samples which require interpretation by scientists.\u000a        The results from\u000a        PolySNAP allow rapid identification of `safe' areas of working (e.g.,\u000a        solvents, temperature,\u000a        concentrations, etc.) and where further understanding is required. Most\u000a        recently, the extra\u000a        dimension of adding the capability of other analytical data (e.g.,\u000a        spectroscopic) has provided\u000a        further confidence and opportunities in the pattern matching.\"\u000a    A one-month trial version of the PolySNAP software is available from\u000a      WestCHEM, accompanied by\u000a      a tutorial and trial data (Source 6).\u000a    Visualising the Cambridge Structural Database with dSNAP\u000a      The WestCHEM research that led to PolySNAP also underpinned a free\u000a      computer program called\u000a      dSNAP (Source 7) that classifies and visualises the results of searches on\u000a      the Cambridge\u000a      Structural Database (CSD), a repository of over 500,000 crystal structures\u000a      derived from x-ray and\u000a      neutron diffraction. The CSD is by far the most important source of\u000a      structural data for small\u000a      molecules, but while it is easy to search this database, it can be a\u000a      problem to interpret the results.\u000a      dSNAP is an important tool for this. dSNAP simplifies the problem using\u000a      the same methodology as\u000a      PolySNAP: it clusters the search results into groups that are very similar\u000a      and thus allows the user\u000a      to treat the group as a single entity so reducing the number of structures\u000a      that need to examined.\u000a      Additional tools are provided to assist in this.

In commercial research settings, it is now\u000a      routine to collect thousands of\u000a      x-ray powder-diffraction patterns in a day using crystallisation robots\u000a      and a fast powder\u000a      diffractometer. Many pharmaceutical and materials laboratories carry out\u000a      such work routinely, one\u000a      example being in the pharmaceutical industry where companies need to find\u000a      all the possible\u000a      polymorphs of a drug candidate both to protect their intellectual property\u000a      and to ensure that more\u000a      efficacious forms are not excluded. Using crystallisation robots,\u000a      thousands of potential polymorphs\u000a      are crystallised in small quantities and subjected to x-ray powder\u000a      diffraction and, if possible, to\u000a      Raman spectroscopy.\u000a    Key Research Outcomes\u000a      The motivation for the research carried out at WestCHEM was to explore\u000a      ways to classify the data\u000a      automatically and to provide associated data visualisation tools. The\u000a      PolySNAP software classifies\u000a      the patterns automatically using cluster analysis and multivariate\u000a      statistics showing groups of\u000a      patterns that are similar and thus belong to the same polymorph as well as\u000a      highlighting new\u000a      patterns that do not match the library of known forms [2-4]. From its\u000a      first release, PolySNAP's\u000a      approach has been revolutionary in that it uses every measured data point,\u000a      whereas previously\u000a      software used only the heights and positions of the top 5-10 peaks [6].\u000a      This makes it far more\u000a      robust in its statistics especially with regard to poor quality data,\u000a      which are common in high-\u000a      throughput studies.\u000a    The WestCHEM research has led to a new integrated approach to full\u000a      powder-diffraction pattern\u000a      analysis. It incorporated wavelet-based data pre-processing, parametric\u000a      and non-parametric\u000a      statistical tests for full-pattern matching, and singular-value\u000a      decomposition to extract quantitative\u000a      phase information from mixtures.

Based on Southampton's patented\u000d\u000a      methodology [Section 3], Ilika's work is focused on next-generation\u000d\u000a      applications for the high-growth industries of clean energy and\u000d\u000a      electronics, driving forward innovation to reduce reliance on the world's\u000d\u000a      diminishing supply of hydrocarbon fuels and cutting carbon emissions.\u000d\u000a    Clean technology: Governments have introduced incentives to\u000d\u000a      stimulate the development of electric vehicles (EVs), but mass-market\u000d\u000a      roll-out is being hindered by inadequate battery performance. Ilika's\u000d\u000a      technology, which allows rapid synthesis and screening of new cell\u000d\u000a      chemistries, has increased the energy capacity and charge rates of solid\u000a        state lithium-ion batteries, a market set to be worth $32 billion a\u000d\u000a      year by 2018. In a significant collaboration with Toyota, who since 2008\u000d\u000a      have invested ~&#163;4 million revenue directly into this research [5.1,\u000d\u000a        5.2], Ilika has also filed 9 patents in the period 2008-13 to\u000d\u000a      facilitate further advances in EV through the creation of new battery\u000d\u000a      materials and compositions [5.3]. These are being integrated into\u000d\u000a      batteries for future generations of Toyota's hybrid vehicles, also\u000d\u000a      offering very significant safety benefits over liquid electrolyte\u000d\u000a      batteries. Reducing catalyst materials costs is a key driver in delivering\u000d\u000a      Toyota's vision for fuel cell hybrid vehicle roll-out. Mr Taniguchi\u000d\u000a      (Toyota) states, \"Ilika's fuel cell catalyst formulation is key to\u000d\u000a          Toyota's strategy for cost reduction\", while according to Mr\u000d\u000a      Okajima (Project Manager, Toyota's Frontiers &amp; Advanced Engineering\u000d\u000a      Strategy Department, R&amp;D Management Centre, Japan), \"Ilika's\u000d\u000a          high through-put techniques are essential to overcome some of the\u000d\u000a          technological barriers we face in the development of leading-edge\u000d\u000a          technologies\" [5.4, 5.5]. Ilika has also made an\u000d\u000a      impact in other areas of the automotive industry, working with CeramTec to\u000d\u000a      develop more environmentally-friendly lead-free piezoelectrics in sensors\u000d\u000a      and actuators used for triggering airbags and in fuel injection systems.\u000d\u000a      These are now in use in several German automotive vehicle brands [5.4].\u000d\u000a    The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2020 hydrogen fuel cell\u000d\u000a      vehicles will be responsible for 10% of the new car market, achieving an 8\u000d\u000a      million tonne reduction in UK CO2 emissions between 2010-2020.\u000d\u000a      The prohibitive cost of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells has\u000d\u000a      hindered the growth of this industry. Ilika has worked with Japanese\u000d\u000a      chemicals and materials company Asahi Kasei to develop unique palladium\u000d\u000a      alloy (Pd\/Co\/W) electrocatalysts [5.1] which are ~70% cheaper than\u000d\u000a      `standard' platinum catalysts, making the market penetration of fuel cell\u000d\u000a      vehicles more viable. Ilika has been awarded 3 Carbon Trust Grants to take\u000d\u000a      this work forward (total: ~&#163;438k), plus &#163;150k equity investment in 2012 [5.1,\u000d\u000a        5.6].\u000d\u000a    The future of hydrogen as an energy source is very dependent on the\u000d\u000a      ability to store it safely. Current solutions consume large amounts of\u000d\u000a      energy and raise safety concerns. Ilika worked with Shell to develop a\u000d\u000a      solid metal hydride [5.1, 5.3, 5.4], which is currently being\u000d\u000a      scaled-up and commercialised with Sigma Aldrich, a US-based specialist\u000d\u000a      chemicals company.\u000d\u000a    Digital memory: Phase change memory (PCM) is an emerging\u000d\u000a      technology expected to replace flash in solid-state memory for computers,\u000d\u000a      smart phones, etc., due to its higher performance and capacity to\u000d\u000a      extend battery life. In 2008 Ilika began collaborating with NXP\u000d\u000a      Semiconductors [5.1, 5.3] to optimise new PCM materials through\u000d\u000a      its high throughput screening technology. These are now being used by NXP\u000d\u000a      in embedded memory applications [5.6].\u000d\u000a    Biomaterials: Research into polymers, carried out by Bradley at\u000d\u000a      Southampton, with researchers at the Universities of Edinburgh and\u000d\u000a      Sheffield, produced biomedical applications. This led to the founding of Altrika\u000d\u000a        Ltd in 2009 [5.7], a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ilika,\u000d\u000a      marketing cell-based skin regeneration therapies to treat burns and\u000d\u000a      hard-to-heal wounds. In 2011, its Myskin&#174; and Cryoskin&#174;\u000d\u000a      products were being sold to seven NHS trusts, leading to accelerated\u000d\u000a      recovery, reduced scarring, reduced time in hospital and increased quality\u000d\u000a      of life for ~50 patients with particularly severe burns. In December 2012,\u000d\u000a      Altrika was sold to Adiposet Ltd. [5.7], providing them with\u000d\u000a      quality systems and licenses-to-operate from the Human Tissue Authority\u000d\u000a      and Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency, for expanding its\u000d\u000a      cell bio-processing and bio-banking projects. This strategic decision\u000d\u000a      enabled Ilika to focus on its core cleantech programmes, now 90% of its\u000d\u000a      business.\u000d\u000a    Economic Impact: The direct economic impact on the UK economy is\u000d\u000a      through the formation of a PLC which now employs 35 staff (doubling since\u000d\u000a      2007), including 25 skilled scientists. Its annual turnover has increased\u000d\u000a      from &#163;0.97m (2007) to &#163;2.01m (2012), growing ~25% pa since 2008. Ilika,\u000d\u000a      listed in The Guardian Clean Tech 100, attracts inward investment into the\u000d\u000a      UK, with 83% of its revenue from international companies. It was floated\u000d\u000a      on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange in 2010\u000d\u000a      [5.8] at a market capitalisation of &#163;18.7m and raised ~&#163;5.2m, with\u000d\u000a      a further &#163;5m in May 2012 [5.1, 5.3, 5.9]. Ilika received the New\u000d\u000a      Energy Awards University Spin-out of the Year in 2012 [5.10]. Its\u000d\u000a      business is supported by sales offices in Japan, USA and Germany.\u000d\u000a    Fostering the Impact: Essential to the realisation of the impact\u000d\u000a      was the involvement of the University of Southampton's Centre for\u000d\u000a      Enterprise &amp; Innovation (CEI), which assisted with the protection and\u000d\u000a      exploitation of the IP. Company incubation was supported via\u000d\u000a      SETsquared (Southampton, Surrey, Bath, Bristol &amp; Exeter Universities).\u000d\u000a      Southampton Chemistry fostered Ilika's success by reducing Hayden's\u000d\u000a      workload to enable him to commit 50% of his time as CSO (2005-present).\u000d\u000a      According to Graeme Purdy (CEO, Ilika), \"Brian's role is extremely\u000d\u000a        valuable to Ilika, both in a business development capacity and in\u000d\u000a        providing scientific and technical leadership and credibility with\u000d\u000a        customers\" [5.4]. Ilika occupied research and office space\u000d\u000a      in Chemistry before relocating to the University of Southampton Science\u000d\u000a      Park in 2007. Graeme adds, \"Southampton Chemistry was critical in\u000d\u000a        nurturing Ilika's growth through structured access to space and a close\u000d\u000a        cooperation in the early days of the company\". Ilika continues to\u000d\u000a      hold a facilities agreement with the University, enabling them to access\u000d\u000a      specialist equipment on a commercial basis.\u000d\u000a    Strong collaborations between Southampton Chemistry and Ilika have also\u000d\u000a      continued through industrial CASE studentships, MChem placements, academic\u000d\u000a      consultancies and joint patents. Southampton Chemistry also trained many\u000d\u000a      of the scientists employed by Ilika.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The unique application of combinatorial chemistry in materials science at\u000d\u000a      Southampton has directly underpinned the success of University spin-out,\u000d\u000a      Ilika Technologies. Since 2008, the breadth of applications of the\u000d\u000a      research has allowed Ilika:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      to form a partnership, worth around &#163;4m, with Toyota in the\u000d\u000a        development of battery materials for electric vehicles\u000d\u000a      to optimise new phase change memory materials now used by NXP in\u000d\u000a        embedded memory applications, and\u000d\u000a      to create and sell a subsidiary, Altrika Ltd, that has provided\u000d\u000a        cell-based skin regeneration therapies to 50 severe burn victims.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Between 2008 and 2012, Ilika enjoyed considerable growth, doubling\u000d\u000a      employment to 35 staff, increasing turnover by approximately 25% annually,\u000d\u000a      and floating on the AIM with a market capitalisation of &#163;18.7 million.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Southampton\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Southampton (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Southampton","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007158}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    (the best 3 illustrating the quality of work are starred)\u000d\u000a    \u000a*[3.1] S.

Brian Hayden, Professor of Physical Chemistry, and Dr Samuel\u000d\u000a      Guerin, then a Postdoctoral Research Fellow until 2005, now Senior\u000d\u000a      Scientist at Ilika, worked together in the Centre to develop new\u000d\u000a      combinatorial approaches to solid state materials discovery based on\u000d\u000a      vacuum-deposited thin films on silicon micro-fabricated structures for\u000d\u000a      synthesis, characterisation and screening of these materials [3.1,\u000d\u000a        3.2, 3.3]. Professor Bradley also developed combinatorial synthetic\u000d\u000a      and screening methodologies for bio-polymer materials.\u000d\u000a    Projects to prepare and screen supported heterogeneous catalysts and\u000d\u000a      electrocatalysts were implemented with support from Johnson Matthey, a\u000d\u000a      world leader in advanced materials technology, General Motors, who were\u000d\u000a      keen to explore advances in electrocatalysts for use in electric vehicles,\u000d\u000a      and the EPSRC. Initial work centred on the synthesis and screening of\u000d\u000a      metal alloys, and doped oxide materials.\u000d\u000a    This high throughput methodology was then extended to the synthesis of\u000d\u000a      supported nanoparticles, most significantly allowing the characterisation\u000d\u000a      of particle size and support effects in electrocatalysis, and\u000d\u000a      demonstrating close analogies to heterogeneous catalysis. A range of other\u000d\u000a      functional materials were synthesised and characterised, including\u000d\u000a      piezoelectric perovskite metal oxides, metal hydrides and chalcogenide\u000d\u000a      alloys used for phase change memory applications that are destined to\u000d\u000a      replace flash memory. The high throughput physical vapour deposition (PVD)\u000d\u000a      methodology was used to directly synthesise mixed metal hydrides, which\u000d\u000a      are required for a high capacity, energy efficient and safe method of\u000d\u000a      reversibly storing hydrogen.\u000d\u000a    The key research outcome was the successful application of\u000d\u000a          combinatorial, high-throughput discovery tools to a much wider range\u000d\u000a          of materials, including polymers and solid state materials.\u000d\u000a      The IP obtained through this large multidisciplinary project led to the\u000d\u000a      founding of a University spin-out company, Ilika Plc. in 2004 by\u000d\u000a      Hayden, Bradley and Guerin. The research resulted in several key patents\u000d\u000a      and papers [3.1, 3.2, 3.3] and, in particular, the workflow for\u000d\u000a      solid-state materials discovery (Hayden and Guerin) and bio-active polymer\u000d\u000a      libraries and workflow (Bradley).\u000d\u000a    With the founding of Ilika, Hayden and Bradley became consultants, and\u000d\u000a      Hayden was appointed Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) in 2004, a position he\u000d\u000a      still holds alongside that of Professor of Physical Chemistry at the\u000d\u000a      University. Guerin was appointed as a Research Scientist at Ilika in 2005,\u000d\u000a      where he is now Senior Scientist. The areas of high throughput methods and\u000d\u000a      materials discovery have continued to feature strongly in Professor\u000d\u000a      Hayden's research in Chemistry at Southampton [3.4, 3.5, 3.6] with\u000d\u000a      considerable funding from EPSRC and industry for a range of different\u000d\u000a      projects. Bradley moved to become Professor of High-Throughput Chemical\u000d\u000a      Biology at the University of Edinburgh in 2005, subsequent to the\u000d\u000a      formation of Ilika.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43002","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    After the development of the new Scorpion Primers technology in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Professor Brown (Southampton Chemistry), two scientists\u000d\u000a      from AstraZeneca (Little and Whitcombe &#8212; key contacts) left the company to\u000d\u000a      set up an SME; DxS Ltd, in Manchester in 2001 (and acquired by\u000d\u000a      Qiagen in 2009) [5.1, 5.2]. DxS began developing mutation\u000d\u000a      detection products including an assay for 29 epidermal growth factor\u000d\u000a      receptor (EGFR) mutations. This led to a range of research products (EGFR,\u000d\u000a      KRAS, BRAF, PI3K, T315I), a selection of which progressed into TheraScreen\u000d\u000a      CE-marked diagnostic kits. In January 2008 DxS launched its first\u000d\u000a        companion diagnostic product to allow European sales of Amgen's\u000d\u000a        colorectal cancer drug, Vectibix&#174;. Vectibix was initially rejected\u000d\u000a      by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on the basis of limited efficacy.\u000d\u000a      Amgen then used the DxS kit to stratify the population on the basis of\u000d\u000a      KRAS mutation status and Vectibix was approved by EMA for the KRAS\u000d\u000a      wild-type population. Further diagnostic products followed, with the EGFR\u000d\u000a      kit being used to establish the mutation status of non-small cell lung\u000d\u000a      cancer tumours, to determine likely response to Iressa&#174; or Tarceva&#174;.\u000d\u000a    DxS was acquired by QIAGEN N.V. for US$120m in 2009 [5.1, 5.2].\u000d\u000a      QIAGEN, the world-leading provider of assay technologies, is listed on\u000d\u000a      NASDAQ and the Frankfurt stock exchanges and operates more than 30\u000d\u000a      subsidiaries in 18 countries. The acquisition of DxS was described by\u000d\u000a      QIAGEN's CEO as \"strategically a highly important transaction\" and \"a\u000d\u000a        key element\" in its aim to \"lead in molecular diagnostic-based\u000d\u000a        prevention, profiling and personalised healthcare\" [5.2].\u000d\u000a      The sale was recognised as the \"Transaction of the Year\" (2010) at the\u000d\u000a      Mediscience Awards, London [5.3]. It also benefited the UK\u000d\u000a      economy, with QIAGEN establishing a Centre of Excellence in Pharma\u000d\u000a      Partnering at DxS's Manchester headquarters. The workforce expanded\u000d\u000a        from 67 (2009) to ~160 (2012) after a move to a purpose-fitted facility\u000d\u000a        on the Manchester Science Park in 2010. The success of the DxS\u000d\u000a      assays has led to the growth of QIAGEN's personalized healthcare\u000d\u000a      portfolio, which now makes US$100 million of sales annually (Peer Schatz,\u000d\u000a      CEO, QIAGEN N.V.) [5.4].\u000d\u000a    In the US, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval requires\u000d\u000a      diagnostic assays be associated with a clinical trial. DxS had been\u000d\u000a      approached by drug companies Amgen, BMS Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim to\u000d\u000a      provide companion diagnostic assays for use in their clinical trials. This\u000a        led to the approval (July 2012) of the KRAS kit in the US for use with\u000d\u000a        the colorectal cancer drug, Erbitux&#174; [5.5]. The US market for this\u000d\u000a      drug is expected to be in the region of US$20 million. The EGFR kit was\u000d\u000a      submitted to the FDA in November 2012 for use with the Boehringer\u000d\u000a      Ingelheim non-small cell lung cancer drug, Afatinib; approval was\u000d\u000a        received in July 2013.\u000d\u000a    The EGFR and KRAS kits are now being used worldwide by hospital\u000d\u000a      laboratories, central testing facilities and clinical research\u000d\u000a      organisations. In the US the KRAS assay is being offered by Lab21, Inc,\u000d\u000a      The Mayo Clinic, Applied Diagnostics, Inc, Boyce and Bynum Pathology\u000d\u000a      Laboratories. In January 2013 Clarient also began offering the assay\u000d\u000a        [5.6]. The CEO of Clarient, Carrie Eglinton Manner, stated: \"We\u000d\u000a        believe precision medicine is the new direction in diagnosing and\u000d\u000a        treating cancer and Clarient uses state-of-the-art diagnostic\u000d\u000a        technologies like the therascreen KRAS test to bring clarity and\u000d\u000a        precision to physicians to assist them in making better treatment\u000d\u000a        decisions for their patients. Clarient's comprehensive offering and fast\u000d\u000a        turnaround time coupled with our experience with the therascreen KRAS\u000d\u000a        test permits us to provide a higher level of performance. Also, the fact\u000d\u000a        that it is FDA approved provides Clarient with additional assurance of\u000d\u000a        its quality and reliability.\" [5.6].\u000d\u000a    On-going development of the companion diagnostic portfolio is clear from\u000d\u000a      the agreement between QIAGEN and Eli Lilly, signed in February 2013,\u000d\u000a      to develop companion diagnostics for drugs for all therapeutic areas of\u000d\u000a      interest [5.7]. A further expansion of the biomarker portfolio is\u000d\u000a      evidenced by agreements and licences to develop assays for glioblastoma,\u000d\u000a      lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis, in deals with Insight Genetics, Drug\u000d\u000a      Response Dx, InsermTransfert, Columbia University and the BC Cancer\u000d\u000a      Agency, Canada [5.4].\u000d\u000a    Since 2001 Professor Brown has continued to work on Scorpion design with\u000d\u000a      DxS and later QIAGEN on a consultative basis. Since 2005 this has mainly\u000d\u000a      been channelled through ATDBio (a spin-out company founded by Tom Brown)\u000d\u000a      for the provision of specialist advice and custom oligonucleotides [5.8].\u000d\u000a    David Whitcombe (co-founder of DxS) has stated \"Not only was\u000d\u000a        Professor Brown instrumental in the initial development of Scorpions\u000d\u000a        (suggesting and supplying appropriate blocking and quenching groups, and\u000d\u000a        also creating monomer phosphoramidites), but as the technology matured,\u000d\u000a        he was able to advise and assist on the high quality manufacture of\u000d\u000a        Scorpion constructs. In addition, his group were highly engaged in the\u000d\u000a        investigation of the properties and performance of these molecules. This\u000d\u000a        enabled DxS to move into the manufacture of high quality and high value\u000d\u000a        Diagnostic tests with significant clinical benefits for large numbers of\u000d\u000a        cancer sufferers. Ultimately it was the utility and quality\u000d\u000a          of these tests that underpinned the sale of DxS for US$120m\" [5.9].\u000d\u000a    This is supported by Steve Little (co-founder of DxS), who states that \"The\u000a        core technology used by DxS was Scorpions and, following the\u000d\u000a        acquisition, the technology continues to be used in an expanded range of\u000d\u000a        personalised medicine products provided by QIAGEN.

Around 90% of drugs are effective on only 30-50%\u000d\u000a      of individuals and inappropriate drug treatments can lead to distressing\u000d\u000a      side effects. A colossal US$350bn of the US$770bn global annual drugs\u000d\u000a      sales in 2008 was spent on ineffective medicines.\u000d\u000a    Rapid and accurate analysis of specific DNA sequences can identify groups\u000d\u000a      of patients that are most likely to respond positively to a particular\u000d\u000a      drug, thereby enabling improved and cost-effective care. The need to\u000d\u000a      invent a more effective method of genetic analysis drove a body of\u000d\u000a      research, from 1998 to 2003, by a team in the University of Southampton\u000d\u000a      Chemistry Department, led by Tom Brown [3.1, 3.2 ,3.3]. Brown was\u000d\u000a      a Professor of Biological Chemistry in Southampton Chemistry (until\u000d\u000a      October 2013) and was also the founder of three biotech companies: Oswel,\u000d\u000a      ATDBio and PrimerDesign. Brown's group specialises in nucleic acids\u000d\u000a      chemistry, in particular structure-function relationship, DNA sequence\u000d\u000a      recognition and the application of oligonucleotide chemistry to genetic\u000d\u000a      analysis, diagnostics and therapeutics.\u000d\u000a    The work was conducted in Southampton, mainly by three PhD students under\u000d\u000a      Brown's supervision: Antonio Solinas, Lynda Brown and Jamie Nicol. In\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Dr David Whitcombe and Dr Steve Little at AstraZeneca\u000d\u000a      Diagnostics, the research programme produced an entirely original method\u000d\u000a      of genetic analysis that was particularly suitable for real-time PCR-based\u000d\u000a      diagnostics. AstraZeneca and Oswel Research Products, a company\u000d\u000a      specialising in the synthesis of chemically modified and complex\u000d\u000a      oligonucleotides and their analogues, DNA, RNA and PNA, funded the\u000d\u000a      projects jointly. Oswel was founded by Brown and at the time was based in\u000d\u000a      the University of Southampton.\u000d\u000a    Brown's primary contribution was to provide the unique chemical expertise\u000d\u000a      necessary to construct the complex modified oligonucleotides that form the\u000d\u000a      basis of the technology. Beginning with the analysis of genes involved in\u000d\u000a      breast cancer susceptibility, the group developed bi-functional molecules\u000d\u000a      in which a primer is covalently linked to the probe, which is held in a\u000d\u000a      scorpion-shaped tail (see Figure). The molecules also contain a\u000d\u000a      fluorophore and a quencher. During the Scorpion polymerase chain reaction\u000d\u000a      (PCR), in the presence of the target, the fluorophore and the quencher\u000d\u000a      separate, leading to an increase in the fluorescence emission, which can\u000d\u000a      be detected and measured in the reaction tube.\u000d\u000a    Mechanistic studies followed to test the performance of these systems.\u000d\u000a      Compared with dual-labelled probes, the uni-molecular mechanism acts\u000d\u000a      around four times faster in solution, for instantaneous fluorescence in\u000d\u000a      real-time PCR. Its other key advantages, over standard PCR probes that\u000d\u000a      existed at the time, are enhanced sensitivity, simplified assay design,\u000d\u000a      high signal-to-noise ratio and greater specificity.\u000d\u000a\u0009  (a)\u000d\u000a\u0009  (b)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Figure: (a) illustrating the key elements of a Scorpion primer and (b)\u000d\u000a        how it functions.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The research resulted in several highly cited publications, e.g. [3.1]-[3.5].\u000d\u000a      AstraZeneca filed a US patent for the Scorpion Primers technology\u000d\u000a      in 1999; a UK patent for \"Fluorophore\/quencher labelled oligonucleotides\"\u000d\u000a      was filed in the same year.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43209","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    \"I am delighted to confirm the essential role of Chemistry research in\u000d\u000a        the formation and growth of Atlas Genetics.

Atlas was launched with &#163;500k\u000d\u000a      initial funding, 50% of which came from the Sulis Seedcorn Fund,\u000d\u000a      established by the University of Bath to provide support for new\u000d\u000a      businesses. Prior to the REF period, in 2007 Atlas completed Series A\u000d\u000a      financing of &#163;2 million and the company relocated from the University to a\u000d\u000a      2,500 sq. ft. site on a business park close to Bath (Trowbridge,\u000d\u000a      Wiltshire). The number of full time staff increased to 12 and a commercial\u000d\u000a      programme to develop the Atlas system io&#8482; was initiated.\u000d\u000a    Atlas [C] is currently venture capital funded and to date has\u000d\u000a          raised ca. &#163;22m, including a &#163;16.9M investment in July\u000d\u000a        2011, specifically to develop the io&#8482; system and a\u000d\u000a      molecular Chlamydia test.

Professors Frost and Marken are both engaged as\u000d\u000a      consultants by Atlas Genetics.\u000d\u000a    The Route to Clinical Implementation\u000d\u000a      Atlas' proprietary io&#8482; system enables the sensitivity and\u000d\u000a      accuracy of laboratory testing to be achieved in a point-of-care\u000d\u000a      environment. The io&#8482; system will initially be launched for the\u000d\u000a      testing of Chlamydia [E], allowing clinicians to test and treat patients\u000d\u000a      in a single appointment. Around 40 million tests are carried out for this\u000d\u000a      and related diseases in Europe and the US every year. According to the\u000d\u000a      European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health\u000d\u000a      Organisation [F], Chlamydia is the most frequently reported bacterial\u000d\u000a      sexually transmitted infection (STI), causing an estimated 92 million new\u000d\u000a      cases of genital Chlamydia infection annually and prevalence rates in\u000d\u000a      young people between 5-10% [F]. Rapid diagnosis is key to preventing\u000d\u000a      disease spread. The electrochemical technology at the core of the Atlas io&#8482;\u000d\u000a      tests offer a time-to-result turnaround of less than 30 minutes, which is\u000d\u000a      within the acceptable waiting period for a point-of-care diagnostic test\u000d\u000a      result. The \"test and treat\" approach offers significant benefits to the\u000d\u000a      wider population and could include a decrease of onward transmission and\u000d\u000a      new infections. To establish the validity of the prototype assays, Atlas\u000d\u000a      have collaborated with Professor Charlotte Gaydos of the Johns Hopkins\u000d\u000a      University Medical School (Baltimore, USA; [G]) to evaluate the io&#8482;\u000d\u000a      system technology for Chlamydia detection on 306 patient samples,\u000d\u000a      showing a sensitivity of 98.1% and specificity of 98.0% using the\u000d\u000a      prototype io&#8482; Chlamydia trachomatis assay. This is\u000d\u000a      comparable with that of existing commercial nucleic acid amplification\u000d\u000a      tests (the slower, lab-based and non-point of care, tests Gen-Probe Aptima\u000d\u000a      Combo 2&#8482; and the Roche Cobas Amplicor&#8482; were used as\u000d\u000a      comparator tests). [H, I]. These impressive clinical test results\u000d\u000a        support the adoption of the Atlas io&#8482; tests in clinical\u000d\u000a        environments.\u000d\u000a    Clinical trials with Public Health England (PHE) for the Atlas io&#8482;\u000d\u000a      platform and Chlamydia detection product commence in late 2013 with final\u000d\u000a      formal clinical evaluation in March 2014. The platform launches in Europe\u000d\u000a      with CE certification in 2014, followed by roll-out in the US.\u000d\u000a    Technology for Widening Diagnostic Reach: The in vitro\u000d\u000a      diagnostics (IVD) market is $42 billion and growing at 6% annum, the most\u000d\u000a      rapidly growing areas are molecular diagnostics (valued at $3b and growing\u000d\u000a      at 15% pa) and the point-of-care market (valued at $2.5b and growing at\u000d\u000a      12% pa); the WHO estimates that 499 milliion new STI infections occur each\u000d\u000a      year [J]. Due to the platform nature of the io&#8482; system,\u000d\u000a      Atlas have developed the technology (by commissioning of new bespoke\u000d\u000a      Chemistry from Bath [A]) for a panel of other tests in development to\u000d\u000a      expand their STI test portfolio, including, a duplex test for\u000d\u000a      Chlamydia\/Gonorrhoea (anticipated clinical trials in 2014) and Trichomonas\u000d\u000a      (the most prevalent curable STI in the world, causing an estimated 248\u000d\u000a      million new cases annually of genital T. vaginalis infection). The\u000d\u000a      Atlas io&#8482; Trichomonas vaginalis prototype test has been\u000d\u000a      evaluated at the Johns Hopkins University Medical School. In this\u000d\u000a      published study [G], clinical sample testing demonstrated a sensitivity of\u000d\u000a      95.5% and specificity of 95.7%; these are comparable with that of existing\u000d\u000a      central laboratory nucleic acid amplification tests used for screening\u000d\u000a      patients for T. vaginalis. In 2010 Atlas started work on an\u000d\u000a      immunoassay programme to expand the capabilities of the electrochemical\u000d\u000a      detection platform with a Regional Development Agency grant for the\u000d\u000a      development of a Syphilis assay. The development of redox-active\u000d\u000a      substrates for electrochemical immunoassays and a novel method for signal\u000d\u000a      amplification are being carried out by a directly-funded PhD student in\u000d\u000a      the Frost group at Bath. Atlas is also developing a rapid test cartridge\u000d\u000a      for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) for\u000d\u000a      near-patient testing in high dependency and intensive care units, and\u000d\u000a      other targeted clinical settings.

Fast and accurate detection of\u000d\u000a      DNA is an important sensing methodology for a wide range of biological\u000d\u000a      targets, especially pathogens. Although existing DNA sensor technology is\u000d\u000a      largely based on fluorescence detection, other sensor transduction\u000d\u000a      paradigms are known including electrochemistry. The detection of specific\u000d\u000a      oligonucleotide sequences using electrochemistry has significant\u000d\u000a      advantages: no need for optical sample transparency; direct signal\u000d\u000a      read-out; ease of miniaturisation and device manufacture.\u000d\u000a    In the Bath research that underpins this Impact Case Study, an\u000d\u000a      oligonucleotide detection assay was developed based on electrochemical\u000d\u000a      detection, with an assay based on the appearance of a distinct\u000d\u000a      electrochemical signal when an electronic label (based on ferrocene) is\u000d\u000a      cleaved from an oligonucleotide probe. The higher diffusion mobility and\u000d\u000a      enhanced access of the enzymatically cleaved ferrocene label to the\u000d\u000a      electrode surface results in an increase in ferrocene oxidation current.\u000d\u000a      The labelled oligonucleotide probe is designed with a complementary\u000d\u000a      sequence to a unique section of the target DNA and since cleavage of the\u000d\u000a      label from the probe and appearance of a signal occurs only when the\u000d\u000a      target is present, this allows the sensing of any particular\u000d\u000a      oligonucleotide sequence [1, 2]. The ferrocene labels were designed and\u000d\u000a      prepared in Bath and the initial research generated key intellectual\u000d\u000a      property (detailed below) for a relatively simple, potentially widely\u000d\u000a      applicable assay for detecting DNA targets with no surface modification\u000d\u000a      required, followed up by collaborative knowledge transfer funding [3].\u000d\u000a    This research led to the launch of a University spin out Atlas Genetics\u000d\u000a      Ltd, a diagnostic company developing ultra-rapid point-of-care tests for a\u000d\u000a      range of infectious diseases based on the described ferrocene reagents and\u000d\u000a      electrochemical assay. The technology comprises a low cost instrument (the\u000d\u000a      io&#8482; platform) and a disposable test-specific cartridge to which\u000d\u000a      an unprocessed clinical sample is added and which offers fluidic and\u000d\u000a      temperature control, end-point electronics and software that can be\u000d\u000a      automatically processed without user intervention. All reagents required\u000d\u000a      to perform the test are located on the cartridge in an ambient-stable\u000d\u000a      format. The platform nature of the technology allows detection of multiple\u000d\u000a      pathogens or sequences (multiplexing), offering up to 20 tests per\u000d\u000a      cartridge. To achieve this requires multiple ferrocene labels that produce\u000d\u000a      unique electrochemical signals and the chemical functionality on ferrocene\u000d\u000a      can be modified by synthesis to tune the oxidation potential. The\u000d\u000a      successful ongoing development of novel multiplex ferrocene labels for the\u000d\u000a      Atlas io&#8482; detection system has been led by Frost at Bath and\u000d\u000a      funded by AtlasGenetics [4].\u000d\u000a    Timeframe: The relevant initial work was carried out in 2001-2005,\u000d\u000a      with initial publication in 2004 and subsequently developed further with\u000d\u000a      Atlas Genetics, forming the subject of patent applications and continued\u000d\u000a      collaborative funding to fund further label development.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers\u000d\u000a      Professor Chris Frost (Lecturer, now Professor, at Bath since 1996;\u000d\u000a      synthesis of sensor molecules; lead academic)\u000d\u000a    Dr Toby Jenkins (Lecturer, now Reader, 2000-), Prof Laurie Peter (1990-),\u000d\u000a      Prof Frank Marken (Lecturer, now Professor 2004-) (electrochemistry and\u000d\u000a      prototype device implementation)\u000d\u000a    S C Hillier (2001-05), J Sharp (2009-2012) (PhDs in Frost group); S E\u000d\u000a      Flower (PDRA in Frost research group, 2001-2003)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43210","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    \"[Our] development of medical devices for glucose detection, inward\u000a        investment in our company and successful clinical trialling of these\u000a        devices ... has relied heavily on the underpinning developments from\u000a        [Bath] Chemistry research, and on our ongoing interactions in\u000a        translating [this] into forms appropriate for commercialisation and\u000a        clinical implementation.\" [A]\u000a    Impacts from this work: company, investment, people, new technology,\u000a        clinical testing\u000a    \u000a      A spin-out or new business has generated revenue or profits (GlySure\u000a          Ltd; &#163;13.5M new investment in REF period directly attributed to\u000a        the Bath research [A])\u000a      Highly skilled people having taken up specialist roles that draw on\u000a        their research (GlySure staff expansion to 30, largely in technical\u000a          scientific roles; including a Senior Chemist at Glysure recruited\u000a        from Bath)\u000a      A new diagnostic or medical technology has been developed and trialled\u000a        with patients (glucose sensor developed; full, successful, clinical\u000a          trials carried out)\u000a    \u000a    Clinical Need, GlySure Ltd, and Economic Impact\u000a    The development of an invasive fibre optic continuous glucose\u000a      sensor\/monitoring system is in direct response to the clinical need\u000a      demonstrated by a seminal clinical study in 2001 [B], which showed that\u000a      continuous intensive administration of insulin (allowing tight glycaemic\u000a      control) reduced patient mortality by 40% and morbidity by 37-46%, the\u000a      latter reducing patient length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)\u000a      thus providing economic benefits. GlySure Ltd was founded in 2006 to\u000a      exploit the Bath-developed research [C], with a 20% equity stake held by\u000a      the University of Bath. Based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, it is a venture\u000a      capital funded company with 30 employees, focused on the development and\u000a      launch of a continuous real time invasive optical glucose sensor utilizing\u000a      fluorescent intensity measurements that allows the development of\u000a      continuous glucose monitoring systems in hospital ICUs. GlySure Ltd was\u000a      the lead organization in partnership with Bath and Gilden Photonics on a\u000a      DTI grant, resulting in new IP filings covering long lifetime dendrimer\u000a      fluorophores and synthesis of an alternative diboronic acid receptor\u000a      structure from the Bath research [D]. The automated and continuous dosing\u000a      and response nature of the GlySure device greatly reduces the nursing\u000a      workload required to implement tight glycaemic control, and helps to\u000a      improve compliance.\u000a    The GlySure target market includes the medical and surgical ICU units of\u000a      acute care hospitals. Global admissions in these units alone are\u000a      approximately 8.6 million per year, representing a market opportunity of\u000a      approximately $1.5 billion for sensors. Initial investments resulted for\u000a      GlySure, to develop and build the Bath chemistry into the glucose sensors,\u000a      which has since been followed, in January and November 2012, by\u000a      further tranches of investment on completion of the initial successful\u000a      clinical trials [E], &#163;13.5M of which directly results from the devices\u000a        developed from the Bath chemistry [A]. GlySure Ltd has thus\u000a      established itself as a secure and expanding UK-based company offering\u000a      highly skilled employment opportunities. GlySure continue to invest in\u000a      Chemistry developments at Bath and have appointed Professor James as\u000a      Scientific Advisor: \"Based at the University of Bath, Dr. James is\u000a        generally accepted as the world's expert in boronic acid fluorophore\u000a        chemistry. He has played a pivotal role in optimising glucose selective\u000a        indicator chemistry for continuous measurement in whole blood\" [F].\u000a    IP Acquisition and Technology Development\u000a    The technology development work has been led from Bath, following the\u000a      development of the initial chemistry by James; GlySure acquired relevant\u000a      IP [C] from the more instrument-focused Beckman Coulter and invested\u000a      direct funding in the James group in Bath to develop the chemistry further\u000a      towards the function and performance of the appropriate sensor molecules\u000a      in the required sensing environment [D] Since 2008, through a series of\u000a      funded industry academic transfer projects [5, above], the chemistry has\u000a      been incorporated into devices ready for implementation in the clinical\u000a      environment. To meet the clinical and commercial need, the technology\u000a      developed by GlySure for ICU applications has required the translation by\u000a      James of the fluorescent\/receptor glucose indicator chemistry developed in\u000a      Bath into an optimised form for in situ sensor operation,\u000a      immobilised into an optical cell that is micro machined into the fibre.\u000a      These sensors have advantage over other existing glucose sensor in terms\u000a      of cost, stability and the ease of the fluorescence measurements, as\u000a      corroborated by advantages highlighted by Senseonics, a US company in this\u000a      domain: \"The fluorescent glucose chemistry is ... not subject to the\u000a      instabilities intrinsic to current protein based glucose sensors...\u000a      Consequently, this technology is expected to be inherently more stable and\u000a      accurate.\" [G].\u000a    Clinical Testing\u000a    Since 2008, GlySure have used the Bath-developed chemistry as a\u000a      fundamental underpinning feature of their sensor device, which is intended\u000a      to act as the active glucose sensor in clinical settings. The sensors were\u000a      tested in vivo (in pigs) in 2008-2009, and the sensors entered\u000a      clinical trials in India in 2010. Successful clinical testing has been\u000a      carried out in the ICU environment and presented at the International\u000a      Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, attracting more than\u000a      2000 physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals, and the World\u000a      Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine [H]. Over\u000a      two years of human use trials, the GlySure continuous glucose monitoring\u000a      system has been tested in over 200 intensive care patients to date, in the\u000a      challenging environment of the ICU. The impressive results from these\u000a      clinical trials [H-J] show that the GlySure system is capable of\u000a      monitoring throughout the length of a patient's stay in the ICU.\u000a    Scope for Growth\u000a    In addition to the ICU device described, the fluorescent lifetime glucose\u000a      sensor has been incorporated into a development programme to create a\u000a      small, easy to use continuous glucose sensor for the home diabetic market.\u000a      This lifetime sensor device would allow expansion of the devices into the\u000a      home market which is estimated at &#163;1.5 to &#163;2 billion annually.\u000a    Key Impacts Summary\u000a    2008-2009 - In vivo testing of GlySure device, incorporating\u000a      Bath-developed sensor technology\u000a    2010-2011 - Clinical trials, India; more than 150 patients\u000a    2012 - Clinical Trial outcomes reported, two rounds capitalisation for\u000a      Glysure, &#163;13.5M of which results directly from the Bath chemistry\u000a    2013 - Clinical trials extended to 200 intensive care patients\u000a    2013 - Device enrolled for CE regulatory trial for approval in Europe\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A commercial continuous glucose sensor\/monitor that provides real time\u000a      data has been developed by GlySure, a venture capital funded company\u000a      founded on the basis of Bath chemistry.

James' work maps to the Sensing &amp; Healthcare\u000a      theme within Bath Chemistry, and is a major component of the CASE\u000a      (Catalysis and Sensing for our Environment) initiative led by Bath.\u000a    The capacity of boronic acid receptors to bind diols effectively in water\u000a      has made boronic acids the receptor of choice in the James group at the\u000a      University of Bath, where he has shown that in order to develop saccharide\u000a      selective receptors systems with two boronic acids must be prepared. Such\u000a      sensors, pioneered at Bath, consist of three components; a receptor, a\u000a      support\/spacer, and a read-out unit. The unique element of selectivity for\u000a      glucose is imparted by the specifically configured diboronic acid receptor\u000a      that is covalently linked to the fluorophore and forms part of the single\u000a      molecule indicator chemistry.\u000a    The James group research has shown that in order to prepare a D-glucose\u000a      selective fluorescence sensor, two boronic acid units (only through two\u000a      point binding can saccharide selectivity be engineered), a hexamethylene\u000a      linker (D-glucose selective spacer) and a fluorophore (read-out) must be\u000a      included [1, 2]. The sensor used in the current system developed by\u000a      GlySure Ltd consists of two boronic acids, hexamethylene linker and\u000a      fluorophore which is then attached to a hydrogel polymer.\u000a    The chemistry has been developed over the last decade [3, 4], and has\u000a      been funded by a combination of research council, direct industry and DTI\u000a      funding [5]. The specific application in glucose sensing that is relevant\u000a      to the commercialisation and clinical implementation has been patented (US\u000a      7358094) and following the purchase of this patent from Beckman-Coulter by\u000a      GlySure Ltd, the continued development of the chemistry has focused on the\u000a      specific requirements of the GlySure sensor system [6].\u000a    The development of these technologies has been furthered, into human\u000a      clinical testing, with GlySure's resources and expertise focused on\u000a      completion of existing fluorescent intensity based measurement systems\u000a      using the Bath chemistry. The targeting of this work towards the GlySure\u000a      sensor has led to Professor James' appointment as Scientific Advisor to\u000a      GlySure Ltd, emphasising the direct link of the Bath-developed chemistry\u000a      to the product.\u000a    Timeframe\u000a    The work relevant to the development of the development of the sensor\u000a      being used by GlySure Ltd in its devices has been carried out in the\u000a      timeframe since 2001. The critical step of incorporating established\u000a      boronic acid sensors into appropriate polymer support matrices and their\u000a      optimisation and development for operation in the responsive flow\u000a      environment was carried out initially between 2002 and 2005. This element\u000a      of the research, crucial to the GlySure technology, resulted in a patent\u000a      filed in 2003 (\"Sensor system for saccharides\"; see Section 5), and has\u000a      been developed subsequently in ongoing research by the James group in Bath\u000a      [6].\u000a    Key Researchers\u000a    Professor Tony James (Bath since 2000; synthesis of sensor molecules and\u000a      support scaffolds; lead academic)\u000a    K.

In 2010-2011 the South West UK\u000a      Children's Burn Centre at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol (an NHS Regional\u000a      Centre with a 10 million population catchment area), the main clinical\u000a      partner in this study, treated more than 700 children for serious burn\u000a      injuries. Around 10% of children who are burned become infected, which\u000a      increases the likelihood of scarring and disfigurement and in some cases\u000a      can even cause death. The problem is obtaining clarity in diagnosis, and\u000a      the dressing being developed at Bath provides quick evidence of infection\u000a      without need to remove the dressing, informing clinical decision making.\u000a    Engaging and Influencing Clinicians and Clinical Research\u000a    The development of responsive wound dressings suitable for implementation\u000a      in the clinical environment is a partnership with the clinical community.\u000a      The key direct clinical collaborator is Dr Amber Young, Consultant\u000a      Paediatric Anaesthetist, lead for South-West Burns Unit at Frenchay\u000a      Hospital, but the impact of the work has also been manifest in the reach\u000a      into the mainstream clinical practice community. The concept of using such\u000a      responsive sensors, based on technology being patented by Bath Chemistry\u000a      [A] has also led to substantial influence and attitude changing in the\u000a      broader clinical community. Jenkins is a regular speaker at clinical\u000a      forums, and is a passionate advocate for the role of these advanced\u000a      chemistry solutions in saving lives of vulnerable patients. It is\u000a      extremely unusual for core chemists to be invited into such forums, but\u000a      Jenkins is now a regular invited participant at high profile and\u000a      influential clinical events, for example, the only chemistry plenary\u000a      speaker at the International Society for Burns Injuries in September 2012,\u000a      a large forum of 1250+ practising nurses and doctors investigating the\u000a      latest methods of clinical practice. The high degree of awareness raising\u000a      that Jenkins has managed to achieve is emphasised by his impact at such\u000a      events, where \"his work had a real \"eye-opening\" effect in challenging\u000a        current clinical practice and offering alternative solutions\" [B].\u000a      This is augmented by ongoing interactions with healthcare professionals in\u000a      the British Burns Association and elsewhere. This raising of awareness and\u000a      changing attitudes towards the potential of a system that would aid\u000a      clarity of diagnosis and ease of treatment, has engaged clinicians in this\u000a      debate.\u000a    The research has also made a major contribution to the founding of a\u000a      charity, the Healing Foundation Children's Burns Research Centre [C;\u000a      Jenkins lead academic in the \"Clinical Management\" theme]. The Bath\u000a        research has been used directly to secure at least &#163;1.5M charitable\u000a        funding for the new Centre [B].\u000a    Prototype testing and clinical development\u000a    The development of prototype dressings has been carried out through\u000a      initial ex vivo porcine testing and pre-clinical trials at the\u000a      Blonde-McIndoe Research Foundation, one of the leading charities funding\u000a      clinical work in the remediation of burns injuries, who quote that \"A real\u000a      need therefore exists to develop novel ways to detect and treat burn wound\u000a      infections, and we are working with collaborators at the University of\u000a      Bath and South West Children's Burns Centre, Frenchay Hospital, Bristol to\u000a      develop innovative ways of monitoring infection\" [D]. The manufacturing of\u000a      prototype wound dressings has also been established with industry partners\u000a      (M&#246;lnycke AB Healthcare (Sweden), Hartmann AG (Germany) and Altrika Ltd\u000a      (UK)), translating the research into a viable candidate technology. In\u000a      addition to prototyping, the group are pursuing follow-on implementation\u000a      studies, with publication in clinical journals, establishing a high degree\u000a      of clinical involvement and `buy in' at this early stage, to ensure rapid\u000a      clinical take up of the product when manufactured [E]. Initial direct\u000a        clinical use has also been demonstrated &#8212; having been adopted within\u000a      an NIHR portfolio project [C], an initial cohort of six patients has been\u000a      recruited and used for research-led clinical trials of the effect of burn\u000a      and blister exudates on the Bath-developed prototype wound dressings. This\u000a      was carried out by a charity-funded clinical research nurse whose funding\u000a      resulted from the Bath Chemistry research, providing vital clinical\u000a      information towards wider trialling.\u000a    Community and Media, Raising Awareness and Changing Behaviour\u000a    The Bath research has been instrumental in raising the profile of this\u000a      area. By offering a potentially radical solution to many of the issues of\u000a      diagnosis, it has focused wide attention on the issue of children's burns\u000a      in the region, impacting on education, awareness and attitude changing\u000a      amongst the directly concerned community &#8212; the patients, represented by\u000a      parents and carers of infant burns victims or potential burns victims and\u000a      amongst clinical practitioners: \"it is no exaggeration to say that\u000a        exposure to this research has changed the way in which I think about the\u000a        considerable clinical issues in this challenging area\" [B]. In\u000a      partnership with the South West Children's Burns Centre and the Healing\u000a      Foundation Children's Burns Research Centre, Jenkins and his work have\u000a      been effectively used as a vehicle for publicising the risks of apparently\u000a      innocuous, small volumes of hot liquids to small children [F]. This has\u000a      enabled the development of an educated community of hundreds of\u000a      adults, and of educating children in the risks, through programmes\u000a      of school visits.\u000a    The patients involved represent a group whose injuries stir strong\u000a      emotions and sympathy in the general public. Through a concerted effort\u000a      led by Jenkins and Young, a \"star patient\" (Isambard, who fortunately made\u000a      a full recovery from his dreadful burns injuries) has been used as an\u000a      immediately identifiable vehicle for education, awareness-raising and to\u000a      motivate researchers, clinicians and fund-raisers, through his clinical\u000a      case study:\u000a    Isambard was a 2 year old child who knocked a cup of hot tea over\u000a        himself, causing 32% total body surface area burns (partial thickness).\u000a        He was airlifted to Frenchay hospital and treated. Two days post burn he\u000a        became very pyrexic and non-specifically unwell. Infection was suspected\u000a        and he was brought into the OR. In the OR a `lively' discussion between\u000a        the clinicians took place: should he be treated aggressively, removing\u000a        his dressings &#8212; potentially saving his life but guaranteeing life-long\u000a        scarring, or treated conservatively, leave dressings on and watch and\u000a        wait. In the event the latter approach was used &#8212; with a very good\u000a        outcome, but the decision was not informed by clinical\u000a          knowledge\u000a    The work has had impact far beyond the usual dissemination and has a very\u000a      strong outreach element [G]. This has included articles in magazines such\u000a      as New Scientist, and still more widespread reach and impact in mass\u000a      media, on television and radio, and in national newspapers and news\u000a      outlets (e.g. the Daily Mail and BBC). In addition the BBC recently filmed\u000a      in Jenkins' laboratory, as part of a major piece in the popular, wide\u000a      reach television programme \"Bang Goes the Theory\" [H], which regularly\u000a      attracts total audiences of around 4 million, on the dangers of hot\u000a      drinks, children's burns and newly developed treatments for those injured\u000a      in this way.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Half of all burn injuries occur in children and around 10% of children\u000a      who are burnt become infected by disease-causing bacteria that can\u000a      increase the likelihood of scarring and in some cases cause death.

Typically the only way to diagnose infection\u000a      is to expose the wound to allow examination by swabbing and\u000a      microbiological analysis; this process takes time (typically 24 hours) and\u000a      dramatically increases the danger of severe infection, scarring, and the\u000a      consequent, potentially fatal, side effects, such as sepsis and toxic\u000a      shock syndrome (especially in children). The research, carried out since\u000a      2007, targets this vital clinical issue, by developing responsive wound\u000a      dressings for burn victims, particularly children.\u000a    The research uses phospholipid vesicles dispersed in a composite hydrogel\u000a      matrix, which retain some characteristics of eukaryotic cell membranes.\u000a      The vesicles encapsulate a self-quenched non-toxic dye (fluorescein),\u000a      which is released following the degradation of the lipid vesicles by\u000a      bacterial virulence factors including Phenol Soluble Modulins (PSMs) from\u000a      S. aureus and rhamnolipids from P. aeruginosa, which are\u000a      key infection agents. Release of the dye into the surrounding matrix\u000a      causes fluorescence `switch on', clearly observable by eye and a key paper\u000a      has been published which focuses on the sensor detection \/ response\u000a      chemistry underpinning the developments being implemented [1].\u000a    In the development phase building on this initial sensor chemistry,\u000a      laboratory scale prototype dressings have been developed with vesicle\u000a      compositions that optimise stability and toxin sensitivity; the vesicles\u000a      are stable in wound exudate taken from patients in clinical environments,\u000a      and at the pH range and temperature range expected in the burn environment\u000a      [2]. The dressings therefore give a clear visible indication of infection\u000a      in situ without need to remove the dressing and this is key to its\u000a      benefits in the clinical environment.\u000a    An essential component of this research programme is an absolute focus on\u000a      clinical need, and manufacturability, and this has been supported by\u000a      direct industrial and translation funding [3]. A range of working\u000a      prototypes are available for in-vivo studies on murine and porcine\u000a      models, while manufacturing partners are engaged with small scale, GMP\u000a      compliant production. The research is also being targeted at better\u000a      understanding of mechanisms of bacterial toxicity, with a particular focus\u000a      on infection within paediatric burns, as noted below.\u000a    Timeframe: Research commenced in 2007, with initial key\u000a      publication in 2010 and subsequently developed in partnership with\u000a      clinicians at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol and the South-West Children's\u000a      Burns Centre, and clinical charity research partners.\u000a    Key Researchers\u000a    Dr Toby Jenkins (Lecturer, now Reader; Bath since 2000; anti-microbials,\u000a      functional wound dressing development; lead academic)\u000a    Dr J.

Crucially, these catalysts are\u000d\u000a      based on titanium and zirconium rather than tin, antimony or mercury, thus\u000d\u000a      eliminating the environmentally unfriendly heavy metals from\u000d\u000a      the catalysts used in these large-scale industrial polymerisation\u000d\u000a      processes.\u000d\u000a    Demonstrating the impact of this work involves a detailed following of\u000d\u000a      the original Bath-invented intellectual property but also derivative\u000d\u000a      patents and processes advanced by the partner industries and their\u000d\u000a      successors (ICI Synetix, Johnson Matthey; [A]). The impact outlined here\u000d\u000a      focuses on PET and PU. Developing commercial applications of the third\u000d\u000a      strand of Bath Group 4 catalysts (for PLA manufacture) is more recent,\u000d\u000a      with patent applications in 2006 (Johnson Matthey; [A]) and a recent\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Corbion Purac leading to implementation of\u000d\u000a      Bath-developed benign tin-replacement catalysis for pilot scale PLA\u000d\u000a      manufacture and patent filing in 2013 [A].\u000d\u000a\u0009A critical element of the Bath\u000d\u000a      research is not only the specific catalysts developed in the published\u000d\u000a      work but the fact that these innovations, and the sharing of the\u000d\u000a      intellectual property with Johnson Matthey, through extensive\u000d\u000a      collaboration and a Royal Society Industry Fellowship for Davidson,\u000d\u000a      resulted in the methodology from Bath heralding a new, more sophisticated\u000d\u000a      molecular approach to catalyst design in the PET and PU areas, thereby\u000d\u000a          influencing the development of the whole metal alkoxide Johnson\u000d\u000a          Matthey catalyst portfolio. The Bath-developed materials have\u000d\u000a      been described as \"first in class\", and have also resulted in the\u000d\u000a      establishment of rigorous molecular design process in the industrial\u000d\u000a      environment [B]:\u000d\u000a    \"In addition to the specific catalysts and IP ..., the methodology\u000d\u000a        from Bath influenced the whole JM Ti- and Zr alkoxide catalyst\u000d\u000a        portfolio, including establishing the rigorous molecular design of these\u000d\u000a        families of materials, and the Bath Chemistry and materials are\u000d\u000a        acknowledged as being \"first in class\" in this area.... there is thus no\u000d\u000a        doubt that many of these developments including the whole VertecTM\u000d\u000a        and SnapcureTM portfolio can be linked directly\u000d\u000a        to the Bath research.\"\u000d\u000a    In March 2011 Dorf Ketal, an Indian Chemicals company\u000d\u000a        who are one of the largest in the world, purchased PET and PU catalyst\u000d\u000a        intellectual property from Johnson Matthey in a &#163;4.6M\u000d\u000a      transaction [C]; this income can be directly\u000d\u000a          attributable to the Bath research [B]. Due to the high value\u000d\u000a      of the product portfolio, the sale of the order book was blocked by the UK\u000d\u000a      Office of Fair Trading [D]. The intellectual property covered titanium\u000d\u000a      citrate-based Vertec catalysts first characterised by Bath that are used\u000d\u000a      in PET manufacture and the titanium alkoxide 'Snapcure' catalysts\u000d\u000a      developed from Bath chemistry and used in PU manufacture. Dorf Ketal\u000d\u000a      rebranded these products as part of their Unilink range and they are now\u000d\u000a      manufactured at their new Mundra plant in India:\u000d\u000a    From Dorf Ketal release [E]: \"the plant will produce up to\u000d\u000a        10,000 metric tons of the industry's broadest portfolio of titanates\u000d\u000a        annually, making it the largest facility of its kind in the world.

In addition,\u000d\u000a      the price of antimony catalysts has recently escalated rapidly due to\u000d\u000a      mining restrictions in China such that there is now an additional\u000d\u000a      significant upsurge in take-up of titanium-based catalysts from a cost\u000d\u000a      basis. Large-scale manufacturers have made substantial process\u000d\u000a      improvements in PET manufacture that allow good quality titanium-based\u000d\u000a      PET; Dorf Ketal are supplying to this market. For example, a new\u000d\u000a      ThyssenKrupp Uhde (Germany) process makes PET through a route in which\u000d\u000a      Vertec titanium-based catalysts are the best on the market by far at\u000d\u000a      matching antimony catalyst performance. These PET catalysts are part of\u000d\u000a      the portfolio taken on by Dorf Ketal, to supply some of the largest PET\u000d\u000a      resin plants in the world (&gt;600 tonnes per day currently with up to\u000d\u000a      1500 tpd planned) [B]; conversion in these plants results in substantial\u000d\u000a      reduction in antimony usage.\u000d\u000a    The Snapcure (now Unilink) solution has also been implemented widely for\u000d\u000a      PU [F], with significant trials run with a number of large mercury\u000d\u000a      catalyst users including full scale trials. This new process, based on the\u000d\u000a      molecular design principles introduced by Bath, is increasingly relevant\u000d\u000a      due to the onset of REACH regulations, which are, increasingly, severely\u000d\u000a      restricting the use of mercury.\u000d\u000a\u0009These new Bath-developed catalysts have\u000d\u000a      thus had impact through their adoption in manufacturing processes, as a\u000d\u000a      replacement for undesirable heavy metal catalysts (notably antimony and\u000d\u000a      more recently mercury). In addition to their adoption in manufacturing\u000d\u000a      plants, aspects of these catalysts and associated processes have been sold\u000d\u000a      on internationally, providing evidence that this chemistry is of ongoing\u000d\u000a      value and impact.\u000d\u000a    Key Impacts Timeline\u000d\u000a      2008 &#8212; Snapcure range of products launched by Johnson Matthey\u000d\u000a      2008-2010 - Pilot scale developments of process for various polymerisation\u000d\u000a      products\u000d\u000a      2010 - Large scale implementation of Snapcure catalysis solution for\u000d\u000a      polyurethane\u000d\u000a      2011 - VERTEC portfolio of PET and PU catalyst IP acquired and used by\u000d\u000a      Dorf Ketal, generating &#163;4.6M income from IP sale alone\u000d\u000a      2011 - Dorf Ketal implementing Ti catalysts in PET plant &#8212; branded\u000d\u000a      Unilink, and manufactured at new Mundra plant in India demonstrating\u000d\u000a      increasing global reach and uptake\u000d\u000a      2011-2013 - Molecular design principles applied to new Group 4 metal PLA\u000d\u000a      catalysts trialled with Corbion Purac and patent application filed\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Catalysis is a major UK industry strength and wealth generator for the UK\u000d\u000a      economy.

This work has focused\u000d\u000a      on the use of more environmentally friendly metals such as titanium as\u000d\u000a      replacements for heavy metals such as tin, antimony and mercury in areas\u000d\u000a      such as catalysis. The research is aligned to the Catalysis and\u000d\u000a      Sustainable Chemical Technologies research themes within Bath Chemistry.\u000d\u000a    The development of new and increasingly active homogeneous catalysts has\u000d\u000a      been one of the main driving forces behind recent advances in modern\u000d\u000a      organometallic chemistry. One such area has been the need to develop new\u000d\u000a      Lewis acid catalysts to mediate industrial polymerisation processes such\u000d\u000a      as PET and PU manufacture, as well as for the ring-opening polymerisation\u000d\u000a      (ROP) of cyclic esters. The chemistry is motivated by a drive for the use\u000d\u000a      of more sustainable metals in these high-volume manufacturing processes\u000d\u000a      and also by the introduction of a new generation of commercially viable,\u000d\u000a      sustainable degradable plastics available from renewable resources.\u000d\u000a    Chelating N- and O-containing ligands, which are capable of providing a\u000d\u000a      range of stable steric and electronic environments for catalytically\u000d\u000a      active metal centres, have been the subject of considerable research for\u000d\u000a      some time, not least for their ability to bind active metal centres in\u000d\u000a      well-defined environments [1, 2]. This has attracted huge industrial\u000d\u000a      interest, since the area of new catalyst development is highly competitive\u000d\u000a      and requires a continuous process of innovation and materials development,\u000d\u000a      to facilitate both new processes and new target products.\u000d\u000a    The important breakthrough resulting from this underpinning\u000d\u000a      metallo-organic coordination chemistry was the discovery in 2001-2002,\u000d\u000a      during Davidson's time as a Royal Society Industry Fellow with Johnson\u000d\u000a      Matthey (1999-2003), that well-defined molecular titanium-based complexes\u000d\u000a      being developed at Bath were highly effective in replacing the heavier and\u000d\u000a      more toxic metals that were used in PET and PU polymerisation processes,\u000d\u000a      notably tin, antimony and mercury. This initial discovery immediately led\u000d\u000a      to follow-on industrial funding, a detailed understanding of\u000d\u000a      structure-activity relationships for titanium complexes with commercially\u000d\u000a      viable ligands, and the protection of the chemistry though patents led by\u000d\u000a      the industrial partners as detailed below. Subsequent development in\u000d\u000a      Davidson's group and at Johnson Matthey refined the molecular chemistry\u000d\u000a      and processes, leading to functional catalysts that could be implemented\u000d\u000a      in relevant industrial contexts. For example, this work included the\u000d\u000a      synthesis and structural characterisation of a series of Group 4 metal\u000d\u000a      complexes and assessment of their potential as Lewis acid catalysts for\u000d\u000a      polyester synthesis. In this work, a series of ligands were prepared and\u000d\u000a      their Group 4 metal complexes studied, allowing isolation of well-defined\u000d\u000a      titanium and zirconium complexes which were shown to be active catalysts\u000d\u000a      for the ROP of cyclic esters such as 03b5-caprolactone and lactide with\u000d\u000a      excellent levels of conversion and control [3]. This work was subsequently\u000d\u000a      developed further with industrial collaborators and funding [4, 5],\u000d\u000a      exerting influence over the development of the entire Johnson Matthey\u000d\u000a      metal alkoxide catalyst portfolio.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers\u000d\u000a      Professor Matthew Davidson (Whorrod Professor of Sustainable Chemical\u000d\u000a      Technologies, lead academic; at Bath since 1999)\u000d\u000a      Dr A L Johnson (PDRA, now Lecturer, at Bath 2000-), Dr M D Jones (PDRA,\u000d\u000a      now Senior Lecturer; at Bath 2004-), Dr C J Chuck (Industrial PhD and\u000d\u000a      PDRA, now Whorrod Fellow; at Bath 2004-)\u000d\u000a      Dr E Gullo (Industrial PDRA, 2004-2007); G F Eade (2001-2004), C L Doherty\u000d\u000a      (2004-2007), A L Chmura (2006-2009) (PhD students in Davidson group); M D\u000d\u000a      Lunn (2001-2005), L Paches (2004-2008) (Industrial PhD students in\u000d\u000a      Davidson group)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43305","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The major impact of research conducted in the Chemistry department\u000d\u000a      relates to commercial impact with regard to the bio-pharmaceutical\u000d\u000a      industry and impact on practitioners and services. The generation of a\u000d\u000a      pure drug was made possible through the development of new synthesis\u000d\u000a      routes that made the launch of phase 2 clinical trials possible. Based on\u000d\u000a      the research outcomes, and as a result of the Phase 2 trials, TauRx was\u000d\u000a      able to raise &#163;320 million in external investment, now employs 17\u000d\u000a      chemists, 5 biologists, and 14 clinicians. In relation to chemistry\u000d\u000a      activities alone TauRx under Storey's supervision is now working in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with 7 companies: Shasun Pharma Solutions (Newcastle upon\u000d\u000a      Tyne, UK), Roberts Chemicals (UK), Lonza Pharma (Visp, Switzerland),\u000d\u000a      Bohinger (USA), Bayer Schering (Berlin), Piramal Healthcare (Newcastle and\u000d\u000a      Berlin), and Almac Sciences (Edinburgh and Craigavon). Through these\u000d\u000a      commercial collaborations, three centres have been established to each\u000d\u000a      manufacture 5 tonnes of the candidate drug as part of the validation\u000d\u000a      campaign based on the patent [4]. Each validation campaign represents an\u000d\u000a      income of &#163;2.5 million for the companies concerned within the REF period.\u000d\u000a      In addition the ongoing manufacture of 400 tonnes between the three sites,\u000d\u000a      to be completed by May 2015 to coincide with completion of the Phase 3\u000d\u000a      trials, represents a total investment already achieved for these companies\u000d\u000a      of approximately &#163;35 million.\u000d\u000a    Shasun Pharma Solutions Ltd has advised that the company had an initial\u000d\u000a      production of 6 metric tonnes of the drug, and has now established a\u000d\u000a      manufacturing capability of 150 metric tonnes per annum, which will\u000d\u000a      potentially increase to 250 metric tonnes per annum. This would see\u000d\u000a      commercial revenues in the longer term reaching several hundreds of\u000d\u000a      millions of pounds. There will also be longer term impact for Shasun UK\u000d\u000a      and Shasun India resulting from increased demand for the drug, both in\u000d\u000a      terms of commercial return and job creation throughout the supply chain\u000d\u000a      [a].

For example, should the API requirement reach 500 metric tonnes\u000d\u000a        per annum, Shashun UK would need to invest in equipment from UK\u000d\u000a        suppliers of up to &#163;10M and procure goods and services from the north\u000d\u000a        East region of up to &#163;5M. Manufacture of the API on this scale could\u000d\u000a        lead to the creation of up to 80 jobs at the Shashun UK site.\" [a]\u000d\u000a    A second manufacturer is Piramal Healthcare (Newcastle upon Tyne, UK).\u000d\u000a      Piramal advise that to meet the requirements of producing tablets at the\u000d\u000a      amounts required for the initial trials the company has engaged nine\u000d\u000a      further employees at its Morpeth facility, with a current project revenue\u000d\u000a      in excess of USD 1 Million for FY 2013 and 2014. The company states that\u000d\u000a      this revenue provides a platform for the company to grow and develop its\u000d\u000a      team. \"Tablet supply is now approaching 1,500,000 with batches released\u000d\u000a        to clinical sites in the UK, Europe, US and Asia, this is truly a\u000d\u000a        program with global reach.

Roberts Chemicals Ltd describe the\u000d\u000a      company's role in supply and logistics for procurement of starting\u000d\u000a      materials. \"The financial impact on Roberts is to have enabled\u000d\u000a        strategic growth planning at a very early stage in the company's\u000d\u000a        development. Critically, the company has been able to promote and market\u000d\u000a        its next generation business model much more forcefully than expected.\u000d\u000a        This has led to an international portfolio of users of its business\u000d\u000a        model-cleverly adapted to the current economic downturn. TauRx are about\u000d\u000a        to undertake a large manufacturing validation campaign at three major\u000d\u000a        pharma companies.......Roberts will supply the starting materials for\u000d\u000a        these campaigns\" [c].\u000d\u000a    Looking to the future, a potential longer term impact, resulting from the\u000d\u000a      synthetic and analytical chemistry performed in the Chemistry department\u000d\u000a      under Storey's supervision relates to the clinical trials of the drugs\u000d\u000a      developed. The Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust\u000d\u000a      has direct clinical experience with methylthioninium chloride (MTC) and\u000d\u000a      leuco-methylthioninium bis(hydromethanesulfonate) (LMTM) drugs developed\u000d\u000a      in the TauRx project, and is involved in clinical trials. The Trust\u000d\u000a      confirms: \"In AD, in addition to extracellular deposition of b-amyloid\u000d\u000a        protein, there is also intracellular aggregation of tau protein. Several\u000d\u000a        lines of evidence indicate that aggregation of tau protein is central to\u000d\u000a        neurodegeneration in AD. .Numerous laboratory studies show that MTC,\u000d\u000a        when administered in various forms, is effective in disaggregating tau\u000d\u000a        protein... Data from a large phase-2 clinical trial of MTC also provides\u000d\u000a        some evidence of benefit in AD. Based on the Phase &#8212; 2 experience TauRx\u000d\u000a        elected to discontinue clinical studies with MTC and develop\u000d\u000a        leuco-methylthioninium bis(hydromethanesulfonate) (LMTM)\" [d]. As a\u000d\u000a      consequence of the success of these Phase 2 trials, a series of Phase 3\u000d\u000a      trials were organised which commenced in November 2012. These involve an\u000d\u000a      international trial of 1,800 patients, with the data release scheduled for\u000d\u000a      May 2015. In the opinion of a leading consultant from the trust, \"if\u000d\u000a        LMTM is shown to have the expected efficacy in the Phase-3 AD and FTD\u000d\u000a        studies then it has the potential to be a `Game Changer' in terms of how\u000d\u000a        we manage these conditions\" [d].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects one in seven of the population over 60\u000d\u000a      years of age, and represents an increasing burden on worldwide medical and\u000d\u000a      care resources. Treatments currently available are symptomatic. Despite\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical industry efforts there has been little indication of a\u000d\u000a      marketable product for long-term treatment.\u000d\u000a    To address this problem, a joint venture was established in 2001 between\u000d\u000a      the University of Aberdeen and TauRx Pharmaceuticals. A team was created\u000d\u000a      of chemists, biologists, animal behaviourists, working together with a\u000d\u000a      clinical trial team. A drug effective against the progress of AD based on\u000d\u000a      the compound methylene blue was synthesised and scaled up within the\u000d\u000a      Chemistry Department (led by Professor John Storey), with a quality that\u000d\u000a      was proved acceptable through successful phase two clinical trials\u000d\u000a      (2006-8), and is now used in phase three clinical trials which are due to\u000d\u000a      complete in 2015.

Unlike\u000d\u000a      the vast majority of large pharmaceutical companies and academic groups,\u000d\u000a      the Aberdeen team's approach to the Alzheimer's problem was not to use\u000d\u000a      beta amyloid, but rather concentrated on the disaggregation of tau protein\u000d\u000a      &#8212; in 2001 this approach was distinctive and arguably unique.\u000d\u000a    Clinical trials and investigations cannot take place without a fully\u000d\u000a      developed and potentially efficacious drug candidate. The purity of such\u000d\u000a      drugs has to meet the criteria of the Pharmacopeia and competent\u000d\u000a      regulatory authority guidelines for each region. The challenges to be met\u000d\u000a      by the Chemistry team were to discover a suitable drug candidate and\u000d\u000a      follow-on molecules for future clinical development, and to prepare the\u000d\u000a      drug to a purity commensurate with a pharmaceutical product. This required\u000d\u000a      the team to develop a synthesis suitable for scale up, and to develop\u000d\u000a      suitable testing and analytical protocols for both products and\u000d\u000a      impurities. Work continued to then transfer this technology to facilities\u000d\u000a      capable of scale up to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations\u000d\u000a      operated in Europe (by Lonza), in the UK (Shasun Pharma Solutions) and in\u000d\u000a      the USA (Bohringer). Working with the team of chemists based in Aberdeen,\u000d\u000a      this material has then been formulated suitable for use as a final\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical product.\u000d\u000a    A suitable drug candidate was identified early in the project. The\u000d\u000a      molecule in question, methylene blue (methylthioninium chloride), was\u000d\u000a      commercially available as a dye. The quality of this material was very\u000d\u000a      variable and did not meet regulatory standards for an active\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Despite a number of attempts by various\u000d\u000a      chemical companies worldwide over the years to synthesise this molecule to\u000d\u000a      a suitable level of purity in order to treat other medical indications\u000d\u000a      (malaria, cancer staining, urinary tract infection etc.), this goal had\u000d\u000a      proved elusive.\u000d\u000a    The design of a new, efficient and high yielding synthetic approach was\u000d\u000a      therefore required in order to unlock the true potential of this molecule\u000d\u000a      as a drug and to make a clinical trial possible. Two new innovative routes\u000d\u000a      were devised and taken from milligram scale through to 10-litre scale in\u000d\u000a      the laboratories in Aberdeen. This involved the design and establishment\u000d\u000a      of a scale-up laboratory within the Department of Chemistry with 2, 5 and\u000d\u000a      10 litre reactor vessels; such a facility is relatively rare within a\u000d\u000a      Chemistry department. Furthermore, the control and understanding of the\u000d\u000a      polymorphic state of the molecule was a regulatory and key component in\u000d\u000a      the successful use of methylene blue as a drug [1].\u000d\u000a    Early in the project (2003) it became apparent that for TauRx\u000d\u000a      Pharmaceuticals to develop a convincing market position and accrue more\u000d\u000a      value, second generation compounds would also be required. A large number\u000d\u000a      of previously unreported molecules have been prepared which have resulted\u000d\u000a      in a significant patent portfolio [2]. Four of the drug candidates\u000d\u000a      developed have moved into phase 1 preclinical toxicological studies and\u000d\u000a      have already been assessed using a number of highly discriminating animal\u000d\u000a      models. One of these molecules has been fast-tracked through phase one\u000d\u000a      bioequivalence studies and escalating dose \/ tolerability studies in\u000d\u000a      humans. The design of this molecule centred upon developing a stable\u000d\u000a      reduced form of the methylthioninium moiety (methylene white or\u000d\u000a      leuco-methylene blue). The rationale behind this approach was to provide\u000d\u000a      the molecule in a form with greater tolerability, due to fewer haemolytic\u000d\u000a      and other undesirable side effects [3]. In addition, due to higher\u000d\u000a      solubility and other desirable attributes, a far improved pharmacokinetic\u000d\u000a      profile has been obtained [4]. This molecule has been approved worldwide\u000d\u000a      for two large international phase III clinical trials with 1,500 patients\u000d\u000a      which started in November 2012, and a third phase II\/III clinical trial in\u000d\u000a      fronto-temporal dementia.\u000d\u000a    Given the very poor diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in its early stages\u000d\u000a      based upon standard medical examination, and to complement the development\u000d\u000a      of treatments within the group, the parallel development of a molecular\u000d\u000a      imaging agent for early and accurate diagnosis was considered important.\u000d\u000a      This has involved the synthesis of a wide range of novel heterocyclic\u000d\u000a      systems that contain tracers such that they can be used for MRI or PET\u000d\u000a      visualisation. Progress on this project has been good, with a number of\u000d\u000a      compound classes being identified and tested with one patent filed to date\u000d\u000a      [5]. In order to progress this project it became apparent that\u000d\u000a      collaboration with an industrial partner with radio labelling capabilities\u000d\u000a      and imaging technology would be advantageous. To this end a collaboration\u000d\u000a      with the leading diagnostic imaging group for AD in the world\u000d\u000a      (Bayer-Schering, Berlin) has been established. This collaboration involves\u000d\u000a      chemical discovery, ligand design and labelling methodology being\u000d\u000a      undertaken in the Chemistry department in Aberdeen, and the \"hot\"\u000d\u000a      labelling and animal \/ human imaging taking place in Berlin. The funding\u000d\u000a      for this collaboration has largely come from Bayer-Schering (&#163;405K per\u000d\u000a      annum) but the outcome of this research will result in joint income for\u000d\u000a      both discovery parties.\u000d\u000a    Whilst the development of compounds has been a central theme throughout\u000d\u000a      all the chemistry effort, analysis has played a very important role; both\u000d\u000a      for molecules synthesised, and also when these molecules are tested in\u000d\u000a      animals and\/or humans. Analysis of biological samples is demanding, and\u000d\u000a      new methodology and protocols have been developed, validated and the data\u000d\u000a      obtained used in support of regulatory submissions for clinical trial\u000d\u000a      approvals worldwide. To achieve these outcomes GLP, GCP and GMP\u000d\u000a      laboratories have been set up and accredited by the MHRA in Aberdeen and\u000d\u000a      inspected on three occasions, the only chemistry department in the UK\u000d\u000a      boasting all three accredited analytical laboratories within a university.\u000d\u000a    All Chemistry research activities have taken place in, or have been\u000d\u000a      directed from, the Chemistry Department at the University of Aberdeen, led\u000d\u000a      by Professor John Storey, who joined the University of Aberdeen in 2001,\u000d\u000a      and was promoted to Professor in 2010.

In parallel, Chinese Import Regulations (a) had\u000a      also been revised to\u000a      establish a maximum permissible level of arsenic in grain that could be\u000a      imported. This Chinese\u000a      hygiene regulation established, for the first time, not only a level for\u000a      total arsenic, but also for\u000a      inorganic arsenic in different grain types including rice (0.15 mg\/kg)\u000a      thereby acknowledging the\u000a      different toxicity of the different molecular forms of arsenic in\u000a      foodstuffs. No impact was witnessed\u000a      at that time, however, on the regulatory levels of either the EU or the\u000a      UK. Subsequent research in\u000a      Aberdeen discovered that US rice has high levels of arsenic due to the use\u000a      of arsenic containing\u000a      herbicides on what were cotton fields but later converted in the Central\u000a      Mid-West to rice fields. The\u000a      extremely high arsenic prevalent in Bangladeshi rice grown in the dry\u000a      season was due to irrigation\u000a      using water containing arsenic; and that while rice accumulates large\u000a      levels of arsenic, wheat or\u000a      barley does not because rice is grown in flooded paddy soil, in which a\u000a      different mobile form of\u000a      arsenic occurs which is more easily taken up by the plant.\u000a    Subsequently, and as a result of the Chinese regulation, rice-based\u000a      consumer products\u000a      were analysed in Aberdeen, and it was found that most did not meet the\u000a      Chinese standard. This\u000a      triggered a study by the UK-Food Standard Agency (FSA) to conduct a study\u000a      on rice-based drinks.\u000a      Since the average rice milk had higher levels of inorganic arsenic than\u000a      would be allowed for\u000a      drinking water, public advice was issued in 2009 that children under 4\u000a      should not drink rice milk (b).\u000a      So called \"health foods\" such as bran, analysed in Aberdeen, also showed\u000a      elevated levels of\u000a      arsenic. When the levels of inorganic arsenic in the consumer products\u000a      were combined both with\u000a      consumption data and with the toxicological assessments developed by the\u000a      US-EPA for arsenic in\u000a      water, the predicted excess cancer cases from eating rice were modelled.\u000a      All exceeded the 1 case\u000a      in 10,000 often used as a benchmark for an acceptable level of a\u000a      contaminant in food. As a result\u000a      the FSA began to support Aberdeen's research (see grants listed in section\u000a      3). We investigated\u000a      how the preparation of the rice has an influence on both the toxic form of\u000a      the arsenic, and its\u000a      amount (A). However it was only when the results of an analysis of\u000a      baby-rice formula were\u000a      published (5), which found that a significant number of products (35%)\u000a      from the market did not\u000a      pass the Chinese regulatory limit that European regulatory authorities\u000a      began to pay attention. At\u000a      this point (2009) an expert group of regulators, toxicologists and food\u000a      scientists were contracted by\u000a      the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to develop a scientific opinion\u000a      paper related to levels\u000a      of arsenic in foodstuffs, and whether there was scope to regulate it (c).\u000a      This EFSA paper\u000a      highlighted seaweeds and other marine foods, but principally the concern\u000a      was about arsenic, and\u000a      in particular inorganic arsenic, in rice and rice-based products. They\u000a      concluded that there was\u000a      insufficient data available regarding inorganic arsenic in foodstuffs. The\u000a      authorities in their surveys\u000a      only consider the total arsenic content, instead of identifying the\u000a      specific molecular form of arsenic\u000a      that is known to be a carcinogen, and only 2% of data contains the latter\u000a      information. Hence, there\u000a      was a pressing need to show that a robust analytical method existed to\u000a      determine levels of\u000a      inorganic arsenic in rice and rice-based products. Furthermore, it was\u000a      noted at the FAO\/WHO Joint\u000a      Standard Program (2011) \"... that more accurate information on the\u000a        inorganic arsenic content of\u000a        foods as they are consumed is needed to improve assessments of dietary\u000a        exposures of inorganic\u000a        arsenic species. Analytical constraints to achieving this goal include\u000a        the lack of validated methods\u000a        for selective determination of inorganic arsenic species in food\u000a        matrices and the lack of certified\u000a        reference materials for inorganic arsenic in foods. The proportion of\u000a        inorganic arsenic in some\u000a        foods was found to vary widely, indicating that dietary exposures to\u000a        inorganic arsenic should be\u000a        based on actual data rather than using generalized conversion factors\u000a        from total arsenic\u000a        measurements\" (d).\u000a    Parallel to these developments Feldmann had been invited to join a\u000a      discussion group in\u000a      2006 at the EU-JRC, IRMM (Institute of Materials &amp; Measurements) to\u000a      discuss how the lack of\u000a      arsenic speciation data on consumer products could be alleviated These\u000a      discussions resulted in\u000a      the organisation of a world-wide proficiency testing (PT) (e) and the\u000a      development of rice as\u000a      reference material (g) in which inorganic arsenic was certified for the\u000a      first time. The Aberdeen\u000a      researchers surveyed arsenic speciation in different rice products in the\u000a      EU, provided a rice flour\u000a      material, and studied the stability of a homogenised sample which could be\u000a      sent out for worldwide\u000a      PT to more than hundred laboratories to provide information about the\u000a      concentration of arsenic and\u000a      inorganic arsenic in this rice flour. Not only was Feldmann's group chosen\u000a      to provide the rice\u000a      samples, it was also one of the five expert laboratories to identify the\u000a      \"true\" value, and provide data\u000a      for the stability and homogeneity of the arsenic and arsenic speciation of\u000a      the rice sample. Overall\u000a      the proficiency testing was extremely successful, the analytical community\u000a      demonstrating that\u000a      more than 75% of the laboratories were able to analyse rice within an\u000a      acceptable level (e). This led\u000a      to the decision that the introduction of a maximum regulatory level of\u000a      inorganic arsenic in rice\u000a      should not be postponed due to concerns over constraints or validation of\u000a      the analytical chemistry.\u000a    As a result, in 2012 the Joint (FAO\/WHO) Food Standard Program with the\u000a      Codex\u000a      Committee for Contaminants in Foods tabled in their sixth session (26-30\u000a      March) a proposed draft\u000a      maximum level of arsenic in rice and the Food and Drug Administration\u000a      released their preliminary\u000a      data of rice and rice based products (g).\u000a    In parallel Aberdeen worked together with the EU-JRC-IRMM to generate a\u000a      rice flour reference\u000a      material in which not only total arsenic but also its molecular forms\u000a      especially the inorganic arsenic\u000a      were certified. We provided the material and worked as the expert\u000a      laboratory on the certification\u000a      process. The process was successful and the material was released on 28th\u000a      January 2013 (f) in\u000a      which for the first time the molecular forms of arsenic were certified.\u000a      This guarantees that sufficient\u000a      high quality and transparent data for inorganic arsenic in rice and\u000a      rice-based products will be\u000a      produced over the next year to provide confidence for agreement on a\u000a      maximum level of inorganic\u000a      arsenic in rice and rice based product at the EU level and worldwide under\u000a      the leadership of FAO\u000a      of the UN and the WHO (h).\u000a    Claimed impact includes evidence of enhancement of the quality of data\u000a      for contaminants\u000a      in consumer products by the development of an analytical method and\u000a      fostering a general\u000a      acceptance of analytical methods for the carcinogenic chemical form of\u000a      arsenic in foodstuff; public\u000a      health and well-being has improved; and dietary guidelines have changed.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes how basic research to develop analytical\u000a      methodologies for\u000a      measuring inorganic arsenic in food, and its subsequent application to\u000a      rice and rice-based food\u000a      commodities, led directly to proposals to establish global agreements\u000a      describing the maximum\u000a      permissible level of a class I carcinogen, inorganic arsenic, in rice.

All of the arsenic in water is\u000a      inorganic, and its concentration is\u000a      strictly regulated. Since the 1990s, the WHO, the European Union (EU), and\u000a      the competent\u000a      authorities in the USA have established a maximum permissible level of\u000a      inorganic arsenic in\u000a      drinking water of 0.01mg\/l.\u000a    The environmental analytical chemistry group at the University of\u000a      Aberdeen, led by\u000a      Feldmann since 2003 (s), has worked for many years on the molecular forms\u000a      of toxic elements in\u000a      food, including arsenic. The concentration levels of arsenic in different\u000a      food commodities are\u000a      hugely variable. It was well known that seaweed used in Far East cuisine\u000a      had the highest\u000a      concentrations of arsenic, up to a factor 100 times higher than the levels\u000a      permitted by UK\u000a      legislation dating back to 1959 of 1.0 mg\/kg. EU regulations are typically\u000a      more onerous than\u000a      national food policies, and as a result national legislation has long been\u000a      subordinated to EU\u000a      regulation levels although in the case of arsenic, these have never been\u000a      established. In short, no\u000a      maximum level for arsenic in foodstuffs exists. The reason behind this is\u000a      that arsenic can occur in\u000a      foodstuffs in different molecular forms, of which one organoarsenical\u000a      (arsenobetaine) has been\u000a      established to be benign while others, such as arsenosugars, are\u000a      considered to be less toxic than\u000a      inorganic arsenic. Hence introducing a legal limit has been more complex\u000a      than stating a simple\u000a      arsenic concentration level permissible in food commodities, and\u000a      consequently, no levels were\u000a      established for foodstuffs by organisations such as the WHO.\u000a    The research undertaken in Aberdeen focussed initially on determining the\u000a      molecular forms\u000a      in seaweeds, and studied how these are metabolised by mammals. In the\u000a      first stage (1) a group of\u000a      sheep was identified which roam the shoreline of the island North\u000a      Ronaldsay in Orkney and whose\u000a      only source of food is seaweed. Analytical methodologies were developed to\u000a      determine the\u000a      molecular forms of arsenic in the seaweed, and how these are metabolised\u000a      by the sheep. Novel\u000a      arrangements of analytical instrumentation were established by combining\u000a      online liquid\u000a      chromatography with arsenic-specific detectors (an elemental (ICP-MS) and\u000a      molecular mass\u000a      spectrometry (ESI-MS). This hyphenation of mass spectrometers was the\u000a      first of its kind and\u000a      permitted the unambiguous determination of the molecular forms in complex\u000a      matrices such as\u000a      seaweed and urine (2). However, seaweed is not a major food commodity, and\u000a      although extremely\u000a      high concentrations of arsenic were identified, very little is in the form\u000a      of inorganic arsenic, the\u000a      class I carcinogen. Hence new analytical methods were developed which\u000a      allowed the study of rice,\u000a      a food commodity with lower arsenic concentration but consumed in large\u000a      amounts. The reason for\u000a      selecting rice was that it had been shown previously that the drinking\u000a      water in shallow wells in\u000a      Bangladesh contained significant levels of arsenic to which more than 60\u000a      million people are\u000a      exposed. In collaboration with the group of Professor Meharg (School of\u000a      Biological Sciences,\u000a      University of Aberdeen) greenhouse-based experiments were designed to\u000a      study how the irrigation\u000a      of arsenic elevated groundwater would influence the arsenic concentration\u000a      in rice (Abedin et al.\u000a      ES&amp;T 2002). Although the arsenic was two orders of magnitude lower in\u000a      concentration in\u000a      comparison to seaweed, a large proportion of the arsenic was in the\u000a      inorganic form.\u000a    These initial findings provided impetus for further studies, resulting in\u000a      the first paper to\u000a      consider arsenic speciation (the identification of the chemical form of\u000a      arsenic) in rice in a global\u000a      context (3). The findings concluded that arsenic levels in rice produced\u000a      in the USA were much\u000a      higher than in rice from India and Bangladesh and most of the arsenic was\u000a      in the form of inorganic\u000a      arsenic. This work was published in 2005 and attracted not only specialist\u000a      attention from food\u000a      groups and the American Rice Federation, but also generated very\u000a      considerable public awareness\u000a      of the issue. The American Rice Federation accused the research team of\u000a      bad science (Press\u000a      Release USA Today) although the findings were later supported following\u000a      confirmation by research\u000a      on behalf of the US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA). The Aberdeen\u000a      paper (3) also\u000a      became the most influential paper related to the research on levels of\u000a      arsenic in rice, cited 251\u000a      times to date(international recognition being identified by Thomson\u000a      Reuters, Essential Science\u000a        Indicators, November 2009: as the most cited paper in the fast\u000a      moving area of \"arsenic\u000a      speciation\"). This was followed up by a world-wide survey of polished\u000a      white rice (4) which showed\u000a      that high-rice consumption in regions with high arsenic in rice revealed\u000a      elevated cancer risks based\u000a      on cancer risk models from US-EPA using inorganic arsenic as the\u000a      contaminant. Application of the\u000a      same methods to rice-based products led to the identification of high\u000a      levels of inorganic arsenic in\u000a      baby rice (5) and rice milk (6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43307","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the research undertaken at Aberdeen relates to\u000a      practitioners and professional\u000a      services, where professional and industry standards have been informed as\u000a      a result of research\u000a      findings. As stated by Professor R. D. Hooton, a world-leading contributor\u000a      to the cement and\u000a      construction industry in Canada: \"... the Chemistry Department at the\u000a        University of Aberdeen has\u000a        made the biggest contributions globally to our understanding of both\u000a        hydration of cements and\u000a        fundamental understanding of durability of cementitious materials for\u000a        use in concrete\" [a].\u000a    The key outcome of the particular research project as described was to\u000a      inform\u000a      international standards beyond the EU. As verified by the Portland Cement\u000a      Association, the\u000a      industry trade association for North America, \"in the last several\u000a        years, the US cement industry has\u000a        made significant progress in its continuing efforts to improve the\u000a        sustainability of the built\u000a        environment, and a key component of that effort has been the development\u000a        of specification\u000a        requirements for Portland-limestone cements. After several years'\u000a        effort, in 2012, US blended\u000a        cement specifications were revised to include cements with up to 15%\u000a        limestone. While other\u000a        research has gone into this effort, a key component of the rationale\u000a        supporting changes to both\u000a        sets of specifications was results of your (Glasser) research related to\u000a        the reactions that limestone\u000a        undergoes during cement hydration, their volumetric changes, and the\u000a        thermodynamic stability of\u000a        the resulting phases. We continue to use the results of this research in\u000a        the on-going educational\u000a        efforts with specifiers, architects and engineers...\" [b]. Dr\u000a      Kosmatka further clarifies the overall\u000a      economic impact implied by the benefits derived from this research: \"It\u000a        is difficult to estimate the\u000a        economic impact of these changes for the concrete construction industry\u000a        in the US. A roughly 10%\u000a        saving with regard to CO2 and other emissions\u000a        and energy has made the industry more efficient as\u000a        well as more sustainable, both of which help the competitiveness in the\u000a        roughly $19 billion (US)\u000a        cement industry\" [b].\u000a    The impact of Glasser's work on the North American cement industry is\u000a      further\u000a      supported by Al Innis, Vice President of Holcim (US), who states \"...The\u000a        work you have done on\u000a        limestone cements has been a key component in having the US standards\u000a        accept blended\u000a        cements containing up to 15% limestone. This change in standards gives\u000a        our industry and Holcim\u000a        (US) in particular the opportunity to provide our customers a higher\u000a        quality product with a lower\u000a        carbon footprint...\" [c].\u000a    In addition, to confirmation of new standards in the USA, specifications\u000a      in Canada\u000a      have also been developed. As Professor Hooton confirms: \"The work by\u000a        Matschei, Lothenbach\u000a        and Glasser has been important for the understanding of\u000a        Portland-limestone cements that led to\u000a        their adoption in cement specifications in Canada (CSA A3000) in 2008\u000a        and in the USA (ASTCM\u000a        C595) in 2012. The use of these cements is now incorporated into the\u000a        Canadian building codes,\u000a        and their use is increasing\" [a].\u000a    Limestone addition to cement contributes to properties through three\u000a      mechanisms:\u000a      particle packing effects which reduce water demand, nucleation effects\u000a      which accelerate hydration\u000a      reactions, and production of carboaluminate phases which reduce porosity.\u000a      According to a 2011\u000a      State of the Art Report from the Portland Cement Association, Glasser's\u000a      work \"provided\u000a        quantitative calculation of the phases that may be present...... a great\u000a        step forward in\u000a        understanding these systems\" [d]\u000a    The thermodynamic models derived from the research have now been\u000a      incorporated\u000a      into the GEMS suite (Gibbs Energy\u000a      Minimization Software for\u000a        Geochemical Modelling), originally\u000a      developed by the Swiss Nuclear Organisation, and now managed by the Paul\u000a      Scherrer Institute.\u000a      Explicitly the research work has been fundamental to the CEMDATA07\u000a      database, included in the\u000a      GEMS TDB software package (GEMS Thermodynamic\u000a      DataBase) [e]. Empa, who\u000a      co-supervised\u000a      the research project, confirm that the Aberdeen research was a fundamental\u000a      component to the\u000a      cement database \"was published in 2007-2009 and based on work carried\u000a        out at Empa\u000a        (Lothenbach et al., 2008; M&#246;schner et al. 2008, 2009; Schmidt et al.\u000a        2008) and a PhD carried out\u000a      both at the University of Aberdeen and at Empa (Matschei et al, 2008)\"\u000a      [f].\u000a    In overall terms, the economic benefit is hard to calculate, although the\u000a      saving in\u000a      CO2 emissions is more straightforward. The world production of\u000a      Portland cement is about 3 x109\u000a      tonnes per year. If one third of this production uses 10% limestone\u000a      replacement, and assuming\u000a      production in efficient equipment, the net saving in CO2\u000a      emissions is of the order of 85 million\u000a      tonnes per year. From this has to be deducted the energy input of\u000a      quarrying and grinding\u000a      limestone, but this is comparatively low (only a few million tonnes per\u000a      year), Thus a reduction of\u000a      the order of 80 million tonnes per year carbon dioxide emission is\u000a      achieved, with considerable\u000a      scope for greater reductions still realisable as the process continues to\u000a      gain traction.\u000a    The International Energy Agency (IEA) has proposed strategies to reduce\u000a      global\u000a      CO2 emissions by 52% from 2007 to 2050 [g]. The so-called Blue\u000a      Map Scenario places different\u000a      requirements on different sectors of the global economy. The cement\u000a      industry is required to reduce\u000a      its CO2 emissions by 22.5% from 2007 to 2050. Limestone\u000a      substitution in Portland cement at levels\u000a      now shown by this work to be safe and reliable will achieve around 1\/6th\u000a      of the 450 million tonnes\u000a      per year reduction in CO2 emissions required.\u000a    Furthermore, the success of this project has led to financial support for\u000a      bolder and\u000a      more radical initiatives for reducing CO2 emissions from the\u000a      cement industry.

A\u000a      former student of the late J.D. Bernal FRS, Taylor took inspiration from\u000a      Bernal's polymath\u000a      approach to science and by demonstrating the application of crystal\u000a      chemistry and structure to the\u000a      hydration of cement, gave the subject new directions. Since Taylor's\u000a      retirement about 1985 this\u000a      work has been progressed by F.P. Glasser and D.E. Macphee. The importance\u000a      of the work to\u000a      science and industry has been recognised by (i) major research projects\u000a      from the UK Environment\u000a      Agency (at that time, HMIP and DoE) and the European Union, having as its\u000a      objective providing a\u000a      scientific basis for the immobilisation of nuclear waste in cement. This\u000a      work is frequently cited\u000a      today and forms an integral part of the safety case worldwide for\u000a      radioactive waste immobilisation.\u000a    The specific example of more recent work which has influenced industry\u000a      and which forms the basis\u000a      of this Case Study relates to the use of limestone (calcium carbonate) as\u000a      a reactive supplement for\u000a      Portland cement. Since the 1970's, the cement industry has come under\u000a      increasing pressure to\u000a      reduce its carbon dioxide emissions: one tonne of Portland cement is\u000a      responsible for emission of\u000a      ~850kg CO2 even with the best available abatement technology.\u000a      By 1990 it was accepted on the\u000a      basis of empirical evidence that adding c. 4-6% limestone to cement\u000a      improved its strength and\u000a      decreased product permeability. Up to 10-12% limestone by volume could be\u000a      added without\u000a      reducing properties to below those of equivalent mixes with 100% cement.\u000a      The problem was that\u000a      the evidence was statistical with a reasonable but not totally convincing\u000a      probability. And it was\u000a      insufficient to convince many sceptics of the need for change in an\u000a      industry dominated by\u000a      prescriptive specifications. Nevertheless, since limestone addition to\u000a      cement reduces CO2\u000a      emissions due to cement production (discounting the small energy cost of\u000a      limestone production),\u000a      the drive for the industry to reduce its CO2 emissions meant\u000a      that more convincing evidence for the\u000a      value of limestone addition was needed.\u000a    In 2004 the Glasser group in Aberdeen began a research project dedicated\u000a      to application of\u000a      thermodynamics to cement hydration. The group had done pioneering work on\u000a      the role of calcium\u000a      carbonate in the hydration process [1]. However the lack of a good\u000a      database meant that\u000a      predictions were only semi- quantitative and only a coarse grid of\u000a      relevant systems could be\u000a      calculated. In 2003 Glasser successfully applied to Nanocem (a\u000a      not-for-profit consortium financed\u000a      by the European cement industry) to sponsor a project aimed at improving\u000a      and applying a\u000a      database for cementitious substances. As a demonstration example of the\u000a      power of the new\u000a      database and modern computation methods, calculations were undertaken and\u000a      subsequently\u000a      verified by targeted experiments, on phase relations in the CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-\u000a      CaCO3-CaSO4-H2O\u000a      system at 0-85&#186;C. It was highly relevant because the benefit, if any, of\u000a      adding limestone to cement\u000a      was being hotly debated at the time.\u000a    The calculations showed that the amount of CaCO3 which could\u000a      react with cement at a particular\u000a      temperature was quantitatively related to the Al2O3\/sulphate\u000a      molar ratio of the cement. Diagrams\u000a      were devised allowing the optimum amount of reactive carbonate to be\u000a      predicted from a two-dimensional\u000a      plot requiring as input compositional data obtained from elemental\u000a      analysis of the\u000a      cement. Experimentally, it was shown that the predicted equilibria were\u000a      attained within a few days.\u000a      This work was first reported at a conference [2] and in an industrial\u000a      journal [3], which presented the\u000a      results and explained the basis of the calculation without thermodynamic\u000a      details, in a manner\u000a      accessible to engineers and stakeholders. Two full papers in the journal\u000a      Cement and Concrete\u000a      Research then presented the details of the thermodynamic modelling [4, 5].\u000a      A subsequent paper\u000a      has extended the modelling to include temperature dependence [6].\u000a    The key outcome of this work is that the addition of CaCO3 can\u000a      be optimised on a generic basis so\u000a      as to shift most of the sulphate into ettringite, a low density calcium\u000a      sulphoaluminate hydrate. This\u000a      maximises conversion of liquid water to crystal water, thereby also\u000a      optimising space filling by solids\u000a      and reducing cement matrix porosity. This enables a win-win situation to\u000a      be attained: reducing\u000a      clinker contents, with their high CO2 liberation, and also\u000a      improving product durability in a wide\u000a      range of aggressive service environments.\u000a    Such modification of the hydrate phase assemblage has mainly been used in\u000a      the cement industry\u000a      to maximise CO2 reduction by increasing substitution of cement\u000a      by limestone, while maintaining\u000a      engineering properties such as strength and porosity, to those which would\u000a      be obtained in cement-only\u000a      formulations. This has led the industry to rely less on empiricism and\u000a      more on science-based\u000a      approaches to improve cement properties and reduce emissions.\u000a      Thermodynamic treatments are\u000a      now routinely being extended to optimise production parameters at the\u000a      hydration stage.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43402","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A spin out company has been established and a new technology sector\u000a        has been created: There is a clear link between research at\u000a      Loughborough University in electrochemistry and methane and hydrogen-based\u000a      fuel cell power sources.

This led to\u000a      the construction of the first 1 kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell in\u000a      1995, when the spin out company Advanced Power Sources Limited (APS) was\u000a      formed to work on the pre-commercial development of prototype fuel cells.\u000a      Intelligent Energy was formed in 2001 to acquire APS and attract private\u000a      capital investment. Initially a 25 person strong company based in\u000a      Loughborough and London offices, it secured an irrevocable, worldwide\u000a      license to exploit all of both APS's and the University group's fuel cell\u000a      related IP. Key research staff from Loughborough University were involved\u000a      in setting up both companies, including Dr Phil Mitchell and Dr Paul\u000a      Adcock. Dr Mitchell, a lecturer in the Department of Chemistry at the\u000a      beginning of the project, is now Chief Technology Officer and Executive\u000a      Director of Intelligent Energy, is an electrochemist with over 20 years of\u000a      experience in fuel cell and related fields who obtained his BSc and PhD at\u000a      Loughborough University and was a co-leader of fuel cell research at\u000a      Loughborough University. Dr Adcock is Director of Research and Technology,\u000a      heading up teams at Intelligent Energy developing PEM (proton exchange\u000a      membrane) fuel cell stacks and systems, and was also part of the Fuel Cell\u000a      Group at Loughborough University. Additionally, Jon Moore was a researcher\u000a      in the Chemistry Department during this period. He contributed to key\u000a      research findings, and is now the Communications Director for Intelligent\u000a      Energy.\u000a    The research carried out at Loughborough University contributed directly\u000a      to knowledge in the area of fuel cell development at the time. These\u000a      studies were carried out and published in the period 1997-2001. Operating\u000a      pressure has a direct effect on fuel stack efficiency since it increases\u000a      the cell potential. Research at Loughborough showed that a 33% efficiency\u000a      gain was achieved at an operating pressure of 4 bar [3.1]. Solid\u000a      polymer fuel cells are suitable sources for short duration, high power\u000a      pulses, but this requires the cell design, component materials and\u000a      membrane assemblies to be tested. Loughborough research showed that best\u000a      performance was achieved with low equivalent weight, thin membranes with\u000a      high catalyst utilization and optimized flow designs [3.2]. This\u000a      also required new techniques for the fabrication of the electrodes [3.3]\u000a      The effects of contamination of the fuel cell were assessed for common\u000a      pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulfur monoxide, nitrogen dioxide,\u000a      hydrocarbons, as well as chemical weapons that may be present in a\u000a      battlefield environment [3.4]. At normal concentrations, little\u000a      effect was found for the first class of contaminants, but the chemical\u000a      weapons class had serious effect on performance. These studies were\u000a      carried out in the period 1995-2001. The research also discovered advanced\u000a      humidification techniques that obviate the need for external\u000a      humidification, a major saving in space and weight for the fuel cell\u000a      system package; an extremely important factor in transportation\u000a      applications in 2000.[3.5]\u000a    The papers [3.1-3.4] are in peer reviewed journals or invited\u000a      contributions and [3.5] is an international patent. This meets the\u000a      requirement that the underpinning research is at least of 2* quality. In\u000a      addition, the underpinning grant income outlined below, which led to these\u000a      papers was peer reviewed in competitive responsive mode.\u000a    Key researchers for LU contributing to this project were: Dr. Phil\u000a      Mitchell (PhD and lecturer 1980 until 1998, now Chief Technology Officer\u000a      at IE), Dr Paul Adcock (PhD and Senior Lecturer 1984 until 2001, now\u000a      Director of Research at IE), Dr. Jon Moore (PhD and Research Associate\u000a      1992 until 2001, now Communications Director at IE), Dr. Simon Foster (PhD\u000a      and Research Associate 1993 until 1995, now Technology Specialist at IE),\u000a      Dr. Chris Dudfield (PhD and Research Associate 1993 until 2001, now\u000a      Technical Director: Corporate Development at IE)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43428","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research directly resulted in changes in UK government policy and\u000d\u000a      improved forecasts of air quality made available to the public. In the UK,\u000d\u000a      air pollutants reduce lifespan on average by 8-14 months, and by up to 9\u000d\u000a      years for the most vulnerable groupings, inducing respiratory and\u000d\u000a      pulmonary diseases that affect disproportionately the elderly and\u000d\u000a      children. Health costs are estimated to be &#163;10.7 billion per annum5\u000d\u000a      and are comparable to those of alcohol and drug misuse. Vulnerable people\u000d\u000a      are advised to consult air quality forecasts, as illustrated by the Met\u000d\u000a      Office and Asthma Society:6 \"If you find pollution triggers\u000d\u000a        your asthma, keep well informed about air quality. Ozone can be a\u000d\u000a        problem for some people. Levels are likely to be higher on hot summer\u000d\u000a        days.\" Air pollution also causes ecological damage and reduces crop\u000d\u000a      yields. The connection between heat-waves and air pollution and their\u000d\u000a      impacts on the population reached wide attention during summer 2003, a\u000d\u000a      period that led to several thousand additional deaths throughout Europe\u000d\u000a      attributable to ozone and fine particulates.7 The event\u000d\u000a      catalysed public debate on the effects of air pollution, the possible\u000d\u000a      impacts of a warmer climate and the effectiveness of Government policy for\u000d\u000a      pollution control. In response, DEFRA collaborated with the York team to\u000d\u000a      improve their capability for prediction of air quality. This collaboration\u000d\u000a      began in 2003 and continues, most recently during the heat-wave of July\u000d\u000a      2013.\u000d\u000a    The government has benefited from clear scientific evidence for the\u000d\u000a      causes of continuing peak summertime ozone pollution, and an enhanced\u000d\u000a      appreciation of the limitations of EU control policies in periods of high\u000d\u000a      temperatures. The inclusion of biogenic species in predictive models has\u000d\u000a      provided government with an improved capability to forecast air quality in\u000d\u000a      the short term,8 and provided advice to the public (for example\u000d\u000a      through DEFRA and Met Office air quality forecasts). It has also improved\u000d\u000a      estimates of future changes in air pollution of natural origin and those\u000d\u000a      arising through policy change. There is now a better appreciation of the\u000d\u000a      balance between the effects of natural and man-made emissions on air\u000d\u000a      quality. Since controlling anthropogenic emissions is a costly activity,\u000d\u000a      the benefits of improved prediction are felt in both health and financial\u000d\u000a      domains.\u000d\u000a    Section 2 presented the finding from York that biogenic volatile organic\u000d\u000a      compounds are released in large quantities from vegetation in the UK on\u000d\u000a      hot summer days, promoting rapid photochemical formation of ozone. The\u000d\u000a      natural emissions offset some of the benefits from policies to reduce man-\u000d\u000a      made VOCs from sources such as combustion and solvent usage. York\u000d\u000a      scientists calculated the impacts of biogenics on air quality using their\u000d\u000a      unique measurements and supporting data from other HEIs.\u000d\u000a    The research data collected by York were shared within months with the\u000d\u000a      evidence team at DEFRA, the Government department responsible for ensuring\u000d\u000a      UK compliance with European legislation, and specifically the air quality\u000d\u000a      Directive 2008\/50\/EC. At the same time there was substantial media\u000d\u000a      reporting and debate about the research.9 Peer-reviewed\u000d\u000a      publications from York followed in 2005 and 2006.2,3 These\u000d\u000a      academic publications were then used by DEFRA as a key part of the\u000d\u000a      evidence base that guided the terms of reference for two Government\u000d\u000a      reports. It is through these reports published in 2008 and 2009, and\u000d\u000a      on-going policy recommendations and practice changes, that the impacts of\u000d\u000a      the research in this assessment period are seen.\u000d\u000a    The first DEFRA expert report on the impacts of climate change on air\u000d\u000a      pollution appeared in 200810 and a second reporting on ozone in\u000d\u000a      the UK appeared in 2009.11 In addition, DEFRA called an expert\u000d\u000a      meeting in 2009.12 Both reports made substantial reference to\u000d\u000a      the original underpinning research, highlighting the impacts that this new\u000d\u000a      understanding of natural emissions may have on air quality, and how\u000d\u000a      climate change may exacerbate this process.\" The drought conditions\u000d\u000a        accompanying the episode (summer 2003) decreased deposition of ozone to\u000d\u000a        vegetation, while the high temperatures led to increased emissions of\u000d\u000a        isoprene, a highly reactive volatile organic compound that is emitted\u000d\u000a        from vegetation, and is an ozone precursor. Both of these effects\u000d\u000a        further contributed to the high ozone concentrations.\" 10\u000d\u000a      Both Government reports made reference to the need to improve the\u000d\u000a      representation of biogenic species in UK emissions models in the light of\u000d\u000a      the York research. In 2010, DEFRA tendered for an update of the reporting\u000d\u000a      of natural VOC emissions for the UK, and the models used for national\u000d\u000a      policy development continue to be updated to include this source. This key\u000d\u000a      change to represent natural VOC emissions in the models used by Government\u000d\u000a      for future scenario testing has embedded the original research in all\u000d\u000a      future policy formulations. Specific direct consequences are: (a) DEFRA\u000d\u000a      contracted the consultancy Ricardo-AEA (http:\/\/www.ricardo-aea.com)\u000d\u000a      to include natural emissions in future air quality predictions, work that\u000d\u000a      is on-going; (b) the Met Office is including natural emissions in the\u000d\u000a      models used for their air-quality forecasts for the public (http:\/\/www.metoffice.gov.uk\/guide\/weather\/air-quality).\u000d\u000a    Activities supporting DEFRA air-quality evidence and policy requirements\u000d\u000a      continue to the present. Lewis is a current member of the Government\u000d\u000a      Expert Committee, the Air Quality Expert Group. DEFRA continues to support\u000d\u000a      a range of air pollution and emissions research projects at York Chemistry\u000d\u000a      with Lewis, Lee and Hamilton. In 2012, DEFRA and York created a new\u000d\u000a      permanent staff position split between Whitehall and York to accelerate\u000d\u000a      the translation of NERC air quality science outcomes into government\u000d\u000a      departments (Dr Sarah Moller).\u000d\u000a    Quotations: Dr Tim Murrells, Technical Director, National Atmospheric\u000d\u000a      Emissions Inventory, Ricardo-AEA (05\/04\/13) \"The research project\u000d\u000a        TORCH, led by Prof. Lewis at University of York, provided a very\u000d\u000a        detailed chemical analysis of processes occurring in the UK during very\u000d\u000a        high temperature conditions. The research, and later DEFRA expert\u000d\u000a        publications, highlighted that natural organic emissions of isoprene\u000d\u000a        could elevate UK ozone during very warm weather. In response, there is\u000d\u000a        now a programme of work, commissioned by DEFRA and led by Ricardo-AEA,\u000d\u000a        to provide recommendations on approaches for estimating biogenic\u000d\u000a        emissions inventories and their use in models to support air pollution\u000d\u000a        prediction and forecasting. Ricardo-AEA includes biogenic inventories in\u000d\u000a        its Ozone Source Receptor Model which is used to predict future ozone\u000d\u000a        concentrations in the UK and to inform DEFRA's policies on ozone air\u000d\u000a        quality by predicting the impacts of future changes in precursor\u000d\u000a        emissions. Ricardo-AEA also uses this information in models used for\u000d\u000a        DEFRA's daily forecasts and public alert systems on air pollution for\u000d\u000a        the protection of human health.\"13\u000d\u000a    Dr Chris Jones, Head, Earth System and Mitigation Science, Met Office\u000d\u000a      Hadley Centre (22\/04\/13): \"In part due to NERC-funded TORCH campaign,\u000d\u000a        the Met Office has developed global and regional chemistry climate\u000d\u000a        models which include detailed process-based representations of the\u000d\u000a        dependence of isoprene emissions on temperature and light levels.

It is a challenge to\u000d\u000a      determine how much ozone will form at a given time, since each VOC has a\u000d\u000a      different ozone-forming potential. We need therefore to know what types of\u000d\u000a      VOCs are present in air, and in what quantities. In 2003, NERC supported a\u000d\u000a      major experimental project1 led by Lewis (also including\u000d\u000a      Carpenter, Hamilton and Lee from York) to take state-of-the-art\u000d\u000a      measurement into the field in the UK to establish which organic compounds\u000d\u000a      were drivers of ozone formation. Other contributing universities were\u000d\u000a      Leeds, UEA, Manchester, Bristol and Imperial. The York team led the\u000d\u000a      consortium and made the measurements of organic emissions, while the other\u000d\u000a      universities provided supporting data. York led the data analysis.\u000d\u000a    Observations of all major VOC classes and other compounds were made\u000d\u000a      during summer 2003 as part of a large collaborative field experiment\u000d\u000a      during the most significant heat-wave for more than a decade. Ozone in SE\u000d\u000a      England exceeded 240 03bcg m-3 on some days, levels reminiscent\u000d\u000a      of the 1970s and early 1980s before the widespread use of catalytic\u000d\u000a      converters in vehicles. This was a highly unexpected level of air\u000d\u000a      pollution since European policy on emissions targets had been assumed to\u000d\u000a      have mitigated against very high ozone episodes. Using data from this\u000d\u000a      field study, the York group published papers in which they determined that\u000d\u000a      during the hottest periods, organic emissions (especially isoprene) from\u000d\u000a      plants rose dramatically leading to a natural contribution to the overall\u000d\u000a      atmospheric VOC loading, in turn Ozone levels during 2003 heat wave\u000d\u000a      generating additional smog which was not accounted for in predictive\u000d\u000a      forecasting models.2,3 This was an unexpected finding since the\u000d\u000a      UK was considered to have negligible isoprene emissions from its plant\u000d\u000a      stock. These publications highlighted for the first time the potential\u000d\u000a      direct impacts of a warmer climate on air quality in the UK and consequent\u000d\u000a      impacts on quality of life. The research models demonstrated the\u000d\u000a      inadequacy of accounting procedures for emissions used by UK government\u000d\u000a      since their methods did not include these natural organic emissions in a\u000d\u000a      representative way.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Key researchers\u000d\u000a      Alistair C.

The new\u000a        stratospheric lifetime contributed to the assessment that the problem is\u000a        due to unreported\u000a        emissions, rather than an erroneous lifetime.\u000a      The end product of the destruction of chlorinated gases in the\u000a        stratosphere and lower\u000a        mesosphere is HCl. Observations of HCl reduction in the lower mesosphere\u000a        by ACE contributed\u000a        to the overall assessment of the success of the Montreal Protocol in the\u000a        2010 report.6\u000a\u000a      In relation to natural brominated compounds, the research provided\u000a        emissions estimates,\u000a        hitherto unidentified species, and new understanding of the\u000a        halogen composition and chemistry\u000a        of the stratosphereand troposphere.3,4 The major\u000a        impact is that inclusion of such natural\u000a        bromine species and their chemistry in global models has led to better\u000a        agreement of the model\u000a        with inorganic bromine measurements in the stratosphere, as detailed in\u000a        the 2010 report.6 This\u000a        provides evidence that the policy is effective and improves the robust\u000a        prediction of the\u000a        timescales for ozone hole recovery.\u000a       \u000a      York impact &#8212; tropospheric ozone. Whilst the role of halogen\u000a        chemistry in controlling stratospheric\u000a        ozone has been well known for several decades, the impact on\u000a        tropospheric ozone has been less\u000a        understood. Ozone in the troposphere is important for several reasons;\u000a        it is an air pollutant, a\u000a        greenhouse gas in its own right, and indirectly it controls the lifetime\u000a        of methane, another important\u000a        greenhouse gas. The roles of both ozone and methane as greenhouse gases\u000a        are increasing in\u000a        importance. The new knowledge of halogen-tropospheric ozone processes\u000a        reported by the York\u000a        scientists4 has contributed to policy recommendations; the\u000a        Royal Society Ozone report (2009)7\u000a        used the research to highlight the need to understand and control\u000a        background ozone\u000a        concentrations in relation to air quality. The research was also\u000a        reported widely in the media and\u000a        led to public debate on the potential of natural processes to mitigate\u000a        against air pollution.8\u000a      The research programme4 has achieved long-term impacts\u000a        through the building of experimental\u000a        infrastructure. The proposal for a tropical ocean atmospheric\u000a        observatory was driven by Carpenter\u000a        (York) with Leeds colleagues and resulted in the construction of an\u000a        observatory in Cape Verde\u000a        (www.ncas.ac.uk\/cvao). The\u000a        research demonstrated the value of long-term monitoring of the\u000a        tropical atmosphere.4 As a result, the observatory is now\u000a        supported as a permanent UK\u000a        contribution to the World WMO Global Atmospheric Watch programme (www.wmo.int\/gaw);\u000a        it is\u000a        one of 28 stations worldwide and the only station supported by the UK\u000a        Government.

The 1987 Montreal Protocol\u000a      on substances that\u000a      deplete the ozone layer and its subsequent amendments have resulted in the\u000a      phasing-out of the\u000a      production of many such chlorine-and bromine-containing species &#8212;\u000a      preventing not only millions of\u000a      cases of skin cancer deaths and cataracts, but also reducing emissions of\u000a      halogenated\u000a      greenhouse gases by the equivalent of more than 10 billion tonnes of CO2\u000a      at the end of 2008. In\u000a      view of the steady progress made under the Protocol, former UN\u000a      Secretary-General Kofi Annan\u000a      called it in 2003 Perhaps the single most successful international\u000a        agreement to date\u000a      (ozone.unep.org\/Publications\/MP_Key_Achievements-E.pdf).\u000a    It is crucial to assess the performance of the Montreal Protocol in\u000a      reducing the concentrations of\u000a      ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and to monitor the recovery of the ozone\u000a      layer. Therefore,\u000a      every four years the WMO and UNEP publish a report on the ``Scientific\u000a      Assessment of Ozone\u000a      Depletion'', carried out by the Scientific Assessment Panel (SAP). The\u000a      York-based group, led by\u000a      Bernath, contributed to the WMO ozone report by measuring global\u000a      concentration distributions of\u000a      many chlorine-containing molecules using data from the ACE satellite1\u000a      (www.ace.uwaterloo.ca).\u000a    \u000a      UV photodissociation of these molecules forms intermediates such as\u000a        phosgene (Cl2CO) and\u000a        ClFCO 1,2 and leads ultimately to the formation of HCl. ACE\u000a        satellite measurements tested the\u000a        accuracy of chemical models and showed the anticipated decline in HCl\u000a        and other halogenated\u000a        gases due to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol.\u000a      Atmospheric lifetimes are crucial parameters in models and the\u000a        research group determined the\u000a        relative stratospheric lifetime of CCl4 by the method of\u000a        tracer-tracer correlations; there are\u000a        surprisingly large uncertainties in these lifetimes (see 2010 WMO ozone\u000a        report).\u000a      CCl4 is destroyed mainly by photolysis in the stratosphere\u000a        giving phosgene. Fu et al. measured\u000a        the first global distribution of phosgene2 and found that\u000a        concentrations had declined from earlier\u000a        in situ measurements owing to decline in the parent source gases\u000a        CH3CCl3 and CCl4.\u000a      The York group found that the global distribution of FClCO,1\u000a        produced by photolysis of the\u000a        parent CFC-11 (CF3Cl) molecule, agreed well with that\u000a        calculated by an atmospheric model,\u000a        giving confidence in the reliability of the emissions projections and\u000a        the model.\u000a    \u000a    Conventionally, it was thought that anthropogenic bromine compounds in\u000a      the form of halons and\u000a      CH3Br were the sole carriers of bromine into the stratosphere.\u000a      However, calculated stratospheric\u000a      Bry concentrations from measurements of BrO were too\u000a      high by 15-40% to be explained by these\u000a      halocarbons alone. The oceanic and atmospheric measurements of Carpenter\u000a      in York showed that\u000a      emissions of natural bromine compounds including CHBr3 and CH2Br2\u000a      from the marine biosphere,\u000a      especially macroalgae, represent a major global source of bromine.3\u000a      Subsequent model studies\u000a      showed that these emissions were sufficient to explain the discrepancy\u000a      between modelled and\u000a      measured stratospheric BrO concentrations. The York group demonstrated\u000a      that ozone in the\u000a      troposphere was also controlled over wide oceanic areas by natural halogen\u000a      emissions,4  and this\u000a      has led to public and policy debate on the potential contribution of such\u000a      processes to the reduction\u000a      of ground level ozone, a key pollutant (in contrast to the essential\u000a      nature of stratospheric ozone).\u000a    Both the ACE and the tropospheric research are part of multi-centre\u000a      programmes involving\u000a      collaboration of York with other institutes in Canada, USA, Belgium, UK,\u000a      Germany and France.\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a    Peter F.

The potential for mislabelling came to the fore in 2009 and\u000a      again in 2013. The Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA, an agency\u000a      of DEFRA close to York) guides the science evidence base in the food and\u000a      environment sectors to ensure that UK policy makers are well informed,\u000a      undertaking both surveillance and R&amp;D activities. Its services\u000a      underpin regulatory frameworks as well as supporting religious and\u000a      cultural factors such as food provenance (e.g. halal or kosher).\u000a      Five million people in the UK choose to avoid pig and cow products on\u000a      vegetarian or religious grounds; they include 2.7M Muslims and 817,000\u000a      Hindus.1\u000a    The standard method of identifying the species origin of meat is DNA\u000a      sequencing, but this is not possible on all samples (e.g. gelatin,\u000a      material that has been heated). Moreover, exogenous DNA can be added\u000a      fraudulently to mask endogenous signals. The York team of Collins and\u000a      Thomas-Oates was asked to use ZooMS and other proprietary mass\u000a      spectrometry approaches for collagen identification, to support a Food\u000a      Standards Agency investigation into the use of pig- and cow-derived\u000a      gelatin employed to re-hydrate air-freighted products in foods labelled as\u000a      containing only chicken (the addition of other animal protein to meat\u000a      stated to be from a single source is illegal). They were then approached\u000a      anonymously by an investigative team later revealed to be from the BBC, to\u000a      test chicken breasts supplied to Asian restaurants. As a result of the BBC\u000a      TV investigation (broadcast on 14\/07\/09, entitled `What's really in our\u000a      food?'), Euro Foods Group announced on their website (July 2009) that in\u000a      order to 'eradicate any future question marks and\/or confusion over\u000a      non-chicken protein detection levels in our product range, Euro Foods\u000a      Group has decided to switch to a vegetable derived protein instead, a move\u000a      which was completed by 29th June 2009' (see also minutes 51-52 of\u000a      programme in reference 2). Euro Foods (http:\/\/www.eurofoods.co.uk)\u000a      is the largest supplier of poultry to the Asian market in the UK. The\u000a      discovery of bovine gelatin in chicken was publicised in the UK press (The\u000a        Independent, The Daily Mail, and The Sun), and\u000a      featured in the BBC documentary.2 The research featured in the\u000a      Annual Report of the Chief Scientist of the Food Standards Agency 2009\/10.3\u000a      Dr Shuja Shafi of the Muslim Council of Britain stated that Muslims would\u000a      be extremely annoyed and extremely distressed to learn that chicken sold\u000a      as halal contains protein from prohibited species and they would be\u000a      extremely angry if this turned out to be a deliberate deception as Muslims\u000a      rely heavily on accurate food labelling (minutes 53 -55 of programme in\u000a      reference 2).\u000a    As a consequence of York's work it was evident that a complex process had\u000a      been developed to dupe DNA testing, enabling low-cost (pork and cattle)\u000a      gelatin to be sold as `chicken protein' and used as a plumping agent in\u000a      chicken breast meat. Two factories (in Germany and Spain) that produced\u000a      the plumping agents were raided by local inspectors.\u000a    FERA has worked with the York team to apply the University of York\u000a      methods of analysis based on collagen sequencing to their core business of\u000a      food authentication. Specifically, it has determined the species\u000a      provenance of gelatin and hydrolysed collagen added to chicken fillets,\u000a      so-called chicken-plumping agents. In a DEFRA-funded study (&#163;91k contract,\u000a      01\/03\/11 to 31\/03\/12), it validated the technique against other\u000a      commercially-available approaches (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\u000a      (ELISA) and PCR) and found it to be superior, with the alternative\u000a      techniques providing numerous false positive results. This contract\u000a      involved an inter-laboratory trial of the method, including laboratories\u000a      across Europe and in the USA, during which the analytical method was\u000a      transferred successfully to alternative food enforcement laboratories. A\u000a      further DEFRA-funded project (Defra project code FA0126) is transferring\u000a      the method to a wide range of processed foods and pharmaceutical products.\u000a      The method has also been developed and applied to other food matrices for\u000a      FERA customers to screen foods destined for the halal markets and also for\u000a      products such as gelatin capsules (for therapeutic\/supplement\u000a      formulations) aimed at vegetarian customers.\u000a    Since the outbreak of BSE in 1987, the inclusion of animal proteins has\u000a      been banned in animal feeds to prevent cannibalism in the food chain.\u000a      There is scope to relax the extended feed ban, should scientific methods\u000a      be available to first screen animal feeds and then to provide confirmatory\u000a      analysis of positive samples. A method was developed by the York team\u000a      during this partnership to determine the species origin of bone chips\u000a      using the collagen method. This method is currently being reported to the\u000a      EU, and FERA is publicising its availability.\u000a    There is now interest from various laboratories in Europe, as well as key\u000a      government research laboratories to license the method for gelatin\u000a      identification; the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is one of six\u000a      partners in this development. Training in the methodology has been\u000a      provided by the York team for FERA and for analytical laboratories from\u000a      across Europe and North America (including the US FDA). The York team made\u000a      species-specific marker peptide sequences available to FERA, that are now\u000a      being used as internal standards in this assay. FERA is also training two\u000a      Malaysian laboratories in the method.\u000a    In 2013, inclusion of horse meat in ready meals affected numerous\u000a      products in the UK and other EU countries. FERA has demonstrated that, as\u000a      expected, York's approach is also able to identify horse gelatin. FERA has\u000a      funding approved to adapt the pork and beef methods for horse gelatin\u000a      (Defra project code FA0126).\u000a    Quotations to support impact:\u000a    Collins was co-opted as a consultant to an EU project SAFEED-PAP, 6th EC\u000a      FP, DG RTD. The archaeological method proved particularly appropriate to\u000a      the detection of animal bone fragments. Dr Ir Vincent Baeten, Head of the\u000a      Food and Feed Unit, EU Reference Laboratory said: \"I have to applaud\u000a        the innovative analytical solution that the Department has proposed for\u000a        detection of animal bone, using protein mass-spectrometry (ZooMS). I\u000a        would like also to recognise the effort made by the Department to adapt\u000a        this method coming from archaeology to feed safety\".4\u000a    Dr Adrian Charlton, Head of Chemical and Biochemical Profiling at FERA\u000a      wrote as follows, corroborating the nature and extent of the collaboration\u000a      with FERA:\u000a    \"FERA's close collaboration with Professors Thomas-Oates and Collins\u000a        have led to a number of technologies that we routinely exploit to\u000a        deliver ongoing project work and to underpin project proposals, papers\u000a        and publicity material. In particular, we have undertaken a number of\u000a        studies to determine peptide sequences that can be used for the species\u000a        origin determination in collaboration with you and your colleagues.\u000a        These projects have led to FERA offering an international service for\u000a        the species identification of gelatin and MBM in food and feed,\u000a        respectively.\"5\u000a    The research undertaken in York has provided the food standards and\u000a      enforcement agencies with the ability to determine the animal source(s) of\u000a      processed foods in which DNA analysis is not possible, by targeting the\u000a      protein which is the principal component of meat. The York methods have\u000a      been adopted by the UK agencies and transferred to equivalent bodies in\u000a      other countries. The need for these analyses has been demonstrated through\u000a      BBC and FSA investigations of fraudulent labelling and further\u000a      disseminated in the press. The importance and broad applicability of these\u000a      approaches has been further highlighted by this year's horsemeat scandal.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    York's analytical methods have been applied in food authentication,\u000a      traceability and safety and have been shown to be superior to other\u000a      methods. Mass spectrometric methods developed in York for the\u000a      identification of archaeological bone samples rely on analysing surviving\u000a      fragments of the bone protein, collagen. These techniques also identify\u000a      collagen fragments present in gelatin-based plumping agents that retain\u000a      water in meats for human consumption. York's authentication applications\u000a      disclosed the animal species from which the collagen was derived, and\u000a      revealed contamination of chicken with pork-derived plumping agents, a\u000a      significant issue in communities with halal and kosher diets. These\u000a      results have been disseminated by high-profile media reporting, including\u000a      a one-hour BBC special, and the press. The Food and Environment Research\u000a      Agency (FERA, a DEFRA agency) has validated the York analytical method and\u000a      applied it to processed food and pharmaceutical products. An\u000a      inter-laboratory trial transferred the method to other food enforcement\u000a      laboratories across Europe and the USA (including the US FDA). The results\u000a      were highlighted in the press in 2009 and the debate over food\u000a      authentication exploded in 2013 highlighting the economic effects of\u000a      mislabelling.

The protein\u000a      collagen has extraordinary stability due to its three-dimensional\u000a      structure, which has led to the idea that collagen can persist for\u000a      thousands of years essentially intact. However, the structural features\u000a      that make collagen so stable were for a long time also considered to make\u000a      collagen useless as a species indicator. The highly conserved main\u000a      collagen chain is made up largely of a tripeptide repeat\u000a      (glycine-proline-hydroxyproline), while the chain-terminating\u000a      `telopeptides' were believed to be intractable, due to their cross-linking\u000a      that is crucial for collagen fibril formation. In collaborative work, a\u000a      postdoctoral fellow and PhD student (both NERC-funded) in the York\u000a      research groups investigated collagen's preservation and developed\u000a      approaches to its extraction from fossil bones.\u000a    The collaborators have shown that one of the C-terminal\u000a      telopeptides is not involved in cross-linking and has some\u000a      species-diagnostic value. In addition, and more importantly, the groups\u000a      have demonstrated that the `conserved' repetitive collagen backbone\u000a      polypeptides in fact have a good deal of species-specific amino-acid\u000a      sequence variation. The work has shown that collagen can be extracted\u000a      effectively from very small samples of bone and, using the sample handling\u000a      strategies developed in this collaboration, employed to identify\u000a      historical and archaeological bone fragments in the archaeological record.\u000a      In these studies, as in much archaeological research, a broad network of\u000a      collaborators is involved, all studying the same assemblages or samples.\u000a      The role of the York chemists involved mass spectrometry (sample\u000a      preparation, measurement and data analysis).The NERC-funded PhD\u000a      studentship was a CASE Award with Prosper de Mulder, a meat and bone meal\u000a      company, whose interest was in detecting not ancient but heat-treated meat\u000a      and bone meal, and the ability to identify its animal source. The approach\u000a      is similarly applicable to the detection and analysis of gelatin, which is\u000a      produced from the collagen in bone on boiling. One of the outcomes of\u000a      these projects is a rapid, affordable, medium-throughput method for\u000a      detecting and determining the species of origin of archaeological bone\u000a      fragments. The method which York termed Zooarchaeology by Mass\u000a      Spectrometry or ZooMS, has been reported widely (e.g. Chemistry World,\u000a      Nov 2010, 44; Science, 2010, 330, 28-29), and a large\u000a      database of collagen amino acid sequences has been assembled (Figure).

The outcomes of the collaboration also led FERA to invite the\u000a      York team to join an EU Framework 6 project (SAFEED-PAP, Jan 2007-Dec\u000a      2009) to determine the species origin of proteins in animal feed (grant of\u000a      &#163;143k).\u000a    \u000a    \u000a    \u000a    Key researchers\u000a    Jane E.

For many years, the adverse symptoms of this condition have been\u000d\u000a      mitigated successfully with regular injections of insulin. Initially these\u000d\u000a      insulins were obtained from bovine and\/or porcine sources, but they did\u000d\u000a      not mimic well actions of endogenous insulin, leading to frequent\u000d\u000a      hypo-glycaemia and other complications. In 1980, the first clinical trials\u000d\u000a      were begun of recombinant insulins obtained by protein engineering\u000d\u000a      methods. From these trials it soon became apparent that the rate of\u000d\u000a      insulin action in vivo was a key factor in the therapeutic\u000d\u000a      potential of the enzyme. The best results were obtained when the insulin\u000d\u000a      injectate contained a mixture of fast-acting and slow-acting insulins,\u000d\u000a      where the latter avoids the need to have regular repeated injections and\u000d\u000a      minimise hypoglycemia, and the former is necessary to treat the rapid rise\u000d\u000a      in blood glucose levels that accompanies ingestion of food.\u000d\u000a    Accordingly recombinant insulin producers concentrated on controlling the\u000d\u000a      rate of action of insulin and its analogues. Amongst these, Novo-Nordisk\u000d\u000a      in collaboration with YSBL, led the way in trying to find a structural\u000d\u000a      rationale for the controlled disaggregation rates of hexameric insulin.\u000d\u000a      YSBL was the world's leading laboratory for insulin structures, and the\u000d\u000a      large majority of the structural work for Novo-Nordisk on insulins from\u000d\u000a      1993 to 2000 was done in conjunction with YSBL. The protein structures\u000d\u000a      published from York are available as coordinates in the Protein Data Bank.7\u000d\u000a      The collaboration between YSBL and Novo-Nordisk was supported by several\u000d\u000a      grants.8 This development programme was highly successful and\u000d\u000a      consequently today Novo-Nordisk is the leading developer and world's\u000d\u000a      largest producer of recombinant insulin for treatment of diabetes.\u000d\u000a    The first new product that came from York structural studies was the\u000d\u000a      aspartate mutant described above.1,2 This fast-acting insulin\u000d\u000a      was launched in 1999, marketed as NovoLog&#174; in the US and\u000d\u000a      Insulin Novorapid&#174; in Europe.9\u000d\u000a    The second development came from the derivatised insulins, which were\u000d\u000a      conceived directly from the structural work described in reference 4\u000d\u000a      above. It was discovered that the attachment of a fatty acid to insulin\u000d\u000a      led to its prolonged action, resulting in just one daily intravenous\u000d\u000a      administration of the hormone. These derivatised insulins received FDA\u000d\u000a      approval in 2005, and are marketed as the product Levemir&#174; (or\u000d\u000a      Insulin Detemir&#174;) and are now the mainstay of Novo Nordisk's\u000d\u000a      insulin products. Its new, improved generation insulin Degludec&#174;\u000d\u000a      was approved by the EU and Chuikyo (Japan) in 2013.\u000d\u000a    Levemir&#174;, NovoRapid and NovoLog&#174; (also marketed as\u000d\u000a      Novomix&#174; in a different formulation) are true blockbuster drugs\u000d\u000a      with billion dollar sales (reference 10). Levemir&#174; had US sales\u000d\u000a      of $1.7 billion in 2012 growing from $756 million in 2008. The\u000d\u000a      corresponding figures for Novolog&#174; are $1.6 billion and $1.1\u000d\u000a      billion, and for Novorapid, $2.7 billion and $1.5 billion. Levemir&#174;\u000d\u000a      and Novolog&#174; are currently number 40 and 42 in the ranking of\u000d\u000a      US drugs by sales.

The original\u000d\u000a      therapy for Type I diabetics was injection of insulin crystals extracted\u000d\u000a      from pig or cow pancreas. However, it did not reproduce the physiological\u000d\u000a      blood levels of insulin and caused immune responses to foreign hormones.\u000d\u000a      All these led to the long-term complications associated with insulin\u000d\u000a      therapy.\u000d\u000a    From 1984 to 2000, YSBL engaged in a major collaboration on recombinant,\u000d\u000a      novel modified insulins with Novo Nordisk A\/S (www.novonordisk.com).\u000a      The structures of these analogues provided a detailed understanding of the\u000d\u000a      nature of insulin aggregation. The focus of the work in 1993 moved towards\u000d\u000a      the rational design of modified insulins in order to obtain clinically\u000d\u000a      applicable monomeric insulins &#8212; they are now the basis of the modern\u000d\u000a      \"fast-acting\" insulins. Furthermore, structures of insulin crystals with\u000d\u000a      various additives and\/or modifications identified some general principles\u000d\u000a      on how to increase stability of insulin hexamers, leading to the current\u000d\u000a      \"long-lasting\" insulin preparations.\u000d\u000a    Research during period. The key breakthroughs during the\u000d\u000a      assessment period were carried out by J. L Whittingham and R. E. Hubbard\u000d\u000a      with G. G. Dodson:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aDesign of rapid-acting monomeric insulins: The crystal\u000d\u000a        structure of insulin hexamers and dimers suggested amino acid mutations,\u000d\u000a        which would lead to a monomeric insulin. The structures of such proteins\u000d\u000a        are reported in references 1 (1993) and 2 (1998). In one of these\u000d\u000a        proteins, B28 proline is mutated to aspartic acid; this is the insulin\u000d\u000a        of the Novo Nordisk product Insulin aspart.&#174;\u000a\u000d\u000a      \u000aIdentifying additives to stabilise insulin preparations:\u000d\u000a        References 2 (1998) and 3 (1995) describe structures of series of\u000d\u000a        preparations in which hexamer formation is stabilised. The structure of\u000d\u000a        a m-cresol-insulin clathrate led to the proposal that mutation\u000d\u000a        to tryptophan at the end of the B chain would disrupt the insulin\u000d\u000a        aggregate. This mutant was found to have improved stability in Novo\u000d\u000a        Nordisk's very complex protein manufacturing processes.\u000d\u000a      \u000aModifications to generate long-active insulins: References 4\u000d\u000a        (1997) and 5 (2004) report the crystal structures of acylated insulins\u000d\u000a        which had been identified by Novo Nordisk as prolonged-acting insulins.\u000d\u000a        The YSBL research suggested that the prolonged action was more likely to\u000d\u000a        be related to the way that these modified insulins aggregated in\u000d\u000a        solution (and in the crystals). These soluble prolonged-acting insulins\u000d\u000a        are significantly better for diabetics than other long-acting insulins.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Insulin research in York continues. Throughout the 2000s AM Brzozowski of\u000d\u000a      YSBL worked with an international team on the development of super-active\u000d\u000a      analogues of insulin. These have provided the tools that enabled a\u000d\u000a      breakthrough in 2013 (reference 6) in the determination of the structure\u000d\u000a      of the first insulin receptor-insulin complex. Insights from this work\u000d\u000a      will have an impact in the future on the design of further insulin\u000d\u000a      analogues with the prospect of oral delivery of insulin.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers:\u000d\u000a    G.

An estimated 62,000 people develop the disease each\u000a      year, of which the majority are in the early stages of the disease. Prior\u000a      to the date of onset of the impact (March 2011), the three anti-\u000a      cholinesterase drugs, Aricept (donepezil), Reminyl (galantamine) and\u000a      Exelon (rivastigmine), although clinically approved much earlier, were not\u000a      available on the NHS for early stage Alzheimer's. The decision as to\u000a      whether any treatment is available on the NHS is made by the National\u000a      Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE). NICE considered that the\u000a      drugs offered insufficient patient benefit to justify their cost and\u000a      sought additional longer-term clinical data and a rationale for their\u000a      action [9].\u000a    The mechanism of action for the drug galantamine was elucidated by the\u000a      research carried out at Lancaster. NICE eventually reversed their earlier\u000a      decision in Mar 2011 [10] taking into account the additional clinical\u000a      data, the mechanistic rationale for use of galantamine in early\u000a      Alzheimer's (Lancaster research), and in response to pressure from various\u000a      patient and carer groups, clinicians, and most notably from Alzheimer's\u000a      Society [11-13]. There was an additional argument for the reversal of the\u000a      initial decision, namely that the initial economic model used by NICE to\u000a      calculate whether the drugs offered \"value for money\", did not accurately\u000a      reflect the hidden economic costs of care outside of hospital. The\u000a      Alzheimer's Society used Lancaster's research as a part of its campaign,\u000a      generalising the findings to the entire class of anti-cholinesterase drugs\u000a      (galantamine, donepezil, and rivastigmine). The clinical studies revealed\u000a      that patients with \"mild\" i.e. early stage Alzheimer's did indeed benefit\u000a      from these drugs. Lancaster's basic research (in which NMR spectroscopy\u000a      played a crucial role) provided the mechanistic evidence for the disease-\u000a      modifying effects of the drug galantamine, thus rationalising the clinical\u000a      results.\u000a    The policy change by NICE has led to direct impact, enhancing the quality\u000a      of life for 100,000s of Alzheimer's patients (over 300,000 galantamine\u000a      prescriptions alone were dispensed in the UK in 2012 [8]). This in turn\u000a      would have had a substantial, indirect impact on the lives of spouses,\u000a      immediate family, and those involved in caring for the sufferers. The\u000a      impact continues as new patients come into the pool.\u000a    The impact is certainly beyond the UK, though this cannot be\u000a      corroborated. The UK medicines regulatory bodies, which include the\u000a      Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and NICE, are\u000a      seen as important standards across the world. The confidence expressed by\u000a      NICE in the use of galantamine and related drugs in early stage\u000a      Alzheimer's would have enhanced the use of these drugs in other parts of\u000a      the world.\u000a    The interdisciplinary chemistry-biomedical Lancaster research into the\u000a      disease-modifying effects of galantamine was directly funded by the\u000a      Alzheimer's Society over the period 2006-2009. The Society promptly\u000a      recognised the significance of the results that suggested that treatment\u000a      should be initiated at the earliest stages of development of Alzheimer's\u000a      disease. The research and its implications were widely publicised through\u000a      their printed literature and their website [14-16].\u000a    The following quotation from Alzheimer's Society Newsletter `The Journal\u000a      of Quality Research in Dementia' [14] refers directly to the Lancaster\u000a      research:\u000a    \"There is an exciting piece of research from David Allsop's group in\u000a        Lancaster, looking at the potential therapeutic properties of existing\u000a        acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs are used currently for\u000a        treating symptoms of dementia, but there is lack of substantial evidence\u000a        to show whether or not they may be of therapeutic value in treating\u000a        disease progression. The results of this current study will highlight\u000a        important evidence in putting forward an argument in using these drugs\u000a        in a therapeutic context.\"\u000a    The impact case study is supported by a letter [17] from the former\u000a      Director of Research (2003- 2011) of Alzheimer's Society from which the\u000a      following passage is reproduced:\u000a    \"The Amyloid &#946; aggregation starts in the brain many years before\u000a        symptoms of dementia appear in Alzheimer's disease and the search is\u000a        still on for drugs that can prevent the aggregation early. Prof Allsop's\u000a        research demonstrating that Galantamine had an additional biochemical\u000a        activity of inhibiting this aggregation was an important supporting\u000a        argument at the time of the campaign. It seemed to promise that the drug\u000a        would likely be efficacious in the early stages of disease. Although not\u000a        evidenced at the time, this result made it more likely that some of the\u000a        other cholinesterase inhibitors might also have biochemical effects in\u000a        addition to the inhibition of acetylcholine degradation....Together with\u000a        the critical reviews of existing clinical research it helped win the\u000a        case for people with dementia and their carers.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The drug galantamine (Reminyl) received approval for the treatment of\u000a      early stages of Alzheimer's disease in 2001. However it was not made\u000a      available on the NHS until March 2011, the effective onset date for the\u000a      impact. The decision as to whether a treatment is available on the NHS is\u000a      made by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), who\u000a      sought additional clinical data and a rationale for the action of the\u000a      drug.

The plaques contain a central deposit of the 39-43\u000a      amino acid peptide &#946;-amyloid (or A&#946;), which accumulates in the form of\u000a      numerous `amyloid' protein fibrils. This accumulation is widely thought to\u000a      be an important step in the early stages of development of AD. Inhibiting\u000a      aggregation of A&#946; or blocking its neurotoxic effects are considered to be\u000a      important approaches for developing treatment.\u000a    In 2004, chemists (Thomas Huckerby, Reader in Spectroscopy) and\u000a      biomedical scientists (David Allsop, Chair in Neuroscience; Nigel\u000a      Fullwood, Senior Lecturer; Frances Martin, Senior Lecturer) developed a\u000a      collaborative research programme to investigate potential inhibitors for\u000a      the aggregation of the amyloid peptide A&#946; responsible for plaque formation\u000a      in Alzheimer's disease. This built on Huckerby's long-standing research in\u000a      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with applications to\u000a      biological systems, a notable sustained contribution being structural\u000a      characterisation of polymeric chemical species present in connective\u000a      tissue (see list of references cited in the major review by Huckerby [4]).\u000a      This research continues to thrive [5]. Indeed, NMR spectroscopy is now a\u000a      strategic research area for Lancaster involving significant investment\u000a      with a view to developing an internationally-leading centre for solid\u000a      state NMR. Investment includes two world-class Chair appointments, Mark\u000a      Smith (materials science focus, see e.g. [6]) and David Middleton\u000a      (biomolecular structure and interactions, see e.g. [7]), and University\u000a      commitment to securing a 600 MHz solid-state NMR instrument through\u000a      matched funding.\u000a    The research collaboration initially investigated members of the nicotine\u000a      alkaloid family of chemicals. It was already known that L-(-)-nicotine\u000a      itself was active &#8212; smokers are slightly less susceptible to developing\u000a      Alzheimer's' &#8212; and in \"Alzheimer's\" mice, plaque densities were reduced by\u000a      administration of L-(-)-nicotine. This prompted comparative solution NMR\u000a      studies, combined with other tests which indicated, surprisingly, that the\u000a      enantiomeric D-(+)- form (inactive at nicotinic receptors) showed\u000a      identical binding to histidine residues in the amyloid peptide [1]. Both\u000a      enantiomers inhibited aggregation and reduced the cell toxicity of A&#946;. It\u000a      appeared that this was thus due to weak, relatively non-specific binding,\u000a      possibly involving the anti-oxidant and\/or metal- chelating properties of\u000a      the alkaloid rather than a chiral interaction. Inhibitor studies using NMR\u000a      spectroscopy were then extended to other small molecule species including\u000a      the known Alzheimer's drug, galantamine.\u000a    Galantamine appears to have multiple actions as a drug. It was known to\u000a      have an inhibitory effect on the enzyme acetylcholine esterase (AChE),\u000a      thereby increasing the level of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the\u000a      diseased brain to improve memory and cognition. However, the effectiveness\u000a      of galantamine treatment did not entirely correlate with its AChE\u000a      activity, suggesting an additional unknown mechanism of action.\u000a    Lancaster chemistry research on galantamine showed clear\u000a      concentration-dependent inhibition of aggregation of A&#946; by galantamine, in\u000a        vitro. In complementary biological research, various cell toxicity\u000a      assays showed that galantamine also reduced the cytotoxicity induced by\u000a      A&#946;. NMR spectroscopy involving a combination of 1D and 2D approaches was\u000a      employed to identify the locations and 3D-shape of all 16 proton sites to\u000a      reveal the galantamine conformation in solution. Following on, difference\u000a      NMR spectroscopy was employed to ascertain whether galantamine interacted\u000a      with A&#946; in solution. The results (perturbations in the proton shifts)\u000a      revealed a fast- exchange interaction of galantamine with A&#946; involving\u000a      histadine residues on A&#946;, explaining the effects of the drug on A&#946;\u000a      aggregation and toxicity [2]. These results suggest that galantamine may\u000a      not act purely as a symptomatic treatment for AD. The drug possibly had disease-modifying\u000a      effects, due to the neuroprotection afforded against A&#946; aggregation and\u000a      toxicity. A significant inference arising from this research is that the\u000a      drug should be prescribed as early as possible to check or even reverse\u000a      the course of the disease.\u000a    Funding for the research included a Project Grant (&#163;120k) [3] from the\u000a      Alzheimer's Society on which Allsop was the Principal Investigator with\u000a      Huckerby, Fullwood, and Martin as Co- Investigators. Huckerby was assisted\u000a      in the study by a project student, Robert Millichamp. Other researchers at\u000a      Lancaster University included Research Associates Susan Moore and Leanne\u000a      Cooper, who provided electron microscopy expertise and capability.\u000a    Complementary research focussing on the effects of galantamine on\u000a      apoptosis induced by A&#946; in cell models was carried out by Brian Austen and\u000a      his co-workers at St. George's Hospital Medical School, London.

Linda Swanson [1-5] was a PhD student on the programme, who\u000a      was subsequently\u000a      employed by Royal Mail for three years. Paul Brown and Alistair McCabe,\u000a      employed at Royal Mail\u000a      Research Laboratories, were members of the research team [1-5]. The\u000a      research initiated through\u000a      the partnership with Lancaster University was subsequently refined at\u000a      Royal Mail Research\u000a      Laboratories, which led to a further patent [7] where practical ink\u000a      formulations are described which\u000a      include the addition of an opacifying agent (to enhance the fluorescence\u000a      signal on highly coloured\u000a      envelopes and wrappings, and therefore enhancing the reliability of the\u000a      automated barcode\u000a      reading equipment). A further development was to incorporate dyes that\u000a      could be monitored at two\u000a      distinct excitation wavelengths (e.g. 365 nm and 420 nm) which can be\u000a      `read' using a combination\u000a      of UV and visible illumination. Such formulation is typical of what is\u000a      used by Royal Mail to print\u000a      digital postmarks (DPMs) as barcodes on letters and parcels.\u000a    The IMPACT is evident under THREE distinct headings:\u000a    SAFETY &#8212; The earlier formulations, based on formaldehyde (a\u000a      suspected carcinogen), have been\u000a      replaced by safer polyacrylic and later styrene-acrylic resins [7]. The\u000a      principal impact is on the\u000a      safety of Royal Mail workers who operate the barcoding printers where the\u000a      risk of exposure to the\u000a      wet inks is greatest. Other postal workers, such as postmen and women who\u000a      are exposed to the\u000a      cured inks throughout their daily employment, will not be subjected to\u000a      persistent formaldehyde\u000a      outgassing. Neither will the general public be exposed to formaldehyde.\u000a      Safety, of paramount\u000a      importance, is a significant impact that is directly related to the inks\u000a      developed through the\u000a      Lancaster University\/Royal Mail partnership.\u000a    EFFICIENCY &#8212; Royal Mail is characterised by its massive\u000a      daily throughput of letters and parcels\u000a      (typically 58 million items per day [8]). The logistics can only be\u000a      realised in a sensible and cost-effective\u000a      way through the extensive application of intelligent automation.\u000a      Fundamental to the\u000a      automation of postal delivery is the ability to assign each postal item\u000a      uniquely, and with sufficient\u000a      data to ensure accurate delivery to the intended destination. The DPMs, as\u000a      barcodes, are readable\u000a      by intelligent letter sorting machines. Prior to 2006, most mail was still\u000a      hand sorted, which is a\u000a      \"slow and cumbersome process\" [8]. Royal Mail introduced a major\u000a      modernisation programme in\u000a      2006-07, coincident with the updated coding ink formulation [7], [8].\u000a      During this modernisation\u000a      programme, 64 intelligent letter sorting machines were installed, each\u000a      capable of processing up to\u000a      40,000 items of mail per hour [7]. This has also led to the adoption of\u000a      Compact Sequence Sorters\u000a      that are \"walk-sequenced\", so that letters are ordered to minimise the\u000a      travel distance by postmen\u000a      and women. This now accounts for about 75% of all deliveries. This has the\u000a      direct impact of\u000a      reducing the workload of the delivery personnel, and thereby increasing\u000a      efficiency of the delivery\u000a      process. In turn, this efficiency improvement leads to a reduction in\u000a      cost. During the year 2011-12,\u000a      a total of 235 new, refurbished or upgraded process sequencing machines\u000a      were installed across\u000a      the UK Royal Mail network. The coding inks are pivotal to the IMPACT\u000a      achieved in terms of postal\u000a      delivery efficiency.\u000a    FINANCIAL &#8212; Royal Mail has been hit by a general decline in\u000a      mail volumes within the last decade\u000a      due to electronic substitution of paper communication (for example, Royal\u000a      Mail observed a 3.1%\u000a      pa decline in letter volumes between 2005 and 2008). For Royal Mail to\u000a      remain competitive\u000a      alongside the trend towards electronic communication, it has been\u000a      essential to enhance their\u000a      efficiency, as described above. This will continue to be an acute risk for\u000a      Royal Mail, as they predict\u000a      letters will decline 5% pa during the period 2013-18; and 4% pa during\u000a      2018-23 [9]. The UK market\u000a      present and predicted volumes are: 2012 (Letters 13.8 billion; Parcels 1.7\u000a      billion); 2023 (Letters 8.3\u000a      billion; Parcels 2.3 billion) [9]. Recent (2011) revenue figures for Royal\u000a      Mail are &#163;5.2 billion pa [8].\u000a      This is a significant business in its own right that is dependant for\u000a      efficiency upon the coded inks\u000a      developed from the expertise at the University of Lancaster. From a\u000a      societal standpoint, the\u000a      IMPACT is far greater, since the mail volume accounts for vital\u000a      communications within both the\u000a      domestic and business sectors, with a predicted volume in excess of 10\u000a      billion items pa up to\u000a      2023, even in the light of the trend towards electronic communication. The\u000a      recent flotation of Royal\u000a      Mail, the oversubscription of prospective shareholders, and the rapid\u000a      increase of share value by\u000a      48% [10] is clear evidence of a flourishing business with a strong future\u000a      prospect. The IMPACT of\u000a      the coding inks has played a significant part in the success of Royal Mail\u000a      through the facilitation of\u000a      considerable efficiency gains through intelligent automation. This is\u000a      IMPACT that is set to continue\u000a      to deliver for the foreseeable future [9].\u000a    With respect to corroboration, we quote below from a correspondence [11]\u000a      with Linda Swanson\u000a      who contributed to the fundamental research as a PhD student but then went\u000a      onto work for Royal\u000a      Mail and played a key role in embedding the printing inks science and\u000a      technology within Royal\u000a      Mail. She is therefore well placed to corroborate the implementation of\u000a      the technology within Royal\u000a      Mail.\u000a    `the most important and tangible output from this work is the red ink\u000a        which currently appears on letters\u000a        coded by Royal Mail &#8212; this was the ink that was designed and developed\u000a        at Lancaster during that\u000a        project.'\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Fundamental research in collaboration with Royal\u000a      Mail into luminescence molecules constrained\u000a      within a water-soluble acrylic polymer matrix has\u000a      led to the development of novel, water-soluble, ink-jet\u000a      printable, luminescent inks. These inks are\u000a      employed by Royal Mail for printing coding patterns\u000a      on envelopes that can be read by automatic letter-sorting\u000a      machines. The inks offer excellent\u000a      performance in humid environments, on coloured\u000a      paper, and on paper containing optical brighteners,\u000a      and are safer.

R. \"Tim\" Lane, a Senior Scientist at the Royal Mail\u000a      Research Laboratories,\u000a      approached Dr John Ebdon, Senior Lecturer, Chemistry Department, Lancaster\u000a      University, for help\u000a      in improving the physical and chemical properties of ink-jet printable\u000a      inks used for printing\u000a      machine-readable patterns of dots (representing postal codes) on\u000a      envelopes, enabling the\u000a      envelopes to be automatically sorted. At the time, the inks already in use\u000a      for this purpose were\u000a      based on suspensions of relatively simple phosphors in aqueous solutions\u000a      of amino resins. These\u000a      inks were believed first to dry and then to cure (crosslink) when applied\u000a      to paper, providing a solid\u000a      hydrophobic medium in which phosphorescence could develop and be \"read\"\u000a      when the envelope\u000a      was passed under a UV lamp. There were three problems with the inks: (1)\u000a      the inks contained\u000a      small amounts of free formaldehyde (a suspected carcinogen); (2) they were\u000a      slow to dry\/cure,\u000a      leading to an unacceptable delay before the coding pattern could be read,\u000a      and (3) they performed\u000a      poorly in humid environments.\u000a    The academic outcomes of the project are described in five papers\u000a      published jointly by Royal Mail\u000a      and Lancaster University over the period 1995-1999 [1-5]. These\u000a      demonstrate: (1) that water-soluble\u000a      acrylic polymer solutions, e.g. aqueous solutions of polyacrylic and\u000a      polymethacrylic acids,\u000a      during the process of drying undergo a \"coil-collapse\" process whereby the\u000a      interiors of the polymer\u000a      coils become sufficiently hydrophobic to act as hosts for hydrophobic,\u000a      luminescent materials\u000a      (guests); (2) that in these collapsed coils, luminescence of the guest can\u000a      occur without significant\u000a      quenching, even before the solution has fully dried; (3) that the onset of\u000a      coil-collapse is influenced\u000a      by temperature and pH; and (4) that the hydrophobicity of the collapsed\u000a      coil can be increased by\u000a      the incorporation of small amounts of a hydrophobic monomer, such as\u000a      styrene or methyl\u000a      methacrylate. A further outcome, not published at the time owing to\u000a      commercial sensitivity, was the\u000a      demonstration that a bi-component luminescent system in a polymer matrix,\u000a      in which energy\u000a      transfer to a fluorescent compound occurs, could be used to give long-lived\u000a        red luminescence.\u000a    The fundamental research on the behaviours of water-based polymer systems\u000a      carried out at\u000a      Lancaster, and the more applied aspects researched jointly by Lancaster\u000a      and Royal Mail, led to the\u000a      patenting of polyacrylic acid binders together with various combinations\u000a      of luminescent compounds\u000a      for use in mail coding inks, by Royal Mail in 1998 [6]. These patents\u000a      refer to the environmental\u000a      hazards posed by the earlier amino resin binders and for the desirability\u000a      that the ink should contain\u000a      a long-lived red emitter so as to allow signals to be read (a)\u000a      irrespective of the substrate colour, (b)\u000a      in the presence of a fluorescence background from any optical brighteners\u000a      in the envelope paper,\u000a      and (c) throughout the period during which the coding ink is drying.

As air quality becomes an increasingly important issue for\u000a      local authorities worldwide, the product developed as a result of research\u000a      by Monks\/Leigh (UoL) in partnership with De Montfort University and\u000a      marketed by TRL, is expected to have a global market of &#163; several\u000a      millions.\u000a    THE-ISSUE (2011-14, D) is a project for co-ordination and\u000a      exploitation of Research, Technology, Development and Innovation (RTDI) in\u000a      areas related to Traffic, Health and the Environment. The project is led\u000a      from G-STEP with French, Italian and Polish partners, who together support\u000a      over 100 RTD projects (42 in the East Midlands) that use some degree of\u000a      ICT, satellite-derived spatial data infrastructure (SDI) or location and\u000a      timing services from satellites for transport applications in: intelligent\u000a      transport systems; traffic management; intermodal solutions for public\u000a      transport and citizens; freight logistics; and air quality management.\u000a    At an international level, G-STEP has been leading the NEREUS (Network of\u000a      Regions in Europe Using Space) EO\/GMES working group and produced the \"The\u000a      Growing Use of Space Across Europe\" document that was launched at the\u000a      European parliament in October 2012 [B].\u000a    C) Environmental Products\u000a      G-STEP has worked with Havana Energy (a British power-generating company,\u000a      E) and the Cuban Government to develop an `energy map' of several\u000a      regions in Cuba. The work shows the amount of biomass available for use as\u000a      a renewable energy source. Exploiting satellite-derived data to estimate\u000a      the amount of biomass available allows Cuba to plan for the exploitation\u000a      of its own natural resources to meet energy needs. An ancillary output of\u000a      the project is to identify and manage unwanted non-productive invasive\u000a      species of plant which will be replaced by sugar crops.

The group undertakes fundamental and leading research in\u000a      applied physics, chemistry and geography as well as developing\u000a      technological innovation through the design and production of satellite\u000a      instruments for observing the Earth mainly with funding from NERC, ESA and\u000a      industry. The group exploits EO data for climate change studies, air\u000a      quality, environmental monitoring and mapping applications with everyday\u000a      impact [1]. The quality of the science is evidenced by leading positions\u000a      on international science teams, data exploitation and EC services. The\u000a      major EOS research themes are a) Air Quality (led by Monks\u000a      (Chemistry, 1996- present) with Leigh (Chemistry, 2010- present),\u000a      b) Climate Change (led by Remedios (Physics and Astronomy, 2000 - present)\u000a      c) Land-surface change (led by Baltzer (Geography, 2006 - present) and d)\u000a      Space Technology (led by Monks (Chemistry).\u000a    G-STEP draws from a portfolio of research translating a wide knowledge\u000a      base into industrial impact, within which a key driver is responding to\u000a      company needs and problems, thus making it demand rather than supply led.\u000a      Research that has been translated in G-STEP includes work by Monks\u000a      and Leigh who have developed new technology and measurements from\u000a      space [2, 3], ground [4] and aircraft for validating emissions of criteria\u000a      air pollutants, in particular nitrogen dioxide. Air quality work has\u000a      focussed on quantifying oxidative capacity change in urban and rural\u000a      environments over the last decade [5]. Results have shown that the\u000a      effectiveness of air quality reductions in ozone precursors is being\u000a      masked by a combination of meteorological variability and change in\u000a      background conditions [5]. The work on Air Quality detection and\u000a      attribution [2, 4] is the basis for the intelligent traffic management\u000a      system described latterly. The greenhouse-gas (GHG) from space work [3]\u000a      has quantified regional GHG budgets, and has latterly been translated into\u000a      the policy arena, as has the ozone work [5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43927","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research within the Unit principally impacts on national and\u000d\u000a      international policy in respect of safe disposal of radioactive wastes, a\u000d\u000a      problem whose long term global significance cannot be overstated. The\u000d\u000a      scope of expertise within the Radiochemistry Research Group at\u000d\u000a      Loughborough University has ensured that the reach of the impact spans a\u000d\u000a      range of different aspects with international dimension. Examples from\u000d\u000a      four areas are given below, dealing with in turn: design of deep\u000d\u000a      geological repositories for nuclear wastes, the effect of organic matter\u000d\u000a      on radionuclide speciation-solubility, marine discharges, and management\u000d\u000a      of non-nuclear sources of radioactive materials (NORM). Examples from the\u000d\u000a      first three areas contribute to the broader remit of safeguarding the\u000d\u000a      environment, while the final studies show how the Unit has shaped policy.\u000d\u000a    &#8226;Safeguarding the Environment\u000d\u000a    Concerns regarding the efficacy of cement as a backfill for conditioning\u000d\u000a      radionuclides as low solubility, immobile species originally led to an\u000d\u000a      avoidance strategy being implemented in nuclear disposal programmes, for\u000d\u000a      example in Finland and Sweden. Although excluding cement entirely is\u000d\u000a      impossible with a deep geological repository, the apparent dichotomy\u000d\u000a      between approaches in national programmes has been exploited by opponents\u000d\u000a      of nuclear waste disposal (and hence new build) to illustrate the\u000d\u000a      uncertainties in process understanding and supporting technologies.\u000d\u000a      Research carried out at Loughborough University has helped reduce the\u000d\u000a      uncertainty by highlighting where cements can fulfil their design function\u000d\u000a      and where components of the system require modification. Specifically, it\u000d\u000a      has been shown that the presence of organic complexants, either natural\u000d\u000a      (humic\/fulvic acids) [3.3] or anthropogenic [3.2]\u000d\u000a      (cellulose degradation products, superplasticisers) can enhance the\u000d\u000a      mobility of otherwise immobile species. Conversely, species that are\u000d\u000a      routinely treated as unretarded through engineered barriers and host rocks\u000d\u000a      in safety case analyses (e.g. technetium, iodine) have been shown to bind\u000d\u000a      effectively to mineral phases; i.e. existing models are overly\u000d\u000a      conservative. Evidence that these findings impact on future programmes\u000d\u000a        can be found in revised research and implementation programmes, for\u000d\u000a      example consideration of alternative backfill materials (e.g.\u000d\u000a      phosphate-amended cement in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, USA;\u000d\u000a      prohibition of superplasticisers in Finland) and manufacture of modified\u000d\u000a      superplasticisers by UK industry (Grace Chemicals). Radio-labelled NOM has\u000d\u000a      been utilised by Loughborough researchers to investigate contaminant\u000d\u000a      transport through a sandy aquifer at the Drigg repository, Cumbria and\u000d\u000a      through the Boom Clay at Mol, Belgium. These studies were used to\u000d\u000a        estimate the importance of organic complexing ligands in facilitating\u000d\u000a        the migration of uranium and plutonium, being cited in Post Closure\u000d\u000a        Safety Cases for each site [5.1], [5.2].\u000d\u000a    David Read, Professor of Radiochemistry at Loughborough University was\u000d\u000a      one of three independent scientists asked to assess the feasibility of\u000d\u000a      technetium abatement technologies on behalf of the Environment Agency.\u000d\u000a      Following acceptance by British Nuclear Fuels Limited of recommendations\u000d\u000a      made by Loughborough University researchers regarding the use of\u000d\u000a      tetraphenylphosphonium bromide (TPPB) as a technetium sequestering agent,\u000d\u000a        a &#163;100m treatment plant was commissioned and discharges of 99Tc\u000a        to the Irish Sea are now reduced by 90% compared to previous levels\u000d\u000a      [5.3]. The corollary was accumulation of a new waste-form\u000d\u000a      whose long-term behaviour when encapsulated in cement was unknown.\u000d\u000a      Fundamental research, commissioned at Loughborough (2004-2011) has\u000d\u000a      established the stability of this waste and shed light on its potential\u000d\u000a      behaviour in the geosphere [3.4, 3.5, 5.4].\u000d\u000a    &#8226; Shaping Policy\u000d\u000a    An enormous volume of radioactive waste is created each year by the\u000d\u000a      production and combustion of fossil fuels and exploitation of industrial\u000d\u000a      minerals. Gross under-estimation of the problem by both industry and\u000d\u000a      Government became apparent during revision of the Environmental Permitting\u000d\u000a      Regulations (EPR) from 2009 onwards. The financial implications of\u000d\u000a      choosing a particular threshold for regulation and clearance of\u000d\u000a      radioactively-contaminated land are enormous and, inevitably, a compromise\u000d\u000a      needs to be reached between the level of environmental protection sought\u000d\u000a      and the finite resources available for remediation. Early drafts of the\u000d\u000a      EPR not only omitted key NORM-producing industries but miscalculated the\u000d\u000a      effect of aggregating progeny radionuclides from the two main natural\u000d\u000a      decay chains (238U and 232Th). The consequence was\u000d\u000a      overly restrictive limits that would have driven many businesses overseas.\u000d\u000a      Input by Loughborough University researchers to consultation documents\u000d\u000a        led to a much improved legislative framework (EPR 2011) [5.5]. The\u000d\u000a      intervention during the formulation of this framework prevented highly\u000d\u000a      damaging changes to Exemption Orders that would have made production of inter\u000a        alia advanced TiO2 and Zr coatings in the UK non-viable.\u000d\u000a      Similar considerations apply to the China Clay industry of SW England\u000d\u000a      where successful remediation of NORM contamination is allowing\u000d\u000a      regeneration of 700ha brownfield land under the Government's EcoTown\u000d\u000a      initiative. This has also impacted European policy; it is noted that China\u000d\u000a      Clay for example, which is also produced in France and the Czech Republic\u000d\u000a      is still not included in the current version of the Basic Safety Standards\u000d\u000a      (EC COM 2012, IAEA 2011) but will be in the next revision following its\u000d\u000a      adoption in the UK. A Loughborough spin-in company (Enviras Limited) was\u000d\u000a      launched in 2011; sited on campus it provides high quality UKAS accredited\u000d\u000a      radiochemical analysis specifically for supporting the remediation of\u000d\u000a      radioactively contaminated land. [5.6]\u000d\u000a    &#8226; Training the Next Generation of Nuclear Specialists\u000d\u000a    The third aspect of the Unit's impact stems from its ability to deliver a\u000d\u000a      strong grounding in radiochemical work for a large number of students both\u000d\u000a      at Undergraduate (e.g. via the 2nd and 3rd year\u000d\u000a      modules \"Radiochemistry\" and \"Physical and Radiochemistry\" respectively)\u000d\u000a      and Postdoctoral levels. Such training has impacted significantly on the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of bodies such as the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority who\u000d\u000a      currently employ undergraduate and doctoral graduates from the Unit in a\u000d\u000a      range of senior positions. Many other organisations whose activities hinge\u000d\u000a      on radiochemical expertise have employed undergraduate and postgraduate\u000d\u000a      students who have benefited from the research environment in the Unit,\u000d\u000a      through their doctoral work (with17 students engaged in PhD work during\u000d\u000a      the REF period) and undergraduate\/MSc research projects etc.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at Loughborough University during the REF period (and extending\u000d\u000a      back at least three decades beyond that) has had a significant impact on\u000d\u000a      national and international policy decisions governing the management of\u000d\u000a      radioactive waste, one of the Grand Challenges facing society.

This high level of\u000d\u000a      technical competence is crucial, as any safety case for the disposal of\u000d\u000a      nuclear wastes must be supported by defensible scientific data and\u000d\u000a      principles. In the context of a geological nuclear waste repository,\u000d\u000a      essential components concern the solubility, speciation and retardation of\u000d\u000a      key radionuclides in groundwaters and barrier materials (e.g. cement),\u000d\u000a      since these affect their migration through the terrestrial environment.\u000d\u000a      Loughborough University researchers have played a major role in carrying\u000d\u000a      out research into these essential areas. Thus, following the failure of\u000d\u000a      the nuclear industry body, Nirex, to gain approval for a deep facility at\u000d\u000a      Sellafield, Loughborough University was entrusted with\u000d\u000a      reducing the key uncertainties via a series of projects (2008-2014)\u000d\u000a      supported by the NDA, EPSRC and EU. The output from this ongoing work\u000d\u000a      [3.1, 3.2] continues to determine whether porous cement could\u000d\u000a      be a viable backfill material for this type of waste. Evidence to date has\u000d\u000a      already underpinned policy changes and the reconsideration of current\u000d\u000a      practices. Loughborough University researchers have made substantial\u000d\u000a      contributions in formulating pan-European thermodynamic models of waste\u000d\u000a      disposal systems. Building on the original CHEMVAL geochemical modelling\u000d\u000a      projects, which set standards for numerical approaches, our most\u000d\u000a      significant contribution has been the development of methods for\u000d\u000a      radio-labelling natural organic matter (NOM) and associated thermodynamic\u000d\u000a      models [3.3].\u000d\u000a    Until 2002, Sellafield discharged large volumes of technetium (as 99Tc)\u000a      into the Irish Sea, the isotope subsequently appearing in marine biota,\u000d\u000a      notably Norwegian lobsters. Such was the environmental concern that an\u000d\u000a      important contract to install a natural gas pipeline from Norway to the UK\u000d\u000a      was placed in jeopardy. Loughborough University researchers played a\u000d\u000a      crucial role in assessing the behaviour of the chosen Tc sequestrant,\u000d\u000a      tetraphenylphosphonium bromide (TPPB), and its long-term stability when\u000d\u000a      encapsulated in a cementitious waste form [3.4, 3.5].\u000d\u000a      Large volumes of radioactive waste (NORM) are created each year by the use\u000d\u000a      of fossil fuels and exploitation of industrial minerals. Research at\u000d\u000a      Loughborough University into scale formation coupled with strategies for\u000d\u000a      inhibition and remediation [3.6] generated high level\u000d\u000a      advice to industry and Government.\u000d\u000a    The following members of staff directed the research during this period:\u000d\u000a    Peter Warwick (PE), Professor of Radiochemistry: 1981 - 2010\u000d\u000a      David Read (DR), Professor of Radiochemistry: 2010 &#8212; present.

In particular, Heggie's research has\u000d\u000a      influenced the Core Component Condition Assessment (CCCA); the CCCA is a\u000d\u000a      key component of the safety assessment that comprises elaborate modelling\u000d\u000a      of reactors, including a module (UMAT) that describes the material\u000d\u000a      properties of the graphite moderator as a function of temperature, coolant\u000d\u000a      composition, neutron dose, and applied stresses. The UMAT module relies on\u000d\u000a      constitutive equations that employ the concept of equivalent temperature\u000d\u000a      (Paper 28). However, the Sussex model has demonstrated this concept is\u000d\u000a      inappropriate for reactor graphite temperatures, and contributed to a\u000d\u000a      decision by the nuclear industry to revise it. Without this demonstration,\u000d\u000a      there was a danger that the &#163;22M Materials Test Reactor programme\u000d\u000a      (Blackstone project) would have produced data less relevant to reactor\u000d\u000a      operation.\u000d\u000a    More importantly, in light of the Sussex model, Paper 28 (which employed\u000d\u000a      the equivalent temperature concept) has been replaced by EDF with a new\u000d\u000a      paper (`P28') that uses a new graphite behaviour model (B++) that does not\u000d\u000a      invoke the equivalent temperature concept. See for example\u000d\u000a      DAO\/JIEC\/162\/AGR\/11 J. Smith and B.C. Davies May 2012 and other Graphite\u000d\u000a      Core Committee papers. [C1]\u000d\u000a    `Paper 28' separated `dimensional change' and `irradiation creep' &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      first being a strain that depended on neutron dose and the second being\u000d\u000a      the response of graphite components to applied stresses while under\u000d\u000a      irradiation. The Sussex model attributes the bulk of dimensional change to\u000d\u000a      basal slip, however, a process inherently related to irradiation creep.\u000d\u000a      The implication of this model is that, rather than being two separate\u000d\u000a      physical processes, irradiation creep is best described as dimensional\u000d\u000a      change occurring under applied stresses. The new behaviour model for the\u000d\u000a      core, being one of the 20 or so potentially life-limiting factors, has\u000d\u000a      allowed an extra 48 total reactor-years, so far, of planned life [C1].\u000d\u000a    Calculations to quantify the impact of the Sussex contribution, are based\u000d\u000a      on reference data from the submission by EDF to the Technology Strategy\u000d\u000a      Board for a project on irradiation creep, which was successful in being\u000d\u000a      funded. These calculations are supported by EDF [C1]. The total plant life\u000d\u000a      extension project (PLEX) provides for an extra nine years of life for 14\u000d\u000a      reactors. At &#163;0.5M per day, per reactor, this equates to &#163;23bn at today's\u000d\u000a      prices. Approximately two thirds of this contributes to the UK economy\u000d\u000a      through the nuclear supply chain (i.e. &#163;15bn). Aside from the direct\u000d\u000a      economic effects, there are also, of course, effects on the UK's carbon\u000d\u000a      dioxide emissions, fossil fuel reduction, and energy deficit.\u000d\u000a    An alternative calculation is based on the present annual contribution to\u000d\u000a      UK GDP of the industry, of about &#163;3.3bn, which gives a potential &#163;30bn\u000d\u000a      over nine years at today's prices. So PLEX is worth &#163;15bn-&#163;30bn to the UK\u000d\u000a      economy at today's prices.\u000d\u000a    An understanding of irradiation creep is estimated as contributing\u000d\u000a      (&#163;500M), i.e. 1\/30th of the &#163;15bn. An understanding of creep is not\u000d\u000a      possible without understanding underlying dimensional change and the\u000d\u000a      Sussex work has provided a foundation for understanding dimensional\u000d\u000a      change, which is conservatively 10-20 per cent of the solution [C1]. This\u000d\u000a      gives an impact of the order of &#163;100M at today's prices, with &#163;40M having\u000d\u000a      accrued already and a further &#163;60M over the rest of the period.\u000d\u000a    Undoubtedly, there remains a difference between what might be possible\u000d\u000a      with engineering solutions and what would be acceptable to the nuclear\u000d\u000a      regulator. Increasing the fundamental understanding helps the industry to\u000d\u000a      maximise its use of engineering solutions to reactor life extension.\u000d\u000a    The EPSRC, in its review of the impact of Chemistry, concludes: `the work\u000d\u000a      at the University of Sussex on graphite as a moderator in AGRs is\u000d\u000a      contributing to the better definition of reactor longevity and safety. If\u000d\u000a      the fourteen UK operating AGRs closed unnecessarily early, by perhaps one\u000d\u000a      year, it could lead to losses running into billions of pounds, threaten\u000d\u000a      the UK's carbon dioxide emission targets (linked to reducing fossil fuel\u000d\u000a      dependency) and widen the nation's energy deficit'. [C2]\u000d\u000a    The importance of Heggie's work in this respect is illustrated by regular\u000d\u000a      invitations for dialogue with EDF Energy Nuclear Generation (EDF-E-NG), by\u000d\u000a      Heggie's invited position on the Graphite Core Committee that has advised\u000d\u000a      EDF-E-NG since 2007, and by Heggie's invitation onto the International\u000d\u000a      Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Collaborative Research Programme on\u000d\u000a      Irradiation Creep in Graphite [C3]. The understanding of graphite damage\u000d\u000a      is also relevant to the material's use in the design and development of\u000d\u000a      generation IV reactors.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This research underpins assessments of nuclear reactor longevity and\u000d\u000a      safety and has contributed to EDF's project to extend the life of nuclear\u000d\u000a      reactors by 100+ reactor-years. So far this project has achieved 48 years\u000d\u000a      or nearly &#163;9bn in benefit. The Sussex contribution is accruing value to\u000d\u000a      the UK economy of an estimated &#163;100M at today's prices, with about &#163;40M of\u000d\u000a      that achieved already. Graphite in nuclear reactors is susceptible to\u000d\u000a      neutron damage, and accurate estimations of the rate of graphite damage in\u000d\u000a      reactors are critical to safety and to predicting reactor lifespan.\u000d\u000a      Research from Sussex has developed models for graphite damage that now\u000d\u000a      underpin one component (of six independent components) of the safety\u000d\u000a      assessments conducted by the nuclear industry for Advanced Gas-cooled\u000d\u000a      Reactors.

It is an ambition of EDF\u000d\u000a      Energy Nuclear Generation (EDF-E-NG), formally British Energy, to achieve\u000d\u000a      an extra 100 reactor-years from existing Advanced Gas-cooled Nuclear\u000d\u000a      Reactors, which equates to &#163;60 billion of additional power output at\u000d\u000a      today's retail prices. Whereas a design life of 25 years invoked very\u000d\u000a      conservative models of graphite behaviour and lifespan following neutron\u000d\u000a      damage in nuclear reactors, the safety assessment for plant extension\u000d\u000a      requires a more precise model that must be supported by new experiments\u000d\u000a      for the neutron doses experienced in the extended lifetime. Such a model\u000d\u000a      has emerged, in part, from the research programme on nuclear graphite at\u000d\u000a      Sussex.\u000d\u000a    Radiation damage changes the shape and size of the crystallites that\u000d\u000a      comprise graphite, a process known as dimensional change, which in turn\u000d\u000a      degrades the mechanical properties of the graphite. The primary focus is\u000d\u000a      on neutron damage, such as atomic displacement damage in which neutrons\u000d\u000a      collide with atoms in the graphite lattice, both creating a `vacancy' (a\u000d\u000a      `point defect') and displacing an atom into another position. Some of the\u000d\u000a      displaced atoms find another vacancy to fill. However, those that do not,\u000d\u000a      come to rest in non-ideal locations; that is, not along the symmetrical\u000d\u000a      lines of the lattice. Because these atoms, known as interstitial atoms,\u000d\u000a      are not in the ideal location they have an energy (Wigner energy)\u000d\u000a      associated with them. When large amounts of interstitial atoms have\u000d\u000a      accumulated they pose a risk of releasing all of their energy suddenly,\u000d\u000a      creating a temperature spike. Sudden unplanned increases in temperature\u000d\u000a      can present a large risk for certain types of nuclear reactors with low\u000d\u000a      operating temperatures and were the indirect cause of the Windscale fire\u000d\u000a      in 1957, the worst nuclear incident in British history.\u000d\u000a    The existing consensus for radiation damage considers the aggregation of\u000d\u000a      interstitial atoms into discs\/sheets of new graphite (graphene) between\u000d\u000a      existing layers, and the aggregation of vacancies into lines, making a\u000d\u000a      slot in the graphite. The Sussex nuclear graphite programme started with\u000d\u000a      discovering in 1997 that the interstitial atoms bonded neighbouring layers\u000d\u000a      together covalently (this is the so-called `spiro'-structure). A whole\u000d\u000a      class of cross-linking defects between graphite layers were found [See\u000d\u000a      Section 3, R1]. It became apparent from research in Sussex that the\u000d\u000a      assumed extreme mobility of interstitial atoms was incorrect and\u000d\u000a      longstanding theories of dimensional change were incomplete [R2]. Archival\u000d\u000a      research confirmed quantitative inadequacies in the theory and so a new\u000d\u000a      theory was proposed, by Heggie and colleagues, with the most important\u000d\u000a      component being reported in 2007 [R2]. The new theory does not rely on the\u000d\u000a      movement of vacancies and interstitial atoms and on the formation of new\u000d\u000a      graphite sheets, but argues that `basal slip' is promoted by neutron\u000d\u000a      collisions, resulting in buckling and folding of existing graphite layers\u000d\u000a      [R6]. This theory is supported experimentally, and has been refined by\u000d\u000a      Heggie and co-workers with improved simulations and diffractograms [R3 and\u000d\u000a      R2]. In the context of the science of radiation damage, this is a paradigm\u000d\u000a      shift, and the description of buckling and folding in layered materials\u000d\u000a      such as graphite is new and fundamental.\u000d\u000a    Key researcher: Malcolm Heggie at Sussex 1\/1\/96 to 30\/9\/2012.\u000d\u000a    "}]

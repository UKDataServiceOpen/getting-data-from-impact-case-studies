[{"CaseStudyId":"1393","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The University was the first university to adopt DMLS\/M in the UK with\u000a      the purchase of a DTM2500+ Sinterstation (year 2000) and then an EOS\u000a      M250Ext machine (year 2004). This equipment was central to application-led\u000a      research [1]. Funding for the equipment came from ERDF grants. The impact\u000a      has been significant for the UK economy and the University, offering\u000a      recognition nationally and internationally [2]. The University also\u000a      co-ordinated a DTI application for &#163;2M led by Rolls-Royce PLC made under a\u000a      Direct Write call [3]. The submission attracted an 18 member industrial\u000a      consortium and the University's collaboration with the consortium (post\u000a      01\/01\/2008) has had profound impact throughout the Additive Layer\u000a      Manufacturing (ALM) sector, e.g. Williams F1 were the first F1 team to\u000a      adopt metal based ALM parts developed and produced by the University. [4];\u000a      a KTP with Powell and Harber Limited [5] achieved production time savings\u000a      of up to 40% for products produced using DMLS tooling with conformal\u000a      channels and the tooling lead times reduced by up to 50% [5]. The results\u000a      from this project have been disseminated [6,7].\u000a    The University won &#163;1M of funding from Advantage West Midlands (AWM) for\u000a      the project \"Process Innovation For Rapid Product Development\". The\u000a      programme ran from June 2007 to September 2010 and the work undertaken\u000a      assisted 47 companies, ensured 125 jobs safeguarded, created 18 new jobs.\u000a      [8] The grant funded the acquisition of an EOS M270Ext DMLS\/M platform.\u000a      This machine was released to the University under a unique research\u000a      agreement and was the first EOS GmbH machine installation globally to\u000a      process `reactive' titanium and aluminium alloys and leading to the\u000a      production readiness for reactive materials of the M270Ext. [1] EOS UK Ltd\u000a      has for the last 5 years supported and promoted the University with &#163;100k\u000a      of `in-kind' powders and &#163;300k for operational software. The University is\u000a      the only educational user of this technology nationally therefore the\u000a      University research activities have impacted on the introduction of the\u000a      technology throughout the EOS(UK) customer base. In 2013 there are now 32\u000a      EOS M270 laser melting systems in 10 UK companies. The University has been\u000a      a catalyst in DMLS\/M technology introduction for 5 of these companies,\u000a      accounting for &#163;2.5M of capital investment. The UK industrial market has\u000a      the largest concentration of this technology worldwide and the University\u000a      has played a significant role in this concentration activity. [4] Sector\u000a      impacts follow:\u000a    Net Shape Tooling; Tooling materials, applications and techniques\u000a      have been refined in order to realise steel and cupro-nickel tooling in\u000a      industry [9-10], Technology transfer programs were used to attract\u000a      companies in to a cluster of net shape process users and then disseminate\u000a      the use and application of DMLS\/M. to the companies. In this instance 50%\u000a      of the companies in PIRPD [8] adopted this type of tooling.\u000a    Jewellery: The University was the first worldwide to develop the\u000a      melting of silver alloys for bespoke jewellery applications. Research\u000a      assistance by The University with process parameter definition and machine\u000a      platform development has led to Cookson Gold Ltd, investing in EOS M280\u000a      technology and subsequently assisting in EOS M080 platform development, a\u000a      bespoke machine developed for precious metals DMLS\/M. [4]\u000a    Motorsport: Research with part and material manufacture for\u000a      Formula 1 teams, including Williams, Mclaren, Mercedes and Red Bull has\u000a      been undertaken. Formative work has led to Mclaren adopting the DMLS\/M\u000a      technology. [4] Collaborative work with the University of Warwick\u000a      validated the use of thin walled titanium Ti-6Al-4V tubes. The work led to\u000a      co-authored papers published in race magazines, TCT conferences and\u000a      journals, e.g. [11]. Co-author David Cooper now works for the DMLS\/M\u000a      bureau Innovate to Make I2M Ltd. Former DMLS\/M technician at the\u000a      University, M.Lindop, now manages the rapid prototyping at Red Bull\u000a      Racing. Recent and on-going confidential work with Mercedes F1 has\u000a      produced pioneering work regarding Ti-6Al-4V components. Large aero parts\u000a      have been developed that have allowed testing and monitoring improvement\u000a      whilst extending the capabilities of the DMLS\/M technology. The impact\u000a      here is still being realised and being applied not only throughout the F1\u000a      sector but also through aerospace and medical sectors. [4]\u000a    Aerospace: The DMLS\/M platform at the University has been used to\u000a      support a Rolls-Royce PLC led programme, namely, \"Strategic Affordable\u000a      Manufacturing in the UK through Leading Environmental Technologies\"\u000a      (SAMULET) programme, this is a Variance-Interbuild project for DMLS\/M\u000a      platforms. Contribution to the programme was to ascertain the\u000a      repeatability for DMLS\/M manufacture across multiple platforms, first\u000a      round of results have been done carried out regionally next round will be\u000a      conducted nationally. [12] Recent work with UTC Aerospace, Wolverhampton\u000a      involves the optimisation of gear and epicyclic gearbox manufacture for\u000a      flap actuation systems. Work here is two-fold, \"very near\" finished shape\u000a      gears have been developed using DMLS\/M, also a research collaboration with\u000a      Birmingham University to hard face wear surfaces is being developed. [4]\u000a    Medical: Impact for DMLS\/M products and research at The University\u000a      is being promoted by conference activity, e.g. [13] and work in this\u000a      sector is expected to grow.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The University was the first adopter of the Direct Metal Laser\u000a      Sintering\/Melting (DMLS\/M) technology in the UK resulting in significant\u000a      research and knowledge transfer activities in the UK and globally. The\u000a      University has and continues to be a catalyst in technology introduction\u000a      for 5 out of the 10 UK companies that use this technology. This accounts\u000a      for &#163;2.5M of capital investment within the UK and is currently the largest\u000a      concentration of this technology worldwide. Research has involved process\u000a      optimisation, analytical simulation, materials development (including\u000a      MMCs) with UK and international partners. Application research engagement\u000a      has been in Automotive (including F1), Aerospace, Medical and Jewellery\u000a      sectors.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    University of Wolverhampton (UoW)\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Wolverhampton (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Wolverhampton","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10007166}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Research has resulted in the\u000a      development of new techniques and parameters for the processing of\u000a      existing and new alloy powders. Key researchers associated with this case\u000a      study are Professors Stanford and Kibble. Examples of international\u000a      collaborations are:\u000a    (i) Maxillofacial implants in Ti-6Al-4V, in collaboration with Professor\u000a      Brian Gabbitas (Waikato University, New Zealand); Waikato University\u000a      funded a researcher on a 6 months placement at The University. The\u000a      University provided the research input to produce the complex implant and\u000a      optimisation of material properties. The approach is unique linking design\u000a      of a mandible with a porous structure to reduce weight and stimulate\u000a      better bio- factor attachment. [1] Subsequently, Stanford was invited to\u000a      (and funded by) Waikato University (June 2012), to disseminate his\u000a      research at Waikato University, University of Auckland and the National\u000a      Titanium Development Agency. Research collaboration continues including\u000a      work on DMLS\/M of titanium aluminides.\u000a    (ii) Pioneering work on the superplastic behaviour of DMLS\/M Ti-6Al-4V. A\u000a      key insight was the realisation that the fine microstructure obtained by\u000a      the DMLS\/M process could be exploited for superplastic forming of DMLS\/M\u000a      pre-forms. Professor Ji Sik Kim (Kyungpook University S.Korea), on a 1\u000a      year sabbatical to the University, was invited to collaborate on this work\u000a      as he had research experience in SPF. The University supervised the\u000a      project built the high temperature mechanical test equipment and optimised\u000a      the DMLS\/M process and relevant metallurgy to deliver a successful\u000a      conclusion and published output. [2] Subsequently, Kibble and Stanford\u000a      were invited and funded by Kyungpook University to present and disseminate\u000a      research on DMLS\/M technology to research centres in South Korea\u000a      (September 2010). The research collaboration is continuing, including\u000a      exploring other alloy systems.\u000a    (iii) Collaboration with the University of Warwick and Red Bull F1, on\u000a      Ti-6Al-4V, has led to published work, e.g. [3]. The University provided\u000a      the DMLS\/M process development and optimisation necessary to produce thin\u000a      wall sections. The work has enabled the design and manufacture of key\u000a      valve blocks that give accurate and predictable fluid dynamics with\u000a      minimal system losses.\u000a    A major issue with DMLS\/M is residual stresses in `built' parts.\u000a      3-dimensional finite element modelling and validation has been undertaken\u000a      of the DMLS\/M process to enable the prediction of residual stresses. This\u000a      work has provided a key insight on how to minimise residual stresses\u000a      through the manipulation of laser scanning strategies [4]. This work has\u000a      produced a PhD completion, at the University (2012-13) and because of the\u000a      analytical skills developed further employment of the graduate, in a KTP\u000a      (and post KTP) with Bronx Engineering Ltd\u000a    Bio engineering research is also being undertaken on modelling and\u000a      building hip implants with functionally graded structures that approximate\u000a      the modulus of elasticity of bone [5]. The aim is to eliminate `bone\u000a      stress shielding' and implant failure. A range of cellular geometries is\u000a      being evaluated to optimise implant properties.\u000a    Knowledge gained on mechanical alloying (MA), e.g. [6] is enabling us to\u000a      carry out pioneering research on using MA techniques to produce suitable\u000a      powders to make MMCs by DMLS\/M. Conventional MA does not produce\u000a      spheroidal alloyed powder particulate and hence this material cannot be\u000a      used for DMLS\/M. However, a breakthrough at The University has led to a MA\u000a      methodology whereby spheroidal shape (+reinforcement) is retained in\u000a      powders that include Al- SiC, Ti-TiB2\/TiN\/TiC, Cu-W.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1716","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Key step 1 was the ATEP I project: (laminate technology R&amp;D).\u000d\u000a      Core income of &#163;64k (ATEP1+2), with match funding from the partners (total\u000d\u000a      ~&#163;300k) by the \"Midlands Aerospace Alliance\" and involving UTC HS\u000d\u000a      Marstons, BAe, Rolls-Royce, AJAX Tocco and UEES: Development of the\u000d\u000a      affordable diffusion bonding process.

These licensees, ranging from\u000d\u000aengineering consultancies, regulatory authorities and national laboratories, use the software to\u000d\u000aexplore the evacuation safety of complex structures, ensuring that they are safe and fit for purpose\u000d\u000athereby generating considerable consultancy income. Example projects that have used the\u000d\u000aEXODUS software include the Airbus A330-X, A340 and the initial design of the Airbus A380 [5.1].\u000d\u000aFSEG and the airEXODUS software were used in the preliminary design of the multi-billion euro\u000d\u000aA380 where it was used to assist AIRBUS in selecting a configuration for the largest passenger\u000d\u000aaircraft in the world that would meet international regulatory requirements for evacuation [3e].\u000d\u000aTowards the end of the design programme, Airbus again used FSEG and airEXODUS to de-risk\u000d\u000athe A380 full-scale evacuation certification trial, saving the manufacturer potentially millions of euro\u000d\u000aby identifying possible problems that may occur during the certification trial and ensuring that the\u000d\u000aA380 was a safe aircraft [3f, 5.1]. The A380 comfortably passed the evacuation certification trial\u000d\u000aand is an aviation success story flying with the worlds leading airlines. airEXODUS has also been\u000d\u000aused by the Canadian aircraft manufacturer BOMBARDIER to assess the evacuation capabilities\u000d\u000aof a number of their aircraft while still in the early design stages including the Dash8-400, C-Series\u000d\u000aregional jet and the T507 project, ensuring that the proposed configurations will meet international\u000d\u000aevacuation certification requirements [5.2]. airEXODUS was also recently (2010) used by JET\u000d\u000aAVIATION to demonstrate that a private VIP configured B747 and by Mitsubishi (2008) in the\u000d\u000adesign of their new regional jet, would satisfy international evacuation certification requirements\u000d\u000a[5.3]. Thus airEXODUS is used to save aircraft manufacturers tens of millions of dollars\/euros in\u000d\u000awasted development costs and lost sales revenues by ensuring that the aircraft will pass the\u000d\u000acertification trial and thereby also ensures that the design is safe for the travelling public [5.1-5.3].\u000d\u000aA unique version of buildingEXODUS is being incorporated within the security system of the\u000d\u000aPentagon as part of project Pentagon Shield. This makes use of special software features e.g.\u000d\u000aparallel computing implementation, CBRN toxicity model capability to enable faster than real time\u000d\u000adetermination of optimal evacuation routes for building occupants during an incident.\u000d\u000aBattelle\/DoD\/Hughes turned to FSEG and buildingEXODUS when US based evacuation software\u000d\u000awas found to be inadequate, potentially jeopardising a multi-million dollar project [5.4]. The\u000d\u000aEXODUS software tools provide fire engineering firms a competitive edge when bidding for\u000d\u000aprojects, allowing them to win important contracts, generating significant income for the\u000d\u000acompanies. An example is the use of buildingEXODUS, under license, by Hughes Associates to\u000d\u000aundertake an assessment of the life safety and emergency management systems within the Statue\u000d\u000aof Liberty [5.4]. Following this assessment and remodelling work, the Statue of Liberty was\u000d\u000areopened to the public by President Obama in 2009.\u000d\u000a2) Impact on Public Policy: The AASK database was developed primarily to assist the design of\u000d\u000abetter aircraft evacuation models by providing factual information on how people behave in real\u000d\u000aemergencies. It has also been used to inform international legislation on aircraft safety and airline\u000d\u000astaffing of cabin crew e.g., a paper based on AASK data providing a detailed analysis of cabin\u000d\u000acrew numbers and their effectiveness in controlling safe evacuation [3.2] was cited in an Australian\u000d\u000aSenate report as part of the Australian government debate concerning a proposal to reduce cabin\u000d\u000acrew numbers [5.5]. The research was again cited on the floor of the Australian Senate during the\u000d\u000aparliamentary debate concerning cabin crew staffing levels [5.6] and again in a House of\u000d\u000aRepresentatives Standing Committee report in 2011 [5.7]. The result has been to maintain the\u000d\u000anumber of cabin crew required on Australian passenger aircraft, ensuring that the Australian\u000d\u000aaviation industry remains amongst the safest in the world.\u000d\u000a3) Impacts on Practitioners and Professional Services: FSEG was the first to collect human\u000d\u000afactors data defining how quickly passengers respond to evacuation alarms on ships at sea during\u000d\u000asemi-unannounced drills [3.6]. This work demonstrated that the data used in the International\u000d\u000aGuidelines on Ship Evacuation Analysis in IMO MSC Circ 1033 was incorrect and could lead to an\u000d\u000aincorrect assessment of the suitability of a ship design for evacuation. The data and analysis was\u000d\u000apresented to and accepted by IMO at their Fire Protection subcommittee meeting (FP51) held in\u000d\u000aJanuary 2007 and now forms part of the revised International Guidelines document, IMO MSC Circ\u000d\u000a1238 [5.8]. The data incorporated in MSC Circ 1238 are used around the world in ship evacuation\u000d\u000aanalysis to demonstrate that passenger ships can be safely evacuated [5.9]. As already stated\u000d\u000aunder Economic impact, over the assessment period, the EXODUS suite of evacuation software\u000d\u000ahas been used by over 250 licensees in 32 countries and so has become a standard engineering\u000d\u000adesign tool for safety analysis, used by fire safety engineers around the world. The software is\u000d\u000atherefore having an impact on the engineering profession around the world [5.4].\u000d\u000a4) Impacts on Society, Culture and Creativity: FSEG research into evacuation has engaged the\u000d\u000apublic, informing them of our research, educating them concerning risks associated with fire and\u000d\u000aevacuation and how they can minimise those risks, as well as informing future industrial partners\u000d\u000aand policy makers. This has been achieved through several high profile TV and Radio programmes\u000d\u000awhich have featured our research such as the BBC `Horizon' documentary based on FSEG fire and\u000d\u000aevacuation research, entitled, \"How to Survive a Disaster\" (first broadcast 10\/03\/09 on BBC1\u000d\u000a(http:\/\/bbc.in\/15noerY) which attracted a 1.7 million viewer audience representing 7% of the\u000d\u000aaudience that night (http:\/\/bit.ly\/17BHAJx)). The concepts presented in this programme were\u000d\u000aconsidered so important; the US news programme ABC Nightline featured a story on its nightly\u000d\u000anews programme broadcast on 22\/12\/09 which drew on much of the material presented in the\u000d\u000aHorizon programme [5.10]. Other programs include the Channel 4 documentary \"Terror at Sea\"\u000d\u000a(first broadcast 31\/01\/12 on Channel 4, (http:\/\/bit.ly\/17BIXHU)) which followed the sinking of the\u000d\u000aCosta Concordia. Prof Galea commented on evacuation issues associated with large cruise ships\u000d\u000a(the programme attracted a massive 3.4 million viewers (http:\/\/bit.ly\/17BJjP1)) which was followed\u000d\u000aup by an interview on BBC Radio 4 Today (4 March 2012, (http:\/\/bit.ly\/GAKPrP)).\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThe Fire Safety Engineering Groups (FSEG's) research related to human behaviour associated\u000d\u000awith evacuation and evacuation modelling is saving lives because it is used to design safer aircraft,\u000d\u000aships and buildings.

Its aim was to\u000d\u000adevelop a modelling tool that could predict the behaviour of passengers subjected to a post-crash\u000d\u000afire. This early work led to the development of the world's first microscopic evacuation model that\u000d\u000acoupled fine grained spatial resolution, human behaviour, toxicological models and fire hazard data\u000d\u000a[3.1] - an early prototype of the airEXODUS software. The continuing research was supported\u000d\u000athrough a series of research grants from the EPSRC [3a] and UK CAA [3b] aimed at developing\u000d\u000athe prototype into a practical engineering tool. The EPSRC project and a CAA project were aimed at\u000d\u000aimproving the understanding of human behaviour in aviation accidents. This consisted of extracting\u000d\u000asurvivor accounts of evacuation experience from aircraft crashes and the development of a relational\u000d\u000adatabase of these experiences &#8212; AASK database [3.2]. This study identified that the introduction of\u000d\u000acomplex human behaviour was essential if evacuation models were to accurately predict evacuation\u000d\u000adynamics. The second CAA project consisted of extracting human performance data from video\u000d\u000afootage of evacuation certification trials &#8212; enabling human performance during evacuation to be\u000d\u000aquantified. This work resulted in the publication of many papers quantifying and explaining human\u000d\u000abehaviour in aviation accidents and formed the basis for further development of airEXODUS,\u000d\u000aensuring that the behaviour represented in the model was realistic. The third CAA funded project\u000d\u000asupported the development of the world's first practical engineering tool to simulate aircraft evacuation\u000d\u000a&#8212; airEXODUS [3.3]. This built on the early prototype and the human behaviour and performance data\u000d\u000aextracted from accidents and certification trials. Research continued to be funded through a series of\u000d\u000aEU funded research projects [3c, 3d] and a number of research projects funded by the aircraft industry\u000d\u000a[3e. 3f].\u000d\u000aFrom 1994, FSEG research into human behaviour expanded to include the built environment. The\u000d\u000aagent based modelling concept using a fine spatial mesh that was used to simulate aircraft\u000d\u000aevacuation was adapted to simulate evacuation of people from building environments [3.4]. This\u000d\u000arequired the modelling approach to be extended to represent stairs, the behaviour of people on\u000d\u000astairs and various mathematical approaches to represent route finding, interaction with signage,\u000d\u000agroup behaviour, etc [3.5]. This research was funded through a variety of grants [3g-3i].\u000d\u000aFrom 1999 FSEG research expanded to include maritime environments. The ship environment\u000d\u000awhile similar to that of buildings poses additional challenges, such as a heeled deck, the impact of\u000d\u000alifejackets on human performance, etc. Much of this behaviour was unknown and not quantified\u000d\u000aposing significant difficulties for model development. To collect human performance data of people\u000d\u000aon inclined decks i.e. static heel\/trim, a large-scale simulator (SHEBA) was constructed in Canada\u000d\u000a[3.6]. Further research into human behaviour measured the time required by passengers on ships\u000d\u000aat sea to respond to the alarm and begin the evacuation process [3.7], an essential parameter in\u000d\u000aevacuation modelling. Data generated from this work was used in the development of\u000d\u000amaritimeEXODUS [3.5]. This research was funded through a variety of grants [3j-3k].\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"3920","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Royal Academy of Engineering"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The direct beneficiaries of the research detailed in section 2 are the\u000a      Cutty Sark Trust and the Medway Queen Preservation Society. The nation has\u000a      also benefited from our work, which has helped ensure the people can\u000a      continue to enjoy these ships, both of which demonstrate our rich maritime\u000a      heritage.\u000a    1) Economic impact:\u000a    The results and recommendations arising from CNMPA's research work,\u000a      detailed in the reports made available to the trust, were implemented\u000a      throughout 2008-2011. Our work in 2006 led to a change in direction of how\u000a      the ship would be supported. This saved an estimated &#163;500,000 (the cost if\u000a      the original option had progressed further) in particular during the\u000a      period from 2008 onwards, when detailed planning for lifting and\u000a      supporting the ship was put into practice. Our research helped minimise\u000a      the risk associated with both disassembly (2006-2007) and reassembly\u000a      (2008-2011) of the ship. It also reduced the time in planning the\u000a      procedures for disassembly and reassembly.\u000a    The overall cost of saving the Cutty Sark for the nation was &#163;50M of\u000a      which the Heritage Lottery awarded &#163;25m. Scientific underpinning provided\u000a      by the university was instrumental in securing Lottery funding, and\u000a      structural health monitoring work by the university was a condition of the\u000a      award. An aim was to minimise the amount of new conservation work required\u000a      for at least 50 years: we developed a decision support tool for\u000a      post-restoration maintenance of the vessel, ensuring that potential future\u000a      losses due to structural problems with the ship have been mitigated. Our\u000a      contribution has also secured local jobs for 20 people who now work on the\u000a      Cutty Sark. This international icon is helping to boost tourism which\u000a      plays such an important role in the UK economy, adding &#163;12Bn per year to\u000a      GDP and supporting over 195,000 jobs.\u000a    Ian Diamond, Chair of Research Councils UK, following the team being\u000a      awarded the Times Higher Education Outstanding Research Team of the year\u000a      (2009), said of the university's contribution: \"A rare combination of\u000a        outstanding research and real impact in an area not normally noted for\u000a        engineering. The application to cultural heritage will have an enormous\u000a        impact on the UK's long term economy.\" (http:\/\/bit.ly\/15UsbEg)\u000a    The work on the Cutty Sark has exciting implications as our research is\u000a      generic, and could be used to conserve and maintain other heritage\u000a      structures. The trust has provided an introduction to a national network\u000a      of maritime conservation projects, leading to new application in the &#163;5M\u000a      restoration of the Medway Queen, a survivor of the Dunkirk evacuation.\u000a      This was a unique ship - fast and light for her day. She was not built to\u000a      the design rules of the day and there are no modern rules for constructing\u000a      riveted ships - hence the need for a computational analysis. Our work\u000a      ensured the contractors' riveting process was safe, and able to withstand\u000a      the stresses the plating in the ship's hull imposed on the rivets. We also\u000a      identified safe operating conditions in terms of sea conditions and\u000a      passenger loading, and the response of the ship's hull to the placement of\u000a      heavy critical machinery. This helped the restoration programme\u000a      consultant, a naval architect, ensure the riveted ship would be\u000a      structurally sound. The Medway Queen Museum is now open in Gillingham,\u000a      providing training in maritime conservation skills and employing 24\u000a      people.\u000a    2) Impact on culture and society:\u000a    Today the masts of the Cutty Sark stand tall once again over Greenwich.\u000a      The Queen reopened the much loved icon in April 2012 and by February 2013\u000a      over 320,000 people had visited, half from overseas. The aesthetic\u000a      pleasure of seeing the ship in that setting and the cultural identity it\u000a      gives are priceless. No other group has applied this kind of engineering -\u000a      sophisticated computational and numerical models which are based on\u000a      detailed physical analysis of failure mechanisms - to the conservation of\u000a      heritage artefacts. The project has become a popular case study for\u000a      school, undergraduate and postgraduate students, for instance through\u000a      annual Royal Institution master classes and IEEE events. Wide media\u000a      coverage, and prizes awarded to the group, attest to the reputation of the\u000a      project regionally and nationally. These include the Times Higher\u000a        Education Award for Outstanding Research Team (2009) and Best\u000a        Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) Project for London (2008).\u000a    The London Development Agency, following the Knowledge Transfer Awards\u000a      2008, said: \"The university's experts are using sophisticated computer\u000a        models to work out how to dismantle and reassemble the fire-damaged\u000a        Cutty Sark. They are now using their knowledge to understand how the\u000a        Cutty Sark's structure will age over the next 100 years. The university\u000a        is developing the technology to be used on other ships, protecting\u000a        maritime heritage across the globe.\" (http:\/\/bit.ly\/17XqIKh)\u000a    The Medway Queen belongs to the national core collection of historic\u000a      vessels. The aim was for the paddle steamer to gain license to sail once\u000a      again, ie to meet latest maritime standards (Maritime Coastal Agency) yet\u000a      be rebuilt using the original 1924 design of a fully riveted structure (http:\/\/bit.ly\/16kKoNU). Our results\u000a      ensured that safety requirements were met and the ship sailed from\u000a      Bristol, where she was rebuilt, home to Gillingham. In fact the amount of\u000a      detail we provided goes beyond what is usually required for MCA\u000a      certification and could possibly inform future MCA standards for heritage\u000a      ships. The Medway Queen Preservation Society aims to exhibit the vessel at\u000a      the 75th Dunkirk Anniversary in 2015, as well exhibiting at\u000a      ports around north-west Europe.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Centre for Numerical Modelling and Process Analysis (CNMPA) was asked\u000a      in 2004 to apply its expertise in computational reliability engineering,\u000a      usually used in high technology manufacturing, to help save the Cutty Sark\u000a      ship and in 2010 to help restore the Medway Queen.

It predicts how multi-component,\u000a      multi-material systems will behave in myriad situations including\u000a      variations in temperature, pressure, vibration, humidity, and over time.\u000a      In 2004 the Cutty Sark Trust turned to the university for help based on\u000a      our expertise in modelling composite structures such as printed circuit\u000a      boards [3.4]. The magnificent Victorian tea clipper, moored in Greenwich,\u000a      had fallen into such poor repair she was at risk of collapse. The ship\u000a      needed to be dismantled and there was only one chance to get it right.\u000a      Supported by the trust and the Knowledge Transfer Partnership funding, the\u000a      centre applied its expertise to aid the trust in saving this maritime\u000a      treasure for the nation.\u000a    The team made a digital model of the Cutty Sark which factored in the\u000a      materials' aged state and the hull's iron and timber makeup. Existing\u000a      techniques such as photogrammetry and data from laser scans were used to\u000a      digitise the ship's structure; acoustic and visual data to obtain data on\u000a      material loss due to corrosion; and finite element analysis to predict\u000a      structural behaviour. The finite element model required development of a\u000a      new shell element formulation to accurately capture the composite\u000a      structure's behaviour, made of iron and timber planks [3.1]. The main\u000a      feature of the above approach is the evaluation of the in-plane and\u000a      bending stiffness of the composite hull structure. This approach was\u000a      validated against experimental data at the university engineering\u000a      laboratory, where a small prototype of the ship's hull was built and\u000a      tested. Using this finite element model the team was able to predict\u000a      detailed structural behaviour of the ship (eg deformation and stresses)\u000a      for all the conservation scenarios being suggested by the trust.\u000a    The initial phase of the project was to dismantle the ship in order to\u000a      mend and preserve each component. What CNMPA was able to do, by using the\u000a      finite element model detailed above, was demonstrate what would happen in\u000a      14 different scenarios and give the trust confidence that it was choosing\u000a      the safest way to dismantle the ship before a single plank had been\u000a      lifted. CNMPA also applied its computational technologies to the ship's\u000a      reassembly. We were able to help the trust realise its ambition to raise\u000a      the Cutty Sark above ground in order to create a museum space, and allow\u000a      the public to walk beneath the magnificent sculptural hull. In theory our\u000a      research outputs suggested this would be possible but could it be\u000a      delivered in practice? Our initial work investigated the option of using a\u000a      sling to support the ship, but our results showed that this would impose\u000a      unacceptably high significant stresses on the iron frame [3.5]. Further\u000a      work produced a better pattern of supports which brought the stresses in\u000a      the hull down to a very low level. The trust's architect and structural\u000a      engineer used this information to develop the support structure actually\u000a      used. Our finite element model investigated the structural integrity of\u000a      the ship and this new support structure as well as the structural\u000a      behaviour of the dry dock.\u000a    Over 40 internal reports (http:\/\/bit.ly\/H4JlGh)\u000a      were generated from our research efforts which helped guide the engineers\u000a      throughout the conservation programme (2006-2011). Unfortunately in 2007\u000a      the ship suffered a major fire which delayed the conservation project by\u000a      14 months. We continued to work with the chief engineer and the trust\u000a      throughout 2008-2009 to assess the structural behaviour of the fire\u000a      damaged ship, particularly in its planned new support structure.\u000a    The team has also developed a novel decision support tool to help\u000a      maintain the vessel, using Bayesian belief networks with data\u000a      from a physics model of corrosion, and statistical analysis of sensor data\u000a      for diagnostics and prognostics of the corroding iron structure [3.3].\u000a      Working in collaboration with the University of Portsmouth, it created\u000a      sensors that gather data on corrosion rates, and combined that with\u000a      environmental data to demonstrate the use of Bayesian belief networks as\u000a      part of a prognostics and health management system.\u000a    In 2011 CNPMA was approached by Medway Queen Preservation Society to use\u000a      the experience it gained on modelling the structural behaviour of the\u000a      Cutty Sark to help restore the Medway Queen (the Heroine of Dunkirk) to\u000a      its original 1924 design. A novel approach, never used before in such\u000a      detail to model the restoration of a riveted hull historic ship, used a\u000a      finite element model for assessing the strength of the rivets and hull\u000a      plates against a set of defined safety factors [3.2, 3.6]. Our assessment\u000a      on rivet strength for different sea and passenger loading conditions was\u000a      validated using tensile tests on samples at the university.\u000a    Key staff\u000a    Professor Chris Bailey - Director of the Computational Mechanics and\u000a      Reliability Group within CNMPA and project manager; Dr Stoyan Stoyanov; Dr\u000a      Yasmine Rosunally - PhD student, now lecturer at University of West\u000a      London, Dr Pushpa Rajaguru, and Professor Peter Mason - Chief Engineer,\u000a        Cutty Sark Trust (2004-2009), Visiting Professor, University of\u000a        Greenwich (2009-present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6340","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Two strategic research challenges were identified for the research at\u000a      Leeds in 2000:\u000a    \u000a      To create regenerative biological scaffolds for cardiovascular tissue\u000a        repairs such as heart valves and cardiovascular patches;\u000a      To create regenerative biological scaffolds for the repair of thicker,\u000a        three-dimensional musculoskeletal soft tissue such as ligaments, tendons\u000a        and menisci.\u000a    \u000a    The unique approach taken at Leeds has generated tissue-specific\u000a      biological scaffolds and patents for each tissue repair application. This\u000a      contrasts with previous commercial biological scaffold approaches that\u000a      developed a single scaffold material with one set of properties and\u000a      applied it to many different applications. Failure to match site- and\u000a      tissue-specific properties can result in suboptimal physical performance\u000a      and regenerative response.\u000a    The commercial impact within the REF period has been enabled by\u000a      protecting the IP generated through the underpinning research in a number\u000a      of patents. The first patent [A] protected the basic process and\u000a      demonstrated its application in heart valves and pericardium. The patent\u000a      was filed prior to publication of the original research [1, 2] and is\u000a      supported by further research [3].

Clinical trials were undertaken in 2009 on the\u000a      first commercial product, the dCELL&#174; Vascular Patch, which was\u000a      CE marked as a Class III medical device and launched as a commercial\u000a      product in autumn 2010 [D]. The company was floated on the Alternative\u000a      Investment Market (AIM) as Tissue Regenix Group (TRG) in 2010 and, in\u000a      2012, raised further funds (&#163;25M) to support development of a wider range\u000a      of commercial products for cardiovascular and musculoskeletal\u000a      applications. TRG`s market CAP, at a share price of 11p, is &#163;70M (2012\u000a      valuation) and it is investing over &#163;32M of private capital in new product\u000a      development, currently employing 35 people [D,E,F]. The University of\u000a      Leeds is a shareholder and investor in TRG.

Fisher in this UoA and Professor E. Ingham of UOA 5\u000a      at the University of Leeds. Fisher led the bioengineering aspects\u000a      of the research and is Principal Investigator on the grants (i)-(xi)\u000a      listed in section 3. Before 2000, soft tissue repair and replacement\u000a      primarily involved the use of synthetic biomaterials, chemically\u000a      cross-linked and inert bioprosthetic devices, autograft or allogeneic\u000a      donor tissues. Although these approaches are still used extensively, they\u000a      all have limitations.\u000a    Research in this area at the University of Leeds started in 2000. The\u000a      initial aim was to test the hypothesis that it was possible to develop a\u000a      regenerative biological scaffold, which, upon implantation, would\u000a      regenerate with the patient's own cells and provide tissue-specific,\u000a      multi-scale physical architecture. The objective was to develop a scaffold\u000a      to provide multi-scale biomechanical properties and function at the\u000a      macroscopic and cellular levels to support physiological function. The\u000a      scaffolds are designed to transform macro-scale physiological forces to\u000a      appropriate tissue specific micro-(cellular)-level strains to drive\u000a      appropriate cell differentiation.\u000a    The approach taken was to re-engineer native tissues through the\u000a      development of biochemical processes that removed the cells, cell\u000a      fragments and DNA to make them immunologically compatible without\u000a      compromising the tissue structure and architecture. The unique processes\u000a      created acellular biological scaffolds that retained the biomechanical\u000a      function and properties of the native tissue. The novelty of the process\u000a      was its use of very low concentrations of a detergent (sodium dodecyl\u000a      sulphate) and proteinase inhibitors in order to protect and maintain the\u000a      properties of the extracellular tissue matrix, coupled with a complete\u000a      wash-out of residual chemicals. The multidisciplinary research expertise\u000a      of the team enabled evaluation of both the biomechanical and biological\u000a      properties of the resultant regenerative scaffolds.\u000a    The initial scientific investigations in 2002 focused on heart valve\u000a      tissue, which comprises of a complex three-dimensional structure of thin\u000a      membranes [1, 2]. The research was funded by a local charity (grant i),\u000a      with clinical collaborators K. Watterson, Cardiac Surgeon at the Leeds\u000a      Teaching Hospitals Trust, and J. Kearney of NHS Blood &amp; Transplant\u000a      Tissue Services.\u000a    Following the initial proof of scientific principle on heart valves,\u000a      research was then pursued with the backing of substantial EPSRC funding,\u000a      including a prestigious Portfolio Partnership Award for work on tissue\u000a      replacement and regeneration (grant iii). The research focused on\u000a      cardiovascular and musculoskeletal tissues and involved:\u000a    \u000a      Investigation of the functional biomechanics in 2005 [3] and\u000a        recellularisation of scaffolds for heart valve applications\u000a      The development of a bioprocess that allowed the development of the\u000a        dCELL&#174; vascular patch [4] in 2006\u000a      The development of further bioprocesses and the dCELL&#174; biological\u000a        scaffolds for ligament and meniscus repair [5, 6] in 2007 and 2008.\u000a    \u000a    The excellence of this research has been recognised by several external\u000a      awards: Fisher and Ingham, ERC Advanced Award (grant xi); Fisher,\u000a      CBE for services to Biomedical Engineering (2011); and the Queen's\u000a      Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education to the University of\u000a      Leeds, for its contribution to medical engineering.\u000a    Research Team\u000a      Professor J.

Specifically it has:\u000a    \u000a      Supported the design and co-development of the simulation systems;\u000a      Commissioned, evaluated and validated new simulation systems;\u000a      Produced control and reference data over 5 billion cycles of reference\u000a        data.\u000a      Provided training and standard operating procedures for users and\u000a        customers\u000a      Published journal papers on the simulation systems company web site.\u000a    \u000a    The simulation facility established in this UoA has over eighty stations\u000a      offering full-joint simulation in Class 2 clean rooms and is believed to\u000a      be the largest academic facility in the world [1,2,3,4]. These simulators\u000a      have been used to support product development, to assess performance and\u000a      evaluate safety and reliability of joint replacements.\u000a    We have worked in partnership with industry to research, invent and\u000a      develop novel lower wearing bearings for the hip. The ceramic-on-metal hip\u000a      [6] developed with DePuy [C,D] and the tougher and lower wearing [2]\u000a      ceramic-matrix-composite bearings [E] developed with DePuy and Mathys were\u000a      both major strides in this area. In the knee, the research [4] has\u000a      supported the development and adoption of the DePuy Sigma\u000a      rotating-platform knee [F] and a new low-conforming partial knee [G].\u000a    The advanced hip simulation systems have also been used to quantify the\u000a      increase in wear in larger diameter metal-on-metal hip replacement systems\u000a      due to edge loading [H]. This provided evidence that informed the\u000a      subsequent decision to discontinue their clinical use.\u000a    Economic impact\u000a    Demand for pre-clinical joint simulation systems has increased\u000a      substantially since 2007, following the reclassification of joint\u000a      replacements as Class 3 devices. The regulatory environment now requires\u000a      most hip and knee joint replacements to undergo pre-clinical tribological\u000a      simulation testing before entering clinical use.\u000a    Statement [B] confirms that: Simulation Solutions have increased their\u000a      annual turnover to &#163;2M\/year and now employ 20 people to develop and\u000a      manufacture hip joint simulation systems; the company's joint simulation\u000a      systems are sold around the world, in China, India, Australia and Europe\u000a      and the company is the market leader outside of North America.\u000a    Economic impact has been made through support for Simulation Solutions\u000a      customers in the use of the technology. This is delivered through the\u000a      licensing of standard operating procedures and a training-support package\u000a      from the University to customers. One example is an agreement between the\u000a      University of Leeds, Simulation Solutions and the Chinese Food &amp; Drug\u000a      Administration (CFDA) that has led to the installation of Simulation\u000a      Solution simulators in CFDA laboratories in Tianjin [I].\u000a    Economic impact has also been delivered through the University's\u000a      ISO-accredited research laboratory. This facility has supplied contract\u000a      research services to industry and supported companies in developing\u000a      products to meet new regulations. Not all implant manufacturers have joint\u000a      simulation systems. This is particularly true of small- to medium-sized\u000a      enterprises. The University has supported new product development in\u000a      orthopaedic companies including Mathys, JRI, Ceramtec, Ceramconcept, and\u000a      Corin. Collaboration with Mathys has supported the development of the new\u000a      ceramic-matrix-composite ceramic-on-ceramic hip for clinical use [J].\u000a    The 12-year-long strategic research partnership with DePuy [K] has\u000a      supported the development of improved bearings with lower wear. Statement\u000a      [L] confirms that this has helped DePuy protect its market share and meet\u000a      the expectations of high-demand patients [L]. Some figures describing the\u000a      extent of the impact of the research at Leeds are:\u000a    \u000a      Approximately 10,000 ceramic-on-metal hips implanted worldwide. There\u000a        has been a 97% success rate at five years for 1,500 hips in the UK\u000a        registry\u000a      Over 300,000 ceramic femoral heads sold and implanted outside of the\u000a        USA since 2008, for which the University of Leeds has received a royalty\u000a        payment from DePuy [M]\u000a    \u000a    Statement [L] from DePuy confirms that our advanced research methods have\u000a      been adopted by industry and that 15 DePuy R&amp;D staff have been trained\u000a      in Leeds. The adverse hip simulation methods and edge loading of the head\u000a      on the rim of cup and advanced knee simulation methods are used in DePuy\u000a      company testing laboratories in the UK and USA.\u000a    Health impact\u000a    Young, active and high-demand patients with improved lower wearing\u000a      prostheses benefit from extended active working lives. The reduction in\u000a      wear-related failures and revision operations provide benefits to\u000a      healthcare providers. The research has led to the collaborative\u000a      development of improved prostheses [C,D,E,F,G], following clinical trials\u000a      [D], this has resulted in lower wearing joint replacements used by\u000a      hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This UoA has developed the largest independent simulation laboratory in\u000a      the world for pre-clinical evaluation of the wear of artificial joints,\u000a      which has been used to develop and commercialise novel pre-clinical\u000a      simulation systems for joint replacements, in partnership with Simulation\u000a      Solutions Ltd.

Fisher\u000a      in this UoA and Professor E. Ingham of UoA 5 at the University of Leeds. Fisher\u000a      is Principal Investigator on the grants [i]-[xii] listed in Section 3.\u000a    The need to develop lower wearing bearings for total joint replacements\u000a      for younger, more active patients emerged during the 1990s. Laboratory\u000a      joint simulators were developed to undertake research, support new product\u000a      development and conduct pre-clinical testing.\u000a    In 1997, this UoA initiated a partnership with Prosim (now Simulation\u000a      Solutions Ltd) with the aim of developing joint simulation systems that\u000a      could be used for their own research, by other research laboratories and\u000a      by implant manufacturers. The partnership, which has lasted over 15 years,\u000a      has brought together the University's research expertise in joint\u000a      replacement, biomechanics and tribology with the company's expertise in\u000a      control systems, robotics and commercialisation.\u000a    The initial collaborative research project with Simulation Solutions\u000a      [grant i] led to the development of a ten-station hip simulator, which was\u000a      used in studies of polyethylene wear in acetabular cups. The University's\u000a      tribological research defined new input wave forms for the simulator that\u000a      were subsequently adopted by the ISO Standard in 2000. The research\u000a      validated the simulator design and generated reference data for standard\u000a      polyethylene cups [1] and extended the simulation methods to replicate a\u000a      wider range of clinical conditions [2].\u000a    The researchers expanded their collaborative research with Simulation\u000a      Solutions [ii, iii] to develop the first knee joint simulator that enabled\u000a      control of the AP axis and IR axis in either force or displacement mode\u000a      [3]. This system was used to investigate the effect of kinematics and\u000a      design on polyethylene wear in the knee [4]. A fifth active axis, an\u000a      abduction adduction torque, was subsequently added, which generated\u000a      femoral condylar lift off motion and resulted in an increase in wear [5].\u000a    The simulation systems have been applied in collaborative tribological\u000a      research with industry to develop lower wearing, longer lasting hip joints\u000a      [grants v, vi] between 2000 and 2008. The researchers were the first to\u000a      show that alumina ceramic bearings produced stripe wear when subjected to\u000a      edge loading and showed that ceramic-matrix-composite ceramic-on-ceramic\u000a      bearings had lower wear under these adverse conditions than alumina\u000a      ceramic-on-ceramic bearings [2] in 2003. The researchers developed and\u000a      patented the novel differential-hardness ceramic-on-metal bearing, which\u000a      had lower wear compared to metal-on-metal bearings [6] in 2001.\u000a    In the knee, the researchers defined, in collaboration with DePuy, the\u000a      mechanism of reduced polyethylene wear in the rotating-platform knee\u000a      design, resulting from the decoupling of motions and reduction in cross\u000a      shear [4] in 2005. In fixed bearing knees, the team's tribological\u000a      research [viii, x] has shown that polyethylene wear is dependent on\u000a      surface area and demonstrated a reduction in wear in low-conforming knees.\u000a    The excellence of this research has resulted in Fisher's Presidential\u000a      guest lectures at the American Hip Society and American Knee Society, and\u000a      the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in 2011 to\u000a      the University of Leeds.\u000a    Research Team\u000a    Professor J.

In parallel, the Team's fundamental studies have made major\u000a      contributions to reductions in fire and explosion hazards throughout the\u000a      automotive, aviation, and energy sectors.\u000a    Energy efficient engines.\u000a    Engines with high burn rates are generally cleaner and more efficient,\u000a      provided knock is avoided. As a result of extensive collaborations with\u000a      Jaguar Land-Rover (JLR), Lotus, Rolls-Royce (R-R), and VW, the Leeds\u000a      experimental and modelling insights into burning rates have had a\u000a      widespread influence on reciprocating engine and gas turbine design. The\u000a      R-R collaboration led to improved igniters and prevention of high-altitude\u000a      flame-out in aero-turbines, as well as the prevention of auto-ignition and\u000a      flash-back in land-based turbines. A long term collaboration with JLR [A]\u000a      and, latterly, GE Precision Engineering [B] has led to improved control of\u000a      fuel\/air mixing, ignition, burn rates, and knock suppression, together\u000a      with reductions in the uncontrolled variations in working cycles. The\u000a      Leeds computer modelling code was incorporated by JLR into its internal\u000a      engine system modelling packages [A]. These fundamental improvements in\u000a      the design and engineering of the companies' engines [A,B] have\u000a      contributed to their development, in the UK, of commercially very\u000a      successful, high pressure, knock-free, turbo-charged, engines. These are\u000a      characterised by their reduced size, yet with higher power, combined with\u000a      consequent impressive improvements in efficiency and reductions in\u000a      emissions. Both of these savings amount to up to approximately 30% of\u000a      previous values [A]. Since 2010, collaborations to this end were\u000a      consolidated in the UltraBoost project [vi], which included JLR, GE\u000a      Precision, Shell, the Universities of Bath and Imperial College, with\u000a      Leeds making its major contributions in the key area of\u000a      carefully-controlled high pressure combustion, just short of the knock\u000a      limit. JLR has invested &#163;355M to manufacture the engines into production\u000a      [C] and has created 10,700 new jobs in UK since 2008. Data in [D] indicate\u000a      the huge savings from even a 1% improvement in efficiency.\u000a    Energy efficient fuels\u000a    The detailed observations and modelling of high-pressure combustion and\u000a      auto-ignition, not only showed the widely used Octane Number criteria to\u000a      be misleading for modern engines, but it also led to the development of\u000a      alternative design approaches [E]. These, combined with fuel tests in the\u000a      Leeds bomb, supported Shell's development of a new vehicle fuel formula\u000a      with increased burn rate and minimised auto-ignition [F]. This world-wide\u000a      FuelSave range, launched in 2010, improved engine efficiency by up to 2%,\u000a      with consequent reduction in carbon emissions. Specialist support was\u000a      given also to the development of Shell's Formula One fuels and\u000a      fuel-blending laws with Sasol.\u000a    Fuel explosions &#8212; contributions to inquiries and safety\u000a        recommendations\u000a    Following the vapour cloud explosion at Buncefield oil storage terminal\u000a      in 2005, Bradley was asked to advise the late Lord Newton's Major\u000a      Incident Investigation Board [G] into the Buncefield disaster, through\u000a      membership of its Explosion Mechanism Group. Findings from the Leeds Team,\u000a      along with input from others members of the expert group, were used to\u000a      explain the cause and damage from this huge explosion [H]. From this\u000a      assessment of the explosion dynamics, the Inquiry recommended specific\u000a      measures to prevent a recurrence [G]. The introduction of new safety\u000a      standards, site layouts and technologies [F], informed in part from a\u000a      scientific understanding of the explosion, has had a significant impact\u000a      for the UK. The new safety measures will have helped to avert a similar\u000a      explosion which had a total economic cost of around &#163;1billion [G]. The\u000a      implementation cost of all the recommendations was calculated at\u000a      approximately &#163;82M, with an estimated benefit through the reduction of\u000a      risk \"in the region of &#163;162million\" [G].\u000a    Jet-Flames\u000a    The Team's jet-flame model has been used in the important area of flare\u000a      design by Shell [F] and validated in tests at the South West Research\u000a      Institute. The Team's correlation of jet-flame data, with parameters drawn\u000a      from the computer model, is invaluable for estimating the magnitude of oil\u000a      field blow-outs, and designing non-polluting flares. After Bradley's\u000a      earlier involvement in the Concorde fire Inquiry, Qinetiq asked him to use\u000a      the Leeds jet-flame model to quantify upstream fuel leaks from the\u000a      observed sizes of the fire plume from the Nimrod aircraft over\u000a      Afghanistan. This confirmed magnitudes of fuel leakage after in-flight\u000a      re-fueling. The subsequent Haddon-Cave Report [I] resulted in the Nimrod\u000a      being withdrawn from service, averting the possibility of further crashes\u000a      and potential loss of life.\u000a    Impact on Society, Culture and Creativity\u000a    The stretched turbulent flame codes are freely available and are being\u000a      used by other groups. They are embodied in the THOR fluid dynamics code of\u000a      the Daresbury Laboratory, developed in collaboration with the Leeds group.\u000a      The Team contributed to BBC programmes, for radio on oil field blow-outs\u000a      and for TV on the Olympic flame (2012). The findings on the limitations of\u000a      Octane Numbers have had international repercussions throughout the\u000a      automotive and oil industries.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Experimental research and computer modelling in the School of Mechanical\u000a      Engineering have been applied by engine and oil companies to reduce fuel\u000a      consumption and noxious emissions.

These have resulted in better understanding of\u000a      the dynamics and mechanisms of controlled combustion (and uncontrolled\u000a      explosions). New insights have been widely accepted and applied, resulting\u000a      in improved fuels and better control of combustion in engines and\u000a      turbines, with safety features to prevent explosions and detonations.\u000a    Burn rates\u000a      Between 1993 and 2012, Sheppard, Bradley, Gaskell, Lawes and Burluka\u000a      conducted rigorous mathematical modelling and experimentation on flame\u000a      front propagation and auto-ignition, under different conditions, in a\u000a      number of collaborations, with Alstom [iii], British Gas [i], Jaguar Land-Rover\u000a\u0009  [iii,iv,vi], Lotus [iii], Mahle [vii], VW [ii], Ricardo [ii],\u000a      Rolls-Royce [i,iii], Sasol [viii] and Shell [i,iii,iv,vi,viii]. They\u000a      discovered new correlations between the parameters which influence the\u000a      velocity of turbulent burning, enabling the Team to model high pressure\u000a      combustion scenarios and predict the onset of knocking with greater\u000a      accuracy [2-4, 6]. The studies employed a unique facility, designed and\u000a      developed by the Team: a fan-stirred explosion bomb incorporating laser\u000a      diagnostics, pressure transducers, and high speed photography [2]. Burluka\u000a      and Lawes improved understanding of two-phase mixing and burning\u000a      of liquid sprays and Lawes found fuel-rich aerosols burned much\u000a      faster than had been suggested previously, indicative of an additional\u000a      instability [4].\u000a    High pressure combustion\u000a      Although more fuel-efficient, a high burn rate in spark-ignition engines\u000a      can lead to high pressure engine `knock' &#8212; caused by auto-ignition at\u000a      reactant `hot spots'. The consequent over-pressures are highly detrimental\u000a      and can even destroy an engine. The generation of hot spots in engine\u000a      auto- ignition and the propagation of the reaction fronts were studied\u000a      throughout the period by Sheppard and Burluka [3].\u000a      Parallel direct numerical simulations embodying detailed chemical kinetics\u000a      were initiated by Bradley with Morley, of Shell, and Gu, of the\u000a      Daresbury Laboratory. These simulations, combined with extensive engine\u000a      research, revealed that increased pressure can create particularly\u000a      damaging and spasmodic `super-knock' [6]. Since 2008, collaborations with\u000a      both Shell and Aramco, revealed \"super-knock\" to be associated with an\u000a      unexpected gas-phase pre-ignition, an important discovery which has led to\u000a      studies on the auto-ignition characteristics of lubricating oil [6].\u000a    The Leeds\/Shell collaboration demonstrated fundamental limitations in the\u000a      international criterion for engine knock &#8212; the octane number &#8212; for the\u000a      higher temperatures and pressures in modern engines. The simulations\u000a      showed that the complex relationships between the different physicho-chemical\u000a\u0009  parameters can be combined into a single dimensionless group,\u000a      indicative of the severity of hot spot pressure pulses. Sharpe\u000a      [5:v], showed the group was also indicative of the stability of detonation\u000a      fronts. This gave rise to a new universal parameter, the Chi-number, now\u000a      being adopted rapidly by the wider community.\u000a    Jet-flames and explosion risk\u000a      The stretched turbulent premixed flame model of Bradley and Gaskell\u000a      [1] was further developed, to explore the structural detail of large\u000a      jet-flames.

Gaskell, Summers and Thompson\u000d\u000a      created new computer models for roll coating systems [1,2], which\u000d\u000a      predicted when recirculating flow and wetting line locations in the\u000d\u000a      coating fluids lead to coating defects, enabling end-users to prevent\u000d\u000a      defects and improve product quality.

Most large transport aircraft fly at the so-called transonic\u000d\u000a      speeds (high subsonic near the speed of sound). However, in this transonic\u000d\u000a      region there is a key problem of drag due to shock wave formation on the\u000d\u000a      wing. The 3D contoured shock control bump developed by the research group\u000d\u000a      [R3] substantially reduces this drag.\u000d\u000a    This development has had a significant influence on the design programmes\u000d\u000a      in the aerospace industry, in particular Airbus, as evidenced by the\u000d\u000a      following supporting statement [S2]:\u000d\u000a    \"Due to the research undertaken by the Sheffield Team, our understanding\u000d\u000a      of the behavior of the shock control bumps for practical application onto\u000d\u000a      our aircraft wings, in particular in their robustness for different flight\u000d\u000a      conditions and for laminar wings with different transition locations, has\u000d\u000a      improved significantly.

In general, these\u000d\u000a      computations require: a mesh to formulate the geometry of the physical\u000d\u000a      problem, a solver to predict the flow; and an optimisation or design\u000d\u000a      procedure that can interact with the computational model to achieve a\u000d\u000a      desired performance. The impact was underpinned by research in all three\u000d\u000a      of these areas:\u000d\u000a    (1) Meshing techniques: Delaunay mapping, buffer layer and zipper\u000d\u000a        layer methods\u000d\u000a    Between 2003 and 2006, Professor Ning Qin (Sheffield since 2003) and Dr\u000d\u000a      Xueqiang Liu (then a research student) developed an efficient moving mesh\u000d\u000a      method [R1] funded by a Sino-British Fellowship. A moving mesh method is\u000d\u000a      crucial for efficient design optimisation and for fluid structure\u000d\u000a      interactions when the geometry deforms. Instead of using spring analogy\u000d\u000a      based moving mesh methods, where partial differential equations are\u000d\u000a      solved, the Delaunay-based method [R1] provides a fast moving mesh method\u000d\u000a      using algebraic mapping for arbitrary topologies. Since aerodynamic\u000d\u000a      designs, such as aircraft wings or engine compressor blades, require a\u000d\u000a      large number of mesh deformations, this method can significantly shorten\u000d\u000a      the engineering design process.\u000d\u000a    The method attracted strong interest from Rolls-Royce and the Sheffield\u000d\u000a      team was invited to take part in the Centre for Fluid Mechanics Simulation\u000d\u000a      (CFMS) (2007-2010) and Strategic Investigation in Low Emission Technology\u000d\u000a      (SILOET) (2010-2012) projects funded by Rolls-Royce, in which the\u000d\u000a      methodology was exploited in the industrial design software [text removed\u000d\u000a      for publication].\u000d\u000a    The CFMS and SILOET projects led to two further underpinning research\u000d\u000a      techniques:\u000d\u000a    a) The buffer layer technique, developed by Qin, Carnie\u000d\u000a      (postdoctoral research associate), Le Moigne (postdoctoral research\u000d\u000a      associate), and Liu (research student), built on the Delaunay mapping\u000d\u000a      method to use a buffer layer of mesh to link two dissimilar structured\u000d\u000a      meshes through a divide-and-conquer approach.\u000d\u000a    b) The zipper layer technique by Qin, Wang (research\u000d\u000a      student), Carnie, and Shahpar (Rolls- Royce) [R2] improved further on\u000d\u000a      this, by linking dissimilar quality multi-block structured meshes together\u000d\u000a      without hanging nodes.\u000d\u000a    (2) Design and optimisation: 3D shock control bumps\u000d\u000a    From 2003-2008, Qin, Wong and Le Moigne invented a three-dimensional\u000d\u000a      contoured shock control device through design optimisation to reduce\u000d\u000a      transonic aircraft drag. This research was funded by BAE Systems. The\u000d\u000a      Sheffield team demonstrated the drag reduction benefits and the robustness\u000d\u000a      of the design around the design lift condition [R3, R4]. With further\u000d\u000a      funding from Airbus, the mechanism of the three dimensional shock control\u000d\u000a      was revealed through weakening the shock strength by replacing the shock\u000d\u000a      wave with compression waves so as to reduce the entropy increase. The\u000d\u000a      device was then parameterised and optimised for best performance.\u000d\u000a      Substantial drag reduction at high transonic speed was achieved, typically\u000d\u000a      20-30%, in comparison with the baseline wing without shock control.\u000d\u000a    (3) Solver methods: Implicit parabolised Navier-Stokes solution\u000d\u000a        (IMPNS) for supersonic\/hypersonic vortical flow and adjoint based shape\u000d\u000a        optimisation\u000d\u000a    Between 2003-2009, Qin, and DeFeo (PhD Student and then RA), further\u000d\u000a      developed a multi-block multi-grid implicit space marching method with\u000d\u000a      GMRES accelerations [R5], leading to an efficient aerodynamic analysis and\u000d\u000a      design tool for a high speed slender body with or without fins. Compared\u000d\u000a      with the conventional time marching approach, the IPNS approach results in\u000d\u000a      significant saving in computing time and memory for fast product analysis\u000d\u000a      and evaluation. Three dimensional flow fields can be solved at the\u000d\u000a      Navier-Stokes level in minutes rather than hours or days for practical\u000d\u000a      applications.

These films are very thin (typically ranging in thickness from\u000a      10nm to 100 f06dm) and have\u000a      proved difficult to measure. There are several measurement techniques that\u000a      have been used in the\u000a      past (reflected light, electrical resistance, and capacitance). Without\u000a      exception these methods\u000a      require significant changes to the machine elements being measured, for\u000a      example drilling holes\u000a      into cylinder liners, or imbedding probes into surfaces. This is\u000a      experimentally difficult to achieve,\u000a      costly, and disrupts the very thin oil films. This has meant that in the\u000a      past direct oil film\u000a      measurement is usually limited to the laboratory. Ultrasound has the key\u000a      advantage that it is non-\u000a      invasive and can measure the contact through the machine parts.\u000a    The underpinning research [R1-R3] used fundamental elastic wave mechanics\u000a      to show how an\u000a      interface responds to an ultrasonic pulse. For most practical cases the\u000a      interface can be modelled\u000a      as a simple non-linear spring; and reflection depends on the stiffness of\u000a      that spring. In turn the\u000a      spring stiffness depends on the thickness of an oil film or the amount of\u000a      solid contact. The\u000a      significance of this new approach is that simple, cheap, and small\u000a      piezo-electric sensors can be\u000a      bonded onto the outside of the component for non-invasive measurements.\u000a      This has allowed for\u000a      the first time measurements on real components in full scale industrial\u000a      machines.\u000a    Pathway from research to impact\u000a    (a) 1997-2002: Early work to develop the algorithms and instrumentation\u000a      for measuring oil films\u000a      was funded by three key EPSRC grants (GR\/S46963, GR\/M90191, GR\/L89020).\u000a      The methods\u000a      were experimentally validated on laboratory based bearings and model\u000a      contacts and\u000a      encapsulated in three pioneering papers that describe how ultrasound\u000a      responds to tribological\u000a      interfaces (i.e. oil films, asperity contact, and mixed lubrication films)\u000a      [R1-R3].\u000a    (b) 2002: IP Protection.

Aero-engines are exposed to high levels\u000a      of vibration during\u000a      service. They are safety critical components, their weight must be\u000a      minimised, and operating costs\u000a      due to maintenance and inspection operations are a key factor. These\u000a      issues mean that damping\u000a      of individual components can provide significant technical advantages.\u000a    The work began in the Department of Mechanical Engineering in 1995. It\u000a      was originally established\u000a      by Professor Tomlinson and subsequently led by Dr Rongong, both employed\u000a      by the Department\u000a      throughout. Financial support for the research was primarily provided by\u000a      Rolls-Royce. The case\u000a      study focuses on two damping technologies for aero-engines:\u000a    Syntactic foams\u000a    Our syntactic foams comprise lightweight microballoons in a polymer\u000a      matrix and were designed\u000a      as fillers for hollow titanium blades in aero-engine fan systems. They\u000a      dissipate vibration energy\u000a      when subjected to dynamic strains through viscoelasticity in the polymer\u000a      matrix. Working with\u000a      chemists at a materials supplier, Huntsman Advanced Materials, we showed\u000a      that a suitable matrix\u000a      needs:\u000a    \u000a      Constituents that have a range of molecular weights to make the\u000a        transition zone spread\u000a        over the expected operating range and hence provide damping,\u000a      Adequate cross-linking to maintain static strength and avoid creep,\u000a      Very low viscosity before cure for pumping into cavities.\u000a    \u000a    An important performance parameter of this blade filler material is the\u000a      temperature range over\u000a      which good damping characteristics are achieved. As a result of our\u000a      research, this temperature\u000a      range increased [text removed for publication].\u000a    The main role of the microballoons in the material is to reduce density.\u000a      We used a combination of\u000a      rigid glass microballoons that increased modulus at high temperature and\u000a      flexible polymer\u000a      balloons that improve pre-cure flow. This approach enabled an increase in\u000a      temperature\u000a      performance without detriment to the component assembly process. To help\u000a      select suitable\u000a      combinations of polymer and microballoons, we developed a model based on\u000a      homogenisation\u000a      theory to predict modulus and loss factors for the foam based on the\u000a      constituents [text removed\u000a        for publication].\u000a    We found that to be an effective damper, a blade filler needs to have\u000a      particular properties as it\u000a      must be deformed significantly when the blade vibrates. We developed\u000a      efficient routines to\u000a      interface with large finite element models at Rolls-Royce that would\u000a      predict vibration levels in\u000a      viscoelastic, damped structures under static and rotating conditions.\u000a      These employed\u000a      improvements to the classical Modal Strain Energy routine to minimise\u000a      errors [R3].\u000a    Lightweight material used to fill static or rotating blades must have a\u000a      high level of durability &#8212;\u000a      particularly if it is used in fan blades. We were the first to carry out\u000a      research into the slow-to-medium strain rate behaviour of syntactic foams\u000a      over a range of temperatures spanning the\u000a      transition zone [R4]. This research showed that high durability required\u000a      adjustments to the cross-linking in the polymer matrix and the properties\u000a      of the microballoons used.\u000a    Particle dampers\u000a    The material that can be used on some aero-engine components is severely\u000a      limited due to the\u000a      high operating temperature. Consequently the research at Sheffield has\u000a      also focused on damping\u000a      technologies that are compatible with this high operating temperature. One\u000a      example is the particle\u000a      damper: a container, filled with many small hard particles, which is\u000a      attached to the vibrating\u000a      structure. Their performance is affected by many parameters including\u000a      frequency, amplitude,\u000a      geometry and the type of particles. This makes them difficult to design\u000a      and optimise. In 2000,\u000a      Tomlinson, in collaboration with engineers at Rolls-Royce, started to\u000a      develop an understanding of\u000a      particle dampers using experimental methods [R5], that was subsequently\u000a      extended and\u000a      published in 2005 [R6]. An important contribution of this work was an\u000a      explanation of the role of\u000a      inter-particle friction under different conditions.

They hold\u000d\u000a      the turbine or fan blades in place, and operate under extremes of stress\u000d\u000a      and temperature. Consequently, they require exotic materials such as\u000d\u000a      titanium and nickel super alloys.\u000d\u000a    Machining of titanium and nickel super alloy discs is traditionally\u000d\u000a      constrained by tool wear, residual stress distortion and tool and part\u000d\u000a      vibration. This leads to a complex manufacturing process: multiple\u000d\u000a      operations are employed to correct the distortion from residual stresses,\u000d\u000a      and a variety of fixtures are needed to provide maximum static and dynamic\u000d\u000a      stiffness to the machining of key features.\u000d\u000a    In our approach, finite element models of the residual stress profile\u000d\u000a      were used to guide the fixture design and machining strategy, so that bulk\u000d\u000a      stresses could be removed and the consequent distortion could be corrected\u000d\u000a      for within the same operation. This requires fixtures with open access to\u000d\u000a      features, which provide less static or dynamic support.\u000d\u000a    Consequently, the research challenge is how to machine the exotic\u000d\u000a      materials when the dynamic support provided by the fixture is\u000d\u000a      substantially reduced. Breakthrough research at the University of\u000d\u000a      Sheffield addressed this via two related streams of work: process\u000d\u000a        damping, and variable helix tools.\u000d\u000a    Process damping. When machining under certain conditions, the\u000d\u000a      vibration of the system is limited by the phenomenon known as process\u000d\u000a      damping, which is associated with rubbing between the tool flank and the\u000d\u000a      just-cut workpiece surface. Process damping is particularly relevant for\u000d\u000a      difficult-to- machine metals (such as titanium and superalloys), which\u000d\u000a      require lower machining surface speeds. In reference [R1] the phenomenon\u000d\u000a      was extensively researched (partly funded by an EPSRC project\u000d\u000a      EP\/D052696\/1, 2006-2010), and the relationship between vibration and\u000d\u000a      machining feed rate was explored using numerical models and experimental\u000d\u000a      tests. This new understanding enabled us to correctly choose the feed rate\u000d\u000a      under process damped conditions. In reference [R2], the influence of tool\u000d\u000a      geometry was explored using extensive experimental testing. This enabled\u000d\u000a      us to understand how the tool edge geometry influenced the vibration, and\u000d\u000a      consequently the productivity. As a result of this research, we were able\u000d\u000a      to choose optimal machining parameters by properly exploiting the process\u000d\u000a      damping phenomenon in the machining of titanium and nickel super alloy\u000d\u000a      discs.\u000d\u000a    Variable helix cutting tools. Variable pitch and variable helix\u000d\u000a      cutting tools have been understood to reduce vibration during milling\u000d\u000a      operations. Such tools are particularly useful when machining titanium and\u000d\u000a      nickel superalloys where high spindle speed stability regions cannot be\u000d\u000a      exploited. Research undertaken by Turner [R3] and continued by Sims as\u000d\u000a      part of his EPSRC Advanced Research Fellowship (GR\/S49841\/01) [R4, R5]\u000d\u000a      produced models that can be used to guide optimum tool geometry for\u000d\u000a      stability and the selection of cutting parameters.

The new materials have allowed engines to operate at higher\u000a      temperatures compared with those using traditional wrought alloys, with\u000a      significant reduction of CO2 emission as well as much improved\u000a      structural integrity of fracture-critical turbine discs.\u000a    High-pressure turbine discs in gas turbines are one of the key components\u000a      that dictate the overall efficiency of an engine. To achieve reduced CO2\u000a      emmission, a higher overall engine efficiency is required by operating the\u000a      engine with a hotter, more thermodynamically efficient cycle. This\u000a      requires the use of new materials with better capabilities to resist\u000a      creep, fatigue and oxidation at higher operational temperatures. New\u000a      material development requires fundamental research so that their\u000a      mechanical performance is fully evaluated under simulated service\u000a      conditions. The MBM lab at Portsmouth is one of the RR-approved centres\u000a      for new material research and validation work, due to our unique\u000a      specialist testing facilities developed in-house, which allow\u000a      well-controlled testing conditions and much-reduced test durations and\u000a      increased data generation per test piece, which otherwise not possible\u000a      with conventional methods. For research on fine grain RR1000 and U720Li,\u000a      work at Portsmouth has provided the first set of systematic\u000a      results on the effects of load ratio and loading waveform on crack growth\u000a      rates [1] and, identified, for the first time, the failure\u000a      mechanisms in time-independent\/dependent regimes [1, 2]. These, together\u000a      with the concerted efforts of alloy development (Cambridge University) and\u000a      microstructure characterisation (University of Southampton), have given\u000a      confidence to RR in adopting the new materials in their disc\u000a        production. For coarse grain RR1000 investigated in the DISPLACE\u000a      programme, we extended our detailed constitutive model [3] to cover the entire\u000a        range of operational and limit temperatures and developed a fatigue-creep-oxidation\u000a        model [6; Karabela1] which enabled the\u000a      prediction of crack growth rate considering the coupling effects of all\u000a      three factors for the first time. Together with the University of\u000a      Birmingham on the optimisation of material variables to minimise crack\u000a      growth; Serco on testing under combined thermo-mechanical testing and\u000a      ZenCrack on developing commercial finite element software for life\u000a      prediction of crack growth under simulated flight cycles, we successfully\u000a      delivered the project, with a direct impact on the RR in-house lifing\u000a        and materials development programme towards the certification of the\u000a        material, which paved the way for its use in the latest RR engines.\u000a    RR has confirmed that the new material and lifing technology developed\u000a      will be used for Trent XWB-1000 engines; and also in new engine projects\u000a      and up-rated versions of the Trent 900 and 1000 for Airbus A380 and Boeing\u000a      787. It has also a retrofit capability into the current high by-pass\u000a      turbofan engine fleet, thus increasing the potential impact further. These\u000a      represent a &#163;1.2 billion per year market opportunity to the UK\u000a      aerospace industry. A 1% specific fuel consumption (sfc) saving in these\u000a      products equates to 350kg less fuel used per engine per trans-Atlantic\u000a      flight. This reduces the cost of ownership by approximately &#163;100,000\u000a        per engine per year. The indirect benefits of this include reduced\u000a        travel costs due to reduced fuel consumption; increased economic\u000a        competitiveness of UK airlines in the world market and expansion of\u000a      employment opportunities in associated UK industries. There are direct\u000a        economic benefits to end-users in reduced operating costs, which for\u000a      the above example are estimated to be &#163;200,000 per year. The use\u000a      of the technology will also provide a sustainability benefit\u000a      through the extended use of components.\u000a    It is anticipated that the temperature capability of the engines will be\u000a      improved by approximately 30&#186;C as a result of the new material solution\u000a      from DISPLACE. This equates to a reduction in sfc, which for the designs\u000a      considered is estimated at 0.3% improvement. For a large twin-engined\u000a      aircraft flying from London to New York, a 0.3% sfc saving equates to a\u000a      700 kg reduction in fuel consumption, which translates into a reduction\u000a        of ~ 2.25 tonnes of CO2 emissions per flight.\u000a      RR engines introduced in 2012 onwards offer improved emissions and engine\u000a      efficiency over current designs as a result of this new material solution,\u000a      thus a significant step towards the ACARE industry goals for 2050 of a 50%\u000a      reduction in CO2 emissions per passenger-kilometre.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at Portsmouth has significantly improved the understanding of\u000a      damage tolerance under creep-fatigue-oxidation conditions experienced in\u000a      aero-engine components.

A turbine disc is a fracture critical component where the\u000a      failure of the disc can lead to the loss of the aircraft. It is also one\u000a      of the key components that dictates the overall efficiency of an engine\u000a      cycle. The structural integrity of discs under operational loading\u000a      conditions, including fatigue, creep and oxidation, is of paramount\u000a      importance to safety as well as to engine efficiency. The Mechanical\u000a      Behaviour of Materials (MBM) group at UoP has been working on fatigue\u000a      crack growth behaviour in nickel-based superalloys for many years, in\u000a      collaboration with Rolls-Royce (RR) and the Ministry of Defence (now\u000a      QinetiQ and Dstl). Since 1996, the group (Tong, Lupton,\u000a      Byrne) has been engaged in collaborative research with RR and other\u000a      university partners on the development and validation of a new generation\u000a      of nickel-based superalloys via a powder metallurgy route, including\u000a      U720Li and RR1000 [1-4]. The role of the Portsmouth group has been\u000a      distinctive from those of the other university partners in that we have\u000a      specifically focused on: (i) Novel specialist testing using fracture\u000a      mechanics concepts that allows well-controlled testing conditions with\u000a      significantly reduced test durations, which otherwise would not be\u000a      possible using conventional testing methods; and (ii) constitutive\u000a      modelling of creep-fatigue and creep-fatigue-oxidation that enables more\u000a      accurate predictions of crack growth rates at elevated temperature. In\u000a      particular, we systematically examined the effects of loading waveform and\u000a      R ratio on crack growth of alloy U720Li [1]; fatigue-creep interaction\u000a      [2-4]; constitutive modelling under creep-fatigue [3] and proposed a new\u000a      crack growth criterion [5, Tong1]. Through these\u000a      we have developed an essential framework on which crack growth in\u000a      nickel-based superalloys may be characterised.\u000a    This long-standing successful collaborative work led to the invitation of\u000a      Portsmouth group to a joint bid to TSB, which was subsequently awarded and\u000a      launched in 2008 as DISPLACE. The Portsmouth work was mainly on the\u000a      understanding of the effects of in-service loading variables on crack\u000a      growth rate and predicting crack growth lives for complex engine cycles,\u000a      utilising both novel experimental testing and advanced numerical\u000a      modelling. Specifically, we further developed our capacities in\u000a      constitutive modelling to cover the extended operational temperature\u000a      range, and utilised the vacuum data from partners to validate our new\u000a      crack growth criterion [5; Tong1] for the very\u000a      first time.

The LiftFan is very highly\u000a      loaded and susceptible to high cycle fatigue (HCF) so inspection limits of\u000a      critical parts of the fan need to be set at appropriate levels. The blades\u000a      of the fan are susceptible to minor impact of FOD from small particle\u000a      ingress, as all aero gas turbine fans are. The Portsmouth research was\u000a      targeted at the fatigue integrity of the JSF LifFan. The outcomes of our\u000a      research have helped to establish the safe stress level in the\u000a        presence of a known FOD threat and the inspection limits at a larger\u000a        damage size and with greater confidence. As a result, the Blisk\u000a      provided technical improvement and weight reduction over previous designs,\u000a      as well as improved airworthiness with significant economic benefits\u000a        due to reduced inspections (the precise values are confidential to\u000a      MOD and RR). The new knowledge developed is generic and can also be\u000a      applied to civil aero engines (e.g. RR Trent and BR700 engines) and to\u000a      legacy RAF engines (e.g. in Typhoon and Tornado aircraft).\u000a    All blades are susceptible to some degree of FOD; hence an effective\u000a      damage management scheme is essential for safety and economy. A high\u000a      integrity repair process has been under development at RR using a\u000a      proprietary laser additive technique in order to contain the damage and\u000a      maintain the structural integrity of the blades. The process is applicable\u000a      to critical rotating parts, which are key components in the current\u000a      generation of defence and future civil aero engines, with significant\u000a      economic benefits. The results of our research have contributed to the\u000a      validation of the method and increased the confidence in its use towards a\u000a      lower life cycle cost for critical components such as the Blisk,\u000a      supporting its economic application.\u000a    FOD is estimated by the USAF to cost the international aero-engine\u000a      industry 4 billion US dollars annually, therefore the development of\u000a      improved fatigue resistance in the presence of FOD during design and\u000a      manufacture of components is economically very important. Advanced surface\u000a      treatments, such as laser shock peening (LSP), have been introduced to\u000a      provide improved fatigue strength and crack growth resistance. The\u000a      treatment produces significant compressive residual stresses along the\u000a      leading edge of aerofoils such as fan blades, so that the critical region\u000a      becomes considerably more damage tolerant. Typically, LSP can achieve full\u000a      through section compressive residual stress at the leading edge, therefore\u000a      improving FOD tolerance where FOD is most expected. A fundamental\u000a      understanding of the fatigue behaviour of FOD in the presence of LSP is\u000a      vital, if this treatment is to be utilised to its full potential in\u000a      enhancing the fatigue resistance of fracture critical components in the\u000a      event of FOD.\u000a    The research carried out at Portsmouth from 2008 has provided some unique\u000a      insights on the influence of residual stresses due to LSP and FOD on the\u000a      near-tip stress -strain fields and early crack growth behaviour developed\u000a      under combined LCF+HCF loading. This is the first time such\u000a      information has become available, also the very first time a\u000a      rational analysis has been developed for early crack growth from FOD in an\u000a      LSP treated surface under service loading conditions [Lupton4].\u000a      The Portsmouth results have given further confidence in the use of LSP\u000a      treatment in FOD-susceptible components. The data and crack models\u000a        developed at Portsmouth have been used by RR in determining both design\u000a        stress levels and tolerable FOD damage size for critical aero engine\u000a      aerofoil components such as fan and compressor blades. Due to the\u000a      beneficial effects of the residual stresses from LSP treatment, these\u000a      limits are now set at higher levels with greater confidence, thus\u000a      contributing to safer design and economic life management.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at Portsmouth has had a major impact on risk reduction, improved\u000a      service life and reduced inspection\/maintenance costs of safety critical\u000a      and expensive fan and compressor components in military and civil\u000a      aero-engines, as demonstrated particularly by the Liftfan Blisk\u000a      manufactured by Rolls-Royce.\u000a    The research outcomes have also impacted on the specification of design\u000a      stress levels by Rolls-Royce and MOD for aerofoils susceptible to FOD,\u000a      enabling damage size inspection limits to be established at higher and\u000a      more economic levels.

Rotating aerofoils experience\u000a      both high cycle fatigue (HCF, from vibrations) and low cycle fatigue (LCF,\u000a      from large variations of centrifugal and thermal stresses). The Portsmouth\u000a      team is known as one of the few in the world with expertise in fatigue\u000a      studies under combined HCF+LCF loading conditions.\u000a    It has been recognised in recent years that Foreign Object Damage (FOD)\u000a      from ingestion of small particles is of major concern for the integrity of\u000a      aero-engines. The combination of FOD and complex loading conditions\u000a      experienced during flight could be significant limiting factors for\u000a      component life [1]. The impact of FOD on fatigue under combined HCF+LCF\u000a      loading had not been studied until recently. Portsmouth was the first\u000a      group to study the impact of FOD on early fatigue crack growth under\u000a        combined HCF+LCF conditions, as opposed to studies elsewhere on\u000a      crack initiation due to FOD (Universities of Oxford, Swansea, Manchester,\u000a      Berkley\/Harvard and USAF).The Portsmouth work also included the effects of\u000a      FOD repair and the benefits of laser shock peening, again focusing on\u000a      their effects on fatigue crack growth. The research was led by\u000a      Professor Byrne (2002- 2005; Emeritus Professor from 2006) and by\u000a      Professor Tong (from 2006).\u000a    The effects of combined HCF+LCF loading on fatigue crack growth from FOD\u000a      were studied in FOD-indented specimens of Ti-6Al-4V alloy, for both\u000a      as-FODed and after stress relief, using simulated flight cycles together\u000a      with finite element modelling [1-3]. The compressive stresses below the\u000a      bottom of the FOD indent were found to have a significant retarding effect\u000a      on the fatigue crack growth (FCG). This led to markedly reduced FCG rates\u000a      in FODed samples during early fatigue crack growth compared with those\u000a      annealed after FOD.\u000a    A study of fatigue behaviour of weld-repaired FOD-damaged aerofoil\u000a      specimens was also carried out for RR [4]. The data obtained for the\u000a      repaired aerofoil specimens were compared with those from the base\u000a      material and data previously obtained under the EPSRC\/MOD project [1-3]\u000a      for LCF and combined HCF+LCF loading. The results showed that the repaired\u000a      FOD specimens had superior fatigue resistance to crack onset and crack\u000a      growth behaviour to those without repair, hence offering improved fatigue\u000a      lives\u000a    Laser shock peening (LSP) enhances fatigue resistance by generating\u000a      compressive residual stresses along the leading edge of fan blades, such\u000a      that the critical region becomes more damage tolerant to FOD. In our\u000a      second EPSRC\/MOD project, in collaboration with QinetiQ, RR and the\u000a      University of Manchester, we examined the effects of LSP on aerofoil\u000a      specimens with FOD under discrete and combined HCF+LCF loading conditions.\u000a      This comprehensive study [5, 6] has produced conclusive evidence on the\u000a      beneficial effects of LSP on early FCG. Furthermore, a rational treatment\u000a      of fatigue crack growth in a complex residual stress field has been\u000a      proposed [6, Lupton4], where both compressive residual\u000a      stresses due to LSP and FOD and their influence on crack flank closure\u000a      were considered for the first time.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"10813","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    THR is one of the most successful surgical procedures, although the\u000d\u000a      long-term survival\u000d\u000a      rate of cemented acetabular cup implants is a main life-limiting factor\u000d\u000a      leading to costly\u000d\u000a      revisions.

Brunel managed the project,\u000a      generated engineering simulation models and conducted experimental\u000a      validations. The Brunel team comprised of Dr Mark Atherton (PI), Reader in\u000a      Mechanical Engineering; Dr Matthew Oldfield, Research Fellow (2005-2007);\u000a      and Dr Yijun Shen, Research Fellow (2004-2005).

This project focused on Distributed Mode Actuators\u000a      (DMA) that have begun to be used in televisions, tablet PCs and mobile\u000a      phones for producing sound and haptic function. These small piezoelectric\u000a      bimorph devices have several layers up to 100 microns thick and are highly\u000a      modal, operating at frequency ranges unsupported by conventional\u000a      excitation devices. This prevents the application of conventional modal\u000a      analysis techniques. There is a scarcity of literature addressing modal\u000a      validation of finite element (FE) models of bimorph devices that are both\u000a      too small for well-established experimental techniques and too complex to\u000a      be validated against 2D structural assumptions.\u000a    There are many complicating factors for an analytical prediction of the\u000a      modes of a piezoelectric plate actuator (DMA): The plate is multilayered,\u000a      coupling exists between the PZT material, applied voltage and mechanical\u000a      behaviour and the influence of non-ideal boundary conditions is\u000a      undetermined. The bimorph's scale makes it susceptible to production\u000a      inaccuracies that would be within acceptable tolerances in a macro-scale\u000a      device. Identifying and characterising these inaccuracies is critical to\u000a      achieving validation, and illustrates the limitations of relying on FE or\u000a      experimental results alone. 1D blocked force and 2D beam assumptions prove\u000a      insufficient for validation due to modes both in the length and width of\u000a      the device in operation.\u000a    Brunel developed a general method for validating simulation models of a\u000a      device that is too small for conventional modal analysis excitation. This\u000a      method is based on a simple and reliable measurement of the blocked force\u000a      produced by the device rather than on measurements of surface velocity of\u000a      the bimorph using a scanning vibrometer. The geometry of the device\u000a      coupled with the self-actuation method requires the validation to be\u000a      carried out in 3D. Only then is the model considered validated and\u000a      suitable for subsequent FE experimentation on minor modifications to\u000a      material and geometric properties. The lessons learned are universally\u000a      applicable to the modelling of piezoelectric bimorph devices.\u000a    A finite-element-based formulation for sensitivity analysis studies of\u000a      piezoelectric devices was also developed and an existing finite element\u000a      piezoelectric solver was extended to implement its solution. The solver\u000a      was applied to simulate the static operational and sensitivity\u000a      characteristics of a piezoelectric-based distributed mode actuator. The\u000a      finite element sensitivity solutions were verified against empirical\u000a      results obtained using the original system model. The sensitivity analysis\u000a      was performed with respect to the material piezoelectric coupling\u000a      parameters since it is these parameters that are subject to variability\u000a      under operational conditions. As such, these sensitivity results are of\u000a      interest from a robust design perspective.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12088","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The project developed a novel Powder Impression Moulding (PIM) process\u000a      which can manufacture lightweight sandwich structures from 100% mixed\u000a      post-consumer polymer.

The project aimed to develop\u000a      pallets, packaging and simple furniture using mixed post-consumer plastics\u000a      through the PIM process, which would be commercially competitive and\u000a      technically robust.\u000a    Prof Song investigated variants of the PIM process using different\u000a      mixtures of plastic waste. He identified a novel approach that could\u000a      produce sustainable PIM sandwich panels from plastics with up to 100%\u000a      mixed post-consumer plastic waste.\u000a    The team established that the novel PIM process was (i) exceptionally\u000a      tolerant to contaminations within the recyclate feedstock (sand, soil,\u000a      paper, metal and other non-polymer debris) [1] minimising the need for\u000a      cleaning pre-treatment of the waste plastic; (ii) that the process\u000a      tolerates high concentration of dissimilar polymers in the feedstock,\u000a      reducing the cost of polymer segregation and purification [2] and (iii)\u000a      feedstock from MRF in medium sized flake forms can be directly used in PIM\u000a      panels, saving excessive powder pulverisation as in the conventional PIM\u000a      process [2].\u000a    These findings demonstrate that the process can operate with minimum\u000a      sorting, purifying and cleaning and resizing of mixed waste plastic\u000a      recyclates as long as waste streams from different sources are monitored\u000a      so that the dominating polymer concentration is sufficient for appropriate\u000a      melting, encapsulation of high melting point foreign particles and\u000a      foaming. Hence the novel process is both energetically and economically\u000a      cheaper than the conventional process.\u000a    Thus, by demonstrating that mixed post-consumer plastics could be used in\u000a      the PIM process, the project established the PIM process as a recycling\u000a      method for the first time.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13048","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Cranfield's research has supported the leading position of Oxford\u000a      Instruments in magnet technology, with average magnet sales over &#163;10\u000a      million a year over the last five years, and with a marked upward trend.\u000a      These sales are enabled by the worldwide promotion and dissemination of\u000a      Oxford Instruments' magnet performance using measurements conducted using\u000a      the fibre optic technology developed by Cranfield [C2].

The first established that FBGs were capable\u000a      of monitoring transient events of microsecond duration [P1]. The second\u000a      showed that the FBG technology successfully operated at cryogenic\u000a      temperatures where they exhibited zero temperature response below ~100K\u000a      and could measure strain at temperatures down to 2.2K [P2]. Conventional\u000a      strain monitoring techniques cannot match these specifications,\u000a      particularly in the presence of large and varying magnetic fields. The\u000a      third area of research was the development of instrumentation [P3] to\u000a      facilitate the measurement of loads using FBGs embedded within fibre\u000a      reinforced composites [P4]. This led to the measurement of dynamic strain\u000a      effects within a superconducting magnet coil during a quench, i.e.,\u000a      becomes resistive following a small release of energy within the coil\u000a      [P5].\u000a    The ability of optical fibre sensor technology to monitor transient\u000a      events, with rise times of &lt;10 &#181;s, was first demonstrated under a\u000a      programme commissioned by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency\u000a      (DERA) [P1]. In this work FBGs &#8212; fabricated at Cranfield using a novel\u000a      combination of UV laser and interferometer to achieve precise control over\u000a      the reflected (Bragg) wavelength of the sensor [P6] - were used by\u000a      Cranfield and DERA to measure transient strains induced by a 100mm\u000a      diameter shell as it travelled along a gun barrel with an exit velocity of\u000a      ~1km\/s [P1]. The sensors were interrogated using instrumentation that was\u000a      purpose designed and built by the Cranfield team.\u000a    Cranfield has significant expertise in monitoring thermosetting resins as\u000a      they cure. Limitations to the use of dielectric sensors in carbon fibre\u000a      reinforced composites, led us to explore the use of optical fibre sensors\u000a      to monitor the curing of resins. This lead to the first demonstrations of\u000a      the measurement of internal strain developed both along and transverse\u000a      [P5] to the axes of FBGs embedded in curing composite components.\u000a    The dissemination of this work led to a research programme funded by\u000a      Oxford Instruments. The company had a requirement for dynamic strain\u000a      measurement in superconducting magnets. Cranfield undertook a\u000a      collaborative research programme with Oxford Instruments and, for the\u000a      first time, demonstrated that FBGs could measure strain in cryogenic\u000a      environments [P2].\u000a    Further collaborative investigations &#8212; supported by grants G1, G2, G3 &#8212;\u000a      used FBG sensors embedded into the composite structure of the\u000a      superconducting magnet coil, to monitor dynamic loading when a\u000a      superconducting magnet \"quenches\", i.e. becomes resistive following a\u000a      small release of energy within the coil, due, for example, to cracking of\u000a      the resin matrix [P5]. Coil designers need to understand the loads\u000a      imparted during a quench and the influence of those loads on the lifetime\u000a      of the coil. The rapidly changing magnetic field experienced during a\u000a      quench precludes the use of conventional electrical strain gauges. The\u000a      dielectric nature of the FBG yields measurements and insights that were\u000a      previously unavailable.\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a           Key\u000a              Researchers\u000a\u000a           Post details and\u000a              dates\u000a\u000a           Research\u000a\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr E Chehura\u000a          Research Fellow (2003 &#8211; present)\u000a          Fibre Optic Sensors\u000a            and instrumentation\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr S W James\u000a          Research Fellow (1993 - 1997); Lecturer (1997 &#8211; 2002); Senior Lecturer (2002 - 2007); Reader 2007 &#8211; present)\u000a          Fibre Optic Sensors\u000a            and instrumentation\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Prof I K\u000a            Partridge\u000a          Reader (1998 - 2004); Professor (2004 - present),\u000a            from 1\/10\/12 Professor at the Advanced Composites\u000a            Centre, Faculty of Engineering, Bristol University\u000a          Polymer composites,\u000a            cure monitoring\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Prof R P Tatam\u000a          Senior Lecturer (1992-1995); Reader (1995-1998);\u000a            Professor (1998 &#8211; present)\u000a          Fibre Optic Sensors\u000a            and instrumentation\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13049","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aZhao's development of the mild air hybrid engine technology has been exploited by China's largest\u000d\u000abus engine manufacturer, Yuchai.

This technology utilises a new\u000d\u000aproprietary intake system design and cam profile switching (CPS) devices and allows the engine to\u000d\u000aswitch between the air hybrid operation and normal engine operation [4].\u000d\u000aIn 2011, Prof Zhao's research successfully demonstrated that engine braking devices on\u000d\u000acommercial vehicles could be adapted for the air hybrid engine by relocating the devices from the\u000d\u000aexhaust valve to the intake valve. Compared to CPS devices, the production of the engine braking\u000d\u000adevice is simpler and can be retro-fitted to the engine. This has led to a significantly simplified mild\u000d\u000aair hybrid engine concept, Regenerative Engine Braking Device (RegenEBD). Subsequently, Prof\u000d\u000aZhao further developed RegenEBD in a second EPSRC sponsored project (2011-2014). The\u000d\u000aproject is led by Prof Zhao and Yuchai, the largest diesel engine manufacturer in China, provides\u000d\u000atechnical support including the supply of an engine and control system for the project, while Prof.\u000d\u000aR. Stobart at Loughborough University assists with technical information for control and drive cycle\u000d\u000asimulations. Prof Zhao developed the design concepts while the engineers at Yuchai implemented\u000d\u000athe concept through engineering, design, testing and optimisation so that the system and\u000d\u000acomponents can be produced for real engine applications with strong reliability and durability.\u000d\u000aThe research has successfully demonstrated that RegenEBD technology is capable of\u000d\u000aregenerative stop-start operations, supplying service air, or providing instant boost depending on\u000d\u000athe vehicle type and usages. A major advantage of RegenEBD is its flexible applicability: it can be\u000d\u000aretrofitted to the existing engine and transmission system without affecting the engine's normal\u000d\u000aoperation or it can be fitted as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) option for the new\u000d\u000avehicle. Furthermore, the most recently formulated air connector design is expected to enable a\u000d\u000acommon component to be used to realise the RegenEBD technology for different engines and\u000d\u000avehicles. In 2011, Yuchai fitted the RegenEBD engine to working city buses in Yulin city where\u000d\u000aYuchai is based.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"13791","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The beauty of the printed electronics technology that arose from the\u000a      FAB-3D is that it is capable of being used across a wide range of\u000a      application areas.

His research expertise is in\u000a      inorganic nano-materials; phosphors and display materials; nano-particles;\u000a      and printed electronics. His Phosphor and Display Materials Group is one\u000a      of very few academic teams that have been carrying out systematic research\u000a      on phosphors both as powders and thin films in recent times. The\u000a      underpinning research has its origins back in 2006 when Prof Silver was\u000a      finishing an EPSRC\/DTI\/Link grant on ACEL displays. Having taken a fresh\u000a      look at ACEL displays, he threw out the old rules for making them and made\u000a      a breakthrough in the research and design of flexible ACEL displays.1\u000a      The new idea was to put the ACEL phosphor powder in a single binder layer\u000a      that was extremely flexible and also acted as a dielectric layer. This\u000a      removed the need for additional binder layers, making the displays much\u000a      thinner so they could be used in a variety of new formats, allowing the\u000a      building of very simple, cheap displays.2-4 This led to a\u000a      patent, as well as to new lines of research to understand the mechanism\u000a      behind the ACEL phenomena. The initial publications attracted interest\u000a      from several UK industries. This spurred on further research to understand\u000a      the ACEL phenomena and the potential routes which led to further possible\u000a      applications. During this time a UK company (Elumin8 Ltd.) contacted Prof\u000a      Silver wanting to make more flexible and brighter ACEL displays. This led\u000a      to TSB funding for the PLACES program and then (with further companies)\u000a      the SHAPEL program. Fundamental research on the binder formulation, in\u000a      particular on the effects of incorporating dielectric into the binder\u000a      layer, so that the structure was a mono-layer, and then introducing a\u000a      highly reflective background, showed how the brightness could be improved\u000a      by over 50%.5,6 Having made these breakthroughs in the\u000a      underlying science, Silver realised that much of what had been done was\u000a      applicable to 3-dimensional printing, and that with the latter it would be\u000a      possible to research and then develop and envisage new materials to\u000a      underpin new kinds of ACEL displays and printed electronic circuits. This\u000a      led Prof. Silver to contact a number of companies to apply for a TSB\u000a      project.\u000a    In the Technology Strategy Board-funded project `Fabrication of Complex\u000a      3D Structures Using Direct Writing and Laser Annealing' (2008-11), Prof\u000a      Silver brought together industrial partners such as Johnson Matthey (JM),\u000a      Keeling &amp; Walker Ltd (K&amp;W), Oxley Development Company Ltd (Oxley),\u000a      Intrinsiq Materials Ltd (IML), Printed Electronics Ltd (PEL) (industrial\u000a      lead), and Nottingham Trent University. The project aimed to apply\u000a      functional materials (often in nano-form) to various substrates (both flat\u000a      and 3D), using printing methods (such as ink-jet, or screen printing) in\u000a      order to fabricate electronic\/optoelectronic circuits. One of the primary\u000a      aims of the work was to examine the possibilities of ink-jet printing both\u000a      hard and soft metal nano-particles.\u000a    Prof Silver and his team carried out the research and development of the\u000a      functional inks that form the individual layers of multilayer devices such\u000a      as AC electroluminescent lamps. They developed all the functional inks\u000a      used in the programme, and had input into the design of the architecture\u000a      of the devices. They also characterised the structures produced using a\u000a      range of techniques including scanning and transmission electron\u000a      microscopy (SEM\/TEM), surface analysis using x-ray photoelectron\u000a      spectroscopy and x-ray powder diffraction. They successfully pioneered the\u000a      screen printing of AC electroluminescent films onto ink-jet printed\u000a      circuits, demonstrated them and then passed on the knowhow to Printed\u000a      Electronics Ltd.7 In addition, working demonstrators were\u000a      produced which were acknowledged to give excellent performance.7,8\u000a    PEL were an excellent industrial lead and their expertise\/knowhow in\u000a      ink-jet printing was also fundamental for the successful outcome of the\u000a      project. JM and IML both supplied, researched and developed metallic inks\u000a      with PEL and Brunel. K&amp;W supplied inorganic conducting nano-particles,\u000a      Oxley needed new fabrication methods for producing high-end capacitances.\u000a      Nottingham Trent University were involved in laser annealing the\u000a      nano-particles.\u000a    The novel technology produced offers economic and sustainable advantages\u000a      to existing technologies such as sputtering and aerosol spray pyrolysis.\u000a      In particular the project demonstrated that metal particle inks can be\u000a      printed in any desired configuration on various substrates such as ITO\u000a      films and paper using ink-jet printers. The process is simple: ink-jet\u000a      printers are used to print metal particle inks, and once the ink liquid\u000a      vaporises, only metal particles are left; once exposed to high-intensity\u000a      laser light, they sinter (the edges between them will join up). This\u000a      process allows very fine detailed circuitry to be printed. The sintering\u000a      process is low temperature and cheap. Screen printing processes were\u000a      developed for laying electroluminescent layers on the printed electrodes\u000a      to fabricate low-cost displays that could be operated with small batteries\u000a      (so low maintenance). Once electricity is provided to the display circuits\u000a      by the battery, they will light up on the paper. The printed circuits and\u000a      electrodes can be copper but gold and silver also work well.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14041","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact on production: decisions by regulatory authorities have been\u000a        influenced\u000a      In December 2008, the GB Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) approved the\u000a      BioBullets product\u000a      Silver Bullets 1000 for use in public water supplies (ref 7).

For\u000a      example, Thames Water spent &#163;1m in 2010 clearing zebra mussels from their\u000a      raw water pipes (ref\u000a      12). Anglian Water reported in 2011 that the increased pressure required\u000a      to pump water through\u000a      zebra mussel-infested pipes cost &#163;500K per annum in additional energy\u000a      costs (ref 12). Following\u000a      trials of BioBullets, the companies stated:\u000a    \u000a      \"We believe BioBullets will save hundreds of thousands of pounds in\u000a          operational costs in a\u000a          way that has no adverse impact on the environment.\" (ref 12).\u000a      \u000aWe are very hopeful BioBullets are the solution we've been looking\u000a          for having trialed them\u000a          at our treatment works at Alton in Suffolk and Pitsford in\u000a          Northamptonshire. In both cases\u000a          we saw a significant reduction in the numbers of mussels without any\u000a          impact on the\u000a          treatment process or the environment.\" (ref 12).\u000a    \u000a    BioBullets is currently negotiating commercial terms with a service\u000a      provider [text removed for\u000a      publication] to deliver the product across the UK water industry.\u000a    Impact on commerce: the performance of an existing business has been\u000a        improved\u000a      In June 2011, a dedicated manufacturing plant for BioBullets was opened in\u000a      Bristol [text removed\u000a      for publication].

In 2008 a grant to\u000a      BioBullets from the US National\u000a      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (ref 14) enabled the\u000a      development and testing of\u000a      a formulation to control invasive seasquirts (Didemnum vexillum),\u000a      pests which threaten the global\u000a      marine aquaculture industry.

Also,\u000a      zebra mussels can sense chlorine and other toxins in the environment and\u000a      respond by closing their\u000a      valves: effective treatment therefore requires prolonged dosing, which\u000a      produces trihalomethanes\u000a      by reaction with organic material. Trihalomethanes are toxic to humans and\u000a      other animals, so there\u000a      has been continued tightening of regulatory controls on the discharge of\u000a      chlorine (e.g. the\u000a      European Water Framework Directive 2000\/60\/EC).\u000a    Moggridge, in collaboration with Aldridge, theorised that toxins could be\u000a      delivered to zebra\u000a      mussels sequestered in an edible coating, overcoming the valve closure\u000a      response - a `Trojan\u000a      horse' approach to active ingredient delivery. Broad patent protection has\u000a      been granted (ref 3).\u000a    Dr Moggridge's contribution focussed on the chemical composition,\u000a      formulation and\u000a      manufacture of the BioBullet particles. A key formulation decision was\u000a      which toxin would form the\u000a      core of the `BioBullet'. KCl was initially chosen, after demonstrating\u000a      that it is particularly toxic to\u000a      freshwater bivalves [text removed for publication], but at low doses is\u000a      inert to most other\u000a      organisms (ref 2). The mussels' natural filtering behaviour internally\u000a      concentrates the toxin when it\u000a      is delivered in appropriate particulate form, reducing the quantity of\u000a      active ingredient required, and\u000a      meaning that it is effective as a one-off treatment, rather than needing\u000a      continuous dosing.\u000a      Furthermore, the `BioBullet' is engineered to dissolve completely within a\u000a      few hours, thus\u000a      eliminating the risk of polluting the wider ecosystem. The effectiveness\u000a      of the BioBullet product\u000a      was improved in 2008 and 2009 by the use of a more potent, yet still\u000a      environmentally benign active\u000a      ingredient. Particle optimization has focused on the appropriate balance\u000a      between a smaller\u000a      capsule, that will be more easily recognised as food by the mussels, and a\u000a      larger capsule, that will\u000a      have a better release time (ref 4).\u000a    Working on further aspects of the control strategy, Dr Moggridge's team\u000a      demonstrated in 2008\u000a      that zebra mussels show seasonal peaks of increased susceptibility to\u000a      toxins (ref 5), which has\u000a      implications for the overall design of chemical control strategies, and\u000a      for the amount of toxin\u000a      required to achieve the desired effect. The team's subsequent studies to\u000a      understand the filter-\u000a      feeding behaviour of zebra mussels have identified methodologies for\u000a      indirectly quantifying fouling\u000a      levels in inaccessible pipelines, and demonstrating the potential of\u000a      mussels as bioremediation tools\u000a      within nutrient-enriched reservoirs (ref 6). Additional studies\u000a      demonstrated that multiple active\u000a      agents, with differing physiological impacts on zebra mussels, can have\u000a      synergistic effects, thereby\u000a      reducing the amount of product needed to control the target species.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14042","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Psynova Neurotech was founded in 2005 by Professors Sabine Bahn and Chris\u000a      Lowe to commercialise the diagnostic products developed through Professor\u000a      Bahn's research.\u000a    In June 2008, Psynova Neurotech announced a partnership with CLIA\u000a      approved Rules-Based Medicine, Inc.

It can take several months or even years\u000a      until a diagnosis has been established.\u000a    Biomarkers have multiple applications, which include the identification\u000a      of high-risk individuals and disease subgroups that could serve as target\u000a      populations for intervention trials; facilitation of \"objective\"\u000a      diagnosis; monitoring of patient response to drug treatments; and\u000a      assessment of patient compliance.\u000a    Professor Sabine Bahn joined the University as an NHS Research Fellow in\u000a      1997. From 2001 she was a Clinical Lecturer in Psychiatry before joining\u000a      Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology in 2004. She was promoted to\u000a      Professor in 2013. Her research team within the Cambridge Centre for\u000a      Neuropsychiatric Research (CCNR) has developed molecular diagnostics for\u000a      major neuropsychiatric disorders and determined the cellular mechanisms\u000a      that regulate the expression of biomarker molecules altered in specific\u000a      psychiatric disease states so as to develop novel therapeutic approaches.\u000a      The team's work relates to the novel application of multiplex ELISA and\u000a      mass spectrometry applications for psychiatric disorders.\u000a    CCNR uses advanced molecular profiling techniques (microarrays,\u000a      proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics) to globally investigate\u000a      abnormalities in gene\/protein\/metabolite\/lipid \"expression\" in postmortem\u000a      human brain tissue and in blood and other samples derived from\u000a      schizophrenia patients and matched controls, to establish evidence-based\u000a      hypotheses. For example, the team's examination of postmortem brain tissue\u000a      of patients with schizophrenia provided evidence of abnormal brain glucose\u000a      utilization [Ref 3]. Since 2002, Bahn and her team have investigated\u000a      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from living patients. The team studied\u000a      CSF samples from drug-naive or minimally treated patients with first-onset\u000a      paranoid schizophrenia and demographically matched healthy controls.\u000a    The CSF findings also suggest alterations in glucoregulatory processes in\u000a      CSF of drug-naive patients with first-onset schizophrenia. The results\u000a      also imply that the initiation of antipsychotic treatment during a first\u000a      psychotic episode may influence treatment response and\/or outcome [Ref 6].\u000a    In 2007-08 the team moved to using its molecular profiling techniques on\u000a      blood serum. During the developmental stage of Aid for the Diagnosis of\u000a      Schizophrenia (VeriPsych), 200 biomarker candidates were investigated to\u000a      assess their connection to schizophrenia.

Prof Tarverdi, Director of\u000a      Extrusion Technology at Brunel University, was approached by Elster in\u000a      2003 to help identify the factors influencing the wear and fatigue in the\u000a      moving parts in water meters, and develop new materials to improve\u000a      installation life-time and reduce maintenance costs. Given his expertise\u000a      in polymer processing, mechanical, thermodynamical, microscopic and\u000a      elemental analysis, and in using extrusion and injection moulding\u000a      technologies, Prof Tarverdi was asked by Elster to provide detailed\u000a      information and advice about the composition of the compounds used in\u000a      their water meters. This initial relationship with Elster has developed\u000a      into a long-term collaborative partnership, and Prof Tarverdi's research\u000a      has been continuously used since 2003 to enhance the properties of the\u000a      materials for manufacturing and moulding Elster's water meters. During\u000a      this time over 20 projects were commissioned and completed by the Brunel\u000a      research team. See for instance [1].\u000a    In 2005, Elster wanted to replace some of the metal and glass components\u000a      in their meters. To identify replacements for the glass, Prof Tarverdi\u000a      examined the effects of using polycarbonate with `nano-clay' [2]. This was\u000a      found to prevent moisture ingression, thereby maximising the transparency\u000a      of the polycarbonate moulding. This research successfully demonstrated the\u000a      potential of the method [3,4].\u000a    In 2008\/09, Prof Tarverdi further enhanced the compounds used in the\u000a      manufacture of the water meters by identifying how potential long term\u000a      corrosion in the bodies of the water meter could be prevented. His\u000a      research involved exposing a range of polymers to the chemicals in the\u000a      water and the intensive rays of the sun (ultra-violet oxidation) to\u000a      determine their susceptibility. He identified a specific set of acetal\u000a      polymers which demonstrated minimal chemical degradation. In addition, he\u000a      provided guidelines for connecting the meters into the water network in\u000a      the presence of copper and bronze pipes.\u000a    This research demonstrated that some chemicals, which are supposed to\u000a      enhance the properties of polymers [5], were not performing to the\u000a      required standard to prevent polymer deterioration and degradation. The\u000a      compounds used to manufacture the Elster meters did not seem to have had\u000a      the optimum masterbatch (concentrated compounds) to prevent UV oxidation\u000a      and degradation of the meters.\u000a    This finding has led the Brunel University to successfully apply for the\u000a      TSB call `Boosting Innovation in Manufacturing Competencies'. The project,\u000a      `Ultrasonically Assisted Compounding for Masterbatch Production' [6], with\u000a      industrial partners Colloids Ltd., Telsonic, Omya, Johnson Matthey and\u000a      Elster, aims to enhance existing materbatch productions by using\u000a      nano-fillers such as nano-carbon black, pigments and antioxidants through\u000a      ultrasonication to achieve maximum dispersion of nano fillers. The new\u000a      materbatch, once verified for its effectiveness, will be supplied to\u000a      companies like Elster to manufacture their components and assess its\u000a      effectiveness.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14102","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Aided by investment from Cambridge Enterprise, Enval Ltd was founded in\u000d\u000a      2006 by Professor Chase along with Dr. Carlos Ludlow-Palafox and Dr. Alex\u000d\u000a      Domin (another Cambridge PhD Student from the Department) to commercialise\u000d\u000a      the group's research into microwave pyrolysis. In 2010, the company\u000d\u000a      received a grant from the East of England Development Agency for\u000d\u000a      `Development of a Recycling Process for Laminated Packaging' to develop\u000d\u000a      the capabilities needed to optimize the use and maximize the value of the\u000d\u000a      products generated during the Enval process (ref 7). Further investment in\u000d\u000a      the company has been secured from a syndicate of investors including\u000d\u000a      Cambridge Enterprise and business angels from both Cambridge Capital Group\u000d\u000a      and Cambridge Angels. The company has raised a total of &#163;2.2 M from a\u000d\u000a      variety of sources during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 July 2013. The\u000d\u000a      company now employs 7 people and has premises on 3 sites (ref 6).\u000d\u000a    Enval's patented technology offers a genuine novel commercial recycling\u000d\u000a      route for plastic\/aluminium laminate packaging that has, to date, been\u000d\u000a      unrecyclable. The process is very attractive to waste handlers as it\u000d\u000a      removes the need to send waste laminates to land-fill and enables\u000d\u000a      increasingly-used aluminium laminate packaging to be described as\u000d\u000a      \"recyclable\" and these are both important objectives for the packaging\u000d\u000a      industry and its customers. The clean aluminium produced by the process is\u000d\u000a      ready for introduction into the secondary aluminium supply chain. Recycled\u000d\u000a      aluminium is valued as being environmentally friendly as it takes\u000d\u000a      approximately 95% less energy to produce secondary aluminium via recycling\u000d\u000a      operations than is otherwise consumed when producing primary aluminium\u000d\u000a      from bauxite. The Enval process is a net producer of electrical energy as\u000d\u000a      the electricity generated on site from the hydrocarbon components of the\u000d\u000a      waste packing is more than sufficient to generate the microwaves needed to\u000d\u000a      drive the process.\u000d\u000a    In 2008, Enval commenced construction of a one-third commercial scale\u000d\u000a      pilot-plant at its R&amp;D centre in Luton and this unit has been operated\u000d\u000a      since 2011 to demonstrate the benefits of the process to potential\u000d\u000a      customers, treating a variety of materials to demonstrate the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of the patented technology. Despite generating considerable\u000d\u000a      interest it became clear that given the conservative nature of the waste\u000d\u000a      handling sector, a full commercial scale demonstration unit would be\u000d\u000a      required before orders could be secured.\u000d\u000a    In 2011 Enval turned to the opposite side of the supply chain of\u000d\u000a      laminated packaging and partnered with both Nestl&#233; and Kraft Foods (now\u000d\u000a      known as Mondelez International outside of the USA) to create a commercial\u000d\u000a      consortium to support the construction of the first commercial scale plant\u000d\u000a      for Enval's patented material recovery technology (ref 10,11). The first\u000d\u000a      commercial-scale unit has been constructed at Alconbury Weald Enterprise\u000d\u000a      Zone, Huntingdon. Commissioning commenced in April 2013, and the unit\u000d\u000a      pyrolyses laminate waste to produce elemental aluminium and hydrocarbon\u000d\u000a      fuels.

In Europe there is potential to recover more\u000d\u000a      than 40,000 tonnes of aluminium per year from drinks cartons alone, but\u000d\u000a      new processes are needed to treat these wastes.\u000d\u000a    Microwave induced pyrolysis involves the pyrolysis of the waste in a\u000d\u000a      stirred bed of particulate carbon that is heated by microwave radiation,\u000d\u000a      an approach that overcomes the major difficulties that arise from\u000d\u000a      alternative methods. As opposed to incineration, pyrolysis takes place\u000d\u000a      without the combustion of the material, avoiding the production of\u000d\u000a      green-house gases or toxic emissions. Treatment of aluminium-containing\u000d\u000a      laminates by this method recovers the content of aluminium foil as a very\u000d\u000a      high quality metallic aluminium and the organic content is cracked to\u000d\u000a      produce liquid and gas hydrocarbon fractions that can be used both in\u000d\u000a      feedstock recycling (as a hydrocarbon oil) and in energy generation to\u000d\u000a      more than compensate for the consumption of electricity during microwave\u000d\u000a      heating\u000d\u000a    The potential of recovery of aluminum and hydrocarbons from laminated\u000d\u000a      packaging wastes using microwave induced pyrolysis was first investigated\u000d\u000a      under a grant from EPSRC's WR3 scheme (1999-2002). Development of the\u000d\u000a      technology continued thereafter, which has subsequently led to the design\u000d\u000a      of commercial-scale continuous equipment and a successful worldwide patent\u000d\u000a      application. Professor Chase and Dr Ludlow-Palafox's research elucidated\u000d\u000a      the chemical engineering science that underlies this method of conducting\u000d\u000a      pyrolysis, and utilized that information in the development of the process\u000d\u000a      to the stage suitable for commercial exploitation. Prototype (small-scale)\u000d\u000a      equipment (reactor vessels, and product collection systems) suitable for\u000d\u000a      use in a continuous process was developed and various design exercises to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate the technological, economic and environmental advantages of\u000d\u000a      the process were carried out.

Hall joined the Institute as a Lecturer in\u000a      1985 before promotion\u000a      to Reader in 1999 and Professor in 2003. Her group looked at biosensor\u000a      construction from first\u000a      principles and proposed alternative formats and measurement regimes to\u000a      those currently adopted.\u000a      Some of the underpinning aspects of this research received EPSRC funding\u000a      and were undertaken\u000a      by two PDRAs and a Marshall Scholar in Hall's group; Dr. Ian Harding,\u000a      Research Associate from\u000a      1997 to 2001, now Technology officer at Agamatrix, Dr. Justin Gooding\u000a      Research Associate from\u000a      1994 to 1996, now Professor at University of New South Wales and Sridhar\u000a      Iyengar, Marshall\u000a      Scholar 1998-2002 now Chief Technology Officer at AgaMatrix.\u000a    The idea emerged through Professor Hall's research on signal\u000a      deconvolution using alternating\u000a      potential wave techniques in electrochemistry where she showed mechanistic\u000a      detail in enzyme\u000a      linked biosensors for the first time (ref 1). This was reinforced by\u000a      modelling of flow and diffusion\u000a      characteristics, enzyme immobilisation, etc. with the outcomes rejecting\u000a      many previous\u000a      assumptions from others that used an invalid theoretical approximation,\u000a      based on an incorrect\u000a      assumption of uniform concentration gradients. The work provided key\u000a      insight for development of\u000a      an improved glucose biosensor (ref 6).\u000a    Building on this, the concept proposed by Professor Hall was that better\u000a      signal processing and\u000a      deconvolution would overcome the limitations identified and deliver a\u000a      glucose measurement with\u000a      greater integrity in an electrochemical biosensor (ref 1-5).\u000a    At the time, common practice was to apply a fixed voltage stimulus to the\u000a      electrochemical sensor\u000a      and measure a steady-state current. This was a simple method to determine\u000a      the concentration of\u000a      glucose, but accuracy depended on many factors being constant and known a\u000a      priori (e.g. no\u000a      chemical interferences in the sample, known electrode area, etc.).\u000a      However, in real samples, many\u000a      quantities are not known, and in the case of blood samples, there may be\u000a      many interfering\u000a      substances such as Vitamin C or paracetamol.\u000a    The principle inspiration for this impact focused on time-varying\u000a      sinusoidal voltage waveforms to\u000a      stimulate the electrochemical glucose sensor and generate a reciprocal\u000a      sinusoidal response\u000a      current, thereby enabling the extraction of time constants related to the\u000a      electrochemical reactions\u000a      that were either specific to the glucose reaction or to an interfering\u000a      substance (such as Vitamin C).\u000a      The time-varying nature of this approach inherently generated a\u000a      measureable signal that contained\u000a      more rich information (as compared to a steady-state response as was the\u000a      common case at the\u000a      time), and thus subsequently allowed for the separation of the desired\u000a      glucose signal from the\u000a      interfering signal.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14125","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    By guiding professionals to proven sustainable technology &#8212; cool roofs &#8212;\u000a      Prof Kolokotroni's research contributed to establishing an organisation\u000a      which has been continuing to advocate for and lobby cool roof products\u000a      based on her research findings.\u000a    In 2009, the European Cool Roofs Council (http:\/\/www.coolroofcouncil.eu\/)\u000a      was launched at Brunel University, committing to advocating cool roof\u000a      products for their impacts on mitigating climate change, reducing the\u000a      Urban Heat Island effect and thereby contributing to creating a\u000a      sustainable urban landscape. Prof Kolokotroni's research on identifying\u000a      the Urban Heat Island effect in London and verifying the environmental\u000a      benefits of cool roof technologies has been essential to the establishment\u000a      of the Council. The European Cool Roofs Council, a not-for-profit European\u000a      association, is now proactively lobbying national and European legislative\u000a      organisations for the inclusion of cool roofs as a mitigating strategy for\u000a      cities; for example, in Greece, the national building regulations specify\u000a      the inclusion of cool paints for all new public buildings. In the UK, cool\u000a      roofs are considered for inclusion in BREEAM. The Council has also\u000a      standardised cool roof materials by developing a strict Product Rated\u000a      Programme which informs users &#8212; code bodies, architects, building owners\u000a      and specifiers &#8212; of radiative property values under the Programme. The\u000a      Council members include multi-national industry members such as Monier\u000a      Group (roof construction materials), Daikin (air-conditioning equipment)\u000a      and Dow (construction chemicals), government agencies, educational\u000a      institutions, energy service companies, etc. across Europe and it has\u000a      direct links to its US equivalent, the US Cool Roof Council (http:\/\/www.coolroofs.org).\u000a      Prof Kolokotroni is a board member of the technical committee and the\u000a      Rating Scheme Certification Committee.\u000a    In 2010, GLA first published the `Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for\u000a      London' which was updated in 2011. The strategy commits in Action 5.10\u000a      that `the Mayor will work with partners to assess and promote \"cool roof\u000a      technology\" in London to reduce demand for mechanical cooling' (p67). The\u000a      European Cool Roofs Council was specifically stated as the partner for\u000a      this action (p113).

The research on the\u000a      Urban Heat Island Effect was received with keen interest from policy\u000a      makers, raising their awareness: in 2008, GLA acknowledged the Urban Heat\u000a      Island Effect in The London Plan (4.31-4.32).\u000a    The London Plan (2008) was soon replaced by a newer version of the London\u000a      Plan in 2011, which more extensively and concretely lays out its\u000a      strategies to deal with the Urban Heat Island Effect: it states that it\u000a      aims to `address issues of environmental quality raised by the urban heat\u000a      island effect' as one of its `strategic priorities' (p50) and that `The\u000a      Mayor seeks to reduce the impact of the urban heat island effect in\u000a      London' (p144) and endeavours to avoid `internal overheating and\u000a      contributing to the urban heat island effect' in its future design and\u000a      construction plans (p136).\u000a    Prof Kolokotroni's research also had impacts on building practice,\u000a      through widening awareness amongst building professionals of the Urban\u000a      Heat Island Effect. Her research results from 1999 to 2000, which measured\u000a      Urban Heat Island intensities, were directly incorporated by the Chartered\u000a      Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) into their latest\u000a      publication of the CIBSE Guide A: Environmental Design (Section 2.10)\u000a      (2006). The Guide serves as the primary source of information for building\u000a      professionals to introduce the latest research and best practice in\u000a      environmentally sustainable design, and it is still current. Using this\u000a      information, designers can take the higher temperatures in the city into\u000a      account in their designs, thus reducing carbon emissions from their\u000a      building while maintaining comfortable conditions for people.\u000a    In addition to its industrial and political applications, in 2013, the\u000a      research helped Energy-BITS (http:\/\/www.energybits.eu),\u000a      in collaboration with media production companies, develop games,\u000a      competitions and documentaries in order to raise awareness of energy use\u000a      for youth (aged 14-18) The website can be viewed in 9 languages.\u000a      Similarly, in 2012, the research contributed to establishing the\u000a      Universities and Students for Energy Efficiency Association (http:\/\/www.useefficiency.eu)\u000a      which aims to improve energy efficiency in university buildings and\u000a      provide training programmes for students by bringing together universities\u000a      and companies across Europe.

This night-time\u000a      warming is mainly caused by high thermal mass materials used in buildings\u000a      and lack of vegetation. The high temperature in buildings in London can\u000a      cause discomfort for everyone, and increases health risks for the\u000a      vulnerable in particular. This leads to higher demands of energy for air\u000a      cooling which is a major contributing factor of global warming. Prof\u000a      Kolokotroni's database, which quantified the environmental impact of\u000a      buildings in London, was the only contemporaneous database and is still in\u000a      use today to build a forecast model for the likely air temperature in a\u000a      particular location in London. [Ref 4 in section 3]\u000a    In response to the research, the Greater London Authority (GLA) in 2003,\u000a      subsequently supported further research to evaluate the effect of the\u000a      Urban Heat Island Effect on buildings' energy demand and investigated\u000a      strategies to mitigate the effect on buildings and cities. The findings,\u000a      along with recommendations for policy makers to mitigate the Urban Heat\u000a      Island Effect, have been incorporated in a publicly available report,\u000a      `London's Urban Heat Island: A Summary for Decision Makers', published by\u000a      GLA in 2006. In the same year, her recommendations and research were\u000a      published in the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers\u000a      Guide A which is the prime source of expertise for sustainable development\u000a      for building engineers.\u000a    In 2007, Prof Kolokotroni was awarded an EPSRC funded project &#8212; the\u000a      Development of a Local Urban Climate Model and its Application to the\u000a      Intelligent Development of Cities (LUCID) &#8212; as a principal investigator\u000a      along with researchers from University College London and the University\u000a      of Reading. The database was further developed by Prof Kolokotroni and Dr\u000a      R Giridharan (then a research fellow) at Brunel University in 2007-2008 in\u000a      order to understand how the physical characteristics of London had caused\u000a      the high nocturnal temperature. The database was used to validate other\u000a      forecasting models (developed by LUCID partners, University of Reading,\u000a      Arup and ADMS-Cambridge) in 2009 and 2010. In 2012, the database and the\u000a      forecast model developed at Brunel populated the quantitative data to\u000a      examine the effect of future climate change on the energy demand of the\u000a      buildings in urban areas.\u000a    Prof Kolokotroni in 2009 began to apply the database and forecast model\u000a      to validate the effectiveness of the `cool roofs' technology &#8212; roofs made\u000a      of materials which effectively reflect the solar radiation and release the\u000a      absorbed heat thereby keeping the roofs cool &#8212; as a strategy to mitigate\u000a      the Urban Heat Island effect at a local level. The research proved that\u000a      cool roofs can improve the thermal comfort by an average of 2.502daC,\u000a      reducing the energy demand by 6-7%. As the only UK academic\u000a      representative, along with GLA as the policy maker, the EU funded project\u000a      `Cool Roof in the EU' led to the launch of the European Cool Roofs Council\u000a      (hosted at Brunel University), a not-for-profit organisation.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15504","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research work has made direct significant economic impact\/benefits in\u000d\u000a      several key technical areas, in particular in combined uses of inverse\u000d\u000a      Finite Element (FE) modelling and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE),\u000d\u000a      biomechanics led sports footwear design and development, and application\u000d\u000a      of hardfacing materials for green manufacturing over the assessment\u000d\u000a      period.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The inverse FE modelling programs with research output 1 and other\u000d\u000a        developments have been successfully used to test the constitutive\u000d\u000a        parameters of different materials groups\/systems where standard samples\u000d\u000a        are not readily available. The framework has made it possible to\u000d\u000a        integrate material testing with CAE in situations where rapid and\u000d\u000a        realistic material property identification is crucial. Through several\u000d\u000a        major enterprise projects [research projects 1-5], the developed inverse\u000d\u000a        FE framework has been applied in different application environments over\u000d\u000a        the assessment period. Typical cases include: continuous indentation\u000d\u000a        tests of sports materials (foams and layered structures) for sports shoe\u000d\u000a        design; in situ study of welded structures for car bodies and\u000d\u000a        micro spot-welded joints of micro thermocouples; and indentation bending\u000d\u000a        studies of latex rubbers\/nano-composites for curing control and\u000d\u000a        biological tissues (bladder tissues) for simulating human prostate\u000d\u000a        movement and bladder filling. These applications have spread across\u000d\u000a        several industrial sectors including sports engineering (basketball\u000d\u000a        shoes), medical engineering (prostate cancer treatment) and energy\u000d\u000a        sectors (heat exchanger gaskets). For example, the research has led to\u000d\u000a        the evaluation of the feasibility of using indentation tests on extruded\u000d\u000a        packaging materials (plastic properties of extruded cans and plastic\u000d\u000a        bottles) for the Unilever (Port Sunlight Site) CAE team [source 5.1].\u000d\u000a        The efficiency of the top load simulation of three new packaging designs\u000d\u000a        has been significantly improved; the estimated reduction of simulation\u000d\u000a        time through confined property domain of Design of Experiment is over\u000d\u000a        20% [source 5.1].

Over the assessment period, these two outputs and\u000d\u000a        other associated publications have directly led to the development of\u000d\u000a        sports footwear based on different functional regions of the foot with\u000d\u000a        specific soft tissue properties and bone structures. As a result, an\u000d\u000a        industrial patent has been granted to the industrial user (ANTA,\u000d\u000a        CN102488352A, 27\/12\/2011-26\/12\/2031) to protect the intellectual\u000d\u000a        property of their new products.

The work has found applications in a range of\u000d\u000a      industrial sectors, in particular the Far East where new green\u000d\u000a      technologies are urgently needed to be incorporated into the regional fast\u000d\u000a      industrial developments.\u000d\u000a    All of this research was either conducted at MEMARC and led and\u000d\u000a      principally performed by X.

The modelling tool increases the capability to\u000a      faithfully replicate real world activity. In particular we have studied\u000a      Infrared missile seeker and countermeasure modelling [G1, P1, P2 and P3]\u000a      to understand the utility of launching infrared countermeasures prior to\u000a      the detection of the threat missile to enhance aircraft survivability, and\u000a      the ability to combat the more advanced missile systems that are becoming\u000a      more widely proliferated in the modern battlespace.

The wind-tunnel test programme for the JSF jet effects,\u000a      involving over 4000 hours in a large multi-national facility, used a fixed\u000a      ground plane. This programme alone is estimated to have cost some &#163;5\u000a      million; a moving ground plane for such a facility would have cost an\u000a      additional &#163;4 million. Our findings allowed the fixed-ground results to be\u000a      corrected by engineers in BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin, without the\u000a      need for an expensive moving-ground simulation, [C1].\u000a    Similarly, BAE Systems used our work on wall-jet development [P2] to\u000a      predict safe operating conditions for ground personnel working in the\u000a      vicinity of a V\/STOL aircraft [C2]. Wall jets, produced by propulsion jets\u000a      hitting the ground, grow in thickness radially and with increasing nozzle\u000a      height above the ground. Our work showed that the rate of growth with\u000a      nozzle height is not linear, contrary to extrapolations from\u000a      previously-published data, and that above about 10 nozzle diameters the\u000a      growth rate of the wall jet reduces significantly. This allowed much more\u000a      accurate predictions of the thickness of the wall jet produced by a\u000a      landing aircraft. This, in turn, allows smaller exclusion zones for ground\u000a      personnel and, hence, allows a less restrictive operating envelope for the\u000a      aircraft.\u000a    Our research on jet\/intake interactions showed that there was a mutual\u000a      aerodynamic interference which would not have been accounted for by\u000a      separate powered wind-tunnel model and independent intake tests.\u000a      Nevertheless, this effect was shown to be sufficiently small that it did\u000a      not require the expense and complexity of fully-powered wind-tunnel models\u000a      with simulated jets and intakes to be mounted on force balances [C1].\u000a      These results fed into the development of the JSF to provide confidence in\u000a      the separate testing of jets and intakes. A combined model, with both\u000a      powered jets and powered intakes, would have been impractical and would\u000a      have cost more than &#163;1M. Our research saved this expense and gave\u000a      designers increased confidence in the validity of their design, mitigating\u000a      the risk of an overly restrictive operating envelope for the aircraft.\u000a      Overall, an improved, more accurate design process allows for a shortened\u000a      flight-test programme. For a complex V\/STOL aircraft like the JSF, even a\u000a      straightforward flight-test programme costs more than &#163;100M; many times\u000a      more if poor design decisions have been taken.\u000a    Cranfield's work on co-annular jet flows led to the conclusion that a\u000a      gas-driven lift fan, producing a jet with a high-speed outer stream and a\u000a      lower-speed inner stream, was not a viable solution for a V\/STOL aircraft\u000a      because of thrust loss when close to the ground. This allowed government\u000a      and industry to drop this as a design possibility, saving many &#163;billions\u000a      in wasted development costs, [C3].\u000a    The impact of Cranfield's research was enhanced by the delivery of a\u000a      series of continuing professional development courses to engineers and\u000a      project managers from industry and government agencies. The course,\u000a      \"Fundamentals of V\/STOL Aircraft Design with Joint Strike Fighter\u000a      Applications\", has so far been delivered by international experts eight\u000a      times in the UK and the US, with Cranfield staff delivering lectures on\u000a      V\/STOL jet effects. The most recent courses ran in Fort Worth, Texas\u000a      (2009), home of Lockheed Martin's Joint Strike Fighter engineering and\u000a      assembly facility, and in Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Maryland (2010\u000a      [C4]), where the Joint Strike Fighter is undergoing flight testing. More\u000a      than 300 delegates, primarily from industry and government agencies,\u000a      attended these courses, which provided both broad and deep knowledge of\u000a      the varied technical aspects of V\/STOL jet aircraft design. The courses\u000a      raised the competence levels of the design teams and helped them to ensure\u000a      the validity of their designs [C1].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Cranfield University has conducted research in jet aerodynamics,\u000a      particularly for vertical or short take-off and landing (V\/STOL) aircraft\u000a      applications, for more than 20 years, with funding from the aerospace\u000a      industry, MoD and RCUK, making a major contribution to the continuing\u000a      development of the new Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.\u000a    The impact of the research has been:\u000a    \u000a      savings of many &#163;M in development costs of the Lockheed Martin F-35B\u000a        (Joint Strike Fighter) by reducing the development time, improving\u000a        safety with less restrictive operating conditions, and enabling better\u000a        design decisions.\u000a      a series of continuing professional development courses on V\/STOL\u000a        aircraft design delivered internationally to more than 300 engineers and\u000a        managers.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    10007822\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Cranfield University","InstitutionName":"Cranfield University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"East","UKPRN":10007822}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"4361885","Name":"Maryland"}],"References":"\u000a    Evidence of quality &#8212; Peer reviewed journal papers\u000a    \u000aP1* Ground Vortex Formed by Impinging Jets in Cross-flow.

In particular, in vertical flight\u000a      the lifting jets point downwards and the entrained air flow induces a\u000a      download on the airframe. This download is exacerbated close to the ground\u000a      when the lift jets hit the ground and spread out to flow radially. This\u000a      so-called wall jet has a number of consequences:\u000a    \u000a      it increases the entrained flow and, hence, the download on the\u000a        airframe;\u000a      it carries hot engine exhaust gases towards the engine intakes;\u000a      in a relative head-wind the wall jet can separate from the ground and\u000a        form an unsteady ground vortex that surrounds the aircraft, carrying hot\u000a        gases towards the engine intakes and changing the air-loads on the\u000a        airframe.\u000a    \u000a    Understanding the characteristics of the wall jet and ground vortex &#8212; and\u000a      how they vary with operating and design conditions &#8212; is crucial for the\u000a      efficient design and safe operation of jet-lift V\/STOL aircraft.\u000a    Over the past 20 years Cranfield University has studied jet-induced\u000a      flowfields with the aim of understanding and reducing the adverse effects\u000a      of these flows on V\/STOL aircraft. Our projects have addressed various\u000a      flow phenomena, including the development of wall jets from single and\u000a      multiple impinging jets [P2], jet\/intake interactions [P3, P6], jet mixing\u000a      [G1, P6], coannular impinging jets, mean and fluctuating flowfields\u000a      associated with the ground vortex [G2, P1, P4], and unsteady fountain\u000a      flows [G3, P5].\u000a    Our initial studies were aimed at understanding factors that controlled\u000a      the location and size of the ground vortex formed when a jet hits the\u000a      ground in a cross-flow [P1]. Our results quantified the differences\u000a      between impingement on fixed and moving ground planes, confirmed\u000a      self-similarity rules for the size of the ground vortex, revealed the\u000a      levels of unsteadiness of the ground vortex, and presented initial\u000a      findings on multiple jet interactions in cross-flows. This work led us to\u000a      more detailed studies of some of the fundamental flow features involved,\u000a      starting with the wall jet that feeds the ground vortex.\u000a    In the next stage of our research we investigated wall-jet flows produced\u000a      by jets hitting the ground [P2]. This showed the influence of initial free-jet conditions on the\u000a      development of the wall jet, and the significance of the angle at which\u000a      the free jet strikes the ground on the growth of the wall jet. This led to\u000a      Cranfield's subsequent studies on the detailed flowfields produced by\u000a      multiple impinging jets [P5].\u000a    In parallel with our fundamental wall jet studies, we conducted\u000a      more-applied research into the mutual interference between free-jet\u000a      entrainment flowfields and aircraft intake-induced flows [P3, P6].\u000a    More recently Cranfield has used laser-based flow measurement techniques\u000a      to investigate unsteady features of the ground vortex [G2, P4] and the\u000a      fountain upwash flow produced by multiple impinging jets [G3, P5].

Trading as UPS2, it\u000a        is recognised by its customers as the world's leading commercial\u000a        facility [C1, C2, C3] for the supply of ultra-precision large-scale\u000a        structured drums for making structures such as lenses. UPS2 has\u000a        sold in excess of &#163;2 million of product in three years to more than 30\u000a        customers, several of which are global industrial companies with\u000a        household names, such as 3M, Samsung, Microsoft, and Amazon.\u000a      Optropreneurs Ltd was industrial co-creator of the UPS2-IKC\u000a        proposal to EPSRC [G4, G5]. In 2008, with assistance of UPS2-IKC\u000a        and based on production technology developed through the UPS project\u000a        [G2] reported in [P2], Optropreneurs secured a &#8364;5 million contract from\u000a        ESO to manufacture prototype primary mirror segments for the world's\u000a        largest telescope [C4]. ESO's European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT)\u000a        Construction Proposal [C5] identified the Cranfield Box grinding machine\u000a        for its production planning for the primary mirrors [P3,P4]. Contracts\u000a        for their manufacture will be valued at &gt; &#163;100 million to the\u000a        selected contractor.\u000a      The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), NASA's replacement for the\u000a        Hubble Space Telescope, is due to be deployed in or after 2018. A\u000a        principal aim is to find life-supporting earth-like planets. Cranfield\u000a        made more mirror surfaces for JWST than any other organisation. The\u000a        mirror surfaces (accurate to &lt; 10nm RMS) were made on machines\u000a        designed and built at Cranfield using novel machining and metrology\u000a        techniques, since copied elsewhere. The Mid InfraRed Instrument (MIRI)\u000a        made in the UK containing the Cranfield mirrors has been delivered to\u000a        NASA [C6]. This impact has been publicly recognised by NASA [C7].\u000a      A radical revision of the SI unit system is underway, involving the\u000a        redefinition of its seven base units in terms of fundamental constants.\u000a        This achievement of unprecedented low uncertainty of measurement would\u000a        have been impossible without Cranfield's research in manufacturing and\u000a        measuring [C9]. The kelvin will be defined within two years in terms of\u000a        the Boltzmann constant. A UK team, including scientists from Cranfield,\u000a        has completed the lowest uncertainty temperature measurement ever\u000a        performed, establishing a new estimate of the value of the Boltzmann\u000a        constant, which for the first time is accurate enough to meet the\u000a        kelvin's redefinition criteria. The measurement has been founded on the\u000a        accuracy of manufacturing of a new configuration of acoustic resonator\u000a        made at Cranfield, based on world-leading research in surface generation\u000a        through freeform diamond turning and freeform surface metrology.

Research in several areas of the\u000a      multi-disciplinary field of ultra-precision technology underpins this.\u000a      These include all areas of machine design and control, tool path\u000a      generation, material removal process and specialist dimensional metrology.\u000a    In 2003, the Large Optics Manufacturing Study (LOMS) was conducted for\u000a      the DTI [G1]. This research identified the market and potential UK\u000a      manufacturing capability for ultra-precise and large optics for astronomy,\u000a      lithography and power generation [P1]. LOMS led to an EPSRC grant for\u000a      research into manufacturing of ultra-precision surfaces with a novel\u000a      manufacturing process chain [G2]. The idea was that the exceptional\u000a      productivity from our new approach for figure accuracy at high production\u000a      rate would revolutionise the market for large optics [P2]. The Cranfield\u000a      Box machine, designed and built as the first element of this chain, has\u000a      achieved the fastest and most accurate grinding of large optics reported\u000a      [P3] at sub-micron RMS figure error for 1.5 metre freeform optics, with\u000a      the lowest sub-surface damage depth [P4].\u000a    Parallel research into the production of freeform optics by diamond\u000a      turning [G3] led to a capability to manufacture surfaces which are not\u000a      rotationally symmetric whilst possessing exceptionally good figure\u000a      accuracy and smooth surface texture [P5].\u000a    Key infrastructure funded through SRIF was pivotal in developing new\u000a      surface metrology techniques, without which the advancements in surface\u000a      manufacture could not have been achieved. These metrology techniques\u000a      included surface conformal interferometric co-ordinate metrology in\u000a      support of multi-mirror array measurement [P6], low-uncertainty high\u000a      density scanned surface mapping for error compensated diamond turning [P5]\u000a      and thermally compensated surface mapping for freeform ground surfaces\u000a      [P3].\u000a    The integration of these research strands into a more powerful\u000a      combination led to a proposal for an EPSRC Integrated Knowledge Centre\u000a      (IKC) in Ultra Precision and Structured Surfaces (UPS2)\u000a      [G4,G5]. This centre, funded from 2007 until late 2012, performed nearer\u000a      market research at relatively high technology readiness level in optical\u000a      and related surface production technology with a focus on IP generation,\u000a      spin-out potential and business engagement, moving toward commercial\u000a      impact in the manufacture of high-value products. One significant\u000a      programmed activity of the UPS2 IKC was to perform industrial\u000a      research into the manufacture of ultra-precise surface structuring master\u000a      roll mould tools. The need for these tools reflects a shift in mass\u000a      production of precise high-value products away from the step-and-repeat\u000a      process currently used to make microelectronic, display and area-optical\u000a      products towards a continuous reel-to-reel approach.\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Key Researchers\u000a          Post details and dates involved\u000a          Research\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Prof P Shore\u000a          Professor (2003-present)\u000a          Machine design, material removal\u000a            process\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          P Morantz\u000a          Senior Research Fellow (1999-2007);\u000a            Principal Research Fellow (2007-\u000a            present)\u000a          Machine design, control, tool-path\u000a            generation, material removal\u000a            process, dimensional metrology\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          J Allsop\u000a          Senior Research Fellow\/UPS2\u000a            Manager (2008-present)\u000a          Tool path generation, material\u000a            removal process\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr X Tonnellier\u000a          Research Assistant (2005-2009);\u000a            Research Officer (2009-present)\u000a          Material removal process\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr P Comley\u000a          Senior Research Fellow (2008-present)\u000a          Material removal process\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17852","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Composites are now widely used in aircraft &#8212; the Boeing 787 Dreamliner\u000a      uses 50% composites [C1]. The tufted composite braces, based on\u000a      technologies developed at Cranfield, are the first use of structural\u000a      composites in the landing gear of a commercial aircraft (figure 2). The\u000a      use of Cranfield's tufting technology to assemble and reinforce the\u000a      sub-components of the 3D woven preform has enabled Aircelle and MBD to\u000a      achieve their goals in terms of material performance [C2, 7].\u000a    \u000a    Figure 2: Detail of the landing gear of the Boeing 787 (the composite\u000a        braces are shown in black).\u000a    \u000a    The advantages of composites over the traditional steel components are:\u000a      weight saving due to improved strength-to-weight ratio of the constituent\u000a      material, which become significant considering that each Boeing 787 is\u000a      equipped with eight such braces; higher resistance to corrosion, reducing\u000a      maintenance work and servicing costs; higher resistance to fatigue;\u000a      greater in-service reliability; and longer service time between overhauls.\u000a      Ultimately the weight saving gives benefits in reduced fuel burn and CO2\u000a      emissions, and better competitiveness for the manufacturer.\u000a    A traditional laminated composite could not bear the complex axial and\u000a      shear loading pattern expected in such a critical structure, or withstand\u000a      impact from potential bird strikes or debris flying from a runway. The\u000a      adoption of a composite structure with a 3D fibre architecture was,\u000a      therefore, an essential requirement in the material selection for the\u000a      composite brace.\u000a    Three-dimensional weaving technologies allow the production of preforms\u000a      with fibres arranged along three main directions, however, complex shapes\u000a      are difficult to produce in a single step. The preform for the brace had\u000a      to be manufactured as two subcomponents, subsequently tufted together. The\u000a      option of using tufting within such an innovative manufacturing process\u000a      had never been attempted before. Cranfield had to conduct several\u000a      preliminary trials and tests on simple preforms to assess the tufting unit\u000a      ability to produce the required result. (Figure 3 shows an example of the\u000a      use of tufting in a complex aerospace component.)\u000a\u0009  \u000a    Figure 3: Tufting robot at Cranfield inserting tufts in a\u000a        double-curvature surface.\u000a    \u000a    The preformed part was manufactured at Aircelle as two subsections of 3D\u000a      woven carbon-fibre tows around a core of aluminium honeycomb. However, the\u000a      designers required extra fibre reinforcement to be inserted\u000a      through-the-thickness of the preform to join the two subsections and to\u000a      enhance its damage tolerance. Cranfield's research showed that it could\u000a      meet these requirements, demonstrating the improvement in terms of\u000a      delamination resistance provided by tufting. This was established with the\u000a      investigation of the influence of tufting incorporation on interlaminar\u000a      behaviour, showing improvements in delamination toughness in the range of\u000a      60%-400%, whilst preserving in-plane properties, and the development of\u000a      validated predictive models enabling consideration of property\u000a      modification to be integrated within the design phase [C6].\u000a    The prototypes have gone into full production by Messier-Bugatti-Dowty\u000a      and are currently flying on the world's fleet of Boeing 787s [C7]. The\u000a      value to business can be appreciated by considering that landing gear\u000a      typically comprises 2% of the cost of wide body jets. The price of the 787\u000a      is estimated at $200M and the current (2013) cumulative orders are circa\u000a      930 aircraft. The contract to supply Boeing Commercial aircraft was a\u000a      first for Safran \/ Messier-Bugatti-Dowty and secures workshare for up to\u000a      20 years. The extensive use of composite materials for the airframe of\u000a      this the new aircraft has brought benefits of weight reduction and\u000a      consequent fuel economy. The Cranfield work has now extended the use of\u000a      these materials into critical landing gear systems giving Messier-\u000a      Bugatti-Dowty access to similar weight reducing advantages to their\u000a      products [C3-5, 7].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Components built using 3D composite manufacturing methods developed by\u000a      Cranfield are now flying on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

It used an\u000a      industrial sewing head to create 3D (z-direction) reinforcement in\u000a      addition to the traditional layers and winding, to improve shear and\u000a      delamination resistance. In 2005, an interface between a robot and the\u000a      tufting tool was added, along with the software routines enabling its\u000a      practical use for composite preform reinforcement.\u000a    Cranfield had investigated stitching of dry preform plies in the previous\u000a      decades. However, at the beginning of this century there was no systematic\u000a      research work dedicated to tufting as a method for reinforcing composites,\u000a      through-thickness. Cranfield published the outcome of the initial work in\u000a      2007 in the first two papers dedicated to this technology [P1, 2].\u000a    In 2006 Boeing wanted to replace a heavy metal structure with a lighter\u000a      composite alternative. The objective was to meet the stringent performance\u000a      requirement for a structure that would be used within the 787 Dreamliner's\u000a      landing gear. When Aircelle and Messier-Bugatti-Dowty (MBD), parts of the\u000a      Safran aerospace group, approached Cranfield, tufting capabilities were\u000a      limited to processing flat preforms that inserted glass fibre or aramid\u000a      thread tufts through relatively small thicknesses of material (up to\u000a      38mm). Nevertheless, the specifics of the component made it impossible for\u000a      the through-thickness reinforcement to be carried out with any other form\u000a      of stitching apart from tufting. Aircelle wanted to use a carbon-fibre\u000a      thread to form tuft loops fully embedded within the thick shaft of a 1.2m\u000a      long brace with large lugs at each end. Cranfield therefore embarked on a\u000a      research programme to investigate the potential for tufting using carbon\u000a      fibre threads. Our research met these requirements, demonstrating the\u000a      improvement in terms of delamination resistance provided by tufting [P3,\u000a      6].\u000a    \u000a    Figure 1: Tufted composite brace, 1.2m long, exhibited at the\u000a        Farnborough Air Show (September 2012)\u000a\u0009\u0009http:\/\/www.compositesworld.com\/articles\/2008-farnborough-airshow-report\u000a        (accessed 20\/11\/13)\u000a    \u000a    Cranfield's researchers tackled several challenges, starting with the\u000a      requirement to use a carbon fibre thread which, at the time, was not\u000a      readily available on the market. All available grades were too brittle to\u000a      withstand needle penetration through tight preforms. The size and shape of\u000a      the preform and the particular material combination of the part demanded\u000a      novel customised hardware arrangements for the tufting unit, as well as\u000a      the development of dedicated controlling routines.\u000a    We identified an innovative carbon-fibre thread (at the time still under\u000a      development by Toho Tenax) and acquired and successfully tested the\u000a      material on Cranfield's tufting system. Cranfield undertook innovative\u000a      modifications to the robot setup to accommodate the large preform and\u000a      developed the routines to enable tufts insertion on complex double\u000a      curvature surfaces. These developments were based on Cranfield's\u000a      exploratory research on the feasibility of the technology [P1] and its\u000a      optimal utilisation for enhancing mechanical performance [P2]. The\u000a      prototypes were impregnated with thermoset resin after tufting and\u000a      mechanically assessed by Aircelle. The company now produces carbon fibre\u000a      braces reinforced by tufting with carbon thread (figure 1) in its premises\u000a      with a newly acquired twin-robot tufting cell. These landing gear systems\u000a      have been flying on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner since its maiden flight in\u000a      2010.\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Key Researcher\u000a          Post details\u000a          Dates involved\u000a          Research\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr. G.

What we can provide, detailed below,\u000a        is an explanation of the context in which the work has been applied, and\u000a        quotes from senior individuals at AWE, attesting to the impact of this\u000a        research on their work.\u000a    Accurate computer modelling is needed to underwrite the safety and\u000a      performance of nuclear weapons. Instabilities and turbulent mixing at\u000a      material interfaces is one area where better understanding is essential\u000a      [C1]. A decade ago, the type of \"Large Eddy Simulation\" used at AWE to\u000a      gain a fundamental understanding of the mixing processes was much\u000a      criticised by the academic community with respect to its ability to\u000a      capture accurately the correct turbulent-flow physics.\u000a    The numerical methods developed at Cranfield University have been used by\u000a      AWE to investigate the influence of initial conditions of mixing due to\u000a      Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. Turbulence modelling simulations often\u000a      ignore the influence of initial conditions on turbulent mixing, so\u000a      Cranfield's work has a substantial impact in reducing computational\u000a      uncertainty in turbulent mixing predictions and is now taken into account\u000a      in AWE's modelling.\u000a    \"The collaboration between AWE and Cranfield University, which has\u000a        involved simulation methods at both institutions and experiments at AWE,\u000a        has led to a high degree of confidence in the computer modelling we now\u000a        use to understand turbulent mixing.\" [C2, C4]\u000a    The methods developed at Cranfield have also been used for 3D simulation\u000a      of complex flows where mixing is on average two-dimensional. These results\u000a      have led to a substantial advance with respect to validation and\u000a      verification of computational models by improving the accuracy of\u000a      engineering turbulence models (Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes models)\u000a      used in ICF applications at AWE.\u000a    During the course of this research, a key improvement was made by\u000a      Cranfield to the Godunov methods used at Cranfield to simulate\u000a      compressible turbulent flow, in particular the behaviour at low Mach\u000a      number. This improvement significantly increases the accuracy of\u000a      computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes in turbulent flow simulations.\u000a      Furthermore, it enhances the efficiency of CFD codes because high accuracy\u000a      can be attained even with low numerical grid resolution, thus leading to\u000a      shorter computing times.\u000a    Low-Mach corrections developed at Cranfield &#8212; as well as variants of\u000a      Cranfield's work produced by other research groups &#8212; are now employed in\u000a      CFD codes in the German Aerospace Agency DLR [C5], Pennsylvania State\u000a      University [C6] and the French Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique [C7].\u000a      These organisations use these CFD codes for flows ranging from turbulence\u000a      mixing through to scramjets.\u000a    Cranfield's work has inspired further developments in the international\u000a      research community, eg, the French nuclear hydraulics code FLICA-OVAP and\u000a      at Tsinghua (China) in relation to turbine blades A related area of\u000a      physics that is also of concern to AWE is dynamic friction at material\u000a      interfaces under extreme conditions of velocity and normal stress. AWE's\u000a      previous modelling using continuum hydrocodes, and work at the US Los\u000a      Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) using molecular dynamics simulations,\u000a      had produced conflicting predictions of behaviours in this regime.

Modelling to understand instabilities and\u000a      turbulent mixing at material interfaces is an area that demands better\u000a      understanding.\u000a    Cranfield's work on CFD (2004 to date) concerns:\u000a    \u000a      the development of computational fluid dynamics methods, turbulence\u000a        models and engineering physics studies of instabilities\u000a        (Richtmyer-Meshkov and Rayleigh-Taylor) and compressible turbulent\u000a        mixing; and\u000a      development of multi-scale methods and study of dynamic friction\u000a        across material interfaces.\u000a    \u000a    The research is motivated by a range of diverse applications in science\u000a      and engineering, including: inertial confinement fusion (ICF); micro and\u000a      nanocrystalline materials and interfacial friction in materials; nuclear\u000a      energy; detonation; supersonic combustion; and astrophysics.\u000a    In ICF, the main area of application of the research, the dense shell,\u000a      filled with deuterium-tritium (DT) gas, implodes when irradiated by laser\u000a      beams or by other means. When a shock wave refracts through the shell-fuel\u000a      interface, the boundary experiences Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI).\u000a      RMI leads to the growth of perturbations on the shell-fuel interface and\u000a      causes turbulent mixing of the materials. Rayleigh-Taylor instability\u000a      (RTI) and mixing also occurs at the shell-fuel interface towards the end\u000a      of the implosion phase, when the less dense gas decelerates the shell. RMI\u000a      and RTI turbulent mixing reduce the heating of the gas during the\u000a      implosion phase and inhibit the thermonuclear reaction after ignition,\u000a      degrading the performance of the ICF target. Accurate modelling of RMI and\u000a      RTI is a major uncertainty in calculating how an ICF target will behave.\u000a    In the framework of the present research, Cranfield developed new\u000a      high-resolution and high-order computational methods that improve the\u000a      accuracy in compressible turbulent mixing simulations [P1, P2, P3]. The\u000a      results from the simulation and modelling studies were validated against\u000a      specially designed experiments performed at AWE, as well as simulation and\u000a      modelling data using AWE's industrial codes. Cranfield investigated the\u000a      influence of the initial conditions on RMI, RTI and turbulent mixing in a\u000a      range of ICF mixing problems.\u000a    In the course of the research [P4, P5], Cranfield also developed\u000a      multi-scale models that couple continuum and molecular dynamics methods in\u000a      order to study dynamic friction between material interfaces. Friction at\u000a      the interface between dissimilar metallic components as a result of high\u000a      velocity impact or explosive loading can have a profound effect on the\u000a      subsequent motion. A comprehensive understanding of the processes involved\u000a      across a wide range of initial conditions is still not available. This\u000a      research revealed the growth of epitaxial layers of the softer material,\u000a      shifting of the sliding interface due to formation of shear-bands,\u000a      development of amorphous structures, and ultimately the resultant motion\u000a      of the components. Analysis of the results also linked these processes to\u000a      the changes in the state of the material through growth of dislocations\u000a      and thermal effects [P5].\u000a    The research enhanced our understanding in compressible turbulent mixing\u000a      and dynamic friction, which are core activities of AWE's technical\u000a      programme.\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Key Researchers\u000a          Post details\u000a          Dates involved\u000a          Research\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr Ben Thornber\u000a          Research Fellow\/Lecturer\u000a          2004 - 2013\u000a          Compressible turbulent mixing, CFD\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr Marco Hahn\u000a          Research Fellow\/Lecturer\u000a          2004 - 2010\u000a          Compressible turbulent mixing, CFD\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Prof Dimitris Drikakis\u000a          Professor\u000a          2003 - present\u000a          Turbulent mixing, CFD, multi-scale modelling, dynamic friction,\u000a            engineering turbulence modelling\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17856","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Cranfield icing research programme has comprised mathematical models,\u000a      high quality computer code and experimental validation data which has\u000a      become part of the design and certification processes for major parts of\u000a      the UK\/European aerospace industry. Specific details are company\u000a      confidential, since they form part of the core business processes; three\u000a      statements from the technical leads in major organisations explain how the\u000a      work has had impact.\u000a    Airbus [C1]\u000a    Airbus uses the computational and experimental aircraft icing programmes,\u000a      including developments of the ICECREMO programs, as part of all major\u000a      development programmes. The annual expenditure of these programmes is\u000a      several billion euros. The codes support design decisions relating to ice\u000a      risks associated with regions where air flow is strongly three\u000a      dimensional. The certifying authorities accept this type of analysis as\u000a      part of the certification documentation [C2].\u000a    Since 2008, Airbus programmes where ICECREMO derivatives have been\u000a      extensively employed include A350, A400M and the A320 (new engine option).\u000a      In the case of the A400M, Airbus used the work by Hammond and Al&#232;gre [P6]\u000a      to justify how ice formed by runback water (runback ice) is represented on\u000a      a sub-scale wind tunnel model. In 2006, Airbus performed the final A400M\u000a      Wind Tunnel test, which included runs to investigate the sensitivity to\u000a      the aircraft handling qualities to runback ice. Those wind tunnel tests\u000a      demonstrate the most critical ice shape and also justify that the wing\u000a      performance is acceptable even when degraded by the icing degraded wing\u000a      anti-icing performance is acceptable, in terms of the effect of any\u000a      runback ice on an aircraft's handling qualities. Runback ice shapes were\u000a      generated in the Cranfield Wind Tunnel and the experiments showed that\u000a      using surface roughness alone resulted in a similar disturbance to the\u000a      boundary layer as the moulding of runback ice taken from the wind tunnel\u000a      validating the experimental approach. Airbus also used this work to show\u000a      that for the A350 it was appropriate to apply roughness elements smaller\u000a      than 3mm to runback ice shapes. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)\u000a      gave icing clearance certification by June 2013.\u000a    A further example of the use of ICECREMO is in a response to a challenge\u000a      Airbus received from the airworthiness authorities. The US FAA asked\u000a      Airbus to justify the use of 2D icing codes to predict ice on the A350\u000a      wing. The FAA suggested that Airbus could make comparisons against a 3D\u000a      code. Airbus compared the droplet catch efficiencies with another code\u000a      (from ONERA) and ice shapes with those from ICECREMO, demonstrating good\u000a      agreement between both codes. This satisfied the FAA that in using 2D\u000a      icing codes we were adequately capturing the 3D effects of ice accretion\u000a      on a swept\/tapered\/twisted wing. The ICECREMO comparisons were presented\u000a      to EASA and the FAA on 2nd March 2010. They were satisfied with\u000a      the Airbus response. This was a key milestone in the certification\u000a      process: type certification is expected in the middle of 2014.\u000a    BAE Systems [C3]\u000a    BAE Systems has made extensive use of technology and software developed\u000a      within ICECREMO 2, to support internal programmes and to provide\u000a      consultancy to outside organisations.\u000a    Internal programmes to BAE supported by this technology include:\u000a    \u000a      Herti UAV (sensor placement and airframe icing analysis), 2011\u000a      Mantis UAV (sensor placement and airframe icing analysis), 2011\u000a      Support to general research activities, including novel ice protection\u000a        systems 2005-07\/2013\u000a    \u000a    Code use and support for external customers including icing analysis of\u000a      2008-07\/2013:\u000a    \u000a      Fuel tank vents\u000a      Intake ducts\u000a      Deployed slats and flaps\u000a      Fairings\u000a    \u000a    These are examples of business which would not have been possible without\u000a      the original ICECREMO technology development. Direct contract work\u000a      undertaken by BAE Systems associated with these programmes is estimated to\u000a      be approximately &#163;600,000.\u000a    Although the business impact is difficult to quantify, the technology has\u000a      provided a capability, through its 3D modelling ability, for assessment of\u000a      aspects of airframe design and performance not otherwise readily\u000a      achievable. ICECREMO codes have been used to provide design guidance, e.g.\u000a      specification of ice protection systems and location of icing sensors. In\u000a      addition to providing design guidance, this has a direct impact on risk\u000a      and safety assessment.\u000a    Rolls-Royce [C4]\u000a    Rolls-Royce has found the modularity and clear methodology of the\u000a      ICECREMO code especially useful in developing its own in-house analysis\u000a      tools and methods. In one form or another, the main elements of code have\u000a      been used in all current large civil aircraft projects up to and including\u000a      the Trent XWB. The methods have proved to be very valuable in supporting a\u000a      shift of emphasis of the certification process away from expensive,\u000a      on-wing and simulated altitude testing, to analysis and numerical\u000a      simulation backed up with ground testing.\u000a    It is difficult to put a figure on the economic benefit as this\u000a      capability is one of many essential to how Rolls-Royce currently works. In\u000a      essence, the level of fidelity of the company's current analysis methods\u000a      is high enough that, whilst it spends more time on analysis, the\u000a      dependence on experimental work is reduced, resulting in significant\u000a      financial savings.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Cranfield's understanding and modelling of aircraft icing, a critical\u000a      part of the safety, operation and design protocols for all types of\u000a      aircraft, has changed the way in which aerospace companies approach the\u000a      design of new aircraft.

At temperatures below -30&#176;C there\u000a      is no significant liquid water on an aircraft. At temperatures up to 5&#176;C,\u000a      ice and liquid water exist on an aircraft's surfaces. It is important to\u000a      understand the flow patterns of impacting water, where the ice forms and\u000a      how much ice forms. Knowing this, aircraft designers can then decide where\u000a      to incorporate heating to prevent the formation or build-up of ice.\u000a    Until the mid-1990s, aircraft designers used an ad hoc model that did not\u000a      correctly capture the momentum balance of the flowing water. Cranfield\u000a      developed an improved mathematical system which accurately models the\u000a      energy, momentum and conservation laws for water and ice.\u000a    The underlying model uses lubrication theory. Cranfield's researchers\u000a      enhanced this to include the freezing and melting processes and the\u000a      geometry of the airframe and its components [P1]. The boundary conditions\u000a      associated with these systems are complex, the system of differential\u000a      equations degenerates. Surface tension effects were modelled using a\u000a      pre-cursor film approach.\u000a    The nature of the flow fields observed in this class of flows are\u000a      characterised by very sharp gradients. Cranfield undertook significant\u000a      work to devise Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) schemes which provided\u000a      accurate and reliable predictions [P2-P4].\u000a    Other aspects of the research include:\u000a    \u000a      A formulation which supports rotating frames of reference (for\u000a        helicopter rotors and turbine blades).\u000a      Automatic error estimation and grid adaptivity for error control.\u000a        These features improve the usability of the code.\u000a      Support for structured grids (ICECREMO 1) and unstructured grids\u000a        (ICECREMO 2), this meant that the code could be used more easily with\u000a        complex geometries.\u000a      ICECREMO 2 included Cranfield work on ice protection &#8212; the inclusion\u000a        of heat sources used to protect critical areas. The computational model\u000a        was extended to include heating and conduction in the airframe.\u000a    \u000a    A key aspect of this work is that the code(s) developed at Cranfield have\u000a      been integrated into the design and certification processes. This forced\u000a      obvious requirements on software development standards. Moreover, the code\u000a      had to be compatible with the design codes of various collaborating\u000a      organisations. Cranfield developed number of data format translators to\u000a      support integration with commercial and in-house codes for computational\u000a      fluid dynamics; this was important to make the code accessible to industry\u000a      engineers.\u000a    Following problems in service, the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA)\u000a      led an activity to expand icing requirements to force aircraft\u000a      manufacturers to address icing due to larger droplets such as freezing\u000a      drizzle. To support this activity, Cranfield undertook research projects\u000a      to provide experimental data and analysis on large droplet icing. This\u000a      work has shown how larger droplets impact different areas of the airframe\u000a      and have different splash characteristics. This data has allowed ice\u000a      prediction codes, such as ICECREMO, to be adapted to improve their\u000a      accuracy for larger droplets.

Specific fuel consumption (SFC) has been reduced by over 1% [P2, P3]\u000d\u000a      with consequent CO2 reduction, by introducing doped TBCs,\u000d\u000a      involving the incorporation of Lanthanide-based oxides.\u000d\u000a    TBC technology has allowed Rolls-Royce to not only maintain, but increase\u000d\u000a      its market share for large civil aircraft engines [C2]. To support the\u000d\u000a      introduction and application of advanced thermal barrier coatings in the\u000d\u000a      Trent family of engines, Rolls-Royce plc entered a joint venture with\u000d\u000a      Chromalloy (UK) Ltd, to build a new coating facility in Nottinghamshire,\u000d\u000a      UK. The facility, Turbine Surface Technologies Ltd., will undertake all\u000d\u000a      coating manufacture with these advanced compositions, ensuring the I.P. is\u000d\u000a      protected for the UK [C3]. The adoption of `power by the hour'\u000d\u000a      (availability based) services further protects this technology by ensuring\u000d\u000a      only Rolls-Royce plc approved contractors undertake any engine\u000d\u000a      maintenance.\u000d\u000a    Through the adoption of Cranfield's `low K' thermal barrier coating\u000d\u000a      technologies, the thermal conductivity of such EB-PVD TBCs is reduced from\u000d\u000a      1.8-2.0W\/mK to 1.0-1.2W\/mK, permitting a 170oC temperature drop\u000d\u000a      across the 200&#181;m thick EB-PVD TBC. Commercial variants of these new low-K\u000d\u000a      thermal barrier coatings are now specified and implemented on the\u000d\u000a      Rolls-Royce Trent engine series, the most powerful of the Rolls-Royce\u000d\u000a      engines [C3, C4]. Further, a net result of adopting this new technology\u000d\u000a      will be the growth in Rolls-Royce market share of the large civil engine\u000d\u000a      market. This is accepted by Rolls-Royce [C4] but its value is commercially\u000d\u000a      sensitive.\u000d\u000a    A series of new multi-layered coatings for engine test have been produced\u000d\u000a      by Cranfield and have been run in Rolls-Royce development engines [G5,\u000d\u000a      C3], proving the technology for incorporation in future high performance\u000d\u000a      Trent family (Trent 1000 and Trent XWB) engines.\u000d\u000a    The `Carbon Brainprint' case study [C1, 5], quantified the long-term\u000d\u000a      impact of Cranfield's thermal barrier coating research for two Rolls-Royce\u000d\u000a      engines used in large civil aircraft:\u000d\u000a    - Trent 700, introduced 1995, used on about half the Airbus A330 aircraft\u000d\u000a      currently in service;\u000d\u000a    - Trent 500, introduced 2002, used on all Airbus A340-500 and A360-600\u000d\u000a      aircraft.\u000d\u000a    In fuel costs alone, the whole-life saving amounts to &#163;3.4 billion to the\u000d\u000a      aircraft operators, in addition to saving 14MtCO2e in\u000d\u000a      greenhouse gas emissions over the 20 year life of these engines. Using the\u000d\u000a      data from the `Carbon Brainprint' case study [C1,5] an estimate of the\u000d\u000a      commercial benefits over the time frame of REF'14 has been made. First,\u000d\u000a      the level of greenhouse gas emissions has been considered, in order of\u000d\u000a      magnitude: carbon dioxide from combustion of the fuel, emissions during\u000d\u000a      extraction and refining of the fuel, and emissions of the other greenhouse\u000d\u000a      gases during combustion. The best estimates of the current emissions [P6]\u000d\u000a      for individual aircraft were as follows:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          \u000d\u000a          A330\u000d\u000a          A340-500\u000d\u000a          A340-600\u000d\u000a          Total fleet\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          tCO2e\/year\u000d\u000a          1016\u000d\u000a          1574\u000d\u000a\u0009\u0009  1646\u000d\u000a          568,000\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Thus over the period Jan 2008 to July 2013, for these two engines on\u000d\u000a      three aircraft platforms, the savings is already 3.12MtCO2e (in\u000d\u000a      fuel cost terms, a &#163;750 million saving to the fuel bill).\u000d\u000a    Looking to the future, including all the aircraft on order, the\u000d\u000a      prospective emissions reduction is 833ktCO2e\/year. Assuming a\u000d\u000a      service life of 20 years, then the total saving is approximately 17MtCO2e\u000d\u000a      or saving &#163;1.15 billion in fuel cost terms. Two adjustments are made:\u000d\u000a    - a reduction in effectiveness of 18%, assuming that older\u000d\u000a      engines do not and will not benefit from the improvement to thermal\u000d\u000a      resistance as a result of this technology;\u000d\u000a    - but the effect of emissions at high altitude would increase the\u000d\u000a      calculated benefits to 26.6MtCO2e, over the period considered\u000d\u000a      in REF'14, a total saving &#163;1.8 billion in fuel cost.\u000d\u000a    The phosphorescent `self diagnostic' TBCs are marketed by Southside\u000d\u000a      Thermal Science (STS) Ltd, a spin-out company based at Imperial College\u000d\u000a      [C6]. With the TBS technology it is possible to measure remote, real-time,\u000d\u000a      non-contact on-line temperatures in harsh conditions such as through\u000d\u000a      flames, without disrupting gas flow, which could not be done with\u000d\u000a      traditional methods. The accuracy is better than 5&#176;C. The method allows\u000d\u000a      industrial users of high temperature processes new ways of monitoring,\u000d\u000a      controlling and tuning their burners and flow paths. In a further\u000d\u000a      cooperative development with RWE npower, LAND Instruments and Cranfield\u000d\u000a      University, temperature measurements were carried out at Cranfield in a\u000d\u000a      Viper engine on nozzle guide vanes, in a combustion chamber and on rotor\u000d\u000a      blades rotating up to 13,500 rotations per minute, [C6-8]. STS in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Cranfield was granted a worldwide patent for the method\u000d\u000a      [C9].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    New low thermal conductivity (low K) barrier coatings, developed at\u000d\u000a      Cranfield, reduce specific fuel consumption by over 1%.

Cranfield's research into improved\u000d\u000a      manufacturing methods, particularly the EB-PVD process route, and the\u000d\u000a      microstructure and chemistry of the coatings produced, saw this drop to\u000d\u000a      1.65W\/mK for a 200&#181;m thick TBC [G1, G2, P1]. This was achieved through\u000d\u000a      control of deposition temperature and bond coat surface roughness [G4],\u000d\u000a      both of which directly affected the microstructure produced, plus\u000d\u000a      elaboration of deposition models applicable to the deposition of zirconia\u000d\u000a      ceramic. Control of the microstructure allowed control of the vacancy\u000d\u000a      concentration introduced and thus phonon scattering within various depths\u000d\u000a      of the zirconia TBC microstructure. Later, research into various\u000d\u000a      Lanthanide additions, including Erbium, Ytterbium, Neodynium, and\u000d\u000a      Gadolinium, and the combined use of multiple Lanthanide group oxides saw\u000d\u000a      this reduce to 1.2W\/mK, through tertiary and quaternary element size\u000d\u000a      effects further altering phonon and photon scattering within the ceramic\u000d\u000a      layer, thus lowering the thermal conductivity (figure 1) [G3,G4,P2-4].\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a    Figure 1: An aerofoil coated with a low K thermal barrier doped with\u000d\u000a        Erbia at Cranfield\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Recently, Cranfield developed periodically layered TBCs, using a multiple\u000d\u000a      source with jumping beam electron beam evaporation methods, through the\u000d\u000a      modification of the nanostructure. This has resulted in a further\u000d\u000a      reduction in thermal conductivity, now achieving 0.9-1.0W\/mK [G5]. This\u000d\u000a      coating method has been developed to a capability of pilot plant coating\u000d\u000a      manufacture that meets manufacturing performance criteria suitable for\u000d\u000a      testing in test-bed operational gas turbine engines.\u000d\u000a    The most recent extension to this work uses the phosphorescent properties\u000d\u000a      of Lanthanide oxides when in a suitable host lattice such as Zirconia.\u000d\u000a      This has permitted the development of `self diagnostic' TBC systems [P5,\u000d\u000a      P6, G6]. These smart TBCs have the ability of measuring their operating\u000d\u000a      temperature in-situ. It can be read externally and remote from the\u000d\u000a      material surface allowing a direct measurement of temperature on a\u000d\u000a      rotating turbine blade. This latest innovation has been recognised through\u000d\u000a      two technical prizes; the `Charles Sharpe Beecher' prize of the\u000d\u000a      Institution of Mechanical Engineers for 2002 [P5] and the `Best Technical\u000d\u000a      Paper Award' of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for 2008\u000d\u000a      [P6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18031","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Cranfield's research into gas metal-arc welding has led to new ways of\u000a      connecting and repairing subsea pipelines that are changing the nature of\u000a      off-shore hydrocarbon operations. The technology allows pipeline\u000a      operations in increasingly deeper waters, making it possible for the\u000a      development of previously inaccessible hydrocarbon reserves.\u000a    The continuous increase in demand for oil and natural gas resulted in\u000a      sustained growth of off-shore oil and gas production. Offshore crude oil\u000a      production can be broadly classified in three categories based on the\u000a      depth of water; shallow water (&lt; 400 m), deep water (400 to 1500 m) and\u000a      ultra-deep water (&gt; 1500 m). Since the mid-1960s, the rate of offshore\u000a      production of oil and natural gas growth was on a rise till about middle\u000a      of 1990s, when offshore production reached a plateau. This could be\u000a      attributed to the depletion of fossil fuel in the shallow water region as\u000a      deep-sea exploration showed a significant growth during that period.\u000a      Concurrently deep-water recovery has dramatically increased and now\u000a      comprises more than 20% of total offshore production. This figure is\u000a      likely to rise significantly over the coming decades as shallow reserves\u000a      are further depleted.\u000a    Critical to all offshore oil and gas recovery are pipelines for\u000a      connecting well heads and for transporting hydrocarbons to vessels or\u000a      onshore. A process known as a hot tapping is required when an operator\u000a      wants to expand the coverage of an oilfield. In this process a\u000a      T-connection is welded to an existing pipeline while oil or gas continues\u000a      to flow [C3]. In addition, subsea pipelines can require maintenance, often\u000a      requiring repair if they are suffering from, e.g. cracking due to\u000a      environmental degradation or occasional accidental damage. For larger pipe\u000a      diameters, beyond depths where divers can operate, this may be achieved by\u000a      the sleeve repair method. In this operation, the pipeline is cut, a sleeve\u000a      pre-welded onto a spool piece is slid over the subsea pipe end and this is\u000a      welded, subsea, using dry hyperbaric welding. The only viable welding\u000a      method for these operations beyond diver depths is remote dry hyperbaric\u000a      GMAW [C4]. The operation involves lowering a specially designed subsea\u000a      habitat around the pipe to be welded and filling the habitat with inert\u000a      gas to displace the water. Remotely operated tools are then used to align\u000a      the pipes, prepare the pipe surfaces before performing the welding\u000a      operation.\u000a    Following the detailed research programme and process development, subsea\u000a      remote welding equipment and welding procedures were specified by Statoil.\u000a      Offshore field trials took place in 2011 in a Norwegian Fjord at world\u000a      record depths of 350msw for the remote hot tap and 970msw for sleeve\u000a      repair. This involved further extensive detailed studies of process\u000a      sensitivity, repeatability (in all positions) and further optimisation for\u000a      both remote hot tap and sleeve repair applications at various water depths\u000a      with different consumables. In 2012, further fully integrated offshore\u000a      trials with the remote hot tap equipment, validated the welding process\u000a      for production application [C5].\u000a    Formal specifications for hyperbaric weld procedures, arising from\u000a      Cranfield's research, have now been approved by Det Norske Veritas (DNV)\u000a      for different applications as a part of a standard [C6].\u000a    The first production application was a remote hot tap installation\u000a      carried out in connection with the preparations for the &#197;sgard Subsea Gas\u000a      Compression project in the Norwegian Sea. The remote Tee was welded on to\u000a      the &#197;sgard B production flowline at a water depth of 265 metres.\u000a      Sophisticated remotely operated subsea tools and a subsea welding tool\u000a      installed the Tee on a live gas pipeline [C1, 2]. Completion of the &#197;sgard\u000a      Subsea Compression project will take place in 2015, as the first of its\u000a      kind in the world. Compressors will be installed on the seabed, instead of\u000a      on a platform. This will improve recovery from the Mikkel and Midgard\u000a      reservoirs by around 280 million barrels of oil equivalents, worth more\u000a      than 28 billion dollars at today's prices.\u000a    There are many beneficiaries of the research, both economic and\u000a      environmental. Economic benefits arise through significant additional oil\u000a      recovery. This benefits governments through taxes (including the UK), oil\u000a      &amp; gas companies through profits and society in general through lower\u000a      energy prices. Other beneficiaries include the pipeline operators who lay\u000a      and maintain pipelines and companies who manufacture and maintain the\u000a      equipment associated with the processes. Environmental benefits arise\u000a      through the ability to repair subsea structures at great depths. As\u000a      illustrated by the recent Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of\u000a      Mexico, it is difficult to deal with catastrophes of this nature at these\u000a      depths. The new repair processes developed at Cranfield provide ways to\u000a      avoid future events and to deal with them should they occur.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Automated dry hyperbaric (high pressure) gas metal-arc welding (GMAW) is\u000a      used in deep-sea pipelines for remote repair and \"hot-tap\" connections to\u000a      operating pipelines. Cranfield's process can be used for depths of up to\u000a      2,500 metres. The process has been applied in production with a new joint\u000a      being made at a depth of 265 metres on a live gas pipeline. As part of the\u000a      &#197;sgard Subsea Compression project, it will improve the recovery from the\u000a      Mikkel and Midgard reservoirs by around 280 million barrels of oil\u000a      equivalents, worth more than 28 billion dollars at today's prices.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    10007822\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Cranfield University","InstitutionName":"Cranfield University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"East","UKPRN":10007822}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    Evidence of quality &#8212; Peer reviewed journal papers\u000a    \u000aP1 * Nixon, J.H. and Richardson, I.M., `Deepwater Welding and\u000a      Intervention Technology', Underwater Technology, 21(3), pp. 3-7,\u000a      1995.\u000a      doi: 10.3723\/175605495783326432\u000a    \u000a\u000aP2 Ducharme, Ra., Kapadia, Pa.; Dowden, Jb.;\u000a      Richardson, I.M. and Thornton, M. `A Mathematical Model of TIG Electric\u000a      Arcs Operating in the Hyperbaric Range' J.

Deep-water hydrocarbon\u000a      recovery had grown steadily since 1990 to become a significant fraction of\u000a      offshore oil and gas production by this time. This production is likely to\u000a      grow significantly over the coming decade due to depletion of reserves in\u000a      shallow waters. Cranfield established a facility, unique in the world then\u000a      and now, to enable the study and development of arc welding, in all\u000a      positions, up to a gas pressure of 250 bar, equivalent to 2,500 metres\u000a      water depth (P1 &amp; G1). Following the establishment of this facility,\u000a      Cranfield conducted extensive research into gas metal arc and plasma\u000a      welding at high pressures (P2-5, G2, 3).\u000a    Cranfield's initial work focussed on the behaviour of welding arcs and\u000a      metallurgy at elevated pressures in the downhand position, i.e. the\u000a      electrode located above the job (P2, 3, 5, G2). As expected, we found\u000a      significant departures from conventional welding. At high pressures,\u000a      operating parameters are constrained by stability considerations, leaving\u000a      limited scope for weld pool and weld property modification. Despite this,\u000a      robust and tolerant GMAW and plasma operating parameters were found for\u000a      positional welding that were largely insensitive to orientation.\u000a    The problems we encountered included arc instability and poor metal\u000a      transfer characteristics due to high gas pressures, high susceptibility to\u000a      hydrogen cracking and other defects due to the high cooling rate in a\u000a      moist environment. We arrived at solutions to these problems by systematic\u000a      study of the arc characteristics, determination of thermal cycles and an\u000a      investigation of welding consumables with varying alloy compositions (P5,\u000a      G3).

In its position statement,\u000d\u000a      published at a time of unprecedented growth in the UK composting industry,\u000d\u000a      the EA had to strike an appropriate balance between: the precautionary\u000d\u000a      principle (in the absence of a strong evidence base); the commercial needs\u000d\u000a      of a burgeoning industry; and the national requirement to divert organic\u000d\u000a      waste from landfill.\u000d\u000a    Cranfield's research has informed the latest version of the EA's position\u000d\u000a      statement [C2] in several ways. Our research has shown that whilst\u000d\u000a      bioaerosol concentrations decline rapidly after emission, there are\u000d\u000a      infrequent occasions when acceptable levels are exceeded. Evidence from\u000d\u000a      our work suggests that such occasional excursions are typical of open\u000d\u000a      composting and hard to control, even at very well managed sites.\u000d\u000a      Cranfield's research informed the EA's decision (2010) to take a more\u000d\u000a      precautionary approach to permitting sites where sensitive receptors are\u000d\u000a      close to composting operations [C2]. The EA's position statement requires\u000d\u000a      the completion of risk assessments for site specific bioaerosols under\u000d\u000a      specified higher risk circumstances [C2]. The EA-funded Fellowship [G3]\u000d\u000a      developed the 2009 guidance document [C3] for the evaluation of these risk\u000d\u000a      assessments, drawing upon collaborative investigations of the quality of\u000d\u000a      assessments submitted by facility operators. In 2010-11, Cranfield staff\u000d\u000a      delivered a series of training courses for EA regulatory staff (&gt;100\u000d\u000a      attendees) on risk assessment of site specific bioaerosols [C4].\u000d\u000a    The development of source sampling close to emissions, using the IOM\u000d\u000a      sampler1, led to the inclusion of filtration sampling in the\u000d\u000a      most recent revision of the Standard Protocol for the Monitoring of\u000d\u000a      Bioaerosols at Open Composting Facilities [C5] and to Cranfield joining\u000d\u000a      the advisory group for the development of the protocol [C6]. Tyrrel is an\u000d\u000a      advisor to the EA on the development of its new M9 protocol [C6]. Tyrrel\u000d\u000a      was nominated by the Environment Agency [C1] to be the UK Principal Expert\u000d\u000a      on CEN2 TC264 Working Group 28 on bioaerosols in ambient air.\u000d\u000a      On the basis of Cranfield's research, this group has developed the first\u000d\u000a      CEN Technical Specification for the measurement of bioaerosols in ambient\u000d\u000a      air [C7] and has completed a new standard on sampling strategies for\u000d\u000a      biowaste facilities [C8]. Standardisation benefits industry and regulators\u000d\u000a      by removing uncertainty with respect to methods choice and by creating\u000d\u000a      comparable datasets.\u000d\u000a    Whilst the evidence base has been significantly strengthened in the past\u000d\u000a      ten years, there is some way to go before regulatory policy on bioaerosols\u000d\u000a      in ambient air could be considered stable. The fact that the current\u000d\u000a      position statement [C2] is referred to as \"interim\" guidance emphasises\u000d\u000a      the fact that the regulatory position is expected to change as new\u000d\u000a      information becomes available.

In the UK, the amount of waste\u000d\u000a      composted increased from 0.06 million tonnes in 1994 to 3.6 million tonnes\u000d\u000a      in 2007.\u000d\u000a    Most UK composting facilities employ mechanically turned open-air compost\u000d\u000a      piles (windrows), a technology with limited control over emissions to the\u000d\u000a      air. Composting leads to aerosol emissions in the form of microbial cells\u000d\u000a      and cell fragments which originate in the feedstock or in the composting\u000d\u000a      process. Occupational exposures to aerosols of biological origin\u000d\u000a      (bioaerosols) must be controlled to protect workers from respiratory\u000d\u000a      disease. Little was known about the extent of exposure or the potential\u000d\u000a      for health impacts for people living, studying or working near to\u000d\u000a      composting facilities.\u000d\u000a    This is a critical concern for the public; for the industry, which needs\u000d\u000a      to generate the business confidence required to secure investment in new\u000d\u000a      infrastructure (and which often faces opposition from local people at the\u000d\u000a      planning stage); for regulators which need robust evidence for\u000d\u000a      proportionate decisions; and for the delivery of Government waste\u000d\u000a      strategy.\u000d\u000a    Since 2002, Cranfield's research on bioaerosols has focussed upon\u000d\u000a      developing the evidence base needed: to understand the magnitude of, and\u000d\u000a      factors governing, the emission of bioaerosols from composting; to\u000d\u000a      characterise bioaerosol concentrations in the vicinity of composting\u000d\u000a      facilities; and, to improve the use of dispersion modelling for open\u000d\u000a      windrow composting. The new knowledge has informed national policy on the\u000d\u000a      regulation of composting facilities and supported risk assessments by site\u000d\u000a      operators and regulatory professionals. Much of this applied research has\u000d\u000a      been at operational waste management facilities. The scale, complexity and\u000d\u000a      hazardous nature of this environment have imposed significant challenges\u000d\u000a      for safe and scientifically rigorous sampling.\u000d\u000a    Initial research (2005-8 [G1]) focussed on quantification of bioaerosol\u000d\u000a      emissions from composting to improve dispersion modelling. Flux-box\u000d\u000a      techniques demonstrated that emissions from active windrow turning were up\u000d\u000a      to 1000 times greater than those from static compost piles [P1,2].\u000d\u000a      Cranfield used these findings to estimate emission fluxes from composting\u000d\u000a      operations and to generate source-depletion curves using dispersion models\u000d\u000a      [P3]. This modelling identified knowledge and information gaps, such as\u000d\u000a      high quality bioaerosol concentration dataset for composting facilities,\u000d\u000a      and set the agenda for subsequent research.\u000d\u000a    Replicated and repeated sampling (2008-11) under different meteorological\u000d\u000a      conditions on-site and downwind of two open windrow composting facilities\u000d\u000a      generated such a dataset for the first time [P6]. This dataset has\u000d\u000a      been used as part of a recently completed (2013) study funded by the EPSRC\u000d\u000a      and the Environment Agency (EA) to calibrate and validate a\u000d\u000a      well-established dispersion model for open air composting [G4]. Whilst\u000d\u000a      previous studies focused on culturable bioaerosols such as Aspergillus\u000d\u000a        fumigatus, more recent (2007-09) research extended our knowledge of\u000d\u000a      the emission and dispersal of cellular components and of the whole\u000d\u000a      microbial community. This research generated the first dataset (2011) to\u000d\u000a      compare the dispersion of endotoxin (which can stimulate the immune system\u000d\u000a      and cause inflammatory conditions if inhaled) with viable microorganisms\u000d\u000a      downwind of composting facilities [P6].\u000d\u000a    Defra funded collaborative follow-on research (2011-13) on endotoxin and\u000d\u000a      &#946; glucan at four additional composting facilities [G4]. Taken together,\u000d\u000a      this work provides new information on the emission and dispersion of cells\u000d\u000a      and cell components from composting facilities of different types.

The use of fractionation has been central to a\u000a      recent study looking at water intake contributions from different input\u000a      sources into two drinking water treatment works in the Yorkshire Water\u000a      region. The work on the role of zeta potential as a universal guide to\u000a      optimisation of coagulation now forms the basis of routine monitoring in\u000a      operating the largest drinking water works within the Severn Trent region\u000a      [C1]. The research findings have been embedded into operational practice\u000a      and have resulted in significant savings in chemicals and energy\u000a      consumption. Scottish Water recently adopted the combination of both sets\u000a      of techniques as standard tests as part of a detailed investigation\u000a      programme of its existing coagulation sites for process optimisation,\u000a      works audits and to guide investment decisions [C4]. Additionally, United\u000a      Utilities now routinely uses the tools as part of their coagulation\u000a      diagnostics in relation to problematic operational sites [C2]\u000a    The diagnostic tools have also been central to the assessment of new\u000a      technologies, such as novel magnetic ion exchange processes. This work\u000a      informed Yorkshire Water's decision in 2009 to invest &#163;50M in the\u000a      technology at three drinking water treatment sites, including the first\u000a      example of the technology to be implemented in Europe.

These projects represent some of the first\u000a      examples of such an approach: the findings of these studies are changing\u000a      the water companies' understanding of catchment management and shaping\u000a      future policy [C1].\u000a    The team's research has resulted in two novel technologies, marketed by\u000a      Water Innovate limited, part of the Bluewater Bio group [C6].\u000a    - The first is PosiDAF&#174;, a novel adaption of the dissolved air flotation\u000a      process that utilises positively charged bubbles by coating them with\u000a      either surfactants or polymers. In Australia, there is a demonstration of\u000a      the potential for Cranfield's invention for algae removal from both\u000a      drinking water sources and final effluent lagoons for wastewater\u000a      treatment. The work has industrial support from five water companies and\u000a      the Australian Research council [C7]. Cranfield continues to collaborate\u000a      through a transfer of staff to the University of New South Wales.\u000a    - The second technology is the membrane chemical reactor (MC-RTM).\u000a      This is a photocatalytic reactor linked to a membrane to ensure the\u000a      containment and reuse of nano\u000a    particulate titanium dioxide catalyst particles. The technology, patented in\u000a    2005 [C8], is under further development as part of a programme of work\u000a    funded by Severn Trent Water for the removal of a recalcitrant pesticide\u000a    (metaldehyde) from river waters. Funding has now been secured for a\u000a    demonstration of a photocatalytic pilot plant to refine the business case a\u000a    full-scale version of the technology in the next asset investment plan [C9].\u000a    Our work has helped to shape investment programmes, and assist utilities\u000a      in meeting future risks from new legislation related DBPs that are\u000a      currently unregulated such as haloacetic acids. Work for the Scottish\u000a      Government on use of alternative disinfectants led to a report published\u000a      by the water quality regulator for Scotland that has influenced policy on\u000a      water compliance for Scotland [C10].\u000a    The work on emerging DBPs was funded by a consortium of UK water\u000a      companies to understand the risks.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    New characterisation tools for natural organic matter (NOM) in drinking\u000a      water are now used as standard practice within water companies such as\u000a      Severn Trent Water, United Utilities and Yorkshire Water.

These sources\u000a      account for 30-40% of all the water used to produce drinking water in the\u000a      UK. The focus of the research has been on translating established\u000a      theoretical understanding to generate practical benefit that can be\u000a      applied in treatment works.\u000a    The initial work was the first to identify and publish seasonal changes\u000a      in the flux and character of NOM leaching into source waters [G1, P1].\u000a      Critically, the work identified that existing indicators, such as water\u000a      colour, were inadequate in defining NOM load for treatment purposes.\u000a      Further industrially funded projects led to Cranfield becoming the first\u000a      university outside North America to be funded by the American Water Works\u000a      Association Research Foundation (now called the Water Research Foundation)\u000a      [G2]. The project produce a novel diagnostic toolkit - still used by both\u000a      researchers and water company practitioners - to fully characterise both\u000a      NOM in the source water and the resultant coagulated NOM aggregates\u000a      (flocs) formed during treatment [P2]. This, for the first time, enabled\u000a      the link between source water changes and treatability to be understood\u000a      and managed.\u000a    Application of the toolkit led to discoveries which changed the\u000a      understanding of NOM removal in relation to treatability and optimisation\u000a      of coagulation. Traditional approaches involved empirical batch testing to\u000a      (re)establish the optimum dosing conditions. As a result of the work, it\u000a      is now possible for operators to monitor and change the effect of surface\u000a      charge on the coagulation process. Direct measurement of the particle\u000a      charge is used to optimise coagulation irrespective of the source water,\u000a      coagulant used, or pH level, without the need for empirical testing,\u000a      through a universal range of zeta potential values [P3].\u000a    In relation to treatability, we demonstrated that characterisation of the\u000a      organic matter within untreated raw water, by non-specific ion exchange\u000a      resins, can be used to identify both the likely coagulant demand and the\u000a      achievable residual dissolved organic matter concentration for optimised\u000a      dose conditions.\u000a    These key findings have been used for assessment and deployment of new\u000a      technologies and in adapting existing systems to cope with changing\u000a      environmental conditions. Work examined the potential of a novel ion\u000a      exchange process for NOM removal. We established the beneficial impacts\u000a      provided by ion exchange processes, such as reducing disinfection\u000a      by-product formation (DBP) and increasing floc strength, and thereby\u000a      reducing downstream processing costs [G3, P4]. This underpinned a decision\u000a      by Yorkshire Water to invest in the technology for full-scale application\u000a      at three treatment sites.\u000a    This was applied to other systems including algal laden reservoirs and\u000a      lowland water sources [G4]. Critically, and in conflict with conventional\u000a      thinking, the findings pertaining to peat based catchments were shown to\u000a      apply for all source waters. The work led to the discovery that sufficient\u000a      charge can be coated onto a bubble through surfactant and polymer\u000a      adsorption to obviate pre- coagulation of algae, a major limitation on\u000a      many operational sites, generating significant savings in energy and\u000a      operating costs (P5).\u000a    At the disinfection stage of water treatment, pioneering work in DBP\u000a      formation at Cranfield led to the first published work identifying the\u000a      risk associated with emerging DBPs such as haloacetic acids (HAA) and\u000a      nitrogen based DBPs in the UK [G5]. A critical discovery was the absence\u000a      of a link between treatability and DBP formation, meaning that targeted\u000a      removal of high DBP forming compounds in not possible [P6]. Recent work\u000a      funded by the Scottish Government identified that switching to\u000a      chloramination is insufficient to minimise the risk of non compliance and\u000a      highlighted the need for integrated solutions.\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Key Researchers\u000a          Post details and dates involved\u000a          Research\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Prof B Jefferson\u000a          Professor (2011-present)\u000a            Reader (2009-2011)\u000a            Senior Lecturer (2006-2009)\u000a          \u000a          Coagulation and flocculation,\u000a            advanced oxidation processes,\u000a            floatation processes, algae, zeta\u000a            potential\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr P Jarvis\u000a          Senior Lecturer (2012- Present)\u000a\u0009\u0009    Lecturer (2009-2012)\u000a            Academic Fellow (2007-2009)\u000a          \u000a          Coagulation and flocculation, ion\u000a            exchange processes, floc\u000a            characterisation\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr E Goslan\u000a          Senior Research Fellow (2013-present)\u000a            Research Fellow (2008-2013)\u000a            Research Officer (2003-2008)\u000a          Disinfection by products, Characterisation\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18038","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our research played an important role in safeguarding oil pan business\u000a      worth over &#163;20M for Cummins, and securing new business (for Eaton) with\u000a      Daewoo and Volkswagen Brazil after regained confidence in the component.\u000a      The oil pan business contributed around 25% to the $1 billion revenue of\u000a      Eaton automotive plastic business between 2010 and 2012 [C1].\u000a    Lightweight construction aims to preserve or even enhance a product's\u000a      functionality while the product`s overall weight decreases.

Tecnalia has also used the work to evaluate\u000a      impact of nanoproducts, which expanded its business and now has a new\u000a      nanosafety dedicated division [C4].\u000a    The US Consumer Products Safety Commission adopted our work in three\u000a      White Papers on the release of nanoparticles from consumer products during\u000a      use [C5]. This informs compliance with the regulatory framework for\u000a      consumer and environmental protection where industry must evaluate and, if\u000a      feasible, quantify, the risk of embedded nanoparticle released throughout\u000a      their lifecycle as an integral part of their innovation and design process\u000a      for nanotechnology enabled products and make this information available to\u000a      the relevant regulatory authorities and consumers.\u000a    The research also contributed to new methods for measurement and\u000a      lifecycle analysis of engineered nanoparticles for the European\u000a      Commission's Working Groups tasked with drafting of the European Strategic\u000a      Research Agenda for Nanosafety Research 2015-2020 [C6].

The work tailors the polymer\/nanoparticle to\u000a      achieve improved and balanced thermo-mechanical performance, and creates\u000a      organized assemblies by exploiting depletion interactions\/phase separation\u000a      of nanoclays and other nanoparticles. Use of thermoplastics and other\u000a      lightweight materials also aligns the UK's original equipment\u000a      manufacturers (OEMs)1 with the EU's vehicle end-of-life\u000a      directive in that by 2015, vehicles must be constructed of 95% recyclable\u000a      materials, with 85% recoverable through reuse or mechanical recycling and\u000a      10% through energy recovery or thermal recycling2.\u000a    The research stems from demarcation of molecular and structural features\u000a      that contribute to the mechanical properties of thermoplastic composites\u000a      [G1, G2]. This led to significant improvement in impact resistance and\u000a      performance of thermoplastic oil pans as desired by automotive industry.\u000a      The work initially looked into experimental and analytical techniques to\u000a      investigate failure mechanisms of short and continuous fibre-reinforced\u000a      composites as a function of loading and environment conditions [P1, P2].\u000a    A wet-engine oil sump (oil pan) is an important component in an engine.\u000a      The key concerns in the use of a thermoplastic oil pan are that it must\u000a      not only contain the oil but also have a structural role. As one of the\u000a      lowest parts in the engine, oil pans must also resist localised impact\u000a      loadings such as that imparted by roadway debris. A failure on the oil pan\u000a      base wall would lead to leakage and could result in a catastrophic engine\u000a      failure from oil starvation. Our motivation was to improve, predict and\u000a      assure the structural integrity of a wet-engine oil pan during its\u000a      functional life in the vehicle.\u000a    This work led to further research into application of nano- and\u000a      micro-sized fillers [G3]. Preliminary work indicated different reinforcing\u000a      effects due to interface structure and dynamics [P3]. We exploited the\u000a      idea of combining multi-scale fillers into a three-phase reinforced\u000a      composite, a very attractive solution for future lightweight structures\u000a      with balanced thermomechanical performance [G2, G4]. The research was also\u000a      underpinned by EC Framework 7 funding grants [G4, G5].\u000a    Our research showed that novel materials avoid negative effects of micro\u000a      filler, such as a reduction in material ductility [P5]. For example, we\u000a      developed improved nanophased energy absorbing sandwich structures using\u000a      polyurethane nanofoam exploiting the microcellural foam cells [P4, P6].\u000a      This established that (i) the incorporation of montmorillonite resulted in\u000a      a higher number of PU cells with smaller dimensions and higher anisotropy\u000a      index, and (ii) their nanophased sandwich structures resulted in improved\u000a      repeated impact performance with less structural damage.\u000a    A key insight in this work was the discovery that some of the pristine\u000a      nanoparticles used as fillers in nanoreinforced composites are released\u000a      from polymer matrices to the environment during functional life of the\u000a      products as original nanoparticles and in compound [P5]. These results\u000a      give new insights into nanoparticle behaviour and will advise on future\u000a      nanomaterial risk assessment, self-healing behaviour and depletion of\u000a      particles reinforcement and durability issues [G2, G5].\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Key researchers\u000a          Post details*\u000a          Dates involved\u000a          Research\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Prof. K Kayvantash\u000a          Professor\u000a          2008-2010\u000a          Durability and impact performance [G1,G2]\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr J Njuguna\u000a          Lecturer\u000a          2005-2013\u000a          Durability and impact performance,\u000a            Nanoparticles release and emission,\u000a            Thermo-mechanical performance\u000a            [G1,G2,G4,G5]\u000a    \u0009\u000a        \u000a          Dr H Abhyankar\u000a          Research Fellow\u000a          2012-2013\u000a          Nanoparticles release and emission,\u000a            Thermo-mechanical performance\u000a            [G2,G4,G5]\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr J Fan\u000a          Research Fellow\u000a          2011\u000a          Nanoparticles release and emission [G2,G5]\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr H Zhu\u000a          Lecture\u000a          2010-2013\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    * highest grade in period given\u000a    1King Review of low-carbon cars - Part I (2007) and Part II\u000a        (2008)\u000a    2European Union's 2015 EU End Of Life Vehicle Directive for\u000a        sustainability in the recycling of `end of life' cars\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18040","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aCranfield's work in hydrocarbon remediation has produced new practical analytical methods with\u000d\u000aapplications in industry.

Our research draws on Cranfield's\u000d\u000aanalytical and environmental modelling expertise with a substantive contribution to the practice of\u000d\u000asustainable remediation.\u000d\u000aWe have pioneered the detailed chemical examination of heavy oil residues by reference to risk\u000d\u000aconcepts, dramatically improving on the rudimentary analytical parameters used in risk\u000d\u000aassessment in the mid 1990's. Early work secured novel analytical insights on gas\u000d\u000achromatography to characterise complex weathered contaminated soil-oil matrices and allowed the\u000d\u000adevelopment of new analytical indices of biotransformation. This set the theoretical groundwork for\u000d\u000aan industrial research consortium addressing the risk-based bioremediation of weathered\u000d\u000ahydrocarbon waste in 2004 [G5]. This enabled us to construct innovative decision-support tools for\u000d\u000acontaminated sites such as the Remediation Decision Support Tool for stakeholders (BP, Shell,\u000d\u000aNational Grid) [G5] and service providers (Remedios Ltd) [P3,G5] and the fugacity1 based\u000d\u000amultimedia fate and transport tool [C1,2,G3,4,5].\u000d\u000aSpecifically, we addressed the partitioning of complex hydrocarbon mixtures within the soil-oil\u000d\u000amatrix of contaminated soils using authentic wastes and we characterised the fate and transport of\u000d\u000athe contaminants in question, a key requirement for estimating risks to human health and the\u000d\u000aenvironment [P1,3]. We also quantified the biotransformation half-lives in the residual oil phase\u000d\u000a[P2,4,6]. These are rarely, if ever, measured or even predicted [P2], and overly-conservative\u000d\u000aestimates had been resulting in over- stringent soil assessment criteria with considerable cost\u000d\u000aimplications for remediation - a waste of resource and a missed opportunity to recover land quality\u000d\u000a[C2]. Our research corrected this and has the potential to save between &#163;3.2 million and &#163;12.4\u000d\u000amillion per year in remediating derelict land for development in the UK [C1,3,4]. It further provided\u000d\u000aa `fit for purpose' assessment of the fate of hydrocarbon complex mixtures and risk-critical\u000d\u000acompounds in soils allowing realistic remediation objectives to be set [P2] supporting swifter, risk-\u000d\u000abased remediation.\u000d\u000aThe detailed evaluation of different hydrocarbon fractions has further helped the appraisal of\u000d\u000aresidual hydrocarbon levels that can be left safely at remediated sites without posing unacceptable\u000d\u000arisk [P2,5].

The work is of particular interest to jet engine\u000d\u000a      and industrial gas turbine manufacturers, who need coatings that can be\u000d\u000a      operated for longer and in more arduous conditions. Such developments\u000d\u000a      involve increasingly complex coating systems applied in multiple stages,\u000d\u000a      but are commercially sensitive [C6, 7].

The drivers have been\u000d\u000a      the need to improve efficiencies, reducing CO2 emissions and\u000d\u000a      fuel use; to allow the use of new fuel sources; and to improve reliability\u000d\u000a      by maintaining, or improving, component lives whilst using higher\u000d\u000a      operating temperatures and fuels with higher levels of contaminants.\u000d\u000a    This work has been aimed at improving the understanding of hot corrosion\u000d\u000a      (high and low temperature) and oxidation in these systems [G2, 3, 5; P1-3,\u000d\u000a      5, 6]. Cranfield has investigated the relationships between the damage\u000d\u000a      observed in different materials systems and the contaminants in the hot\u000d\u000a      gas stream (from different sources and qualities of fuel and air), gas\u000d\u000a      temperatures and pressures, component surface temperatures and deposits\u000d\u000a      formed on surfaces.\u000d\u000a    We optimised a methodology for assessing hot corrosion damage of\u000d\u000a      materials [G2, 3, 5; P2, 6]. This involves the use of deposit re-coat\u000d\u000a      testing combined with exposure in controlled-atmosphere furnaces. Samples\u000d\u000a      are measured before and after exposure to quantify the distribution of\u000d\u000a      damage in a statistically reliable method. One benefit of this method is\u000d\u000a      it allows the effects of specific aspects of the exposure to be\u000d\u000a      quantitatively linked to the materials damage found [P2, 6]. This enables\u000d\u000a      the sensitivity of materials to changes in exposure conditions to be\u000d\u000a      determined, and compared to the conditions\/damage seen in operating\u000d\u000a      systems.\u000d\u000a    A further investigation explored the ability of alternative metallic\u000d\u000a      coating compositions to resist particular degradation modes [G1, 4; P4].\u000d\u000a      This covered new developments for Al-Si diffusion coatings and MCrAlY\u000d\u000a      sprayed coatings. In addition, research on protective coatings examined a\u000d\u000a      new class of functionally graded metallic coatings that can resist\u000d\u000a      multiple degradation modes [G4].\u000d\u000a    A third strand investigated the performance of existing and developmental\u000d\u000a      metallic coatings\/alloys in industrial gas turbines, in future power\u000d\u000a      generation systems [G2, 5], [P1, 3, 5]. The need for new materials and\u000d\u000a      changes to more realistic system configurations has been identified. For\u000d\u000a      example, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems that use\u000d\u000a      biomass\/coal derived syngases (i.e., synthetic fuel gases), or hydrogen\u000d\u000a      enriched syngases (e.g., for EU H2-IGCC project), to fire gas turbines,\u000d\u000a      and gas turbines using oxy-fired natural gas (e.g., natural gas fired zero\u000d\u000a      emission power plant, GAS-ZEP).

These organisations (and in particular\u000a      Bombardier Transportation, who had collaborated in the work and\u000a      co-authored publication P1) informed the standardisation organisations of\u000a      the project results. As a result of these activities the output from this\u000a      work was incorporated into two European standards (S1 and S2 as listed in\u000a      section 5), both adopted across Europe in 2008:\u000a    \u000a      EN 15085 Railway applications &#8212; Welding of railway vehicles and\u000a        components (in particular Part 3, Annex H).\u000a      EN 15227 Crashworthiness requirements for railway vehicle bodies.\u000a    \u000a    One of the elements of the research output that facilitated the uptake of\u000a      the project results was the fact that the joint redesign solution provided\u000a      to prevent weld unzipping did not affect normal operations and\u000a      manufacturing processes to a significant degree and therefore the market\u000a      uptake was almost immediate. The main recommendations involved the use of\u000a      an alternative filler wire, Al-Mg, that proved to provide a microstructure\u000a      more resistant to tearing, instead of the Al-Si normally used by the\u000a      industry, and also a localised thickening of the extrusion cross section\u000a      at the joint to compensate for the strength loss arising from the heat\u000a      input from the welding process. The latter joint design feature was the\u000a      result of an optimisation process as excessive thickening of the cross\u000a      section resulted in promoting weld unzipping. These two standards have\u000a      been mandatory for railway vehicles since April 2008, and remain in force\u000a      now.\u000a    The former Head of Crash Safety at Bombardier has confirmed in a letter\u000a      to the University that the standards were developed on the basis of the\u000a      research carried out at Newcastle, making two key statements (S3):\u000a    \u000a      The R&amp;D work carried out at Newcastle University was of\u000a          excellent quality and its significance was recognised at an early\u000a          stage in the project by our Legislation and Standards Group which is\u000a          heavily involved in the development of Rail Standards in Europe. The\u000a          manner in which the work was carried out was in line with one of the\u000a          Bombardier key objectives of \"Flawless execution\".\u000a      Importantly these standards would not have been introduced without\u000a          the recommendations and underlying scientific work carried out at\u000a          Newcastle University.\u000a    \u000a    All European rail vehicle manufacturers have to comply with the standards\u000a      in order to market their products, and all worldwide manufacturers wishing\u000a      to sell aluminium rail vehicles in Europe have to ensure that the vehicles\u000a      comply with the standards. The European annual rolling stock market is\u000a      worth in excess of &#163;10 billion (S4), and most new build unpowered rolling\u000a      stock is aluminium rail vehicles.\u000a    The former Head of Crash Safety at Bombardier also notes (S3) that EN\u000a      15227 is now being embedded into a Technical Specification for\u000a      Interoperability. The European Interoperability Directive (2008\/57\/EC)\u000a      sets out a number of essential requirements to be met for interoperability\u000a      in the European rail system, which include safety, reliability and\u000a      availability, health, environmental protection and technical compatibility\u000a      along with others specific to certain sub-systems. The Directive also\u000a      requires the production of mandatory Technical Specifications for\u000a      Interoperability (TSIs) which define the technical standards required to\u000a      satisfy those essential requirements. TSIs in essence set out the expected\u000a      performance levels of the European railway system, and so standard will be\u000a      a benchmark for new product development in aluminium rail vehicles for the\u000a      European market.\u000a    The Head of R&amp;D of the Rail Safety and Standards Board has noted that\u000a      the research has (S5):\u000a    \"made a significant impact on the safety of aluminium rail vehicles in\u000a        Europe and beyond.\"\u000a    The motivation for the original research was to improve passenger safety,\u000a      which it is difficult to quantify. Thankfully, there has not been a crash\u000a      which replicated the conditions of the Ladbroke Grove incident. However,\u000a      we can note that since the introduction of the standards there have been\u000a      no reported instances of weld unzipping failures within the European rail\u000a      system.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Cullen Report into the Ladbroke Grove rail crash attributed the\u000a      catastrophic failures of the rail vehicles to \"weld unzipping\" (brittle\u000a      fast fracture).

Until the Ladbroke Grove accident weld unzipping\u000a      was associated with the pipeline industry (where it was encountered in\u000a      failures of pressurised longitudinally welded steel pipelines), and had\u000a      not been considered a significant safety concern within the railway\u000a      industry.\u000a    Mark Robinson, then at Sheffield University, applied, with partners, for\u000a      EC funding to look into this issue and with the ALJOIN project (G1 in the\u000a      list in section 3, co-ordinated by D'Appollonia in Italy) began to\u000a      research the crashworthiness of aluminium joints in 2002. This project was\u000a      initiated with Sheffield University as a partner, but when Robinson moved\u000a      to Newcastle in 2004 the project moved with him and Newcastle University\u000a      replaced Sheffield University as a partner. The work carried out at\u000a      Sheffield prior to the move was directed at testing existing rail vehicle\u000a      joint designs.\u000a    At Newcastle, Kotsikos (who was already a Research Associate at\u000a      Newcastle, and did not transfer from Sheffield) started to work with\u000a      Robinson on the ALJOIN project, and it was at Newcastle that the\u000a      significant engineering and materials science research was undertaken,\u000a      with Kotsikos the lead researcher. The research work carried out at\u000a      Newcastle involved a fundamental appraisal of the dynamic fracture\u000a      response of aluminium welds, and was the first time that a detailed\u000a      investigation of this type of material performance had been carried out in\u000a      the UK for the transportation industry. The research undertaken first\u000a      established the factors that promoted the weld unzipping behaviour in\u000a      extruded aluminium welded sections, most significantly the high loading\u000a      rate involved in a collision, the chemical composition of the\u000a      microstructure at the weld region, and the inherent undermatching problem\u000a      in heat treatable aluminium fusion welds (where the yield strength of the\u000a      weld is lower than that of the base material). Having identified the\u000a      underlying problems methods of improving the dynamic fracture response of\u000a      the Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding process (normally used by industry) were\u000a      researched, as well as examining alternative welding processes, such as\u000a      Friction Stir welding (FSW), Laser Beam welding (LBW) and adhesive bonding\u000a      (AB). The research demonstrated that none of the joining techniques\u000a      investigated would eliminate weld unzipping although small improvements\u000a      could be made through the use of an alternative welding consumable to the\u000a      one normally used by the industry for MIG welding.\u000a    The focus of the research then concentrated on the design of the joint\u000a      region by investigating geometries that would facilitate the dissipation\u000a      of the impact energy over the whole structure, rather than it being\u000a      confined to the joint region as a result of the localised weakening of the\u000a      material strength resulting from the fusion welding process. Finite\u000a      element analysis (FEA) modelling, supported by experimental fracture\u000a      mechanics, and validated through large scale impact tests, resulted in the\u000a      development of an optimised joint design that was able to eliminate weld\u000a      unzipping failures. The FEA models created reproduced remarkably closely\u000a      the failures that occurred at the Ladbroke Grove accident, giving\u000a      confidence in the modelling approach developed during the project and\u000a      demonstrating the significant improvement in crashworthiness of the same\u000a      vehicles if the type of joint designs developed in the project were\u000a      implemented.\u000a    Recognising the importance of the outcomes of the ALJOIN project, the\u000a      Railway Safety &amp; Standards Board commissioned ALJOIN plus (G2, with\u000a      Kotsikos as PI), to provide the necessary information to create a\u000a      benchmark for welded joints in aluminium rail vehicles against which\u000a      improvements in joint design could be measured.\u000a    The main research findings from ALJOIN and ALJOIN plus were reported in\u000a      publications P1 and P2 (listed in section 3), and the quality of the\u000a      science was recognised through P1 receiving two prizes: the \"2008 Safety\u000a      in Engineering Award\" from the IMechE and the \"2009 Sir Alfred Rosling\u000a      Bennett \/Charles S Lake Award\" from the Railway Division of the IMechE.\u000a    The key researchers at Newcastle for this research have been:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aKotsikos: Research Associate, 1997-2005; Principal Research\u000a        Associate 2005 to date.\u000a      \u000aRobinson: Professor of Rail Systems, 2004 to date.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21787","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of the research has been in three areas; (i) policy changes\u000d\u000a      implemented by government agencies, which in turn led to (ii) prevention\u000d\u000a      of harm to future patients, and (iii) financial implications for implant\u000d\u000a      manufacturers and healthcare providers. This impact was the result of\u000d\u000a      research carried out at Newcastle University (NU) and University Hospital\u000d\u000a      North Tees (NT) into (a) abnormally high levels of metal ions in patients\u000d\u000a      with the ASR hip, and (b) failure of all large-head MoM total hip\u000d\u000a      replacements. NU has led the engineering research, such as the analysis\u000d\u000a      and characterisation of wear and roughness of the implants, whilst NT led\u000d\u000a      the clinical research, including the radiographic analysis of implant\u000d\u000a      orientation and blood ion levels.\u000d\u000a    The first change in policy relates to the use of ASR hip implants, in\u000d\u000a      both the resurfacing and total hip replacement form. Although the\u000d\u000a      withdrawal of the ASR was voluntary, international healthcare bodies\u000d\u000a      changed their policy in the light of the growing body of evidence of the\u000d\u000a      poor performance of the ASR, for example calling for patients to be\u000d\u000a      monitored for the life of the implant (S1). The second change in worldwide\u000d\u000a      policy concerned the use of large-head metal-on-metal (MoM) implants, of\u000d\u000a      which approximately a million have been implanted worldwide. Regulatory\u000d\u000a      bodies, including the FDA began to issue new policies and guidance and in\u000d\u000a      early 2012 guidance was issued by the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare\u000d\u000a      products Regulatory Agency) (S2), the Danish Orthopaedic Associations (S3)\u000d\u000a      and Health Canada (S4) recommending against the use of large-head MoM\u000d\u000a      implants until further evidence was available.\u000d\u000a    This worldwide impact was a consequence of the increase in understanding\u000d\u000a      of the vulnerabilities of the ASR and all large head MoM. The importance\u000d\u000a      of the work has been recognised in several ways. Both P1 and P3 are\u000d\u000a      included within the FDA's Executive Summary published in June 2012 (S5).\u000d\u000a      An article by authors from the National Joint Registry for England and\u000d\u000a      Wales and the MHRA (S6) stated that \"Data critical of the performance\u000d\u000a      of the ASR were presented at numerous scientific meetings in 2008 and\u000d\u000a      onward to the time of this writing, particularly at meetings of the\u000d\u000a      British Hip Society (BHS) and the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA).\u000d\u000a      This factor, rather than the MHRA alert in July 2010, almost certainly\u000d\u000a      led to the subsequent drop in sales of that implant\". Newcastle\u000d\u000a      University researchers starting presenting their data on the performance\u000d\u000a      of the ASR at meetings in 2008, with one presented at the British Hip\u000d\u000a      Society meeting in February 2008, and two at the BOA Annual Congress in\u000d\u000a      Liverpool in September 2008. The advisory document produced by the BOA in\u000d\u000a      March 2011 refers to the research performed at NT (S7). In recognition of\u000d\u000a      his expert status, Joyce spoke at the House of Commons Select Committee in\u000d\u000a      May 2012, a session dedicated to discussing medical implant regulation and\u000d\u000a      several recommendations put forward by Joyce were accepted in the\u000d\u000a      Committee's final report (S8). For example, recommendation 16: \"The\u000d\u000a      Government should ensure that raw data from the National Joint Registry\u000d\u000a      (NJR) is published where possible. In addition, explanted joints should be\u000d\u000a      analysed, and subsequent data generated should be reported to the NJR and\u000d\u000a      published.\"\u000d\u000a    The withdrawal of both the ASR and large-head metal-on-metal hips from\u000d\u000a      the market reduces the harm and prevents risk of injury to future patients\u000d\u000a      that may have been eligible for these implants. On the basis that 1\u000d\u000a      million hips per annum are implanted (S9) and that, in the US, 35% were\u000d\u000a      metal-on-metal (S10) then 350,000 potential patients per year have been\u000d\u000a      protected from the adverse effects of metal-on-metal hips. The financial\u000d\u000a      impact for health providers is also significant. In the UK the cost of\u000d\u000a      replacing a failed artificial joint with a new implant in a `revision'\u000d\u000a      operation can be up to &#163;25,000 per patient. With the latest Australian\u000d\u000a      data showing a 44% revision rate for the ASR hip, and almost 100,000\u000d\u000a      implanted worldwide, the costs of revision are projected to exceed &#163;1\u000d\u000a      billion. Redress is also being sought in courts in a number of countries.\u000d\u000a      In the first ASR case to come to trial in the USA, the litigant was\u000d\u000a      awarded $8.3 million. There are currently 11,000 ASR litigants in the US\u000d\u000a      alone, with class actions due to commence in that country in late 2013.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The high failure rate of metal-on-metal hip implants led to worldwide\u000d\u000a      concern. Collaborative research between Newcastle University and\u000d\u000a      University Hospital of North Tees identified design features that are\u000d\u000a      considered to have contributed to the failure. The research helped to\u000d\u000a      inform policy makers both nationally, such as the Medicines and Healthcare\u000d\u000a      products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and internationally, such as the US\u000d\u000a      Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

However,\u000d\u000a      concerns started to be raised from 2006 onwards about their performance.\u000d\u000a    Research at Newcastle has covered two main areas:\u000d\u000a    (i) Identifying the reasons for failure of a specific MoM hip\u000d\u000a      resurfacing (the DePuy Articular Surface Replacement, ASR).\u000d\u000a    (ii) Investigation of generic design features that affected\u000d\u000a      several different types of large-diameter head MoM total hip replacements.\u000d\u000a    Initial exploratory research in 2007 by Joyce at Newcastle University in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Langton and Nargol at the University Hospital of North\u000d\u000a      Tees, investigated possible causes of abnormal wear in the ASR hip.\u000d\u000a      Radiography was used to determine the orientation of the cup component of\u000d\u000a      the implant within the patient, and blood samples were taken to determine\u000d\u000a      levels of cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) metal ions. This initial work (P1,\u000d\u000a      as listed in section 3) found that metal ion concentration was associated\u000d\u000a      with orientation of the ASR cup, and was the first to demonstrate that the\u000d\u000a      ASR cup was particularly vulnerable to sub-optimal placement. Publication\u000d\u000a      of this and subsequent research was in the Journal of Bone and Joint\u000d\u000a      Surgery, which was selected as it is widely read by the orthopaedic\u000d\u000a      surgeons who decide which implants to use in their patients. Awarded as a\u000d\u000a      consequence of P1, grant G1 allowed this collaborative work to continue,\u000d\u000a      increasing the number of hips studied and providing a comparison to the\u000d\u000a      Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) and Conserve Plus (C+); two similar,\u000d\u000a      well-established, implants. Two grants (G2 and G3) supported further work\u000d\u000a      (P2-P4, published between 2008 and 2011) that revealed two aspects:\u000d\u000a      firstly, that ASR hips had a significantly higher Co concentration than\u000d\u000a      BHR hips, and secondly that the ASR cup was sensitive to sub-optimal\u000d\u000a      positioning due to the shallow nature of the cup (P2). In 2010, 418 ASR\u000d\u000a      and 155 BHR patients were investigated (P3) for adverse reaction to metal\u000d\u000a      debris. This paper found that all patients with such an adverse reaction\u000d\u000a      had ASR hips, whereas no adverse reaction was seen in BHR patients. The\u000d\u000a      largest study of hip resurfacings at the time of publication (P4) was\u000d\u000a      carried out in 2011, analysing over 4200 ASR, BHR and C+ hips. ASR\u000d\u000a      patients had a significantly higher risk of revision (where the implant\u000d\u000a      requires replacement) than those with BHR or C+, as a consequence of an\u000d\u000a      adverse reaction to metal debris. The ASR was confirmed as the most\u000d\u000a      vulnerable to positioning of the cup, a critical factor since consistency\u000d\u000a      of placement during surgery cannot currently be guaranteed.\u000d\u000a    The second area of research was into failure of large-head MoM total hip\u000d\u000a      replacements. Starting in 2009, Joyce, Lord, Langton and Nargol quantified\u000d\u000a      wear in failed total hip replacements (P5) using a co-ordinate measuring\u000d\u000a      machine funded by G1. It was found that material was lost from both the\u000d\u000a      articulating surfaces and from the junction of the head and neck of the\u000d\u000a      implant. Further research led to the first paper in the field (P6) to\u000d\u000a      quantify loss from this junction, which was proposed to be a result of two\u000d\u000a      design elements common to most large-head (&#8805;36mm) MoM total hip\u000d\u000a      replacements: the reduction in the size of the taper connection and the\u000d\u000a      increase in diameter of the femoral head.\u000d\u000a    The key researchers at Newcastle University have been:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aJoyce: Lecturer in Bioengineering 2007-2009; Senior Lecturer in\u000d\u000a        Bioengineering 2009-2010; Reader in Biotribology 2010-12; Professor of\u000d\u000a        Orthopaedic Engineering, 2012 to date.\u000d\u000a      \u000aLangton: Research Fellow, 2008-2010 (and also research\u000d\u000a        registrar at the University Hospital of North Tees from 2007-2008).\u000d\u000a      \u000aLord: PhD Student, 2008-2011.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21789","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The growth in interest in composite pipeline repairs led Shell\u000a      International, who were a partner in the \"Composites Offshore\" programme,\u000a      to approach the standards bodies in order to establish international\u000a      standards which would ensure the quality of pipeline repairs. Their\u000a      knowledge of the original work led them to approach Gibson and Kotsikos to\u000a      support drafting of the standards, based on P3.\u000a    This led to the drafting of two entirely new standards, ISO\/TS 24817 -\u000a      Composite repairs for pipework, published in 2006 and revised in 2011 (S1\u000a      in section 5) and more recently ASME PCC-2, Repair of pressure vessels and\u000a      piping, published in 2008 and revised in 2011 (S2), with the ASME standard\u000a      based on the ISO standard. These are now mandatory standards for any\u000a      organisation undertaking composite pipeline repair. The introduction of\u000a      engineered composite pipeline repairs underpinned by these standards\u000a      marked a clear step forward in safety enhancement in the offshore industry\u000a      whilst simultaneously minimising disruption and therefore reducing costs.\u000a      Their use in off-shore installations is especially widespread because they\u000a      are a cold temperature repair solution. The technology has played an\u000a      essential part in maintaining the productivity of ageing offshore plant\u000a      around the world and in particular in the North Sea.\u000a    4.1 Impact on Standards\u000a      Composite pipeline repairs are used by a wide variety of sectors including\u000a      aerospace, automotive and the offshore industry mainly because of their\u000a      versatility and cold application. Until the development of the new\u000a      international standards based on Newcastle's research in this area, uptake\u000a      of composite repairs was limited due to the inconsistent application of\u000a      repairs and consequent variation in the failure rates of the repairs.\u000a    The standards were developed to cover all aspects of installation\u000a      including the training and validation of the repair staff. These two\u000a      standards have enormously improved the consistency of repair works in this\u000a      area and given a significant stimulus to their uptake in the offshore\u000a      industry. In the development of the ISO standard (which covers the\u000a      material qualification, design, installation and inspection of composite\u000a      repairs) several new test methods and analysis routines were developed.\u000a      These test methods were specifically concerned with assessing and\u000a      quantifying the adhesion characteristics of composite repairs to metallic\u000a      pipes. The Chairman of the ISO committee supports the contribution made by\u000a      Newcastle University to the ISO\/TS 24817 standard [S3]:\u000a    \"During the development and writing of the ISO standard the work\u000a        performed by Newcastle University formed the basis for the test protocol\u000a        and the analysis routine used to convert the qualification test data\u000a        into an engineering parameter which is used in the design of the\u000a        composite repair. Without doubt without the supporting work of Newcastle\u000a        University the current ISO standard, ISO\/TS 24817, would not be such a\u000a        robust standard in terms of the engineering rigor of the test and\u000a        analysis routines of the measured qualification test data.\"\u000a    4.2 Impact on Pipeline Industry\u000a      Several successful companies (or parts of companies) specialising in\u000a      composite repair technology have been created offering pipeline\u000a      rehabilitation services around the world (e.g. Prokem Pipeline Products,\u000a      IMG Composites, Walker Technical, ENECON and Clock Spring). The size of\u000a      the worldwide market for pipeline repairs is estimated to be &#163;250-350M\u000a      p.a., with at least 10% growth expected in the European market next year [S4].\u000a      The development of the international standards, underpinned by the\u000a      original research at Newcastle, has given the technical confidence to\u000a      support the growth of this industry sector. The work at Newcastle has\u000a      played a key role in transforming the working practices of the pipe repair\u000a      and maintenance industry.\u000a    Comments in an article entitled `Composite pipe repairs gain acceptance'\u000a      by the Chief Executive at Belzona, an industrial company specialising in\u000a      the repair and maintenance of buildings, structures, machinery and\u000a      equipment identified the following as the characteristics which have led\u000a      to the wide adoption of composite pipe repairs [S5]:\u000a    \"Composite repairs have gained greater acceptance among asset owners\u000a        and equipment operators because they provide an engineered, durable and\u000a        affordable solution and they comply with international engineering\u000a        standards.\"\u000a    Concluding his article he goes on to state:\u000a    \"Composite repairs are indeed the right solution for extending the\u000a        lifetime of equipment in an efficient and reliable manner.\"\u000a    The Technical Director of Walker Technical, a UK company involved in\u000a      composite technology for the oil and gas, petrochemical, refinery and\u000a      power industries supports the increasing use of composite repairs and in\u000a      particular in off-shore installations [S3]:\u000a    \"Composite repairs over the last few years have become a\u000a        common repair solution for damaged or corroded pipework in Oil and Gas\u000a        installations. Their use, particularly in off-shore installations, has\u000a        become widespread due to the fact that they are a cold repair solution.\u000a        Hot repair solutions e.g. welding are considered a safety risk due to\u000a        the presence of both heat and ignition sources.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Following the North Sea Piper Alpha oil rig accident in 1988 and\u000a      subsequent Cullen inquiry, new and safer maintenance procedures were\u000a      introduced. One of the most significant changes was the restriction in the\u000a      use of welding repairs (hot work) in the maintenance of plant and pipework\u000a      due to the risk of fire and explosion. Research at Newcastle provided a\u000a      novel engineering model that formed the basis for implementation of a new\u000a      repair technology. This used fibre reinforced polymer wraps to restore the\u000a      integrity of pipes without `hot work' or any interruption of production,\u000a      thus minimising operational costs and increasing worker safety. This new\u000a      technology has now become industry standard with new ISO and ASME\u000a      standards for pipeline repair established as mandatory standards in 2006\u000a      and 2008 respectively (ISO\/TS 24817 &#8212; Composite repairs for pipework; and\u000a      ASME PCC-2, Repair of pressure vessels and piping).

The research was a Managed\u000a      Programme of the Marine Technology Directorate (MTD) of the Science and\u000a      Engineering Research Council (SERC), and the overall research programme\u000a      and its outcomes were later summarised as publication P1 (as listed in\u000a      section 3). The overall technical work programme was directed by Gibson at\u000a      Newcastle University. Professor Gibson led a strong team of senior\u000a      academics and researchers at Newcastle, Manchester, Salford, Nottingham\u000a      and Liverpool Universities, UMIST, and Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College,\u000a      London.\u000a    As part of phase IV (1998-2001) of the \"Composites Offshore\" programme\u000a      Newcastle University was funded to carry out research into the durability\u000a      and reliability of composite pipes in offshore applications (projects\u000a      CP404: Failure Envelopes for Composite Tubulars in Liquid Environments at\u000a      High Temperatures; and CP411: Fatigue of Offshore Components in Liquid\u000a      Environments). This research led to publications P2 and P3. P3 established\u000a      the fundamental principles of pipeline repair using composite wrapping\u000a      technology, with the research carried out by Dodds and supervised by\u000a      Gibson, with industrial collaboration from Vosper Thorneycroft. The\u000a      primary motivation of the pipeline repair research was to find a way of\u000a      rehabilitating pipes without using the traditional method of welding, as\u000a      this had been found to bring a significant risk of fire and explosion when\u000a      applied in the oil industry. In order to weld safely, in accordance with\u000a      the safer maintenance procedures introduced after the Cullen enquiry into\u000a      Piper Alpha oil rig incident, significant downtime within a facility was\u000a      required which meant that even relatively straightforward repairs were\u000a      costly.\u000a    The research proved the concept of a properly engineered composite\u000a      overwrap repair, applied in-situ and without hot work, which could be used\u000a      to restore the pressure capacity of a corroded or damaged pipe and which\u000a      had added corrosion protection benefits. It involved investigation of the\u000a      adhesion parameters and fracture mechanics aspects of composite repairs on\u000a      pressurised steel substrates. Good adhesion between the composite repair\u000a      and the corroded substrate was found to be essential for effective load\u000a      transfer between the pipe and the composite overwrap, as well for\u000a      prevention of ingress of water into the repair-substrate interface. The\u000a      work provided quantitative information on the failure mechanisms involved\u000a      at the interface between the metal substrate and the composite. The\u000a      performance of various thermosetting polymer resins was studied, and\u000a      coupled with optimisation of the metal substrate surface preparation\u000a      parameters in order to achieve an optimum bond. The best fibre\u000a      reinforcement architecture for mechanical performance and pressure rating\u000a      was also identified. Publication P3 was the first in-depth systematic\u000a      evaluation of how to apply composite wrapping in order to ensure high\u000a      quality performance.\u000a    The researchers involved in the work were:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aGibson: Professor of Composite Materials, 1988 to date.\u000a      \u000aDodds: Research Associate, 1998-2001; Senior Research Associate\u000a        2003-2007.\u000a      \u000aKotsikos: Research Associate, 1997-2005; Principal Research\u000a        Associate 2005 to date.\u000a    \u000a    Gibson has led the work throughout.

Two specific areas of research which have been\u000d\u000a      actively pursued since 1987\u000d\u000a      are gear geometry measurement and calibration, and gear performance\u000d\u000a      testing for improved\u000d\u000a      understanding of micro-pitting and gear surface engineering.\u000d\u000a    2.1 Gear Geometry Measurement and Calibration\u000d\u000a    The Design Unit operates the UK National Gear Metrology Laboratory (NGML)\u000d\u000a      which, since 1987,\u000d\u000a      has been part of the UK National Measurement System (NMS) and is a\u000d\u000a      Designated Institute (DI)\u000d\u000a      for gear measurement. The NGML is part funded by the NMS to support and\u000d\u000a      maintain the UKs\u000d\u000a      national gear standards.\u000d\u000a    In 1993 Frazer surveyed UK industrial measurement capability and found\u000d\u000a      that poor measurement\u000d\u000a      practice caused significant errors in many organisations. The lack of\u000d\u000a      reliable reference calibration\u000d\u000a      data for this survey prompted the NGML to extend the survey to include\u000d\u000a      other national laboratories\u000d\u000a      (funded by G1 as listed in section 3). The results from this suggested\u000d\u000a      that there were also\u000d\u000a      significant differences between National Laboratories. The first\u000d\u000a      international comparison of gear\u000d\u000a      measurement capability was organised by Frazer at the NGML in 1998-1999\u000d\u000a      (G2) with the results\u000d\u000a      published in 2004 (publication P1 as listed in section 3). The work\u000d\u000a      evaluated profile, helix and\u000d\u000a      pitch errors and showed that excessive differences with gear profile\u000d\u000a      measurement were linked to\u000d\u000a      different data sampling strategies. When these issues were corrected, the\u000d\u000a      differences in\u000d\u000a      measurements became acceptable.\u000d\u000a    2.2 Micro-pitting and Gear Surface Engineering\u000d\u000a    The extensive gear performance and characterisation test facilities at\u000d\u000a      Design Unit are used to\u000d\u000a      define reliable permissible stresses and to understand gear failure modes.\u000d\u000a      Physical testing of\u000d\u000a      gears allows the effects of material, processing, heat treatment, design,\u000d\u000a      lubrication and running\u000d\u000a      conditions on gear performance to be understood.

The projects\u000a      involved more than 25 industrial partners, ensuring fast commercial\u000a      exploitation and\u000a      dissemination of the research results. Major supermarkets in the UK such\u000a      as Marks and\u000a      Spencer, Sainsbury's and Tesco have quickly responded to the environmental\u000a      and economic\u000a      benefits of the technologies. Subsequently, they have embedded the\u000a      installation of the CHP and\u000a      tri-generation with CO2 refrigeration system into their\u000a      business strategies.\u000a    The industrial partner, GEA Searle, has introduced and supplied the CO2\u000a      refrigeration system to\u000a      Marks and Spencer. Marks and Spencer's Plan A (2010-2015) commits it to\u000a      addressing its\u000a      environmental impacts. One of its key objectives is to reduce carbon\u000a      emissions from\u000a      refrigeration: it aims to reduce carbon emissions from store refrigeration\u000a      by 50% by 2015; to use\u000a      the CO2 refrigeration systems in all new store refrigeration\u000a      installations from 2010; and to\u000a      replace HCFCs by 2014 and HFCs by 2030 (Objective 10.15 Store\u000a      Refrigeration, Marks and\u000a      Spencer Plan A). In its 2013 business review report, Marks and Spencer\u000a      states that compared\u000a      to a baseline of 129,000 tonnes in 2006\/7, emissions were down by 20% in\u000a      2010\/11, by 46% in\u000a      2011\/12, and by 60% in 2013 (at 51,000 tonnes). The total financial saving\u000a      in CO2 emissions\u000a      from 2010 to 2013 only is equivalent to over &#163;4 million. Allowing for\u000a      increases in store footage,\u000a      emissions were down by 31% in 2010\/11 and 54% at 4.3tCO2e\/1000\u000a      sq ft in 2011\/12 from\u000a      9.4tCO2e\/1000 sq ft in 2006\/7. The number of stores using the\u000a      CO2 refrigeration systems was\u000a      increased from 28 in 2011 to 49 in 2012. [A-1, A-2, A-3]\u000a    Similarly, the collaborative research projects with Bond Retail Services\u000a      Ltd and Hauser have led\u000a      to the installation of CO2 refrigerated cabinets in\u000a      Sainsbury's. Sainsbury's aims to switch to the\u000a      CO2 refrigeration system in 250 stores by 2014. 160 stores (as\u000a      of 2013) have the new CO2\u000a      refrigeration system and all new stores are fitted with the CO2\u000a      refrigeration system as standard.\u000a      Sainsbury's expects that this could `save over 70,000 tonnes of CO2\u000a      compared to [its] current\u000a      refrigerated trailer fleet'. [B-1] This is equivalent to over a &#163;3.6\u000a      million saving. Reflecting this\u000a      commitment, in 2012 Sainsbury's provided `hands-on' training for around\u000a      200 refrigeration\u000a      service engineers so that they became familiar with the CO2\u000a      refrigeration system. [B-2]\u000a    Tesco, in collaboration with the Carbon Trust Standard and Brunel,\u000a      developed the CHP and tri-\u000a      generation with CO2 refrigeration system with the aim of saving\u000a      over 10,000 tonnes of carbon\u000a      footprint. [C] It installed the CHP and tri-generation with CO2\u000a      refrigeration system in its first\u000a      `environmental store' in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, which opened in Jan\u000a      2009. Tesco states\u000a      that `the 52,000 sq ft store has a carbon footprint 70% smaller than\u000a      stores built in 2006'. In\u000a      addition to the sustainable construction features of the store, Tesco\u000a      acknowledges that the CHP\u000a      plant alone has reduced the carbon footrpint of the store by a third and\u000a      the CO2 refrigeration\u000a      system by a fifth. [D-1] This store was followed by the Ramsey store in\u000a      Cambridgeshire, the\u000a      world's first zero carbon supermarket, which also exploited the same CHP\u000a      and tri-generation\u000a      with CO2 refrigeration technologies. [D-2]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Refrigeration alone accounts for 30-60% of the total energy consumption\u000a      of retail food stores and\u000a      15-20% of carbon footprint of retail food chains in the UK. Since 2001,\u000a      Prof Tassou and his\u000a      research team at Brunel have been conducting research on combined heat and\u000a      power (CHP), tri-\u000a      generation (simultaneous production of electrical power, heat and\u000a      refrigeration) and CO2\u000a      refrigeration systems for food retail applications. With their 25\u000a      industrial partners, these\u000a      technologies were quickly exploited by large retail food stores such as\u000a      Marks and Spencer,\u000a      Sainsbury's and Tesco. Since 2010, Marks and Spencer has reduced its\u000a      carbon emissions from\u000a      refrigeration and air conditioning by 60% from the 2006\/7 baseline, saving\u000a      over &#163;4 million. 160\u000a      Sainsbury's stores have the new CO2 refrigeration system as of\u000a      2013 and they plan to have it\u000a      installed in all 250 stores by 2014, saving over 70,000 tonnes of carbon\u000a      footprint, equivalent to a\u000a      financial saving of &#163;3.6 million. They also provided training for the CO2\u000a      refrigeration system to 200\u000a      refrigeration service engineers in 2012. Tesco claims that using the CHP\u000a      and the CO2 refrigeration\u000a      system in its first `environmental store' has reduced 70% of its overall\u000a      carbon footprint since its\u000a      opening in 2009, of which a third comes from the CHP plant and a fifth\u000a      from the new refrigeration\u000a      system.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    BRUNEL UNIVERSITY (H0113)\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Brunel University","InstitutionName":"Brunel University","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10000961}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    References:\u000a    \u000aTassou, SA, Chaer, I, Sugiartha, N, Ge, Y-T, Marriott, D.

This research set\u000d      out to dramatically increase efficiency and range (Elmarakbi et al, 2013).\u000d      Early experimental work undertaken by the team used computer simulation\u000d      and a laboratory rig (Ren at al, 2010); this work has shown that by using\u000d      a CAN controller and software it is possible to use a multi speed gearbox\u000d      to dramatically increase efficiency and so range. In particular the work\u000d      developed an electric vehicle model and predicted its energy consumption\u000d      with a variable and fixed ratio gearbox over a standard driving cycle in\u000d      order to understand whether this could offer significant efficiency gains.\u000d      The conclusion of this research was that it is possible to improve overall\u000d      energy consumption levels with a variable ratio gearbox depending on the\u000d      driving cycle used.\u000d    Ren's PhD work (2007 - 2010) included the analysis and modelling a twin\u000d      epicyclic gearbox; the analysis and modelling of the twin epicyclic system\u000d      in a vehicle and a comparison of the results with a single epicyclic\u000d      system; and the analysis and modelling of electric vehicles with and\u000d      without a transmission system of varying levels of complexity and showed\u000d      that there are worthwhile performance benefits from using improved\u000d      transmission designs for low carbon vehicles. Simulation results of two\u000d      electric vehicle examples confirm that energy consumption benefits are\u000d      indeed achievable; of between 7 and 14% depending on the driving cycle.\u000d    The approach was extended to model (using a computer and a full scale\u000d      prototype rig) the application of an electric motor to the existing\u000d      transmission of an electric vehicle. This model was then used to study the\u000d      possible efficiencies in each gear. From this work a prototype for a novel\u000d      gearbox control system was produced. The approach (Ren et al, 2010) has\u000d      created a radically altered perception of how gearboxes should be used\u000d      within electric vehicles and is very different from the approach being\u000d      pursued by other researchers and manufacturers. Initial modelling of a\u000d      traction motor coupled to the 4 speed `automatic manual' transmission has\u000d      shown significant benefits can be achieved leading to a reduction in the\u000d      traction motor size of up to 25% in some configurations, a reduction in\u000d      the battery pack size and weight of up to 10% and a reduction of the\u000d      systems operating voltage to 100v which reduces the cost of the battery\u000d      management system \/ control electronics.\u000d    The related EcO2Trans project was a collaborative project with Shanghai's\u000d      Shen Li High Technology and Avid vehicles which used simulation to design\u000d      a power management system for fuel cell and battery powered buses (Hu et\u000d      al, 2010). One North East has invested &#163;314,000 to sponsor the ECO2Trans\u000d      project, which is converting two electric Gulliver U500EUK buses into\u000d      hydrogen vehicles using a fuel cell, battery and capacitor combination.\u000d      The University of Sunderland's Institute of Automotive and Manufacturing\u000d      Advanced Practice (AMAP) has joined forces with experts from Shanghai's\u000d      Shen Li High Technology and Cramlington-based AVID Vehicles to carry out\u000d      the work. Alongside this the team have been exploring the use of hydrogen\u000d      as an alternative fuel source for vehicles, in collaboration with Nissan\u000d      and with Sunderland City Council.\u000d    Staff involved in the research: Adrian Morris (Head of AMAP,\u000d      Institute for Automotive and Manufacturing Advanced Practice, 1994 &#8212;\u000d      present), Dr. Qinglian Ren (PhD student, 2007 - 2010, graduated and now\u000d      employed at Changan UK), Prof. Dave Crolla (Visiting Professor at\u000d      University of Sunderland; 2004 until he sadly passed away in 2011);\u000d      Professor Ahmed Elmarakbi (Professor, 2007 &#8212; present), Dr David Baglee\u000d      (Senior Lecturer, 2000 &#8212; present), Dr Mike Knowles (Senior Lecturer, 2007\u000d      &#8212; present), Dirk Kok (Research Assistant, 2003 &#8212; present).\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28151","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context\u000d\u000a    Fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions are integral to modern\u000d\u000a      economies and societies. Climate policy is a relatively new area of\u000d\u000a      governance. Historically, international aviation has been overlooked at\u000d\u000a      the national level and widely regarded as a trivial source of greenhouse\u000d\u000a      gas emissions. For instance, the UK Aviation White Paper (2003) paid\u000d\u000a      little attention to emissions, and aviation was excluded from the\u000d\u000a      emissions reduction targets of international climate change agreements\u000d\u000a      such as the UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol.\u000d\u000a    Summary of pathway to impact\u000d\u000a    The impact is founded on Tyndall Centre research funded by\u000d\u000a      EPSRC\/NERC\/ESRC, from 2002 to 2010: researchers developed comprehensive\u000d\u000a      approaches to decarbonisation, from national and international energy\u000d\u000a      systems and policy frameworks through to personal energy behaviour.\u000d\u000a    Tyndall-Manchester's research had demonstrable impact in four key\u000d\u000a        policy areas:\u000d\u000a    1) Inclusion of aviation in the UK Climate Change Act &amp; Climate\u000d\u000a        Change (Scotland) Act.\u000d\u000a      The research conducted within Tyndall Manchester has significantly\u000d\u000a      contributed to climate policies in the UK and EU through formal evidence\u000d\u000a      presented by its researchers to policymakers and statutory public bodies,\u000d\u000a      including the Environmental Audit Committee [A] and HM Treasury aviation\u000d\u000a      working group. Evidence from the research was also presented by invitation\u000d\u000a      to the Scottish Parliament during their consultation on the Climate Change\u000d\u000a      (Scotland) Bill [B]. These representations were highly influential in\u000d\u000a      securing the inclusion of aviation emissions in the UK Climate Change\u000d\u000a      Act's 2050 emissions reduction target as evidenced by statements from\u000d\u000a      David Milliband MP, former Secretary of State for Environment, Food and\u000d\u000a      Rural Affairs (2006-7), and author of Climate Change Bill [D]. Additional\u000d\u000a      corroboration is provided by statements from Tim Yeo MP [E], Chair of\u000d\u000a      House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, Caroline\u000d\u000a      Lucas MP, Member of the Environmental Audit Committee and former Member of\u000d\u000a      the European Parliament and Colin Challen, former Member of Parliament and\u000d\u000a      Member of House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee. Tyndall\u000d\u000a      researchers are on-going participants in the Committee on Climate Change\u000d\u000a      and the Civil Aviation Authority's aviation stakeholder consultations -\u000d\u000a      with the Committee on Climate Change subsequently recommending inclusion\u000d\u000a      of aviation within the UK's legally binding emission reduction target for\u000d\u000a      2050 [F].\u000d\u000a    2) Inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS\u000d\u000a      Tyndall-Manchester research contributed to the inclusion of aviation in\u000d\u000a      the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, the EU's flagship mechanism for curbing\u000d\u000a      the continent's emissions [G]. Further corroboration is provided by\u000d\u000a      statements from Mike Childs, Head of Policy, Research and Science at\u000d\u000a      Friends of the Earth and Caroline Lucas, MP. Debate regarding the\u000d\u000a      inclusion of aviation within the EU's emissions trading system and in the\u000d\u000a      UK's own emission budgets intensified following the publication of early\u000d\u000a      Tyndall-Manchester research [1-5 above]. Tyndall-Manchester researchers\u000d\u000a      were active participants in this debate, with the public record containing\u000d\u000a      numerous instances of evidence provided by Tyndall-Manchester from 2005\u000d\u000a      onwards [H]. Whereas the decision on including aviation in the UK's\u000d\u000a      climate change budgets has yet to be taken, since Jan 2012 all\u000d\u000a      commercial airlines operating solely within the EU have to buy and\u000d\u000a      surrender emissions permits. Furthermore, the EU policy surprised many in\u000d\u000a      intending to incorporate more than the EU 50% `fair share' of emissions.\u000d\u000a    3) Cancellation \/ deferment of airport expansion at Heathrow and\u000d\u000a        Stansted\u000d\u000a      Tyndall-Manchester's aviation research has generated considerable impact\u000d\u000a      indirectly through raising the public profile of the potential damage\u000d\u000a      aviation does to the environment, and the importance of passenger or\u000d\u000a      airport growth as a facilitator of such damage. This profile raising has\u000d\u000a      in large part been through the research findings being taken up by\u000d\u000a      high-profile campaigning groups in lobbying government to halt UK airport\u000d\u000a      expansion on the basis of climate change concerns [G, I]. Groups including\u000d\u000a      Friends of the Earth (corroborating statement available [L]), WWF, Plane\u000d\u000a      Stupid and Climate Camp used Tyndall-Manchester aviation work as the\u000d\u000a      scientific underpinning of a number of their campaign tactics [C], for\u000d\u000a      which there is also photographic evidence. For instance, as the BAA\u000d\u000a      chairman and chief executive were preparing to give evidence on airport\u000d\u000a      problems, protesters chanted \"no third runway at Heathrow\" and handed out\u000d\u000a      copies of a Tyndall report [2, above] to MPs and members of the public.\u000d\u000a      Plane Stupid also used the research in their campaign against airport\u000d\u000a      expansion on the grounds of damage to the climate &#8212; activists strapped\u000d\u000a      copies of Tyndall research papers and reports to their bodies and created\u000d\u000a      a banner, \"Armed only with peer reviewed science\". The stunt was reported\u000d\u000a      widely in the media, and the research report presented to aviation sector\u000d\u000a      representatives on Newsnight. Dr Bows was later called to give formal\u000d\u000a      evidence at trial for the defence of airport expansion protesters.\u000d\u000a    Such exposure unquestionably heightened the public profile of\u000d\u000a      Tyndall-Manchester's aviation research, prompting stakeholders such as\u000d\u000a      Airbus, Easyjet and the Civil Aviation Authority to contact\u000d\u000a      Tyndall-Manchester, wishing to engage (see statement from the Secretary\u000d\u000a      General of the European Low Fares Airline Association [G]). This kept\u000d\u000a      Tyndall-Manchester's work at the forefront of the airport expansion\u000d\u000a      debate. The impacts of the Tyndall contribution to this debate and public\u000d\u000a      profile raising finally manifest in the formal withdrawal by BAA of its\u000d\u000a      planning application for a second Stansted runway on 24 May 2010 and in\u000d\u000a      the coalition government abolishing the policy to develop a third runway\u000d\u000a      at Heathrow. This latter retraction followed the ruling by Lord Justice\u000d\u000a      Carnwarth that the planned expansion did not properly take into account\u000d\u000a      the social costs of increased carbon emissions from aviation expansion\u000d\u000a      [I].\u000d\u000a    4) Local authority emissions accounting\u000d\u000a      Manchester City Council's climate change strategy adopted a new method for\u000d\u000a      emissions accounting [J] developed during Tyndall-Manchester's aviation\u000d\u000a      work accounting for aviation emissions in 2009 [6, above].\u000d\u000a      Tyndall-Manchester work informed the debate around the expansion of\u000d\u000a      individual regional airports, which in the Northwest have either been\u000d\u000a      overturned or delayed (corroborated by a confidential report from the\u000d\u000a      Association of Greater Manchester Authorities [K]).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Tyndall-Manchester's research into UK aviation emissions was instrumental\u000d\u000a      in overturning the prevailing orthodoxy, which regarded aviation as an\u000d\u000a      unproblematic, small source of greenhouse gas emissions. Identifying\u000d\u000a      drivers of growth and key characteristics of aviation's emerging emissions\u000d\u000a      trajectory demonstrated that aviation could soon dominate national\u000d\u000a      emissions if left unchecked. Tyndall-Manchester's research contributed to\u000d\u000a      aviation's inclusion in sub-national, national and international climate\u000d\u000a      policies. Specifically, it was highly influential in debates leading to\u000d\u000a      including international aviation in the UK's 2050 emissions target;\u000d\u000a      bringing aviation into \u000d\u000a\u0009  the European Union's Emission Trading System.

While aviation was widely taken to be an insignificant\u000d\u000a      contributor to global warming, Tyndall-Manchester's in-depth analysis of\u000d\u000a      the UK's emissions inventory and historical trends in aviation technology,\u000d\u000a      operations and activity, revealed the danger of overlooking emissions from\u000d\u000a      this growing sector. Coupling quantitative modelling with qualitative\u000d\u000a      interviews and workshops with industry and policy stakeholders, likely\u000d\u000a      drivers of current and future emissions growth were identified. Key\u000d\u000a      findings included: (1) Existing technology developments and improvements\u000d\u000a      in energy efficiency will take too long to deliver cuts to CO2 within\u000a      the timeframe necessary to meeting the UK's climate commitments. (2) That\u000d\u000a      rates of passenger\/airport growth anticipated by the industry and\u000d\u000a      supported by transport and planning policy bring the sector into stark\u000d\u000a      conflict with UK and EU climate change objectives. (3) That only a\u000d\u000a      comprehensive measure to manage demand could enable the UK's aviation\u000d\u000a      sector to remain commensurate with the UK's own emissions targets [1, 2,\u000d\u000a      5].\u000d\u000a    Placing aviation analysis in the context of the full energy system\u000d\u000a        (2004-2008)\u000d\u000a    A whole economy energy system model was developed which was the first of\u000d\u000a      its kind to include the emissions from international aviation and\u000d\u000a      shipping. By incorporating the aviation scenarios developed into a\u000d\u000a      quantitative analysis of the decarbonisation efforts required of the rest\u000d\u000a      of the economy, Tyndall-Manchester analysis prompted the startling\u000d\u000a      conclusion that, left unchecked, aviation could within a matter of decades\u000d\u000a      come to account for the large majority, if not all, of the future\u000d\u000a      CO2082 emissions generated in the UK and EU [1,3].\u000d\u000a    Assessing aviation within the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)\u000d\u000a        (2006-2008)\u000d\u000a    As debate around the inclusion of aviation within the EU ETS intensified,\u000d\u000a      Tyndall-Manchester assessed the economic and emissions implications of\u000d\u000a      including aviation within the EU ETS, finding only limited emissions\u000d\u000a      reductions were likely to flow from a moderate carbon price coupled with a\u000d\u000a      favoured `partial representation' of the aviation industry within the\u000d\u000a      scheme [4, 5].\u000d\u000a    Emission apportionment and sub-global policy interventions (2008-2010)\u000d\u000a    An investigation of the issue of policy influence and responsibility for\u000d\u000a      the production of aviation emissions yielded a novel method for\u000d\u000a      apportioning aviation emissions to sub-national regions, demonstrating the\u000d\u000a      significance of international aviation emissions at the local level, for\u000d\u000a      use within sub-national climate policy mechanisms [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28152","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context\u000a    Electron beam welding and diffusion bonding are typical joining processes\u000a      (in the final stages of\u000a      aero-engine assembly) used in the aerospace industries for a variety of\u000a      components and\u000a      structures. Insufficient bonding and defects such as porosity can occur if\u000a      the surfaces are not\u000a      perfectly clean from dirt, particles, oil\/grease and machine coolants. The\u000a      resultant cracking and\u000a      porosity leads to quality assurance failure of these very expensive parts\u000a      in this final stage of aero-\u000a      engine manufacture.\u000a    Prior to our research, the practice in use for E-beam welding of\u000a      aero-engine components was\u000a      either manual cleaning (up to 10 different steps) using chemicals and\u000a      abrasives or dipping the\u000a      components into a bath of concentrated HF (hydrofluoric acid) that is\u000a      highly corrosive and\u000a      hazardous, with chemical residuals sometimes becoming trapped (e.g. HF) in\u000a      the material [A].\u000a    Our research has shown that laser cleaning offers great advantages\u000a      eliminating the use of\u000a      chemicals and allowing the process to be fully automated and over 20 times\u000a      faster [A]. The new\u000a      technology allows precise control of the process, so that all contaminants\u000a      are removed, without\u000a      damage to the substrate surface.\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000a    The research work was carried out in collaboration with Rolls-Royce\u000a      (since 2003) and later (since\u000a      2009) with BAE Systems. The companies participated in all stages of the\u000a      R&amp;D (monthly review\u000a      meetings), provided the test materials, process requirements, welding and\u000a      diffusion bonding of\u000a      laser cleaned components, and testing of laser cleaned specimens and\u000a      components to industrial\u000a      standards [A,B]. Rolls-Royce subsequently certified and implemented the\u000a      technology. BAE\u000a      Systems is also taking up the technology for diffusion bonding surface\u000a      preparation.\u000a    This work was originally funded by Rolls-Royce (CASE studentship) and the\u000a      Northwest Science\u000a      Council (N0003200) with over &#163;1m. Following the successful application of\u000a      the technique at Rolls-\u000a      Royce since 2008, major funding from industry (Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems)\u000a      and EPSRC and TSB\u000a      of around &#163;2m was granted (SAMULET project) to further develop the laser\u000a      cleaning process for\u000a      diffusion bonding applications (2009-2013).\u000a    Reach and Significance of the Impact\u000a    The impact of our research is demonstrated by its adoption and use by the\u000a      leading UK aerospace\u000a      company Rolls-Royce &#8212; globally the second largest manufacturer of\u000a      aero-engines. In addition BAE\u000a      Systems is also now adopting the technology.\u000a    Rolls-Royce began introducing the laser cleaning technology, developed\u000a      through our research, for\u000a      E-beam welding of aero engine components in 2008. By May 2013, Rolls-Royce\u000a      had approved 24\u000a      different aero-engine components such as compressor drums in almost all\u000a      the current engine\u000a      families such as Trent 700, using the laser cleaning technology in the\u000a      manufacture of commercial\u000a      aero-engines [A]. The technology has shown improved productivity and\u000a      reduced failure rate. The\u000a      first time right rate using chemical methods was 82-90% and has improved\u000a      significantly utilising our\u000a      new laser cleaning method. In his statement [A] the global process owner\u000a      for laser processes at\u000a      Rolls-Royce confirms \"This automatic laser cleaning process has\u000a        replaced previous manual\u000a        chemical cleaning of parts for electron beam welding with significant\u000a        improvements in productivity\u000a        and first time right.\"\u000a    The economic impacts are multiple including cost savings in reducing\u000a      scraps at this final stage of\u000a      the aero engine assembly, estimated at several millions of &#163; per year and\u000a      elimination of the use of\u000a      harmful chemicals and their disposal, estimated at a few &#163; million per\u000a      year. In 2013, a new in-process\u000a      monitoring system, developed at the University of Manchester, was\u000a      installed at Rolls-Royce\u000a      for the monitoring of the laser cleaning process [A].\u000a    Following the successful use of laser cleaning of Ti alloys in welding,\u000a      the research has been further\u000a      developed (2009-2013) for diffusion bonding of a wide variety of aerospace\u000a      products. The diffusion\u000a      bonding of Trent 900 fan blades at Rolls-Royce, after laser cleaning, has\u000a      passed the quality\u000a      criteria. A modelling tool has been delivered to Rolls-Royce and BAE\u000a      Systems for laser cleaning\u000a      process evaluations. This tool has been successfully utilised by BAE\u000a      Systems to aid their decision-making\u000a      with regards to the installation of a laser cleaning system in the company\u000a      [B]. As a result\u000a      the laser cleaning technology is now being commissioned by BAE Systems for\u000a      military aircraft\u000a      manufacture, with the diffusion process replacing chemical cleaning [B].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at the University of Manchester on laser cleaning of Ti alloys\u000a      has resulted in practical\u000a      implementation of the technology at Rolls-Royce for the automatic\u000a      preparation of surfaces prior to\u000a      electron beam welding. This has been applied to 24 different aero-engine\u000a      component types\u000a      including compressor drums across most current engine families. This has\u000a      resulted in close to\u000a      100% `first time right' aero-engine component welds. The technology is\u000a      also being adopted by BAE\u000a      Systems to replace chemical cleaning during airframe manufacture.

We\u000a      have shown that:\u000a    \u000a      The continuous wave CO2 laser at 10.64 &#181;m wavelength and\u000a        nanosecond pulsed Nd:YAG\u000a        laser at 1.06 &#181;m wavelength were not suitable for cleaning aerospace\u000a        components with the\u000a        specific type of contaminants, for E-beam welding or diffusion bonding\u000a        applications,\u000a        because of their specific beam absorption characteristics (e.g. Nd:YAG\u000a        laser is transparent\u000a        to silicon grease) and thermal history (leading to excessive heat input\u000a        to the substrate\u000a        material if the contaminants are to be removed) [1,2,4].\u000a      The excimer laser at 248 nm wavelength at 8-20 nm pulse lengths was\u000a        the most suitable\u000a        tool for the cleaning the contaminants without damaging the substrate\u000a        alloys under specific\u000a        operating parameters [3].\u000a      The excimer laser removes organic contaminants mainly by\u000a        photo-chemical ablation\u000a        mechanisms while oxide particle removal is by photo-thermal ablation\u000a        [3].\u000a      Electron beam welded components following excimer laser cleaning were\u000a        shown to be\u000a        defect free after excimer laser cleaning [3].\u000a      We found the emission spectroscopy and probe beam reflection\u000a        techniques can be applied\u000a        to monitoring the laser cleaning process [5]. This has been further\u000a        developed by the same\u000a        research team using an acoustic monitoring technique in collaboration\u000a        with Rolls-Royce\u000a        and BAE System.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28153","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context\u000d\u000a    The fourteen AGR and the one Magnox reactors produce about 18% [A] of the\u000d\u000a      UK electricity. The graphite cores of these reactors provide channels for\u000d\u000a      fuel cooling and control rod entry. During reactor operation irradiation\u000d\u000a      damage and radiolytic oxidation changes the dimensions and properties of\u000d\u000a      the approximately 1700 tonnes of graphite components that make up a single\u000d\u000a      typical graphite reactor core. These changes can challenge the structural\u000d\u000a      integrity of the core. However, the irradiated graphite database for these\u000d\u000a      reactors is incomplete and the mechanisms driving the structural and\u000d\u000a      property changes are not well understood. Therefore, the reactor licensees\u000d\u000a      are required to make safety cases for continued operation of reactors\u000d\u000a      every three years.\u000d\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000d\u000a    The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) encouraged the establishment of\u000d\u000a      the Nuclear Graphite Research Group (NGRG) in 2001 to supply independent\u000d\u000a      research and advice on the structural integrity of nuclear graphite\u000d\u000a      reactor core components. The ONR also encouraged and enabled the NGRG to\u000d\u000a      gear up their funding by obtaining research funding in other related areas\u000d\u000a      from industry, the EU and EPSRC.\u000d\u000a    The codes, data, and statistical models developed by NGRG are made\u000d\u000a      available and have been adopted by the licensees operating nuclear power\u000d\u000a      reactors. In addition, the NGRG has made available the experimental\u000d\u000a      techniques and medium-scale facilities to industry.

Members of the NGRG also attended over\u000d\u000a      forty official licensee\/ONR meetings [E] to offer advice and critical\u000d\u000a      input.\u000d\u000a    Significant advances in computational power have enabled development of\u000d\u000a      sophisticated numerical models and data analysis techniques for single\u000d\u000a      components through to whole cores [1, 2, 6]. This is key to interrogating\u000d\u000a      safety cases for reactors as experimental data on whole components and\u000d\u000a      reactors under operating conditions through life is impossible to obtain:\u000d\u000a    The advice given by the NGRG ensured that Oldbury continued safe\u000d\u000a      operation for 44 years, until 2012. \"Both of the site's reactors were\u000d\u000a      scheduled to close at the end of 2008, and since that time the site has\u000d\u000a      generated an additional 7 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity, worth an\u000d\u000a      estimated &#163;300 million to the taxpayer.

Also, it is\u000a      imperative that process efficiencies are improved to meet stringent\u000a      regulations and environmental legalisation. Process Integration Technology\u000a      (Pinch Technology) pioneered at Manchester was developed to address such\u000a      issues and has been extensively used by the process industry worldwide.\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000a      Manchester's CPI is a recognised centre of excellence and has maintained\u000a      close links with industry through the Process Integration Research\u000a      Consortium (PIRC). The computer software developed in CPI has enabled\u000a      effective technology transfer and commercial exploitation of our\u000a      underpinning research outputs by the thirteen companies comprising PIRC.\u000a      In total, six software packages have been developed for heat recovery\u000a      systems, utility systems, distillation systems cryogenic systems, water\u000a      integration and refinery modelling &amp; optimisation. Process Integration\u000a      Ltd (PIL) was spun-out from Manchester in 2007 to provide an effective\u000a      route to market. The software has been further developed to commercial\u000a      standards and licensed by PIL, which currently employs over 50 people in\u000a      Manchester, Beijing and Houston, for either sale to industry (14 copies,\u000a      US$100k per copy) or for internal use by PIL on consultancy projects (35\u000a      major projects) [C1].\u000a    Reach and Significance of Impact\u000a    Heat Recovery Systems\u000a      Despite the cost saving and environmental benefits associated with reduced\u000a      consumption of finite non-renewable energy resources, it is difficult to\u000a      justify capital investment on retrofit for energy saving of an existing\u000a      process.\u000a    The new methods developed in CPI have allowed more cost-effective\u000a      retrofit of heat recovery systems and simultaneous heat recovery and\u000a      process optimisation. To date, three software licences have been sold and\u000a      sixteen commercial studies have been carried out on various process units\u000a      from refining to petrochemicals. Savings related directly to the use of\u000a      these CPI methods can be considerable [C2, C3], for example Sinopec has,\u000a      since 2009, saved 15 MW of energy worth approximately US$25m, and savings\u000a      will continue at a rate of ca. US$5m\/year [C4]. BP envisages savings worth\u000a      approximately US$4.4m\/year per typical major refinery [C3].\u000a    Utility systems\u000a      Most processes operate in the context of an existing site in which a\u000a      number of processes are linked to the same steam and power system. Such\u000a      utility systems are the largest energy consumers on most processing sites\u000a      and therefore offer the opportunity of substantial savings.\u000a    Manchester has developed improved methods for the simulation and\u000a      operational optimisation of utility systems that have enable without\u000a      capital expenditure substantial reductions in fuel consumption, fuel\u000a      costs, increased power production and lower CO2 emissions.\u000a      Eleven commercial studies have been undertaken on utility systems for\u000a      Sinopec resulting in energy savings of US$250m since 2009 and these\u000a      savings will continue at a rate of ca. US$50m\/year [C4]. In addition,\u000a      revenue has been generated by licencing eight copies of the software to\u000a      PCITC and LPEC in China.\u000a    Refinery hydrogen networks\u000a      After the cost of purchasing crude oil and the cost of energy to run a\u000a      refinery, the next biggest cost is that of hydrogen. Changes in\u000a      environmental regulations and increased use of heavy crude oil have\u000a      increased the demand for hydrogen in refineries significantly. This has\u000a      necessitated more efficient use of hydrogen and significant investment in\u000a      hydrogen generation and purification, which consumes a significant amount\u000a      of energy.\u000a    Manchester's systematic methods have for the first time provided\u000a      petroleum companies with insight into how to improve the refinery hydrogen\u000a      networks. Industrial process engineers have the benefit of not only\u000a      powerful mathematical tools, but also the insights that simple graphical\u000a      methods present.\u000a    Three software licences have been sold to Sinopec and PetroChina in\u000a      China. Also, eight commercial studies have been undertaken on refinery\u000a      hydrogen networks for Sinopec that have saved the company US$50M, since\u000a      2009, comprising savings in natural gas and additional revenue generated\u000a      from the recovery of light hydrocarbons. These savings will continue at a\u000a      rate of ca. US$10m\/year. [C4]. In addition, a major study has also been\u000a      carried out for Shell Deutschland, but the results are commercial in\u000a      confidence.\u000a    Petroleum refinery molecular modelling\u000a      The demand for higher quality products in conjunction with more stringent\u000a      environmental regulations has caused the refining industry to move towards\u000a      better characterisation of the composition of refinery streams.\u000a    The methodology developed at Manchester allows more effective molecular\u000a      management in refining through better modelling and optimisation.\u000a    Three commercial studies have been carried out on refinery optimisation\u000a      for Sinopec that have saved US$25m, since 2009, in increased product value\u000a      and on-going savings of ca. US$5m\/year. More recently, PIL and Sinopec\u000a      established a joint venture that has developed a new software system based\u000a      on a research output from CPI. The software has the potential to make\u000a      significant improvements in the efficiency of exploitation of crude oil.\u000a      To date, the software has been validated on two Chinese refineries of\u000a      Sinopec, two trial software licences have been issued for evaluation and\u000a      is currently being launched commercially. The sales price of the software\u000a      will be around US$225k per copy [C1].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The field of conceptual chemical process design as practiced industrially\u000a      has been influenced significantly by the outputs from the Centre for\u000a      Process Integration (CPI) at Manchester.

Heat recovery systems\u000a      New approaches to heat exchanger design and retrofit were researched and\u000a      developed that combine mathematical modelling with thermodynamic analysis.\u000a      The approach has been proven to be particularly well-suited to the\u000a      retrofit of existing heat recovery systems by allowing more cost effective\u000a      improvement of existing processes. A fundamental understanding of the\u000a      principles that underpin the limitations of existing heat exchanger\u000a      networks has provided a much more systematic and practical insight [1]. In\u000a      addition, the approaches developed for the design and retrofit of heat\u000a      recovery systems have been able to be combined effectively with process\u000a      models to allow much better improvements in profitability than when the\u000a      heat recovery system is tackled alone [4].\u000a    2. Utility systems\u000a      Underpinning research conducted at Manchester has developed new and much\u000a      more effective methods for the design and optimisation of complex utility\u000a      systems. Such utility systems are a common feature of all chemical\u000a      processing and are huge energy consumers. This has required an approach to\u000a      modelling such systems that accounts for the part-load performance of\u000a      equipment and at the same time allows more effective optimisation of the\u000a      total system. The modelling environment developed has been implemented for\u000a      system design and retrofit or for the operational improvement of an\u000a      existing system with no capital expenditure [2].\u000a    3. Refinery hydrogen networks\u000a      Research at Manchester has developed systematic methods for improving\u000a      refinery hydrogen networks &#8212; a critical feature of the design and\u000a      operation of petroleum refineries. Various processes produce fresh\u000a      hydrogen, produce waste hydrogen and consume hydrogen at different\u000a      conditions. Effective integration of these processes is critical to\u000a      profitable operation. The methods developed provided for the first time\u000a      insights into the complex interactions that take place. Graphical methods\u000a      [3] have been developed, together with mathematical optimisation methods\u000a      [5]. The methods set the minimum hydrogen supply required by the hydrogen\u000a      network and allow systematic screening of purification processes for\u000a      integration within the network. Prior to this work, no methods were\u000a      available for the systematic analysis of refinery hydrogen networks.\u000a    4. Petroleum refinery molecular modelling\u000a      Petroleum refineries have conventionally modelled refinery streams and\u000a      processes using only bulk properties, such as density, boiling point, etc.\u000a      The composition of the streams has traditionally been considered to be too\u000a      complex to allow a more fundamental approach. Research at Manchester has\u000a      developed a way of modelling refinery streams and processes on a molecular\u000a      basis. Critical to this is the ability to relate bulk properties to\u000a      molecular make-up [6]. The molecular modelling approach can be used for\u000a      the first time to manage the flow of specific molecular species through\u000a      the refinery to allow better exploitation of the crude oil resource and\u000a      increase profitability.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28171","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context\u000d\u000a    Chemical sensors for process industries including water, oil &amp; gas\u000d\u000a      and manufacturing are prone to\u000d\u000a      failure due to the harsh environments in which they have to operate.\u000d\u000a      Environmental managers are\u000d\u000a      increasingly required to detect and quantify trace gases and vapours of\u000d\u000a      land, air and water sites in-order\u000d\u000a      to meet the regulatory and legal requirements concerning environmental\u000d\u000a      pollution. Prior to\u000d\u000a      our research, industry was unable to monitor trace levels of gaseous\u000d\u000a      contaminants, odours, or\u000d\u000a      other chemicals as available instrumentation was not sufficiently\u000d\u000a      sensitive to detect the low\u000d\u000a      concentrations involved.

The non-contact approach is vital to providing the highest level\u000d\u000a      of protection of plant,\u000d\u000a      equipment, customers and the environment.

This exposure generated significant interest within the UK and\u000d\u000a      from international\u000d\u000a      countries including USA, Korea and Japan. Proof of principle funding from\u000d\u000a      The University of\u000d\u000a      Manchester allowed the E-nose sensor to be patented, developed, tested and\u000d\u000a      endorsed. Testing\u000d\u000a      and endorsement was carried out by the Water Research Council UK. The\u000d\u000a      E-nose was\u000d\u000a      subsequently spun-out as Multisensor Systems Ltd in 2007.\u000d\u000a    Reach and Significance of the Impact\u000d\u000a    Multisensor Systems Ltd\u000d\u000a    From 2008 pilot sales of E-nose to UK Water companies generated sales\u000d\u000a      revenue worth &#163;150k.\u000d\u000a      Achieving CE marking &amp; compliance testing certification led to sales\u000d\u000a      of instruments (ca. 60) to\u000d\u000a      companies including the major UK water companies and the US Airforce. In\u000d\u000a      2010, independent\u000d\u000a      investor funding allowed the hiring of the first full time employees, and\u000d\u000a      today 6 people are\u000d\u000a      employed. Multisensor Systems Ltd began to subcontract instrument\u000d\u000a      manufacture, which provided\u000d\u000a      two further positions within a small company based in Yorkshire.

From 2005 to 2010 the UK water and sewerage\u000d\u000a      utilities collectively\u000d\u000a      invested a total of &#163;20bn in their infrastructure and will invest a\u000d\u000a      similar amount in the period 2010 to\u000d\u000a      2015. E-nose provides an effective, on-line, real-time monitoring and\u000d\u000a      alarm generation for the\u000d\u000a      protection of raw water intakes, alerting users to fuel leaks by\u000d\u000a      monitoring oil levels in water. In 2008\u000d\u000a      Multisensor Ltd collaborated with Yorkshire Water to develop the Volatile\u000d\u000a      Organic Compound\u000d\u000a      (VOC) sensor system which can be used on both wastewater and water\u000d\u000a      treatment plants.\u000d\u000a      Following the successful implementation of the sensor in North Yorkshire,\u000d\u000a      the major UK water\u000d\u000a      companies now use this sensor.\u000d\u000a    Anglian Water Services Ltd is the largest water and wastewater company in\u000d\u000a      England and Wales\u000d\u000a      servicing six million domestic and business customers and delivering ca.\u000d\u000a      1.2 billion litres of water\u000d\u000a      each day. It uses several VOC monitoring systems originally developed\u000d\u000a      using the innovative\u000d\u000a      E-nose research carried out at The University of Manchester. Peter\u000d\u000a      Barratt, senior water quality\u000d\u000a      specialist, says \"The E-nose technology we use has provided a\u000d\u000a        significant reduction in risk to plant\u000d\u000a        and customer water supplies; intake protection on higher risk lower\u000d\u000a        abstraction cost sources will\u000d\u000a        save operational expenditure and may prevent or delay capital\u000d\u000a        expenditure.\" [ii]. In addition, per\u000d\u000a      installation, the costs of servicing a conventional monitoring unit would\u000d\u000a      be typically around &#163;4,800\u000d\u000a      compared with just &#163;400 for the Multisensor system. With more than 200\u000d\u000a      units currently installed,\u000d\u000a      the savings in servicing alone are considerable [i].\u000d\u000a    Regulations limiting the levels of Trihalomethanes (THMs), a carcinogenic\u000d\u000a      by-product of\u000d\u000a      disinfectants, in drinking water have made it essential, throughout the\u000d\u000a      distribution network, to have\u000d\u000a      the ability to measure low levels of these compounds. Multisensor's THM\u000d\u000a      monitor provides that\u000d\u000a      facility efficiently and accurately, with users in the UK, Europe and the\u000d\u000a      rest of the world.

The non-use of chemicals means zero waste and maintenance\u000d\u000a        free technology [iii].\u000d\u000a      Heyward Inc., USA, have also used Multisensor's THM monitor since 2010\u000d\u000a      throughout their\u000d\u000a      distribution network (the entire southeast and mid-Atlantic United States)\u000d\u000a      to ensure that their clients\u000d\u000a      are meeting the regulatory and legal requirements. Michael Ping, Heyward\u000d\u000a      Inc. Engineer, says\u000d\u000a      \"The E-nose technology is used to monitor and minimise chemical dosage\u000d\u000a        at our water treatment\u000d\u000a        plants. This reduces our potential liability as we meet regulations and\u000d\u000a        the system offers effective\u000d\u000a        cost savings to our company\" [iv]. Energy savings in THM reduction\u000d\u000a      systems, brought about\u000d\u000a      through the use of the THM monitor, are estimated to be in excess of &#163;300k\u000d\u000a      per annum for each\u000d\u000a      system. Associated reductions in chemical usage are estimated to be 31%\u000d\u000a      (equivalent to ca. &#163;45k\u000d\u000a      per year). In addition to these direct savings, the value of regulatory\u000d\u000a      compliance is clearly\u000d\u000a      significant [i, v].\u000d\u000a    Manufacturing Industry\u000d\u000a    In 2010 Cummins Engineering Company, a global diesel engine manufacturer\u000d\u000a      implemented\u000d\u000a      Multisensor System's VOC detection instrument at their Darlington engine\u000d\u000a      test facility.

As a result,\u000a      most companies have to rely\u000a      on external consultants, which often inhibits them from estimating carbon\u000a      footprints because of\u000a      associated costs and confidentiality. Furthermore, most previous\u000a      approaches have only considered\u000a      estimation of carbon emitted directly by organisations rather than the\u000a      emissions along the whole\u000a      supply chain &#8212; a key requirement in mitigating climate change. CCaLC\u000a      overcomes these barriers\u000a      by enabling them to estimate the carbon footprint and identify optimal\u000a      reduction strategies in-house.\u000a      The research laid the foundations for addressing these issues by taking a\u000a      life cycle\u000a      approach with the aim of helping companies to identify carbon reduction\u000a      opportunities from `cradle\u000a      to grave', in-house.\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000a    We recognised that the key to achieving practical impact from the work\u000a      was to embed the rigorous\u000a      CCaLC methodology in software tools simple enough to be used by\u000a      non-experts. Working with the\u000a      18 industry partners in the research (joined subsequently by 15+ others),\u000a      we developed a suite of\u000a      software tools incorporating a database with 6000+ data entries: CCaLC\u000a      for estimation of carbon\u000a      footprints applicable to all sectors; CCaLC Optimiser for\u000a      optimisation of carbon footprints\u000a      applicable to all sectors; CCaLC PVC applicable to the PVC sector;\u000a      and CCaLC BIOCHEM\u000a      applicable to the industrial biotechnology (IB) sector. To encourage\u000a      uptake, CCaLC is provided\u000a      free of charge. The first version was launched in July 2010 and up to 31\u000a      July 2013 had around\u000a      3300 users from more than 70 countries. Several updates have been released\u000a      since the launch\u000a      (currently v.3.1). To aid dissemination, we worked closely with the\u000a      Chemistry Innovation\u000a      Knowledge Transfer Network (CIKTN), who helped disseminate CCaLC widely\u000a      across industry.\u000a      Examples of dissemination routes pursued by CIKTN included promotion to\u000a      250 SMEs across\u000a      Europe to stimulate innovation in bio-based products, presentations to\u000a      over 150 UK businesses, a\u000a      series of industry events, and the CIKTN website. CCaLC is also included\u000a      in CIKTN's Sustainable\u000a      Design Guide to help drive innovation [A]. Amongst new partners was the\u000a      World Bank who, as a\u000a      result, recommend CCaLC as part of their Platform for Climate-Smart\u000a      Planning [B].\u000a    Reach and Significance\u000a    CCaLC's international user base is made up of companies (~65%),\u000a      government bodies (~10%)\u000a      and others (~25%), including universities and individuals. CCaLC has\u000a      significant geographical\u000a      reach: 50% of users are UK-based, 25% are based in rest of Europe and 25%\u000a      span countries as\u000a      diverse as Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia and USA.\u000a      Examples of specific\u000a      impacts are given below for four key industrial sectors.\u000a    PVC Industry: PVC is one of the most extensively used plastics in\u000a      the world with current global\u000a      demand of 37 Mt and a forecast annual growth of ~5% from 2011-2020. The\u000a      European PVC sector\u000a      is committed to carbon reductions through VinylPlus, an ongoing 10-year\u000a      voluntary initiative to\u000a      improve its sustainability. The CCaLC-PVC software has been used for the\u000a      reduction and\u000a      management of the carbon footprints of PVC products, processes and supply\u000a      chains. It has been\u000a      endorsed by DEFRA [C], and across the PVC sector, including by the British\u000a      Plastics Federation\u000a      and INEOS ChlorVinyls &#8212; a leading VinylPlus partner and Europe's largest\u000a      PVC producer,\u000a      employing 3000 people. Using CCaLC has provided INEOS with the insight\u000a      that the use of\u000a      recycled PVC offers a 20-fold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\u000a      compared to virgin\u000a      product, leading directly to a focus on recycling as a pathway to reducing\u000a      the industry's emissions\u000a      [D]. Currently Europe recycles 100 kt pa of waste PVC window frames,\u000a      equivalent to a saving of\u000a      around 200 kt CO2 eq. pa [2] - a &#163;42m pa saving through\u000a      mitigation of climate change based on\u000a      the findings of the Stern Report. Use of CCaLC showed that achieving the\u000a      VinylPlus target of 800\u000a      kt pa recycled PVC by 2020 would result in a 1.6 Mt pa reduction in CO2\u000a      eq. emissions, equivalent\u000a      to 2.4% of the emissions from the sector. CCaLC also showed that a saving\u000a      of 6.7 Mt CO2 eq. pa\u000a      could be achieved by using a new non-aqueous polymerisation route, instead\u000a      of the current\u000a      aqueous process [D]. This would represent a 10% saving of annual GHG\u000a      emissions for the whole\u000a      PVC sector, half of the emission reduction target of 20% set by VinylPlus\u000a      for 2020 and, based on\u000a      Stern's findings, equivalent to a saving of &#163;360m in mitigation of climate\u000a      change. Summarising the\u000a      impact, INEOS ChlorVinyl state that \"CCaLC is increasingly being used\u000a        across the PVC sector,\u000a        and is viewed as a central plank in the European PVC industry's carbon\u000a        commitment. ...It has\u000a        proved valuable because it continues to provide a simple yet effective\u000a        tool to illustrate how various\u000a        players in the vinyl value chain can make a difference to carbon and\u000a        other environmental savings.\"\u000a      [D].\u000a    Industrial Biotechnology: In recognising that the industrial\u000a      biotechnology (IB) sector will be \"one\u000a      of the strongest driving forces behind the world's low-carbon revolution\",\u000a      the BERR (now BIS) IB\u000a      Innovation and Growth Team for UK Government recommended adoption of CCaLC\u000a      as the\u000a      preferred toolkit for the calculation of carbon footprint [E].\u000a      Subsequently, CCaLC is now used\u000a      across the IB sector to identify carbon hot spots and improvement\u000a      opportunities. An example is the\u000a      UK-based speciality-chemicals company Croda International, who have 3400\u000a      employees in 34\u000a      countries, and boast revenues in excess of &#163;1bn. Croda manufactures 70% of\u000a      its chemicals using\u000a      renewable materials and use CCaLC to calculate the carbon footprint of\u000a      their products. As a result,\u000a      they found out that, contrary to their expectations, the GHG emissions\u000a      from cultivating raw\u000a      materials are typically twice those from the manufacturing process [F]. In\u000a      2011 Croda rolled-out\u000a      CCaLC across the whole company, training 18 key staff internationally in\u000a      its application; CCaLC is\u000a      now used routinely to monitor opportunities for carbon reduction [G].\u000a      Commenting on the\u000a      usefulness of CCaLC not only for identifying improvement opportunities but\u000a      also for responding to\u000a      increasing requests by their customers for information on the carbon\u000a      footprint of their products,\u000a      Croda state that \"Without CCaLC, Croda would not be able to provide\u000a        useful and meaningful\u000a        information to our customers without significantly more work and cost,\u000a        ...which could potentially\u000a        result in lost business.\" [F]\u000a    Healthcare Industry: GSK, one of the world's largest health-care\u000a      companies, used CCaLC, in\u000a      collaboration with the UoA, to estimate the carbon footprint of 20 key\u000a      products, including asthma\u000a      inhalers and Horlicks. CCaLC showed that, contrary to company's\u000a      expectations, the use and end-\u000a      of-life of these products add significantly to the company's carbon\u000a      footprint. For example, Ventolin,\u000a      used by ~300 million asthma sufferers worldwide, is one of the main\u000a      contributors to the total\u000a      carbon footprint of the company owing to the use of HFA-134a propellant.\u000a      To reduce the carbon\u000a      footprint, GSK have started to collect and recycle waste inhalers which\u000a      still contain a significant\u000a      amount of unused HFA &#8212; in the UK alone, 90,000 inhalers have been\u000a      collected to date, saving\u000a      682 t CO2 [H]. CCaLC has also shown that large carbon\u000a      reductions can be achieved by replacing\u000a      Ventolin with a dry powder inhaler also produced by GSK, saving 630 kt CO2\u000a      eq. per year, or 10%\u000a      of GSK's total GHG gas emissions. GSK are also working with suppliers to\u000a      reduce the carbon\u000a      emissions in their supply chain, for example in the production of milk\u000a      used in Horlicks, which\u000a      contributes more than half of the 800 kt CO2 from this product.\u000a      GSK state that \"Having a tool like\u000a        CCaLC is very powerful as we can quickly get into very detailed\u000a        discussions on how to work with\u000a        suppliers to reduce supply chain carbon footprint as well as reduce\u000a        overall cost.\" [I]\u000a    Food Industry: Kellogg's, one of the world's leading producers of\u000a      cereals and convenience foods,\u000a      with sales of ~$13 billion, are committed to reducing energy use, GHG\u000a      emissions and water use by\u000a      15-20% by 2015 (on 2005). The company has been using CCaLC since 2010 to\u000a      estimate the\u000a      carbon footprint of their entire product range (ca. 2000 products),\u000a      allowing them to track the cradle-\u000a      to-grave impact for the first time [J]. They were surprised to find that\u000a      transport had a low\u000a      contribution to their carbon footprint, enabling them to refocus on areas\u000a      of product life cycle that\u000a      have a higher contribution, such as raw materials, packaging and energy\u000a      efficiency. CCaLC\u000a      estimates have shown clearly that Kellogg's carbon footprint can be\u000a      reduced by up to 20% by\u000a      focusing on these life cycle stages, helping the Company meet their 2015\u000a      targets [J]. Kellogg's\u000a      have also found CCaLC to be useful in product design, helping them choose\u000a      low-impact\u000a      ingredients and recipes. An example is Special K, for which both\u000a      carbon and water footprints were\u000a      reduced by up to 20% as a result of using CCaLC [J]. The company state\u000a      that \"CCaLC has helped\u000a        Kellogg's to identify business-wide hot spots and provide focus in terms\u000a        of future priorities for\u000a        carbon reductions along the entire value chain ...

In diesel fuel\u000a      injection components, hole diameters can be less than 150 &#181;m in diameter.\u000a      Previous fuel injection nozzles had straight or parallel walled holes that\u000a      generally had a neck at the end of the hole where the final drilling took\u000a      place. This affected fuel flow and the fuel did not spread well for\u000a      effective combustion. It is desirable to have reverse tapered hopes (i.e.\u000a      fuel entrance hole is larger than the fuel exit) so that the fuel can\u000a      spread out into a fan-shaped spray. However, there had been no practical\u000a      solution for the manufacture of reverse tapered holes as drilling takes\u000a      place from the outside of the nozzle. The hole size at the tool entry\u000a      needs to be smaller than the hole size at the tool exit. The University of\u000a      Manchester in collaboration with Delphi Diesel Systems (Germany) and GFH\u000a      GmbH, pioneered the reverse tapered hole drilling technique which resulted\u000a      in worldwide application of the technology in the automobile industry\u000a      satisfying the new EU emission Euro 5, introduced in 2008-2009 [A-D].\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000a    The work was done in collaboration with Delphi and GFH GmbH who provided\u000a      PhD CASE funding and access to experimental facilities (e.g. EDM), fuel\u000a      injection nozzle testing facilities, and materials. The research findings\u000a      from the project were then commercialised as diesel fuel injection nozzle\u000a      production systems [A-C].\u000a    Reach and Significance of the Impact\u000a    Automobile component manufacturers. The reverse tapered hole\u000a      production technology was first introduced into diesel engineer fuel\u000a      injection nozzle manufacture at full scale by Delphi, one of the major car\u000a      component manufacturers. The technology was patented by Delphi [D] and\u000a      then certified by them to meet the new EU emission legislation Euro 5, in\u000a      2008-2009 [A-E]. The major differences between Euro 4 (introduced in 2005)\u000a      and Euro 5 legislation (introduced in 2008\/2009) are that for diesel\u000a      engines, the NOx emission limit was reduced from 0.25 g\/km (Euro 4) to\u000a      0.18 g\/km (Euro 5), and particulate matter emission from 0.025 g\/km (Euro\u000a      4) to 0.005 g\/km (Euro 5) [E]. The key benefits of the new fuel injection\u000a      nozzle manufacturing technology include improved fuel efficiency and\u000a      reduced environmental impacts (1.5% fuel saving per nozzle, 35-40%\u000a      reduction in particulate matter emission, 20% reduction in NOx emission,\u000a      3% reduction in CO2 emission, and a reduction of 10&#176;C in\u000a      exhaust temperature) [F]. Delphi's diesel engine component business was\u000a      &#8364;1.6bn in 2008. Because of satisfying Euro 5 conditions in 2008\/9 due to\u000a      the introduction of reverse tapered fuel injection nozzle holes [A,B],\u000a      their business had grown to &#8364;2.4bn per year in the following years [G].\u000a    Passenger car and truck manufacturers. Reserve tapered hole diesel\u000a      fuel injection nozzles are currently used by major passenger car and truck\u000a      manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Ford, Isuzu, Volvo and Renault [A-C].

We introduced the idea and pioneered the technology\u000a      for drilling reverse tapered holes by a specific configuration of\u000a      electro-discharge machining (EDM). The key findings from the research\u000a      were:\u000a    \u000a      We showed that by incorporating the electro-discharge machining (EDM)\u000a        fuel injection drilling system with a specific rotational motion\u000a        control, reverse tapered holes could be produced (with exit hole\u000a        diameter greater than the entrance hole diameter where the tool enters)\u000a        [1].\u000a      We showed that this new hole shape improved fuel efficiency and\u000a        reduced environmental impacts and associated NOx production with an\u000a        optimized degree of taper [1].\u000a      We showed that this new drilling technique met the productivity and\u000a        repeatability requirements for diesel fuel injection nozzle production\u000a        [1].\u000a      This research demonstrated a new drilling method, combining laser\u000a        pilot hole drilling followed by electro-discharge machining (EDM), which\u000a        has resulted in a 70% reduction in drilling time compared with standard\u000a        EDM drilling, 42% reduction in cost, and 90% increase in capacity of\u000a        existing fuel injection nozzle manufacturing equipment with similar hole\u000a        quality [2].\u000a      In diesel fuel injection nozzle manufacture, EDM drilled holes\u000a        typically have an undesirable keyhole that affects the fuel flow.

This\u000d\u000a      led to the building of a research vessel RV Triton, which was sold\u000d\u000a      in 2002 after having completed\u000d\u000a      extensive trials. Over the past 5+ years it has been used by the\u000d\u000a      Australian Customs and Border\u000d\u000a      Protection Service (ACBP) as a coastal patrol and fisheries protection\u000d\u000a      vessel on the northern\u000d\u000a      tropical coast of Australia. ACV Triton was refitted with additional\u000d\u000a      accommodation, a more powerful\u000d\u000a      propulsion plant, and a command and control centre which was easily\u000d\u000a      facilitated within its trimaran\u000d\u000a      hullform, which itself remained unchanged. Triton was selected over\u000d\u000a      alternative equivalent\u000d\u000a      monohull vessels for the patrol role because the trimaran hullform that\u000d\u000a      UCL designed offers lower\u000d\u000a      resistance, improved sea-keeping and improved larger upper deck area,\u000d\u000a      which enhances\u000d\u000a      operational capability. These advantages manifest themselves in achieving\u000d\u000a      a superior range and\u000d\u000a      improved fuel economy resulting from its inherently lower resistance;\u000d\u000a      higher operating speeds\u000d\u000a      which is important to the ACBP since the ships are used to catch\u000d\u000a      smugglers; and its large working\u000d\u000a      deck area which allows for multiple operations of helicopters and boats.\u000d\u000a      Overall, the impact of\u000d\u000a      using a trimaran in this role has provided enhanced capability at lower\u000d\u000a      fuel consumption and\u000d\u000a      reduced emissions over similar sized monohull or catamaran vessels [a].\u000d\u000a    At the end of the Cold War the US Navy determined a need for new ship\u000d\u000a      types to combat\u000d\u000a      asymmetrical littoral (close to shore) threats and the littoral combat\u000d\u000a      ship (LCS) concept was born.\u000d\u000a      In 2010, Austal's USS Independence was the first modular\u000d\u000a      high-speed trimaran LCS to be\u000d\u000a      commissioned into the US Navy; this was followed in 2012 by USS\u000d\u000a        Coronado, a second trimaran\u000d\u000a      vessel of similar design that completed trials in August 2013. Four more\u000d\u000a      trimaran Independence\u000d\u000a        Class vessels have been ordered since 2008, including USS\u000d\u000a        Jackson, construction of which began\u000d\u000a      in 2012 [d], and eventually a fleet of 20+ LCS trimaran vessels are\u000d\u000a      expected [b]. An important\u000d\u000a      economic benefit of the trimaran LCS programme has been to support jobs at\u000d\u000a      Austal in Alabama,\u000d\u000a      USA, which has been able to double its workforce to 3,800 [e]. In 2010,\u000d\u000a      the Navy awarded Austal a\u000d\u000a      $432-million contract to build a trimaran LCS, with a further $681-million\u000d\u000a      contract for two more\u000d\u000a      ships awarded in March 2013 [b, c].\u000d\u000a    The trimaran Independence Class LCS design has been tested\u000d\u000a      thoroughly by the US Navy and\u000d\u000a      shown to provide significant benefits to naval operations, including the\u000d\u000a      largest usable payload\u000d\u000a      volume per tonne of ship displacement of all US Navy surface combatants, a\u000d\u000a      large flight deck that\u000d\u000a      has facilitated near simultaneous operation of two helicopters and proven\u000d\u000a      capability of operating\u000d\u000a      the large H-53 helicopter, and operations of multiple unmanned vehicles\u000d\u000a      for reconnaissance and\u000d\u000a      warfare operations. The increased stability of the trimaran hullform has\u000d\u000a      improved flight operations\u000d\u000a      by allowing them to be achieved in higher sea-states than equivalent-sized\u000d\u000a      monohulls and\u000d\u000a      catamarans. Other operational benefits result from the ability of the\u000d\u000a      trimaran configuration to\u000d\u000a      effectively decouple the resistance\/powering from the stability relative\u000d\u000a      to an equivalent monohull\u000d\u000a      which can yield a reduction in resistance at higher speeds. The subsequent\u000d\u000a      reduction in the\u000d\u000a      vessel's full-speed power requirements allows a corresponding reduction of\u000d\u000a      around one-third in\u000d\u000a      both fuel consumption and associated emissions [c]. Chief of Naval\u000d\u000a      Operations Adm. Gary\u000d\u000a      Roughead praised the Navy's plan to add both ship designs to the fleet\u000d\u000a      [2010]: \"The LCS is\u000d\u000a        uniquely designed to win against 21st century threats in coastal waters\u000d\u000a        posed by increasingly\u000d\u000a        capable submarines, mines and swarming small craft. Both designs provide\u000d\u000a        the capabilities our\u000d\u000a        Navy needs, and each offers unique features that will provide fleet\u000d\u000a        commanders with a high level of\u000d\u000a        flexibility in employing these ships.\" [c]\u000d\u000a    The trimaran concept is also useful for commercial vessels: the trimaran\u000d\u000a      ferry Benchijigua Express\u000d\u000a      entered service in 2005 and has been successfully used to carry cars and\u000d\u000a      passengers between the\u000d\u000a      Canary Islands throughout the REF impact period. The design of the ferry,\u000d\u000a      also built by Austal,\u000d\u000a      draws on the experimental results UCL obtained from its role in the\u000d\u000a      development of RV Triton [h].\u000d\u000a      In common with other trimaran designs, the reduced resistance resulting\u000d\u000a      from its three slender\u000d\u000a      hullforms means the ferry uses much less fuel at its high speed (40+ knot\u000d\u000a      operation) when\u000d\u000a      compared to an equivalent-sized catarmaran or monohull, which confers an\u000d\u000a      important advantage in\u000d\u000a      the competitive ferry market [i]. Benchijigua Express ferry's\u000d\u000a      improved stability also ensures a softer\u000d\u000a      roll, enhancing passenger comfort. Auto-Express, the second\u000d\u000a      generation of trimaran passenger\u000d\u000a      ferries launched in 2012, offers further benefits still. The improved\u000d\u000a      design has resulted in an\u000d\u000a      increased waterline length providing improved internal volume and a speed\u000d\u000a      of 39 knots [g].\u000d\u000a      According to the Head of Research and Development at Austal: \"The\u000d\u000a        trimaran offers greater speed\u000d\u000a        for the same cargo weight and the same power compared to a monohull and\u000d\u000a        a catamaran. It's got\u000d\u000a        better passenger comfort, by which I mean less sea-sickness. It's got a\u000d\u000a        better sea-keeping ability &#8212;\u000d\u000a        able to operate in higher sea states... The power consumption is\u000d\u000a        reduced about 20% when\u000d\u000a        operating in a seaway compared to a catamaran...and reduced by as much\u000d\u000a        as 50% when\u000d\u000a        compared with a monohull operating in waves...\" [g].\u000d\u000a    The rules governing the design of ships (naval and commercial) are\u000d\u000a      predominantly the\u000d\u000a      responsibility of national Classification Societies such as Lloyds\u000d\u000a      Register (LR) for UK. New\u000d\u000a      Classification Society Rules for Trimaran Ships were developed in 2004,\u000d\u000a      with UCL involvement\u000d\u000a      and drawing on expertise developed during the research described in\u000d\u000a      Section 2. Since 2008, the\u000d\u000a      Marine Research Group at UCL has been assisting LR with the approval of\u000d\u000a      new rules governing\u000d\u000a      naval vessel designs including structure and propulsion, thereby providing\u000d\u000a      the foundations that\u000d\u000a      enable ship builders to offer trimaran ships to their customers.

The trimaran consists of three parallel slim hullforms joined\u000d\u000a      using a cross-deck structure\u000d\u000a      rather than a single wider monohull. Research at UCL demonstrated, through\u000d\u000a      a series of\u000d\u000a      computational and experimental research studies, that the trimaran\u000d\u000a      hullform offers lower resistance\u000d\u000a      at high speeds and a wide deck area. Further ship research had a specific\u000d\u000a      focus on exploring naval\u000d\u000a      architectural characteristics of the configuration, such as stability and\u000d\u000a      roll characteristics [1]. The\u000d\u000a      concept was then taken up in the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) with a major\u000d\u000a      design study that\u000d\u000a      involved an extensive programme of experimental and design research\u000d\u000a      centring on a scaled 6-metre\u000d\u000a      trimaran model of a 3,000-tonne destroyer, designed at UCL and tested at\u000d\u000a      the Haslar\u000d\u000a      Towing Tank (see references included in [2]). The results of this\u000d\u000a      experimental research work were\u000d\u000a      considered sufficiently promising for the Defence Evaluation and Research\u000d\u000a      Agency (DERA) to\u000d\u000a      build an ocean-going two-thirds-scale Trimaran Technology Demonstrator.\u000d\u000a      The demonstrator,\u000d\u000a      named Research Vessel Triton, was principally built to de-risk the\u000d\u000a      structural design. However, it\u000d\u000a      was heavily instrumented to provide data on motions and sea-keeping\u000d\u000a      performance too. Ultimately\u000d\u000a      it was critical to the procurement process considering whether the new\u000d\u000a      trimaran configuration could\u000d\u000a      provide better value for money than the conventional monohull for the\u000d\u000a      Royal Navy's Future Surface\u000d\u000a      Combatant.\u000d\u000a    RV Triton was built by Vosper Thornycroft, Southampton, UK in 1998\u000d\u000a      and accepted in 2000 when it\u000d\u000a      commenced an extensive series of trials for design and operational\u000d\u000a      performance, e.g. sea-keeping\u000d\u000a      and helicopter operations. The project included UCL evaluation to compare\u000d\u000a      actual and predicted\u000d\u000a      performance and substantial US Navy involvement such as to monitor\u000d\u000a      structural bending [3]. Also\u000d\u000a      around this period research was undertaken at UCL to explore the\u000d\u000a      challenges of marine\u000d\u000a      engineering the trimaran hullform. High-power propulsion plants are needed\u000d\u000a      for trimarans and\u000d\u000a      whilst these are straightforward to fit into wider-bodied monohulls, the\u000d\u000a      trimaran's narrower\u000d\u000a      centrehull makes installing these a far more challenging issue, if the\u000d\u000a      advantage of increased\u000d\u000a      efficiency offered by the slimmer hullforms is not to be compromised [4].\u000d\u000a    To initially size a trimaran vessel at the start of preliminary design,\u000d\u000a      it is necessary to determine\u000d\u000a      practically all the principal form parameters. Once the form parameters\u000d\u000a      have been obtained the\u000d\u000a      designer can be reasonably confident that the initial default hull\u000d\u000a      parameter values will only need\u000d\u000a      refining beyond the initial sizing. The degree of that commitment differs\u000d\u000a      substantially from monohull\u000d\u000a      vessels, where it is possible to delay full parametric selection because\u000d\u000a      there is a large historical\u000d\u000a      database upon which to draw information. UCL has published a comprehensive\u000d\u000a      description of the\u000d\u000a      preliminary design of a trimaran vessel i.e. the 5000-tonne Trimaran\u000d\u000a      Destroyer, for which the\u000d\u000a      DERA Haslar 6m model tests were conducted [2].\u000d\u000a    Further work in trimaran research was funded through an Office of Naval\u000d\u000a      Research (ONR)\u000d\u000a      initiative. The Atlantic Center for the Innovative Design and Control\u000d\u000a        of Ships (ACCeSS) was\u000d\u000a      founded in 2002 to establish an academic environment where engineering\u000d\u000a      disciplines associated\u000d\u000a      with novel hull design and ship automation could be brought together\u000d\u000a      within the context of the total\u000d\u000a      ship system architecture. The academic partners in ACCeSS (http:\/\/www.stevens.edu\/access)\u000d\u000a      are\u000d\u000a      many USA universities, UCL (the only UK partner) and industry.\u000d\u000a      Importantly, the partners include\u000d\u000a      the Davidson (High Speed Tow Tank) Laboratory and US Naval Academy (Large\u000d\u000a      Tow Tank),\u000d\u000a      Annapolis. The consortium worked with NSWC Carderock on the design,\u000d\u000a      testing and technology\u000d\u000a      development for trimaran hullforms. As part of ACCeSS research activities\u000d\u000a      further research was\u000d\u000a      undertaken on two trimaran models &#8212; one large and one small. Specific\u000d\u000a      areas of research\u000d\u000a      addressed were parametric resonance (the interaction of waves with\u000d\u000a      hullform) and side-hull\u000d\u000a      positioning i.e. the relative location of the smaller sidehulls to the\u000d\u000a      centre hullform. The findings\u000d\u000a      were passed into ONR to support US naval interest in trimarans, which was\u000d\u000a      gathering pace with\u000d\u000a      the building of the littoral combat ship. Collaborative research was\u000d\u000a      carried out in several areas, with\u000d\u000a      UCL primarily involved with trimaran resistance characterisation obtained\u000d\u000a      through experimentation\u000d\u000a      in tow tanks, stability analysis including parametric roll and the\u000d\u000a      development of design tools for\u000d\u000a      comparative analysis [5] and [6].\u000d\u000a    To assist with the work undertaken in the USA, ONR supported sabbaticals\u000d\u000a      (Drs Greig and\u000d\u000a      Bucknall) at the Davidson Laboratory and through an EPSRC award `Trimaran\u000d\u000a      Resistance Studies'\u000d\u000a      for Visiting Researcher at UCL (Prof R.

Within\u000d\u000a      two years of its foundation in 2006, C8S had won several prestigious\u000d\u000a      awards, culminating in its announcement as the national winner of the\u000d\u000a        2008 Shell Springboard competition [a]. Prize money from the latter\u000d\u000a      was used to design and build a pilot-scale plant at a former landfill\u000d\u000a      facility owned by Kent County Council. The closed site was suffering from\u000d\u000a      degradation and associated subsidence and had limited loss in integrity of\u000d\u000a      its clay-capping layer. The pilot plant combusted the landfill gas (mostly\u000d\u000a      methane), normally collected and sent to a flare, to produce a CO2-enriched\u000a      gas stream that was then used to carbonate a variety of wastes, including\u000d\u000a      biomass ash and ash from paper recycling, to manufacture engineering fill\u000d\u000a      to assist in the restoration of the landfill site. Up to 20% carbon\u000d\u000a      dioxide by weight can be captured in these wastes. Trials of the plant\u000d\u000a      over a 6-month period successfully demonstrated that an integrated waste\u000d\u000a      collection and treatment facility could be operated, supplied by the\u000d\u000a      site's own waste gas. [b] The success of this project was such that C8S\u000d\u000a      was invited, together with other low-carbon innovation companies, to No.10\u000d\u000a      Downing Street four days before the start of critical global climate\u000d\u000a      change negotiations in Copenhagen in 2009. At the time, Prime Minister\u000d\u000a      Gordon Brown said: \"Our transition to a low carbon economy will be a key\u000d\u000a      driver of our future economic prosperity. Carbon8 Systems...are at the\u000d\u000a      forefront of this transformation. Their innovation and expertise\u000d\u000a      demonstrates why the UK is one of best places in the world for low carbon\u000d\u000a      business.\" [c] Carbonation is now recognised as a potential option for CO2\u000d\u000a      sequestration by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the\u000d\u000a      world's foremost body advising on climate change science.\u000d\u000a    In 2009\/10 the results of the TSB project were used to optimise the\u000d\u000a      landfill gas pilot plant, which was then showcased in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Kent County Council and the Environment Agency in September 2010 to a\u000d\u000a      group of invited industrialists, including waste management problem\u000d\u000a      holders and waste management solution providers, such as Aylesford Paper,\u000d\u000a      Shell and SITA [d]. This has led to exploratory studies by C8S on other\u000d\u000a      waste forms, such as oil-drill cuttings, and on-going negotiations with\u000d\u000a      waste-to-energy and waste management companies, all of which are at a\u000d\u000a      commercially sensitive stage and cannot be detailed here. However, it is\u000d\u000a      clear that, due to government and EU regulations on the management and\u000d\u000a      disposal of wastes, there is a great deal of interest in C8S's technology\u000d\u000a      as a means of mitigating costs and adding value to waste streams.\u000d\u000a    The success of the landfill gas project allowed C8S to leverage an\u000d\u000a      initial equity investment of &#163;120,000 from high-net-worth individuals, and\u000d\u000a      a second company, Carbon8 Aggregates (C8A), was formed in early 2010\u000d\u000a      to focus on the commercial opportunities arising from the production of\u000d\u000a      aggregates from such wastes. This company went on to build a larger-scale\u000d\u000a      plant at Grundon Waste Management's site in Brandon, Suffolk and\u000d\u000a      successfully produced &#8212; to the manufacturer's specifications &#8212; 500 tonnes\u000d\u000a      of aggregate from MSWI APCrs for use as raw material by Lignacite, a major\u000d\u000a      UK block manufacturer. This led, in turn, to investment in C8A in 2012\u000d\u000a        by Grundon Waste Management, with the sole purpose of commercialising\u000d\u000a        ACT for the treatment of MSWI APCrs [e] This second-round\u000d\u000a      investment, which consisted of cash, in-kind support and a bank guarantee,\u000d\u000a      allowed the construction of the first full-scale commercial plant, which\u000d\u000a      was built at the Lignacite block plant in Suffolk in January 2012. The\u000d\u000a      plant, which employs shift teams of three plus the site manager, was\u000d\u000a      designed to process 18,000 tonnes per year, providing Lignacite with\u000d\u000a      36,000 tonnes of aggregate: processing capacity has since gradually risen\u000d\u000a      to nearly 400 tonnes per month. C8A is currently writing a specification\u000d\u000a      for plants two and three, which are likely to be built within the next six\u000d\u000a      to nine months. The success of the trials and the quality of the product\u000d\u000a      convinced Lignacite to invest into 50% of Carbon8 Aggregates [f].\u000d\u000a    The Environment Agency Modernising Waste Panel confirmed in 2012 that the\u000d\u000a      output from the process meets its End of Waste criteria, which specify\u000d\u000a      when a certain waste ceases to be waste and obtains a status of a product\u000d\u000a      (or a secondary raw material). All companies dealing with waste management\u000d\u000a      are governed under these criteria. For Carbon8 Aggregates, it means that\u000d\u000a      the treated APCRs can be used as an aggregate product, for example in\u000d\u000a      block making. Facilities using this technology are now being developed\u000d\u000a      across the UK, generating a secondary, recycled aggregate &#8212; which is\u000d\u000a      carbon negative &#8212; to replace land- and sea-won materials. Using the\u000d\u000a      carbonated, recycled material allows manufacturers to avoid the tax of\u000d\u000a        &#163;2.00 per tonne levied by the UK government on these natural aggregates\u000d\u000a      whilst making a meaningful contribution to the country's effective and\u000d\u000a        environmentally sound disposal of CO2 waste:\u000d\u000a      blocks produced from the fly ash of waste incinerators encapsulate 14kg of\u000d\u000a      carbon dioxide per tonne.\u000d\u000a    In May 2013, Lignacite launched its \"Carbon Buster\" block, made up of\u000d\u000a        more than 50% recycled material, including the C8A pellets [g]. In\u000d\u000a      the UK Carbon Buster customers, mainly construction companies, gain\u000d\u000a      credits under the environment assessment schemes of BRE Environmental\u000d\u000a      Assessment Method (BREEAM) and the Code for Sustainable Homes for using\u000d\u000a      Carbon Buster blocks, which enables them to construct homes with\u000d\u000a      attractive sustainability ratings. In July 2013 the product won the\u000d\u000a        Best Recycled Product award at the 2013 National Recycling Awards\u000d\u000a      held at the London Hilton in Park Lane [h]. C8S has begun discussions with\u000d\u000a      a number of companies in Australia to market ACT in Australasia, where a\u000d\u000a      patent applies. The total number of employees of both C8S and C8A\u000d\u000a        currently stands at 11 [i]\u000d\u000a    In addition to the environmental compliance benefits outlined above,\u000d\u000a      their launch of the world's first ever carbon-negative building block\u000d\u000a      brought Lignacite &#8212; as well as C8S and C8A &#8212; positive media coverage from\u000d\u000a      around the world [j]. The C8S and C8A teams' contributions to media\u000d\u000a        discourse about this development not only helped to enhance their\u000d\u000a      own and their commercial partners' standing, but also enhanced\u000d\u000a        awareness of and engagement with important environmental issues relating\u000d\u000a        to the research among an international public audience.\u000d\u000a    The research on APCr has, moreover, had further non-academic impacts\u000d\u000a        on UK policy, leading to the incorporation in 2011 of a\u000d\u000a        recycling option into Defra's guidance on the management of APCr, in\u000d\u000a      relation to the requirement for UK companies to reduce their waste streams\u000d\u000a      as much as possible to meet the EU's Waste Framework Directive [k]. This\u000d\u000a      change has moved APCr up the waste hierarchy, which sets out the various\u000d\u000a      stages to waste minimisation, from recovery of value from wastes to the\u000d\u000a      prevention of the formation of waste in the first place. Recycling is\u000d\u000a      halfway up the hierarchy. Also in 2012, the Environment Agency removed the\u000d\u000a      Waste Acceptance Criteria derogation allowing APCr to go to landfill from\u000d\u000a      around 2015, since they believe that there are now viable alternatives due\u000d\u000a      to the research and development carried out by Simons and C8S. C8S can\u000d\u000a        provide Energy from Waste (EfW) plants with a true zero waste to\u000d\u000a        landfill option, which helps with planning applications. The EfW\u000d\u000a      industry in the UK is currently worth around 6 billion GBP, which is\u000d\u000a      expected to rise to 30 billion GBP in the next 10 years. Hence, C8A has\u000d\u000a      provided a number of letters of support for companies making new planning\u000d\u000a      applications for EfWs.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Carbon8 Systems (C8S) was founded on joint research between UCL and the\u000d\u000a      University of Greenwich. The company has since developed a technology\u000d\u000a      known as Accelerated Carbonation, which helps to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2)\u000d\u000a      emissions by using carbon dioxide gas to treat waste materials and form\u000d\u000a      artificial aggregate. In January 2013, C8S completed the first commercial\u000d\u000a      plant for treating municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) fly ashes,\u000d\u000a      designed to produce 1,000 tonnes per day of aggregate.

It was\u000d\u000a      designed to use \"bottled\" CO2, provided in cylinders in mobile\u000d\u000a      units at land remediation sites. Professor Simons (UCL 1993-present,\u000d\u000a      Professor of Chemical Engineering since 2002), who has expertise in solids\u000d\u000a      handling and particle technology and who founded the Centre for CO2\u000d\u000a      Technology in 1998, was approached by Dr Hills in 2002 and asked to help\u000d\u000a      develop the process design for large-scale operation using flue-gas CO2.\u000d\u000a      Hills and Simons quickly realised the potential to sequester large\u000d\u000a      quantities of CO2 emitted from waste-producing industrial\u000d\u000a      processes via the treatment of the waste using the said emissions.\u000d\u000a      Together with Dr Paula Carey of the Centre for Contaminated Land\u000d\u000a      Remediation at the University of Greenwich, they identified waste streams\u000d\u000a      within the UK that potentially had the right chemical characteristics for\u000d\u000a      treatment by this process. One major source of such waste was the\u000d\u000a      increasing use of incineration to convert municipal solid waste (MSW) into\u000d\u000a      energy, which process leaves behind a hazardous waste residue in the form\u000d\u000a      of fly ash, or Air Pollution Control Residue (APCr). The resulting\u000d\u000a      collaboration led to a major research grant under the Biffaward scheme for\u000d\u000a      the use of ACT in treating municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) APCr\u000d\u000a      [7]. Together with funding from an industrial consortium of waste\u000d\u000a      management and construction aggregate companies, the work at UCL focused\u000d\u000a      on determining the reaction mechanisms involved and the factors governing\u000d\u000a      the reaction kinetics, never before determined and crucial for the design\u000d\u000a      of any processing plant. Factors such as CO2 concentration,\u000d\u000a      water-to-solids ratio, reaction temperature (at atmospheric pressure),\u000d\u000a      particle size distribution and reaction rate were optimised to provide the\u000d\u000a      greatest extent of conversion of cementitious material to the carbonate\u000d\u000a      form [1, 2]. The use of fluidisation as the reactor process was also\u000d\u000a      investigated, although the fine ash particles rendered the system too\u000d\u000a      cohesive [3, 4]. The University of Greenwich focused on the properties of\u000d\u000a      the resulting treated material, in relation to its stability for the\u000d\u000a      purposes of either disposal as a now non-hazardous material in landfill\u000d\u000a      sites, or reuse as a construction aggregate [5].\u000d\u000a    MSWI APCrs were selected as focus for this research since they represent\u000d\u000a      a growing disposal problem in the UK and Europe, where the amount of MSW\u000d\u000a      diverted from landfill and sent to incinerators continues to grow\u000d\u000a      exponentially. The research at UCL and University of Greenwich established\u000d\u000a      ACT as an effective treatment method for APCrs, rendering the ashes\u000d\u000a      non-hazardous and stable over long time periods. However, up until 2002,\u000d\u000a      it was believed that high concentrations (i.e. 100%) of CO2\u000d\u000a      were required to drive the carbonation reactions to a rapid conclusion;\u000d\u000a      that is, to conclusion in under 15 minutes, rather than the days and\u000d\u000a      months required for naturally occurring carbonation reactions slowed by\u000d\u000a      the low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Simons' work at\u000d\u000a      UCL revealed that this was not, in fact, the case, and that the optimum\u000d\u000a      conditions for rapid &#8212; but almost complete &#8212; reaction depended not only on\u000d\u000a      the concentration of the gas, but on the particle size of the waste being\u000d\u000a      treated, as well as the water-to-solid ratio. As such, the optimum gas\u000d\u000a      concentration was shown to be ~30%, more aligned to the concentrations\u000d\u000a      found in typical coal-fired power station flues [6]. This crucial\u000d\u000a      discovery provided the basis for the design of a continuous process using\u000d\u000a      flue gas streams (further developed using prize money (see below) and\u000d\u000a      funding from the TSB [8]) and subsequent establishment of Carbon8 Systems.\u000d\u000a      Founded in 2006 by Simons, Hills and Carey, Carbon8 Systems was set up to\u000d\u000a      commercialise ACT as a waste treatment and CO2 capture process.\u000d\u000a      Simons is currently a non-executive director of the company.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32741","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Through adoption of new technologies, UCL's research into USD\u000d\u000a      technologies has led to commercial benefits for companies developing new\u000d\u000a      drugs by reducing the time to take new products to manufacture, with\u000a        ensuing cost savings.

One USD collaborator comments, \"A\u000d\u000a      key feature of USD technologies is their role in helping\u000a          biopharmaceutical companies to deliver a Quality by Design agenda\u000d\u000a      via the early quantification of Critical Processing Parameters which\u000d\u000a        determine Critical Product Attributes, eg the early indication of the\u000d\u000a        impacts of process shear stress on the process streams involved in the\u000d\u000a        Protherics studies. The FDA Quality by Design agenda is already valued\u000d\u000a        at more than US$20bn to the overall biopharmaceuticals sector eg through\u000d\u000a        a 25% reduction in time to market and delivery of more robust\u000d\u000a        processes.\" [d]\u000d\u000a    Next generation products developed by industry: One major impact\u000d\u000a      has been via collaborative programmes focused on technology transfer into\u000d\u000a      new sectors such as next generation recombinant vaccines. Over &#163;1m of\u000d\u000a      industrial funding has been gained to support studies in the supply of\u000d\u000a      novel vaccines and the use of USD to devise de novo bioprocesses eg in\u000d\u000a      2010-2011 for novel fusion proteins with ImmunoBiology, which the company\u000d\u000a      described as \"extremely valuable\" for its business activities [f]. In the\u000d\u000a      period 2004-2008 BioVex, a UK biotechnology discovery company, were able\u000d\u000a      to use USD to investigate the processing of a major vaccine candidate\u000d\u000a      therapy, a Herpes Simplex virus engineered to kill cancer cells\u000d\u000a      specifically. This understanding of the manufacturability of the virus\u000d\u000a      product enabled BioVex to demonstrate and ultimately realise the value of\u000d\u000a      their product through an up to US$1bn acquisition in 2011 by the US\u000d\u000a        company Amgen.[g].\u000d\u000a    A second key emerging industrial sector has been the provision of\u000d\u000a        human cells for therapy via the development of USD technologies for\u000d\u000a      whole bioprocess design. A &#163;1.8m company-TSB programme (2007-11) allowed\u000d\u000a      UCL to explore the role of USD in speeding the development of allogeneic\u000d\u000a      cell-based therapies. For example, for one of the partners, ReNeuron, the\u000d\u000a      Chief Scientific Officer observed how USD tools helped them \"identify\u000d\u000a        ways in which robustness and acceptable yields may be retained,\" and\u000d\u000a      that \"The increased insight and understanding helps enhance\u000d\u000a          the quality of process information to be used by the\u000d\u000a        Contract Manufacturing Organisation (CMO) to inform scale up and also to\u000d\u000a      help inform regulatory bodies with respect to meeting Quality by\u000d\u000a          Design standards.\" [h]\u000d\u000a    Creation of spin-out company: USD studies were an essential\u000d\u000a      research technique in the development of novel adsorbent materials for\u000d\u000a      bioprocessing, which UCL filed as a patent in 2013. A UCL start-up,\u000d\u000a      Puridify, was established in 2013 to develop the new technology, which\u000d\u000a      offers a ten-fold increase in purification productivity over existing\u000d\u000a        reagents, with a lower lifetime cost. This will broaden\u000d\u000a      patient access to drugs through reducing prices.

Such regimes are then reproduced using\u000d\u000a      millilitre-scale devices so that it is possible, using just small\u000d\u000a      quantities of precious material available at early stages of new product\u000d\u000a      development, to predict full-scale manufacturing performance.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research focused on the characterisation of the\u000d\u000a      effects of process stress on biomaterials. This was based on original\u000d\u000a      fundamental research into the concept of critical regime analysis [1].\u000d\u000a      Success was achieved in the creation of mimics of intricate high-stress\u000d\u000a      centrifuge feed zones. These provided new insights into the effects on,\u000d\u000a      for example, mammalian cells [2] and polymer-flocculated cell debris [3].\u000d\u000a      Rigorous engineering characterisation was used with predictive models to\u000d\u000a      verify hypotheses of how biological structures are affected during\u000d\u000a      processing, e.g. for high acceleration centrifuge feed zones [2] and for\u000d\u000a      high impact centrifuge discharge zones [4, 5].\u000d\u000a    The research advanced understanding of how mechanical, hydrodynamic and\u000d\u000a      impact stresses that exist during flow in the complex geometries found in\u000d\u000a      manufacturing-scale equipment can affect the structure of delicate\u000d\u000a      biological materials. In this way, such materials, including\u000d\u000a      macromolecules and structured aggregates for biopharmaceuticals and\u000d\u000a      vaccines, and whole cells for therapy, can be characterised in terms of\u000d\u000a      their response to process engineering environments. The potency of USD\u000d\u000a      technology is the ability to address whole bioprocesses and characterise\u000d\u000a      key interactions between process stages. Key research findings\u000d\u000a      have included an understanding of how the preparation of the material can\u000d\u000a      affect its response to process stress, and how the material and process\u000d\u000a      environment can be modified to avoid deleterious effects, for example for\u000d\u000a      antibodies [5] and for human cells with defined surface markers for\u000d\u000a      therapy [6].\u000d\u000a    This research has led to subsequent successes, for example the\u000d\u000a      characterisation of the impact of cell age on robustness to stress and the\u000d\u000a      nature of antibody therapies formed [7], along with the design of\u000d\u000a      processes for the recovery of a next generation fusion protein vaccine\u000d\u000a      candidate [8]. UCL's USD technology has provided the first rigorous\u000d\u000a      engineering basis for whole bioprocess design for such materials.\u000d\u000a    The research outputs were achieved between 2000 and 2013, particularly\u000d\u000a      through a managed EPSRC Innovative Manufacturing Research Centre (IMRC)\u000d\u000a      programme in bioprocessing from 2002-2007, which was hosted and led by UCL\u000d\u000a      Biochemical Engineering in collaboration with over 40 leading industrial\u000d\u000a      research groups in the biopharmaceutical sector. This programmes focused\u000d\u000a      on developing new fundamentals and applications of USD technologies and\u000d\u000a      increasing the value base for continuing exploitation. Such collaborations\u000d\u000a      allowed fundamental research with high-performance industrial strains and\u000d\u000a      next generation therapies, and enabled access to industrial-scale\u000d\u000a      manufacturing facilities for verifying USD predictions. This programme\u000d\u000a      successfully created the USD concept from engineering fundamentals to a\u000d\u000a      practical technology for application in the bioprocessing industries\u000d\u000a      especially for macromolecular bioprocessing. The outputs of the research\u000d\u000a      were reviewed four times by the EPSRC, with the 2005 international review\u000d\u000a      and panel visit (York, Cabral, Middelberg) also commenting on industrial\u000d\u000a      impact, eg: \"The programme appears to be well designed to achieve its\u000d\u000a        aim of changing the way bioprocesses are designed and optimized in the\u000d\u000a        future. It is already achieving real benefits for its industrial\u000d\u000a        partners\".

By making investment in technology now, it will ensure that in\u000a        ten years' time the UK is at the forefront of the global race when it\u000a        comes to commercialising new technologies\" [b].\u000a    Economic benefits in terms of new products and cost and time\u000a          savings: Since 2008, many of the new bioprocess tools\u000a      developed as part of the research described above have been adopted by\u000a      consortium companies for their industrial biocatalytic processes. Examples\u000a      of the impact of these technologies include:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aCommercialisation of a miniature stirred bioreactor technology.\u000a        The UCL design for a novel miniature stirred bioreactor technology\u000a        enabling direct scale-up from 30 mL to 10L was commercialised via HEL\u000a        Ltd and has been on the market since 2008. The miniature bioreactor\u000a        enables rapid testing of new fermentation applications with data\u000a        gathering that fully matches the large scale. This saves time and cost\u000a        in avoiding running large-scale fermentations while testing a\u000a        fermentation protocol. These miniature bioreactors (30-500 mL)\u000a        represented a new product line for the company [c] [text removed for\u000a        publication].\u000a      \u000aIndustrial adoption of high throughput bioprocess design\u000a          methodologies. A number of BiCE programme industrial partners have\u000a        now adopted UCL high-throughput and microscale technologies to help\u000a        speed the design of new biocatalytic processes. These include Lonza,\u000a        Merck &amp; Co, Evonik and DSM. As an indication of the impact achieved\u000a        the Executive Director of BioProcess Technology &amp; Expression from\u000a        Merck &amp; Co has reported a 3-to-5-fold throughput improvement\u000a            by the application of microscale-based techniques. This\u000a        accelerated the pipeline in multiple ways including: shortening the\u000a        duration from catalyst screen to delivery of mg quantities of initial\u000a        material by 70%, thereby enabling a 3-fold increase in the number of\u000a        projects that can be handled by a single scientist and widening of the\u000a        catalyst library that can be rapidly screened by 3 to 5 times [d]. This\u000a        enables them to complete customer projects in a shorter time or with the\u000a        commitment of fewer FTEs due to the parallel nature of the HEL miniature\u000a        bioreactor systems. In addition UCL staff are now providing consultancy\u000a        services to additional companies on how to implement these\u000a        methodologies.\u000a    \u000a    Economic benefits from screening and utilisation of BiCE enzyme\u000a          libraries: Libraries of engineered enzymes have been provided\u000a      to company partners for use in their internal high-throughput screening\u000a      programmes. Licensing of these libraries saves each company the time and\u000a      costs involved in in-house library generation e.g. for a company to\u000a      construct and validate an enzyme library containing tens to hundreds of\u000a      mutants, rather than using UCL's libraries, might demand full-time\u000a      commitment of 2 FTE for 6 months. For example, Almac has used over 100 of\u000a      these enzymes to identify transaminases that are able to catalyse\u000a      amination of the substrates Almac uses in its in-house drug discovery\u000a      programmes and for customer contracts. In 2010 Almac identified one TAm\u000a      variant that catalyses amine formation on a compound for a pharmaceutical\u000a      company customer. They are now scaling up production of this TAm ready for\u000a      commercial-scale utilisation. The head of biocatalysis at Almac said: \"The\u000a        new enzyme process is one third of the cost of the chemical\u000a          process and the yield of the process has\u000a          increased from 10% to over 90%\" [e]. Since then, Almac\u000a      and UCL have had a royalty-sharing agreement for the commercial\u000a      exploitation of this and the other transaminases. In a similar vein,\u000a      Sigma-Aldrich has since 2006 used one of the BiCE TK variants for\u000a      commercial preparation of D-xylulose-5-phosphate and a TAm variant to\u000a      prepare pyridoxamine-5-phosphate. The Head of Research Specialities from\u000a      Sigma-Aldrich (SIAL) notes that \"The direct comparison of selective\u000a        one-step enzymic reactions to chemical routes of synthesis show the\u000a        advantage of replacing non-selective chemical routes, which then involve\u000a        also significant purification efforts after the reaction(s). The\u000a        beneficial effect on safety, health and environment improvement by the\u000a        enzymatic route fits well with the current sustainability goals at\u000a        Sigma-Aldrich.\" [f]\u000a    Environmental benefits arising from adoption of biocatalysis:\u000a      It is widely recognised in the chemical industry that biocatalysis\u000a      generates environmental benefits when used to replace chemical approaches\u000a      that require multiple steps and the use of protection\/deprotection\u000a      reagents. Industrial adoption of BiCE enzyme variants for commercial\u000a      production of chemicals and pharmaceutical intermediates, as described\u000a      above, has major environmental benefits. For example, Almac's head of\u000a      biocatalysis noted: \"Recent success using a BiCE transaminase enzyme\u000a        has resulted in the removal of 8 steps of chemistry using a transaminase\u000a        enzyme from the BiCE project. As you can imagine this has a major input\u000a        into cost of goods by lowering reagent and energy usage and very\u000a        importantly, waste production\" [f]. Likewise, SIAL has obtained\u000a      similar benefits since 2008 through exploitation of a BiCE TK enzyme for\u000a      the synthesis of xylulose-5-phosphate and a transaminase single step route\u000a      to pyridoxamine-5`-phosphate, both metabolic intermediates useful for\u000a      research purposes. These enzyme processes replace multiple chemical steps\u000a      in the synthesis of these products, with the benefit that no costly and\u000a      hard-to-dispose-of organic solvents need to be used [f].\u000a    New job creation: The establishment of Synthace in 2011 and\u000a      its subsequent success in raising investment funding has led directly to\u000a      the creation of 7 new jobs [b]. Likewise, Almac's association with UCL and\u000a      adoption of our advanced biocatalyst technologies \"has resulted in\u000a        significant growth of biocatalysis research at Almac including increased\u000a        staff numbers\" [f]. In a new business plan finalised in July 2013\u000a      HEL Ltd committed to the creation of 4 new jobs to support their growing\u000a      miniature stirred bioreactor product line [d].\u000a    Knowledge transfer to the wider industrial community: The\u000a      wider uptake of BiCE programme outputs has also been achieved through\u000a      incorporation of BiCE-related material in a number of the industrial\u000a      modules contributing to the UCL MBI&#174; Training\u000a        Programme. Modules using this material include Rapid Fermentation\u000a      Process Development, Design of Experiments for Bioprocess Optimisation and\u000a      Industrial Biocatalysis and Biorefining. These modules have been attended\u000a      by 157 industrial delegates from over 50 companies since 2008, with\u000a      several customers having used multiple courses throughout the five-year\u000a      period covered.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    UCL research has been instrumental in creating critically needed new\u000a      biocatalysts and bioprocess technologies for industrial biocatalytic\u000a      process development. These have impact across the UK chemical and\u000a      pharmaceutical sectors. BiCE enzyme technologies have been exploited\u000a      through the formation of a spin-out company, Synthace, generating\u000a      investment of &#163;1.8m and creation of 7 new jobs.

This combined aspects of synthetic chemistry, molecular biology\u000a      and process engineering to generate novel biocatalysts with increased\u000a      productivity for application in the chemical and pharmaceutical\u000a      industries. The programme also established a range of technologies to\u000a      facilitate the rapid design and scale-up of green, more environmentally\u000a      friendly, industrial biocatalytic processes. This new approach was shared\u000a      with 13 industrial partners, enabling the early identification of all\u000a      potential bottlenecks for efficient biocatalytic process development, from\u000a      biocatalyst discovery through to process design and scale-up.\u000a    The underpinning research delivered a range of tools for synthetic\u000a      biology, enzyme engineering and biocatalyst screening, as well as new\u000a      enzyme variants and E. coli strains, enabling synthesis of\u000a      important pharmaceutical intermediates (chiral ketodiols and aminodiols).\u000a      Building on work from 2000 to 2003, which resulted in patents [8], the\u000a      BiCE programme used this technology to engineer enzyme variants now used\u000a      by the programme's company partners. Automated, high-throughput methods\u000a      for biocatalyst process evaluation were also developed, along with novel\u000a      miniature stirred bioreactor technologies that help facilitate the rapid\u000a      establishment of scalable biocatalytic and chemo-enzymatic synthetic\u000a      routes.\u000a    Over 70% of pharmaceutical compounds contain amine functionalities and\u000a      many biologically active natural products contain chiral amino alcohols.\u000a      While chemical methods exist for their asymmetric synthesis, these are\u000a      generally step intensive or consume expensive and frequently toxic\u000a      catalysts or chiral auxilliaries. The underpinning BiCE research addressed\u000a      key bottlenecks in the development of novel, industrially useful\u000a      biocatalytic processes for the synthesis of amino alcohols. First,\u000a      researchers constructed a completely de novo metabolic pathway\u000a      consisting of transketolase (TK) and transaminase (TAm) in E.coli,\u000a      using a novel mix-and-match plasmid technology, to produce the chiral\u000a      aminodiol 2-amino-1,3,4-butanetriol [1]. To diversify this pathway and\u000a      access a broader range of substrates and useful aminodiol products, over\u000a      100 new transaminases, including the versatile omega-transaminases, were\u000a      identified from a range of organisms by metagenomics. These were then\u000a      isolated, cloned into E.coli, and screened for broadened substrate\u000a      selectivity and increased activity [2]. In parallel, novel targeted\u000a      directed evolution strategies were invented using phylogenetic and\u000a      structural information to engineer TK mutants capable of processing a\u000a      range of new substrates including aliphatic and cyclic aldehydes [3], and\u000a      to have improved product enantioselectivities. Next, automated\u000a      high-throughput and process modelling approaches were created [4] and\u000a      researchers designed a miniature and parallel stirred bioreactor system\u000a      that is predictive of larger-scale bioreactor performance [5].\u000a      Underpinning all this work was development of a suite of novel automated\u000a      high-throughput assays for quantification of TK activity and stability\u000a      [6]. Finally, complete integration of all the BiCE component elements was\u000a      demonstrated and published [7]. This utilised all the BiCE technologies to\u000a      rapidly establish a preparative scale, two-step process suitable for\u000a      manufacture of 2S-amino-1,3S-pentanediol on an industrial scale.\u000a    The BiCE programme brought together a multi-disciplinary team of staff.\u000a      The project was managed initially by Prof John Woodley (Biochemical\u000a      Engineering) and then by Prof Gary Lye (Biochemical Engineering). Key\u000a      research was led by Prof Paul Dalby (Biochemical Engineering), Prof John\u000a      Ward (Structural and Molecular Biology, who joined Biochemical Engineering\u000a      in 2012), Prof Helen Hailes (Chemistry) and Dr Frank Baganz (Biochemical\u000a      Engineering). The project involved 6 Research Associates (RAs) and 5\u000a      associated doctoral students. Of the RAs Dr Martina Micheletti\u000a      (Biochemical Engineering) joined the UCL staff in 2007 while the other RAs\u000a      all progressed to industrial careers.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37236","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, major turbomachinery manufacturers have adopted ADT's\u000d\u000a      TURBOdesign&#8482; software suite in ever increasing numbers, as they sought to\u000d\u000a      achieve improvements in their design processes and manufacturing methods,\u000d\u000a      and thus unlock benefits such as increased efficiency of their\u000d\u000a      turbo-machinery and reductions in CO2 emissions.

In another article in Machine Design,\u000d\u000a      Mr Toru Iwata of Daikin Industries said: \"The software helped us reduce\u000d\u000a        development time and slash material use, as well as develop new models\u000d\u000a        of high-efficiency fans\" [e].\u000d\u000a    Enabling improvements in manufacturing methods in the\u000d\u000a          turbomachinery industry: In the turbomachinery industry\u000d\u000a      various methods are used for manufacturing the vanes and blades. For low\u000d\u000a      volume vane and blade manufacture within aerospace applications, it is\u000d\u000a      usual that CNC machines are utilised. For high-volume applications, such\u000d\u000a      as turbochargers, it is customary to use casting or in some cases a flank\u000d\u000a      milling process for blades with straight filaments, as these approaches\u000d\u000a      result in lower manufacturing costs.\u000d\u000a    In 2011, Cummins Turbo Technology, one of the leading manufacturers of\u000d\u000a      heavy-duty diesel turbochargers globally, decided to take into high-volume\u000d\u000a      production a turbocharger compressor with 3D blades. This was designed\u000d\u000a      using the 3D inverse design method TURBOdesign&#8482; and machined by using a\u000d\u000a      5-axis point milling process. The point milling process can add between\u000d\u000a      15-20 per cent to manufacturing costs compared to flank milling or\u000d\u000a      casting. The main impetus for the company to make such a substantial\u000d\u000a      change in its manufacturing process was the fact that for 10 years they\u000d\u000a      had not been able to make any improvement in the performance of a baseline\u000d\u000a      turbocharger compressor, which had straight filaments, with direct design\u000d\u000a      methods. By using the inverse design approach an impeller could be\u000d\u000a      designed that was up to 3 points more efficient through most of the\u000d\u000a      compressor map. However, this impeller had a 3D geometry and required a\u000d\u000a      significant change in manufacturing process. The significant improvement\u000d\u000a      in performance of the new compressor, in the eyes of Cummins Turbo and its\u000d\u000a      major engine manufacturers, more than justified the additional costs\u000d\u000a      associated with the changes to manufacturing method [f].\u000d\u000a    The TURBODesign&#8482; software makes it easier to design 3D blade and vane\u000d\u000a      geometries with high efficiency, and with the current rate of reduction in\u000d\u000a      the cost of the point milling process it can create important\u000d\u000a      possibilities for further improvement in turbomachinery component\u000d\u000a      efficiencies.\u000d\u000a    Increased turbomachinery efficiency and reduction of CO2\u000d\u000a          emissions: One of the major impacts of industry's adoption of\u000d\u000a      ADT's inverse design method is a significant improvement in the efficiency\u000d\u000a      of turbomachinery. Earlier research had shown that breakthrough designs\u000d\u000a      made possible by this approach can lead to significant improvements in\u000d\u000a      pump stage efficiency of up to 6 points (see outputs [5] and [6], above).\u000d\u000a      Similar levels of performance improvement are being achieved by industrial\u000d\u000a      use of the inverse design method. For example, in 2013, Daikin Industries\u000d\u000a      confirmed that they had improved the efficiency of an air-conditioning fan\u000d\u000a      by 10% by using the inverse design method [e].\u000d\u000a    Likewise, performance improvements have been achieved in other industries\u000d\u000a      such as pumps, automotive and power generation through the adoption of\u000d\u000a      this technology. For example in 2008, RR Marine, a major manufacturer of\u000d\u000a      large-scale marine waterjets, was able to improve the propulsive\u000d\u000a      efficiency of their marine waterjets by 3-5% by using ADT's software\u000d\u000a      TURBOdesign&#8482; [g]. Furthermore, they obtained a significant reduction in\u000d\u000a      manufacturing cost of their waterjets, which came on the market in 2013\u000d\u000a      [g].\u000d\u000a    These efficiency savings have consequent environmental benefits by\u000d\u000a      reducing CO2 emissions. ebm papst has been using the inverse\u000d\u000a      design method since 2006, and claimed in a 2008 advert in The Economist\u000d\u000a      magazine that \"If for ventilation, refrigeration and airconditioning,\u000d\u000a        European industry switches to the latest generation of fans (designed by\u000d\u000a        ebm-papst), 16 Million tons of CO2 emission\u000d\u000a        will be cut and 4 coal fired power stations will be made redundant\"\u000d\u000a      [h].\u000d\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The development of a novel 3D inverse design method for turbomachinery\u000d\u000a      aerodynamic design at UCL has led to important design breakthroughs for\u000d\u000a      pump and compressor applications. The resulting IP and software has been\u000d\u000a      commercialised by a UCL spinout company Advanced Design Technology Ltd\u000d\u000a      (ADT), which is now considered a global leader in advanced turbomachinery\u000d\u000a      design software. Since 2008, the 3D inverse design codes embedded within\u000d\u000a      ADT's TURBOdesign&#8482; suite of software have been adopted by many of the\u000d\u000a      leading turbomachinery equipment manufacturers in Europe, Japan and the\u000d\u000a      US.

The direct design approach is based on trial and error\u000d\u000a      iteration of the blade or vane geometry by the designer, using feedback\u000d\u000a      from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code. This approach inherently\u000d\u000a      results in a reduction of the design space as designers tend to operate\u000d\u000a      within their comfort zone. Using this approach makes it more difficult to\u000d\u000a      achieve designs beyond the designer's previous experience and is also\u000d\u000a      time-consuming. The result is significant constraints on the ability of\u000d\u000a      companies to achieve further improvements in the performance of their\u000d\u000a      turbomachinery. By contrast, in the inverse design approach, the blade or\u000d\u000a      vane geometry is designed for a given specified distribution of pressure\u000d\u000a      or blade loading. The 3D pressure distribution controls the viscous\u000d\u000a      behaviour of the flow; by controlling the 3D pressure field it is possible\u000d\u000a      to directly use the detailed information provided by CFD solutions to\u000d\u000a      arrive at a choice of optimum loading to control particular sources of\u000d\u000a      loss in turbomachines. By removing the need for empiricism in the design\u000d\u000a      process, the inverse design approach allows designers to directly use\u000d\u000a      their knowledge of detailed fluid dynamics, as provided by CFD and\u000d\u000a      detailed measurements, to arrive at a breakthrough solutions that solve\u000d\u000a      particular adverse flow phenomena.\u000d\u000a    The inverse design approach had previously been used extensively in two\u000d\u000a      dimensions by the aeroengine industry but no robust design methods existed\u000d\u000a      in three dimensions. To address this gap, the research group headed by\u000d\u000a      Professor Mehrdad Zangeneh (Professor of Thermofluids, at UCL since 1989)\u000d\u000a      in UCL's Department of Mechanical Engineering started working on the\u000d\u000a      development of novel 3D inverse design methods in the early 1990s. One of\u000d\u000a      the key aspects of previous inverse design methods was that they mainly\u000d\u000a      relied on the specification of blade surface pressure on suction and\u000d\u000a      pressure surfaces. This removed the designer's control of blade thickness,\u000d\u000a      which is a very important parameter for high-speed applications.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, the compatibility conditions in three dimensions make it\u000d\u000a      difficult to know the correct feasible spanwise static pressure\u000d\u000a      distribution on the blade a priori, as spanwise variations in\u000d\u000a      pressure are influenced by the streamwise flow distribution. This meant\u000d\u000a      that development or extension of any inverse method in 3D had limited\u000d\u000a      success. A key innovation arising from the UCL research was the use of\u000d\u000a      blade loading within the design methodology. When coupled with pressure\u000d\u000a      jump across the blade and blade thickness, it was possible to achieve a\u000d\u000a      significantly more robust 3D inverse design method and this allowed some\u000d\u000a      of the important outstanding problems in turbomachinery aerodynamics to be\u000d\u000a      solved [1][2]. The design code was subsequently extended to marine ducted\u000d\u000a      propulsors as a result of a $700k research grant from the US Office of\u000d\u000a      Naval Research [3] and extended to include coupling with automatic\u000d\u000a      optimisation for multi-point\/multi-objective design [4]. UCL's application\u000d\u000a      of 3D inverse design methods to various applications, especially in radial\u000d\u000a      turbomachinery, resulted in important breakthroughs in design and led to\u000d\u000a      the university filing a number of international patents [8].\u000d\u000a    One of the first applications of the 3D inverse design method was in\u000d\u000a      centrifugal compressors and pumps. The main aim was to reduce or eliminate\u000d\u000a      secondary flows in the impeller, which result in significant flow\u000d\u000a      non-uniformity (jet\/wake flow) and hence are a major cause of loss in\u000d\u000a      impellers. The nature of secondary flows and what causes them was quite\u000d\u000a      well understood, but with conventional (or direct) design based on\u000d\u000a      iterative changes to geometry it was rather difficult to arrive at a\u000d\u000a      design that helped to reduce or minimise secondary flows. By using the 3D\u000d\u000a      inverse design method, UCL researchers could establish a systematic\u000d\u000a      approach for minimising secondary flows in centrifugal impellers. The\u000d\u000a      control of secondary flows actually led to significant improvements to\u000d\u000a      compressor\/pump stage efficiency [5 and patents i and iii]. Other\u000d\u000a      breakthroughs were related to control of 3D corner separation in pump\u000d\u000a      diffusers [6 and patents iv, v and vi]. Further important breakthroughs\u000d\u000a      were obtained in cavitation in pumps [7] and shockwave losses in transonic\u000d\u000a      axial fans [2].\u000d\u000a    The research was subsequently commercialised through the formation of a\u000d\u000a      UCL spinout company, Advanced Design Technology (ADT), which was\u000d\u000a      established as a joint venture with the major Japanese turbomachinery\u000d\u000a      manufacturer, Ebara Corporation, in 1998.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38368","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The data from catalyst aging tests are required in the commercialisation\u000d\u000a      of any new formulation in the automotive industry.

The realisation that exhaust gas recirculation could be\u000d\u000a      applied to improve such issues was a significant advance and led to the\u000d\u000a      development of the patented dynamic Catalyst Ageing System.

Catagen delivered the first machine to Fiat CRF, Italy\u000d\u000a      in June 2012 and, at that time, quotations were sent to 6 automotive\u000d\u000a      companies.

This\u000d\u000a      is backed up by former Director of Ford Motors in the USA (Rose\u000d\u000a      Mary Stalker) who stated \"The automotive industry is built on innovation\u000d\u000a      and Labcat is a significant and welcome development ... it\u000d\u000a          will find international success\". Rose Mary Stalker's strong\u000d\u000a      belief in Catagen resulted in her accepting the position of its Chair in\u000d\u000a      January 2013.\u000d\u000a    That international success is now being demonstrated with global sales to\u000d\u000a        Fiat and General Motors Company (both iconic names and world\u000d\u000a      leaders in motoring) and a new major deal with Mahle Powertrain, the\u000d\u000a      second largest company in the world producing engine components. As well\u000d\u000a      as bringing economic rewards to Catagen this has been acknowledged by the\u000d\u000a      Best High Growth Company Award at InterTradeIreland's 2012 all-island\u000d\u000a        Seedcorn Business Competition.\u000d\u000a    The global market size is estimated at 15,000 test machines (just\u000d\u000a      within the automotive sector) translating to a required production\u000d\u000a      capacity of 150 machines per year (current Catagen capacity is 4 machines\u000d\u000a      per year). Further markets will be coming on-stream, such as small\u000d\u000a      off-road engines (SORE), which will require catalysts. This will occur\u000d\u000a      over the next 10 years due to the introduction of new emissions\u000d\u000a      legislation.

Initial research focused on catalytic converters\u000d\u000a      for two-stroke engines and addressed the catalytic substrate simply as an\u000d\u000a      obstruction to the flow of exhaust gas, which hinders the progression of\u000d\u000a      the main exhausted pulse, and in turn affects the performance of the\u000d\u000a      engine [1]. This initial research led to a validated catalyst model for\u000d\u000a      two-stroke applications that involved Douglas and McCullough [2].\u000d\u000a    A natural progression of the research was to understand the catalysis\u000d\u000a      processes themselves, research driven by the automotive industry, which\u000d\u000a      was coming under increasing pressure to reduce and monitor engine\u000d\u000a      emissions. This work addressed the reaction rates associated with the\u000d\u000a      storage process, for three-way automotive catalysts [3] and highlighted\u000d\u000a      the need for precise understanding of the ageing process in catalysts.\u000d\u000a      Ageing, in this context, refers to the fact that catalysts do not operate\u000d\u000a      with the same efficiency over long periods (years in terms of required\u000d\u000a      life-times in cars). Therefore test methods must be able to demonstrate\u000d\u000a      that new designs will operate effectively (i.e. within engine emission\u000d\u000a      targets) over sustained periods.\u000d\u000a    Later work by Douglas and McCullough describes a detailed mathematical\u000d\u000a      model for oxygen storage, a crucial part of a complete kinetic model of a\u000d\u000a      three-way automotive catalyst. This model consisted of two interdependent\u000d\u000a      sub-models with the complex environment of a catalyst: one for the\u000d\u000a      oxidation process and a second for the reduction process. In this study, O2\u000d\u000a      and NO were used as oxidizing agents and CO, C3H6\u000d\u000a      and C3H8 were used as reducing agents [4].\u000d\u000a    The development of the new dynamic Catalyst Ageing System\u000d\u000a      for testing motor vehicle catalysts dates back to the formation of\u000d\u000a      CenTACat in 2003 [6]. CenTACat undertakes multidisciplinary research\u000d\u000a      involving chemists, physicists and engineers with a common interest in\u000d\u000a      understanding the fundamental principles that underpin clean energy\u000d\u000a      production and environmental protection.

Armstrong (CA) and Prof. R. Crawford (RC) were involved\u000d\u000a      in prestigious EPSRC funded research into the feasibility of\u000d\u000a      modelling the stretch blow moulding process. [G1]. This research continued\u000d\u000a      in 1996 with a 4 year project sponsored by InvestNI, Coca Cola and\u000d\u000a        Boxmore Plastics. Both of these projects focused on the development\u000d\u000a      of a stretch blow moulding (SBM) manufacturing simulation with the aim\u000d\u000a        of removing the trial and error techniques from the process. From\u000d\u000a      this research a material model capable of modelling the nonlinear\u000d\u000a      viscoelastic material behaviour of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at\u000d\u000a      strain and thermal histories appropriate to SBM was implemented within a\u000d\u000a      SBM simulation [P1]. A major output of this project was the development of\u000d\u000a      a biaxial testing machine capable of duplicating the deformation behaviour\u000d\u000a      of the SBM process [P2]. The machine enabled an appropriate dataset to be\u000d\u000a      created and a corresponding mathematical model to capture the behaviour of\u000d\u000a      PET and has since attracted interest from a host of multinational\u000d\u000a        companies [text removed for publication].

An aspect of\u000d\u000a      this work corresponding to characterising of PET for SBM is highlighted in\u000d\u000a      [P4]. The paper was the first to present a comprehensive set of\u000d\u000a      experimental data suitable for modelling the behaviour of PET for SBM and\u000d\u000a      led to collaboration with University of Paris Est.\u000d\u000a    Between 2005-2008, an EU FP6 project led by GM, CA and EHJ [G3],\u000d\u000a      resulted in the development of wireless instrumentation capable of\u000d\u000a        recording process conditions on industrial machines [P5].

QUB technology is now being\u000a        utilised to reduce this pollution.\u000a    Wrightbus is the UK's largest bus manufacturer producing a range of\u000a        buses which it now exports globally. Wrightbus used the models and\u000a      capability arising from this QUB research to improve their range of hybrid\u000a      buses, resulting in contracts of more than &#163;230M for 600 buses and\u000a        growth in the company to a workforce of over 1400 high value\u000a        manufacturing jobs. Most notably the work helped Wrightbus secure\u000a      the contract to replace the iconic Routemaster for Transport for London.\u000a      In tests at Millbrook Proving Ground, the engineering test vehicle emitted\u000a      only 640 grams per kilometre (g\/km) of CO2 and 3.96 g\/km of\u000a      Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) &#8212; less than half of the CO2\u000a      emitted by a current diesel bus (1295g\/km) and under half of the NOx\u000a      emitted by a current diesel bus (9.3g\/km). In testing, fuel economy\u000a        was also better than twice that of a standard diesel bus at 11.6mpg.\u000a    \u000a\u0009\u000a\u0009\u000a    The hybrid bus model is a simulation of the complete vehicle which allows\u000a      designers to assess the performance of the bus (power and fuel usage) over\u000a      the whole drive cycle in a city, with its numerous stops, starts,\u000a      accelerations and decelerations. It was developed with the express aim of\u000a      assisting in the design of hybrid drivelines for city buses, to specify\u000a      components and to optimise control strategies. The model has almost 50\u000a      person years of research embedded within based on extensive theoretical\u000a      work and experimental validation. The pivotal capability is that the model\u000a      works reliability over the whole drive cycle allowing designers to tune\u000a      engine and powertrain performance at all points.\u000a    This was directly introduced to Wrightbus, Ballymena initially through\u000a        a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP, commenced 2010) to implement\u000a      the model into their design process for new hybrid buses. It is now routinely\u000a        used by their engineers for specification of hybrid buses and has been\u000a        applied in a series of projects. It is accepted as an important\u000a      design tool and has been well validated for accurate prediction of fuel\u000a      economy and emissions of the Wrightbus product range. This key capability\u000a      allowed partner company Revolve Technologies Ltd., working with Wrightbus,\u000a      to develop an engine management system which controls performance and\u000a      doubles the efficiency of the vehicle.\u000a    As well as the modelling and design of hybrid bus systems, this approach\u000a      is now being applied to evaluate the performance of new technologies and\u000a      for optimising non-hybrid powertrains. Wrightbus is continually searching\u000a      for lower fuel economy and better efficiency as their global market grows.\u000a      They have now employed one of the QUB research team members who developed\u000a      the vehicle model as their technology specialist.\u000a    The economic impact of this research has therefore been more widespread\u000a      throughout the global bus industry through the vehicle modelling work in collaboration\u000a        with Wrightbus Ltd, the leading manufacturer of city buses in the UK\u000a      and an exporter across the world from Singapore and Hong Kong to Las\u000a        Vegas. The research contribution has assisted Wrightbus in improving\u000a      their range of hybrid buses, in evaluating various technologies for fuel\u000a      economy improvement.\u000a    The New Bus for London had star billing during the London Olympics\u000a        with the first 4 prototypes operating and on display throughout 2012.\u000a      The Lord Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has acclaimed \"Christmas\u000a        has arrived early in the form of this revolutionary new bus...it is the\u000a      latest, greatest masterpiece of British engineering and design,\u000a        and I am certain it will become a much loved and iconic vehicle akin to\u000a        the legendary Routemaster from which it draws so much inspiration\".\u000a      Since 2012 buses have been gradually introduced to Central London routes\u000a      and being operated by Arriva.\u000a    Moreover the bus is seen as a way to improve London's air quality. The\u000a      full fleet will reduce NOx emissions by 57% and an astounding\u000a      230,000 tonnes of CO2 every year. Air pollution costs the UK\u000a      &#163;15bn per year, mainly from the cost of treating respiratory diseases\u000a      (e.g. asthma) and heart attacks that air pollution causes#.\u000a    The success is now attracting further investment from the partners in the\u000a      TSB supported project \"The Total Thermal Management of a Hybrid\u000a        Diesel-Electric Bus\" with Douglas and McCullough leading the QUB\u000a      team, and in 2012, a new development project was set up in collaboration\u000a      with Flybrid Automotive Ltd to apply the flywheel storage as used in\u000a      Formula 1 cars to city buses.\u000a    #Guardian article \"All Choked Up-Why is our\u000a        air so dirty\" 20th March 2013\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Using powertrain system models arising from QUB research Wrightbus\u000a        Ltd developed an advanced eco-friendly hybrid diesel-electric bus\u000a      which won the New Bus for London contract worth &#163;230M supplying 600\u000a        buses to Transport for London (commencing August 2012).\u000a      Demonstrating highly significant economic and environmental impacts the\u000a      bus has twice the fuel economy of a standard diesel and emits less than\u000a      half the CO2 and NOx.

Prior to this, much of the predictions for engines\u000a      used data from prototypes and operational systems, and little existed in\u000a      reliable models which could be used effect in design. Much of the problem\u000a      relates to the complexity of performance in a typical drive cycle which\u000a      has a large number of constantly changing parameters and is therefore\u000a      difficult to extract reliable average or predictive measures. The\u000a      breakthrough was in developing the 1-D code which though of low fidelity\u000a      allowed a complete predictive model to be established with reliable\u000a      output. The work continued throughout the late 1990s with the development\u000a      and implementation of component models for Internal Combustion (IC)\u000a      engines [1,2] leading to the evolution of fully operational engine\u000a      simulation code [3].\u000a    The success of the 1-D simulations allowed further development to the\u000a      broader powertrain system using 2-D models (Douglas &amp; McCullough,\u000a      joined 1999) and linking several system elements together to provide a\u000a      complete picture. This was achieved through the \"Virtual Engineering\u000a      Centre\" [6] with the theory for modelling of powertrain systems and\u000a      components [4], where the first simple vehicle models were developed and\u000a      tested. The team built state-of-the art test cells for validation of\u000a      performance over the full cycle. Validation of the models was a key aspect\u000a      of the development and techniques were developed both on test rigs and\u000a      on-road in vehicles and the data was compared with other published\u000a      information. This investment was a key part in improving the reliability\u000a      and accuracy of models, moving from the research environment to working\u000a      prototypes in operation.\u000a    To this point much of the work had been focused around traditional IC\u000a      engines but the capability now permitted consideration of hybrid\u000a      diesel-electric drives, which was previously too challenging with existing\u000a      approaches. Since 2005 Douglas, with co-workers Fleck and Kee, led the\u000a        final phase of this research, collaborating directly with Wrightbus on\u000a        development of techniques for modelling of vehicle powertrains for\u000a        hybrid vehicles [4,6,8]. From 2007 to 2009, full vehicle models were\u000a      constructed, tested and validated and detailed component models for items\u000a      such as batteries, motors, inverters, were developed. The models were then\u000a      assembled into useful design tools to allow Wrightbus to use them in\u000a      assessing system designs. In particular the full drive cycle was\u000a      investigated and the efficiency of each element of the system assessed.\u000a      Each element was then tuned by industry (collaborations involving\u000a      Wrightbus Ltd, Revolve Technologies Ltd) to allow maximum performance at\u000a      all phases of the drive cycle. It was the culmination of this\u000a        capability in 2009 that provided the key to the Wrightbus success,\u000a        allowing development of optimum performance across the whole system.\u000a    In the last phases, working with the industrial partners on the\u000a      development of the new generation buses extensive on-road testing was\u000a        undertaken at Millbrook testing facilities (2009), overseen by Douglas,\u000a      to capture real drive cycle data for validation and verification. The\u000a      models were extensively checked for accuracy and reliability over a range\u000a      of vehicles and over a range of drive cycles.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38371","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The collaboration between Ryobi Aluminium Casting and QUB has enabled the\u000a      company to develop knowledge and expertise in new areas which will have\u000a      long-term benefits.

This manifests itself\u000a      as less frequent die repair and a longer overall die life before it is\u000a      considered non-viable. The reduced frequency of die repair will directly\u000a      impact the overall equipment efficiency (OEE) of the die casting machine,\u000a      though this will also be influenced by reducing the number of scrap\u000a      castings.\u000a    As castings produced during die warm up are of inferior quality they are\u000a      scrapped. The revised start-up procedure reduces the number of\u000a        castings scrapped by as many as ten castings per die start up.\u000a      Although scrap castings are recycled, each time the metal is remelted up\u000a      to 8% of the material is lost as it oxidises and forms dross.\u000a      Additionally, it takes approximately 1 MJ\/kg to melt aluminium so there is\u000a      a significant energy saving from remelting less scrap castings.\u000a    The revised start-up cycle was tested at the start of June 2009\u000a      resulting in an immediate impact on scrap and the overall equipment\u000a      efficiency (OEE) of the casting machine.

Therefore the saving due to the reduction in part\u000a        cost alone is equivalent to &#163;81,250 per year per casting machine.\u000a    The 4.5% reduced scrap rate increases the number of good castings that\u000a      can be produced from the die within its normal working life. As a typical\u000a      die life, before it is considered uneconomical to repair, is 100,000 parts\u000a      and the manufacturing cost is of the order of &#163;200,000 this represents an\u000a        additional saving per year per casting machine of &#163;13,675. This does\u000a      not include savings made by extending the die life due to reducing the\u000a      thermally induced fatigue stress.\u000a    The shot weight per casting is approximately 12kg. As there is 4.5% less\u000a      scrap this represents 67.5 tonnes of metal per casting machine per year\u000a      that isn't remelted, saving 67.5 GJ of energy and potentially 5.4 tonnes\u000a      of material saved due to reduced dross loss.\u000a    Since 2009, Ryobi has rolled out the new casting start-up method across\u000a      the Carrickfergus factory's eleven die casting machines. Assuming\u000a        similar savings on all casting machines, this represents total savings\u000a        of approximately &#163;1,000,000 per year, 742 GJ energy saving and nearly 60\u000a        tonnes of aluminium alloy not reduced to dross.

At that time, the\u000a      university had limited expertise in this area. Dr Thornhill took the\u000a        lead in establishing a research program with Ryobi. Prior to\u000a      academia he had been a designer in industry and had extensive experience\u000a      of designing cast components and working with aluminium alloy foundries on\u000a      new products and troubleshooting existing ones. Professor Armstrong\u000a        provided valuable support through his expertise in numerical simulation.\u000a      He has an international reputation for his work in computer aided\u000a      engineering and in particular finite element analysis. He was also\u000a      co-author of the standard undergraduate text \"Mechanics of Engineering\u000a      Materials\".\u000a    Initial experimental research was carried out by Makoto Kurokawa, Ryobi\u000a      plant manager, under the guidance of Thornhill and Armstrong. It was\u000a      clear, however, that to make real progress a dedicated research associate\u000a      was required. With funding from INI and Ryobi, Alastair Long joined the\u000a      team in 2005. Long was a graduate of Queen's University but subsequent to\u000a      his degree had spent six years in industry with another large foundry,\u000a      Montupet, gaining significant expertise in computer simulation of the\u000a      casting process.\u000a    A thermal fatigue test rig, designed by Thornhill and developed by Long,\u000a      demonstrated that the dominant cause of die failure was the difference in\u000a      temperature between the high point in the cycle and the low point.\u000a      Computer simulation of the casting process using MAGMA casting simulation\u000a      software predicted that the temperature differences were greatest when a\u000a      die is first put into operation [1,2]. This was validated by instrumented\u000a      production dies with thermocouples implanted close to the dies surface and\u000a      strain gauges in pockets machined into the back of the die. It was\u000a      demonstrated that it could take between twelve and fifteen casting cycles\u000a      for the process to normalise and the corresponding fatigue loading to\u000a      minimise [3,4].\u000a    David Watson took over as Ryobi plant manager in 2007 and facilitated\u000a      experimental work on a production casting machine that allowed Long to\u000a      reduce the number of casting start-up cycles before the process normalises\u000a      down to as few as five by management of the die cooling system during this\u000a      crucial period [5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38372","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 2008 impact has been on an international scale with close\u000d\u000a      collaborations having been developed with major multinational medical\u000d\u000a      device company DePuy Synthes (Johnson &amp; Johnson), the largest, most\u000d\u000a      comprehensive orthopaedic and neurological business in the world.

The benefit of\u000d\u000a        the third generation device is that it is independent of hip joint\u000d\u000a        design, therefore can be used for placement of any design produced by\u000d\u000a        any manufacturer. Once the design is finalised, it will undergo\u000d\u000a      clinical trials with the eventual aim of launching the device to their\u000d\u000a      entire hip joint replacement market.\u000d\u000a    The only alternative to using the calliper is computer-aided surgery\u000d\u000a      (CAS) for assisting the surgeon in achieving correct component placement.\u000d\u000a      However, the added cost and increase in theatre time have inhibited\u000d\u000a      widespread take-up of CAS. Therefore the calliper technology is the\u000d\u000a        only economical and clinical proven method to achieve accurate component\u000d\u000a        placement on a repeatable basis.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Over 100,000 hip joint replacements are performed each year in the UK. The\u000a        correct restoration of joint centre is critical to the successful\u000d\u000a        outcome of total hip replacements. Failure to do so results in\u000d\u000a      dislocation, increased wear and leg length discrepancy.\u000d\u000a    In collaboration with QUB, over 4,000 patient-specific custom\u000a          hip prostheses were manufactured and implanted at Musgrave\u000d\u000a        Park Hospital, Belfast, leading to accurate restoration of anatomical\u000d\u000a        joint centre.\u000d\u000a    As a consequence a new surgical instrument has been developed and\u000d\u000a        utilised in more than 4,000 surgeries.

JFO was awarded the prestigious Samuel Haughton Silver\u000d\u000a        Medal in 2002 by the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland as\u000d\u000a      acknowledgment of his outstanding contribution to this field [1].\u000d\u000a    JFO's ongoing research collaboration with Professor David Beverland\u000d\u000a      (DEB), Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at Musgrave Park Hospital (MPH)\u000d\u000a      Belfast led to him being appointed as Honorary Professor within the School\u000d\u000a      of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in 2011. Professor Beverland\u000d\u000a        is a member of a development group of 10 world leading orthopaedic\u000d\u000a        surgeons who advise DePuy Synthes on clinical aspects of their hip joint\u000d\u000a        development strategy. For example, DEB was one of the first surgeons\u000d\u000a      to recognise issues relating to the DePuy ASR hip prior to its highly\u000d\u000a      publicised product recall in 2010.\u000d\u000a    The JFO-DEB collaboration attracted DePuy Synthes to locate the\u000d\u000a        world's first custom hip joint factory in Belfast in the mid 1990s.\u000d\u000a      Over 4,000 custom hips were precision manufactured on-site to exactly fit\u000d\u000a      the unique anatomical geometries of every patient. Custom hip replacements\u000d\u000a      were implanted over a 15 year period, with 5 and 10 and 15 year follow-ups\u000d\u000a      providing clear evidence of success and low revision rates [2]. As a\u000d\u000a      consequence of surgeons' requirement to make informed decision regarding\u000d\u000a      hip joint fixation a PhD project (research student Nicholas Dunne,\u000d\u000a      supervised by JFO, 1993-1996) was undertaken in association with the hip\u000d\u000a      joint factory at MPH. This work led to reproducible cement mantle\u000d\u000a      thickness for customised hips at MPH, a crucial step in implant\u000d\u000a      survivorship.\u000d\u000a    In a strategic move to further strengthen joint replacement research at\u000d\u000a      QUB, Professor Fraser Buchanan (FJB) was recruited in 1998 and then Dr\u000d\u000a      Nicholas Dunne (NJD) in 2003. FJB had studied degradation of polymers used\u000d\u000a      in hip joint replacements; which complimented the research activities of\u000d\u000a      JFO. They have published joint work that finally shed light on\u000d\u000a        understanding the biggest worldwide issue for the orthopaedic device\u000d\u000a        industry- hip joint wear. Between them they discovered that the wear\u000d\u000a      process was a multi-factorial problem relating to patient gait [3] and the\u000d\u000a      polymer degradation processes [4]. NJD is an internationally leading\u000d\u000a        authority on cement fixation technologies for total hip replacements\u000d\u000a      [5].\u000d\u000a    In association with JFO (a trustee) the Belfast Arthroplasty Research\u000d\u000a      Trust (BART) has been established (2001) to support clinically relevant\u000d\u000a      research with DEB's surgical team at MPH. The Trust has appointed its own\u000d\u000a      two research staff (both previously completed PhDs under supervision of\u000d\u000a      JFO, FJB and NJD) and fully funded two PhDs at QUB (supervisors JFO, FJB;\u000d\u000a      NJD, A Lennon). This successful clinical\/academic collaboration has\u000d\u000a        contributed to the development of a new surgical device for restoration\u000d\u000a        of hip centre focussing on the femoral component of the total hip\u000d\u000a      joint [6]. Furthermore research focussing on the acetabular (pelvic bone)\u000d\u000a      component has identified a novel device to allow the surgeon to choose and\u000d\u000a      record operative inclination accurately during total hip arthroplasty\u000d\u000a      surgery [7]. This has significant potential to reduce hip joint\u000d\u000a      dislocations.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38373","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 2008 the rotomoulding research group at QUB has continued to make a\u000d\u000a      major contribution to\u000d\u000a      the understanding of the process, the development of improved rotomoulding\u000d\u000a      grade polymers,\u000d\u000a      advances in the application of high performance polymers for more\u000d\u000a      demanding product\u000d\u000a      applications and novel developments in rotomoulding technology aimed at\u000d\u000a      improving the efficiency\u000d\u000a      and versatility of the process [1,2].\u000d\u000a    Global Industrial Training Seminars\u000d\u000a      Since 2008 QUB staff have trained over 400 personnel from companies\u000d\u000a      throughout the world in the\u000d\u000a      latest processing technologies arising from QUB rotational moulding\u000d\u000a      research.

Since the first publication of the\u000d\u000a      link-lock theory in the technical leather literature in 2008, the theory\u000d\u000a      was refined for further dissemination in the technical magazine World\u000d\u000a      Leather, Oct\/Nov 2010. The theory was used extensively in the argument for\u000d\u000a      predicting the processing by which desired characteristics could be\u000d\u000a      conferred to leather, published in the Journal of the Society of Leather\u000d\u000a      Technologists and Chemists, 2011, 95(6), 231, taken from the Procter\u000d\u000a      Memorial Lecture given to the Annual Conference of the Society of Leather\u000d\u000a      Technologists and Chemists of UK in 2010, and presented to the\u000d\u000a      International Union of Leather Technologists and Chemists Societies\u000d\u000a      Congress in Valencia, Spain in 2011, a biennial meeting of the technical\u000d\u000a      arm of the global leather industry.\u000d\u000a    The theory was extensively treated in the following book, the first\u000d\u000a      treatment of leather science since 1993, in which the future of tanning\u000d\u000a      was reviewed in the light of the new thinking: Covington, A.D., Tanning\u000d\u000a        Chemistry. The Science of Leather, Royal Society of Chemistry\u000d\u000a      Publishing, Cambridge, 2009 (ISBN:978-0-85404-170-1)\u000d\u000a    The link-lock theory, however, has been disseminated beyond academia into\u000d\u000a      the global leather and associated industries: it is known to be being used\u000d\u000a      in the thinking of leather scientists in the USA and Europe. In\u000d\u000a      particular, The American Leather Chemists Association (ALCA) gave\u000d\u000a      Covington the Alsop Award in 2011 for `outstanding scientific or\u000d\u000a        technological contribution to the leather industry'. It should be\u000d\u000a      noted that ALCA were founded in 1903 specifically to promote the\u000d\u000a      advancement of science and engineering in their application to the leather\u000d\u000a      and leather product industries.\u000d\u000a    In practical terms, the link-lock theory is informing the development\u000d\u000a      programme of the Lanxess company of Germany. They are currently marketing\u000d\u000a      a new tanning agent based on poly (carbamoyl) sulfonate, In order to\u000d\u000a      optimise the effect of the reagent in the market, the link-lock theory is\u000d\u000a      being used to define how the technology can be extended in terms of\u000d\u000a      combinations of other chemicals with the base reagent. In this way, a new\u000d\u000a      generation of tanning processes can be devised, allowing tanners an\u000d\u000a      organic option to the global standard of chrome tanning and a means to\u000d\u000a      avoid the environmental difficulties of using metal chemistry (contact Dr.\u000d\u000a      Dietrich Tegtmeyer, Lanxess).\u000d\u000a    Link-lock is also the basis of the thinking in trying to define the\u000d\u000a      development of a new generation of tanning chemicals being undertaken by\u000d\u000a      Buckman International, an American based chemical supply house for whom\u000d\u000a      Covington acted as Consultant in 2011. Since there is a developing market\u000d\u000a      for leather which is chromium free, they like other supply houses are\u000d\u000a      interested in supplying alternative tanning reagents to the tanning\u000d\u000a      industry. Here, the particular interest lies in organic alternatives to\u000d\u000a      chromium(III) chemistry and any successful alternative must match as many\u000d\u000a      of the properties of chrome tanned leather as possible. The only way to\u000d\u000a      achieve high hydrothermal stability, required in modern applications of\u000d\u000a      leather, is to use the principles of link-lock (contact Mr. Elton Hurlow,\u000d\u000a      Buckman).\u000d\u000a    The ECCO company, a multinational leather business based in The\u000d\u000a      Netherlands, Indonesia and P.R. of China, currently sends cohorts (ca.10\u000d\u000a      pa) of its brightest technologists to the University of Northampton for\u000d\u000a      the MSc in Leather Technology. The purpose is to educate them in the\u000d\u000a      latest thinking, in which link-lock theory and associated developments are\u000d\u000a      central. Graduates return to their factories equipped with the ability to\u000d\u000a      engage in development programmes to make operations more profitable: this\u000d\u000a      is the return on the investment made by the parent company (contact Mr.\u000d\u000a      Arthur Jones, ECCO).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The leather industry is globally significant: the supply chain, from\u000d\u000a      leather production to leather goods manufacture is currently worth in the\u000d\u000a      order of $1 trillion per annum. Although written records show that leather\u000d\u000a      production is at least 5,000 years old, an understanding of the chemical\u000d\u000a      principles underpinning the reactions involved only began at the turn of\u000d\u000a      the 19th century, roughly corresponding to the development of\u000d\u000a      modern chemistry and, coincidentally, with the revolutionary introduction\u000d\u000a      of chrome tanning. At that time, the basis of the stabilising reaction was\u000d\u000a      assumed to be crosslinking, whereby the component strands of protein are\u000d\u000a      linked like stitches by the tanning chemical and this was the accepted\u000d\u000a      view thereafter. Furthermore, it was also accepted that the ability of\u000d\u000a      tanning reactions to confer high hydrothermal stability is a property of a\u000d\u000a      few unrelated chemistries, of which chromium(III) tanning is the best\u000d\u000a      known example.\u000d\u000a    Link-lock theory is revolutionary, insofar as it is the first new\u000d\u000a      thinking in the chemical stabilisation of collagen in over half a century.\u000d\u000a      This view of tanning was the outcome of examining the reaction with modern\u000d\u000a      analytical instrumentation and applying a weight of evidence from the\u000d\u000a      literature. The consequence has been the rejection of the accepted view of\u000d\u000a      tanning mechanism, in favour of a simpler but more powerful theory. The\u000d\u000a      principles of the theory can explain the effects of all known tanning\u000d\u000a      processes.

Here, the most important\u000d\u000a      experimental collaboration was with the Universities of Canterbury and\u000d\u000a      Manchester, when X-ray studies were undertaken on the synchrotron at\u000d\u000a      Daresbury [3]. This was the first time the chrome tanning reaction had\u000d\u000a      been subjected to examination at the molecular level. Although it had been\u000d\u000a      expected that the observations on collagen tanned with basic chromium(III)\u000d\u000a      sulfate would confirm the prevalent view of crosslinking, unexpectedly,\u000d\u000a      the direct evidence contradicted it as follows:\u000d\u000a    (i) bound chromium is in the form of a linear tetramer, not a dimer.\u000d\u000a    (ii) sulfate is not bound to chromium species as a ligand &#8212; it functions\u000d\u000a      as a stabilising component of the reaction i.e. the chrome tanning\u000d\u000a      reaction has a combination mechanism.\u000d\u000a    (iii) if the chrome tanning reaction is dependent on the crosslinking\u000d\u000a      mechanism, the outcome would be independent of the anion: however, the\u000d\u000a      tanning reaction is highly dependent on the anion e.g. tanning with\u000d\u000a      chromium(III) chloride or perchlorate can only yield shrinkage temperature\u000d\u000a      no higher than 85oC, like any other single tanning species.\u000d\u000a    The latter observation means that chrome tanning falls into line with\u000d\u000a      other known reactions capable of conferring high hydrothermal stability,\u000d\u000a      but are characterised as combination processes e.g. plant hydrolysable\u000d\u000a      polyphenol + aluminium(III) salt.\u000d\u000a    Therefore, all tanning reactions, regardless of the chemical nature of\u000d\u000a      the tanning agents and the way they react with collagen, are fundamentally\u000d\u000a      the same, insofar as they merely physically interfere with the shrinking\u000d\u000a      mechanism when collagen is heated in water. Consequently, any single\u000d\u000a      reagent is only capable of raising the observed denaturation temperature\u000d\u000a      from 65 to no more than 85oC: this is referred to as the\u000d\u000a      linking reaction. If a second reagent is applied, it can react on the\u000d\u000a      collagen and interact with the first reagent in one of three ways:\u000d\u000a      independently, antagonistically or synergistically. In the latter case,\u000d\u000a      the reaction is designated the locking reaction, because it locks the\u000d\u000a      molecules of the first reaction together: in this way, a new tanning\u000d\u000a      system is created, a matrix or scaffolding, which stabilises the collagen\u000d\u000a      by concerted interactions\/bonds. The consequence of this process is that,\u000d\u000a      when the modified collagen is subjected to wet heat, it is much more\u000d\u000a      difficult for the triple helix structure of collagen to unravel and for\u000d\u000a      the random coils of the denatured protein to collapse into the interstices\u000d\u000a      of the highly organised collagen structure: this is observed as a marked\u000d\u000a      raising of the shrinkage temperature, up to 130oC [4].\u000d\u000a    The theory incorporates a new understanding of the chrome tanning\u000d\u000a      reaction: more importantly, this understanding provides the basis for\u000d\u000a      making improvements not only in the properties and performance of chrome\u000d\u000a      tanned leather but also to the environmental impact of its production [5,\u000d\u000a      6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38916","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Prior to PEPT, much of the understanding and optimisation of industrial\u000d\u000a      processes was performed\u000d\u000a      via mathematical modelling without the crucial ability to experimentally\u000d\u000a      validate the models.

PEPT is a variant of the\u000d\u000a      medical imaging\u000d\u000a      technique positron emission tomography (PET). Both rely on detecting the\u000d\u000a      pairs of back-to-back\u000d\u000a      gamma-rays emitted during positron\/electron annihilation as a first step\u000d\u000a      to localising a positron-emitting\u000d\u000a\u0009  radioactive tracer, but whereas in PET the concentration of a\u000d\u000a      radioactively-labelled fluid\u000d\u000a      tracer is mapped in 3D, in PEPT a single radioactively-labelled particle\u000d\u000a      is accurately tracked at high\u000d\u000a      velocity.

The launch of these new products has secured P&amp;G's\u000a      dominant position in\u000a      these markets as No. 1 supplier of sensory products; Downy, Febreze, Lenor\u000a      and Tide are all\u000a      major Billion Dollar brands for P&amp;G5.1.\u000a    P&amp;G made the strategic decision to develop a large number of new\u000a      functional products with\u000a      microcapsules in 2003, this decision involved Professor Zhibing Zhang who\u000a      was invited to join a\u000a      consortium with nine experts in encapsulation and characterisation from\u000a      different countries as\u000a      consultants to the company. It was at this stage that the potential of the\u000a      micromanipulation\u000a      technique was first highlighted within P&amp;G. Perfume was first\u000a      considered to be encapsulated,\u000a      which would be incorporated into sensory detergent products for fabric\u000a      care. The microcapsules for\u000a      such applications should have desirable mechanical, structural and surface\u000a      properties. In\u000a      particular, they should be strong enough to survive a number of processing\u000a      steps required to\u000a      manufacture final products, including mixing, pumping, and extrusion, but\u000a      should be weak enough\u000a      to be ruptured by mechanical forces generated by rubbing and friction on\u000a      fabric surfaces to release\u000a      perfume. In addition, the microcapsules should be stable in detergents\u000a      during storage and in\u000a      laundry processes, and be able to deposit on fabric surfaces. To meet\u000a      these criteria requires\u000a      appropriate formulation and processing of perfume microcapsules. The\u000a      performances of sensory\u000a      detergent products with perfume microcapsules are normally determined by\u000a      consumer tests, which\u000a      are time-consuming and expensive.\u000a    Using the Birmingham micromanipulation technique, the mechanical strength\u000a      of microcapsules as\u000a      a function of their formulation and processing conditions can be\u000a      characterised, and appropriate\u000a      candidates selected for incorporation into products. Not only has this\u000a      approach reduced the time\u000a      and cost of product development (and thus environmental impact), the novel\u000a      measurements\u000a      developed have enabled microcapsules to be used in products for the first\u000a      time (see David York\u000a      letter of support5.2)\u000a    Given the critical importance of the micromanipulation data in the\u000a      development of these products, it\u000a      is perhaps unsurprising that Professor Zhibing Zhang's group has had 12\u000a      research projects, fully\u000a      funded or co-funded by P&amp;G since 2001. In addition, he served as a\u000a      consultant to P&amp;G and\u000a      Appleton Paper Inc. USA (now named as Encapsys) in 2006-2008, and took a\u000a      secondment for 3\u000a      months in P&amp;G in 2007, funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering. ZZ\u000a      has provided advice on\u000a      improving various aspects of microcapsule formulation, processing and\u000a      characterisation (See letter\u000a      of support from Prof. David York, FREng5.2). For\u000a      example, during the secondment, he did an\u000a      analysis of mechanical damage to perfume microcapsules when they were\u000a      mixed with dry\u000a      detergent granules. Based on this analysis, P&amp;G developed a new\u000a      process of agglomeration of\u000a      microcapsules to protect them in 2008, which has significantly reduced\u000a      their damage.\u000a    Particularly since 2008, Prof Zhang has provided scientific services to\u000a      analyse the mechanical\u000a      strength of more than a hundred of perfume microcapsule samples using the\u000a      above mentioned\u000a      micromanipulation technique, which were prepared by the companies using\u000a      different formulation\u000a      and processing conditions. Moreover, the impact generated from the above\u000a      research on P&amp;G's\u000a      development of new products with perfume microcapsules helped to establish\u000a      a strategic and long-term\u000a\u0009  partnership between P&amp;G and University of Birmingham in 2010, and\u000a      contributed significantly\u000a      as a case study within the School's successful application for a Queen's\u000a      Anniversary Prize in 2011.\u000a      A number of patents have been filed based upon the Birmingham fracture\u000a      strength data.5.3-5.6\u000a    The micromanipulation technique has also been used to characterise other\u000a      microparticles supplied\u000a      and exploited by other international companies during the REF period of\u000a      2008-2013.\u000a      Characterisation of the compression behaviour of chromatographic\u000a      microparticles produced by\u000a      Tosoh Bioscience has enabled the company to understand better how to pack\u000a      and operate\u000a      industrial scale chromatography columns (See letter of support from Dr E.\u000a      M&#252;ller5.7).\u000a    Other microcapsules characterised include perfume microcapsules from ICI,\u000a      UK (2008) and\u000a      National Starch, USA (2008-2010); perfume microcapsules from Firmenich SA\u000a      Corporate R&amp;D,\u000a      Switzerland (2008-2010), perfume microcapsules from Unilever, UK, the\u000a      Netherlands and China\u000a      (2001-), perfume microcapsules from Givaudan Schweiz AG, Switzerland and\u000a      UK (2007-)\u000a      microspheres from Micropore Technologies Ltd., UK (2011) and perfume\u000a      microcapsules from\u000a      International Flavors and Fragrances, USA (2012). The data generated has\u000a      also helped these\u000a      companies develop commercial products containing these micro-particles.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact presented in this case study is the commercialisation of 15\u000a      products with perfume\u000a      microcapsules by Procter and Gamble (P&amp;G), made possible using capsule\u000a      mechanical strength\u000a      data provided by Prof Zhibing Zhang's research group at Birmingham.

Mechanical characterisation of single\u000a      micro-particles is essential\u000a      to detect the variation between individual micro-particles, and predict\u000a      their behaviour during\u000a      manufacturing and their performance in end-use applications.\u000a    However, it had not been possible to measure the mechanical properties of\u000a      single micro-particles\u000a      due to technical difficulties until a novel micromanipulation technique\u000a      was developed at\u000a      Birmingham. The micromanipulation technique is based on compression of\u000a      single particles\u000a      between two parallel surfaces and measurement of the force imposed versus\u000a      displacement of the\u000a      particles. Following the early work on micromanipulation studies of the\u000a      mechanical properties of\u000a      biological materials (1991-1994), the technique was applied to measure the\u000a      mechanical properties\u000a      of single starch granules and skin cells for Unilever (1995-1996) and\u000a      herbicide agglomerates for\u000a      Zeneca Agrochemicals (1996-1997).\u000a    The technique was adapted to measure the bursting strength of single\u000a      microcapsules in\u000a      collaboration with Mr Richard Saunders, Argo Wiggins Research and\u000a      Development Ltd. UK3.1 in\u000a      1998 which forms the basis of methodologies used in this impact case\u000a      study. From 10.1998 to\u000a      10.2000, a research project on \"Micromanipulation studies of microcapsule\u000a      strength\" funded by\u000a      EPSRC was undertaken by Prof. Z. Zhang, employing a research fellow Dr\u000a      Guangzhi Sun.\u000a      Microcapsules made of a shell of melamine formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde\u000a      or gelatin and a core\u000a      of oil were prepared and their rupture force, deformation at rupture in\u000a      relation to their size, shell\u000a      thickness and preparation conditions have been characterised, resulting in\u000a      two academic journal\u000a      papers3.2,3.3 and 3 conference publications. This laid the\u000a      foundation for all subsequent work\u000a      performed in Prof Zhang's group on microparticles which led to the\u000a      collaboration with a number of\u000a      international companies. For example, the micromanipulation technique has\u000a      been used to measure\u000a      various micro-particles provided by international companies, including\u000a      microcapsules from Bayer,\u000a      Germany (2001); drug granules from Merck Sharp and Dohme, UK (2002);\u000a      vitamin granules from\u000a      Roche, Switzerland (2002); microcapsules as artificial organs from\u000a      Bavarian Nordic, Germany\u000a      (2001-2005); flavour microcapsules from Rhodia, France (2003-2005),\u000a      chromatography media in\u000a      microspheres from MILLIPORE Bioprocessing Ltd (2006) and microcapsules\u000a      from P&amp;G, and thus\u000a      led to the development of novel products containing microcapsules.\u000a    Single micro-particles can be compressed and held to detect their\u000a      visco-elastic behaviour,\u000a      compressed and released to determine their elastic limit and plastic\u000a      behaviour, and compressed to\u000a      rupture to evaluate their rupture strength. Moreover, the force versus\u000a      displacement data can be\u000a      modelled either analytically or by using finite element analysis (FEA) to\u000a      determine their intrinsic\u000a      mechanical property parameters. For compression of elastic microspheres,\u000a      the Hertz model or\u000a      Tatara model has been used by Professors Z. Zhang and M. Adams (2003-2006)\u000a      to fit\u000a      experimental data corresponding to small or large deformations to\u000a      determine the elastic modulus\u000a      of the materials. For visco-elastic micro-spheres with small deformation,\u000a      an extended Hertz model\u000a      was developed by Professors M. Adams and Z. Zhang (2003-2006) to account\u000a      for the time-dependent\u000a\u0009  behaviour. For visco-elastic microspheres such as calcium\u000a      alginate with large\u000a      deformations, finite element analysis was applied Professors Z. Zhang and\u000a      C. R. Thomas (1997-2010)\u000a\u0009  to determine their visco-elastic property parameters including the\u000a      instantaneous elastic\u000a      modulus, the equilibrium elastic modulus and relaxation times.\u000a    For spherical microcapsules with a liquid core and solid shell such as\u000a      melamine formaldehyde\u000a      (MF) microcapsules with perfume, the micromanipulation measurements\u000a      demonstrate that the MF\u000a      microcapsules were mainly elastic at small deformations, elastic-perfectly\u000a      plastic at moderate\u000a      deformations, and plastic with strain hardening at large deformations\u000a      leading to rupture. The work\u000a      was undertaken by Prof. Z. Zhang from 2006-2010. Moreover, finite element\u000a      analysis3.4, 3.5, 3.6 has\u000a      been used by Prof. Z. Zhang to determine the elastic modulus, shell\u000a      thickness, yield stress, strain\u000a      hardening modulus, strain and stress at rupture of the microcapsule shell\u000a      materials made from\u000a      different formulations and at different processing conditions (2009-2011).\u000a    Different types of microcapsules to encapsulate various active\u000a      ingredients were prepared using in-situ\u000a\u0009  polymerisation, interfacial polymerisation, coacervation, gelation\u000a      etc, and the mechanical\u000a      properties of the formed microcapsules and their other properties\u000a      including encapsulation\u000a      efficiency, release rate of the core materials, storage stability in\u000a      liquid environment and their\u000a      adhesion on fabric surface were characterised to determine appropriate\u000a      formulation and\u000a      processing conditions for industrial applications.

The particular contribution of Birmingham's Chemical\u000a      Engineering research to the economic success of the UK's food and drink\u000a      sector was highlighted in 2010 in an independent report by Oxford\u000a      Economics: this report used Norton's research as its leading example of\u000a      chemistry's contribution to the industry and described the work as\u000a      providing \"a useful illustration of the beneficial impact of chemistry\u000a        research on the food supply chain.\" 5.5\u000a    This case study demonstrates one key strand of this work: the importance\u000a      of Birmingham's research in enabling global food companies to address the\u000a      specific challenge of producing volume-sales food products that have low\u000a      or zero fat content whilst retaining the taste and texture required by\u000a      consumers.\u000a    \"...the food industry is global and highly competitive.

An example is a fundamental mechanistic\u000a      understanding of emulsion behaviour in flow allowing control of the local\u000a      physics in order to use phase inversion in the production of fat\u000a      continuous products with as little as 10% fat phase. In order to do this\u000a      the industry required detailed understanding of the role of the\u000a      structuring agents and the kinetics of phase changes in the processes.\u000a      This knowledge allowed process engineers to position crystals at the\u000a      interface and thus to control droplet breakup and re-coalescence. The\u000a      crystal position in the interface of droplets (Pickering emulsions) makes\u000a      them inherently more stable on storage but can enhance coalescence in flow\u000a      thus allowing the food manufacturer to economically produce stable fat\u000a      continuous emulsions at fat contents which would inherently be more stable\u000a      if water continuous (&gt; 50% water). These structures are kinetically\u000a      trapped as a result of the crystals in the interface, which can then be\u000a      used to trigger flavour release and give the desired oral properties on\u000a      consumption.\u000a    An additional key aspect was the research carried out to control the\u000a      relative viscosities of the two phases in emulsion products. As the oil's\u000a      viscosity is fixed (edible triglyceride oils) this required research on\u000a      the use of hydrocolloid physical chemistry to structure the aqueous phase\u000a      during processing. This is a complex issue as the hydrocolloids also\u000a      impact on sensory properties of the final product. The research was thus\u000a      aimed to control both in process and on consumption parameters separately.\u000a    In summary, the research carried out at the University allowed the\u000a      industry to induce a self-catalytic inversion process by controlling and\u000a      manipulating crystals at the oil\/water interface. Because of this research\u000a      inversion now becomes temperature controlled (not time controlled)\u000a      allowing rapid inversion (the process runs at 10 tonnes\/hour resulting in\u000a      short residence times requiring control and manipulation of the kinetics\u000a      of the material phase changes) and continuous production of low and very\u000a      low fat spreads. This work was originally carried out by Prof. Pacek (at\u000a      the time a PDRA, a Professor since 2006) who supervised Nixon3.1\u000a      (PhD student) in the early to mid 90's and has been continued by Norton's\u000a      group also with Dr Cox (PDRA 2006-2009, lecturer 2009-), and Dr\u000a      Spyropoulos (PhD 2003-2006, PDRA 2006-2010 now lecturer 2010-)\u000a    The mechanistic understanding of the use of physical structuring of the\u000a      aqueous phase to reduce coalescence rates in the process (a processing\u000a      aid) and to produce small water droplets that give favourable organoleptic\u000a      response due to control and manipulation of material breakdown rates; was\u000a      carried out by Spyropoulos and Ding (PDRA) in Pacek's group from 2003-2007\u000a      and sponsored by Unilever3.2 (Bettina Wolf).\u000a    This original work was then supplemented by further investigations at the\u000a      University into phase separating biopolymer systems and how these can be\u000a      controlled via the process conditions. Again the work carried out at the\u000a      University into aqueous\/aqueous two phase systems led to the ability to\u000a      produce zero fat spreads (products marketed in the USA and UK) which are\u000a      stable on storage and breakdown when consumed to give the physical\u000a      properties and flavour release expected from margarine. This has been\u000a      carried out by Spyropoulos3.3 since 2007.\u000a    The second spin off was into what is now called fluid gels3.4.\u000a      This is where the structuring of hydrocolloids is carried out in different\u000a      flow regimes. The forming network is then constrained by the flow profile\u000a      and gel is formed on a micro scale. The particles thus formed have the\u000a      properties of the bulk gel but only over small distance scales. The\u000a      particles formed can be manipulated by the choice of hydrocolloid type,\u000a      the concentration and the solvent quality. If formulated in the right way\u000a      we have shown that these particles can replace fat in emulsions.\u000a    The researchers are now developing the science for a number of other\u000a      areas &#8212; including patented technology for chocolate involving Prof. Fryer\u000a      and Jennifer Norton3.5 (PhD student 2007-2010), patented\u000a      technology for Bakery fats, low fat snacks for Pepsi, Safa reduced bakery\u000a      systems etc. This has taken the area of Pickering emulsions to the next\u000a      level of complexity, involving understanding of surface crystallisation\u000a      and crystal growth, engineering of crystallisation process and physics of\u000a      particles at interfaces. Additionally the University has funding to\u000a      understand duplex emulsions &#8212; based on the physical chemistry and\u000a      microstructure of shell formation around droplets. This has been carried\u000a      out by Norton and Sarah Frasch-Melnik3.6 (PhD student\u000a      2007-2010).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39366","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Cranfield developed a best practice process and software tool to predict\u000a      the obsolescence resolution cost for electronic components and materials\u000a      (figure 1).

The team helped Airbus to implement the CADCO tool\u000a      set across Europe and provided extensive training.\u000a    \u000a\u0009Figure 1: Predicted cost of obsolescence resolution with uncertainties\u000a\u0009\u000a      Cost Engineering at Cranfield has developed novel approaches and tools\u000a        to predict the true whole life cost of complex engineering systems [C7,\u000a        C8]. Cranfield has provided cost engineering training for over 12 years\u000a        and has trained over 700 engineers in over 50 companies with an\u000a        indicative financial impact of &#163;12 million per annum. Cranfield's effort\u000a        in improving the cost engineering practice across defence, aerospace,\u000a        automotive, railway, oil and gas companies has resulted in more\u000a        recognition of cost as a design driver and has helped in improving the\u000a        competitiveness. The indicative financial benefit from cost engineering\u000a        software developed at Cranfield (figure 1) is over &#163;400 million per\u000a        annum [C2], and the UK MoD is disseminating the software to more\u000a        companies such that and the financial impact will be further increased\u000a        significantly.\u000a      To estimate savings, we consider that the UK civil aerospace sector\u000a        alone has revenue of &#163;12 billion per annum [C9]. The training delivered\u000a        by the Cranfield team is estimated to help British aerospace companies\u000a        to gain at least an additional 0.01% of this market, which is an\u000a        additional &#163;12 million per annum new business.\u000a      Cranfield developed cost engineering training and education programmes,\u000a      based on this research, with BAE Systems, Airbus, Ford Motor Company,\u000a      Rolls-Royce, Bombardier Transportation and the Ministry of Defence (MoD)\u000a      since 2001 [G1]. The initial training programme at BAE Systems focused on\u000a      bridging the gap between the technical\/ engineering functions and finance.\u000a      The training improved the communication between the two groups and\u000a      therefore improved the cost estimating practice and policy, encouraging\u000a      the company to establish \"cost engineering\" as a distinct function. Once\u000a      the cognitive model for the cost engineers was captured, the team\u000a      developed detailed cost engineering training for the automotive industry\u000a      with Ford Motor Company and for the MoD in 2003, which is used to reduce\u000a      the learning curve of the novice. The training also included a `cost\u000a      awareness development programme' across Airbus (within Europe) and BAE\u000a      Systems. The training supported design engineers, manufacturing engineers\u000a      and procurement team members to improve their cost awareness. Since 2006,\u000a      the Cranfield team has delivered an online cost engineering course on\u000a      `Principles of Cost Engineering'. UK and international manufacturing\u000a      (aerospace, automotive, railway, oil and gas) and defence companies use\u000a      the course regularly. The face-to-face and online training courses have\u000a      supported companies like Airbus, Rolls-Royce, and BAE Systems to become\u000a      more competitive and manage their costs better, [C3,4,5,6].\u000a      ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Substantial savings have been made using Cranfield's Cost Engineering\u000a      software tools and techniques.

The goal was to understand the science and engineering behind\u000a      current industrial practice so that cost engineering could become more\u000a      scientific and systematic in the future. Our studies established the best\u000a      practice in true cost prediction, and have developed software tools and\u000a      training, which have improved the competitiveness of UK manufacturing\u000a      companies. We studied how cost engineers think, and modelled the cognitive\u000a      processes behind the engineering judgement necessary for the cost\u000a      prediction [G1, 3, P1]. The study involved analysing the reasoning process\u000a      followed during cost estimating by both experts and novices. Research into\u000a      this cognitive process became the foundation for our cost engineering\u000a      training, which has been developed for industry since 2003.\u000a    The Cranfield team progressed to research best practice in predicting the\u000a      cost of new technologies, based on analogy, in collaboration with the\u000a      automotive industry [P2]. Then the team focused on predicting cost of\u000a      design, manufacturing and assembly at the conceptual design stage for\u000a      complex engineering systems, e.g. for aircraft wings and hydraulic\u000a      systems. The scope of this prediction covered the design effort, including\u000a      both the thinking time and the Computer Aided Design model development\u000a      time, based on the complexity of the product [G2-4, P3]. The research\u000a      included both mechanical and electronic components design and testing.\u000a      Novel techniques (e.g. function based cost estimating for automotive\u000a      components) were developed which can predict more realistic cost at the\u000a      conceptual design stage, in the absence of data of good quality and\u000a      quantity [P4].\u000a    Our research focused on predicting the cost of in-service issues,\u000a      especially within performance based contracts. The key challenges\u000a      addressed in the research are:\u000a    &#8212; predicting the cost of the resolution of component and material\u000a    obsolescence, based on a probabilistic approach [G5, P5];\u000a    &#8212; modelling service uncertainty within the cost estimates using an analogy\u000a    based approach [G5, P6].\u000a    The probabilistic cost estimation approach identified the relationships\u000a      between component complexity and obsolescence resolution profile. We\u000a      identified that the cost efficiency achieved by organisations in relation\u000a      to obsolescence correlates with how proactive they are in managing the\u000a      problem. Understanding of this has informed the design of new tools for\u000a      predicting the non-recurring engineering effort\/cost for obsolescence\u000a      resolution [P5].\u000a    The analogy and uncertainty based cost estimating technique identifies the\u000a    new challenges related to availability contracts, and enables a systematic\u000a    approach that reflects the impact of uncertainties on the cost drivers [P6].\u000a    The research identifies a cost distribution for the service provision using\u000a    a stochastic simulation. The research also allows us to understand the\u000a    enduring cost profile across a product\/system\/service life cycle and is\u000a    fundamental to improving UK capability in cost modelling for large and\u000a    complex projects in industry and the public sector.\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Key Researchers\u000a          Post details*\u000a          Dates involved\u000a          Research\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr. P Baguley\u000a          Research\u000a            Fellow\u000a          2006 &#8211; to date\u000a          Artificial intelligence application for cost\u000a            estimation, parametric cost estimating\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr. Y Xu\u000a          Lecturer\u000a          2008 &#8211; to date\u000a          Design for cost, detailed cost estimation\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr. E Shehab\u000a          Reader\u000a          2004 &#8211; to date\u000a          Cost of obsolescence, Cost of information\u000a            preservation\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Dr. C Wainwright\u000a          Senior\u000a            Lecturer\u000a          2001 &#8211; 2008\u000a          Parametric cost estimation, CADCO project\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Prof R Roy\u000a          Professor\u000a          1997 &#8211; to date\u000a          All the above, plus uncertainty- and\u000a            analogy-based service and qualitative cost\u000a            estimation\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    * highest grade in period given\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42147","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The pivotal contribution of our research to UK, US and International\u000a      Standards and Codes is evident from their direct citations to our research\u000a      papers.

The cost of lost output is roughly $1M per day for a\u000a      typical 1,000 MWe AGR plant. In 2010, 10 GWe of electricity was generated\u000a      in UK AGR plants. The cost of refurbishing these old plants in order to\u000a      run beyond their design life is estimated at &#163;200-300M per GWe. The cost\u000a      of new-build could be as much as &#163;5,000M per GWe. The details of the\u000a      savings conferred by the use of our Standards are confidential to EDF.\u000a      However, even at a nominal 1-5% of the annual savings from extending plant\u000a      life and reducing plant downtime, our contribution is millions of pounds\u000a      annually. The sale of the Standards and Codes to Industry also generates\u000a      UK revenue: on average two hundred licenses worldwide at &#163;10,000 per annum\u000a      is &#163;2M as confirmed by a High Temperature Specialist in the Assessment\u000a      Technology Group of EDF Energy [A].\u000a    The wide international acceptance of the Standards and Codes makes the UK\u000a      a global leader in methodologies for high-temperature safety in the\u000a      nuclear industry. For example, our Standards and Codes have been directly\u000a      adopted by ASME in the US, as well as by nuclear safety bodies in Japan\u000a      and Korea [A]. Indeed, High Temperature Specialist in the Assessment\u000a      Technology Group of EDF Energy [A] has stated that: \"Professor Nikbin\u000a        and his colleagues have significantly influenced key developments in R5\u000a        assessment procedures, which are used to assess the integrity of\u000a        components in the UK's Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors (AGRs) which operate\u000a        in the creep range. Of particular note are their important contributions\u000a        in driving improvements in predictive modelling of the creep crack\u000a        growth process and in developing an improved understanding of the role\u000a        of residual stresses in the incubation and growth of cracks under creep\u000a        conditions. Furthermore their significant contributions in the field of\u000a        creep crack growth testing and high temperature assessment methods have\u000a        led directly to improvements in international standards, including ASTM\u000a        E1457, ASTM E2670 and BS 7910.\"\u000a    The Standards on the Fracture Resistance of Plastics, Composites and\u000a        Adhesives: ISO 25217 (2009), ISO CD 15114 (2011).\u000a    The research underpinning these Standards has made fracture-mechanics\u000a      techniques accessible to industrial users, bridging the\u000a      theoretical-experimental divide. At Airbus, our fracture-mechanics\u000a      Standards are now routinely employed for materials qualification,\u000a      calculation of design allowables and process control. The need for light,\u000a      optimised, airframes and adhesively-bonded connections has heightened\u000a      interest in fracture-mechanics techniques. The proportion of composite\u000a      materials in aircraft has grown dramatically to reach 53% in the A350XWB.\u000a      The cost benefits of weight savings are impressive. Every kilogram shed\u000a      means not only substantial fuel-cost savings but also CO2\u000a      emission reductions of over 16 tonnes per year. The Head of Structural\u000a      Engineering Methods at Airbus [B] has stated: \"The design of advanced\u000a        composite structures relies, at some stage, on the assessment of\u000a        fracture mechanics parameters. Fracture mechanics standards are key in\u000a        ensuring that co-cured\/co-bonded components are at a specific\u000a        performance level. Also, the control quality of incoming materials or\u000a        manufactured elements relies on process control specimens, again derived\u000a        from the same fracture mechanics standards. The excellent research on\u000a        fracture mechanics by Blackman and Kinloch at Imperial College has been\u000a        crucial in the development and publication of the ISO Standards on\u000a        cracking in composites and structural adhesives. These Standards are\u000a        used extensively by Airbus in these areas and have led to significant\u000a        savings from improved design and smarter production and repair methods.\"\u000a    GKN and Rolls Royce rely on our Standards when using adhesive-bonding\u000a      techniques for aero-engine components like metal-composite fan blades. Our\u000a      fracture-mechanics Standards were essential to determining the optimum\u000a      surface pretreatment techniques for bonding titanium-alloy and\u000a      fibre-reinforced plastic composites.

Their research has led\u000a      to:\u000a    \u000a      The development of the fracture-mechanics parameter C* for\u000a        elevated temperatures.\u000a      Innovative analytical and numerical models to predict crack initiation\u000a        and growth.\u000a    \u000a    Previous ASTM Standards for creep crack-growth (CCG) were limited to the\u000a      use of the high- constraint compact-tension specimen. Davies and Nikbin\u000a      developed experimental CCG testing methods on alternative specimen designs\u000a      with a range of constraint levels [1] that allow a more accurate\u000a      representation across a range of in-service conditions. The development of\u000a      improved assessment and predictive methods of failure in components is an\u000a      extremely urgent research area that is being continually developed to be\u000a      able to be one step ahead of Nuclear Safety issues in the UK's ageing AGR\u000a      fleet. As an example, Nikbin's paper [2], which won the `Best Paper Award'\u000a      in the ASME conference in San Diego (1998), describes the validation of\u000a      the methodologies and paved the way for increased support from EDF for\u000a      this work. The resulting methodologies are used in many Standards and\u000a      Codes including ASTM Standards E1457-07 (2012) and E2760-10 (2012), R5 EDF\u000a      Energy Code of Practice (2012) and BS 7910 (2013).\u000a    The Fracture Resistance of Plastics, Composites and Adhesives\u000a      Blackman and Kinloch's work underpins the Standards to determine fracture\u000a      toughness under a variety of service conditions. Their innovative\u000a      development of highly accurate, strain-energy release-rate methods based\u000a      on analytical beam theories [3], led directly to ISO 25217 (2009). Earlier\u000a      ASTM Standards, based on a simple-beam model, were over-conservative and\u000a      limited in scope. Blackman and Kinloch's `corrected beam' model accounted\u000a      for the effects of beam-root rotation and transverse shear. These are\u000a      crucial factors when fracture-testing adhesives and fibre- composite\u000a      plastics which are now widely used as structural materials. Their new\u000a      procedures incorporated built-in cross-checks to ensure the validity of\u000a      the test and analytical procedures. Blackman also developed crack-length\u000a      independent testing and analysis schemes for mode II (shear) fracture in\u000a      adhesive joints and in fibre-composites [4]. His research showed that\u000a      unacceptably variable results from the originally-proposed mode II test\u000a      were caused by (a) specimen clamping conditions and (b) complex\u000a      micro-cracking ahead of the mode II crack tip. By developing new\u000a      experimental calibration and adopting a novel `effective crack length'\u000a      approach, Blackman greatly improved the accuracy of the mode II test. Both\u000a      developments are embodied in ISO CD 15114 (2011).\u000a    The Failure of Plastic Pipes\u000a      Catastrophic failures by Rapid Crack Propagation (RCP) appeared soon after\u000a      polymers were first used for pressurised gas and water pipelines. The high\u000a      crack-speed and the hundreds of metres of RCP needed for the decompression\u000a      process to stabilise, make this failure extremely dangerous. Leevers' key\u000a      research [5] which underpins Standards to avoid RCP shows how suppressing\u000a      the pipe decompression process makes a meaningful laboratory-scale RCP\u000a      test method feasible. The `S4 Test', which Leevers invented, was\u000a      standardised in ISO 13477, and has become the industry Standard for design\u000a      against RCP. Deeper understanding of material properties which resist\u000a      fracture came with Leevers' `adiabatic decohesion' model. This attributes\u000a      RCP to a highly localised polymer-melting process: hugely significant\u000a      because plastic pipe materials owe most of their fracture resistance to a\u000a      layer at the free surface, where test temperature control is most\u000a      difficult. Leevers [6] showed how the earlier ISO 13477 Standard test\u000a      method had to be improved if the temperature sensitivity of this layer was\u000a      not to exert an over-optimistic influence on the test results. The changes\u000a      he proposed were implemented in ISO 13477 (2008).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42148","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Direct Economic\u000a    Corrosion costs the petrochemical industry about $12 bn pa at 1999 prices\u000a      [7] and it is essential to detect and manage it for the safe operation of\u000a      plant and to avoid environmental disasters such as leaking pipelines in\u000a      Alaska or subsea. Corrosion in pipe systems often happens at unpredictable\u000a      locations and conventional inspection techniques require scanning over the\u000a      whole surface to be inspected. Given the volume of pipes in service this\u000a      is impractical. The guided wave inspection system described above solves\u000a      this problem and makes it possible to do 100% screening of pipes that are\u000a      otherwise prohibitively expensive to inspect.\u000a    In 1999 a spin-out company Guided Ultrasonics Ltd was formed to\u000a      commercialise the technology under licence from Imperial Innovations, the\u000a      College technology transfer company. It now employs 7 PhD graduates in NDE\u000a      topics from Imperial with a total staff of 15 in UK. It sells equipment to\u000a      service inspection companies who do the inspection for the oil companies;\u000a      the equipment and examples of applications are given in [8, 9]. The\u000a      company has turned over &#163;32M in the REF period 2008-2013 as confirmed by\u000a      Operations Director, Guided Ultrasonics Ltd [B]. Imperial Innovations also\u000a      licenses the technology to a Welding Institute subsidiary company, Plant\u000a      Integrity Ltd, whose system is described in [10, 11]. This company has a\u000a      similar turnover so during the REF period the turnover from the technology\u000a      directly has been &gt;&#163;50M, over 80% of which is export [A].\u000a    The test systems last for 5-10 years and there are over 300 systems in\u000a      service worldwide; they are typically charged at &#163;2500\/day [B]. Assuming\u000a      50% utilisation, revenue to service inspection companies is ~&#163;75M pa and\u000a      over 300 FTE inspectors are employed (crew of 2 per inspection). The\u000a      income generated for the service inspection companies is therefore around\u000a      &#163;450M over the REF period.\u000a    End User - Economic and Safety\u000a    The benefit to the end user companies is reduced cost of inspection e.g.\u000a      pipes buried under roads - excavation for conventional inspection costs\u000a      upwards of &#163;80k [C]; insulated pipes - stripping and re-instating\u000a      insulation typically costs $100-2000\/m depending on whether scaffolding\u000a      etc. is required [B].\u000a    There are also significant safety benefits e.g.:\u000a    \u000a      Offshore risers - corrosion is most likely in the splash zone where\u000a        safe access for conventional inspection is expensive to ensure; in\u000a        contrast a guided wave test can be conducted from deck level where safe\u000a        access is easy to provide [C].\u000a      100% volume inspection coverage gives much better probability of\u000a        detecting severe, isolated defects than local inspection on a sampling\u000a        basis.\u000a      The technology also enables the end user companies to carry out more\u000a        inspection of critical, inaccessible lines and so improve safety and\u000a        environmental performance. An example of the use of the technology to\u000a        inspect an oil transmission pipeline crossing a swamp in Mexico is given\u000a        in [12]. The enhanced safety benefit is much more difficult to quantify\u000a        but is clearly substantial. The technique is mainly used in the\u000a        petrochemical industry but is also used in the power generation\u000a        (especially nuclear) and gas transmission sectors.\u000a    \u000a    Standards\u000a    Guided wave inspection has been recognised as a Method of NDE in its own\u000a      right, and its worldwide use has grown steadily to the point at which it\u000a      is appropriate to establish standards. This is important to ensure that\u000a      the method is used correctly, and also that its capabilities are not\u000a      over-sold, both vital ingredients to its long-term success. Professor Lowe\u000a      is leading the development of standards, working with standards bodies, in\u000a      close collaboration with Guided Ultrasonics Ltd and Plant Integrity Ltd.\u000a      The British Standard [13] explicitly cites [4] above and there are also\u000a      Italian [14], Japanese [15] and US [16] standards. Training of inspectors\u000a      is also crucial to the successful application of the technology and\u000a      certified training schemes are now in place e.g. PCN (UK), ASNT (USA),\u000a      RINA (Italy).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research led by Professors Cawley and Lowe (employed at Imperial College\u000a      over the whole 1993-2013 period) resulted in guided wave inspection being\u000a      established as a new non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method. It is used\u000a      worldwide to screen long lengths of pipework for corrosion, particularly\u000a      in the petrochemical industry. A spin-out company has been established\u000a      that employs seven PhD graduates in NDE from Imperial and the technology\u000a      is also licensed to another company.

Commercialisation of Guided Wave Inspection for the Detection of\u000a      Corrosion in Pipes\u000a    ","UKLocation":[],"UKRegion":[],"UOA":"Aeronautical, Mechanical, Chemical and Manufacturing Engineering","UnderpinningResearch":"\u000a    A major problem with conventional NDE techniques such as standard\u000a      ultrasonic testing is that they only interrogate the part of the test\u000a      structure directly beneath the transducer. This means that if a large\u000a      structure is to be inspected, either test times become extremely long, so\u000a      the inspection adds very significantly to operating costs, or the\u000a      reliability of inspection is compromised due to sparse sampling of the\u000a      local measurements. The problem can be overcome by using ultrasonic guided\u000a      waves which propagate along a structure and therefore enable a large area\u000a      to be inspected from a single transducer position, so giving 100% volume\u000a      coverage and large savings in inspection time. The difficulty with guided\u000a      wave inspection is that many guided wave modes exist (over 50 at 100 kHz\u000a      in a typical 6 inch diameter pipe) and, unless the excitation and\u000a      reception is carefully controlled, the received signals are too\u000a      complicated to be interpretable. Understanding the modes and then\u000a      investigating methods to control them was the first research task. The\u000a      background research on the guided wave inspection of pipes started in the\u000a      early 1990s and the main development was carried out under the CEC Thermie\u000a      programme starting in 1994. This initial work was supervised by Professor\u000a      Cawley.\u000a    Of the 50+ guided wave modes in a typical 6 inch diameter pipe at 100\u000a      kHz, only three are axially symmetric so the initial research led to a\u000a      decision to excite only axially symmetric modes; two of these modes are\u000a      longitudinal and one is torsional, and these mode types are not coupled so\u000a      excitation in the circumferential direction will only excite torsional\u000a      modes and excitation in the axial direction will only excite longitudinal\u000a      modes. Excitation can efficiently be provided by an array of nominally\u000a      identical transducers around the pipe, each transducer forcing in the\u000a      required direction. This concept, together with a novel transducer design\u000a      is the subject of the key underpinning patent [1] (authors Professor\u000a      Cawley and RAs working on the project). The next step was to show how the\u000a      chosen modes interact with defects, and the key initial study of this is\u000a      reported in [2]; this was jointly supervised by Professors Cawley and Lowe\u000a      in the mid-1990s.\u000a    A simple reflection measurement in an axially symmetric mode cannot\u000a      distinguish between a benign, axially symmetric reflector such as a butt\u000a      weld, and a corrosion patch that will typically be non-symmetric. We then\u000a      showed that a symmetric feature will only reflect the incoming symmetric\u000a      mode, whereas a non-symmetric feature will reflect both the incident\u000a      axisymmetric mode and non-symmetric modes generated by mode conversion.\u000a      The output of the individual transducers in the array can be processed to\u000a      give both the symmetric and non-symmetric reflected modes and this,\u000a      together with the relative amplitudes of the key modes for different\u000a      circumferential extents of defects, is described in [3], a companion paper\u000a      to [2]. A guide to using the relative amplitudes of the different\u000a      reflections to diagnose corrosion is given in [4] and this is the\u000a      procedure used commercially; again this work was jointly supervised by\u000a      Professors Cawley and Lowe in the early 2000s. Further recent work [5]\u000a      supervised by Professor Cawley has shown that the output of the transducer\u000a      array can be processed to give a full unwrapped image of the pipe, so both\u000a      the axial and circumferential location of defects is obtained, together\u000a      with an indication of the lateral and axial extents of the defect; this is\u000a      now implemented in the commercial product.\u000a    Pipes are frequently coated with highly viscoelastic materials such as\u000a      bitumen to provide corrosion protection, so it is necessary to understand\u000a      the influence of this on the wave propagation; a key fundamental study of\u000a      this effect is given in [6] and informs the guidelines used for testing\u000a      coated pipes. This work was supervised by Professor Cawley between\u000a      2000-2004.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42149","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As well as supporting the Imperial research and attracting substantial\u000a      funding from industry, the new test methods have also been commercialised\u000a      by a spin-out company, now known as PCS Instruments Ltd, (www.pcs-instruments.com).\u000a      Over the period 2008-13 (6 yr) it had a turnover of &#163;39.8M (&#163;7.63M in\u000a      2012-13), with 80% overseas sales, and now employs five Imperial Tribology\u000a      PhD graduates, one of whom was recruited since 2008. There are a total of\u000a      11 permanent staff in the company. All the manufacturing added value\u000a      associated with the company is in the UK; thus the company supports a\u000a      range of subcontractors.\u000a    The main test rigs sold by PCS that were developed as a result of\u000a      Imperial research are:\u000a    \u000a      Elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (\"EHL\" or \"Ultra\") rig, (Ultra-thin\u000a        lubricant film thickness measurement to 1 nm [2])\u000a      High frequency reciprocating rig, HFRR (friction and wear tester,\u000a        additive development, international standard for fuel lubricity [8, 9])\u000a      EHL Spacer layer interferometry rig, SLIM (Film thickness distribution\u000a        to 5 nm) [1]\u000a      Mini-traction machine, MTM (Friction in rolling-sliding contact, basis\u000a        of low efficiency oil formulation [4])\u000a      Micro-pitting rig, MPR (Micro-pitting, fatigue, durability and\u000a        friction at high pressure) [6]\u000a    \u000a    The total number of rigs sold is 1300, of which 764 were sold between Jan\u000a      2008 and July 2013, as confirmed by the CEO of PCS Instruments Ltd [C].\u000a    The development and commercialisation of these test methods has made an\u000a      impact in two significant areas: (a) their almost universal application in\u000a      the global lubricants industry where they have become essential tools for\u000a      the development of lubricant formulations and where they form the basis of\u000a      a number of international standards [7-9] and (b) the widespread adoption\u000a      of the techniques in the research community.\u000a    The most significant beneficiary has been the global lubricants industry\u000a      and its customers. This includes lubricant manufacturers (major\u000a      oil companies such as BP, ExxonMobil [10, 11], Shell, Petronas, Sinopec;\u000a      and specialist suppliers such as Valvoline [12] and Syntech, together with\u000a      global additive suppliers such as Lubrizol, Evonik [13], Infineum\u000a      [14], Afton and Chevron Oronite. Around 38.5M (2006) tons of lubricants\u000a      are manufactured annually and the global market has been estimated to have\u000a      a value of nearly $50bn in 2012 [17]. Vice President Global Commercial\u000a      Technology [A] for Shell says: \"... lubricant test machines from\u000a        PCS-Instruments have become the tools of choice for lubricant\u000a        development in almost all oil and additive companies around the world,\u000a        including my own.\"\u000a    Senior Vice-President of Research and Development [B] , Valvoline,\u000a      confirms this view: \"In the last decade, the new generation of\u000a        lubricant test equipment developed by PCS Instruments (MTM, HFRR, EHL\u000a        film thickness etc.) has led to a striking change in the way that we\u000a        design and test lubricants. We now depend on PCS test equipment to\u000a        develop formulations for our automotive engine and drivetrain lubricants\u000a        at Valvoline and we consider them to be an essential tool for early\u000a        assessment of lubricant parameters governing efficiency and durability.\u000a        We currently have four PCS test rigs (one EHL, one HFRR, and two MTMs)\u000a        in our New Product Development Centre in Lexington, Kentucky.\"\u000a    In the period 2008-2012, MTM and HFRR test rigs were cited in 380 US\u000a      patent applications and in 113 granted US patents, highlighting its\u000a      importance in specifying these new materials. PCS test rigs have also been\u000a      sold to 41 University research groups world-wide, making them one of the\u000a      most widely-used categories of equipment in tribology research\u000a      laboratories. The technical literature in experimental tribology is\u000a      dominated by work on PCS rigs, especially the MTM [14-16].\u000a    The value of the techniques developed and their impact has been greatly\u000a      enhanced by the growing concern by the public and by governments worldwide\u000a      to protect the environment. This has led to changes in lubricant design,\u000a      primarily to reduce friction and thus reduce fuel consumption and hence CO2\u000a      emissions, but also to provide engine lubricants that maintain durability\u000a      and are compatible with vehicle exhaust after-treatment systems.\u000a    Examples include [10], which patents the addition of high viscosity\u000a      esters to hydrocarbon oils to increase low speed film thickness and reduce\u000a      friction. It used the \"Ultra\" technique and is based directly on [2].\u000a      Another is [13], one of many such patents by Evonik concerning the use of\u000a      functionalised polymers to produce low friction engine\/transmission oils.\u000a      This work is based on the MTM test method and is a consequence of the\u000a      research described in [3].\u000a    The best passenger car engine lubricants are currently about 4-5% more\u000a      efficient than their early 1990s counterparts as a result of lubricant\u000a      development based to a large degree on Imperial\/PCS test methods. This\u000a      increase in efficiency corresponds to an annual reduction of nearly 4&#215;41010\u000a      kg (about 0.1%) of global man-made CO2 emissions.

These are solid or fluid layers, of thickness\u000a      in the range 1 to 100 nm, formed on rubbing surfaces in lubricated\u000a      contacts. The ability to create and measure such films, under controlled\u000a      conditions, has led to a significant advance in the understanding of\u000a      lubrication and, in particular, of the mechanisms by which lubricant\u000a      additives operate. The techniques form the basis of modern experimental\u000a      Tribology and are used extensively both for the development of practical\u000a      lubricants and for fundamental research. A series of instruments based on\u000a      the techniques developed at the College has been commercialised by a\u000a      spinout company, PCS Instruments Ltd.\u000a    The approach is based upon measuring in situ, within rubbing\u000a      lubricated contacts, the thickness (typically less than 100 nanometres),\u000a      chemical composition and temperature of lubricant films between rubbing\u000a      surfaces whilst controlling the conditions that generate and destroy such\u000a      films, e.g. by independently varying the sliding speed and entrainment\u000a      speed [1-4]. These techniques have greatly advanced the understanding of\u000a      the nature and properties of boundary lubricating films.\u000a    A method for accurately measuring the thickness of boundary films was\u000a      developed (the optical, ultra-thin film thickness technique, \"Ultra\") and\u000a      this was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of polymer absorption as a\u000a      boundary lubrication mechanism [2]. A variant of this, the \"spacer layer\u000a      interferometry method, SLIM\", was devised to map the thickness of the film\u000a      over the whole area of contact. These techniques exploited recent optical\u000a      technology to measure and to image, for the first time, in-situ lubricant\u000a      films that had a thickness as low as 1\/500th of the wavelength of light.\u000a    Another technique was devised to simultaneously measure friction and film\u000a      formation over a range of controlled conditions (the \"mini-traction\u000a      machine, MTM\" and interferometric attachment, \"MTM\/SLIM\" [3]). The MTM\u000a      utilises precision numerical control to generate repeatable surface speeds\u000a      and loads so that friction forces under known shear rates were accessible\u000a      for the first time. The techniques were used, for example, to explore the\u000a      kinetics of anti-wear film formation and to show the impact of such films\u000a      on friction [3]. These two techniques were used together to show that\u000a      molecules of different polarity within a lubricant blend, fractionate\u000a      close to polar surfaces. The fractionation process can be exploited to\u000a      control film generation and friction [4].\u000a    The techniques enabled the thickness and properties of friction-reducing\u000a      additive films within rubbing contacts to be directly revealed for the\u000a      first time [5]. The research has subsequently been employed by industry in\u000a      the design of low friction, energy efficient lubricants, as described in\u000a      section 4.\u000a    In parallel to in-situ lubricant measurement methods, the team\u000a      developed techniques for the study of surface damage. One technique was\u000a      the high-frequency reciprocating \"HFRR\" wear test, in which a test ball is\u000a      vibrated electrically at high speed to produce sliding wear in the\u000a      boundary regime. The method specifically generates a high repetition rate\u000a      with a low surface speed, ensuring the contact remains in the boundary\u000a      regime and at a controlled temperature.\u000a    Another is the \"MPR\" [6] technique for studying rolling contact fatigue\u000a      phenomena using a triple-contact roller configuration. This rig is\u000a      uniquely able to generate surface stress cycles rapidly (typically 106\u000a      per hour) without using high surface speeds, so that fatigue behaviour\u000a      over a wide range of film thicknesses can be studied within a reasonable\u000a      time-scale. HFRR and MPR rigs have been used to demonstrate and exploit\u000a      the relationship between lubricant composition, film formation and\u000a      component durability. An example is the detrimental effect of some\u000a      anti-wear formulations on micropitting resistance, shown to be due to\u000a      surface topography effects, and their mitigation by friction modifiers\u000a      [6].\u000a    The combination of these techniques has enabled an improved linkage\u000a      between measurements of the performance of lubricants in simple laboratory\u000a      tests and prediction of behaviour in real equipment such as engines and\u000a      mechanical transmission systems. This has led to their widespread use in\u000a      industry for the development of lubricant formulations as described in\u000a      section 4.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42150","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The problem of Vibration\u000a      Excessive vibration in gas turbine components can lead to failure due to\u000a      high cycle fatigue (HCF).\u000a      In extreme cases, it can lead to loss of the aircraft, such as the\u000a      Kegworth Air Disaster [7] in 1989 in\u000a      which 47 people lost their lives and the financial cost ran into tens of\u000a      millions of pounds. The failure\u000a      was caused by flutter (fluid-structure interaction) of the fan at high\u000a      engine speed due to a change in\u000a      the non-linear dynamic properties of the part-span shroud.\u000a    More typically a turbine or compressor blade may be released which causes\u000a      difficulty for operators\u000a      of civil and military engines because they require predictable\u000a      availability in which all engine\u000a      problems can be managed through scheduled maintenance. However, HCF can\u000a      lead to sudden,\u000a      unexpected component failure which can be very disruptive and expensive\u000a      (e.g. additional aircraft\u000a      and crew, ferrying damaged engine to base + cost of repair). For ground\u000a      based gas turbines, used\u000a      for gas\/oil pumping or electricity generation, then the financial cost can\u000a      be very high through lack of\u000a      revenue, and the remote location of the units (e.g. on an oil platform)\u000a      adds to the maintenance\u000a      difficulties. The US Air Force reported that 56% of its \"Class A\" engine\u000a      related mishaps were due to\u000a      HCF, requiring an expenditure of 850,000 maintenance man-hours for risk\u000a      management\u000a      inspections, with the total cost of HCF being quoted as $400 million per\u000a      year [8].\u000a    The Impact of the Vibration UTC\u000a      The Vibration UTC is a strategic partner of Rolls-Royce for the\u000a      development of a prediction\u000a      capability for vibration [9]. The research programmes completed by the\u000a      Vibration UTC are\u000a      delivered as fundamental investigations of behaviour, processes for\u000a      prediction, software modules\u000a      and supporting measurements. By controlling the vibration behaviour the\u000a      risk of High Cycle Fatigue\u000a      is dramatically reduced. The delivery of the impact is also assisted by\u000a      consultancy undertaken by\u000a      the academic staff and by PhD graduates and postdocs being employed by the\u000a      company; 10 UTC\u000a      researchers have joined Rolls-Royce since 1996, including 3 since 2008.\u000a    Fluid-Structure Interaction\u000a      The research on fluid-structure interaction has revolutionised the\u000a      approach to predicting the\u000a      vibration behaviour and is in routine use at Rolls-Royce across the major\u000a      sites throughout the\u000a      world. This was confirmed in a keynote lecture given by Dr M. Goulette\u000a      (then Director of Rolls-\u000a      Royce Engineering Systems) at the International Symposium on Unsteady\u000a      Aerodynamics,\u000a      Aeroacoustics and Aeroelasticity of Turbomachines in London during\u000a      September 2009 [A].\u000a      Processes and software (AU3D\/JM62) developed by the Vibration UTC have\u000a      been applied to the\u000a      design of the majority of Rolls-Royce civil &amp; military aero-engines,\u000a      including:\u000a    \u000a      All versions of theTrent family for the large civil engine market\u000a        since the early 1990s (i.e\u000a        Trent 700 \/ 800 \/ 500 \/ 900 \/ 1000 \/ XWB).\u000a      BR710 \/ BR725 \/ V2500 \/ AE3007 for the small civil \/ corporate market.\u000a      Main engine and LiftFan for the Joint Strike Fighter, TP400 for the\u000a        A400M transporter,\u000a        Pegasus for the vertical take-off Harrier and AV8-B.\u000a    \u000a    Through these engine programmes, the process and tools developed at\u000a      Imperial have enabled\u000a      improvement in reliability against tightening constraints on engine cost,\u000a      weight, noise and\u000a      performance, leading to savings. Designers tend to compromise the design\u000a      due to unquantified\u000a      concerns about HCF failure, but the research has enabled better\u000a      understanding of the design\u000a      space and allowed improved engine performance. [A] states, \"The\u000a      understanding and tools\u000a      developed by the VUTC have enabled improved efficiency of fan system of\u000a      Trent XWB by around\u000a      0.1%, which is equivalent to a saving of &#163;100 million in fuel costs alone\u000a      over the lifetime of the\u000a      fleet. It has also enabled integrity assessment of damage cases such as\u000a      bird impact and novel\u000a      engine architectures such as the Lift Fan used in the F-35B Joint Strike\u000a      Fighter\".\u000a    One very tangible benefit is the significant reduction in cost of testing\u000a      because the analysis\u000a      procedures (and software) are used to replace engine testing. Testing on\u000a      rotating parts requires\u000a      expensive engine telemetry experiments and can cost in the order of\u000a      &#163;1million per test, therefore\u000a      the research has directly led to the saving of several millions of pounds\u000a      per engine programme. [C]\u000a      states, \"AU3D has revolutionised the way Rolls-Royce assesses the\u000a      mechanical integrity of\u000a      compressor aerofoils. The code is in routine use within the company and\u000a      with the support of the\u000a      VUTC, has led to a factor of 5 reduction in test costs, a total saving of\u000a      around &#163;30M over the last\u000a      five years for the Trent programme alone\". It is also now successfully\u000a      deployed for the corporate jet\u000a      market via Rolls-Royce Deutschland and is already making large savings\u000a      [D].\u000a    Structural Dynamics\u000a      Work on modelling of non-linear contact and friction has improved the\u000a      understanding of the\u000a      influence of contact on the vibration characteristics and the mechanical\u000a      damping of the system.\u000a      The early focus (1998-2005) was on behaviour of turbine \"under-platform\"\u000a      dampers to reduce\u000a      vibration levels and prevent high cycle fatigue failures.(Note: these\u000a      blades are about 100mm long,\u000a      produce ~800 HP, operate in gas flow several hundred Celsius above the\u000a      material melting point\u000a      and operate for millions of miles). Turbine failures in service create\u000a      costs running into millions of\u000a      pounds due to repair and warrantee payments and claims due to flight\u000a      schedule disruption. There\u000a      were problems in the 1990's which led to the introduction of a design\u000a      change [10]. According to [B],\u000a      \"Rolls-Royce have routinely used JM62 for optimisation of the turbine\u000a      blade damper system to\u000a      control vibration and we have seen blade HCF failures reduce to virtually\u000a      zero giving savings of\u000a      tens of millions of pounds over the past five years\".\u000a    Engine Design Capability\u000a      The Engine Design aspects are still at an early stage of deployment, but\u000a      there are already\u000a      programmes in place to transfer the developed methods into Rolls-Royce.\u000a      The preliminary\u000a      geometry generation tools are planned to become an integral part of the\u000a      Rolls-Royce design\u000a      system, allowing more rapid and broader studies of new engine\u000a      architectures which are expected\u000a      to give a better performance, reduced weight and cost. The low order\u000a      modelling tools will also be\u000a      used to identify vibration problems (and solutions) at an early stage in\u000a      the design phase leading to\u000a      significant savings in engine design and development costs.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Cost savings in the order of &#163;130M over the REF period have been achieved\u000a      by Rolls-Royce\u000a      through the improvement of engine reliability of civil and military\u000a      aero-engines, industrial machines\u000a      used for electricity generation and gas\/oil pumping applications through\u000a      the use of techniques and\u000a      processes developed by the Vibration University Technology Centre (UTC) at\u000a      Imperial College\u000a      London.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    Imperial College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Imperial College London","InstitutionName":"Imperial College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003270}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    * References that best indicate quality of underpinning research.\u000a    \u000a[1] M.

The underpinning research is organised in three inter-related\u000a      themes (a) fluid-structure\u000a      interaction (b) structural dynamics, and (c) engine design capability.\u000a    Fluid-Structure Interaction\u000a      The development of the fluid-structure interaction capability was led by\u000a      Prof M. Imregun throughout\u000a      the period from 1993 until 2010. The main research challenges were to\u000a      understand and predict the\u000a      complex vibration mechanisms which can occur within a gas turbine due to\u000a      the air flow. An\u000a      example of this is flutter of fan blades in which the blade motion causes\u000a      aerodynamic changes\u000a      which in turn affect the structural response [1]. The system behaviour is\u000a      also influenced by\u000a      interaction with the engine intake flow, including the wind conditions on\u000a      the ground, and is known\u000a      to vary from assembly to assembly for nominally identical fan sets. Other\u000a      examples are the\u000a      aerodynamic instability issues causing rotating stall and surge, which can\u000a      lead to unacceptably\u000a      high loads on gas turbine components. Forced vibration of compressor and\u000a      turbine blades due to\u000a      the aerodynamic unsteadiness from adjacent rows of blades is also a\u000a      critical issue for design [2].\u000a    A new software based methodology (known as AU3D) was developed to model\u000a      details of the\u000a      interaction between the air flow and the structure. It calculates the\u000a      instantaneous state of the fluid\u000a      and structure and allows each to interact as the solution proceeds [3].\u000a      The approach, based on\u000a      state-of-the-art unsteady compressible flow and structural dynamics was\u000a      initially developed by Dr\u000a      M. Vahdati (Senior Research Fellow and in the group from1993 to the\u000a      present) and has continued\u000a      to be developed and be applied with contributions from many other\u000a      researchers within the VUTC.\u000a      The approach has been transferred to Rolls-Royce and is used largely in\u000a      the form supplied by\u000a      Imperial.\u000a    Structural Dynamics\u000a      Understanding the structural dynamic behaviour is critical to predicting\u000a      the material component\u000a      integrity.\u000a    A team formed by Prof David Ewins (in post 1993-present; now a member of\u000a      the Rolls-Royce\u000a      Manufacturing, Materials and Structures Advisory Board) has focussed on\u000a      non-linear contact and\u000a      friction and their effect on overall system response (here system refers\u000a      to the set of components in\u000a      a turbine or compressor stage). A unique prediction method (JM62) has been\u000a      developed to model\u000a      structural interfaces with emphasis on the overall dynamic response [4]\u000a      rather than the tribology of\u000a      the contact. The approach has been transferred to Rolls-Royce and is in\u000a      wide use, with frequent\u000a      interaction on refinements and new features. Since 2011 the team is headed\u000a      by Dr Christoph\u000a      Schwingshackl (Lecturer since 2011).\u000a    As an example, the High Pressure Turbine rotor is subject to very large\u000a      unsteady gas loads and\u000a      the vibration is controlled by use of a friction damper. The research has\u000a      involved detailed\u000a      investigation of the behaviour of such dampers, including extensive\u000a      analysis supported by\u000a      experimental system level testing [5] for validation and development of a\u000a      friction measurement rig\u000a      to determine the contact parameters at high frequency.\u000a    Engine Design Capability\u000a      The objective of the gas turbine design and analysis system (\"Virtual\u000a      Engine\") is to provide detailed\u000a      assessments of preliminary engine configurations at an early stage in the\u000a      design process. The\u000a      team was launched in 2005 and is headed by Dr Luca di Mare (Lecturer since\u000a      2011) and has\u000a      developed a completely novel approach to gas-turbine design which includes\u000a      the close linking of\u000a      low-order modelling of physical effects adapted to the stage of the design\u000a      process. There is a very\u000a      close link between geometry and associated data in a unified approach\u000a      enabling \"water tight\"\u000a      geometry extraction to enable robust analysis of the aerodynamics\u000a      performance and mechanical\u000a      integrity of the machine [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42151","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This case study concerns the impact of Imperial College research since\u000a      1993 on the CFD codes\u000a      marketed by CD-adapco. The company has grown steadily over this period;\u000a      its turnover has grown\u000a      more than 30 fold since 1993 and by over 250% since 2008 to currently ~\u000a      $190M pa [A]. Its\u000a      principal offices are located in London, Nuremburg and New York and it has\u000a      numerous worldwide\u000a      sales offices, for example in France, Germany, Italy, USA, Japan, Korea,\u000a      China, India, Brazil and\u000a      Russia. It employs nearly 750 staff of whom roughly 80 are located in the\u000a      London office. The\u000a      company won a Queen's award for exports in 1997. The impact of CD-adapco's\u000a      CFD products\u000a      STAR-CD and STAR-CCM+ is wide-ranging and of considerable benefit to UK\u000a      and worldwide\u000a      industries, by improving competitiveness via substantially reducing the\u000a      costs and time for product\u000a      development and enabling innovative design. Indeed, one of the key selling\u000a      points of these\u000a      products is the ability to offer a substantial return on investment\u000a      through these savings.\u000a    STAR-CD, the original general-purpose code is now a bespoke internal\u000a      combustion engine\u000a      simulator, where it is undoubtedly the world `number one'. It is used by\u000a      most major manufacturers\u000a      including Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Fiat, GM, Jaguar Land Rover, Hyundai,\u000a      Lotus, Mercedes, Nissan,\u000a      Renault, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo e.g. [7]. Mercedes, Ferrari and\u000a      Renault also use it\u000a      extensively in Formula 1 for engine design. Successful though this product\u000a      was, it became\u000a      apparent in the late 1990s that due to its age and architecture it was not\u000a      a suitable platform to\u000a      accommodate the improvements and expansions into new application areas\u000a      that CD-adapco\u000a      wished to make and also to exploit recent research advances at Imperial.\u000a      Accordingly, it was\u000a      decided to develop an entirely new general-purpose code, STAR-CCM+; and to\u000a      specialise STAR-CD\u000a      for reciprocating engine applications.\u000a    STAR-CCM+, first released in 2004, is the company's current flagship\u000a      general-purpose CFD code,\u000a      that also has electromagnetic, electrochemical and stress analysis\u000a      capabilities. It is employed\u000a      worldwide by a large number of companies in a very wide range of\u000a      industries, e.g. aerospace\u000a      (airplanes, rockets, UAVs [8 ]and [9], batteries\/battery-powered equipment\u000a      [10], chemical process,\u000a      defence, food processing [11], fossil-fuelled and renewable (nuclear [13]\u000a      and wind\/solar) energy,\u000a      electronics cooling [13], ground transportation (cars [12], trucks,\u000a      trains), marine (ships, offshore\u000a      structures [15], oil\/gas production and processing [16], pharmaceutical,\u000a      etc. The CFD software\u000a      market is extremely competitive and there is a continuing need to develop\u000a      more powerful and\u000a      flexible numerical solution techniques and new and improved models for a\u000a      variety of physical\u000a      phenomena. Developments in these areas at Imperial have assisted in\u000a      CD-adapco maintaining a\u000a      competitive edge throughout the lifetime of the company. This has been\u000a      particularly true during the\u000a      past two decades of rapid growth, due to the following:\u000a    \u000a      Implementation in both codes of the unstructured mesh methodology,\u000a        including the\u000a        associated numerical solver extensions [1, 2]. These have endowed both\u000a        STAR-CD and\u000a        STAR-CCM+ with fast transient solution and unique and powerful\u000a        complex-geometry-handling\u000a        capabilities that, when combined with automatic mesh generation\u000a        methodology\u000a        developed by the company, offer decisive advantages over the competition\u000a        in terms of\u000a        speed, capability and ease of use. In particular, it is no longer\u000a        necessary, as in other codes,\u000a        to simplify complex geometries in order to mesh and perform a CFD flow\u000a        solution; and the\u000a        mesh generation times are typically faster by an order of magnitude.\u000a        Examples of the\u000a        degrees of complexity that can be handled are shown in [3], [8], [12]\u000a        and [13]. The additional\u000a        benefits to STAR-CD of improvements of engine physics modelling at\u000a        Imperial are described\u000a        and illustrated in [4] and [7].\u000a      Exploitation in producing the new-generation STAR-CCM+, of the proven\u000a        advantages\u000a        described in Ref 6 of the object-oriented C++ programming language. The\u000a        first version of\u000a        this code was released in 2004. In addition to the benefits of being\u000a        easier to develop and\u000a        maintain, the object-oriented architecture has facilitated the\u000a        introduction of some novel\u000a        features including multi-physics and CAD-to-results capabilities. The\u000a        former comprises\u000a        additional solid stress, electrochemistry [10] and electromagnetic\u000a        solvers, which can be\u000a        applied either individually or in a fully-coupled fashion with one or\u000a        more of the others &#8212; for\u000a        example, to perform fluid\/structure stress and\/or thermal interaction\u000a        simulations. The latter\u000a        feature refers to the ability of STAR-CCM+ to: (a) import or generate,\u000a        using an internal solid\u000a        modeller, a CAD description of the application geometry; (b) repair any\u000a        defects in the\u000a        description and isolate the fluid volume on which the analysis is to be\u000a        performed; (c)\u000a        automatically mesh this volume; (d) perform the required CFD and\/or\u000a        other physics analysis;\u000a        and (e) manipulate, display and output the results in the desired form.\u000a        Example applications\u000a        are shown in [3], [8], [12] and [13] among others. STAR-CCM+ is unique\u000a        in offering these\u000a        features in a single code, as compared with the multiple code offerings\u000a        of other CFD\u000a        companies.\u000a      Implementation in both codes of the multiphase flow methodology\u000a        developed at Imperial,\u000a        notably the free surface capturing technique [5] which has been\u000a        particularly attractive to the\u000a        marine and oil and gas industries, the former for ship design and the\u000a        latter for offshore\u000a        structures [15], pipelines and separation equipment [16].\u000a    \u000a    The growth outlined above means that since 2008 there has been\u000a      significant on-going impact\u000a      underpinned by the research. The benefits of all of these developments are\u000a      collectively reflected in\u000a      the general-purpose STAR-CCM+ code, which has attracted favourable\u000a      comments from many\u000a      users. For example, in relation to the unstructured mesh and expanded\u000a      modelling features, the\u000a      Chief Engineer at Atkins [B], one of the world's leading design,\u000a      engineering and project\u000a      management consultancies, states that: \"The powerful geometry-handling\u000a        capabilities of STAR-CCM+,\u000a        together with its wide range of physics models, make it an ideal tool\u000a        for the diverse\u000a        applications we have to deal with.\" These same features, together\u000a      with the all in one CAD-to-results\u000a      architecture facilitated due the use of C++, have been especially valued\u000a      by the automotive\u000a      community, where in a number of application areas they have enabled\u000a      testing to be substantially\u000a      reduced or even replaced by simulation, as reflected in the following\u000a      remarks by Suwhan Kim, a\u000a      senior engineer at Hyundai Motor Corporation in South Korea:\"The\u000a        automation of underhood\u000a        cooling performance analysis is a breakthrough in the field of automated\u000a        systems. At Hyundai,\u000a        thermal flow design engineers are very satisfied with the module\u000a        [STAR-CCM+]. It has allowed\u000a        them to cut down the preparation and design time by about 70%, and has\u000a        shown no particular\u000a        difficulty in simulating the overall cooling performance for the diverse\u000a        range of Hyundai-Kia\u000a        automobile models.\" [17].\u000a    In Formula 1 where speed of turnaround is also important, the Head of CFD\u000a      at Lotus Renault GP\u000a      Limited [C] comments: \"The first thing that separates CD-adapco from\u000a        the competition is STAR-CCM+:\u000a        it's a state-of-the-art CFD code and since we introduced it we have\u000a        managed to massively\u000a        increase our simulation throughput. STAR-CCM+ is a massive step forward.\u000a        The code itself is fast,\u000a        robust and extremely easy to use so people new to the software can pick\u000a        it up very quickly.\"\u000a    It is also particularly noteworthy that over the past 5 years the\u000a      CD-adapco group turnover has\u000a      increased by more than 15% per annum, a remarkable achievement in times of\u000a      economic hardship\u000a      and directly attributable to the substantial and proven return on\u000a      investment which CD-adapco\u000a      products offer, due to their unique features.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Computational Dynamics Ltd, partnering with adapco and trading as\u000a      CD-adapco www.cd-adapco.com\u000a      is the world's largest independent CFD-focused provider of engineering\u000a      simulation\u000a      software, with major products STAR-CD and STAR-CCM+.

The company's first\u000a      product was STAR-CD,\u000a      produced in 1987 and largely based on CFD technologies developed at\u000a      Imperial. Some of the key\u000a      early features were: body-fitted and moving meshes, implicit solution\u000a      finite-volume solution\u000a      algorithms and liquid fuel spray, turbulent combustion and radiation heat\u000a      transfer models. Elements\u000a      of this technology were also subsequently adopted by the other major CFD\u000a      companies. This case\u000a          study is solely concerned with code developments based on Imperial\u000a          research post 1993.\u000a    Imperial research was a vital input to the company in the post-1993\u000a      period, the key academic staff\u000a      involved being Professor Gosman and Dr Issa. Professor Gosman was on the\u000a      full time academic\u000a      staff from pre-1993 until 2004; he was then half time for 18 months, since\u000a      when he was a senior\u000a      research investigator paid an honorarium until 2008 and then a\u000a      distinguished research fellow\u000a      (unpaid, but regularly in the department) to the present. Dr Issa was on\u000a      the full time staff from\u000a      1993-2003 and has been a senior research investigator paid an honorarium\u000a      since then. Particularly\u000a      important developments occurred in the post-1993 period, the most\u000a      significant of which was the\u000a      unstructured-mesh methodology [1] that is applied in both the STAR-CD and\u000a      the newer STAR-CCM+\u000a      code. This was a key enabler for addressing the full geometrical\u000a      complexities of real\u000a      industrial applications using automatic meshing techniques developed\u000a      within the company and\u000a      provided a significant competitive advantage. Further benefits were gained\u000a      from the adaptation\u000a      within this framework of the highly efficient PISO algorithm [2], which\u000a      was particularly\u000a      advantageous for unsteady flow applications. An overview of these and\u000a      other novel developments\u000a      is given in [3]. [4] describes the outcomes of a systematic programme of\u000a      research at Imperial on\u000a      the prediction of reciprocating engine combustion, including, post-1993,\u000a      the introduction of moving\u000a      unstructured meshes and advanced modelling of the processes of: fuel spray\u000a      injection, wall\u000a      impingement and wall film formation, spark and compression ignition, and\u000a      petrol and Diesel\u000a      combustion and pollutant emissions. This work has contributed to STAR-CD's\u000a      reputation as the\u000a      leading CFD code for engine simulation. Multiphase flow modelling was\u000a      another Imperial research\u000a      area and Ref 5 presents a powerful method for multiphase flow simulation\u000a      allowing resolution of\u000a      the phase interface topology, which has provided another competitive edge\u000a      for both STAR-CD and\u000a      STAR-CCM+.\u000a    A separate, unique and important strand of research during this period,\u000a      described in Ref 6, looked\u000a      at the viability of using an object-oriented programming language, C++,\u000a      for CFD and other CAE\u000a      applications. There were well-known advantages with this in terms of ease,\u000a      reliability and flexibility\u000a      of programming, but concerns about possible substantial computing time\u000a      penalties relative to the\u000a      widely-used FORTRAN language. A research C++ code called FOAM was written\u000a      and tests\u000a      demonstrated that if best practices were used, no appreciable time\u000a      penalties occurred. This led\u000a      directly to the use of C++ in the production of the new flagship product\u000a      STAR-CCM+, with\u000a      attendant benefits.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42152","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"285570","Name":"Kuwait"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Codes developed from the research have been used commercially, both\u000a      directly and in modified form.

This has contributed significantly to the rapid growth of\u000a        digital rock services in the petroleum industry.\"\u000a    iRock Technologies is a start-up company, based in Beijing, that exploits\u000a      the technology developed at Imperial College. The CEO is Dr Hu Dong, a\u000a      former researcher in Prof Blunt's research group at Imperial, while Prof\u000a      Blunt himself is Chief Scientist. To quote from their website: \"iRock\u000a        Technologies provides digital special core analysis (SCAL) software and\u000a        services to national and international oil companies. We leverage years\u000a        of research from the Imperial College Consortium on Pore Scale Modeling\u000a        to provide comprehensive reservoir insights that can affordably improve\u000a        recovery factor for oil and gas companies worldwide.\" iRock\u000a      Technologies works with the China National Petroleum Corporation and other\u000a      major companies to assess conventional and unconventional (shale)\u000a      hydrocarbon reservoirs. The company was founded in 2010 and employs 20\u000a      people with an annual turnover of more than $4 million [B].\u000a    The methods have also been used directly internally in several major oil\u000a      and service companies, including Chevron, KOC (Kuwait), Shell, BG and\u000a      Schlumberger. The research continues with total current industrial funding\u000a      of &#163;220,000 per year from Total [C], Petrobras, JOGMEC, Statoil and BG.\u000a    The research has been applied to predict flow properties in hydrocarbon\u000a      reservoirs that are difficult or impossible to measure directly. It allows\u000a      a much more detailed and accurate characterization of oil, water and gas\u000a      flow, allowing better design of oil and gas recovery. This has resulted in\u000a      savings in operating costs and additional hydrocarbon recovery, and helped\u000a      inform management decisions for oilfield development [C]. In addition, the\u000a      technology is now being used to appraise unconventional resources, such as\u000a      shale gas [B].\u000a    One example of the use of this technology, reported in the Society of\u000a      Petroleum Engineers conference proceedings, paper SPE 163331, [D] was to\u000a      manage the pressure decline in a large oil reservoir (Marratt) in the\u000a      Middle East, operated by KOC (Kuwait Oil Company) while avoiding problems\u000a      associated with the precipitation of asphaltenes (tar-like components of\u000a      the oil that restrict flow). The use of digital rock technology led to\u000a        savings of over $25 million in the cost of production operations to KOC,\u000a        and boosted recovery by 10 million barrels (worth around $100 million).\u000a      The same ideas are now being applied the world's largest sandstone\u000a      reservoir (Greater Burgan; the second largest oilfield in the world)\u000a      operated by the same company [E]. This is just one of dozens of uses of\u000a      the technology worldwide: these were discussed, for instance, at the 2013\u000a      Annual Symposium of the Society of Core Analysts [F].\u000a    As other examples, the Principal Reservoir Engineer at Shell confirms\u000a      savings of \"$3-4 million\" for just for one reservoir alone using\u000a      this technology and points to recovery improvements of around 500 million\u000a      barrels for transition zone carbonate reservoirs, which are difficult to\u000a      describe and manage using conventional technology [G].\u000a    A senior Petrophysicist at BG also points to recovery improvements in\u000a      this type of reservoir and cites our work on the Panna field (offshore\u000a      India) as an example of the use of the technology: he presented this case\u000a      study to engineers in Brazil in May 2012 [H].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since Prof Blunt's appointment as a Professor of Petroleum Engineering at\u000a      Imperial College in 1999, his Consortium on Pore-Scale Modelling has\u000a      developed numerical tools to analyse the pore spaces of reservoir rocks,\u000a      predict multiphase flow properties and determine field-scale impacts on\u000a      oil recovery.

The codes represent the rock as a\u000a      disordered network of interconnected pores. In addition, a method was\u000a      developed to generate a topologically representative network from a\u000a      three-dimensional pore-space image. The development of micro-CT X-ray\u000a      scanning to image rocks at a resolution of around 1 &#181;m, combined with the\u000a      numerical modelling technology developed at Imperial College, has enabled\u000a      predictions to be made for different reservoir rocks. This can be\u000a      performed for rock samples too small for conventional measurements, is\u000a      much faster than the experiments and can explore a greater range of\u000a      possible flow processes. This allows for better reservoir management,\u000a      improving recovery while saving money in oil and gas field operations.\u000a    The key main research contributions have been: (i) development of\u000a      algorithms to compute the displacement of fluids at the pore scale\u000a      [1,2,4]; (ii) a method to analyse images of rocks [3] and from this\u000a      extract a topologically representative network through which fluid flow is\u000a      simulated [6]; (iii) demonstration of the predictive capabilities of this\u000a      method through comparison with laboratory and field data [1,2,4]; and (iv)\u000a      descriptions of case histories where using this approach to design optimal\u000a      water injection could lead to improved oil recovery [5].\u000a    The research was performed by Prof Blunt (at Imperial from 1999 to\u000a      present) and his research group, of which the main contributors were Dr\u000a      Mohammad Piri (now Associate Professor at the University of Wyoming), Dr\u000a      Per Valvatne (working for Shell as a reservoir engineer) and Hu Dong\u000a      (founder and President of a start-up company iRock Technologies that\u000a      exploits this technology). Prof Jackson (at the time a post-doc in the\u000a      group) contributed to the understanding of field-scale consequences for\u000a      oil recovery.\u000a    This research has been mentioned in Prof Blunt's citation for the Lester\u000a      C.

This research had two key deliverables; first, to\u000d\u000a      measure flowing froth\u000d\u000a      properties using image analysis; in particular bubble size and velocity,\u000d\u000a      and second to develop a\u000d\u000a      CFD model of flowing froths. As part of the research collaboration,\u000d\u000a      regular meetings were held in\u000d\u000a      the UK and South Africa to discuss the results and their practical\u000d\u000a      implications.\u000d\u000a    During the CFD froth model development, air recovery (the\u000d\u000a      fraction of air entering the cell that\u000d\u000a      overflows as froth, rather than bursting) was identified as an essential\u000d\u000a      boundary condition of the\u000d\u000a      flow models and that it will affect flotation performance. The value for\u000d\u000a      air recovery had not\u000d\u000a      previously been quantified or characterised at all in industrial\u000d\u000a      flotation, and was first measured by\u000d\u000a      the Froth and Foam Research Group. The Group's research proved to Anglo\u000d\u000a      Platinum and Rio\u000d\u000a      Tinto that air recovery was important and could be measured using\u000d\u000a      image analysis.\u000d\u000a    Air recovery was then, between 2007 and 2009, repeatedly measured by the\u000d\u000a      Froth and Foam\u000d\u000a      Research Group on Anglo Platinum and Rio Tinto copper industrial flotation\u000d\u000a      plants to quantify the\u000d\u000a      relationship between air recovery and the air rate, the most important\u000d\u000a      control variable. It was\u000d\u000a      discovered and confirmed through these trials that a maximum air recovery\u000d\u000a      exists as a function of\u000d\u000a      air rate &#8212; the so-called Peak Air Recovery or PAR. The link\u000d\u000a      between the air recovery, specifically\u000d\u000a      PAR, and the separation performance achieved at that air rate was,\u000d\u000a      however, not yet clear.\u000d\u000a    The strong correlation between the air rate, PAR and the separation\u000d\u000a      performance was finally\u000d\u000a      identified in 2009 by Hadler and Cilliers from industrial data they\u000d\u000a      collected [1]. It showed that the air\u000d\u000a      rate to the flotation cell that gives the highest air recovery (PAR), is\u000d\u000a      also the air rate that gives the\u000d\u000a      optimal flotation performance under the operating conditions. This\u000d\u000a      relationship allows the flotation\u000d\u000a      performance to be optimised by making a well-defined measurement solely of\u000d\u000a      the froth flow\u000d\u000a      properties, by simply measuring the air recovery at a range of air rates\u000d\u000a      and finding the air rate that\u000d\u000a      yields the maximum.\u000d\u000a    Throughout this research period and development of the PAR methodology,\u000d\u000a      Anglo American\u000d\u000a      Platinum and Rio Tinto were research partners. They became convinced of\u000d\u000a      the validity and\u000d\u000a      potential of the PAR research in two ways: first, the data that were used\u000d\u000a      to prove the concepts was\u000d\u000a      collected on their sites and with their cooperation and technical\u000d\u000a      personnel involvement. Second,\u000d\u000a      the results from the novel CFD simulation software developed in parallel\u000d\u000a      by the Froth and Foam\u000d\u000a      research team were proven to predict accurately industrial flotation\u000d\u000a      performance. Since the air\u000d\u000a      recovery concept was a direct outcome of the models, and the data showed\u000d\u000a      that their process\u000d\u000a      responded as predicted, they became convinced of the potential of the PAR\u000d\u000a      methodology for\u000d\u000a      determining plant settings.\u000d\u000a    It was proposed by the Froth and Foam Research Group that the PAR\u000d\u000a      methodology could be used\u000d\u000a      either as a manual technique by plant operators and engineers to optimise\u000d\u000a      their flotation circuits\u000d\u000a      and to inform the parameters used in their control strategies, or as part\u000d\u000a      of an automatic control\u000d\u000a      system. The two companies each took a different approach; Anglo American\u000d\u000a      Platinum the former,\u000d\u000a      Rio Tinto the latter. The measurement and manipulation of air recovery to\u000d\u000a      optimise flotation\u000d\u000a      separation performance procedure was patented by Imperial College in 2009\u000d\u000a      [2].\u000d\u000a    Anglo American Platinum independently made significant progress towards\u000d\u000a      developing an\u000d\u000a      automated control system that controls the air rate based on the froth\u000d\u000a      velocity and mass flowrate of\u000d\u000a      solids and liquid overflowing with the froth (the \"mass-pull\"). They\u000d\u000a      decided not to replace their\u000d\u000a      \"mass-pull\" control strategy with the PAR methodology, but to use instead\u000d\u000a      the PAR methodology\u000d\u000a      as a tool that can be easily utilized on remote mineral beneficiation\u000d\u000a      sites, thus enabling the\u000d\u000a      optimization of operations to maximize mineral recovery. This technique\u000d\u000a      was licenced from\u000d\u000a      Imperial College to Anglo American Platinum. The control limits determined\u000d\u000a      from PAR allows\u000d\u000a      tighter control of the process and avoids sub-optimal control parameter\u000d\u000a      combinations. Due to the\u000d\u000a      proprietary nature of this methodology we are unable to go into details as\u000d\u000a      to how exactly the new\u000d\u000a      methodology has resulted in impacts, but the PAR methodology has had\u000d\u000a      significant impacts on key\u000d\u000a      strategic drivers such as costs, water and energy efficiency per unit\u000d\u000a      metal at Anglo American\u000d\u000a      Platinum.[C]\u000d\u000a    Rio Tinto has implemented the PAR methodology as the basis of the\u000d\u000a      flotation control system at\u000d\u000a      their Kennecott Copper operation.

Air is bubbled through the mixture, the hydrophobic particles\u000d\u000a      attach to the bubble\u000d\u000a      surface, rise up and form an overflowing froth from which the valuable\u000d\u000a      mineral particles are\u000d\u000a      recovered. Typically, 5-15% of the valuable minerals are not recovered due\u000d\u000a      to sub-optimal\u000d\u000a      process settings, most important of which is the air rate.\u000d\u000a    Froth flotation collects valuable hydrophobic particles in an\u000d\u000a      overflowing, bursting froth. The air that\u000d\u000a      enters the bottom of the tank can leave either as bubbles in the\u000d\u000a      overflowing froth or by bursting on\u000d\u000a      the surface. The fraction of air overflowing as froth (i.e. not bursting)\u000d\u000a      is called the air recovery, and\u000d\u000a      is typically 5-25% of the total. It has long been surmised that the\u000d\u000a      magnitude of the air recovery\u000d\u000a      affects the separation performance; if no froth overflows, no particles\u000d\u000a      are recovered.\u000d\u000a    The air rate to a flotation tank affects the air recovery as it\u000d\u000a      determines the froth flow velocity and\u000d\u000a      the froth bursting rate. In 2005 the Froth and Foam Research Group first\u000d\u000a      reported that a maximum\u000d\u000a      (or peak) air recovery is found at a particular air rate. The maximum air\u000d\u000a      recovery with air rate can\u000d\u000a      be interpreted qualitatively as follows; at very low air rates, the\u000d\u000a      bubbles in the froth are thoroughly\u000d\u000a      coated with hydrophobic, film-stabilising particles and resist bursting.\u000d\u000a      However, because the froth\u000d\u000a      velocity is also low, the bubbles burst before overflowing. At very high\u000d\u000a      air rates, the bubbles are not\u000d\u000a      fully coated with particles and therefore burst readily and which gives\u000d\u000a      low air recoveries. There is\u000d\u000a      an intermediate air rate at which the bursting rate is reduced by particle\u000d\u000a      loading, but the froth\u000d\u000a      velocity is high enough for a substantial proportion of the bubbles to\u000d\u000a      overflow before bursting.\u000d\u000a    The key research finding was made between 2008 and 2009, when Dr Kathryn\u000d\u000a      Hadler established\u000d\u000a      the direct relationship between flotation mineral recovery and air\u000d\u000a      recovery [1]. This was the result\u000d\u000a      of an extensive set of industrial data collected from flotation plants in\u000d\u000a      South Africa, and its\u000d\u000a      subsequent analysis by Hadler. This showed for the first time that the\u000d\u000a      peak in air recovery, found at\u000d\u000a      a specific air rate, also corresponds to the peak in separation\u000d\u000a      performance; the highest mineral\u000d\u000a      recovery possible under the operating conditions. This allowed the\u000d\u000a      appropriate air rate for any\u000d\u000a      flotation tank to be determined in a rigorous and scientific way, simply\u000d\u000a      by measuring and\u000d\u000a      maximising the air recovery. The method of changing the air rate to\u000d\u000a      achieve PAR, and hence the\u000d\u000a      best performance, was subsequently patented by Cilliers through Imperial\u000d\u000a      College [2].\u000d\u000a    The PAR methodology has been extensively tested on industrial sites, and\u000d\u000a      has in all cases\u000d\u000a      improved performance.

My research, and its direct\u000a        application to industry problems, was made possible thanks to the\u000a        technology for FWI that Gerhard Pratt conceived and developed during his\u000a        time at Imperial College: which includes key publications and more\u000a        practically, a 2D frequency domain FWI software that pioneered the way\u000a        that the industry currently performs FWI. To this date, Gerhard's work\u000a        remains the reference in the field and his outstanding contribution to\u000a        the community has been recognized by the EAGE Conrad Schlumberger award\".\u000a    The head of FWI development at Chevron [8], writes:\u000a    \"In 2007, FWI was an untried, unproven, and potentially unaffordable\u000a        technique in 3D. The paper presented at EAGE in Rome, by Warner et al in\u000a        2008, demonstrated to a sceptical industry audience that 3D FWI could be\u000a        made to work efficiently and effectively on real 3D seismic data. This\u000a        success convinced several companies of the value of FWI, and within a\u000a        year BP was able to demonstrate the full commercial value of the\u000a        technique when applied to a large field dataset. This provided a huge\u000a        impetus to others to follow this early lead, and today everyone has the\u000a        technology. Without this paper, and the research at Imperial that\u000a        underpinned it, 3D FWI would still have happened eventually, but not so\u000a        quickly, and perhaps not yet.\"\u000a    Between 2008 and 2012 the industry was estimated, in a public statement\u000a      made by WesternGeco at the 2012 SEG conference in Las Vegas, to have spent\u000a      more than $200M on seismic data acquisition, data processing, bespoke\u000a      computer hardware, software development, and novel acquisition platforms,\u000a      specifically to support 3D FWI [9].\u000a    During the same period, in a public statement made on 9 June 2013 during\u000a      the \"Robust FWI Workshop\" at the 75th EAGE Conference &amp;\u000a      Exhibition in London, BP estimated that additional value of at least $500M\u000a      had been generated for the petroleum industry through the application of\u000a      FWI to specific seismic datasets that have influenced at least one hundred\u000a      individual drilling decisions [9]. This value is realised because improved\u000a      imaging leads to improved interpretation, reduced sub-surface risk and HSE\u000a      exposure, more discoveries, and more-effective oil and gas development and\u000a      extraction.\u000a    Specific impact in particular companies\u000a    Since 2008, eighteen companies have licensed 3D FWI computer software\u000a      from Imperial: BG Group, BP, CGG, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, DONG, DUGS,\u000a      ENI, Hess, Ion-GX, Maersk, Nexen, Rio Tinto, Shell, TGS, TOTAL, Tullow,\u000a      and Woodside [9].\u000a    Around a third of all the 3D seismic data worldwide, to which FWI has\u000a      been applied, was estimated in a public statement made by CGG during the\u000a      \"Advances in Model Building, Imaging, and FWI Workshop\" at the 2013 SEG\u000a      conference in Houston, to have been analysed using software derived from\u000a      that written at Imperial [9].\u000a    The head of global technology at Hess [10], writes:\u000a    \"By 2010, a few successful 3-D Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) results\u000a        had been published on modern seismic surveys. Hess conducted a worldwide\u000a        review of academic consortia, and discovered that Imperial College was\u000a        the only group to have FWI results on a real 3-D seismic data set. The\u000a        Imperial College Fullwave consortium was, and still is, the leading\u000a        academic group in 3-D full waveform inversion. Hess joined the\u000a        consortium in the fall of 2010 to collaborate and learn about ways to\u000a        apply FWI to real-world problems. With the assistance of Mike Warner and\u000a        his staff, we immediately and successfully applied their\u000a        industrial-grade code to one of our major assets, leapfrogging many\u000a        companies who were trying to climb the FWI learning curve by\u000a        themselves.\"\u000a    The head of geophysics for BG-Group [11], writes:\u000a    \"BG Group have supported the work at Imperial in 3D FWI since its\u000a        initiation in 2006.

Their\u000a      FWI services are built around the software package developed at Imperial\u000a      [9]. Since 2010, they have customised and integrated this package into\u000a      their core processing and imaging software, and Imperial and CGG have\u000a      jointly published the results of applying this software to industry\u000a      seismic data [5]. As a result of adopting Imperial's software, CGG has\u000a      moved in three years, from a position where they did not offer FWI as a\u000a      commercial service, to become the market leader in this field worldwide\u000a      [9].

The fundamentals of the method have long been\u000a      understood; the intellectual challenge has been to render this theory\u000a      computationally tractable and to apply it successfully to imperfect data\u000a      using realisable computer hardware configurations. In the mid 1990's,\u000a      Gerhard Pratt (Elf Lecturer, Imperial College, 1993-1998) and co-workers\u000a      at Imperial College developed the first practical implementation of\u000a      acoustic isotropic FWI in two-dimensions [1]. They developed an algorithm\u000a      in the frequency domain that was orders of magnitude faster than hitherto,\u000a      and demonstrated that this could successfully invert both synthetic and\u000a      field seismic datasets in 2D [2].\u000a    A decade later, Professors Michael Warner (Imperial, 1993-2013), Joanna\u000a      Morgan (Imperial, 1998-2013), Yanghua Wang (Imperial, 2003-2013) and their\u000a      co-workers built upon these early successes to extend the method into\u000a      three-dimensions, first in the frequency domain, and then into the\u000a      more-effective time domain, successively incorporating attenuation,\u000a      anisotropy and elastic effects. Although the extension from two to three\u000a      dimensions is conceptually simple, its practical computational\u000a      implementation is not. The direct solution of the wave equation that\u000a      Gerhard Pratt used in 2D is not computationally feasible in 3D. Instead,\u000a      the group developed iterative 3D solvers in the frequency domain, and\u000a      later, massively-parallel solvers in the time domain. Since the real world\u000a      is three dimensional and anisotropic, these developments were fundamental\u000a      to being able to apply the methodology usefully to real industrial\u000a      problems.\u000a    Michael Warner and his co-authors Ivan Stekl and Adrian Umpleby, also\u000a      from Imperial, obtained the first FWI results from 3D field data in 2008\u000a      [3], for which they were awarded the Bonarelli prize by the EAGE, the\u000a      leading European professional organisation in petroleum geoscience. Since\u000a      then, the range of problems, targets and datasets to which the methodology\u000a      can be successfully applied has continued to grow [4, 5, 6].

Analysis has\u000a      traditionally assumed an ideal, constant rate. The main limitation of this\u000a      approach is that the durations of constant rate periods are usually small\u000a      compared with the total production time. Therefore it provides only\u000a      limited information on the well-reservoir system. In particular, the\u000a      reservoir volume connected to the well is significantly under-estimated,\u000a      often leading to the unnecessary and expensive drilling of additional\u000a      wells to access the whole field. Production also has to be halted for such\u000a      measurements, resulting in lost revenue.\u000a    The problem of taking all the data gathered over long production times\u000a      was solved by Prof Gringarten, Dr Von Schroeter and Dr Hoellander from\u000a      2000 to 2003 in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering of\u000a      Imperial College. The approach used deconvolution to correct for the\u000a      effects of variable &#8212; and often uncertain &#8212; flow rates on the pressure\u000a      response. Deconvolution transforms variable-rate pressure data into a\u000a      constant-rate initial drawdown with a duration equal to the total duration\u000a      of the test and directly yields the corresponding pressure derivative.\u000a      This derivative is free from the distortions caused from errors introduced\u000a      by incomplete or truncated rate histories. This deconvolved derivative is\u000a      the sharp-focus pressure response from which the true behaviour of the\u000a      reservoir can be identified.\u000a    Previous attempts to solve this problem only worked for the rare cases\u000a      when the pressure and rates were known with virtual certainty &#8212; the\u000a      equivalent of only being able to design glasses if the structure of cornea\u000a      of the patient is known precisely. Prof. Gringarten and his team\u000a      introduced a new method which reformulates deconvolution as a nonlinear\u000a      Total Least Squares (TLSD) problem. The two main improvements are (1) a\u000a      nonlinear encoding of the reservoir response which makes explicit sign\u000a      constraints obsolete and (2) a modified error model which accounts for\u000a      errors in both pressure and rate data. The new method is capable of\u000a      deconvolving smooth, interpretable response functions from uncertain data\u000a      [3]. This was the first stable and practical deconvolutoion algorithm in\u000a      the literature: the equivalent of developing an eye test and glasses for\u000a      pressure data.\u000a    This research was performed under an industry-funded project on\u000a      \"Alternative Methods for Testing Oil and Gas Wells to Eliminate Emissions\"\u000a      sponsored by BP, Conoco, NorskHydro, and Schlumberger.

In particular Inner Mongolia has 770 billion\u000d\u000a      tonnes of mostly low grade coal resource suitable for UCG. These\u000d\u000a      coalfields are targeted by a number of international energy companies\u000d\u000a      active in the field of underground coal gasification. However, the\u000d\u000a      majority of the coal in these fields lies below several hundred metres of\u000d\u000a      very weak (~1-2 MPa Unconfined Compressive Strength) sediments of Late\u000d\u000a      Mesozoic sand, silt and conglomerate, rendering roof control extremely\u000d\u000a      difficult, if not impossible, with the currently applied conventional UCG\u000d\u000a      panel designs.\u000d\u000a    The \"linear UCG gasifier\" provides a viable solution to this engineering\u000d\u000a      problem.

This multinational Joint Venture\u000d\u000a      would not have gone ahead without the industrial capability offered by the\u000d\u000a      new \"linear UCG gasifier\" panel design.

Experimental and numerical research carried out\u000d\u000a      over the years focused on the implementation, for the first time, of\u000d\u000a      geomechanics principles in coal and coalbed methane reservoir engineering\u000d\u000a      and developed Imperial College's in-house enhanced coalbed methane\u000d\u000a      simulators METSIM and METSIM2. Research led to the internationally\u000d\u000a      recognised and adopted \"Shi and Durucan Permeability Model\" [4].\u000d\u000a    From 2000 onwards, the Group's research was extended to incorporate\u000d\u000a      underground coal gasification (UCG) and CO2 storage technology\u000d\u000a      in coalbeds [5], as well as saline aquifers and depleted gas reservoirs.\u000d\u000a      Research grants and contracts secured during this period raised over &#163;4.7m\u000d\u000a      worth of funding from government agencies, Research Councils, industry and\u000d\u000a      the European Commission.\u000d\u000a    One such project with particular relevance to the impact case study\u000d\u000a      presented here was carried out as part of a large EU FP6 contract [EU FP6\u000d\u000a      Grant SES6-CT-2004-502816, 2004-09] - and aimed at coupling underground\u000d\u000a      coal gasification with CCS. Drawing upon their expertise in coal mining,\u000d\u000a      CO2 geological storage and CBM\/ECBM reservoir geomechanics, the\u000d\u000a      Group at Imperial introduced a novel approach to Underground Coal\u000d\u000a      Gasification, integrating this technology with Carbon Capture and Storage\u000d\u000a      (CCS) for field applications and issued a confidential report entitled \"An\u000d\u000a      investigation into the fundamental processes governing CO2\u000d\u000a      storage in virgin seams and in coal seams stimulated by underground coal\u000d\u000a      gasification\" in 2009 [6]. The geomechanics of conventional UCG panel\u000d\u000a      progression and the mechanisms of rock and roof failure around a UCG\u000d\u000a      cavity were investigated and used as the means to simulate the\u000d\u000a      permeability of coal seams in order to overcome the injectivity losses\u000d\u000a      experienced during CO2 storage in coal. The research attracted\u000d\u000a      a number of approaches from companies seeking to implement these findings\u000d\u000a      in the field.\u000d\u000a    Contracted by Seamwell International, a private UK natural energy\u000d\u000a      resources company, in 2009 the Group's research on UCG focused on\u000d\u000a      developing new UCG panel designs to ensure that the application of UCG\u000d\u000a      technology can be extended to coalfields with weak roof conditions, such\u000d\u000a      as those experienced in Inner Mongolia and elsewhere in the world. By\u000d\u000a      combining the group's coal mine roof control expertise with extensive\u000d\u000a      geomechanical and thermomechanical modelling, they were able to address\u000d\u000a      the extremely weak roof challenge. They developed the new \"linear UCG\u000d\u000a      gasifier\" panel design, utilising the relatively high mechanical strength\u000d\u000a      of coal seams in the overall design, thereby enhancing roof rock stability\u000d\u000a      and providing self-supporting UCG cavity growth and reagent\u000d\u000a      injection\/syngas production paths in the subsurface.\u000d\u000a    Research and monitoring of the performance of the \"linear UCG gasifier\"\u000d\u000a      in the field will continue in collaboration with Seamwell International,\u000d\u000a      Central Mining Institute (GIG) in Poland, CSIRO in Australia, Golder\u000d\u000a      Associates in South Africa and a number of academic and industry partners\u000d\u000a      within the context of a newly funded &#8364;4 million EU project coordinated by\u000d\u000a      Imperial College during 2013-16 (FP7 Energy Project 608517, Technology\u000d\u000a      Options for Coupled Underground Coal Gasification and CO2\u000d\u000a      Capture and Storage, http:\/\/cordis.europa.eu\/projects\/rcn\/109590_en.html\u000d\u000a      or https:\/\/www.imperial.ac.uk\/ref\/webarchive\/gwf).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42157","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Royal Academy of Engineering"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research at Imperial College produced membranes at a small pilot\u000d\u000a      scale, and has resulted in patents and patent applications covering the\u000d\u000a      membranes and their means of fabrication. Key among these is UK Patent\u000d\u000a      GB2437519 [8] and the resulting international patent family, which\u000d\u000a      protects the cross linking of polyimide membranes to make them stable in a\u000d\u000a      wide range of organic solvents. Intellectual property on membrane\u000d\u000a      fabrication and applications of the membranes was assigned from Imperial\u000d\u000a      College to Imperial Innovations plc, the technology transfer company set\u000d\u000a      up by Imperial College. Innovations then licensed the findings of the OSN\u000d\u000a      research to an Imperial College spin-out company, Membrane Extraction\u000d\u000a      Technology (MET) Limited. MET's business goal was to develop and\u000d\u000a      commercialise the OSN technology. To do this MET developed a manufacturing\u000d\u000a      process for fabricating the first generation of OSN membranes based on\u000d\u000a      cross linked polyimide, including the stages of membrane formation and\u000d\u000a      post formation processing to crosslink the membrane and impregnate it with\u000d\u000a      conditioning agents. Techniques for wrapping spiral wound membrane modules\u000d\u000a      were developed by MET, together with highly solvent stable adhesives for\u000d\u000a      these modules. This resulted in the creation of the first spiral wound\u000d\u000a      membrane products in 2009, which have been commercialised under the\u000d\u000a      registered trademark DuramemTM [9]. This development activity\u000d\u000a      was supported by five PhD students from the Livingston laboratory being\u000d\u000a      employed by MET.\u000d\u000a    In parallel with these product development activities, MET undertook a\u000d\u000a      dissemination campaign in which the Imperial OSN technology was promoted\u000d\u000a      at membrane and chemical conferences and trade shows (eg ACHEMA (DE),\u000d\u000a      ChemShow (USA), Informex (US), CPHi (Europe), as well as through\u000d\u000a      individual visits to customers. MET developed a lab bench test cell (the\u000d\u000a      METcell) in which the OSN membranes could be evaluated and tested by\u000d\u000a      interested end users. This was followed by an extension to a cross flow\u000d\u000a      cell system, and a bench top testing unit capable of handling small spiral\u000d\u000a      modules. This activity generated an enormous interest in the technology\u000d\u000a      from process development and separations professionals in the chemical and\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical industries and more than 100 MET cell units have been sold\u000d\u000a      as at June 2013. The customers for these cells include many major\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals and chemical companies, and companies with commercial\u000d\u000a      interests in solvent processing, for example in the electronics industry.\u000d\u000a    A key milestone in the impact of OSN technology was the installation of\u000d\u000a      DuramemTM spiral wound membrane modules in a plant at GSK\u000d\u000a      Ulverston in 2009, where they were installed in a facility regulated under\u000d\u000a      GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) [10]. In this application, the membrane\u000d\u000a      modules were applied to the concentration and recovery of a valuable\u000d\u000a      active pharmaceutical ingredient. In several cases customers who initially\u000d\u000a      began with test cell products have constructed pilot and production scale\u000d\u000a      processing units for OSN, including Johnson and Johnson [11] and Merck AG\u000d\u000a      [12]. The OSN membranes have also proven highly effective in the\u000d\u000a      purification of solvents for re-use, for example in the electronics\u000d\u000a      industry.\u000d\u000a    The growing success of the OSN technology attracted a business unit of\u000d\u000a      Evonik who manufacture polymers, Evonik Fibres, to acquire MET for several\u000d\u000a      million euros. The acquisition completed in March 2010 to form Evonik MET\u000d\u000a      [13]. This was a positive outcome with the shares being acquired at a\u000d\u000a      substantial multiple of the price MET investors had paid for them. Evonik\u000d\u000a      have so far invested in a new premises and a new membrane manufacturing\u000d\u000a      facility in Greenford, West London, operational in June 2011, and have\u000d\u000a      tripled the number of employees globally from 10 to 30 since the\u000d\u000a      acquisition. The OSN membranes invented at Imperial College are now\u000d\u000a      produced commercially in this new facility as large process scale 8\" x 40\"\u000d\u000a      spiral wound elements. The compounded annual growth rate of Evonik MET in\u000d\u000a      2013 is in excess of 40%, with nearly all going to export. To support\u000d\u000a      these exports, Evonik MET has appointed Business Development Managers in\u000d\u000a      the USA, India, China, and Brazil, and has applications development labs\u000d\u000a      in the USA and India. Evonik Vice President for Fibres and Membranes,\u000d\u000a      writes [14]:\u000d\u000a    \"As one of the world leading specialty chemical companies, and also\u000d\u000a        the owner of Evonik MET, we have unique insight into the value and\u000d\u000a        impact of OSN technology in chemistry-based businesses. This is because\u000d\u000a        we see both internal applications within Evonik's own businesses, and at\u000d\u000a        the same time are involved in providing the technology to customers in\u000d\u000a        other chemicals businesses. The value proposition for the industry and\u000d\u000a        its applications is high. As an example,&#163;1M of sales is creating either\u000d\u000a        process optimization potential or new product sales of at least &#163;10M and\u000d\u000a        beyond, which makes the OSN technology a significant enabling technology\u000d\u000a        and game changer in the chemical and adjacent industries. This is a\u000d\u000a        truly motivating figure and is why, with the marketing and technical\u000d\u000a        power of Evonik behind it, this technology is making a major impact\u000d\u000a        across the spectrum of organic chemical processes\".\u000d\u000a    Relating this to MET\/Evonik MET OSN turnover of &#163;4M from 1 Jan 2008-31\u000d\u000a      Dec 2012 [15] indicates that the technology is already providing in excess\u000d\u000a      of &#163;40M-&#163;80M of value to chemical and related industries. The\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries of the Imperial OSN research therefore include the global\u000d\u000a      chemical sciences based companies that purchase the products derived from\u000d\u000a      the research, and the UK economy which gains from a newly established UK\u000d\u000a      based manufacturing industry, in which the UK is a clear world leader.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) is a membrane separation technology\u000d\u000a      used for separating molecules present in organic solvents.

In spite of these clear advantages,\u000d\u000a      prior to 2008 OSN had had a limited impact in industry.\u000d\u000a    Research at Imperial College into OSN has addressed three broad\u000d\u000a      challenges: (i) developing applications of OSN to organic processes; (ii)\u000d\u000a      understanding transport phenomena in OSN systems so as to enable process\u000d\u000a      design; and (iii) most demanding, creating new OSN membranes to overcome\u000d\u000a      poor stability in solvents. Addressing all three challenges has been\u000d\u000a      essential to underpinning the impact that OSN technology has made over the\u000d\u000a      last 5 years. This research has been carried out between 1999-present by\u000d\u000a      postgraduate students and post-docs led by Professor Andrew Livingston\u000d\u000a      FREng, who has been in post from 1990-present.\u000d\u000a    Research into applications of OSN membranes in organic processes began at\u000d\u000a      Imperial in 1999 using commercial membranes which had been (then recently)\u000d\u000a      developed for a specific lube oil dewaxing process by WR Grace. This\u000d\u000a      research showed how OSN membranes could be used in homogeneous catalyst\u000d\u000a      recycling, impurity removal, solvent exchange and solute concentration\u000d\u000a      [1,2]. Livingston was invited to give various keynote\/plenary lectures on\u000d\u000a      these applications, including at Euromembrane 2004 (Hamburg) and ICOM 2005\u000d\u000a      (Seoul). The work on applications also highlighted that the limited number\u000d\u000a      of available membranes were inadequate for the requirements of most\u000d\u000a      potential applications, due to very limited stability in organic solvents.\u000d\u000a    Research into transport phenomena considered how the solvents, solutes\u000d\u000a      and membranes interact and how these interactions determine process\u000d\u000a      performance. The thermodynamic properties of the solutions from which\u000d\u000a      molecules are to be separated were shown to be important in determining\u000d\u000a      flux and rejection [3]. Research into concentration polarisation in both\u000d\u000a      flat sheet and spiral wound modules [4] was used to provide underpinning\u000d\u000a      data for process scale up and implementation, providing confidence that\u000d\u000a      the performance of OSN technology could be reliably estimated, and this\u000d\u000a      work has been presented at the prestigious Gordon Research Conference on\u000d\u000a      Membranes: Materials and Processes (London NH, 2006) and Euromembrane 2009\u000d\u000a      (keynote).\u000d\u000a    Research into membrane fabrication and the influence of membrane\u000d\u000a      fabrication parameters on membrane performance started in 2003. A key\u000d\u000a      discovery was that membranes fabricated from polyimide could be\u000d\u000a      cross-linked post-fabrication by contacting them with a solution\u000d\u000a      containing diamines to give polyamide-imides, which provide outstanding\u000d\u000a      resistance to organic solvents. Surprisingly, this stability was gained\u000d\u000a      without any substantial effect on the permeation rates of molecules\u000d\u000a      through the membranes [5]. A second key finding was that the permeation\u000d\u000a      pathways in the membranes could be manipulated through directed control of\u000d\u000a      the formulation and fabrication conditions, and specifically through the\u000d\u000a      addition of a co-solvent to polymer dope solutions [6]. This research has\u000d\u000a      led to presentations at the North American Membrane Society (NAMS) in 2012\u000d\u000a      (plenary) and ICOM 2011 (keynote) and the Gordon Research Conference on\u000d\u000a      Membranes: Materials and Processes (London NH, 2012).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42158","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Developing high fidelity models is both a challenge and an opportunity\u000a      for the process and energy industrial sectors. Such models allow the\u000a      de-risking of new designs, facilitate scale up, and help to troubleshoot\u000a      and debottleneck existing operations. The returns on investment in\u000a      modelling exercises are in principle very high relative to the potential\u000a      benefits. However, the development and analysis of process models is a\u000a      challenging task due to the need for a high level of user skill, and the\u000a      need for effective tools for model description and model solution. In\u000a      1997, Process Systems Enterprises Limited (PSE) was formed by a team of\u000a      academics (Macchietto, Pantelides, Perkins, Pistikopoulos, Shah) from the\u000a      CPSE to meet these challenges, and to ensure the impact of research from\u000a      the CPSE.\u000a    Since 1993 CPSE has operated an industrial consortium. Member companies\u000a      of this consortium (ranging in number between 8 and 12 over the years,\u000a      with typical fees of &#163;15,000 per annum) have an opportunity to evaluate\u000a      software prototypes (under special licences) and provide feedback. This\u000a      model of prototyping, testing and feedback proved an invaluable part of\u000a      the commercialisation process. It helped to ensure that once PSE was\u000a      launched, a software platform that would meet the needs of users was\u000a      available. This combination of basic and industrially-oriented research,\u000a      together with strong user engagement in the research and development\u000a      phase, meant that there was a queue of ready customers as soon as the\u000a      commercial version of the technology was made available. Additionally\u000a      Professor Costas Pantelides, who was the team leader for the R&amp;D\u000a      activities, moved from CPSE to PSE Ltd in 2000 where he continues as the\u000a      Managing Director to date, while retaining a 0.4FTE position in the CPSE.\u000a      Additional routes through which the impact has taken place include the\u000a      provision of consultancy services by staff from the Dept to PSE, the\u000a      recruitment by PSE of PhD students and research associates and the\u000a      facilitation by PSE of a partnership agreement between ABB and Imperial\u000a      College.\u000a    At the launch of PSE, the gPROMSTM modelling platform,\u000a      including modelling language, solution algorithms, results visualisation\u000a      and prototype user interface, comprised an IP package that was licensed to\u000a      the company by Imperial Innovations, in return for 35% of the equity.\u000a      Hence the research outputs formed the core of the company's assets. The\u000a      company then worked on improving the usability, developing documentation,\u000a      business development and incorporating new innovations arising from CPSE.\u000a      PSE Ltd has so far solely commercialised IP arising from the CPSE, and all\u000a      its revenues can be traced back to the research at the CPSE. Important\u000a      impact indicators for PSE Ltd include:\u000a    \u000a      A thriving company which has current annual revenue of &#163;10m and\u000a        cumulative revenues since inception of &#163;97m (approx &#163;40m during the REF\u000a        period).\u000a      A global presence (with offices in the UK, US, Germany, Japan and\u000a        Korea, and agencies in Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Thailand, Malaysia, China\u000a        and Taiwan with over 60% (on average) of revenues from outside the UK;\u000a        it is therefore a key export earner[19].\u000a      PSE employs approximately 100 people in high-end jobs.\u000a      PSE's products are in routine use in major companies (including 7 of\u000a        the world's top 10 chemical companies) and over 200 universities, and\u000a        form part of industrial practice.\u000a      PSE has an ongoing record of innovation with new products (e.g. in\u000a        solids [12], offshore safety [14], and systems modelling in healthcare,\u000a        including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [13]).\u000a    \u000a    PSE's platform enables the easy construction and solution of first\u000a      principles models with a powerful and user-friendly tool; this has made\u000a      possible a variety of new approaches to model based process design and\u000a      optimisation such as:\u000a    \u000a      design of a new chemical process for a Korean chemical company that\u000a        saved $5m in reactor costs alone [8];\u000a      design of a new, \"cleaner\" propylene oxide process [10], where the\u000a        user could consider all the trade-offs across the whole process\u000a        simultaneously and therefore ensure a global optimisation while\u000a        implementing a process which decouples the production of propylene oxide\u000a        from that of styrene. Dr Hilario Rodriguez of Repsol states \"We\u000a          increased total annualised profit by several tens of millions of\u000a          &#8364;\/year\" [8];\u000a      design of new integrated devices such as fuel cells [11], including\u000a        effective systems engineering and design, and the consideration of\u000a        issues such as water management and heat transfer, which enables the\u000a        design of fuel cells which are robust to transient operation;\u000a      design of new crystallisation processes [12], which enables tight\u000a        control of particle size distribution;\u000a      scale up of an impact mill [15], where P&amp;G reduced risk and\u000a        experimental effort through modelling;\u000a      Optimising the production of terephthaldehyde (TPAL) [16] through\u000a        multiscale modelling, resulting in much better temperature control,\u000a        saving $2m-$4m per year;\u000a      Improved life cycle service offers from a catalyst manufacturer to its\u000a        clients [17], where models are used to advise the catalyst\u000a        manufacturer's clients on the optimal operation of their processes.\u000a    \u000a    All of the above have been undertaken by PSE's industrial clients, who\u000a      are generally in the chemicals, energy and health, foods and lifestyle\u000a      industries. Typically, the return on investment in modelling these\u000a      applications using PSE software and consulting is at least 10 and in the\u000a      case of [8] below closer to 100. The overall impact from\u000a        commercialisation of modelling tools based on research in the CPSE over\u000a        the REF period is therefore around &#163;400m, and since inception in 1997,\u000a        &#163;1bn. The Chemical Systems Discipline Head of P&amp;G [18] has\u000a      indicated his willingness to corroborate this impact and respond to panel\u000a      queries.\u000a    PSE's vision of model-based applications used throughout the process\u000a      lifecycle is now being realised, with modelling supporting discovery (e.g.\u000a      in pharmaceuticals [12,13]), design (across a wide range of operations)\u000a      and operations (e.g. safety assessment [14]).\u000a    The impact of the commercialisation of the software from CPSE was\u000a      recognised when four of the academic staff (Machietto, Pantelides,\u000a      Pistikopoulos, Shah) involved in launching PSE were part of a 5 person\u000a      team awarded the MacRobert Award and Prize in 2007. This is the UK's\u000a      premier award for engineering innovation and recognises \"world leading\u000a        engineering developments....\" Which demonstrate innovation, commercial\u000a        success, and benefits to the community\" [9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research into new process modelling tools and numerical simulation and\u000a      optimisation algorithms at Imperial's Centre for Process Systems\u000a      Engineering (CPSE) has resulted in a powerful new modelling technology.

CPSE's research focussed on the development of\u000a      process modelling technology and its application to process design,\u000a      operations and control. Although CPSE was a joint research centre with\u000a      UCL, the research leading to the gPROMS platform took place at Imperial.\u000a    The early version of the gPROMS technology was wholly developed within\u000a      the CPSE, primarily funded by the IRC block grant, with the development of\u000a      the modelling technology being undertaken in the period 1993 to date.\u000a    The research programmes in CPSE were organised into a number of thematic\u000a      areas including:\u000a    \u000a      Process synthesis and design;\u000a      Process operations and control;\u000a      Process modelling and numerical methods.\u000a    \u000a    In each of these areas, ground-breaking developments in modelling\u000a      languages (both for process models and for operating procedures),\u000a      numerical solution techniques, experimental design, dynamic optimisation,\u000a      and applications to process design and operation, took place.

A number of challenges arise in attempting\u000a      to model these processes, including the need for a comprehensive model\u000a      description language for such processes, and the need for describing\u000a      operating procedures and solving complex, dynamic hybrid systems models.\u000a      These were addressed through the development of a novel, formal modelling\u000a      language and compiler derived from the design of programming languages and\u000a      their compilers [1]; a language for describing process operations and\u000a      operating procedures [1]; new numerical methods for discrete-continuous\u000a      simulation (solution of partial differential algebraic equations with\u000a      discontinuities and equation\/variable switching) [3, 4]; and new\u000a      algorithms for dynamic optimisation [2, 6] which exploit the particular\u000a      features of process systems. This research platform was then extended to\u000a      allow integration with other tools developed elsewhere [5]. The core staff\u000a      involved were John Perkins (in post 1993-2001), Costas Pantelides (in post\u000a      1993-date), Stratos Pistikopoulos (in post 1993-date), Sandro Macchietto\u000a      (in post 1993-date) and Nilay Shah (in post 1993-date).\u000a    These leading-edge research activities all fed into the development of\u000a      the gPROMS modelling framework. Another feature of CPSE's research\u000a      programme was \"major integrated projects\"; these were used to integrate\u000a      strands of basic research and undertake development activities in\u000a      collaboration with industry, which enabled rapid evaluation on\u000a      industrially-relevant problems and refinement of the methods. A\u000a      significant proportion of CPSE's budget was oriented to a major project\u000a      around the design and implementation of a next generation process\u000a      modelling architecture, the result being the development of a prototype\u000a      tool, tested with a group of potential users, based on CPSE's industrial\u000a      consortium (see below) and including Unilever, ICI, Du Pont and Dow\u000a      Chemical.\u000a    The basic research that underpins gPROMS resulted in two major awards: a\u000a      Queen's Anniversary Award for Education (2003) and a Queen's Award for\u000a      Enterprise: Innovation (2001).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42159","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Oil-and-gas companies need to transport significant volumes of multiphase\u000a      fluid long distances through pipelines from deep-sea beds. This is a\u000a      process complicated by the complexity of multiphase flows. For instance,\u000a      the intermittency arising from slug flow enhances pipeline erosion and\u000a      increases the stresses on pipeline bends. Severe fluctuations in flow\u000a      volumes also cause unwanted flaring at separators on oil platforms\u000a      resulting in safety concerns and subsequent reduction in the operation\u000a      capacity of oil plants. These issues give rise to design challenges and\u000a      usually lead to design compromises that sacrifice efficiency and\/or size\u000a      of the processing plant. The oil-and-gas industry is therefore in need of\u000a      validated predictive tools for flow assurance predictions.\u000a    Software company members of the TMF programme have been key in spreading\u000a      the impact of the research. The slug capturing model in the TRIOMPH code\u000a      developed at Imperial [5] has been embedded in two new commercial codes,\u000a      namely LEDAFLOW issued by Kongsberg Oil and Gas Technologies and PROMPT\u000a      being issued by Multiphase Simulation Ltd. One of the companies supplying\u000a      consultancy and software to the oil-and-gas industry is FEESA Ltd, which\u000a      is based in Farnborough Hants. The Managing Director of FEESA Ltd, states:\u000a    \"Though FEESA is a software company, it does not develop its own\u000a      multiphase models, rather it gives engineers access to the multiphase\u000a      models of others, such as the published (e.g. Beggs and Brill) and\u000a      commercial models (i.e. OLGA-S and LedaPoint from SPT and Kongsberg,\u000a      respectively). Though most developments in these tools are commercial in\u000a      confidence to their developers, FEESA is aware that they do borrow ideas\u000a      developed in TMF quite a lot. An example of this is the slug capturing\u000a      model in LedaPoint which .... proved to be a more physically reasonable\u000a      method for modelling slugs than the traditional slug tracking method. I'm\u000a      sure Kongsberg would not have gone down this route without Raad [Issa]'s\u000a      group in TMF blazing the way some years before. Better slug models mean\u000a      more confidence in surge volume predictions, which lead to smaller design\u000a      margins on topsides equipment, which can lead to designs being cheaper and\u000a      more optimal. There is also a safety implication of reducing separator\u000a      volumes on production facilities. In short, pressure is energy per unit\u000a      volume and the less stored up energy there is on manned facilities the\u000a      safer everyone is.\" [C]\u000a    Importantly, the codes are not credible without validation. The unique\u000a      experimental information in relation to slug flow provided by Imperial\u000a      research [1-4] has allowed successful validation, which in turn has led to\u000a      the results of their predictions being accepted by the industry as\u000a      accurate. This has enabled the oil-and-gas companies to determine the\u000a      operating envelopes, flow regimes and associated design considerations as\u000a      well as the energy requirements likely to be encountered in particular\u000a      applications.\u000a    Two examples illustrating the contribution of TMF to the oil and gas\u000a      industry are provided:\u000a    \u000a      SPT Group, now part of Schlumberger, is one of the largest software\u000a        providers to the oil-and gas industry with an operating income of $29.6M\u000a        in 2012. SPT has been actively associated with TMF since its foundation.\u000a        The SPT group developed the single platform (OLGA), which is now the\u000a        world leading product for multi-phase oil and gas flow prediction. Chief\u000a        Scientist of SPT Group, states: \"These flows are complex and\u000a          multiscale.

Without the knowledge from TMF, some of the oil industry\u000a          projects would have been too risky to proceed. Thus, it is possible to\u000a          say that the impact of TMF on the oil industry is worth hundreds of\u000a          millions of dollars.\" [A]\u000a    \u000a    The TMF collaborative programme allows immediate use of the research by\u000a      the industrial partners.

It consists of a reclinable 37m-long\u000a      test-section with a 78mm internal diameter. WASP is equipped with X-ray\u000a      tomography sensors, Gamma-ray densitometry, and high-speed visualisation\u000a      capabilities, which can yield hold-up information, and axial- and\u000a      side-views of the complex interfacial structures accompanying the various\u000a      multiphase flow regimes as a function of pressure drop or flow rates,\u000a      temperature, and inlet conditions. In 2001 Prof Hewitt published work\u000a      where laser-induced fluorescence and photo-chromic dye-tracing have been\u000a      developed and deployed within the rig to examine, in detail, the flow\u000a      properties of liquid-liquid and three-phase flows. [1]\u000a    Further experimental research led by Hewitt in 2006 [2] elucidated the\u000a      initiation mechanisms of `slug' flows, and showed that initiation is\u000a      delayed at high pressures. Hewitt and Matar, and co-workers [3] showed\u000a      that, in large-diameter pipes, slug-flow is by-passed completely. A\u000a      two-beam X-ray system was also developed by Hewitt in 2005 [4], which\u000a      allows tomographic images of multiphase (oil-water-gas) flow to be\u000a      recorded, for accurate visualisations in pipe flows. Along with support\u000a      from the industrial partner this work was supported from EPSRC grant\u000a      GR\/S17765\/01\u000a    This experimental work was complemented by the development of a model\u000a      (Transients In One-dimensional Multi-PHase flow &#8212;TRIOMPH) by Dr Raad Issa\u000a      in 2003 [5], which demonstrated the ability of a two-fluid model to\u000a      automatically capture the initiation of slugs, to follow their development\u000a      as they travel along a pipe, and to calculate characteristics such as slug\u000a      length and frequency [5]. Further models, such as the General Runge-Kutta\u000a      Annular Modelling Program (GRAMP), were developed by Hewitt [6] to provide\u000a      predictions of local void fraction, pressure gradient, entrained liquid\u000a      fraction, and film thickness in annular flow.\u000a    The combination of Imperial's experimental work and the models developed,\u000a      particularly those by Dr Issa, allowed reliable predictions of multiphase\u000a      flow regimes and their transitions, and resulted in substantial benefits\u000a      to the oil and gas industry as described in section 4 below.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42160","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A molecular description of matter using statistical mechanical theories\u000a      and computer simulation is the key to understanding and predicting the\u000a      thermophysical properties of dense fluids and materials.

The application of the\u000a      SAFT-VR approach to industrial problems has occurred primarily through\u000a      collaborative projects, secondments and consultancies. Among the more than\u000a      20 consultancy and collaborative projects that have been completed\u000a      successfully using the SAFT-VR technology, we highlight the following\u000a      impacts:\u000a    \u000a      Design of manufacturing processes for the production of replacement\u000a        refrigerants (Chief Scientist, ICI\/AkzoNobel [7]): a huge challenge in\u000a        the design of such processes is the need for phase equilibria data for\u000a        mixtures involving hydrogen fluoride (HF). This is a highly corrosive\u000a        and dangerous substance, making experiments difficult, costly and\u000a        undesirable. In traditional distillation columns, each tray incurs an\u000a        additional cost of &#163;1m in material costs due to the corrosive nature of\u000a        HF. Thanks to its predictive capabilities, SAFT-VR was used in lieu of\u000a        experiments to generate the data required for process design. SAFT-VR\u000a        has also been used to identify erroneous experimental data, in cases\u000a        where the formation of two liquid phases had not been correctly\u000a        identified, thereby lowering the risk of process development by avoiding\u000a        costly design errors.\u000a      Surfactants: SAFT-VR was used in a collaborative project with BP\u000a        Exploration to understand the behaviour of surfactants used in enhanced\u000a        oil recovery to extend oil field lifetimes by a factor of up to 5. BP\u000a        North Sea Operations Manager [8], our collaborator at BP Exploration,\u000a        commented that the use of SAFT-VR removed the need for a large\u000a        experimental programme to identify a surfactant formulation for squeeze\u000a        treatment, focusing the effort onto half a dozen options only, out of an\u000a        essentially infinite formulation space. He stated the following: \"Large\u000a          cost savings can be achieved by extending the squeeze lifetimes: the\u000a          average cost of an intervention on BPA's Magnus asset is &#163;130K (with\u000a          deferred oil costs) and annual treatment costs run to several million\u000a          pounds.I could also point to some side-benefits: one of the wells in\u000a          the North Sea was shut in at 8mbd [mbd=thousand barrels per day] for a\u000a          scale squeeze. When it was squeezed with the glycol ether treatment,\u000a          it came back on at 12mbd. The accelerated value of this production\u000a          would be significant, I would imagine order 2-3mm$ [million $] (1.4\u000a          million barrels per year accelerated by 1 year at 20$\/bbl, say).

I have rarely seen an academic project yield quite such direct\u000a          insights and benefits and it remains one of the highlights for me of\u000a          what can be done with quality research and development.\" The\u000a        business was developed and transferred to TR Oil Services, creating\u000a        additional work and benefits to the wider UK oil industry.\u000a      Increased productivity in polyethylene gas phase reactor (Dr Moen,\u000a        Borealis [9]). SAFT-VR was used to identify a mechanism to increase\u000a        reactor productivity by 30% during polymerisation in Borealis' Borstar\u000a        process [6]. Such an increase in productivity is key to the production\u000a        of such a commodity product as polyethylene. By changing the \"inert\" gas\u000a        used in the process, it was shown that the solubility of the key\u000a        reactant, ethylene monomer, could be increased significantly, resulting\u000a        in an increased reaction rate. Such a prediction is made possible by\u000a        SAFT-VR's ability to model the behaviour of highly non-ideal polymer-solvent\u000a\u0009\u0009mixtures.\u000a    \u000a    The collaborative and consultancy projects created demand for making\u000a      SAFT-VR more widely available to industrial users. To enable this, the\u000a      software for the SAFT-VR family of models was licensed in 2009 via\u000a      Imperial Innovations to Process Systems Enterprise Ltd (PSE), a thriving\u000a      SME spun out of Imperial in 1997. In 2012, with customers impressed by the\u000a      accuracy and versatility of the platform, PSE acquired the full rights to\u000a      the software, which is now marketed as gSAFT [10], [11] and [12]. gSAFT is\u000a      a key technological element in the &#163;3m project (partly funded by ETI,\u000a      [13], on end-to-end modelling of carbon capture and storage (CCS) chains;\u000a      this project alone has created four full-time highly skilled jobs at PSE's\u000a      UK headquarters [10]. The development and marketing of gSAFT as a\u000a      strategic technology by PSE (Weblink [14]) has re-inforced its impact\u000a      across multiple industries.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The SAFT-VR family of thermodynamic models has made it possible\u000a      to predict reliably the behaviour of the many complex and challenging\u000a      fluids that are found across a range of industrial sectors, including oil\u000a      &amp; gas, chemicals (refrigerants, surfactants, polymers), energy (carbon\u000a      capture solvents, carbon dioxide-rich streams) and pharmaceuticals.\u000a    The SAFT-VR models have had a wide impact on industrial practice. At BP,\u000a      they have been used to design novel surfactants that have increased the\u000a      lifetime of oil fields up to five-fold, avoiding maintenance interventions\u000a      costing millions of dollars and increasing productivity by 50% (worth $2-3\u000a\u0009  million per year per well). At Borealis, they have been used to\u000a      understand how to increase the productivity of the reactor in the flagship\u000a      Borstar process by 30%.

The prediction of the\u000a      phase behaviour of these fluids (e.g., in what phase(s) they exist at\u000a      given temperature, pressure and composition) and of their thermophysical\u000a      properties, underpins the ability to design efficient and competitive\u000a      manufacturing processes. Yet, until recently, it had not been possible to\u000a      accurately model the phase behaviour of complex mixtures involving, for\u000a      example, water, oil, surfactants and salts. With the Statistical\u000a      Associating Fluid Theory for potentials of Variable Range (SAFT-VR)\u000a      platform, the Imperial College group consisting of Professors Claire\u000a      Adjiman (1998-date), Amparo Galindo (2000-date) and George Jackson\u000a      (1998-date) has played a central role in developing a theoretical approach\u000a      for the description of molecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding,\u000a      dipolar forces and chain flexibility, which are of crucial importance in\u000a      industrially-relevant fluids. This body of work represents a major advance\u000a      in the application of formal statistical mechanics to realistic molecular\u000a      interactions. Due to its predictive accuracy, which has been validated\u000a      experimentally, its versatility and its firm molecular foundation, the\u000a      SAFT approach is rapidly superseding well established chemical engineering\u000a      equations of state, putting the UK at the leading edge of molecular\u000a      modelling of multicomponent fluids.\u000a    The SAFT-VR equation of state, initially developed by Galindo and\u000a      Jackson, brought significant flexibility to the modelling of complex\u000a      molecular interactions, allowing hydrogen-bonding, dipolar and other\u000a      strong interactions to be modelled within a unified approach [1]. The\u000a      framework has been demonstrated to offer exceptional predictive\u000a      capabilities for complex fluids including polymers, polar fluids (e.g.,\u000a      carbon dioxide, refrigerants), strongly associating \/ hydrogen bonding\u000a      fluids (e.g., carboxylic acids, hydrogen fluoride, water), mixed\u000a      electrolytes (e.g., inorganic salts, charged surfactants), gas hydrates\u000a      and asphaltenes. The same models can be used to describe the behaviour of\u000a      a given mixture across wide temperature and pressure ranges. The group has\u000a      published 54 papers on the technique and its improvements and applications\u000a      since the late 90s, and the approach has been widely taken up by other\u000a      academic researchers.\u000a    A key milestone in the development of the theory is the extension to\u000a      mixtures containing electrolytes and exhibiting salting-out behaviour,\u000a      which are pervasive in the oil and fine chemicals industries. This work,\u000a      undertaken in collaboration with Schlumberger, showed that a broad range\u000a      of electrolytic mixtures could be treated within a single framework, with\u000a      transferable parameters for the ions, thereby maintaining the predictive\u000a      capabilities of the approach [2].\u000a    A further milestone was reached with the development of a group\u000a      contribution version, SAFT-f067, by PhD student Alexandros Lymperiadis\u000a      (2003-2008; supervisors Adjiman, Galindo, Jackson). In this version, the\u000a      basic building blocks are atomic groups (e.g., CH3 or OH), rather than\u000a      whole molecules [3]. This dramatically increased the predictive\u000a      capabilities of the methodology, by allowing the thermodynamic properties\u000a      of new molecules or mixtures to be represented reliably, in the absence of\u000a      any experimental data.\u000a    While there have been many applications of SAFT-VR to fluids of\u000a      industrial relevance, those with the highest impact on practice include\u000a      the modelling of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) replacement refrigerants by a\u000a      number of PhD students and PDRAs (1998-2008; supervisors Adjiman, Galindo,\u000a      Jackson); this need arose since the original chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)\u000a      refrigerants are responsible for the depletion of ozone in the upper\u000a      atmosphere. The production of HFCs invariably involves mixtures containing\u000a      HF, a highly corrosive material, which renders experiments very expensive\u000a      and complex. SAFT-VR models were shown to predict their behaviour well,\u000a      while standard methods fail due to the extreme association between the\u000a      molecules in these mixtures [4]. At the other end of the molecular scale,\u000a      SAFT has been found to provide an excellent description of the phase\u000a      equilibria of aqueous solutions of hydrocarbons and micellar solutions of\u000a      alkyl polyoxyethylene surfactants by PDRA Blanca Garcia (1998-2000;\u000a      supervisor Jackson) and PhD student Gary Clark (2005-2008; supervisors\u000a      Galindo, Jackson); the phase diagrams of these non-ionic surfactants and\u000a      polymers are characterized by closed-loop cloud curves denoting large\u000a      regions of re-entrant miscibility which require a specific treatment of\u000a      molecular association [5]. Finally SAFT has been used by PDRA Andrew\u000a      Haslam (2002 to date; supervisors Galindo, Jackson) to provide a very\u000a      effective representation of the phase behaviour (adsorption) in gas phase\u000a      polymerisation reactions [6]; e.g., a gas phase comprising the ethene\u000a      monomer and but-1-ene co-monomer in contact with a reacting polyethylene\u000a      grain.\u000a    As a result of these advances, the academics have been invited to present\u000a      keynote lectures at leading international conferences, including at the\u000a      Thermodynamics Conference Series (Jackson, UK, 1999; Adjiman, Greece,\u000a      2011), European Symposium on Applied Thermodynamics (ESAT &#8212; Jackson,\u000a      Greece, 2000 and Denmark, 2006; Galindo, St Petersburg, 2011), the EFCE\u000a      International Workshops on Methods for Product and Process Design\u000a      (Jackson, Germany, 2010, 2013), Properties and Phase Equilibria for\u000a      Product and Process Design (PPEPPD &#8212; Jackson, Japan, 2001; Galindo, China,\u000a      2010), Foundations of Molecular Modeling and Simulation (FOMMS; Adjiman,\u000a      USA, 2012), the American Institute of Chemical Engineers Annual meetings\u000a      (AIChE; Jackson, USA, 2012). The group launched the SAFT Workshop Series\u000a      in 2010; two workshops have taken place so far, in Spain and France.\u000a    In addition PhD students and postdocs from the group have undertaken\u000a      numerous consultancies (e.g., BP, Shell, Total, Exxon, Schlumberger, Ciba,\u000a      BMS, Pfizer, P&amp;G), and as a result of the group interactions a number\u000a      of our staff are now employed in key companies (BP, Shell, Qatar\u000a      Petroleum, Air Products, Aspen Technology, Genesis Oil &amp; Gas, KBC\u000a      Advanced Technologies, Process Systems Enterprise, Solvay etc.).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42161","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Surface Measurement Systems Limited (SMS) was formed by Drs.

The DVS instrumentation approach is closely linked to the\u000d\u000a      IGC research work pioneered by Dr Williams at Imperial College funded by\u000d\u000a      an industrial research contract with Du Pont Fibres. Dr Williams remains\u000d\u000a      the Managing Director of SMS and in 1997-1999 spent 0.5 FTE working with\u000d\u000a      SMS (the balance of FTE in post at Imperial College), promoting the DVS\u000d\u000a      product and working on its commercialisation.\u000d\u000a    This new DVS approach allowed water sorption isotherms to be obtained 20\u000d\u000a      times faster, using 20 times less sample and 20 times more accurately [7]\u000d\u000a      than traditional measurement approaches, thus transforming laboratory\u000d\u000a      practice in this domain.

His initial research focused on refining the technique known\u000d\u000a      as Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC). In this technique an unknown powder\u000d\u000a      is packed into a small column the size of a pencil, and its surface and\u000d\u000a      bulk properties are determined by eluting known vapour molecules through\u000d\u000a      the column using a gas chromatographic approach. PhD students who worked\u000d\u000a      on IGC and related techniques included N.Zafeiropoulos (1998-2002),\u000d\u000a      P.Yla-Maihaniemi (2001-4) J.Heng (2002-5), R.Ho (2005-8) and , J.Khoo\u000d\u000a      (2006-2010).

They key breakthroughs in the instrument approach were: (i)\u000d\u000a      translation from chromatographic to a gravimetric measurement method [1];\u000d\u000a      and (ii) the discovery of the sensitivity of these methods to molecular\u000d\u000a      structure and morphology [2]. These molecular adsorption based\u000d\u000a      experimental techniques can provide a unique and important insight into\u000d\u000a      the physicochemical properties of particulate materials such as\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals.

The\u000a      conventional approach to\u000a      designing against this threat is to essentially make an assumption about\u000a      the worst impact energy\u000a      (typically 50J) likely to occur during the lifetime of the aircraft. The\u000a      structure would then be\u000a      designed to tolerate any damage produced from such an impact when exposed\u000a      to the most severe\u000a      mechanical loading anticipated during its lifetime (i.e. design ultimate\u000a      load). However, such an\u000a      approach is not rigorous, and makes several assumptions regarding the type\u000a      of impact conditions\u000a      and the resulting damage. With weight being critical for aerospace design,\u000a      overdesign of a\u000a      structure imparts a considerable penalty; but if the\u000a      perceived level of threat is underestimated, this could\u000a      lead to parts of the aircraft being susceptible to\u000a      damage during service, with potentially catastrophic or\u000a      very costly implications. The latter is the case for the\u000a      Lockheed C130K Hercules transport aircraft which the\u000a      RAF have been using in the Gulf and Afghanistan and\u000a      for which repair of runway debris damage is up to &#163;1M\u000a      per aircraft (source: verbal discussions with MoD and\u000a      DSTL staff [A]).\u000a\u000aFig 1 Runway debris damage to the leading edge of an undercarridge door of a transport aircraft\u000a\u0009  \u000a    During initial work investigating the physics of the\u000a      interactions between the hard stone, the ground and the compliant rubber\u000a      tyre, the Head of\u000a      Landing Gear Structures in Airbus Military (Spain) approached Dr\u000a      Greenhalgh. He was interested\u000a      in further developing the understanding of lofted debris and provided\u000a      support for this work as\u000a      outlined in section 2.\u000a    This research then had an immediate pathway for significant impact and\u000a      has been relied upon by\u000a      Airbus during the 2011 in designing the Airbus A400M Aircraft. The\u000a      research allowed Airbus to\u000a      quantify the severity of the threat to aircraft from runway debris and so\u000a      enabled engineers to\u000a      reliably design efficient aircraft structures to tolerate this threat [A].\u000a      The debris lofting model was\u000a      able to predict the potential damage to the lower fuselage of the A400M\u000a      aircraft from lofted runway\u000a      debris. This was used in the design of a deflector plate for the nose\u000a      landing gear (NLG) which\u000a      would protect the lower fuselage from lofted stone damage. In particular,\u000a      the models developed at\u000a      Imperial were used to optimise the shape and exact position of the\u000a      deflector plate [A].\u000a    In May 2012, The Head of Landing Gear Structures at Airbus commented that\u000a      the research\u000a      undertaken by Imperial College was \"absolutely needed, because landing on\u000a      unprepared runways\u000a      was a new concept inside the Airbus Aircraft Family\" and went on to state\u000a      \"The model identified the\u000a      most critical parts on the fuselage, predicting in a reliable way the\u000a      probable trajectories for a stone\u000a      lofted by the NLG tyres and making it possible to start developing\u000a      protections and devices that help\u000a      to minimize the effect of such impacts during the operation on unprepared\u000a      fields\" The results of the\u000a      Imperial model \"confirmed the need of a stone deflector to help protect\u000a      the belly of the A400M\" and\u000a      allowed Airbus \"to improve the efficiency of such a stone deflector in the\u000a      series design\". The results\u000a      of the model developed have subsequently been shared inside the Airbus\u000a      Community, and have\u000a      raised interest from other areas as such as Power Plant and Dynamic\u000a      Analysis [B].\u000a    As has been demonstrated above, the research has had a direct impact on\u000a      the design of the new\u000a      Airbus A400M. This has enabled one of the features of the plane to be\u000a      reduced operational costs\u000a      compared to its predecessor the Hercules C130K. The A400M has had\u000a      successful test flights and\u000a      is now being manufactured with over 174 orders in place as at 30th June\u000a      2013 [C]. The results of\u000a      tests undertaken in the summer of 2013 on an unsurfaced runway covered\u000a      with gravel of different\u000a      sizes confirmed predictions made by the model and the efficacy of the\u000a      deflector plate [B].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Runway stones thrown up by aircraft undercarriage wheels can cause\u000a      considerable damage to the\u000a      aircraft structure.

It\u000a      was funded through a\u000a      DSTL EPSRC CASE studentship. Before work started, there had been no\u000a      realistic, reliable means\u000a      of predicting the impact threat from runway stones hitting the\u000a      undercarriage of the aircraft. Using\u000a      information on runway debris characteristics, aircraft and tyre geometry\u000a      for take-off and landing\u000a      profiles, a model was devised to predict the likelihood of a tyre\/debris\u000a      encounter. This model was\u000a      published as part of Reference 1. The next stage in the research was to\u000a      model the mechanisms by\u000a      which the debris, tyre and runway surface interacted to cause lofting and\u000a      to determine the initial\u000a      direction and speed of the projected debris. Initially, finite element\u000a      (FE) models using contact\u000a      mechanics were developed which captured the physics of the interactions\u000a      between the hard stone,\u000a      the ground and the compliant rubber tyre. The first models assumed solid,\u000a      cylindrical tyres [2, 3],\u000a      and these were extended to more realistic configurations, which, using\u000a      data from indentation\u000a      testing on aircraft tyres [4], included the inflation pressure and\u000a      detailed tyre geometries [1]. All\u000a      these models were validated against bespoke drop-weight experiments,\u000a      monitored with high speed\u000a      video, which reproduced key aspects of the contact conditions between the\u000a      stones, tyres and\u000a      ground. The understanding gained during the FE and experimental\u000a      investigations, enabled the\u000a      development of a physically-based analytical model [5] which was the first\u000a      to provide an insight into\u000a      the critical parameters which dictated the severity of the stone lofting\u000a      processes, such as tyre\u000a      geometry, stone mass and shape, and aircraft speed, and predicted the\u000a      direction and initial speed,\u000a      which included a significant spin component [1]. The kinetic energy\u000a      associated with spin could be\u000a      as much as 50% of the translational component. During a second research\u000a      project funded directly\u000a      by Airbus the models were further refined to incorporate the effect of the\u000a      multiple interactions that\u000a      occur when a wheel encounters a group of runway stones and to include the\u000a      geometry of the tyres\u000a      used on the Airbus A400M. Sang Nguyen received his PhD from the department\u000a      of Aeronautics\u000a      Imperial College for this work.\u000a    Having established a reliable model for the initial state of the lofted\u000a      stone at the start of its\u000a      projected motion, the next stage of research investigated the subsequent\u000a      motion of the debris to\u000a      enable prediction of the severity of any resulting impact on the aircraft.\u000a      This work was funded\u000a      directly by Airbus during 2011 and was led by Dr. Emile Greenhalgh with\u000a      Dr. Nguyen as a\u000a      postdoctoral researcher. Aerodynamic models were developed for the\u000a      interaction between the\u000a      spinning lofted stone and the airflow in the wake of the undercarriage\u000a      wheels and beneath the\u000a      fuselage [6]. The research focussed on the relative interaction between\u000a      the different aerodynamic\u000a      flows (such as tyre wake, aircraft boundary layer, ground effects and\u000a      turbulence) and the rapidly\u000a      spinning stones and culminated in the production of 'threat maps' which\u000a      identify the sites on the\u000a      aircraft lower fuselage that are exposed to the most severe impact\u000a      conditions.\u000a\u000aFigure 1: Overview of key research that led to impact\u000a\u0009  \u000a    This is a unique capability that allows designers to optimise the damage\u000a      tolerance of\u000a      aerostructures exposed to such impact threats (i.e. undercarriage\u000a      components and lower\u000a      fuselage). The location and severity of debris damage predicted by the\u000a      model has been shown to\u000a      be in good agreement with that observed on aircraft such as C130K\u000a      Hercules.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42163","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Royal Academy of Engineering"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Stability analysis of vortex dominated flows around complex geometries\u000a      Being able to accurately identify and manage the generation of vortices is\u000a      key to competitive racing\u000a      car design. Using the insights from the Nektar code Prof Sherwin carried\u000a      out work, directly\u000a      sponsored by the Formula One team McLaren Racing Ltd. to numerically\u000a      simulate the unsteady\u000a      flow around the complex geometry of a Formula One car. This involves\u000a      multiple vortices, some of\u000a      which are subject to fast, dynamically driven external effects such as\u000a      merging or obstacle\u000a      interactions and some to large scale effects such as strong pressure\u000a      gradients. These external\u000a      effects can lead to vortex breakdown. The industry supported work looked\u000a      at the systematic\u000a      characterisation and identification of the vortices present in a typical\u000a      Formula 1 racing car\u000a      configuration. Due to the new Nektar code it was carried out with an\u000a      improved level of accuracy\u000a      and the systematic identification of the vortices intrinsic parameters was\u000a      achieved [A]. This has\u000a      allowed for the effective management in the design of Formula One cars and\u000a      has been used since\u000a      2011 in the computational fluid dynamics data analysis of McLaren's F1\u000a      Cars. Formula One is an\u000a      extremely competitive arena where any resultant modification in the design\u000a      of a racing car is\u000a      considered to be highly confidential information. For this reason we are\u000a      unable to go into the\u000a      specific detail of the impact of the above on design and performance, but\u000a      the significant impact is\u000a      confirmed by McLaren's Engineers:\u000a    \u000a      \"I implemented computational tools... which is now regularly used in\u000a        the CFD data analysis\u000a        of McLaren's F1 Cars\" (CFD Engineer, McLaren Racing Ltd, May 2012) [B] ;\u000a      \"Managing these vortical structures efficiently around the car can\u000a        lead to significant\u000a        performance gains at the race track.

Specifically, between\u000a      1997 and 2001 Prof Bearman investigated the geometry changes that were\u000a      needed to produce\u000a      significant reduction in drag [5] and determined that small\u000a      changes can have a very significant\u000a      effect. More recently (in 2010) Prof Morrison also investigated the\u000a      relationship between transient-\u000a      growth disturbances in the boundary layer and the wall-shear-stress\u000a      signature and the effect on the\u000a      relative placement of sensors and actuators in feedback control\u000a      implementation [6].

Research at\u000d\u000a      Imperial between 1993-2013 led to a major advance in the ability to\u000d\u000a      virtually design a range of protective components, which are often very\u000d\u000a      expensive or impractical to test, and provided improved performance and\u000d\u000a      significant cost savings to the UK between 2008 and 2013.

As a result Dstl has been able to\u000d\u000a      develop lighter, more effective armour for both military vehicles and the\u000d\u000a      dismounted soldier, providing personnel with better protection and\u000d\u000a      superior operational performance. These improvements were achieved with\u000d\u000a      significant cost savings and, more importantly, have ultimately\u000d\u000a      contributed to the saving of many lives during expeditionary operations.\u000d\u000a      Within the UK MOD the development and procurement of military vehicles\u000d\u000a      represents a significant portion of the annual defence budget. A typical\u000d\u000a      development cost for a single vehicle is &#163;500M. A critical part of this\u000d\u000a      process is to ensure that the occupants of the vehicles are properly\u000d\u000a      protected against potential explosive and penetrative threats present in\u000d\u000a      the current theatres of operation. While initial financial outlay for the\u000d\u000a      protection of a vehicle would typically amount to &#163;10M, the total cost for\u000d\u000a      protection development over the lifetime of each vehicle will be\u000d\u000a      significantly higher due to the need for system retrofitting as new\u000d\u000a      threats or operational requirements emerge.

The study\u000d\u000a      represents one of the first industry-led assessments of solar sail\u000d\u000a      technology in Europe (Source C)\u000d\u000a      and the incorporation into these earlier plans laid the foundations for\u000d\u000a      operations from 2008.\u000d\u000a    For example the programme of research on non-Keplerian orbits has been\u000d\u000a      exploited by the\u000d\u000a      European Space Agency through contract work to develop new concepts to\u000d\u000a      ensure, for the first\u000d\u000a      time, continuous communications with crewed deep space missions\u000d\u000a      (2009-2010) (Source D).\u000d\u000a      Study lead Francois Bosquillon de Frescheville, European Space Operations\u000d\u000a      Centre, noted that\u000d\u000a      the \"research will help pave the way for future robotic missions to\u000d\u000a        places we've never been, or for a\u000d\u000a        human mission to Mars\" (Source E).\u000d\u000a    Most recently, families of non-Keplerian orbits are underpinning a\u000d\u000a      DLR\/ESA concept for the\u000d\u000a      Gossamer-3 solar sail technology demonstration mission. McInnes, Macdonald\u000d\u000a      and Vasile are key\u000d\u000a      participants in DLR\/ESA solar sail working groups which are coordinating\u000d\u000a      the development of the\u000d\u000a      technology (2010-present), and indeed Macdonald and McInnes chair two of\u000d\u000a      three working groups.\u000d\u000a      The novel families of non-Keplerian orbits driving the design of the\u000d\u000a      Gossamer-3 mission and its\u000d\u000a      technology development by DLR again represents a major impact on agency\u000d\u000a      thinking, investments\u000d\u000a      and industrial development to bring the technology to flight readiness.\u000d\u000a    The mission will provide early warning of so-called space weather events\u000d\u000a      which can have\u000d\u000a      potentially catastrophic impacts on terrestrial communication services,\u000d\u000a      navigation systems and\u000d\u000a      energy grids. The availability of such warning is key to security and\u000d\u000a      resilience in a highly networked\u000d\u000a      global society. It is these compelling applications of the research which\u000d\u000a      has influenced agency\u000d\u000a      roadmaps and industry investments to ensure their realisation.\u000d\u000a    Commercial Adoption: Applications of families of non-Keplerian\u000d\u000a      orbits to deliver new commercial\u000d\u000a      communication services have been developed for space prime contractor EADS\u000d\u000a      Astrium Ltd\u000d\u000a      through commercial contract work (2010-2011). Astrium is a global company\u000d\u000a      employing 18,000\u000d\u000a      staff and is an established leader in space transportation, satellite\u000d\u000a      systems and services (Source\u000d\u000a      F). It was demonstrated that non-Keplerian orbits offer entirely new\u000d\u000a      vantage points for commercial\u000d\u000a      communications services and the programme of research has influenced\u000d\u000a      company thinking on the\u000d\u000a      development of orbits future commercial communication platforms (Source\u000d\u000a      G).202f\u000d\u000a    As a further example, design tools for families of non-Keplerian orbits\u000d\u000a      are now embedded in\u000d\u000a      commercial MATLAB software toolboxes by the leading US space engineering\u000d\u000a      software house\u000d\u000a      Princeton Satellite Systems Inc.

Their adoption in this\u000d\u000a      widely-used professional\u000d\u000a      software suite is an indication of the influence of the programme of basic\u000d\u000a      research conducted by\u000d\u000a      the Strathclyde team (Source H).\u000d\u000a    Investment into NASA solar sail demonstration: Families of\u000d\u000a      artificial equilibria devised by\u000d\u000a      McInnes and co-workers underpin a major NASA investment ($20M programme)\u000d\u000a      in a solar sail\u000d\u000a      technology demonstration, currently in manufacture and scheduled for\u000d\u000a      launch in 2014.

To realise the\u000d\u000a      commercial benefits, a University\u000d\u000a      spin out company has been formed to bring the Contra Rotating Marine\u000d\u000a      Turbine (CoRMaT)\u000d\u000a      technology to market, creating the following types of impact:\u000d\u000a    New spin out created: Nautricity Limited was registered in 2009,\u000d\u000a      and secured &#163;5M industrial\u000d\u000a      investment from First Tech, the investment arm of First Oil, in 2010\u000d\u000a      (Source A). To provide\u000d\u000a      continuity in the development and commercialisation of the CoRMaT\u000d\u000a      technology, Nautricity has\u000d\u000a      seconded Johnstone as its CEO to lead the development of both the company\u000d\u000a      and the CoRMaT\u000d\u000a      technology within UK, North American and South Korean markets. In 2012\/13\u000d\u000a      Nautricity built pre-commercial\u000d\u000a      full scale systems for deployment in UK and International waters and to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate\u000d\u000a      economic viability.\u000d\u000a    Adoption of new renewable energy technology\u000d\u000a      The CoRMaT technology is considered unique and pioneering in that it can\u000d\u000a      be deployed at mid\u000d\u000a      water column, in deeper water, and where the flow velocities are faster.\u000d\u000a      Due to the reduced\u000d\u000a      complexity and inherent passive control integrated into the CoRMaT\u000d\u000a      technology, this has delivered\u000d\u000a      `step changing' cost reductions in harnessing tidal energy. These reduced\u000d\u000a      costs make it\u000d\u000a      economically viable to harness power from less `energetic' tidal sites and\u000d\u000a      sites located in deeper\u000d\u000a      waters, neither of which were previously considered feasible. This\u000d\u000a      substantively increases the\u000d\u000a      exploitable tidal resource.\u000d\u000a    CoRMaT is a proven, next generation, tidal stream turbine. The technology\u000d\u000a      is regarded by the\u000d\u000a      Carbon Trust, Scottish Enterprise and both UK and Scottish Governments as\u000d\u000a      being a next\u000d\u000a      generation technology which is `disruptive' to the industry. This\u000d\u000a      `disruptive' nature is associated\u000d\u000a      with the delivery of necessary step changes to make it more cost\u000d\u000a      competitive with other forms of\u000d\u000a      renewable energy. The capital cost has been assessed by the Carbon Trust,\u000d\u000a      UK (Source B) and\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Government to deliver &#163;3,240\/kW for a 500 kW device,\u000d\u000a      approximately 40% of the\u000d\u000a      costs quoted for competing 1st generation technologies. The projected\u000d\u000a      electricity generating cost,\u000d\u000a      14p\/kWh, is currently within the predicted 2020 band (12 to 18p\/kWh) for\u000d\u000a      tidal stream turbines\u000d\u000a      operating in a velocity between 2.5 m\/s and 3.5 m\/s. The costs for CoRMaT\u000d\u000a      are expected to be\u000d\u000a      profitable. Operational costs have been calculated at &#163;160\/ MWh while\u000d\u000a      existing Government\u000d\u000a      incentives of 5 Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROC's) will provide a\u000d\u000a      revenue of approximately\u000d\u000a      &#163;230\/ MWh. The university spin-out company, Nautricity, is in the process\u000d\u000a      of demonstrating the\u000d\u000a      commercial viability of CoRMaT when deployed at full scale to capitalise\u000d\u000a      on this.\u000d\u000a    In 2011 Nautricity secured an agreement to lease for the development of a\u000d\u000a      3MW test array from\u000d\u000a      The Crown Estates. This led to the development of the first small array at\u000d\u000a      the Mull of Kintyre off the\u000d\u000a      south-west coast of Scotland, with the potential to build out to a 30MW\u000d\u000a      tidal array. Nautricity has\u000d\u000a      secured outline consent for a tidal site together with grid connection\u000d\u000a      approval to facilitate the\u000d\u000a      development of the site in 2014 (Source C). In February 2012 Nautricity\u000d\u000a      secured a &#163;250k\u000d\u000a      SmartScotland award from the Scottish government for a &#163;900k project\u000d\u000a      developing and proving a\u000d\u000a      novel tidal energy mooring system to augment the performance of the CoRMaT\u000d\u000a      system. The\u000d\u000a      prototype mooring system with a full scale CoRMaT turbine was deployed at\u000d\u000a      the European Marine\u000d\u000a      Energy Centre, Orkney in February 2013. In July 2012, Nautricity secured a\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government\u000d\u000a      WATERS II award of &#163;1.4M against a &#163;5.5M project to deploy and demonstrate\u000d\u000a      a commercial\u000d\u000a      system in deeper waters off the west coast of Scotland, to be deployed and\u000d\u000a      commissioned during\u000d\u000a      the summer of 2014.\u000d\u000a    Influence on Government Policy: The delivery of the CoRMaT\u000d\u000a      technology has changed both UK\u000d\u000a      and Scottish Government marine renewable policy. The realisation of next\u000d\u000a      generation technology\u000d\u000a      being available has scoped the development of the Scottish Government's\u000d\u000a      Waters II competition in\u000d\u000a      2012 to specifically support the delivery of next generation wave and\u000d\u000a      tidal energy technologies\u000d\u000a      which promise to deliver `step-change' cost reductions (Source D).\u000d\u000a      Subsequently, the Carbon Trust\u000d\u000a      is using the cost benefits of the CoRMaT technology as a bench mark for\u000d\u000a      the capital and\u000d\u000a      operational costs of tidal technologies (Source B). Nautricity personnel\u000d\u000a      have been invited (January\u000d\u000a      2012) to sit on the Scottish Government's reconvened Marine Energy Group\u000d\u000a      (Source E), and\u000d\u000a      Scottish Renewables: Marine Energy Working Group (Source F). Both these\u000d\u000a      groups have a remit\u000d\u000a      to inform both the Scottish and UK Government of necessary policy\u000d\u000a      development in order to deliver\u000d\u000a      a marine renewable industry. These groups informed the recent Waters II,\u000d\u000a      Wave Energy\u000d\u000a      Acceleration, and Marine Renewable Consolidation Fund calls, which are\u000d\u000a      managed by the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government and the Carbon Trust.\u000d\u000a    Commercial benefit to utility companies and other organisations:\u000d\u000a      Nautricity have\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the commercial viability of marine power extraction to the\u000d\u000a      energy utilities. This is\u000d\u000a      bringing commercial benefit to the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)\u000d\u000a      and its supply chain in\u000d\u000a      the Orkney Islands and the Kintyre peninsula, where the commercial\u000d\u000a      deployment of the technology\u000d\u000a      at the Mull of Kintyre is taking place. The CoRMaT design is protected\u000d\u000a      internationally by Patents\u000d\u000a      GB2005\/161492 and GB2010\/ 1104524.2 and once an indigenous UK market is\u000d\u000a      developed an\u000d\u000a      International market will be exploited. In overseas market development,\u000d\u000a      Nautricity's CoRMaT\u000d\u000a      technology has been shortlisted as a preferred technology by Fundy Tidal\u000d\u000a      Inc. for a 3MW project it\u000d\u000a      is developing in the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia Canada, and by Haida Gwaii\u000d\u000a      Tidal, British\u000d\u000a      Columbia Canada for a 1.5MW community tidal energy project. With the\u000d\u000a      growth in electricity\u000d\u000a      supplies from renewables, especially in Asia, Nautricity has been invited\u000d\u000a      to develop and deploy its\u000d\u000a      CoRMaT technology in these emerging markets. The recent Memorandum of\u000d\u000a      Understanding\u000d\u000a      between the Scottish Government and the Incheon Authority, South Korea (in\u000d\u000a      May 2013) to\u000d\u000a      collaborate in the development of tidal energy in the Incheon region\u000d\u000a      provides the delivery vehicle\u000d\u000a      for the tidal energy technology.

The UK is\u000d\u000a      leading the\u000d\u000a      international development of a marine renewable industry, which is\u000d\u000a      contributing to the realisation of\u000d\u000a      2020 targets for renewable energy capture. The research described here\u000d\u000a      investigated and\u000d\u000a      established a more efficient and cost effective engineering solution to\u000d\u000a      extracting energy from tidal\u000d\u000a      flows. The forces generated by the gravitational attraction of the moon\u000d\u000a      and the sun's movements\u000d\u000a      relative to the earth produce strong marine tidal flows, which are locally\u000d\u000a      concentrated by\u000d\u000a      landmasses. These strong tidal currents represent a vast renewable energy\u000d\u000a      resource.\u000d\u000a    Key findings: The outcomes from the research identified a novel,\u000d\u000a      more efficient tidal turbine\u000d\u000a      configuration consisting of dual-contra-rotating rotors with a dissimilar\u000d\u000a      number of fixed pitched\u000d\u000a      blades per rotor. On the back of this, a Scottish Enterprise Proof of\u000d\u000a      Concept (PoC) award was\u000d\u000a      secured by Clarke, Grant and Johnstone in 2004 - 2008 to investigate\u000d\u000a      whether this new approach\u000d\u000a      was physically viable and delivered the expectations of the initial\u000d\u000a      research.

This provided the platform for\u000d\u000a      introducing and developing a workable rule-set of probabilistic\u000d\u000a      regulations via a series of large-scale international research projects.\u000d\u000a      In particular the HARDER project provided all requisite input to IMO for\u000d\u000a      SOLAS 2009. On this basis, the IMO Working Group, with the support of the\u000d\u000a      HARDER project findings (Source 6) developed the harmonised regulations in\u000d\u000a      draft form in 2004. Following various amendments for ease and consistency\u000d\u000a      of implementation, these entered into force in January 2009. NA-ME\u000d\u000a      researchers were involved in the Working Group and played a pivotal role\u000d\u000a      in the development of the SOLAS 2009 rules. The underpinning research\u000d\u000a      towards the development of SOLAS 2009 also proved instrumental in the\u000d\u000a      eventual adoption of the regulations by the international maritime\u000d\u000a      community (Source 2). This effort has thus resulted in new worldwide\u000d\u000a      safety policy and improved standards; ultimately to safer shipping.\u000d\u000a    Successful spin out company: NA-ME research by Vassalos and Turan\u000d\u000a      led to the formation of a spin-out company Safety at Sea Ltd (SaS) in 1999\u000d\u000a      to offer specialist safety services to the marine industry and this spin\u000d\u000a      out has continued to have impact since 2008. Safety at Sea is now a wholly\u000d\u000a      owned subsidiary of Brookes Bell Partnership following its merger with\u000d\u000a      that company in 2011, and is a successful marine consultancy, specialising\u000d\u000a      in marine and offshore safety, engineering and cost effective operation\u000d\u000a      (Source 3).\u000d\u000a    Impact on International Regulations: All new ships built worldwide\u000d\u000a      after 2009 must comply with SOLAS 2009 regulations. Given that damage\u000d\u000a      stability failure represents 90% of the risk to human lives in maritime\u000d\u000a      accidents, this affects over 2 billion people who travel on passenger\u000d\u000a      ships each year, and around 100,000 commercial vessels, operated by around\u000d\u000a      1.5 million crew. In 2009-2012, over 10,000 ships were built under SOLAS\u000d\u000a      2009 regulations (Source 7). Currently, over 2,500 ships worldwide (worth\u000d\u000a      $100Bn) are being designed and built to SOLAS 2009 regulations. The impact\u000d\u000a      of the NA-ME research in Europe is even greater, as the performance-based\u000d\u000a      standards in the Stockholm agreement have been applied to existing\u000d\u000a      Passenger\/Car ferries as well as new builds since 1997. In Northern Europe\u000d\u000a      more than 200 existing vessels were upgraded to the standards set out in\u000d\u000a      the Stockholm agreement in the period up to 2009. The impact continues as\u000d\u000a      300 existing vessels in Southern Europe are being upgraded to the standard\u000d\u000a      in the period 2009 to 2015. More than 200 million passengers and 15\u000d\u000a      million cars\/trailers are transported annually throughout Europe on these\u000d\u000a      vessels.\u000d\u000a    Reduction in risk to human life: IMO statistics show a reduction\u000d\u000a      of around 15-20% per annum in the loss of life in maritime accidents since\u000d\u000a      the introduction of SOLAS 2009 (Sources 8 and 9). This equates to an\u000d\u000a      average of 200-300 fewer fatalities per annum due to safety failures since\u000d\u000a      the introduction of SOLAS 2009; this rate of reduction will improve\u000d\u000a      further as new ships are being built to the new rules. Since 2009, two\u000d\u000a      billion passengers are travelling in a safer environment at sea. IHS\u000d\u000a      Fairplay's 2010 World Casualty Statistics publication shows that the\u000d\u000a      number of lives lost at sea fell sharply in 2010 compared with the\u000d\u000a      previous 12 months. In 2010, 250 seafarers lost their lives, the lowest\u000d\u000a      figures for loss of life since 2003 (quoted in Source 9 p.18).\u000d\u000a    Improvement to build and design: Since 2008 NA-ME researchers and\u000d\u000a      the spin-out company Safety at Sea Ltd (SaS) have contributed to upgrading\u000d\u000a      of some 130 EU vessels to new damaged stability standards, as well as\u000d\u000a      design of new-build ships owned by international companies including\u000d\u000a      P&amp;O Ferries, Stena Line, Caledonian MacBrayne Ferries, Viking Line,\u000d\u000a      Color Line, DFDS Ferries, Irish Ferries, Grandi Navi Velocci, Grimaldi,\u000d\u000a      VShips and Blue Star Ferries. These ferries continue to operate in the UK\u000d\u000a      and European waters providing safer maritime transport to the UK and EU\u000d\u000a      public (Source 3).\u000d\u000a    Using the new rules and expertise gained via research, SaS has been\u000d\u000a      involved in the design of cruise vessels and RoPax for EU-based companies\u000d\u000a      including Caledonian MacBrayne, P&amp;O Ferries, Color Line, Stena Line,\u000d\u000a      Carnival Cruises and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines (RCCL) (Source 3).\u000d\u000a      SaS are involved with design of some of the most innovative passenger\u000d\u000a      ships ever built e.g., Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines' Genesis class,\u000d\u000a      designed on the basis of the new rules with safety as the main objective\u000d\u000a      and demonstrating significant and cost-effective safety enhancement (see\u000d\u000a      Reference 4). SaS is now responsible for all aspects of safety for Titanic\u000a        II, a replica of the legendary ship currently being designed (2013).\u000d\u000a    Similar support has been provided to other organisations around the\u000d\u000a      world, including the US Coast Guard, Daewoo and Samsung Heavy Industries\u000d\u000a      (Korea), Mitsubishi (Japan) and NCL (Singapore), to help increase safety\u000d\u000a      performance and standards. Since 2009 more than 15 cruise ships have been\u000d\u000a      built in Europe to SOLAS 2009 regulations at a cost of $15Bn to the ship\u000d\u000a      building industry.\u000d\u000a    Economic Impact &#8212; cost savings and employment: The SOLAS 2009\u000d\u000a      performance-based standards enable cost-effective safety improvements.\u000d\u000a      This incentivises the maritime industry to invest in safety whilst\u000d\u000a      offering significant economic savings, including substantial savings in\u000d\u000a      insurance costs. SaS Ltd employs more than 25 engineers offering services\u000d\u000a      worldwide and has strategic partnerships with Lloyds Register of Shipping\u000d\u000a      and Brookes Bell (UK); Deltamarin (Finland); Alpha Marine Services\u000d\u000a      (Greece); Maersk (Denmark) and Panama Canal (Panama).\u000d\u000a    Embedding a safety culture in the shipping industry: An important\u000d\u000a      contribution of NA-ME led research on safety has been in incentivising a\u000d\u000a      change of the industry mind-set from rules-based to performance-based\u000d\u000a      safety standards, enabling measurement of safety and offering a mechanism\u000d\u000a      to facilitate and sustain a maritime industry safety culture. This has\u000d\u000a      impacted on promotion of safety awareness and a proactive approach to\u000d\u000a      effective life-cycle risk management; promulgating a maritime safety\u000d\u000a      culture; enabling safer shipping in a cost-effective manner and reducing\u000d\u000a      risks to life, property and the environment. International standards\u000d\u000a      developed at IMO form the foundation for national standards and rules of\u000d\u000a      related regulatory bodies, e.g. classification societies. The Executive\u000d\u000a      Vice President of Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines notes that \"Performance-based\u000aapproaches\u000a        to addressing maritime safety, in particular damage stability, provided\u000d\u000a        the foundation for innovative designs with demonstrable safety, achieved\u000d\u000a        cost-effectively. This has enabled a step change in the profession's\u000d\u000a        mind-set and practice in addressing maritime safety at large\"\u000d\u000a      (Source 1). To facilitate understanding of the new rules and the ensuing\u000d\u000a      safety regime, a series of CPD Workshops has been organised regularly by\u000d\u000a      NA-ME with participation from professionals worldwide.

The IMO's rules are the most\u000d\u000a      important international instrument addressing maritime safety today,\u000d\u000a      covering such areas as ship design, construction and equipment,\u000d\u000a      subdivision and stability, fire protection, radio-communications, safety\u000d\u000a      of navigation, carriage of cargoes (including dangerous cargoes), safety\u000d\u000a      management and maritime security. NA-ME research is promulgated through\u000d\u000a      IMO, National Regulatory Bodies, Classification Societies, ship designers\u000d\u000a      and builders, ship operators, and most importantly 2 billion passengers\u000d\u000a      and 1.5 million seagoing crew worldwide (Source 5). Performance-based\u000d\u000a      safety allows the introduction of safety as a design objective, which\u000d\u000a      leads to improving the overall performance of ships, i.e., better designed\u000d\u000a      and operated ships, finally, addressing safety rationally incentivises\u000d\u000a      safety investment and encourages a safety culture, leading in turn, to a\u000d\u000a      sustainable and continuous improvement (as evidenced in the SAFEDOR\u000d\u000a      Project website, Source 10).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research on the theoretical and experimental assessment of the stability\u000d\u000a      of damaged ships in the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine\u000d\u000a      Engineering from the mid-1990s to the present day has been pivotal in the\u000d\u000a      development, adoption and implementation of the latest amendment of the\u000d\u000a      International Convention on Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS 2009) by the\u000d\u000a      International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN body regulating maritime\u000d\u000a      safety.

The step change from deterministic to\u000d\u000a      probabilistic rules has been considered for around fifty years, but was\u000d\u000a      successfully implemented for the first time in SOLAS 2009, based on\u000d\u000a      knowledge developed over 17 years through initiatives spearheaded by The\u000d\u000a      Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering (NA-ME), involving\u000d\u000a      national and international research projects and working groups. These\u000d\u000a      regulations target risk reduction, aiming for zero tolerance of risk to\u000d\u000a      human safety.\u000d\u000a    Key Findings: After the 1987 capsize of the passenger-car ferry Herald\u000a        of Free Enterprise with the loss of 193 lives, a new approach and\u000d\u000a      numerical simulation tools were developed to study the behaviour and\u000d\u000a      capsizing of damaged passenger ships, which take into account progressive\u000d\u000a      flooding in waves as a function of time (Reference 1). After the capsize\u000d\u000a      and sinking of Estonia in 1994 with the loss of 853 lives, UK,\u000d\u000a      Germany, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark set up the Joint North West\u000d\u000a      European Project with the aim of understanding rapid capsize of\u000d\u000a      passenger-car ferries and developing improved survivability standards. In\u000d\u000a      this project, NA-ME researchers formulated the first performance-based\u000d\u000a      (quantitative) assessment of ship survivability, using first-principles\u000d\u000a      tools, representing a landmark contribution in the history of maritime\u000d\u000a      safety legislation. This research led to the establishment of a European\u000d\u000a      standard known as the `Stockholm Agreement' (Reference 2), the precursor\u000d\u000a      of performance-based approaches to safety that led to the development of\u000d\u000a      risk-based approaches and goal-based standards implemented in SOLAS 2009.\u000d\u000a    The cornerstone of the NA-ME contribution to maritime safety is the\u000d\u000a      introduction of techniques for measurement of safety using\u000d\u000a      first-principles tools to assess the safety performance of ships following\u000d\u000a      collision\/grounding and\/or large scale flooding in realistic operational\u000d\u000a      conditions. These techniques enable safety to be considered as a\u000d\u000a      quantitative design objective rather than an attribute achieved by rule\u000d\u000a      compliance, contributing to a fundamental shift in the perception of ship\u000d\u000a      safety. NA-ME research, funded by the UK Department of Transport through a\u000d\u000a      string of projects from 1995 to 2000, enabled determination of the\u000d\u000a      survival time (time taken for a ship to capsize) of damaged passenger\u000d\u000a      ships and the subsequent development of time-based survival criteria\u000d\u000a      (Reference 3), allowing the development of ship designs and arrangements\u000d\u000a      offering sufficient time for passengers to evacuate damaged ships. This\u000d\u000a      research led to second and third generation numerical models to assess the\u000d\u000a      survivability of damaged ships offering improved accuracy and flexibility\u000d\u000a      in handling any damage scenario, in conjunction with improved\u000d\u000a      computational speed. These technical developments, coupled with societal\u000d\u000a      demands for improved maritime safety deriving from major maritime\u000d\u000a      accidents (such as Estonia), led to the establishment in 1996 of\u000d\u000a      the Ship Safety Research Centre (SSRC), by Vassalos &amp; Turan, to\u000d\u000a      provide a focus for international collaboration on maritime safety\u000d\u000a      research, to support the implementation of the new standards being\u000d\u000a      introduced throughout Europe via the provision of numerical tools, the\u000d\u000a      development of experiment methodology, and provision of model testing\u000d\u000a      facilities. NA-ME thus played a key role in supporting the EU maritime\u000d\u000a      industry in re-designing existing ferries to the new standards. Between\u000d\u000a      2000 and 2003, the EU-funded projects ROROPROB (Probabilistic\u000d\u000a        Rules-Based Optimal Design of RoRo Passenger Ships, Ref:\u000d\u000a      G3RD-CT-2000-00030) and HARDER (RP1), initiated by NA-ME, provided the\u000d\u000a      foundation for SOLAS 2009. These projects were truly international,\u000d\u000a      involving European industry, research and regulatory bodies, IMO, the US\u000d\u000a      Coast Guard and Japan. The IMO Working Group, with support from the HARDER\u000d\u000a      project developed the harmonised regulations in draft form in 2004;\u000d\u000a      following various amendments for ease and consistency of implementation,\u000d\u000a      these entered into force in January 2009. NA-ME was involved in the\u000d\u000a      Working Group and played a pivotal role in the formulation of the SOLAS\u000d\u000a      2009 rules.\u000d\u000a    NA-ME has continued to spearhead the implementation of probabilistic\u000d\u000a      rules in practical ship design via a series of large-scale research\u000d\u000a      programmes (7 projects between 2009 and 2013 amounting to some &#8364;1.5M). In\u000d\u000a      addition, SSRC run SOLAS 2009 Passenger Ship Safety workshops to help\u000d\u000a      industry understand the fundamentals and the implementation of the new\u000d\u000a      rules to help ensure safer designs can be generated cost-effectively\u000d\u000a      (References 5 and 6). Research has also focussed on development of global\u000d\u000a      safety standards for damaged ships, to harmonise existing fragmented\u000d\u000a      regulations and replace prescriptive rules-based standards with a\u000d\u000a      performance-based approach.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers at Strathclyde at time of research 1994 - 2009:\u000d\u000a    Vassalos, D.

The industry-facing seminars\u000a      (e.g. JIT Club, SPEED, competitiveScotland.com) led to knowledge exchange\u000a      engagements with 102 companies across the UK and over 76 companies across\u000a      Europe, and involved the application of the frameworks and the associated\u000a      tools and techniques. In all cases, the research team engaged with the\u000a      management teams of the organisations through intensive workshops and\u000a      longer-term KTP type engagements, educating and facilitating the critical\u000a      evaluation of the organisations' performance measurement and management\u000a      practices. The resulting tools and techniques have now been adopted by a\u000a      wider community of support organisations ultimately impacting on over 1000\u000a      companies.\u000a    Type of impact:\u000a    Engagements with companies resulted in redefinition and redeployment of\u000a      the organisations' performance measures with more rigorous use of the\u000a      performance measurement system at all levels, aided through visual\u000a      management systems. This process, in many cases, was supported by more\u000a      effective use of existing, or introduction of new, ICT infrastructures\u000a      within the companies. Implementation of the frameworks and models devised\u000a      from the Strathclyde research resulted in:\u000a    \u000a      improved communication of organisational objectives and priorities at\u000a        all levels;\u000a      improved staff motivation, involvement and engagement at all levels\u000a      increased participation and innovation.\u000a    \u000a    The combination of these improvements led to sustainable growth in\u000a      revenues, productivity and cash-flow facilitated thorough more systematic\u000a      and focused customer service, and product\/service and productivity\u000a      improvement initiatives.\u000a    Reach and Significance\u000a    Some of the most significant benefits in productivity to be realised\u000a      during the REF period, through application of the Strathclyde research,\u000a      have been reported by Highland Spring, Clydesdale Bank, Blairs Windows,\u000a      Riley Dunn and Wilson, and Brian Hewitt Construction. In each company, the\u000a      performance measurement framework was implemented and used to assess the\u000a      status of their core capabilities against three core value drivers:\u000a      operational excellence, product leadership and customer intimacy.\u000a    Highland Spring Limited: The Strathclyde researchers helped\u000a      the company to obtain more relevant, timely, consistent and accessible\u000a      (ICT based) performance information. This facilitated more meaningful\u000a      strategic and operational interactions within the organisation, resulting\u000a      in more informed and confident decision making, as well as more focused\u000a      action at all levels. This resulted in improved efficiencies across sales,\u000a      manufacturing, materials and distribution operations, as well as improved\u000a      customers service levels, resulting in a 150% increase in turnover (from\u000a      &#163;54M to &#163;81M) and a 80% increase in the workforce (107 new employees) by\u000a      the end of 2009. Further acquisitions resulted in the business growing to\u000a      become the UK's number 1 bottled water producer with a turnover of c.\u000a      &#163;100M and 450 people (Sources 1 and 2).\u000a    Clydesdale Bank: Prior to engagement with Strathclyde, the\u000a      bank had implemented in-house productivity and customer focused\u000a      performance measurements, without achieving significant improvements. The\u000a      Strathclyde research team conducted a maturity assessment and then a pilot\u000a      intervention with two different teams, using one half of each team as a\u000a      control group. Approximately one year after the intervention the bank\u000a      reported 6% improvements in staff engagement, productivity and customer\u000a      service (Source 3).\u000a    Blairs Windows: A quick response manufacturing programme\u000a      was implemented which enabled the company to produce customised products\u000a      for their customers in very short turn-round times. This contributed to\u000a      the reputation of the company and customer satisfaction.\u000a    Riley Dunn and Wilson: The company benefited from a\u000a      business process re-engineering programme which stream-lined their book\u000a      binding processes, improving productivity and use of labour.\u000a    Brian Hewitt Construction: The Strathclyde researchers\u000a      assisted with the development and implementation of engineering systems to\u000a      enable the company to very quickly design and manufacture commercial\u000a      buildings. This was based on creating systems that would generate the\u000a      design of a new building through use of a library of design rules.\u000a    Wider impact\u000a    The European wide FP7 FutureSME project (2009-2013) led by the\u000a      Strathclyde team developed and delivered a &#8364;6M programme to improve the\u000a      competitive capabilities of European Manufacturing SMEs. The research\u000a      described above, and particularly the maturity models and the visual\u000a      performance measurement and management approaches, formed the foundations\u000a      of the project.

The compelling research question is \"what\u000a      performance measurement and management practices and behaviours\u000a      distinguish high performing organisations?\"\u000a    Key research findings: The new knowledge that underpins this\u000a      impact was developed through a series of EPSRC and EU funded research\u000a      projects between 1993 and 2013. Initial research conducted with industry\u000a      leaders ICI, GE Caledonian and Clyde Blowers Ltd identified performance\u000a      measurement and management as a key barrier to business-wide integration,\u000a      constraining overall performance [1].\u000a    Subsequent case study based research with 36 manufacturing companies\u000a      across Europe established that the measurement of business process\u000a      performance is a key requirement and highlighted the need to deploy\u000a      business process measures to the teams who operate (work in) these\u000a      processes [2]. The study also demonstrated the feasibility of using\u000a      reliability-engineering techniques to monitor and manage the performance\u000a      of business processes to ensure continuing stakeholder satisfaction [2].\u000a    Subsequent research resulted in the development of the new Integrated\u000a      Performance Measurement Systems Reference Model and identified Performance\u000a      Measurement as an information system within the Performance Management\u000a      Process [3 and 4]. This line of thinking led to further work that explored\u000a      performance management of business processes and process-based teams. The\u000a      key outcome of the research was that organisational performance is a\u000a      function of operational and strategic work flows (i.e. business processes)\u000a      comprising of people as well as machines, and that the measurement and\u000a      management systems should be organised and operated as such [4 and 5].\u000a    The work on process and people-focused performance measurement and\u000a      management systems continued and explored how performance may be measured\u000a      and managed in extended collaborative enterprises such as supply chains\u000a      and value chains. This led to a better understanding of performance\u000a      measurement and management challenges in collaborative enterprises [4].\u000a    The Strathclyde team also drew on their experiences developed through\u000a      parallel work (funded through the European Regional Development Fund) with\u000a      over 100 small and large organisations in the implementation of integrated\u000a      performance measurement systems. This led to identification of the\u000a      interplay between performance measurement, management styles and\u000a      organisational culture [5]. Further research concluded that performance\u000a      measurement and management practices of organisations are very much shaped\u000a      by the mental models and social forces within the organisation, and those\u000a      organisations with an holistic integrated understanding of the\u000a        managerial system perform better as they demonstrate better\u000a      tendencies towards learning and adaption to their environment [6].\u000a    Key Researchers: Prof. Umit Bititci (Senior Lecturer, 1996;\u000a      Reader, 2000; Professor, 2002); Dr Jillian MacBryde (Lecturer, 1998;\u000a      Senior Lecturer, 2004; Reader, 2011); Dr Kepa Mendibil (Researcher in 1998\u000a      and Lecturer since 2005); Dr Nuran Acur (Researcher 1998-2001, Senior\u000a      lecturer since 2008) all at the Dept. of Design Manufacturing and\u000a      Engineering Management, University of Strathclyde.

An 18 month R&amp;D project investigating\u000d\u000a      structural, material and flow aspects of fluid-end design was launched in\u000d\u000a      April 2010 (&#163;396k, funded by Weir SPM, Fort Worth, Texas, PI Prof D\u000d\u000a      Mackenzie). The project objective was to design and develop a new high\u000d\u000a      performance Oil &amp; Gas Well Service Pump fluid-end that would:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Extend product life under conventional well hydraulic fracturing\u000d\u000a        conditions.\u000d\u000a      Enable development of hard shale resources, which require\u000d\u000a        significantly greater fracking pressures than conventional wells.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The gross static (ductile) strength of the fluid-end was assessed by\u000d\u000a      employing the non-linear Finite Element Analysis methodology proposed in\u000d\u000a      references 1, 4, and 5. The fatigue life was improved through detailed\u000d\u000a      analysis of the pump internal geometry. A novel aspect of the new design\u000d\u000a      was to off-set the intersection between the horizontal and vertical bores\u000d\u000a      of the fluid-end, which results in lower intersection stresses than an\u000d\u000a      in-plane intersection. This effect had been researched for cross-bores in\u000d\u000a      cylindrical pressure vessels in Reference 3, but this is the first time\u000d\u000a      the concept has been applied to a fluid end configuration. Two patents are\u000d\u000a      pending for this novel design feature (United States Patent Application\u000d\u000a        Publications US 2010\/0144995 and 2010\/0183424, July 2012).\u000d\u000a      Further reduction in stress concentration was achieved through design by\u000d\u000a      analysis of the valve seat and valve seat deck, resulting in a new, long\u000d\u000a      life, patent-pending configuration (World Intellectual Property\u000d\u000a      Organisation, International Publication Number: WO 2013\/116488 A1).\u000d\u000a    A further major improvement in fatigue life was achieved through\u000d\u000a      specification of a new fluid end autofrettage procedure based on the\u000d\u000a      methodology proposed in Reference 6. This procedure ensures that the\u000d\u000a      optimum residual compressive stress is established in each individual\u000d\u000a      fluid-end cylinder, reducing local mean stress at highly loaded locations\u000d\u000a      and hence enhancing fatigue life. During the R&amp;D project, the\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde researchers worked closely with a Weir SPM design team in Fort\u000d\u000a      Worth, USA.

This includes investigation of the effects of material strain\u000d\u000a        hardening and large structural deformations on static ductile failure of\u000d\u000a        pressurised components. This work was used in the case study to\u000d\u000a        establish safe maximum working pressures for the fluid-end design.\u000d\u000a      Identification and quantification of the effect of local structural\u000d\u000a        discontinuity (design detail) on elastic stress concentration at\u000d\u000a        cross-bores in thick cylindrical pressure vessels [Refs 2, 3]. Research\u000d\u000a        showed that features reducing stress at one specific region could cause\u000d\u000a        increased stress at other locations: a global rather than local approach\u000d\u000a        is required to ensure overall stress reduction. Detailed computer\u000d\u000a        analysis provided quantitative information on reducing stress\u000d\u000a        concentration through off-setting cross-bores in thick cylindrical\u000d\u000a        vessels. This research informed design of the internal fluid-end\u000d\u000a        geometry in the case study and led directly to the new, patented offset\u000d\u000a        cross-bore design.\u000d\u000a      A methodology to optimise the autofrettage process for maximum fatigue\u000d\u000a        life of complex pressurised vessels was proposed. The location of the\u000d\u000a        maximum alternating stress, which limits the fatigue life of the vessel,\u000d\u000a        was found to change with the degree of the plastic deformation\/residual\u000d\u000a        stress induced by the autofrettage process. This new methodology [Refs\u000d\u000a        3, 6] tracks changes in the location of the limiting alternating stress\u000d\u000a        range with increasing autofrettage pressure.

The VRShips project demonstrated that the\u000a      VIP concept was viable\u000a      for supporting European shipbuilding by focussing on capturing industrial\u000a      requirements and needs,\u000a      and prototyping the initial platform. The focus within VIRTUE and SAFEDOR\u000a      was a fundamental\u000a      shift in product data management to satisfy the identified industrial\u000a      challenges and needs, and\u000a      implement the VIP in industry. This industrially driven implementation\u000a      ensured that the partners\u000a      had the responsibility to deliver the case study demonstrations; had\u000a      first-hand use of the VIP within\u000a      their organisations; applied the VIP to their own problems; and were\u000a      driven to exploit the\u000a      opportunities that the VIP provided within the context of the case studies\u000a      and also within further\u000a      use within their organisation. These organisations were, therefore,\u000a      adopting the research output\u000a      (the VIP), adapting their ways of working by integrating their design and\u000a      analysis tools into the VIP,\u000a      and subsequently improving the way they operate. The success of the VIP\u000a      development and more\u000a      importantly, the industrially-driven implementation is highlighted within\u000a      the VIRTUE final project\u000a      review relating to the VIP: \"The Reviewers are pleased that excellent\u000a        progress has been made and\u000a        many user requirements set up during the project have been included,\u000a        hence demonstrating large\u000a        functionality which is indicated through the large number of test cases\u000a        which have been provided\u000a        and shown by the partners\"; Source A.\u000a    Types of Impact: The VIP has been applied within the VIRTUE,\u000a      SAFEDOR and EuroVIP projects\u000a      by world-leading European ship design, engineering and project management\u000a      consultancies, that\u000a      undertake projects on an international scale including: Arsenal\u000a      (Portugal), Atkins (UK), ECN\u000a      (France), Friendship Systems (Germany), HSVA (Germany), Insean (Italy),\u000a      MARIN (Netherlands),\u000a      Principia (France), Sirehna (France), SSPA (Sweden), and ZIB (Germany).\u000a      Collaborative\u000a      applications have included (and were led by): wave resistance studies\u000a      (Scott Gatchell, HSVA),\u000a      hydrofoil design and optimisation (Christine de Jou&#235;tte, Principia),\u000a      propeller design (Scott Gatchell,\u000a      HSVA), sea-keeping (Christine de Jou&#235;tte, Principia), hull\/propeller\u000a      interaction (Francesco\u000a      Salvatore, Insean), and hull shape optimisation (Christophe Malibat,\u000a      Atkins). Through this industrial\u000a      implementation of Strathclyde's VIP, the enhancements to engineering\u000a      design practice are\u000a      exemplified through implementation in HSVA and MARIN. HSVA is a privately\u000a      owned service and\u000a      consultancy company with 21 shareholders, 90 employees, based in Hamburg\u000a      Germany with\u000a      customers worldwide. HSVA specialises in testing technology, methods,\u000a      standardisation and\u000a      numerical procedures to solve complex problems, and has a turnover of\u000a      &#8364;10-12M, 56% of which is\u000a      international. MARIN is an international leading provider of hydrodynamic\u000a      and nautical research\u000a      and development, based in Wageningen, The Netherlands, employing 350\u000a      people with an annual\u000a      turnover of &#8364;42M of which 85% is realised by commercial projects for the\u000a      international maritime\u000a      industry. Marin provides innovative design solutions and advanced research\u000a      to a wide range of\u000a      international customers. The implementation of the VIP has had the\u000a      following beneficial impact:\u000a      Improved efficiency: the VIP allows designers greater opportunity\u000a      to focus upon design and\u000a      analysis activities rather than the management of the process. Traditional\u000a      integration approaches\u000a      using technologies such as the Common Object Request Brokerage\u000a      Architecture were not end-\u000a      user oriented having a steep learning curve, were complex and hard to use\u000a      correctly, and resulted\u000a      in long development times and high defect rates (Henning, Source G). The\u000a      Strathclyde platform\u000a      delivered time savings with the same quality of delivery as other\u000a      approaches to meet customer\u000a      requirements, as exemplified by the comments from MARIN's R&amp;D Manager:\u000a    \u000a      \"It took only three hours for a first-time user to be familiar with\u000a          the platform, build up the\u000a          process and finish configuration.

The lack of effective\u000a      support by existing\u000a      solutions has been reported to cost the general US industry \"billions of\u000a      dollars\" (Szykman et al.,\u000a      Source E). The management required in order to overcome these challenges\u000a      exists within three\u000a      layers: conceptual, physical and data management. Previous research by\u000a      others has focussed on\u000a      defining product data standards which have required significant\u000a      development effort and expertise\u000a      for implementation, resulting with industrial uptake that had minimal\u000a      impact (Gielingh, Source F). In\u000a      contrast, the Virtual Integration Platform (VIP) is a transformative\u000a      platform that provides unique\u000a      support for the collaborative design and analysis of complex manufactured\u000a      systems such as ships\u000a      and aircraft, and provides an integrated solution to these challenges\u000a      through: translation and\u000a      transfer of product data between tools; user-centred integration support;\u000a      transaction management,\u000a      access and version control; and change notification. The VIP was the first\u000a      realisation of a\u000a      fundamental architecture for a maritime Integrated Design Environment that\u000a      would support\u000a      distributed design. It has been developed exclusively within Strathclyde\u000a      over a twelve year period\u000a      within a number of EU funded projects (see also Section 3):\u000a    \u000a      VRShips-ROPAX 2001-2005. The concept for the VIP was devised\u000a        exclusively within\u000a        Strathclyde, and the platform developed collaboratively between\u000a        Strathclyde (approx. 70%),\u000a        National Technical University of Athens (approx. 20%), and Instituto\u000a        Superior T&#233;chnico (approx.\u000a        10%). Dr Whitfield was the principal system architect for the duration\u000a        of the project.\u000a      VIRTUE 2005-2009. The evolution of the VIP was devised and developed\u000a        exclusively within\u000a        Strathclyde with Dr Wu being the principal developer and system\u000a        architect until 2007 and\u000a        subsequently Dr Whitfield from 2007-2009.\u000a      SAFEDOR 2005-2009. The VIP was devised and developed exclusively\u000a        within Strathclyde with\u000a        Dr Whitfield being the principal developer and system architect for the\u000a        duration of the project. It\u000a        was this version of the VIP that was used to achieve the impact\u000a        described herein.\u000a      EuroVIP 2011-2014. The focus of the EuroVIP project is the promotion\u000a        of collaboration and the\u000a        use of the VIP throughout industry, and not specifically VIP\u000a        development.\u000a    \u000a    Key findings: Research within Strathclyde on co-ordinating\u000a      distributed design resulted in the\u000a      creation of: a solution for ship product data integration [1]; a framework\u000a      and solution for distributed\u000a      design co-ordination [2, 3]; a solution for the management of distributed\u000a      design resources [4];\u000a      techniques for the management of extremely large design models [5]; and, a\u000a      platform for integrated\u000a      risk and cost-based design [6].\u000a    The first development of the VIP within the VRShips project implemented a\u000a      generic integration\u000a      solution for over twenty ship design and analysis tools to support\u000a      through-life design. The VRShips\u000a      innovation was a radical modelling solution for structuring and managing\u000a      the volume of engineering\u000a      product data for complex manufactured systems such as ships; the project\u000a      also resulted in the\u000a      creation of a generic integration tool for design and analysis software\u000a      aimed at ship designers\u000a      rather than commercial software developers. These two solutions provided\u000a      the core functionality\u000a      that was needed to support the through-life design of ships [4]. The\u000a      solution was unique in that no\u000a      other product data management solution provided this level of integration\u000a      within the industry\u000a      without being reliant on cumbersome product data and integration\u000a      standards. The project\u000a      demonstrated that the VIP concept was viable and highlighted the need for\u000a      a number of\u000a      enhancements that required further research to broaden the scope of\u000a      industrial implementation.\u000a      The VIP evolved within the VIRTUE project which focussed on integrating\u000a      Computer Aided Design\u000a      (CAD) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools and providing solutions\u000a      to physical, and\u000a      data management interoperability challenges. One of the greatest\u000a      challenges related to the\u000a      management of extremely large CFD datasets, which required the creation of\u000a      a novel distributed\u000a      data management solution that automatically propagated design change and\u000a      maintained\u000a      consistency of multiple versions of ship product data. The platform\u000a      evolved through close industrial\u000a      engagement (by an implement\/test\/evolve cycle) to support more efficient\u000a      and effective\u000a      collaborative design.\u000a    SAFEDOR demonstrated that first principle CAD and analysis tools could be\u000a      integrated into the\u000a      VIP to change the way that ships were designed and optimised for safety.\u000a      This represented a\u000a      radical change to the design process: adopting goal-based optimisation,\u000a      rather than rule or\u000a      regulation based design. Evolution of the VIP also demonstrated that a\u000a      novel \"dependency\u000a      network\" could provide a more effective way of supporting decision making\u000a      relating to the design\u000a      process, and provide more user-centric support for managing and\u000a      visualising the exchange of\u000a      product data than would otherwise be possible within more conventional\u000a      workflows.\u000a    Key researchers within the Department of Design, Manufacture and\u000a      Engineering Management,\u000a      University of Strathclyde were Prof A.H.B.

Results and recommendations from\u000d\u000a      the laboratory studies on wave impact were published as guidance by HSE in\u000d\u000a      2005 (Wave Slap Loading on FPSO Bows, Source 6). The results from\u000d\u000a      the SAFEFLOW and FLOW JIP projects were published as Summary\u000d\u000a        Report on Design Guidance and Assessment Methodologies for Wave Slam and\u000d\u000a        Green Water Impact Loading (Source 7). These documents are still the\u000d\u000a      most detailed and up to date guidance for the design of Floating Offshore\u000d\u000a      Platforms against wave impact. The guidance covers wave loading on the\u000d\u000a      hull, deck and deck mounted equipment. Whilst Safety Cases for offshore\u000d\u000a      platforms in the UK sector of the North Sea are not based on mandatory\u000d\u000a      guidance, industry would be expected by the regulators to refer to the HSE\u000d\u000a      and SafeFlow guidance. The two guidance documents underpinned by\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde research have been used to design (or redesign) offshore\u000d\u000a      structures to ensure safe operation, thus reducing the risks to the vessel\u000d\u000a      crew, and the risks of oil spillage to the environment, and loss of oil\u000d\u000a      supply to the public, whilst reducing economic losses to oil producers.\u000d\u000a    The Strathclyde research on waves and wave impact has directly informed\u000d\u000a      the oil industry and regulator sponsors; furthermore, through Barltrop's\u000d\u000a      membership of the standards committees has informed the ISO standards (19904-1\u000d\u000a        Floating Offshore Structures (Source 8),19902 Fixed Steel\u000d\u000a        Offshore Structures (Source 9) for offshore oil and gas platforms.\u000d\u000a      Barltrop also contributed to the International Electrotechnical Commission\u000d\u000a      IEC TC 88, which developed IEC\/BS standard 61400-3 Wind turbines &#8212;\u000d\u000a        Part 3: Design requirements for offshore wind turbines (Source 10)\u000d\u000a      incorporating guidance on wave loading, published in 2009.\u000d\u000a      Barltrop is currently working on the revision of both the ISO and IEC\u000d\u000a      documents, providing essential reference for the safe design of fixed and\u000d\u000a      floating offshore structures in the fields of oil, gas and wind energy.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Marine and Offshore Design and Safety:\u000d\u000a      In 2010 the Schiehallion FPSO bow impact loading was\u000d\u000a      reassessed for BP by Atkins and Strathclyde, using the Strathclyde simple\u000d\u000a      rule formulae and both the Strathclyde and Marin time domain models. This\u000d\u000a      structure has subsequently operated safely until 2013 in the\u000d\u000a      Schiehallion field, West of Shetland. (Source 1) The cost of the lost\u000d\u000a      production due to 10 days downtime due to the damage incurred in 1999 was\u000d\u000a      estimated to be about $35 million. The Strathclyde and Safeflow research\u000d\u000a      has been the basis for the estimation of bow loading on the Schiehallion\u000d\u000a      replacement vessel. This has been approved by BP, accounting for the\u000d\u000a      HSE\/Safeflow guidance and data from the Strathclyde\/ Atkins 2010\u000d\u000a      wave impact studies. The replacement vessel (likely to cost in the region\u000d\u000a      of $2-3 billion) is currently in-build and will be installed in 2014\u000d\u000a      (Source 1).\u000d\u000a    The series of circular FPSO vessels designed by Sevan Marine ASA Oslo,\u000d\u000a      were designed according to this guidance based on input to design\u000d\u000a      consultants British Maritime Technology (BMT). This series of vessels\u000d\u000a      including Hummingbird (launched in 2008) and Voyager\u000d\u000a      (launched in 2009), now owned by Teekay Shipping, are still\u000d\u000a      operating. Each of these vessels are worth around $US 0.5-1 billion\u000d\u000a      (Source 2).\u000d\u000a    Knowledge gained from Strathclyde research has been used by Barltrop in\u000d\u000a      the assessment of safety of the structure during possible impact loading\u000d\u000a      on the deck of the North Rankin-A fixed platform off Western Australia for\u000d\u000a      Woodside Petroleum in 2009. Value of the North Rankin Platform is\u000d\u000a      estimated to be worth around $2-3 billion. Work by Barltrop contributed to\u000d\u000a      the decision that the platform could continue to operate safely (Source\u000d\u000a      3).\u000d\u000a    In 2009 a damaged wave screen protecting the ferry berths in\u000d\u000a      Kirkwall Harbour, Orkney was subsequently assessed and redesigned using\u000d\u000a      results, from Barltrop based on software developed for the SAFEFLOW\u000d\u000a      project (Source 4). The value of this wave screen installed is estimated\u000d\u000a      to be &#163;300k; its presence has both a societal and financial benefit by\u000d\u000a      allowing ferry operations to access and remain in the harbour in more\u000d\u000a      severe weather for about 20% more time.\u000d\u000a    The expertise has also been exploited to examine and provide guidance on\u000d\u000a      wave load and wave impact for safe design of offshore wave energy devices;\u000d\u000a      namely the Naval Dynamics AS device, designed in 2008 and the\u000d\u000a      Aquamarine Oyster II built in 2011 and currently undergoing full\u000d\u000a      scale testing at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in the UK.\u000d\u000a    Influence on legal proceedings:\u000d\u000a      The oil tanker Prestige sank after breaking in half in 2002 off\u000d\u000a      the coast of Galicia, causing one of the most damaging oil spills in\u000d\u000a      history, with a clean-up cost estimated at &#8364;2.5 billion. In October 2012 a\u000d\u000a      Spanish court opened the trial of the former captain and three other\u000d\u000a      defendants over their involvement in the oil spill. The main defendant is\u000d\u000a      the captain of the Prestige, against whom prosecutors are seeking a\u000d\u000a      12-year prison sentence. Besides pursuing criminal charges, prosecutors\u000d\u000a      are demanding financial compensation from the ship's insurers to cover the\u000d\u000a      costs of the spill. The Spanish state raised its total claim to about\u000d\u000a      &#8364;4.33 billion, from an initial estimate of &#8364;1.9 billion. France has so far\u000d\u000a      claimed &#8364;86 million in damages.\u000d\u000a    Based on his wave impact research, Barltrop was asked to write expert\u000d\u000a      reports (from 2009 to 2012) and to give expert testimony in the Spanish,\u000d\u000a      Galicia Region, High Court, in 2013. In court there were two experts on\u000d\u000a      hydrodynamics: Barltrop and another from Spanish Model Basin (Cehipar).\u000d\u000a      Results of the Strathclyde research played an important role in explaining\u000d\u000a      the nature of the waves, wave loading, structural response and the\u000d\u000a      interpretation of the model test results. Of particular importance, owing\u000d\u000a      to the effects of air in the water, on the basis of his research, Barltrop\u000d\u000a      argued that the scaling factors applied by Cehipar were only 60% of the\u000d\u000a      correct values. This evidence is highly significant as it indicates the\u000d\u000a      hull strength must have been 66% higher than was implied by the Spanish\u000d\u000a      tests. This indicates a properly, rather than poorly, maintained hull and\u000d\u000a      this will affect the court's decision as to the cause of and\u000d\u000a      responsibility for pollution and clean-up costs (Source 5). Court\u000d\u000a      judgement is expected in before the end of 2013.\u000d\u000a    Wider impact:\u000d\u000a      Research impact has been through the development of guidance and\u000d\u000a      standards, use of these guidance and standards by other parties, and\u000d\u000a      through consultancy and expert evidence by Prof Barltrop and Prof Incecik.\u000d\u000a      The guidance and standards provide better understanding and quantification\u000d\u000a      of the response of the shell plating of FPSOs and conventional tankers due\u000d\u000a      to wave impact loads which in turn enables the designers to manage the\u000d\u000a      risk of oil pollution and possible loss of life due to shell rupture.\u000d\u000a      Inevitably, we only know the detail of a small proportion of the overall\u000d\u000a      application of the standards and guidance: i.e. applications in which\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde researchers have had some direct involvement.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Guidelines and standards underpinned by Strathclyde research have\u000d\u000a      improved the design, assessment and the safety of marine structures\u000d\u000a      subjected to wave impact in large steep waves. The guidelines and\u000d\u000a      standards are widely used in the design of floating structures,\u000d\u000a      particularly Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessels (FPSOs)\u000d\u000a      and offshore wind turbines.

The guidelines and\u000d\u000a      standards are used by designers to mitigate against damage caused by\u000d\u000a      breaking wave impact, thereby improving the safety of mariners and\u000d\u000a      offshore workers, reducing lost production due to downtime, and cutting\u000d\u000a      the risk of environmental impact due to oil pollution.

The proposals were\u000d\u000a      triggered by Barltrop' s observation that Health and Safety Executive\u000d\u000a      (HSE) `guidance notes', he had written previously for offshore structures,\u000d\u000a      needed further research in order to properly address wave impact. The FPSO\u000d\u000a      Schiehallion was proposed as a test case, as it had been damaged in\u000d\u000a      1999 by wave impact in severe conditions, confirming that existing\u000d\u000a      approaches to design and construction of FPSOs and estimation of wave\u000d\u000a      loading were inadequate.\u000d\u000a    Key findings:\u000d\u000a      An extended program of research was subsequently performed for BP which\u000d\u000a      continued from 2001 to 2003 under the EU SAFEFLOW project in\u000d\u000a      parallel with the Industry-funded FLOW Joint Industry Project and\u000d\u000a      PhD research. Barltrop supervised research on instrumented three-metre\u000d\u000a      models of the curved bow Schiehallion and conventional tanker Loch\u000a        Rannoch that were tested in the Kelvin Hydrodynamics Laboratory with\u000d\u000a      all data analysed by Strathclyde. In parallel, a flat bow was tested in a\u000d\u000a      large test tank operated by MARIN (Maritime Research Institute\u000d\u000a      Netherlands), with data analysis carried out by researchers from\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde and Atkins. The Strathclyde study was validated by comparison\u000d\u000a      with full scale data obtained from Schiehallion.\u000d\u000a    Further insight into the importance of reflected waves on impact loads\u000d\u000a      was gained through a research study undertaken in conjunction with the\u000d\u000a      University of Glasgow in 2004-2005 on the effect of large waves impacting\u000d\u000a      Shetland cliffs. A subsequent CFD study (2005-2009) investigated the\u000d\u000a      nature of deep-water breaking waves, vessel motions, global loads on hull\u000d\u000a      structures, and local pressure loads caused by extreme wave impact events.\u000d\u000a    A further programme of CFD and acoustic-based research was funded between\u000d\u000a      2009 and 2013 by insurance companies, via lawyers, addressing the loss of\u000d\u000a      the tanker \"MV Prestige\" as a result of a breaking wave impact. The\u000d\u000a      Prestige sank in 2002 causing extensive pollution, especially to Spain's\u000d\u000a      NW coast. This work considered side impact and the effect of air in water\u000d\u000a      on impact pressures. Related studies using the techniques developed have\u000d\u000a      been carried out by Barltrop, Huang and Incecik (2000-2004) on wave impact\u000d\u000a      loading on wind turbine structures, funded by EPSRC (2000-2004), and on\u000d\u000a      ship side impact by Day and Barltrop (2010-2012).\u000d\u000a    The key findings of the research all relate to the development of better\u000d\u000a      insight into the phenomena related to wave impact on floating structures.\u000d\u000a      In particular the findings lead to improved understanding of the\u000d\u000a      probability of extreme wave impact (Section 3: Reference 1and 2, G1, G4),\u000d\u000a      the types of wave leading to the greatest loads (Reference 1 and 3, G1),\u000d\u000a      the effect of detailed hydrodynamics (including surface tension and\u000d\u000a      aeration) on wave impact loading (Reference 3), the significance of the\u000d\u000a      role of wave reflection in loading (Reference 4) the importance of added\u000d\u000a      mass effects in the fluid-structure interaction (G4), the importance of\u000d\u000a      \"green water on deck\" phenomena (G4), and the effect of water depth (G3).\u000d\u000a    The research also led to development of simplified equations and time\u000d\u000a      domain simulations for impact pressures suitable for use in design, and\u000d\u000a      improved estimates for safety factors for 100-year return period wave\u000d\u000a      impacts (Reference 2, G1, G4)\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers at Strathclyde\u000d\u000a      The key researchers were employed in the Dept. of Naval Architecture and\u000d\u000a      Marine Engineering at the time of the research.

Through a partnership of\u000a      complementary expertise between the departments of Chemical &amp; Process\u000a      Engineering (CPE) and Pure &amp; Applied Chemistry (PAC) within the\u000a      University of Strathclyde, a major collaborative Knowledge Transfer\u000a      Partnership (KTP) with Carron Phoenix was established. The specific aim\u000a      was to create a new range of synthetic granite kitchen sinks, enabling the\u000a      company to sustain its position in the higher-end designer kitchen sink\u000a      market across Europe and compete in markets worldwide. The initial work\u000a      was undertaken by the company through an EPSRC CASE studentship with PAC\u000a      which operated from 2002-2005 and led to the development of novel polymer\u000a      nanocomposite formulations with mechanical, thermal and barrier properties\u000a      superior to the base polymers. Such innovative formulations offered the\u000a      potential of significant benefits to Carron Phoenix Ltd in terms of\u000a      process flexibility, enhanced product performance and reduced wastage.\u000a    Following promising results in establishing the underlying polymer\u000a      chemistry, a wider and considerably more major expansion of the project\u000a      via a KTP programme (Source A) was established in January 2005 involving\u000a      specialists in chemical and process engineering in CPE as well as chemists\u000a      in PAC, which was followed by a Short KTP (sKTP) collaboration between the\u000a      company and the University, over the period 2009 - 2010. These knowledge\u000a      transfer programmes brought together the complementary expertise of the\u000a      Strathclyde chemists (Pethrick, Liggat) and chemical engineers (Schaschke)\u000a      with technologists at Carron Phoenix Ltd (Dennis, Hunter, Mackintosh). The\u000a      main engineering focus was to ensure that the prior chemistry findings\u000a      could be fully translated and scaled-up as an industrial production\u000a      process that delivered a consistent high quality product.\u000a    Nature of the Impact:\u000a    Improved manufacturing process\u000a    The KTP projects consolidated the findings of the preliminary research by\u000a      providing a full evaluation of the chemical processing practices as well\u000a      as material and energy audits. From a detailed understanding of the\u000a      mixing, reaction characterization, heat and flow properties, a radically\u000a      new approach was devised for all aspects of the process operation,\u000a      including the reallocation of labour, reduced process times, increased\u000a      mould tool usage and major capital investment in automation (Source A).\u000a    Process acceleration and automation created new challenges in terms of\u000a      control of the flow behaviour of the composite sink formulation during the\u000a      final curing step. In particular, more rapid heating rates led to greater\u000a      sedimentation of the fillers resulting in product defects. Detailed and\u000a      extensive chemical and processing studies were required in terms of\u000a      formulation, cure characteristics, flow and thermal properties of the\u000a      nanoclay materials. This provided the necessary platform for the\u000a      development of a completely new process with the successful commercial\u000a      production of high-end designer synthetic kitchen sinks sold worldwide.\u000a      The research enabled the team to identify a suitable type and\u000a      concentration of nanoclay filler and rheology modifier to allow control of\u000a      a) the mixing and distribution of materials, b) the effective transfer of\u000a      the mix, and c) heating and curing rate, to produce synthetic sinks free\u000a      from warpage and surface blemishes and thus reduce wastage from spoiled\u000a      products. Prior to this project, it had been necessary to re-work moulded\u000a      kitchen sinks in such a way as to avoid warpage and product spoilage. The\u000a      company is forthright in its acknowledgement of the criticality of the new\u000a      formulation: \"The nanoclay influenced the processability significantly\u000a        and enabled us to introduce the new process technology with its\u000a        significant savings. No nanoclay - no new process at that time, it is as\u000a        \"simple\" as that\", (Source B, Head of R&amp;D, Carron Phoenix\/Franke\u000a      PL Colour).\u000a    Production efficiency and cost savings\u000a    The implementation of the changes to the process enabled by the new\u000a      nanocomposite formulation resulted directly in considerable production\u000a      efficiency gains through the reduction of raw materials wastage, the\u000a      reduction in manufacturing time and the significant reduction of landfill\u000a      costs of failed and out-of-spec products. These savings alone amounted to\u000a      in excess of &#163;1 M annually, significantly in excess of the 25% target\u000a      defined for the project. Franke's Sustainability Report 2011 notes that:\u000a    \"Our production processes mainly use electricity and natural gas. We\u000a        have experienced that the combination of process and technological\u000a        improvements result in major energy savings....In Falkirk, United\u000a        Kingdom, the energy required for the moulding of granite composite could\u000a        be reduced by 20 % per annum with an innovative process called \"Rapid\u000a        Energy Distribution\" (Source C p.19).\u000a    Competitive advantage to the company\u000a    By creating superior, high quality products and reducing production\u000a      costs, the research outcomes from this project have enabled the company to\u000a      maintain its international business and market share in the higher-end\u000a      designer kitchen sinks. The company has been able to use these efficiency\u000a      savings to sustain its drive to maintain the economic viability of the\u000a      Falkirk site relative to other competitive options. In 2010, Franke the\u000a      parent company, subsequently established Carron Phoenix in Falkirk as the\u000a      Group Competence Centre for composite sink technology, due in part to the\u000a      strong research and development brought about by the incorporation of\u000a      nano-composite technology. This has secured both major employment for 170\u000a      workers in the composite sink division at the Falkirk site and retained\u000a      the associated supply chain infrastructure supporting further employment\u000a      locally and nationally (Source D).\u000a    Investment\u000a    The successful research outcomes from this project were further supported\u000a      by internal company investments securing significant investment in new\u000a      automated production facilities with a capital investment of approximately\u000a      &#163;4 million. These were installed in 2008 and 2009 to incorporate the new\u000a      nanocomposite technology with the production and sale of over one million\u000a      kitchen sinks by Carron Phoenix. This resulted in generating income in\u000a      excess of &#163;50M for the company as well as generating support for the\u000a      associated supply chain involved and contributing to the UK economy\u000a      generally.\u000a    Ongoing collaboration\u000a    The Carron Phoenix company remains in regular contact with researchers at\u000a      Strathclyde, using facilities such as the Advanced Materials Research\u000a      Laboratory. Schaschke and Liggat provide training courses on polymer\u000a      chemistry and process technology for company staff. Skilled researchers\u000a      from the University have transferred to posts in the industry; a PhD\u000a      graduate from the Liggat research group, and an MEng graduate from\u000a      Chemical &amp; Process Engineering have been employed by Carron Phoenix\u000a      since 2012.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Initial research into polymer nanocomposites and their formation took\u000a      place at Strathclyde from 2000 - 2010.

Together with licencing and significant royalty costs, the\u000a      company sought expertise to develop new alternative quality products.\u000a      Through &#163;268k of KTP funding between 2004 and 2010, the research involved\u000a      initially carrying out a full evaluation of the chemical processing\u000a      practices, as well as material and energy audits. Detailed understanding\u000a      of the mixing of materials, reaction characterization, and heat and flow\u000a      properties was also achieved. This led to a radically new approach to\u000a      processing, which influenced how the workforce was deployed, with the\u000a      changes fully implemented by the company in 2009.\u000a    Key findings:\u000a    The research outputs [3,4] detail how information was obtained on the\u000a      cure rates and viscosity of polymer-clay nanocomposites that are formed\u000a      through in-situ polymerisation. The nature of the dispersion of\u000a      clay platelets in a resin composite plays an important role in the process\u000a      of enhancement of the physical properties of that material. Reference 3\u000a      examines how different modifiers and the quantity of surface treatment for\u000a      the Cloisite&#174; range of organically modified clays affect properties in in\u000a        situ polymerised poly(methyl methacrylate). Another clay, which is a\u000a      mixture of rod- and platelet-like minerals, was also investigated to\u000a      understand how the shape of the clay particles can affect the polymer\u000a      properties. Five different clays, including Cloisite 30B and Cloisite 15A,\u000a      were dispersed using ultrasound and the cure of the samples was monitored\u000a      using the Strathclyde Rheometer. Rheology, transmission electron\u000a      microscopy and X-ray diffraction were used to determine that a good level\u000a      of clay dispersion was achieved. The mixed mineral formed the most stable\u000a      dispersion seen from settling tests. The cure accelerated in the presence\u000a      of organoclay, although the affect was less pronounced at higher\u000a      temperatures. The glass transition temperature was increased by 20 &#176;C with\u000a      only a few weight percent of clay, and water uptake was not adversely\u000a      affected.\u000a    This research was crucial in allowing the team to fully characterise and\u000a      optimise the new production process and to identify suitable nanoclay\u000a      fillers and rheology modifiers to allow control of the main processing and\u000a      materials characteristics that influenced the manufacturing process: i)\u000a      the mixing and distribution of materials, ii) effective flow properties,\u000a      and iii) heating and curing rates. Understanding and control of these\u000a      properties was crucial for the production of synthetic sinks free from\u000a      warpage and surface blemishes, and so was central to improvements in the\u000a      efficiency of manufacture and in the reduction of wastage from spoiled\u000a      products.\u000a    To meet the company's overall objective of achieving a 25% reduction in\u000a      production costs, the research project was presented with significant\u000a      technological challenges. The trilateral research partnership between the\u000a      company and Strathclyde's Chemists and Chemical Engineers was central to\u000a      the successful design of the new production process leading to the new\u000a      materials being extensively trialled for two years before becoming part of\u000a      the company's standard production process in 2009.\u000a    Key Researchers:\u000a    The research in process and product development of polymer-based\u000a      synthetic granite kitchen sinks was based on the complementary expertise\u000a      of chemical engineers and chemists at the University of Strathclyde\u000a      together with engineers and chemists at Carron Phoenix Limited, based in\u000a      Falkirk, Scotland.\u000a    Department of Chemical &amp; Process Engineering (CPE): Prof Carl\u000a      Schaschke (August 1990 to present).

Note that prior to IE\u000d\u000a      an earlier University spin out company, Advanced Power Sources (APS), was\u000d\u000a      established and carried out developmental work, however, this predates the\u000d\u000a      impact period for the REF and hence details are not included here.\u000d\u000a    IE currently employs some 350 personnel [5.1] and it is\u000d\u000a      anticipated by the company that this will rise to 400. The majority are in\u000d\u000a      the UK (Loughborough), with other bases in the US, Japan and India. In\u000d\u000a      2011\/12, shareholder investment was in excess of &#163;100M since\u000d\u000a      incorporation.

Strong links and\u000d\u000a      collaboration exist between LU and IE on fluid transport, fuel cell\u000d\u000a      control and system integration, materials, reliability, etc [5.1].\u000d\u000a      The company has conducted numerous projects with LU covering, for example,\u000d\u000a      fluid flow, materials, vehicle control, reliability, and heat transfer,\u000d\u000a      and fully expects such collaborative agreements to continue in the future\u000d\u000a      [5.1].\u000d\u000a    The research into thin metal bi-polar plates, the techniques that obviate\u000d\u000a      the need for external humidification and those that prevent the build-up\u000d\u000a      of contaminants, as cited in s2 and s3, came to fruition in first APS's\u000d\u000a      and then IE's development of fuel cell stacks and vehicles. The research\u000d\u000a      findings underpin the work to make fuel cells and their vehicles `real\u000d\u000a      world'.\u000d\u000a    In 2008, a 70 kW IE fuel cell system powered Boeing's inaugural flight of\u000d\u000a      the world's first manned fuel cell aircraft [5.4]. In the same\u000d\u000a      year a three-year Technology Strategy Board funded partnership with PSA\u000d\u000a      Peugeot Citroen culminated in the H2Origin hybrid battery and a 10 kW fuel\u000d\u000a      cell powered van that had a 300 km range [5.5].\u000d\u000a    By 2011 the partnership with Suzuki led to a major breakthrough, the fuel\u000d\u000a      cell powered Burgman scooter that achieved `whole vehicle type approval'.\u000d\u000a      It is the first (and to date) only fuel cell vehicle to achieve the\u000d\u000a      certification approving it for production and sale in Europe. Vehicles\u000d\u000a      such as prototypes or demonstrators that do not have this status must be\u000d\u000a      inspected and tested one by one. In summer 2012 IE announced a 50:50 joint\u000d\u000a      venture &#8212; Smile FC System Corporation, based in Japan &#8212; with Suzuki Motor\u000d\u000a      Corporation to manufacture air-cooled fuel cell technologies for various\u000d\u000a      industries [5.6].\u000d\u000a    Funding from the UK's Technology Strategy Board enabled a major\u000d\u000a      collaboration between IE and Lotus Engineering, LTI Vehicles and TRW\u000d\u000a      Conekt. The result was a zero emission fuel cell hybrid London taxi that\u000d\u000a      had all the features and functionality of a diesel taxi [5.7]. It\u000d\u000a      can operate for a full day without the need for refueling, is capable of\u000d\u000a      achieving a top speed of over 80 mph, refuels in about five minutes and\u000d\u000a      produces no emissions other than water vapour. A fleet of five hybrid fuel\u000d\u000a      cell taxis were deployed to transport VIPs around the capital during the\u000d\u000a      2012 Olympics, with hydrogen refuelling stations at Heathrow Airport and\u000d\u000a      in the City of London [5.8]. In 2012, a partnership was formed\u000d\u000a      with the global multi-industry consultancy Ricardo, which gives each other\u000d\u000a      the status of `preferred supplier' as they further the development and use\u000d\u000a      of fuel cell systems.

This section summarises the underpinning\u000d\u000a      research since 1993.\u000d\u000a    The research was supported by various sources including the EPSRC, DSTL\u000d\u000a      and industry. The focus was on high power density and on making fuel cells\u000d\u000a      small enough, light enough and robust enough to enable zero-emission\u000d\u000a      vehicles to operate viably. The context was &#8212; and remains &#8212; a desire for\u000d\u000a      zero-emission (at the tailpipe) vehicles with an attractive range, rapid\u000d\u000a      refuelling and ability to cope with impure hydrogen fuel and the effects\u000d\u000a      of city (and battlefield for the military) air.\u000d\u000a    The Loughborough team constructed the UK's first kilowatt-level PEM fuel\u000d\u000a      cell stack in 1995 and launched a University spin out company, Advanced\u000d\u000a      Power Sources (APS). By 2001 private finance capital had been attracted to\u000d\u000a      invest in a new company, Intelligent Energy (IE), which acquired APS and\u000d\u000a      secured an irrevocable, worldwide licence to exploit the fuel cell related\u000d\u000a      know-how of APS. It was the first UK company established to specifically\u000d\u000a      address the development and commercialisation of PEM fuel cells.\u000d\u000a    Researching and developing methods of preventing CO (carbon monoxide)\u000d\u000a      contamination on both the fuel (anode) side and the air (cathode) side is\u000d\u000a      a key challenge pursued at Loughborough. CO is present in the city\u000d\u000a      environments zero emission vehicles will travel in, at least during the\u000d\u000a      first few years until the benefits from using such vehicles are realised.\u000d\u000a      The research looked at the design, evaluation and modelling of a CO\u000d\u000a      selective oxidation reactor in 1996-2000 [3.1]. On behalf of the\u000d\u000a      military, the research also encompassed the effects of battlefield\u000d\u000a      contaminants on the performance of PEMFCs in 1995-1998 [3.2].\u000d\u000a      Battlefields can also contain high levels of CO that can impair the fuel\u000d\u000a      cell's performance. The research also led to advanced techniques for\u000d\u000a      purging the anode side of the fuel cells in the stack, which results in\u000d\u000a      the avoidance of the build-up of any contaminants present in the hydrogen\u000d\u000a      fuel allowing cheaper, industrial grade hydrogen to be used.\u000d\u000a    Early prototype fuel cells produced at LU had cylindrical geometry, later\u000d\u000a      evolving to cuboidal. The breakthrough was the creation of thin,\u000d\u000a      lightweight, metallic bi-polar plates that enabled the use of the fuel\u000d\u000a      cells in transportation [3.3, 3.4]. These achieved the best power\u000d\u000a      density in the world as the result of low volume bipolar plates coupled\u000d\u000a      with novel low-weight cooling methods [3.5].\u000d\u000a    The research also discovered advanced humidification techniques that\u000d\u000a      obviate the need for external humidification, a major saving in space and\u000d\u000a      weight for the fuel cell system package; an extremely important factor in\u000d\u000a      transportation applications in 2000 [3.6].\u000d\u000a    Loughborough University's key researchers in this work were: Dr. Phil\u000d\u000a      Mitchell (PhD and Lecturer 1980 until 1998 at LU, now Chief Technology\u000d\u000a      Officer of IE); Dr. Paul Adcock (PhD and Senior Lecturer 1984 until 2001\u000d\u000a      at LU, now Director of Research of IE); Dr. Chris Dudfield (PhD and\u000d\u000a      Research Associate 1993 until 2001 at LU, now Technical Director &#8212;\u000d\u000a      Corporate Development of IE); Dr. Jon Moore (PhD and Research Associate\u000d\u000a      1992 until 2001 at LU, now Communications Director of IE); Dr. Simon\u000d\u000a      Foster (PhD and Research Associate 1993 until 1995 at LU, now Technology\u000d\u000a      Specialist of IE); Prof. Rui Chen (PhD, Research Associate, now professor\u000d\u000a      at LU 1999 to present).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43226","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The growing incidence of osteoarthritis and osteoporosis associated with\u000d\u000a      the increase in the aging\u000d\u000a      population presents a significant challenge in healthcare delivery.

It\u000d\u000a        allowed investigation of the consequences of process changes and further\u000d\u000a        supported a number of process improvements to A350-XWB spar manufacture\u000d\u000a        which have enabled us to achieve satisfactory part quality in production.'\u000d\u000a    Specifically, the new analytical model supported the following two GKN\u000d\u000a      process improvements, generated to prevent the occurrence of wrinkling\u000d\u000a      defects during the A350-XWB spar development process:\u000d\u000a    (a) Manufacturing tools were introduced offset from the free edge of the\u000d\u000a      spar laminate to keep consolidation pressure away from this edge. This\u000d\u000a      effectively gave a vacuum channel around the spar edge and allowed the\u000d\u000a      fibres and resin to move into this gap, thereby preventing wrinkling.\u000d\u000a    (b) The most critical influence was shown to relate to the viscosity of\u000d\u000a      the resin material and therefore a hot de-bulk was introduced into the\u000d\u000a      composite cure cycle to minimise viscosity during this period of maximum\u000d\u000a      consolidation.\u000d\u000a    Wrinkling defects can lead to wholesale rejection of the part. Hence\u000d\u000a      these process improvements contribute to the achievement of current (one\u000d\u000a      aircraft per month) and future (13 per month) production rates, where each\u000d\u000a      aircraft spar has an equipped (unequipped) value of approximately &#163;1M\u000d\u000a      (&#163;100k).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The A350-XWB is the first Airbus airliner to have composite wings,\u000d\u000a      thereby reducing structural weight compared with the current generation of\u000d\u000a      metallic wings. With over 700 orders for the aircraft, the company has\u000d\u000a      placed great emphasis on the need to maximise performance benefits whilst\u000d\u000a      mitigating risk associated with manufacture of the all-new wing.

The subsequent bi-level approach [2] showed\u000d\u000a      that the stacking sequence, and hence laminate bending stiffness, of plies\u000d\u000a      was of secondary importance to achieving the desired thickness of each\u000d\u000a      fibre orientation, i.e. membrane stiffness. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) was\u000d\u000a      used to establish discrete laminate solutions satisfying buckling and\u000d\u000a      strength requirements. This was subsequently extended to include\u000d\u000a      manufacturing constraints associated with a three-bay panel [3] to\u000d\u000a      maximise ply continuity between adjacent panels of different thickness\u000d\u000a      with a single, repeating sequence of plies, i.e. maintaining fixed\u000d\u000a      percentages of each fibre orientation.\u000d\u000a    Low defect manufacture of A350-XWB rear spar\u000d\u000a    Context: The laminated rear spar is made in 3 sections,\u000d\u000a      each circa 10 m long and comprising complex shape and thickness variation.\u000d\u000a      It is manufactured by robotic (Automated Fibre Placement) layering of 6.25\u000d\u000a      mm wide, 0.25 mm thick tows (tapes) containing unidirectional carbon\u000d\u000a      fibres, pre-impregnated with uncured epoxy resin, over a male tool surface\u000d\u000a      in a bandwidth of up to 100 mm. During the lay-up process, stacks of plies\u000d\u000a      are consolidated at moderate temperature and pressure to remove trapped\u000d\u000a      air between layers, forcing them to accommodate the imposed geometry of\u000d\u000a      the tool. If these plies are prevented from slipping over each other,\u000d\u000a      localised ply buckling or wrinkling can occur. Such wrinkling defects\u000d\u000a      promote delamination, which can reduce the strength of the complete spar\u000d\u000a      by up to 60%, leading to costly part rejection or, worse still,\u000d\u000a      compromised component safety. Improvements in the process that reduce\u000d\u000a      defect occurrence were hitherto empirically-driven.\u000d\u000a    Underpinning research: The massive influence of\u000d\u000a      manufacturing processes on the performance of laminates became apparent to\u000d\u000a      Butler in 2011 when he undertook a part-time Royal Academy of Engineering\u000d\u000a      Industrial Secondment at GKN Aerospace. During this period, he co-edited a\u000d\u000a      special Royal Society issue, appearing in 2012 [4], and realised that the\u000d\u000a      nonlinear modelling techniques for geological folding developed by\u000d\u000a      mathematicians and engineers at Bath [5] could be adapted to model the\u000d\u000a      pre-cured consolidation of laminates within the manufacturing process, and\u000d\u000a      to predict the critical conditions for wrinkle occurrence. This led to a\u000d\u000a      Bath-GKN sponsored one-year Knowledge Transfer Fellowship, from October\u000d\u000a      2011 to October 2012, for Dodwell during which geological folding models\u000d\u000a      were adapted to predict fibre wrinkling during manufacture of laminated\u000d\u000a      composite components using fundamental mechanics and energy minimisation\u000d\u000a      techniques [6]. Much of this fellowship was undertaken at the GKN office\u000d\u000a      of the National Composites Centre with visits to GKN's A350-XWB spar\u000d\u000a      manufacturing facility during the pre-production development phase.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43228","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The University's research into novel, highly structured materials in the\u000a      form of hollow fibre and\u000a      monolithic adsorbents has led to products and processes aimed at energy\u000a      efficient gas separation\u000a      and purification, meeting legislative emission limits, creating healthier\u000a      workplaces, and recovering\u000a      valuable resources for reuse.

The company's business is in the supply\u000a      of advanced carbon\u000a      materials for separations, reactions and environmental protection. One of\u000a      MAST's products is the\u000a      low pressure drop activated carbon monolith (ACM). Bath's research on\u000a      ACMs, which was carried\u000a      out in collaboration with MAST from 1997, stemmed from the University's\u000a      original research on\u000a      inorganic adsorption monoliths in 1996 and led to the development of a new\u000a      process to recover\u000a      (VOCs) in the factory workplace. The European patent naming Crittenden and\u000a      MAST staff as\u000a      inventors of this new process was granted in 2008 [F].\u000a    Alongside invention and development of the new process, Bath's research\u000a      also led to\u000a      improvements to the design of the company's ACMs which are used within the\u000a      process.

By researching nano-porous\u000a      internal structures set\u000a      within optimised external structures, the aim has been to obtain high\u000a      separation performance but at\u000a      a very much reduced pressure drop. Low pressure drops are desirable\u000a      because less energy is\u000a      consumed to perform each gas separation or purification. In turn, less\u000a      carbon dioxide associated\u000a      with primary energy provision would be released into the natural\u000a      environment. Adsorbents are\u000a      most commonly available in granular form. Energy is lost, manifested as\u000a      pressure drop, as gases\u000a      are passed through vessels containing such materials. Pressure drop occurs\u000a      from skin friction\u000a      (energy loss as gas flows over material surfaces) and via form drag\u000a      (energy loss as gas flows\u000a      through tortuous paths around granular materials). For granular materials,\u000a      form drag is much\u000a      higher than skin friction. The University's research has been directed at\u000a      designing materials that\u000a      eliminate as much form drag as possible and hence the focus has been on\u000a      structured materials\u000a      that comprise straight channels, in the form of hollow fibres or\u000a      monoliths, thereby eliminating\u000a      tortuous gas flow paths.\u000a    Key researchers: The following academic staff in the Department of\u000a      Chemical Engineering's\u000a      Advanced Materials &amp; Porous Solids Research Group have been in post\u000a      throughout both the\u000a      research and the REF periods: Professor BD Crittenden (Group Leader &amp;\u000a      Professor throughout),\u000a      Dr TJ Mays (Lecturer to 2002, Senior Lecturer from September 2002) and Dr\u000a      SP Perera (Lecturer\u000a      to 2004, Senior Lecturer from September 2004). In addition, Professor ST\u000a      Kolaczkowski (Professor\u000a      throughout) was involved in some of the initial research.\u000a    Nature of the research insights or findings: Results from\u000a      fundamental research, published\u000a      between 1998 and 2000 [1, 2], revealed considerable promise for the\u000a      University's novel monolith\u000a      concept. This early research soon led to industrial interest and\u000a      collaboration with a range of\u000a      industrial organisations through an EPSRC\/DTI LINK grant awarded in 1997\u000a      to develop activated\u000a      carbon monoliths (ACMs) that could be used to capture volatile organic\u000a      compounds (VOCs) within\u000a      factory environments. The LINK project aims were to improve health in the\u000a      workplace, meet\u000a      legislative emission limits, and recover solvents for reuse within the\u000a      factory. The principal\u000a      collaborator was MAST Carbon Ltd (now MAST Carbon International Ltd). A\u000a      key research finding\u000a      made by the University was that the new straight channel monolith\u000a      materials could compete\u000a      equally in terms of separation performance with their granular\u000a      counterparts but with the major\u000a      advantage of a substantially reduced pressure drop [3]. The LINK project\u000a      created a new\u000a      commercial process that won the Severn Trent Water Safety Award at the\u000a      Institution of Chemical\u000a      Engineers Gala Awards in 2002. US and European patents for this new\u000a      process, on which MAST\u000a      and Bath staff are named as joint inventors, were granted in 2005 and\u000a      2008, respectively.\u000a      Supported by EPSRC in 2004-2007, the University continued to pursue\u000a      fundamental research\u000a      aimed at understanding how the ACMs were able to perform so well. For\u000a      example, it was important\u000a      to determine how the hundreds of flow channels in a monolith would perform\u000a      as a collective set [4].\u000a    The route to commercialisation included Teaching Company Scheme (TCS),\u000a      Technology Strategy\u000a      Board (TSB), and Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) projects with MAST\u000a      Carbon. TCS project\u000a      4211 (2003-2005) was rated Grade 1 `excellent' and led to publication of\u000a      TCS Case Study No.\u000a      6003. TSB project K3510G (2007-2010) was awarded so that demonstration\u000a      units of the new VOC\u000a      recovery process could be tested in the field. This TSB project (&#163;2.3\u000a      million total value) involved\u000a      the University's researchers, MAST Carbon Ltd, Wellman Defence Ltd and\u000a      four other industrial\u000a      companies. KTP project 7128 (2009-2011) was shortlisted at the IChemE Gala\u000a      Awards in 2010.\u000a    Research success with the monolith structures stimulated further\u000a      fundamental research on low\u000a      pressure drop materials at the University from around 2003, leading to the\u000a      patented invention of\u000a      hollow fibres that incorporate functional materials [5, 6]. This research\u000a      led, inter alia, to the\u000a      invention of an electrically regenerable adsorption unit for air\u000a      purification and for VOC removal and\u000a      recovery. The University's research on the new fibres was recognised by\u000a      the Royal Society which\u000a      made its highly prestigious Brian Mercer Award for Innovation to Dr Perera\u000a      in 2007. The patent\u000a      rights have now been assigned by the University to the spin-out company\u000a      (n-psl) whose sole\u000a      business is founded on the University's hollow fibre inventions. The novel\u000a      fibres invented at the\u000a      University are finding their main use in compressed air treatment where\u000a      the potential is to reduce\u000a      energy consumption by 50% over existing methods because the pressure drops\u000a      are so low. A\u000a      Carbon Trust project with Bath and n-psl in 2008-2009 concluded that the\u000a      reduced energy\u000a      consumption would translate into a minimum accumulated saving in emissions\u000a      of CO2 of over 4\u000a      million tonnes by 2050.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43229","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The context of the Bath research is concisely stated by the Chief\u000d\u000a      Executive of PPMA [A], prior to the assessment period, who indicates that\u000d\u000a      the consideration of climate change, packaging waste legislation and\u000d\u000a      economics leads to the conclusion that the use of thinner packaging\u000d\u000a      materials is advantageous, particularly if achieved without a significant\u000d\u000a      reduction in packaging machine performance.\u000d\u000a    The impact achieved has been in a number of inter-related areas.\u000d\u000a    Modelling of machine-material interaction: The Bath research has\u000d\u000a      generated new computer-based models to represent the complex interaction\u000d\u000a      between machines and materials during processing.

This has led to the creation of a design methodology that has\u000d\u000a      been incorporated into a design tool called FORMIT. As part of the\u000d\u000a      collaboration, HayssenSandiacre has used the tool to define `non-symmetric\u000d\u000a      shoulders', which was not previously possible.

The size of the world market for\u000d\u000a      packaging machinery is around &#8364;20bn of which 2% is associated with the UK\u000d\u000a      (EUROPAMA website). Companies often design and manufacture this machinery\u000d\u000a      on an evolutionary basis, so that the reasons for successful operation and\u000d\u000a      the potential limitations on performance are not well understood.\u000d\u000a    Key research\u000d\u000a    There has been extensive interaction with SMEs, end users and research\u000d\u000a      associations involved with packaging, processing and pharmaceutical\u000d\u000a      equipment. Interest has focused on the modelling and improvement of the\u000d\u000a      interaction between machines and the material and products that are\u000d\u000a      processed. Carton board has distinct non-linear material properties and\u000d\u000a      behaviour that may vary significantly with moisture content. When folded,\u000d\u000a      it is liable to delaminate; a fundamental understanding of this process,\u000d\u000a      [1], is central to the design and set-up of the manufacturing equipment.\u000d\u000a      Machine design is particularly difficult because the properties of the\u000d\u000a      processed material vary with ambient temperature and humidity. It is\u000d\u000a      therefore necessary to understand or, at least, bound their effects [2].\u000d\u000a      An understanding of the non-linear mechanical properties enabled the Bath\u000d\u000a      researchers to be the first able to undertake realistic simulation of\u000d\u000a      machine operation, including the prediction of failure [3]. This was a\u000d\u000a      major contribution that enabled operating conditions for existing machines\u000d\u000a      to be established for the avoidance of failure. This in turn informed the\u000d\u000a      development of improved design procedures [4].\u000d\u000a    Vertical form-fill-seal (VFFS) machines are used to package products in\u000d\u000a      film for almost 40% of packaged product worldwide. The key part of this is\u000d\u000a      the `forming shoulder', which takes the film from a roll, turns it back on\u000d\u000a      itself to form a tube. When sealed across its width, the tube is formed\u000d\u000a      into bags and product is then introduced. Although the geometry of the\u000d\u000a      shoulder needs to be precisely defined to avoid damage to the film, the\u000d\u000a      requirements have been poorly-understood and the industry has used various\u000d\u000a      semi-empirical `rules of thumb' to decide the form of a shoulder. The Bath\u000d\u000a      research identified the five main parameters needed to determine the\u000d\u000a      shoulder geometry. With this understanding, other forms of shoulder design\u000d\u000a      are now possible [5]. An approach for designing shoulders for new\u000d\u000a      applications has been established and incorporated in a software tool,\u000d\u000a      which allows designers to create usable designs through the use of a\u000d\u000a      formal methodology. More recent work has succeeded in relating the pull\u000d\u000a      force needed to take film over a shoulder and in experimental\u000d\u000a      determination of the factors affecting the sealing of films. The research\u000d\u000a      has overcome major barriers and led to the use of thinner, lightweight\u000d\u000a      packaging materials.\u000d\u000a    The results of the research have been encapsulated into a guide and a\u000d\u000a      workbook, [6], intended for industrial professionals in the packaging\u000d\u000a      sector to help them assess and improve their packaging operations. The\u000d\u000a      research began in 2001 and is still on-going.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43230","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Ford Motor Company sold 1.4 million cars in Europe in 2012. It builds\u000a      the 1st and 3rd best selling cars in the UK. The\u000a      upcoming EU fleet average CO2 emissions legislation will impose\u000a      a levy of &#8364;95 per gCO2\/km above a fleet average of 95gCO2\/km\u000a      by 2020. This challenging requirement would cost a company the size of\u000a      Ford &#8364;5.3bn if no improvement were evident from 2011 fleet average\u000a      emissions levels. Clearly this is commercially untenable hence every car\u000a      manufacturer has had to put into place a process to develop technologies\u000a      and enhancements to meet these requirements by improving fuel efficiency\u000a      incrementally each year. Crucially, though, these technologies must be\u000a      commercially affordable if car manufacturers are to be in a position to\u000a      maintain profitability.\u000a    The technological and commercial needs have resulted in a powerful\u000a      research imperative to develop and assess cost effective technologies that\u000a      can effect measurable reductions in CO2. The need for improved\u000a      products is self-evident. The need for improved processes arises because\u000a      the level of CO2 saving offered by individual enhancements is\u000a      typically small and often masked by the measurement imprecision typical of\u000a      industrial laboratories. Improved precision is needed if product\u000a      enhancements are to be demonstrated to be cost effective. The research at\u000a      Bath has been uniquely able to contribute to improvements in both product\u000a      and process. It was conducted in partnership with the Ford Technical\u000a      Collaborations Group, which commissions and manages research on behalf of\u000a      engineering teams within the whole Ford structure. The findings of the\u000a      research are then passed directly to those groups and feed into current\u000a      practice and future model development programmes.\u000a    Improving the precision of CO2 measurements\u000a    A project in partnership with Ford and co-funded by the Bath KTA\u000a      (2010-2012) developed and extended the techniques demonstrated by the\u000a      research at Bath [3] in such a way that they could be adopted in the\u000a      commercial setting of the Ford vehicle emissions laboratories at the\u000a      Dunton Technical Centre. Ford engineers, assisted by Bath researchers,\u000a      incorporated the findings of the high precision CO2 measurement\u000a      research into everyday practice for the benefit of fuel consumption\u000a      evaluation. The target was to double the level of precision, thereby\u000a      allowing engineers to rapidly establish the benefits of increasingly small\u000a      design changes to the vehicles. This target has been successfully achieved\u000a      and has been instrumental in the development of the Transit and the\u000a      Econetic range of vehicles. The Econetic range sold 550,000 vehicles in\u000a      Europe in 2012, representing nearly half of Ford's European sales [A].\u000a    The Director of Vehicle Evaluation &amp; Verification at Ford commented\u000a      [B]:\u000a    `The [Bath research] project has accelerated the improvements\u000a        to reduce variability in test measurements of fuel consumption and\u000a        emissions. As consumption and emissions fall, any benefits become\u000a        increasingly difficult to measure, which is why this project has been so\u000a        useful. By making our test procedures more discriminating, it allows our\u000a        development engineers to make best use of our facilities. Some of these\u000a        improvements have been carried over to other labs, particularly in\u000a        Germany and the United States.'\u000a    In 2012 Ford committed to a multi-million $ investment in the vehicle\u000a      emissions laboratories at its Dunton Technical Centre. The findings of the\u000a      Bath research on improving CO2 measurement precision were used\u000a      to justify this investment [D].\u000a    Product improvement\u000a    The research findings from the parasitic losses research gave Ford the\u000a      information needed to utilise variable flow oil pump technology, giving a\u000a      3% reduction in CO2, in a production engine for the first time.\u000a      This engine, the 1.0L EcoBoost, was launched in 2012 and was the winner of\u000a      both the 2012 and 2013 International Engine of the Year award [C], judged\u000a      by an international panel of automotive journalists. In addition, the high\u000a      precision measurements made possible by Bath research were able to\u000a      demonstrate that a custom oil formulation further improved the efficiency\u000a      of this engine, giving an additional 1% improvement in efficiency [6].\u000a    The 1.0L EcoBoost engine achieved sales of over 100,000 in 2012, its\u000a      first year of production, with an increasing sales trajectory. This engine\u000a      is fitted to most of the Ford range from the Fiesta to the C-Max and will\u000a      go into the Mondeo in 2013. The Fiesta and Focus achieved UK sales that\u000a      made them the first (109,665 cars) and third (83,115 cars) best selling\u000a      cars in 2012 [A].\u000a    Describing the mechanism by which the impact has been generated, the\u000a      Director of Vehicle Evaluation &amp; Verification at Ford commented in\u000a      January 2013 [B]:\u000a    `Over the last ten years the relationship between Ford Motor Company\u000a        and the University has grown into one that is of significant benefit to\u000a        Ford...With the help of the EPSRC and the TSB, we have been able to\u000a        develop powertrain technologies and processes that are now influencing\u000a        our products. Work at [the University of Bath] gave us a head start in\u000a        developing a specific engine oil for our 1.0L EcoBoost engine which is\u000a        now \"International Engine of the Year\".'\u000a    The 2.2L Duratorq diesel engine, fitted to the Ranger and the Transit,\u000a      which was the International Van of the Year 2013, also benefitted from\u000a      improvements demonstrated in the research at Bath. The improved thermal\u000a      management techniques and designs aimed at reducing friction have\u000a      contributed to the creation of this engine. Transit sales alone totalled\u000a      129,200 in Europe in 2012 and sales of this engine will soon reach 300,000\u000a      per year. These engines are built at the Ford plant in Dagenham.\u000a    In summary, the impact of these improvements on the emissions generated\u000a      and the fuel economy seen by the vehicle owners is substantial. The 4%\u000a      improvement in fuel economy due to the variable flow oil pump and new\u000a      engine oil formulation reduced CO2 emissions by approximately\u000a      40,000 tonnes in 2012 based on 30,000 km per annum for trucks and 20,000\u000a      km for passenger cars. Based on &#8364;1.70 per litre, the reduction in fuel\u000a      used saved the owners nearly &#8364;25M across Europe with further savings due\u000a      to the vehicle classification into lower tax brackets [A].\u000a    Returning to the primary motivation for the research programme, the fact\u000a      that research at Bath has allowed Ford to implement cost effective changes\u000a      to its production vehicles reducing CO2 emissions by 4% has\u000a      significant commercial impact for Ford. The improvement in fleet average\u000a      CO2 performance is a key factor to the strategic imperative of\u000a      achieving the EU set target of 95 gCO2\/km.

In order to achieve this, a greater understanding of the factors\u000a      limiting precision in the measurement of CO2 produced by\u000a      vehicles was required. This also gave a greater precision in determining\u000a      fuel consumption as it is calculated from the CO2 measurement.\u000a      Research aimed at improving measurement precision was funded by Ford from\u000a      2001, initially to assess the instantaneous vehicle emissions on a second\u000a      by second basis and to understand how errors in measurement would affect\u000a      the final result over a standard driving cycle [1]. This work was carried\u000a      out on the newly commissioned, state-of-the-art chassis dynamometer\u000a      facility at Bath. The expertise gained from this research led to a\u000a      collaborative project with BP in 2004-2005 to undertake a fundamental\u000a      study of the effect of experimental disturbances on the precision of CO2\u000a      measurements [2, 3]. The key insight arising from this research was that\u000a      techniques developed for controlling manufacturing processes of mass\u000a      produced components could be used in an experimental environment. The work\u000a      quantified for the first time the influence of changes in experimental\u000a      conditions on measurement precision; this allowed the effects on fuel\u000a      efficiency due to incremental improvements in technology to be measured\u000a      reliably.\u000a    These experimental techniques were critical to the success of the\u000a      research into parasitic loss reduction. This experimentally intensive\u000a      research was carried out on a Ford production engine using an advanced\u000a      engine test research platform. A formal systematic method was developed to\u000a      characterise and robustly model the complex interactions between the\u000a      engine systems, i.e. heat exchange mechanisms, hydraulic systems,\u000a      mechanical and electrical subsystems, control strategies and combustion\u000a      processes. Among the technologies investigated by Bath were variable flow\u000a      oil pumping, an improved engine cooling system and improved lubricant\u000a      specifications, first through a joint project led by Ford and BP (DTI\u000a      project TP\/2\/5\/10036, 2005-2007) and followed by a project adding Mahle\u000a      Powertrain to the existing consortium (TSB project TP\/9\/LCV\/6\/I\/S0052K,\u000a      2008-2011). The research demonstrated that, with the right control\u000a      strategy, variable flow oil pumps are able to deliver precisely the right\u000a      amount of oil needed to protect the engine at any particular time thereby\u000a      saving energy, fuel and reducing CO2 [4]. Improving the cooling\u000a      system allows faster warm up of the engine, again reducing fuel use [5].\u000a      The improved lubricant blends demonstrated similar improvements by\u000a      reducing friction and pumping work within the engine [6].\u000a    Key findings from this research demonstrated that:\u000a    1. A novel design of an engine cooling and lubrication system, including\u000a      a variable displacement oil pump, provided a 4% fuel economy benefit [4,\u000a      5].\u000a    2. Novel engine and transmission lubricant formulations each demonstrated\u000a      a 1% fuel economy saving [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43231","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In 2009, a Knowledge Transfer Account (KTA) funded project between Bath\u000d\u000a      and Ashwoods Automotive, an Exeter based SME, was focused on the\u000d\u000a      optimisation of hybrid electric powertrains. It became clear that\u000d\u000a      realistic driver behaviour had a far more significant effect on CO2\u000d\u000a      production and fuel efficiency than that possible through design\u000d\u000a      improvements, as is the case in conventional vehicles.\u000d\u000a    Because of the importance of driver behaviour for all types of vehicles,\u000d\u000a      and following discussions between Bath and Ashwoods based on these\u000d\u000a      findings, a new product (Lightfoot&#174;) was created by Ashwoods\u000d\u000a      that incorporated the Universal Driver Aggression Algorithm (or UDAA)\u000d\u000a      which arose from the Bath research [5]. The development of this product\u000d\u000a      relied heavily on the Bath team to ensure that the full benefits of the\u000d\u000a      research findings could be realised. Ashwoods engineers were seconded to\u000d\u000a      Bath during the product development, ensuring effective knowledge exchange\u000d\u000a      and exploitation of the research.\u000d\u000a    Lightfoot&#174; was launched in 2011 through a new business\u000d\u000a      venture, Ashwoods Lightfoot, which owns the IP relating to the product,\u000d\u000a      creating three new jobs. The product is marketed to fleet operators of\u000d\u000a      light commercial vehicles. The system consists of a data processing module\u000d\u000a      and a driver display system that can be integrated into the existing\u000d\u000a      dashboard instrumentation and is connected over the mobile phone network\u000d\u000a      to Ashwoods' central servers. The system makes use of data readily\u000d\u000a      available from the vehicle's diagnostic computer. The data are processed\u000d\u000a      using the UDAA algorithm developed in the underpinning research both to\u000d\u000a      quantify driver aggression and to optimise gear shift strategy. This\u000d\u000a      approach allows Lightfoot&#174; to be fundamentally more effective\u000d\u000a      than competing products, which simply aim to indicate to the driver when\u000d\u000a      to change gear, due to its ability to modify driver behaviour in a robust\u000d\u000a      and universally applicable manner. This represents an important strategic\u000d\u000a      advantage to Lightfoot&#174;, significantly improving driver\u000d\u000a      acceptance and minimising the application support needed for each new\u000d\u000a      fleet user.\u000d\u000a    Lightfoot&#174; uses visual and audible feedback to drivers to\u000d\u000a      help them improve the fuel efficiency of their driving. In addition, the\u000d\u000a      system reports back to the fleet manager who oversees a ranking and\u000d\u000a      monitoring system to reward the best drivers and encourage those who need\u000d\u000a      to improve. The reduction in CO2 emissions is achieved solely\u000d\u000a      through behavioural improvements, with no modification to the vehicle\u000d\u000a      engine.\u000d\u000a    During the development phase, trials run on customer fleets by Ashwoods\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that Lightfoot&#174; saved an average of around 7% in\u000d\u000a      fuel\/CO2 when compared with baseline measurements across a wide\u000d\u000a      range of drivers and duty cycles. The savings were even higher for\u000d\u000a      exceptionally aggressive drivers and highly dynamic duty cycles; in these\u000d\u000a      cases savings of up to 20% were achieved [A, B]. In service, the product\u000d\u000a      has consistently returned a saving of at least 10% [C].\u000d\u000a    Lightfoot&#174; has been a commercial success and is the sector\u000d\u000a      leading product, winning a number of industry awards [D]. The work\u000d\u000a      undertaken by Bath, exploiting the underpinning research has been central\u000d\u000a      to this success. In the words of the Ashwoods Managing Director [C]:\u000d\u000a    `The innovative work of the PVRC has contributed directly to our\u000d\u000a        business. The novel driver aggression monitoring algorithms developed\u000d\u000a        with the University have helped our Lightfoot product to become the\u000d\u000a        leading offering of its class.'\u000d\u000a    The impact here is immediate and persistent. The beneficiaries are\u000d\u000a      Ashwoods Automotive, through increased sales (value of the 2,500 unit\u000d\u000a      sales to date are around &#163;625,000) and a rising profile within a new\u000d\u000a      product sector [C].\u000d\u000a    In addition, the six major fleet operators that use the technology have\u000d\u000a      gained significant reductions in fuel costs, valued at over &#163;83,000 per\u000d\u000a      month on the current number of installations. Over 50 subsequent trials\u000d\u000a      have now been run by large fleet operators with savings ranging from 8 to\u000d\u000a      23%. Northumberland County Council saved 13.5%, Coventry City council\u000d\u000a      12.7%, DAF 9.9%, and May Gurney 14.3%. User experience has been positive,\u000d\u000a      for example, Wiltshire County Council [E] states:\u000d\u000a    `We have improved our consumption by 8-10% on these vehicles. The\u000d\u000a        system is easy to manage, relies on the driver to drive correctly to\u000d\u000a        make the savings, and therefore does not take up officer time. As the\u000d\u000a        potential savings are significant, it is our intention to invest in\u000d\u000a        Lightfoot in the future.'\u000d\u000a    The largest user is Autoglass, which has adopted Lightfoot&#174; across\u000a      its entire fleet and has seen rapid and significant improvements. In the\u000d\u000a      words of the Autoglass Managing Director [F]:\u000d\u000a    `Within a couple of days of using the tool we see many of our drivers\u000d\u000a        go from spending 55&#8212; 60% of their time in the green zone to hitting 90%\u000d\u000a        and higher. Our savings in fuel costs speak for themselves. ...\u000d\u000a    ... Our technicians have really embraced the technology...We've even\u000d\u000a        seen some light-hearted competitiveness emerging when the manager\u000d\u000a        reports go up on the notice board every week.'\u000d\u000a    Fleet operators spend around 25% of their cash flow on fuel, so any\u000d\u000a      saving in this area can be passed on to the general public through a\u000d\u000a      reduced price of goods and services. The wider environment benefits\u000d\u000a      through reduced CO2 from the vehicle fleet are clear. The\u000d\u000a      annual impact of the 2,500 currently operational systems can be estimated\u000d\u000a      by considering the effect of a 10% saving relative to the current fleet\u000d\u000a      average CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles, estimated\u000d\u000a      in 2010 by AEA at 207.6 gCO2\/km across a fleet of 2500 vehicles\u000d\u000a      travelling an average of 25,000 miles each year [G]. The saving is in over\u000d\u000a      2,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.\u000d\u000a    Figures 1 and 2 show actual changes in driver accelerator pedal activity\u000d\u000a      before (Baseline) and after (Live) activation of Lightfoot&#174;.\u000d\u000a      These changes, represented as probability density distributions, give rise\u000d\u000a      to the savings determined in [G].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000aFig. 1: Accelerator pedal (throttle) activation probability density\u000d\u000a      before (Baseline) and after Lightfoot&#174; was activated (Live).\u000d\u000a      Note the shift towards lighter pedal activation when the device is active.\u000d\u000a      Fuel use is proportional to accelerator pedal position.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aFig. 2: Engine speed probability density before\u000d\u000a(Baseline) and after Lightfoot&#174; was activated\u000d\u000a(Live).

The project exploited the capability of a diesel\u000d\u000a      engine, coupled with a continuously variable transmission, to operate the\u000d\u000a      engine at its most efficient level at all times. It was found that the\u000d\u000a      strategy of optimising only for fuel efficiency led to low driver\u000d\u000a      acceptance, with the driver finding the vehicle unresponsive. This was a\u000d\u000a      major barrier to adoption, which motivated further research at Bathin this\u000d\u000a      field [1].\u000d\u000a    This led to an EPSRC funded research programme in collaboration with Ford\u000d\u000a      and Torotrak (GR\/K99664\/01, 1996-2000), using the insight gained during\u000d\u000a      the initial DTI project to improve driver acceptance. An extensive series\u000d\u000a      of fundamental experiments were performed to understand and quantify\u000d\u000a      driver perception during a wide range of simulated vehicle acceleration\u000d\u000a      scenarios.\u000d\u000a    An important conceptual parameter in this work was driver aggression,\u000d\u000a      which is a measure of the driver demand and the vehicle's ability to\u000d\u000a      respond. The resulting data allowed the formulation of models to describe\u000d\u000a      the driver's perception of vehicle behaviour. These models provided a\u000d\u000a      means of predicting driver response to novel engine control strategies,\u000d\u000a      for the first time defining a relationship between driver aggression and\u000d\u000a      fuel consumption [3]. This advance meant that vehicle driveability could\u000d\u000a      be included in the optimisation process, allowing the trade-off between\u000d\u000a      driveability and fuel consumption to be addressed during the simulation\u000d\u000a      phases of a vehicle development programme. This reduced the duration and\u000d\u000a      cost of the entire development process by reducing the number of\u000d\u000a      iterations required [2].\u000d\u000a    Research in this area was extended through driving experiments that\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that for some specific road conditions, for example,\u000d\u000a      stop-start urban traffic and ring roads with high permitted speeds and\u000d\u000a      many traffic islands, the most aggressive drivers use up to 50% more fuel\u000d\u000a      than the least aggressive [4]. This surprising finding has significant\u000d\u000a      implications for both traffic planners and for vehicle designers. Further\u000d\u000a      research in partnership with Mahle Powertrain applied the techniques\u000d\u000a      developed by the Bath team to understand the impact of real-world driving\u000d\u000a      behaviour on the accuracy of engine diagnostic algorithms. This resulted\u000d\u000a      in the development of an algorithm (Universal Driver Aggression Algorithm\u000d\u000a      or UDAA) to measure driver aggression [5]. An important aspect of the UDAA\u000d\u000a      is its inherent robustness across differing vehicle types and road\u000d\u000a      configurations. The UDAA offers a step change in vehicle management\u000d\u000a      technology as it is directly applicable across a wide range of situations\u000d\u000a      with minimal requirement for labour intensive fine tuning. The UDAA\u000d\u000a      subsequently inspired activity within a project in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Ashwoods Automotive as described below.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43232","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The specific cases (a) &#8212; (d) of section 1 fall under the general\u000a      categories of `Economic impacts'\u000a      and `Impacts on practitioners and professional services'.\u000a    (a) Gas turbine rim seal design advances\u000a      Siemens is a large global company with an Energy product group. It has a\u000a      vested interest in\u000a      manufacturing more efficient power generation products so as to increase\u000a      market share. Siemens\u000a      Industrial Turbomachinery employs 1,600 people in Lincoln for the design,\u000a      manufacture and\u000a      maintenance of gas turbines in the power ranges from 5 MW to 15 MW.\u000a      Research and design\u000a      innovations at Bath have had significant economic and environmental impact\u000a      at Siemens. The\u000a      impact has contributed significantly to the company's current level of\u000a      technology and\u000a      competitiveness in the power generation industry has helped to protect\u000a      jobs in Lincoln, supported\u000a      the local and wider UK economy, and has created greener technology with a\u000a      reduction in CO2\u000a      through improved engine efficiency. The knowledge transfer of the research\u000a      from Bath to Siemens\u000a      has been facilitated by a Knowledge Transfer Associate (Teuber).\u000a    (i) New rim seal components and improved thermal efficiency\u000a      \u000a      The Bath research [2, 3] has led directly to new rim seal components.\u000a      These patented component\u000a      designs ([A] and patent applications from Siemens: 2013P00020EP and\u000a      2013P00483EP, currently\u000a      embargoed) evolved through a carefully organised programme of interaction\u000a      between Siemens\u000a      and Bath, via a Knowledge Transfer Partnership. Economic impacts\u000a          have been evidenced\u000a        through improved products, jobs protected, and reallocation of\u000a          corporate budgets as the\u000a      Director of Future Technology within Siemens (Lincoln) states that an\u000a      improvement in thermal\u000a      efficiency of 0.4% has been confirmed [B]. Furthermore:\u000a    `Internal funding directly from Technology looking at the development\u000a        of seals and improved\u000a        secondary air systems analysis will be in the region of &#8364;1M-1.5M over\u000a        five years. To this I\u000a        would add the indirect effort that comes about through related engine\u000a        design and concept\u000a        development activity. Here we have ~4 to 5 people full time equivalent @\u000a        approx &#8364;1M\/annum.'\u000a    (ii) Changing and improving the design methods at Siemens\u000a      \u000a      The research at Bath has achieved impact on practitioners\/engineers\u000a          through changed and\u000a        improved design practices used at Siemens. Specifically, a\u000a      new theoretical model for rim seal\u000a      ingress has been developed at Bath and translated into a practical design\u000a      tool (used in 2nd Flow)\u000a      for the Siemens' secondary air system (SAS) [C]. It is stated in [B] that:\u000a    `Avoidance of a single instrumented engine test has reduced the engine\u000a        development budget by\u000a        over &#163;250k and the development programme by 3 months. Reduced lead times\u000a        for engine\u000a        development can be equated to additional opportunity for engine sales.'\u000a      and\u000a    `Increasing the life of these parts therefore makes the company's\u000a        service plans more attractive\u000a        to the customer and secures the jobs in its service organisation. Each\u000a        additional long term\u000a        service agreement secured is a sale valued at between &#163;250k and &#163;500k\u000a        per year for 5 to 10\u000a        years.'\u000a    Each additional sale of a 15 MW class engine represents a sale valued at\u000a      over &#163;5M. Siemens\u000a      branches in the USA, Sweden and Germany have validated their own SAS tools\u000a      and have\u000a      assessed 2nd Flow as the major SAS design tool [D]. This has\u000a      enabled Siemens to reallocate\u000a      corporate budgets towards research in the Energy sector.\u000a    (b) Design against runaway shaft thermal bending in rotating machines\u000a      The dynamic process of runaway shaft thermal bending, known as the Morton\u000a      Effect, was first\u000a      explained in reference [4]. Since that publication, design and field\u000a      engineers have reported\u000a      numerous instances of problematic turbomachines that were not meeting\u000a      specification due to\u000a      excessive vibration. These engineers now design against occurrence of the\u000a      Morton Effect by\u000a      reducing a thermal-orbit loop gain system parameter below a definable\u000a      threshold value. Impact of\u000a      this research is therefore evident through traceable references\u000a          from practitioners (engineers)\u000a        to reference [4]. Cases of the Morton Effect have been\u000a      reported through the\u000a      Pump\/Turbomachinery Symposia, organised by the Turbomachinery Laboratory,\u000a      Texas A&amp;M\u000a      University, and held annually in Houston. The Director of the\u000a      Turbomachinery Laboratory, who has\u000a      extensive industrial engagement with the oil and gas sector, comments [E]:\u000a    `After their work, a stream of papers appeared involving case studies\u000a        of real machines with\u000a        \"synchronously unstable\" vibration characteristics. The outcome was\u000a        comparable to the\u000a        discovery of a previously undiagnosed disease that &#8212; once recognized &#8212;\u000a        was found to be\u000a        widely distributed and now predictable, avoidable, and curable.'\u000a    (c) International standards for Active Magnetic Bearing (AMB) based\u000a        rotating machines\u000a      The group has led research into the rigorous design of active magnetic\u000a      bearing (AMB) control\u000a      strategies for the stable levitation of flexible rotors, and has addressed\u000a      the understanding of the\u000a      dynamics of rotor drop onto touchdown bearings [5, 6]. The impact of this\u000a      research is now evident\u000a      through its incorporation into new and modified professional\u000a          standards.\u000a    A degree of standardization was required following the early industrial\u000a      application of AMBs over the\u000a      1980s and 1990s, when failures were reported. Recognition of the Bath\u000a      research became evident\u000a      through invitations to serve on the International Organization for\u000a      Standardization (ISO)\u000a      TC108\/SC2\/WG7 AMB Project committee (Burrows, 1996; Keogh, 1998;\u000a      Sahinkaya, 2003) with\u000a      other academic researchers and industrial technologists from the USA,\u000a      Switzerland, Germany,\u000a      France, and Japan. Bath is now the only institution with three\u000a      representatives. This committee has\u000a      encouraged the expansion of applications from vacuum pumps, motors,\u000a      generators, flywheel\u000a      energy storage, to compressors for the oil and gas sector. The Bath group\u000a      pioneered the technique\u000a      of automatic balancing of levitated flexible rotors and has been central\u000a      to the understanding of\u000a      AMB touchdown dynamics that arise from rotor de-levitation. The Bath input\u000a      has been embedded\u000a      into the standard, ISO 14839 (Parts 1-4) [F]. Since 2009, Keogh has led\u000a      ISO\/TC108\/SC2\/WG7 as\u000a      Convenor and Part 4 was published in 2012. Beneficiaries include vendors\u000a      (S2M, MECOS,\u000a      Calnetix, Waukesha), original equipment manufacturers (Siemens, GE, Solar\u000a      Turbines, Edwards)\u000a      and end-users (Shell, Total, Statoil, Exxon). The Director of Technology,\u000a      Calnetix, states [G]:\u000a    `As Director of Technology of Calnetix, an innovation led company\u000a        based near Los Angeles,\u000a        USA, I know well that important technical issues must be overcome to\u000a        ensure that high\u000a        performance machines operate reliably and safely in their intended\u000a        environments. The input\u000a        from the Bath team has contributed significantly to the development of\u000a        rigorous standards for\u000a        AMB operation in a range of industrial applications. The performance\u000a        metrics required by the\u000a        standard are very useful and practical, enabling Calnetix to advance the\u000a        robustness of its\u000a        machine designs. This has helped Calnetix increase market penetration -\u000a        in fact, annual\u000a        revenues of Calnetix have tripled over the past five years.'\u000a    (d) Oil-free compressor design\u000a      International recognition of the Bath input is attested by the invitation\u000a      of GE Global Research\u000a      (Munich) in 2012 for the Bath team to design and deliver an experimental\u000a      facility for oil-free\u000a      compressor dynamic investigations. The research from Bath has also\u000a      underpinned collaboration\u000a      and impact with GE through knowledge transfer. The\u000a      Principal Engineer: Electric Drivetrain, GE\u000a      Global Research, states [H]:\u000a    `I was aware of the previous Bath AMB research into the control of\u000a        levitated flexible rotors. Such\u000a        rotors are pertinent to the oil and gas compressor rotors manufactured\u000a        by GE. A contract was\u000a        therefore arranged for Bath to design and deliver an experimental\u000a        rotor\/AMB facility to GE\u000a        Global Research (Munich) to enable investigation of the system\u000a        requirements for compressors,\u000a        particularly in subsea applications. Professor Keogh and Dr Sahinkaya\u000a        have since interacted\u000a        with and guided the GE engineering team from April 2012 to July 2013\u000a        through knowledge\u000a        transfer of the principles that are embedded within ISO 14839\u000a        guidelines.'\u000a    The experimental facility has been used to train five practitioners\u000a      (design engineers) for the\u000a      development of oil-free compressors.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Rotating machines are ubiquitous key elements for power generation.\u000a      Research has led to impacts\u000a      that have improved the design and performance of rotating machinery for\u000a      component vendors,\u000a      original equipment manufacturers and end-users:\u000a    (a) Siemens has adopted new designs of interstage turbine disc rim seals\u000a      that reduce gas\u000a      leakage paths and hence increase power efficiency\/fuel savings in power\u000a      based gas\u000a      turbines.

Die drawing (1,3,4), invented by Coates,\u000a      involves pulling solid polymers at temperatures above their glass\u000a      transition but below their melting point, through converging dies,\u000a      achieving controlled oriented structures: physical properties increase\u000a      monotonically with draw ratio (cross sectional area change imparted), and\u000a      selected oriented polymers exhibit useful shape memory behaviour (3). It\u000a      is applicable for all length scales (micro to macro products) and a wide\u000a      range of polymers and cross sections, including biaxially oriented tubes.\u000a      Initially a batch process, we first demonstrated continuous processing,\u000a      with industry (5), and have developed fundamental modelling of orientation\u000a      processing and deformation (6).\u000a    Tensile drawing of filled polymers normally leads to failure.\u000a      However, our fundamental understanding of the stress, strain and\u000a      strain-rate fields incurred in drawing polymers through convergent dies\u000a      (1), supported by multi length scale finite element analysis, showed that\u000a      it was possible to control cavitation around fillers to avoid catastrophic\u000a      failure, by simultaneously strengthening the polymer matrix through\u000a      molecular orientation and development of crystal continuity (4). By die\u000a      design, controlled cavitation (in a combined compressive normal stress at\u000a      the die entry, but increasing tensile axial stress through the die)\u000a      produces lower density products, and orientation causes higher product\u000a      strength and stiffness, allowing continuous, high-speed production\u000a      (~metres per minute) of controlled property products (see Dow\u000a      exploitation).\u000a    We developed a micro-scale version of the die drawing process for\u000a      bioresorbable materials based on modified filled polylactic acids,\u000a      exhibiting shape memory (through recovery of the controlled orientation),\u000a      suitable for cementless in-body fixations (see Smith &amp; Nephew\u000a      exploitation). Die drawing to a selected draw ratio allows matching of the\u000a      physical properties such as stiffness and strength of bone for joint or\u000a      soft tissue repair. The challenging requirement to have shape memory\u000a      activation at body temperatures has been addressed in our research and\u000a      patents.\u000a    This research has been supported commercially by BP, Solvay, Sabic, Dow,\u000a      Smith &amp; Nephew, Netlon Tensar, Bridon International, Nylacast, and\u000a      Arterius in programmes from 1995 to date, totaling ~&#163;1.25m.

The manufacturing techniques\u000a      pioneered at Bradford are today used to manufacture more than 150,000\u000a      points annually using the moulding facilities at the University and the\u000a      production facility in Sheffield. These are used by orthodontists in the\u000a      UK and the Netherlands and have received excellent feedback (see\u000a      testimonials on DRFP's website) (b). The technology has also gained FDA\u000a      approval in the US. This collaborative research work enabled DRFP to\u000a      launch its product in 2007 and the company has since grown from three\u000a      people in 2006 to 12 employees in 2013 based at a dedicated manufacturing\u000a      facility in Sheffield where the points are coated, packaged and shipped to\u000a      distributers in the UK, Holland and the USA (c).\u000a    There are several reasons why this product has proved so popular: it is\u000a      much simpler to use than conventional techniques; gives quick,\u000a      long-lasting results; and gives a better outcome for the patients. In 2007\u000a      a three-year clinical trial with annual check-ups for patients was started\u000a      using SmartPoint. Informal feedback based on cases that have been\u000a      monitored for in excess of three years has indicated the clinical results\u000a      are good with good healing and no complications (c). A user panel of\u000a      approximately 20 dentists has been set up to provide feedback on DRFP\u000a      products. To date, there have been over 1,200 cases documented with 14\u000a      failures (retreatment required). This failure rate of approximately 1%\u000a      compares favourably with typical retreatment\/failure rates taken from the\u000a      literature of 11-30% for endodontic procedures over a 5 year period. The\u000a      wide variation in the figures can be attributed to the broad range of\u000a      studies which consider a variety of problems to be treated and conditions\u000a      of the tooth. Informal feedback from various sources (customers, user\u000a      panel members, and the clinical trial) (d,e) indicates that patients\u000a      report low levels of post-operative pain, which was attributed to a less\u000a      \"aggressive\" procedure and the good healing attributes of the product. No\u000a      force is required to compact the obturation point into the prepared canal,\u000a      which can cause stress inside the tooth. Research studies completed by\u000a      dentists have also validated the functionality (f) and biocompatibility\u000a      (g) of the SmartPoint solution. The product now has a history of\u000a      use over five years with proven benefits as demonstrated in leading\u000a      dentistry journals, and this product is now in increasing demand in a\u000a      highly risk-averse marketplace.\u000a    There has been an increasing demand for the product from the dental\u000a      community in mainland Europe and UK and the product range has expanded\u000a      since SmartPoint first hit the market in 2008. The products have\u000a      been refined in this period and now include a radio-opaque coating in\u000a      addition to the core as a response to the requests of practitioners. The\u000a      technology has also won numerous awards (h,i,j).\u000a    The collaborative work is now concentrating on process scale-up due to\u000a      recent FDA approval opening up the North American marketplace. Critical to\u000a      this goal will be a significant increase in core output utilizing\u000a      multi-cavity tooling with improved process repeatability and better\u000a      product quality with tighter tolerances. The company continues to work\u000a      with the University to develop new solutions to the scale up requirement\u000a      including automated inspection and handling systems to increase quality\u000a      and throughput.\u000a    In addition, company employees are working in the University to manage\u000a      their own manufacturing process, which is the final stage in the knowledge\u000a      transfer process. They can configure, run and troubleshoot the\u000a      manufacturing process with minimal support required and implement their\u000a      own quality control procedures on site, which has seen significant\u000a      improvement in product yield throughout the process chain. This allows\u000a      Bradford University staff more time to spend developing new innovations to\u000a      improve quality and reduce costs.\u000a    In addition, the methods and processes developed during this work have\u000a      enabled the Centre for Polymer Micro and Nano Technology at the University\u000a      to explore further applications of these technologies and build bespoke\u000a      solutions for a range of other companies wishing to develop new\u000a      micro-injection moulded products. This work has provided significant value\u000a      as a key case study to showcase our ability to deliver research projects\u000a      that are near-market and, since this project, we have delivered over 20\u000a      new research and development projects with UK-based industrial Partners as\u000a      a direct result of the knowledge gained during this process. This work has\u000a      enabled the securing of Industrial R&amp;D-focussed, grant-funded\u000a      opportunities. Key examples include the ERDF-funded Nanofactory\u000a      programme which included Bradford in a consortium of six Yorkshire-based\u000a      Universities that has assisted over 100 small and medium enterprises in\u000a      the region, and the EU FP7 COTECH programme, which was a highly successful\u000a      25-partner programme (of which Bradford was a major RTD contributor) that\u000a      saw the creation of three key technology platforms and eight industrial\u000a      prototypes (k).\u000a    The underpinning research on polymers and the knowledge base available at\u000a      Bradford has been key to developing and manufacturing the SmartPoint\u000a      device. This device has brought benefits in terms of improved endodontic\u000a      treatments worldwide. This project has also enabled the Centre to build an\u000a      effective R&amp;D platform for completion of a range of other programmes\u000a      with Industrial partners.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A manufacturing process developed by Bradford researchers has\u000a      revolutionised the way endodontists perform root canal treatments.

Under the Directorship of Phil Coates (Professor 1993-present)\u000a      researchers involved included Dr Ben Whiteside (PDRA 2001-2006, Lecturer\u000a      2006-present), Keith Norris (Experimental Officer 2008-present), Dr Majiid\u000a      Actar (PDRA 2008-2009), Andrew Czencusz (Process Technician 2008-2010) and\u000a      John Wyborn (Process Technician 2009-present).\u000a    In 2006, researchers the Centre were approached by UK company DRFP Ltd.\u000a      to help it develop a new market for its hydrophilic polymer technology.\u000a      The company realised its hydrophilic polymer could be used to seal\u000a      irregular shaped spaces, such as root canals in endodontistry, but was\u000a      struggling to find a partner who could make the necessary core material to\u000a      enable this application. The Centre was able to offer the company\u000a      significant expertise in material selection and compounding, ultra high\u000a      precision moulding, in-line process monitoring (4) and high-resolution\u000a      product characterisation (5), which was required to satisfy the needs of\u000a      the project.\u000a    In order to fit the requirements for endodontistry, the core material\u000a      needed to be flexible enough to fit random shapes of root canals but stiff\u000a      enough to insert. It also needed to be compatible with DRFP's hydrophilic\u000a      polymer, enabling it adhere to the core and to swell only in the radial\u000a      direction. Two further challenging requirements were that the core had to\u000a      be radio-opaque (visible on x-rays) and compatible with a\u000a      mass-manufacturing technique such as micro-injection moulding. These two\u000a      requirements were particularly challenging, as a highly filled,\u000a      radio-opaque, material is very difficult to mould in the high aspect\u000a      ratios required for this application.\u000a    A multi-component polymer matrix and micro-powder filler material needed\u000a      to be accurately blended to provide good consistency and the correct\u000a      degree of radiopacity. Key parameters included polymer ratios and filler\u000a      particle size. Materials were assessed based on their flow behaviour,\u000a      mechanical properties and radiopacity (assessed using x-ray). The use of\u000a      such heavily filled (60% ZrO2 by weight) hygroscopic materials\u000a      then required careful material preparation and handling prior to, and\u000a      during, the micromoulding process as a moisture content outside a very\u000a      small range would result in brittle, or incomplete components.\u000a    Rheological assessment of the candidate materials was the key to moulding\u000a      success and previous pioneering research work (6) investigating flow\u000a      behaviour at very high shear rates (characteristic of this type of\u000a      geometry) allowed the materials to be tested in environments which were\u000a      outside the scope of standard testing methods. In addition, these tests\u000a      showed significant differences between the anticipated and actual flow\u000a      behaviour, which were used to modify the production process in order to\u000a      achieve a high quality product.\u000a    To achieve the required feature sizes and tolerances, specialized\u000a      manufacturing techniques were needed to produce the cavity forms for the\u000a      micromoulding process. Microsystems UK (www.microsystems.uk.com) were\u000a      selected from the extensive network of companies known to Polymer MNT as\u000a      the provider of the mould cavities. Off-line surface characterisation\u000a      techniques were used to verify cavity forms prior to the moulding process.\u000a    The product form required the accurate high-pressure and high-speed\u000a      injection rates offered by one of the Microsystem 50 micromoulding\u000a      machines available at the Centre which was specifically designed for\u000a      moulding abrasive materials such as the ZrO2 composite used in\u000a      this research. State-of-the-art data acquisition techniques combined with\u000a      the expertise of the staff within the Centre developed during previous\u000a      research activities ensured that the optimised process window could be\u000a      identified and the high aspect ratio cavity was completely filled in a\u000a      repeatable manner, a feat which previously had been impossible during\u000a      trials at leading commercial injection moulders.\u000a    Once the products had been verified in use over a range of clinical\u000a      trials, the University worked to develop a production process capable of\u000a      meeting the required demand for products which involved the design and\u000a      manufacture of a completely new tooling solution capable of making parts\u000a      in a fully automated system within an ISO Class 7 clean room environment.\u000a      With the new system, production rates are typically 3000 components per\u000a      6-hour shift.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43520","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Modern automotive brakes have to provide consistently high performance\u000a      over a wide range of\u000a      operating conditions including high temperatures and high speeds.

Concerns relating to brake noise and vibration within JLR have\u000a      decreased as a result of\u000a      better understanding of brake noise among braking systems design engineers\u000a      which has resulted\u000a      in a saving of 471 days, and 3800 hours amongst the Brakes Engineering\u000a      Department staff (a). For\u000a      example, JLR took the decision to lower their in-house standard friction\u000a      level to 0.38, reducing\u000a      noise propensity because of the reduced leading contact offset (2).\u000a      Associated with other design\u000a      improvements, the result has been that since 2009 the number of identified\u000a      concerns relating to\u000a      brake noise and vibration has halved, warranty costs have been\u000a      substantially reduced, and\u000a      customer satisfaction has increased (a).\u000a    The advanced techniques of holographic interferometry developed by the\u000a      team have revealed\u000a      details of noisy brake systems that were previously unknown (3). Our\u000a      results have been\u000a      disseminated internationally and have been used to validate predictive\u000a      Finite Element (FE)\u000a      analysis procedures for brake design which have been adopted and used by\u000a      many brake and\u000a      vehicle manufacturers for noise prediction (a,b,c,d,e). Our predictive\u000a      tool for brake NVH is currently\u000a      being used by four vehicle and brake system manufacturers to support\u000a      understanding of how brake\u000a      noise is generated and to propose design improvements to avoid it.\u000a      Currently two UK car\u000a      manufacturers are using noise counter measures that were originally\u000a      proposed by the Bradford\u000a      team (Bentley and JLR). Prior to successful application of the\u000a      countermeasure, new Bentley\u000a      vehicles were unable to be released for production because of brake noise\u000a      (b).\u000a    We have worked closely with Bentley (5,6,b) over many years to advance\u000a      their understanding of\u000a      brake judder. This has resulted in their adopting stress relieving of\u000a      brake discs to ensure that\u000a      warranty claims arising from judder are minimised. The research is also\u000a      being used to direct\u000a      Bentley's future disc design and selection.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at the University of Bradford has enabled many major vehicle and\u000a      brake manufacturers\u000a      to improve the design of their brakes and braking systems to increase\u000a      customer satisfaction and\u000a      sales, and reduce costs.

The Bradford group's research has\u000a      generated\u000a      advanced and unique knowledge and expertise in many aspects of brake\u000a      performance and vehicle\u000a      behaviour during braking. The understanding of contact and pressure\u000a      distributions between the\u000a      rotor and stator components of a brake has led to fundamental changes in\u000a      brake design including\u000a      more compliant friction materials for disc brake pads which provide more\u000a      uniform pressure\u000a      distributions, and has highlighted the importance of improved distribution\u000a      of actuation force applied\u000a      to the pad back plate. The use of Finite Element methods for\u000a      thermo-mechanical and modal\u000a      analyses has been correlated with experimental data, and has demonstrated\u000a      how predictive\u000a      techniques can be used to avoid operational problems at the design stage.\u000a      We have recently\u000a      published the first fully comprehensive non-linear simulation of brake\u000a      noise generation using multi-body dynamics software from current research with JLR (2). Much of this\u000a      research has been\u000a      actively promulgated through the annual `Braking of Road Vehicles' short\u000a      course for industry.\u000a    Warranty claims from brake noise and judder have become a major problem\u000a      for all road vehicle\u000a      manufacturers and research expertise in this area has recently been\u000a      strengthened in the Bradford\u000a      group. Companies including JLR, Bentley, Ford, Hyundai, TMD, BPW, BMW,\u000a      Meritor, Volvo,\u000a      Bosch, Toyota, and Mando have sponsored brake noise research since 1993.\u000a      Examples include\u000a      two CASE awards and continuing research collaboration with Bentley (5,6)\u000a      which has led to an\u000a      advanced understanding of brake judder and the effects of thermo-elastic\u000a      and thermo-plastic\u000a      behaviour. It has generated a revised approach to brake disc design that\u000a      includes aerodynamic\u000a      design of the disc vents to give overall even heating and cooling of the\u000a      disc and has demonstrated\u000a      elastic distortion during heavy braking for the first time. In addition it\u000a      has led to the suggestion of\u000a      disc stress relieving to avoid in-service stress relieving and subsequent\u000a      disc distortion. Advanced\u000a      whole body visual techniques (holographic interferometry) have been\u000a      developed to analyse the\u000a      vibration characteristics of brake systems, forming the basis of a\u000a      predictive tool (3). These enable\u000a      both in-plane and out-of-plane absolute displacements to be investigated.\u000a      The techniques were\u000a      extended to record time-related images of disc modes while braking, and\u000a      showed that the disc\u000a      continues to vibrate under the pad and is not suppressed by it. We\u000a      explained why certain\u000a      frequencies were more likely to occur by investigating the disc\/pad\u000a      interface geometry and have\u000a      provided a predictive tool for industry. We measured the dynamic interface\u000a      pressure of the pad and\u000a      showed that the general centre of pressure varied during braking.\u000a      Correlated over car and\u000a      commercial vehicle brake systems, we showed that a 15-20mm leading contact\u000a      offset would\u000a      increase disc brake noise propensity and predicted this to be possible\u000a      with normal 03bc values and\u000a      existing brake designs (3).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43942","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Electronic Stability Control (ESC) systems have been in use since around\u000d\u000a      2000 and have widely publicised benefits to the user. Since 2005 their\u000d\u000a      impact has been measurable and Garrot [5.1] notes that single\u000d\u000a      vehicle accidents have been reduced by 30-40%, whilst for `loss of\u000d\u000a      control' fatal accidents the reduction is up to 67%. With such obvious\u000d\u000a      benefits to consumers, many manufacturers are fitting ESC systems as\u000d\u000a      standard. EU legislation has required all HGVs and coaches to be fitted\u000d\u000a      with ESC since 2010 and all cars must have ESC by 2014. Critically, most\u000d\u000a      ESC systems use the Antilock Brake System (ABS) brake actuators already\u000d\u000a      fitted to vehicles. These act discretely, at or near the point of loss of\u000d\u000a      control of the vehicle, braking the vehicle as well as correcting its yaw\u000d\u000a      rate but producing a noticeable intervention to the driver. Whilst the\u000d\u000a      statistics prove the accident prevention benefits of these systems, the\u000d\u000a      motoring press dislike the intervention and in most cases the system can\u000d\u000a      be turned off by the driver.\u000d\u000a    The advantage of ALSD is that yaw rate control is provided continuously,\u000d\u000a      and imperceptibly, to the driver. The yaw correction is provided by\u000d\u000a      left\/right drive torque redistribution at the rear wheels, so no braking\u000d\u000a      is applied in most driving scenarios. The torque transfer capacity is\u000d\u000a      limited and the Jaguar system is implemented in conjunction with a\u000d\u000a      brake-based system that intervenes in the most extreme scenarios. For\u000d\u000a      drivers of the very powerful supercharged cars that adopt this system,\u000d\u000a      however, maintaining continuous control over the wider range of yaw\u000d\u000a      behaviour of the car is seen as a significant advantage, making the\u000d\u000a      potentially fatal consequences of the driver turning off the ESC less\u000d\u000a      likely.\u000d\u000a    Following the vehicle and simulation based research carried out by\u000d\u000a      Matthew Hancock within his PhD research, the system was adopted on\u000d\u000a      Jaguar's X250 programme for the 2009 XFR (the supercharged variant of the\u000d\u000a      XF) [5.2]. The control software passed through company\u000d\u000a      homologation, quality and reliability processes to satisfy BS EN\u000d\u000a      ISO9001:2008 and therefore attracted rigorous scrutiny and some\u000d\u000a      modification for mass production.\u000d\u000a    ALSD does not operate independently of other software on the vehicle. For\u000d\u000a      example, vehicle speed and yaw rate sensing software and road friction\u000d\u000a      estimation are required for its use; these were not developed as part of\u000d\u000a      this research. However, the vehicle and differential system modelling,\u000d\u000a      supporting simulation work and subsequent structural design of the\u000d\u000a      controller is specifically relevant. The fundamental operation of Jaguar's\u000d\u000a      control software is substantially that which appears in Hancock's PhD. The\u000d\u000a      research is now in production and contributes very substantially to the\u000d\u000a      overall success of the ALSD on the production vehicle, providing \"a major\u000d\u000a      contribution to the handling performance and stability control refinement\u000d\u000a      of these vehicles\" [5.2].\u000d\u000a    Since the XFR was launched to critical acclaim (What Car voted the\u000d\u000a      XF car of the year in 2008, and best executive car in 2011), Jaguar has\u000d\u000a      introduced the ALSD system onto all new supercharged variants of its range\u000d\u000a      (XF, XK and XJ). To date approximately 20,000 of these vehicles have been\u000d\u000a      sold worldwide.\u000d\u000a    Jaguar is not the only car company offering differential control (BMW\u000d\u000a      offer a similar system on the M5) and, as stated, not all of the ESC\u000d\u000a      benefits of Jaguar's supercharged cars pertain to the ALSD system.\u000d\u000a      However, the system does introduce benefits for drivers that users have\u000d\u000a      praised. Press reviews note the beneficial handling qualities as well as\u000d\u000a      stability of the ALSD.

The key research here\u000d\u000a      considered theoretical capabilities and control authority from relatively\u000d\u000a      expensive, overdriven differentials and also cheaper active limited slip\u000d\u000a      differentials (ALSD). Although it has a more limited torque transfer\u000d\u000a      capacity, the ALSD is capable of stabilising the vehicle's handling\u000d\u000a      response and is the system now in use on Jaguar vehicles.\u000d\u000a    The research started within an MEng individual student project undertaken\u000d\u000a      by Matthew Hancock (Loughborough undergraduate 1997 to 2002), sponsored by\u000d\u000a      Jaguar Cars Ltd and under the supervision of Timothy Gordon, then\u000d\u000a      Loughborough Professor of Vehicle Dynamics and Control (1985-2002).\u000d\u000a      Matthew Hancock joined Jaguar Cars' research division after graduation and\u000d\u000a      pursued the research via a part-time PhD with Loughborough, funded by\u000d\u000a      Jaguar, under the supervision of Loughborough lecturer Matt Best (employed\u000d\u000a      1996 to date) and industrial supervisor Robert Williams (JLR). The\u000d\u000a      resulting 2006 PhD thesis [3.1] includes most of the substantive\u000d\u000a      elements of research on which the production systems are based. Although\u000d\u000a      the protection of confidential and commercially sensitive material\u000d\u000a      restricted publication, the fundamental research has been presented in\u000d\u000a      respected engineering journals [3.2] and [3.3].\u000d\u000a    The research required vehicle and differential modelling and validation,\u000d\u000a      and the development of practicable control algorithms using model\u000d\u000a      reference and classical control techniques, to regulate continuously the\u000d\u000a      handling (understeer) behaviour and also maintain vehicle stability and\u000d\u000a      hence safety. The measure of stability that can be recorded most easily on\u000d\u000a      the vehicle is the rotation (yaw) rate through the corner. Thus in\u000d\u000a      developing the techniques for test vehicles, the fundamental research was\u000d\u000a      modified to use yaw rate alone to determine the control action, with its\u000d\u000a      magnitude adapted according to vehicle forward speed and road surface\u000d\u000a      friction. The vehicle development work also included integration and\u000d\u000a      conflict resolution of the ALSD with a conventional brake-based yaw\u000d\u000a      stabilisation system that is also invoked in the most extreme cases of\u000d\u000a      loss of control.

The two main applications are for ballistic and\u000d\u000a      robotics\/force transmission [5.3]. For the production of ballistic\u000d\u000a      articles, the tapes offer a significant advantage over yarns in terms of\u000d\u000a      weight and the amount of chemicals needed. Moreover, plates made from\u000d\u000a      Endumax&#174; retain the original form and performance levels, even\u000d\u000a      when exposed to high temperatures and moisture [5.4].

By tailoring the molecular characteristics it is possible to\u000d\u000a      change their physical and mechanical properties, e.g. by varying the chain\u000d\u000a      length of a simple linear polyethylene it is possible to make use of the\u000d\u000a      same class of polymer as either a commodity or an engineering plastic. The\u000d\u000a      latter is used for highly demanding applications such as security (body\u000d\u000a      armour or vehicle protection due to its light weight and high tensile\u000d\u000a      breaking strength); healthcare (prostheses due to its biocompatibility);\u000d\u000a      energy (in the form of biaxial drawn films and composites) and water\u000d\u000a      filtration (membranes by changing the functionalities).\u000d\u000a    Although desirable physical properties such as abrasion resistance and\u000d\u000a      high impact strength increase with increasing molar mass, the processing\u000d\u000a      of these materials via conventional routes becomes very challenging due to\u000d\u000a      the material's very high melt viscosity. Attempts have been made to\u000d\u000a      process this material at the border between the solid and melt states, but\u000d\u000a      the results have been poor. To circumvent the difficulties in the\u000d\u000a      processability of Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWP) for the\u000d\u000a      production of high modulus and high strength fibres, a solution based\u000d\u000a      spinning route is commonly adopted. In this process, 5 wt% of the polymer\u000d\u000a      is dissolved in 95 wt% of a suitable solvent in order to reduce the\u000d\u000a      entanglements between very long molecular chains that are responsible for\u000d\u000a      the very high melt viscosity [3.1-3.5]. This solution-processing\u000d\u000a      route demands solvent recovery, thus making the whole process\u000d\u000a      economically, technologically and environmentally unattractive. The\u000d\u000a      process developed in Loughborough University does not involve any solvent\u000d\u000a      and the properties of several products are unprecedented [3.5].\u000d\u000a    Research at Loughborough University by Rastogi and his team since January\u000d\u000a      2007 has adopted a strategic chain of knowledge approach, where the\u000d\u000a      combination of chemistry, physics, rheology and processing led to the\u000d\u000a      development of disentangled polyethylene directly from the synthesis [3.5,\u000a        3.6].\u000d\u000a    The new synthetic route allows a product to be obtained that shows better\u000d\u000a      mechanical properties compared to commercially available rivals, with the\u000d\u000a      additional advantage that it can be processed without making use of\u000d\u000a      solvent(s), yielding fibres with unprecedentedly high values of modulus\u000d\u000a      and strength [3.5]. The ease in sintering and the exceptional\u000d\u000a      mechanical and wear properties shown by the polymer can be applied in a\u000d\u000a      variety of applications, such as the development of lighter bullet- proof\u000d\u000a      vests, improved knee and hip prostheses, and thin films for batteries.\u000d\u000a    Combined with the technological developments, the synthesised polymers\u000d\u000a      have opened new questions in polymer science, thus giving Loughborough a\u000d\u000a      leading position. For example, when melting the `disentangled' crystals a\u000d\u000a      metastable melt state is obtained, which slowly evolves to the\u000d\u000a      thermodynamically stable state [3.1, 3.2, 3.4]. The research has\u000d\u000a      found that the transient state of the metastable melt shows a strong time\u000d\u000a      dependence on molecular weight and distribution. Rheological aspects of\u000d\u000a      the metastable melt state in the linear and the nonlinear viscoelastic\u000d\u000a      region remain unexplored and existing theories based on the\u000d\u000a      thermodynamically stable melt state cannot be applied. Our research is\u000d\u000a      currently addressing these new and challenging aspects of polymer science\u000d\u000a      [3.1-3.4].\u000d\u000a    Key researchers involved in this activity at Loughborough University are\u000d\u000a      Sanjay Rastogi (Professor, Polymer Technology Sep 2006 to present), Sara\u000d\u000a      Ronca (Lecturer, Polymer Chemistry Oct 2008 to present), Giuseppe Forte\u000d\u000a      (Technician, Ethylene Polymerisation Lab Oct 2008 to present), Anurag\u000d\u000a      Pandey (PhD student 2008-2012), A.

This is now being put to use\u000a      internationally to develop therapeutics [5.1]. As of July 2013, 47\u000a      of these systems worth &#163;20.1M have been sold in laboratory and GMP\u000a      configurations and are being used to benefit current and future patients\u000a      by both enabling translational research and manufacturing therapeutics.\u000a      TAP are in discussions with potential purchasers of 50 further systems\u000a      with half of these to be applied to either cell therapy development or\u000a      stem cell research. As a result of the orders, TAP Biosystems and their\u000a      build partners have created 15-20 new jobs [5.2].\u000a    The Loughborough research uniquely allows the transfer of manual stem\u000a      cell culture processes to automation and pioneered process design\u000a      techniques for their subsequent optimisation. The research was\u000a      collaborative with the science base, manufacturing industry and its\u000a      suppliers and end users and designed with embedded direct dissemination\u000a      routes.\u000a    After some initial work, human (h) dermal fibroblasts were cultured on\u000a      the automated CompacT SelecT in collaboration with Intercytex (2006-2009),\u000a      human smooth muscle cells with Cook Myocyte (US) (2008-2009), hMSC with\u000a      Oreffo of Southampton (2006, [3.1]), foetally derived neural\u000a      progenitors with Reneuron (2008-2009, [3.3]), hESC (differentiated\u000a      to cardiomyocytes) with Denning and Young of Nottingham (2008-2009, [3.2])\u000a      and latterly human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) with Vallier and\u000a      Pederson of Cambridge (2011-2013) and GMP grade hESC cells with WiCell\u000a      (US) (2012-2013). Consequently the work has significantly contributed to\u000a      the development of cell-based therapeutics for blood replacement, stroke\u000a      and degenerative diseases of the brain, leukaemia and other cancers and\u000a      tissue repair including for the bladder [5.1].\u000a    The product launched by TAP Biosystems has a global reach: 40% of the\u000a      systems sold are in Europe and 60% in the US with concentrations on the\u000a      East (MA) and West Coasts (CA) [5.2], and new markets are emerging\u000a      in Russia, China and Korea. Loughborough further enabled the exploitation\u000a      process by demonstrating the capability of the machine to culture complex\u000a      cell types of significance to customers and to operate to GMP.\u000a    Understanding how to manufacture stem cell based products is one of the\u000a      key critical translational steps required to allow such therapies to reach\u000a      the market and for successful business investment and sector growth. The\u000a      new manufacturing science researched at Loughborough has allowed the\u000a      reduction to practice of complex research laboratory based biological\u000a      processes.\u000a    This capability has significantly influenced the development of the new\u000a      Cell Therapies Catapult. The Group was joint leader of one of the three\u000a      bids, reaching the final round of the subsequently withdrawn academic\u000a      competition for leadership of the Catapult during 2011. The Catapult was\u000a      then created in a top-down process by the Technology Strategy Board with a\u000a      CEO being appointed in April of 2012 and a Chairman in September 2012. An\u000a      MOU establishing a strategic collaboration between the Cell Therapies\u000a      Catapult and the manufacturing, automation and process capability at\u000a      Loughborough University was signed on 21st January 2013 [5.6].\u000a    Further, Williams chaired the meeting (09\/07\/08) that led to the founding\u000a      of the Regenerative Medicine RGM\/1 committee of BSI. Whilst creating the\u000a      first two Publically Available Specifications, PAS, (PAS 83 and 84) was\u000a      straightforward being solely descriptive of the status quo, a third, PAS\u000a      93 on Cell Characterisation [5.7], was more problematic, requiring\u000a      a Loughborough intervention [5.8] to meet the needs of the\u000a      innovative businesses. It is important to recognise that this third PAS [5.7]\u000a      is the first of its kind in the world and is likely to lead to an ISO\u000a      standard.\u000a    Our track record was also key to securing essential follow-on research\u000a      funding, in particular the leadership of major national consortia\u000a      including The EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Regenerative\u000a      Medicine (2010) [G3.7], its uplift to act as a national centre\u000a      (2012) [G3.11], the translational research fellowship programme,\u000a      the EPSRC ETERM Cross Disciplinary Landscape Award (2010) [G3.6],\u000a      the EPSRC Early Career Fellowship of Dr Robert Thomas (2013) and other\u000a      subsequent grants [G3.2-5,G3.8-10,G3.13-15].\u000a    The work has also generated a large number of skilled individuals with\u000a      contributing research assistants and PhD graduates from the group being\u000a      employed as lecturers and senior lecturers (Thomas and Liu, Loughborough)\u000a      in academia and as technical and commercial professionals in international\u000a      translational and technology transfer organisations (Rayment, Griffith\u000a      University, Australia; Ginty, Cell Therapy Catapult) and businesses (Kee,\u000a      Organogenesis, US; Singh, Stem Cell Technologies, Canada) with a\u000a      consequent impact on technology translation.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 2003 Loughborough University has worked with industry to create\u000a      future manufacturing systems to enable large scale production of human\u000a      stem cells.

These cells are key to regenerative therapies\u000a      that replace or regenerate human cells, tissues and organs. It is\u000a      predicted these developments will transform healthcare and the creation of\u000a      a new industry sector is envisaged, as is evidenced by the creation of the\u000a      Cell Therapy Catapult. The research arose from the industrial experience\u000a      of Professor David Williams in terms of addressing scale-up challenges\u000a      towards the end of pharmaceutical product life cycles. Returning to\u000a      academia in 2003 as an EPSRC funded Research Chair at Loughborough he\u000a      committed to address the automation, process design and scale-up\u000a      challenges for emerging industries, in particular those commercialising\u000a      regenerative medicines.\u000a    Williams headed the EPSRC Grand Challenge in Regenerative Medicine - remedi\u000a      [Grant Ref EP\/C534247\/1][G3.1], which began in 2005. The most\u000a      significant work package of remedi addressed systems for the\u000a      automation of therapeutic human stem cell culture. It was a collaboration\u000a      of Loughborough's manufacturing, quality, process, process design and\u000a      biological engineering skills. The Automation Partnership (now TAP\u000a      Biosystems) providing machine design skills, and multiple user partners\u000a      who provided key understanding of the requirements for the manufactured\u000a      product. Following the specification of a machine by the collaborating\u000a      partners it was constructed and installed at Loughborough University in\u000a      2006.\u000a    With user collaborators, the consistent automated adherent culture of\u000a      human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) [3.1], human embryonic stem\u000a      cells (hESC) [3.2], human foetal progenitor cells [3.3],\u000a      cord blood derived stem cells and smooth muscle cells was demonstrated at\u000a      the level of quality required by clinical and commercial therapeutic use.\u000a      Also, quality engineering and process design techniques were applied for\u000a      the first time to improve the quality of stem cell bio-processing,\u000a      including the measurement and comparison of manual and automated culture\u000a      Process Capability (Cpk) [3.4], methods of product\u000a      characterisation [3.5] and use of Design of Experiments including\u000a      Taguchi Screening Experiments and Response Surface Methods to improve\u000a      process consistency and product quality and reduce the Cost of Goods as\u000a      summarised in [3.6].\u000a    The work has been executed within a quality system for translational\u000a      research allowing transfer to an industrial environment requiring the use\u000a      of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), essential for therapeutics.\u000a    Since the initial transformative research in remedi (2005-2010) [G3.1],\u000a      research has continued with EPSRC [G3.5-7, G3.11-13], BBSRC BRIC [G3.2],\u000a      TSB [G3.8], MRC UKRMP [G3.14-15], Darpa [G3.4] as\u000a      well as other funding [G3.3, G3.9, G3.10].

It was the main focus of collaboration with the global tool\u000a      manufacturer JCB that culminated in a mutual project on a breaker in 2001,\u000a      with LU developing both the theoretical backgrounds and principal design\u000a      ideas that were implemented in a specific design at JCB.\u000a    As a result, in 2008 JCB launched its new, safer yet more powerful\u000a      commercial breaker HMLV25, which it continues to sell in its markets\u000a      around the world. More than 1,800 units had been sold by 2013 with export\u000a      markets including Australia, Azerbaijan, North America, Oman and Russia [5.1].\u000a      Operators can use it for longer without incurring the risks of\u000a      irreversible and significant harm to their health. The design solution was\u000a      patented worldwide by JCB in 2008 under the names of its inventors from\u000a      Loughborough University, viz. Prof Babitsky and Dr Sokolov and JCB, Mr\u000a      Malkin [5.2].\u000a    In 2008 JCB stated that \"the unique system dispenses with the traditional\u000a      design\" and that \"vibration levels on competing machines start at more\u000a      than double\" the level for HM25LV. As a result, \"operators can now safely\u000a      use the machine for a full eight-hour working day without risk of\u000a      exceeding recommended Hand Arm Vibration levels\". It added that \"the\u000a      HM25LV marks the start of a new generation of handheld breaker design.\" [5.3]\u000a    When purchasing the product in 2009, one of the end-users, Tarmac\u000a      National Contracting, stated: \"Within Tarmac, the health of our staff is\u000a      of paramount importance particularly with regard to HAVS... the vibration\u000a      level of the breakers was the main driver in our decision-making process.\u000a      Tests were carried out on the HM25LV, confirming JCB's claims that they\u000a      are the lowest available.\" [5.4]\u000a    For an understanding of the scale of the problem addressed by the JCB\u000a      breaker and its underpinning research, the Health and Safety Executive\u000a      estimates two million people in the UK alone are at risk of HAVS. The\u000a      estimated annual cost of HAVS to the British economy is about &#163;447M [5.5].\u000a      There is no effective treatment available for the vascular symptoms and\u000a      neurological component of HAVS. The best way to deal with HAVS is to\u000a      prevent it, by reducing the levels of vibration operators are exposed to.\u000a    Before the 2000s global research into the mechanics of vibro-impact\u000a      systems, elucidating beneficial and detrimental effects of multiple\u000a      impacting, was undertaken by separate research groups in a few countries.\u000a      Loughborough University decided to increase awareness of, and foster\u000a      collaboration between, researchers in this field and end-users. In 2004 it\u000a      established the International Centre of Vibro-Impact Systems (ICoVIS),\u000a      supported by the EPSRC. The Centre unites more than 25 main research\u000a      groups from more than 20 countries working in this area. Its international\u000a      events serve to disseminate research to academic and industrial audiences.\u000a      To date, these events have been held in the UK, USA, Japan, China, Italy,\u000a      Morocco and Germany (see e.g. [5.6, 5.7]). A series of special\u000a      issues of major journals have been published, as have several books.\u000a      ICoVIS has become a first contact point for industry on various aspects of\u000a      VIS; among its members are also industrial companies, in particular, JCB.\u000a      These activities allowed the establishment of the new scientific sub-area\u000a      &#8212; mechanics of vibro-impact systems. This increased awareness of academic\u000a      and industrial researchers about new ideas, methods and tools that can be\u000a      used for design of new structures and processes increasing productivity,\u000a      improving an environmental footprint and preventing catastrophic\u000a      engineering failures.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 1995, Loughborough's research into vibro-impact systems (VIS) has\u000a      made handheld breaker tools safer for operators and has also increased\u000a      machining efficiency. Users have been prone to detrimental `hand arm\u000a      vibration' effects of multiple impacts, including the debilitating\u000a      condition `white finger'.

However, such repetitive impacts are strongly non-linear\u000a      dynamic processes and can have severe and damaging effects on operators.\u000a      At Loughborough University (LU) Professor Vladimir Babitsky (1995-2011 and\u000a      2013-present) has been developing the foundations of the mechanics of\u000a      vibro-impact systems since 1995, using ideas of non-linear dynamics.\u000a      Through this research, Professor Babitsky formulated and solved a general\u000a      dynamic problem for the optimal dynamic cycle of hand-held percussion\u000a      machines [3.1-3.3]. Notwithstanding strict requirements for\u000a      operational parameters of hand-held machines, hundreds of thousands of\u000a      their operators are injured, with diseases ranging from so called `white\u000a      finger' to paralysis.\u000a    The rigorous mathematical solution of the problem of optimal dynamic\u000a      cycle of hand-held percussion machines was based on Prof. Babitsky's\u000a      methods of structural synthesis of the strongly nonlinear VIS. Computer\u000a      simulations and experimental studies proved the effectiveness of\u000a      theoretical predictions [3.1, 3.4-3.6] and led to the discovery of\u000a      the existence of the dynamic cycle of excitation of the hand-held\u000a      percussion machines with vibration-free handles [3.1], which\u000a      enabled the development of the new type of heavy hydraulic breaker with\u000a      low emission of hazardous vibration. The breaker's general dynamic model\u000a      was developed as a multi-body VIS, for which a stable and robust solution\u000a      was found and validated [3.1, 3.6]. The engineering synthesis of\u000a      the suggested optimal structure requested development of a special\u000a      mechanism with zero differential stiffness. A hydro-pneumatic unit with\u000a      zero stiffness was developed and tested successfully on a modified\u000a      commercially available heavy-duty hand-held hydraulic breaker produced by\u000a      JCB. More than a twofold increase in vibration suppression in the\u000a      developed experimental model was registered compared to the original\u000a      breaker with spring-suspended handles. The research and development were\u000a      conducted at LU's Wolfson School Vibration Laboratory, mostly by Dr Ilya\u000a      Sokolov (1999-2007) under the supervision of Profs Babitsky and Neil\u000a      Halliwell (1990-2011), as well as RAs and PhDs of Prof. Babitsky's group,\u000a      see list at end of section.\u000a    LU personnel engaged in this research: V Babitsky (Professor 1995-2011\u000a      and 2013-present); N Halliwell (Professor 1990-2011), I Sokolov (Research\u000a      Associate 1997-2005), A Veprik (Senior Lecturer 1995-2005), E Golysheva\u000a      (Research Student 2000 - 2004)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43990","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    We now present evidence for research cited in s2 and s3 to show impact in\u000a      the development of new software and hardware technologies that have\u000a      delivered commercial and economic benefits, with examples cited for two\u000a      companies. The first demonstrates very specific impact within the original\u000a      industrial sector; the second shows that the impact has extended beyond\u000a      the original domain.\u000a    Example 1\u000a    The understanding of process simulation for reflow soldering was utilized\u000a      within a research contract with Datapaq Ltd, leading to a new product\u000a      offering that has seen significant success [5.1]. Datapaq's Rapid\u000a      Oven Setup (ROS) currently enjoys sales of around 700 units per annum, of\u000a      which 90% are exported. Datapaq is the market leader in Europe, with\u000a      substantial market shares in China, the USA and SE Asia [5.2].\u000a    Datapaq is a process data logging company, selling hardware with\u000a      associated software to visualise and analyse acquired data. This project\u000a      extended their offering with a software tool (ROS) that provides a\u000a      predictive capability for a given process and a methodology utilising a\u000a      characterisation artefact (Heat Transfer Sensor (HTS)) that enables\u000a      automatic process model creation. Loughborough developed the algorithms,\u000a      simulation techniques and methodologies for automated model creation and\u000a      calibration, along with designing the prototype HTS [3.1, 3.4 &amp;\u000a        3.5].\u000a    The reflow soldering of printed circuit boards (PCBs) is a key step in\u000a      the manufacturing of electronics. PCBs vary in cost from a few pence to\u000a      tens of thousands of pounds, with the more expensive boards playing\u000a      safety-critical roles in, for example, aviation. Improving control of the\u000a      ovens used for reflow soldering reduces failure rates, benefitting the\u000a      industry, its customers and end-users.\u000a    For each new product or solder paste introduced the reflow settings have\u000a      to be optimised. This is traditionally a time consuming process, but ROS\u000a      automates it quickly, easily and accurately by calculating the optimum\u000a      settings for any combination of oven, product and target profile. ROS also\u000a      reads CAD files, automatically producing detailed PCB thermal models. By\u000a      using Datapaq's HTS to measure the specific oven performance, the ROS tool\u000a      can ensure the optimum profile is found, thereby reducing scrap and saving\u000a      time and money. It works on all reflow ovens.\u000a    The understanding of reflow soldering derived from the research [3.1\u000a        &amp; 3.2] enabled the derivation of control strategies to ensure\u000a      PCBs fell within specific process metrics by adjusting zone temperatures,\u000a      airflow rates and conveyor speed [3.4 &amp; 3.5].\u000a    The understanding derived from the original project in the process\u000a      control and optimisation strand [3.1] was capitalised on allowing\u000a      Datapaq to deliver novel products to the electronics- manufacturing\u000a      sector. They state: \"The technical advantage that we gained from\u000a        working in partnership with Loughborough University has enabled us to\u000a        maintain our market leadership position in Europe particularly in\u000a        Germany and France. In these developed markets the end users need the\u000a        benefit afforded by working with a solution that maximizes production\u000a        efficiency to be able to compete with competitors from lower wage cost\u000a        economies.\" [5.2] The impact from our research in developing\u000a      the ROS product has clearly generated both commercial benefits for the\u000a      company concerned and has been economically beneficial in terms of\u000a      contributing to its market position.\u000a    Example 2\u000a    Specifications and involvement with our research partner Maya Heat\u000a      Transfer Technologies [5.3], led to new solver capabilities, based\u000a      on research in s3 [3.1 &amp; 3.2]. These capabilities are:\u000a    (a) automated FE model building direct from electronics CAD. Maya state:\u000a      \"This demonstrated the feasibility and time savings associated with\u000a        this approach. Maya then worked with its business partner (now Siemens\u000a        PLM) to incorporate this technology into the finite element pre-\u000a        processing environment as a new FE model creation method. The technology\u000a        was successfully developed and delivered to customers worldwide. It has\u000a        found application in other areas of thermal analysis including\u000a        spacecraft and automobiles. In the latest generation of software (NX\u000a        CAE) the technology has been extended to provide direct creation of an\u000a        FE mesh from the PCB definition. This has removed the need to create a\u000a        mesh for the PCB and for each component type.\" [5.3]\u000a    (b) a technique to define physical movement during a thermal simulation,\u000a      for which Maya state: \"modeling of motion, was added to the thermal\u000a        solver with enhancements to the UI to allow definition of the motion.\u000a        Again, the technology has been delivered to customers worldwide and has\u000a        been used in other industries. As well as modeling PCB's in reflow ovens\u000a        the technology has been used to model other manufacturing processes, sun\u000a        tracking antennas and various spacecraft mechanisms.\" [5.3]\u000a    Maya's business partner has several hundred active licenses for software\u000a      containing these capabilities.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Publically and industrially funded research at Loughborough University into\u000a    the simulation, monitoring and control of electronics soldering has had\u000a    significant impact in the development of new software and hardware\u000a    technologies, which have delivered substantial commercial and economic\u000a    benefits, with examples cited for at least two leading companies.

In 2012 this\u000a      business was worth approximately &#163;2.8M and with current orders is expected\u000a      to double in 2013 [5.1]. In addition a Scandinavian subsidiary,\u000a      Hardstaff AB, located in G&#246;teborg Sweden, was opened in 2010 to provide\u000a      OIGI&#174; systems for Volvo FL and FE trucks. This business was worth\u000a      approximately &#163;1.3M in 2013 [5.1].\u000a    Impact 2: Environmental benefits\u000a      The precise control that is afforded by the OIGI&#174; system means that it can\u000a      be optimised to reduce emissions and adjusted to run on carbon neutral\u000a      biogas and other biofuels [5.1, 5.2]. The &#163;694k\u000a      Hardstaff\/Loughborough University full scale test facility funded by East\u000a      Midlands Development Agency was commissioned in 2009 and allowed the\u000a      environmental impact of dual fuel technology to be assessed particularly\u000a      under transient loads. Relative to a comparable Diesel engine, dual fuel\u000a      offers a 15% reduction in carbon dioxide and at least 30% reduction in\u000a      harmful nitrogen oxides, smoke and particulate emissions [5.1].\u000a      The environmental impact of dual fuel technology is considerable in the\u000a      UK, Europe and beyond and resulted in Hardstaff and Loughborough\u000a      University winning the prestigious Lord Stafford Award in 2010 for\u000a      \"Innovation for Sustainability\" [5.3] and Hardstaff Group being\u000a      runner-up in the industry's Low Carbon Champions Awards hosted by the\u000a      Institute of Mechanical Engineers [5.4].\u000a    Impact 3: Changing approaches in industry\u000a      As a result of the work of Johnson and Clarke and work conducted under the\u000a      TSB\/EPSRC Grant \"High Speed Dual Fuel Direct Injection Engines with\u000a      Advanced EGR and Injection Strategies to Reduce Carbon Dioxide Emissions\"\u000a      a state-of-the-art computer model of the dual fuel combustion process has\u000a      been developed [G3.4]. It has been shown that with multiple Diesel\u000a      injection events, it is possible to increase the substitution rates in\u000a      small, high speed engines. This work paves the way for the exploitation of\u000a      dual fuel systems in passenger cars and small\/medium commercial vehicles.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Loughborough University's (LU) research collaboration with The Hardstaff\u000a      Group has resulted in a commercial Oil-Ignition-Gas-Injection system\u000a      (OIGI&#174;), which substitutes natural gas for Diesel oil in heavy goods\u000a      vehicles. Using optical diagnostics OIGI&#174; was redesigned, increasing\u000a      average substitution rates from 45% to 60%. The economic impact for\u000a      Hardstaff was a fuel saving of &#163;406k per annum. The research allowed\u000a      Hardstaff to create new business with Mercedes-Benz in the UK and Volvo in\u000a      Sweden. OIGI&#174; reduces CO2 by up to 15%, harmful nitrogen oxides\u000a      and particulate emissions by 30%.

Hargrave initiated a series of tests using optical\u000a      diagnostics to investigate key process parameters. Particle image\u000a      velocimetry (PIV), a technique pioneered by the Loughborough Optical\u000a      Engineering Research Group, was used to characterise gas injectors to\u000a      measure flow velocity and laser sheet imaging measured the degree of\u000a      mixing prior to combustion.

[5.7]\u000a    (b) Specific impacts\u000a    Specific impacts made with respect to three NVH aspects mentioned in\u000a      section 2 are:\u000a    1) Clutch in-cycle vibration (whoop):\u000a    Loughborough research identified the root cause of whoop as increased\u000a      flywheel conical whirl with crankshaft flexibility because of the use of\u000a      materials of lower elastic modulus alongside increased combustion power [3.3].\u000a      The impact of the flywheel on the clutch system during pedal actuation\u000a      induced natural mode vibration of the clutch lever assembly. A\u000a      mass-damper, known as the \"Diehl fix\", was traditionally empirically used\u000a      as a method of palliation but this added 1-2 kg to the clutch weight,\u000a      occupied 100-200 cm3 in the engine compartment and had an\u000a      associated cost of $7 per vehicle over an annual production volume of 2\u000a      million vehicles Using the Loughborough methodology, optimisation of the\u000a      clutch cover compliance [3.3] eliminated whoop and the need for\u000a      the Diehl fix, saving $7 per vehicle. The solution was implemented in a\u000a      range of new Ford models including the popular Fiesta and Focus brands\u000a      from 2004 onwards. The modified vehicles used 4-cylinder, 1.8 litre\u000a      diesels with manual transmissions. The implementation work is ongoing for\u000a      other vehicle models. Ford has reported savings, conservatively put, at\u000a      $10 M [5.1].\u000a    (2) Driveline elasto-acoustic response (clonk):\u000a    Impulsive loading of the powertrain occurs with sudden throttle tip-in or\u000a      back-out, or by abrupt release of the clutch pedal. These induce shock\u000a      wave propagation onto hollow thin-walled driveshaft tubes [3.5],\u000a      causing elasto-acoustic response up to an unacceptable 110 dB(A). The most\u000a      cost effective solution, involving spun cardboard fitted liners, has been\u000a      implemented in some light trucks, vans and SUVs including some Transit\u000a      models, Galaxy and Escort vans from 2004 to the present day. Technically,\u000a      there is a noise level reduction of 10-20 dB(A) and improved sound quality\u000a      through reduced high frequency sharp spectral content [3.1].\u000a    (3) Transmission rattle:\u000a    The fundamental research through to technological innovations carried out\u000a      by Ford and Loughborough for palliation of transmission rattle (2006-2010)\u000a      has already resulted in the development of light weight, NVH refined, fuel\u000a      efficient transmissions, including:\u000a    - 5\/6 speed manual transmission (MX65) with a 5 kg reduced mass and 5%\u000a      improved fuel efficiency meeting the research specified metric of\u000a      impulsion ratio not exceeding unity.\u000a    - 7 speed manual transmission (MT90c) with reduced 2 dBA noise level and\u000a      5% fuel efficiency gain.\u000a    - Ford has invested in volume manufacture of these transmissions with an\u000a      investment of &#163;240 M in the UK at Bridgend [5.2].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Reducing vehicle noise and vibration is a key quality objective in the\u000a      automotive industry. Historically, the approach has been costly palliation\u000a      late in the manufacturing process; now a new approach applied earlier in\u000a      the vehicle development cycle has been devised by Loughborough University\u000a      and Ford and implemented at Ford that has led to savings of $7 per vehicle\u000a      with respect to clutch in-cycle vibration (whoop). Ford has reported\u000a      savings of $10M over 5 years, whilst reductions in transmission rattle\u000a      have led to 5% fuel efficiency gains [5.1].

These conflicting requirements lead to higher levels\u000a      of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) [3.1, 3.2]. In the 1990s,\u000a      the industry was unprepared to deal with this in a fundamental, scientific\u000a      and cost effective manner. Ford, the UK's leading volume manufacturer (19%\u000a      of the UK market) had the vision to develop a fundamental and generic\u000a      approach to powertrain refinement, dealing with specific concerns such as\u000a      clutch take-up judder [3.4], in-cycle vibration (whoop) [3.3],\u000a      driveline shuffle and elasto-acoustic response (clonk) [3.5, G3.1]\u000a      and transmission rattle [3.1,3.6]. Under the auspices of the then\u000a      Vice President of Ford Global Development, Richard Parry-Jones, a team of\u000a      Ford specialists, led by Michael Menday and Patrick Kelly, joined a\u000a      programme of research with Homer Rahnejat (at the University of Bradford\u000a      from 1996 and at Loughborough University since 2000) with the objectives\u000a      of developing an overall methodology for refinement and then specifically\u000a      reducing NVH issues. The research spanned 1996-2010, with a methodology\u000a      being developed and applied by Ford since 2008, including palliation of:\u000a      (i)-whoop in Fiesta, Focus and Galaxy (since 2008) and in all Fiesta\u000a      3-cylinder Ecoboost (since 2012), Ecosport models (2013) and planned for\u000a      new Ka model (2015), (ii)-Gear rattle palliation in all low cost diesels;\u000a      Fiesta and 1.6 Ltr. Focus (2010) and 1.5 Ltr. Diesel (2013). Prior to\u000a      2010, the concepts were also used by companies belonging to the Premier\u000a      Automotive Group (PAG), viz. Ford, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercury,\u000a      Aston Martin and Volvo. The PAG was dissolved in 2010.\u000a    The 2-phase approach included: (1) down-cascading from system level\u000a      (vehicle) to rig-based correlation, multi-scale multi-physics modelling\u000a      and definition of performance metrics, and (2) up-cascading from metrics\u000a      to component and system level implementation. This approach yielded many\u000a      beneficial impacts (section 4).\u000a    The multi-scale, multi-physics approach integrated constrained Lagrangian\u000a      dynamics, modal analysis and elasto-acoustic coincidence (using inverse\u000a      boundary element method) with contact mechanics, with elastohydrodynamics\u000a      of concentrated contacts or lightly loaded hydrodynamics [3.1,G3.2-G3.4].\u000a      It dealt with refinement issues, integrated with other vehicle measures.\u000a      The approach was combined with vehicle measurements: acoustic evaluation\u000a      and laser vibrometry [3.1].\u000a    All the NVH research was led by Rahnejat (Loughborough, 2000 - to date)\u000a      and Kelly and Menday (Ford). For whoop there was extended collaboration\u000a      with Prof. Biermann (Aachen) within a research consortium that included\u000a      the companies Raybestos and Fichtel &amp; Sachs. For transmission rattle,\u000a      the research team at Loughborough included Theodossiades (Reader, 2002 - to date), King (Senior Lecturer, 1989 - to date) and Rothberg (Professor,\u000a      1990 - to date) together with the companies AVL, Getrag and GKN. For\u000a      shuffle, clonk, and rattle, the researchers included Mavros (Research\u000a      Associate, 2004-2005, now Senior Lecturer), Kushwaha (Research Fellow,\u000a      2001-2004, now at Magna), Gnanakumarr (PhD student: 2001-2005, Research\u000a      Associate: 2009-2011, now at Ford), Perera (PhD student: 2004-2007,\u000a      Research Associate: 2009-2010, now at Bentley), Tangasawi (PhD student,\u000a      2006-2011, now at AVL), Centea (PhD student, Bradford: 1997-1999, now at\u000a      McMaster) whilst the consortium included Mechanical Dynamics, UK.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44279","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The balls used in elite professional football have been required to\u000d\u000a      satisfy performance standards\u000d\u000a      laid down by the FIFA Quality Concept since 1995. Therefore, in order for\u000d\u000a      football brands and\u000d\u000a      manufacturers to improve the commercial success of their products, they\u000d\u000a      must enhance areas\u000d\u000a      other than performance, since this is constrained. Until 2002, the\u000d\u000a      potential for brands to\u000d\u000a      fundamentally improve the consumer appeal of footballs was inherently\u000d\u000a      limited by the\u000d\u000a      manufacturing process. The research carried out at Loughborough has\u000d\u000a      realised a greater\u000d\u000a      understanding of the relationship between ball design and performance,\u000d\u000a      which has allowed adidas\u000d\u000a      to overcome these restrictions.\u000d\u000a    Given the restrictions on changing ball performance, the research was\u000d\u000a      instead used to identify and\u000d\u000a      inform those aspects of design and construction where modifications could\u000d\u000a      enhance the aesthetic\u000d\u000a      and tactile beauty of the ball for commercial advantage without\u000d\u000a      compromising performance.\u000d\u000a    The impact of the research carried out at Loughborough has been to ensure\u000d\u000a      that the new\u000d\u000a      manufacturing method achieved the following:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Ensured that the inner carcass of the ball provided the appropriate\u000d\u000a        uniform structural rigidity\u000d\u000a        removing the need for outer panels to provide this function.\u000d\u000a      Removed constraints of outer panel shapes such that they could be\u000d\u000a        designed around the\u000d\u000a        desired graphical imagery. This means that patterns are now able to\u000d\u000a        extend across panel\u000d\u000a        edges, where previously the imperfect alignment of conventional flat\u000d\u000a        panel assembly led to\u000d\u000a        misalignment that undermined the quality of appearance.\u000d\u000a      Allowed outer panels to be manufactured from new materials that can be\u000d\u000a        assembled without\u000d\u000a        unevenly straining during inflation, meaning the ball is more spherical\u000d\u000a        and has improved tactile\u000d\u000a        feel.\u000d\u000a      Maintained ball flight performance through the conception and\u000d\u000a        implementation of aero-grooves,\u000d\u000a        where increased outer panels sizes introduced for commercial advantage\u000d\u000a        had potential to\u000d\u000a        detrimentally affect ball aerodynamics\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    These advantages have been realised sequentially by adidas in major\u000d\u000a      tournament footballs. The\u000d\u000a      Teamgeist ball used in the 2006 World Cup was the first to include\u000d\u000a      the new carcass and curved\u000d\u000a      panels whilst satisfying all FIFA Quality standards to the highest\u000d\u000a      certifiable level. It was\u000d\u000a      commercially successful, returning sales of 15 million units compared to 2\u000d\u000a      million sold in 2002\u000d\u000a      [5.1].\u000d\u000a    In 2008, the research reported in Cotton's PhD thesis (2008) led directly\u000d\u000a      to the inclusion of a\u000d\u000a      surface texture on the Europass ball used in the UEFA Euro 2008\u000d\u000a      tournament.\u000d\u000a    For the 2010 Jabulani ball, Loughborough research [3.3,3.4,3.5]\u000d\u000a      led directly to the inclusion of\u000d\u000a      aero-grooves on the surface that were designed to maintain flight\u000d\u000a      stability; they are protected by a\u000d\u000a      patent [3.6] on which Dr Harland is named as co-author. In\u000d\u000a      addition to the tournaments mentioned,\u000d\u000a      derivatives of these balls have also been used for Olympics, Champions\u000d\u000a      League and various\u000d\u000a      national leagues around the world.\u000d\u000a    The success of this approach has led to ball patterns influencing design\u000d\u000a      themes across clothing,\u000d\u000a      stadia and media throughout each tournament. Therefore the consequential\u000d\u000a      impact of this research\u000d\u000a      is likely to be greater than that claimed, but is difficult to\u000d\u000a      substantiate.\u000d\u000a    Sales figures of major tournament footballs are highly sensitive and not\u000d\u000a      made public due to the\u000d\u000a      nature of the sponsorship agreements between brands and tournament\u000d\u000a      organisers, with adidas\u000d\u000a      reported to be paying $351 million to FIFA for the 2010 and 2014 World Cup\u000d\u000a      tournaments alone.\u000d\u000a      As a result sales figures are collated from media reports and press\u000d\u000a      releases but indicate that\u000d\u000a      during the period of Loughborough's research, sales of the adidas match\u000d\u000a      balls and their replicas\u000d\u000a      have increased tenfold &#8212; from two million in 2002 to an estimated 20\u000d\u000a      million in 2010 [5.1,5.2]. The\u000d\u000a      2010 World Cup made a significant contribution to adidas revenues, with\u000d\u000a      the relevant financial\u000d\u000a      quarter in 2010 generating $3.47B, more than $0.58B higher than the $2.89B\u000d\u000a      generated in the\u000d\u000a      equivalent quarter in 2009 [5.3]. These gains have been supported\u000d\u000a      by the raised awareness of\u000d\u000a      engineering innovation achieved via media coverage of the tournament &#8212;\u000d\u000a      more than 2.2 billion\u000d\u000a      people watched more than 20 continuous minutes of TV coverage during the\u000d\u000a      2010 tournament\u000d\u000a      [5.4] &#8212; and specific coverage of the research. Dr Harland completed\u000d\u000a      more than 60 interviews with\u000d\u000a      international broadcasters, including ESPN, BBC and CNN, resulting in\u000d\u000a      coverage totalling more\u000d\u000a      than &#163;1M in AVE (Advertising Value Equivalent). This engagement extended\u000d\u000a      across hard to reach\u000d\u000a      demographics, such as the ~5 million young people who consciously chose to\u000d\u000a      engage with\u000d\u000a      technical films and information on the adidas Facebook site [5.5].\u000d\u000a    In summary, the research cited in this case study has resulted in a step\u000d\u000a      change in the commercial\u000d\u000a      success of a significant product in a global sport leading to huge\u000d\u000a      economic benefits for a\u000d\u000a      multinational company.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Loughborough University academics has influenced the\u000d\u000a      development of elite footballs\u000d\u000a      used in numerous global tournaments including FIFA World Cups, UEFA\u000d\u000a      European\u000d\u000a      Championships and Olympic Games.

The first of these related to\u000d\u000a      the interactions between the\u000d\u000a      outer layers of the ball and the various other surfaces involved in the\u000d\u000a      game.

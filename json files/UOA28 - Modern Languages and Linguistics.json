These interventions are deeply informed by\u000a      her historical perspective, and bear upon questions of political\u000a      legitimacy and the role of constitutions and elections therein. Key focal\u000a      points for this impact have included the Fujimori trial (2008-9) and the\u000a      2011 presidential elections. The impact of Sobrevilla Perea's project to\u000a      digitize provincial newspaper collections in Peru (2009-13) has been to\u000a      ensure wide public access to this historical material, which can also\u000a      inform current political debate.\u000a    Impact activities:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aBlogs on the Fujimori trial. In January 2008, Sobrevilla Perea\u000a        was invited by the human rights organization Coordinadora Nacional de\u000a        Derechos Humanos to act as an observer at the trial of the former\u000a        president of Peru, Alberto Fujimori. She met with victims of the human\u000a        rights abuses perpetrated during his regime, including both the only\u000a        surviving victim of the killing in Barrios Altos and the\u000a        relatives of those `disappeared' at La Cantuta. After the trial,\u000a        Sobrevilla Perea wrote an editorial published in a blog\u000a          in Peru and a\u000a          blog in Argentina, which sparked a debate in Peru and Argentina\u000a        over Fujimori's legacy (since the Barrios Altos case was\u000a        instrumental in bringing to an end amnesty laws in both countries).\u000a      Two articles in Argumentos, the journal of Peru's most\u000a        important think-tank, the Instituto de Estudios Peruanos. In `Las\u000a          elecciones peruanas: reflexiones a base de la historia de la larga\u000a          duraci&#243;n' (April 2011), Sobrevilla Perea offered an historically\u000a        informed perspective on the Peruvian elections. In `&#191;Darle\u000a          una segunda oportunidad al Fujimorismo?' (June 2011), she\u000a        encouraged voters to consider the possibly devastating consequences of\u000a        Keiko Fujimori's election as president.\u000a      \u000aPublic talks and workshops resulting in media engagement.\u000a        Following her participation in the online discussion, Sobrevilla Perea\u000a        was invited to deliver a series of public talks in the UK on the 2011\u000a        Peruvian election, aimed at mixed audiences of academics, journalists,\u000a        and Peruvian voters living in the UK. The first of these talks was\u000a        delivered at Senate House, University of London, on 3 June 2011, two\u000a        days before the elections. This talk was attended by journalists from\u000a        the Economist, the Guardian, and the BBC. After the\u000a        election, Sobrevilla Perea was invited to give a talk on the election\u000a        results at the London School of Economics on 17 June 2011. This was\u000a        followed by an invitation to participate as one of the main speakers at\u000a        the annual event of the Peru Support Group, held on 29 October 2011,\u000a        analysing the first 100 days of Humala's presidency. In June-July 2013,\u000a        Sobrevilla Perea organized a series of workshops with young people in\u000a        Peru to reflect on the long-term understanding of the events that took\u000a        place in Peru in the 1980s. These workshops used documentaries, videos,\u000a        and video blogs on social platforms (Facebook and Twitter) to spark a\u000a        debate on the importance of history in the understanding of politics and\u000a        of collective memory on the tenth anniversary of the publication of the\u000a        Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Peru.\u000a      \u000aNewspaper and television. One of Sobrevilla Perea's most\u000a        important activities in the on-going debate around Peruvian political\u000a        processes has been a newspaper\u000a          article published in the Guardian on 17 June 2011. This\u000a        article highlighted the plight of the women who underwent forced\u000a        sterilization in the 1990s. The article has contributed to the campaign\u000a        for the reopening of the judicial case against those responsible for the\u000a        sterilization programme. Sobrevilla Perea was also interviewed on the\u000a        Aljazeera television programme Listening Post (broadcast on 24\u000a        September 2011), to discuss the way in which the press covered the 2011\u000a        Peruvian presidential election, and on Jueves a las 3 p.m. con\u000a          Patricia del R&#237;o (broadcast on 14 June 2013), to discuss her work\u000a        with young people on memory.\u000a    \u000a    Reach of the impact:\u000a    \u000a      Over the past five years, Sobrevilla Perea has established herself as\u000a        a public intellectual in Peru, and in March 2012 she was identified as\u000a        one of the eight most influential `nuevas voces en temas de realidad\u000a        nacional' in Revista Somos (the Saturday supplement to the\u000a        Peruvian national newspaper El Comercio).\u000a      Her June 2011 article in Argumentos was the second most widely\u000a        read article in the journal that year, and sparked a campaign among\u000a        111,000 participants on Facebook and Twitter on the legacy of Fujimori\u000a        and the 2011 presidential election, as well as on several well-known\u000a        political blogs in Peru, where it was linked and discussed during the\u000a        election. Her April 2011 article in Argumentos was the third\u000a        most widely read article in the journal during the same period, and it\u000a        also circulated widely on Facebook and Twitter. Several blogs have\u000a        subsequently included links to it. Lawyer Fran&#231;ois Peglau commented:\u000a        `This article circulated like wildfire over the web and was a very\u000a        useful tool in the debate.'\u000a      The meeting at Senate House, London, on 3 June 2011 was attended by\u000a        over 60 people, including representatives of the two election\u000a        candidates, journalists from the Economist, the Guardian,\u000a        and the BBC, investors from the City of London, and members of the\u000a        general public. The financial consultant Julius Abensur wrote: `I was\u000a        extremely impressed at [Sobrevilla Perea's] ability to present a\u000a        dispassionate analysis of the political scenarios unfolding in Peru'\u000a        (5.7). Lawyer Fran&#231;ois Peglau wrote that Sobrevilla Perea was able to\u000a        supply a `perspective with her historical analysis, which enriched the\u000a        discussion' (5.7). Journalists and members of the general public,\u000a        alongside academics and over 30 students, attended Sobrevilla Perea's\u000a        talk at the London School of Economics on 17 June 2011. Maria Luisa\u000a        Palomino, a participant from Peru, remarked that Sobrevilla Perea\u000a        `demonstrated in-depth knowledge of the topic under discussion' (5.7),\u000a        while Alejandra Irigoin (Lecturer in Economic History, LSE) wrote:\u000a        `Bringing the long historical sweep of the politics of exclusion in a\u000a        place like Peru made for a much richer understanding of the crossroads\u000a        where the country and indeed the region stand today' (5.7).\u000a      Sobrevilla Perea's July 2011 article in the Guardian was\u000a        widely circulated in Peru via blogs, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as\u000a        being syndicated worldwide. The Aljazeera television programme Listening\u000a          Post, on which she appeared in September 2011, was broadcast to an\u000a        international audience in the millions.\u000a      The event held at the National Library in Lima as part of the\u000a        provincial newspaper digitization project (see section 3 above) was\u000a        attended by more than 100 people. These included representatives from\u000a        the most important national newspapers in Peru - El Peruano,\u000a          El Comercio, Correo, and La Rep&#250;blica - as well as\u000a        from state institutions and museums, alongside librarians and\u000a        archivists.\u000a    \u000a    Significance of the impact:\u000a    According to the lawyer Fran&#231;ois Peglau, the impact of Sobrevilla Perea's\u000a      research in both informing and changing the quality of the political\u000a      debate around the 2011 election was significant, especially given the\u000a      small margin (3%) by which Fujimori lost the election to Humala (5.7). In\u000a      November 2011, the judicial process against those accused of being\u000a      responsible for the forced sterilization programme commenced at the\u000a      Inter-American Court. Since the medical records of the sterilized women\u000a      have been destroyed, the judicial process will only be able to proceed on\u000a      the basis of testimonies. Ines Ruiz (under the supervision of Sobrevilla\u000a      Perea) began taking testimonies from women in the communities of\u000a      Huancabamba in the northern Peruvian Andes in 2012. Josefa Ramirez Pe&#241;a\u000a      from the Instituto de Apoyo al Movimiento Aut&#243;nomo de Mujeres Campesinas\u000a      wrote that, after the first visit, `over 100 women have been inspired to\u000a      come forward and present their cases to strengthen the judicial process'.\u000a    The other strand of Sobrevilla Perea's work that is having significant\u000a      impact is the creation of a centralized repository for digital collections\u000a      of Peruvian newspapers. Providing easy and cost- effective access for a\u000a      wider general public to historical newspapers will substantially improve\u000a      the quality of political debate. Sobrevilla Perea's British Library-funded\u000a      project has already resulted in a collaboration between the largest\u000a      holders of newspapers in Peru (El Comercio, La Rep&#250;blica,\u000a      Pontificia Universidad Cat&#243;lica del Per&#250;, and El Peruano), and the\u000a      creation of a centralized catalogue at the National Library in Lima. This\u000a      work has also ensured the preservation of newspaper collections in\u000a      Huancavelica and Ayacucho.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact of Natalia Sobrevilla Perea's research on Peruvian political\u000a      history has been to transform the public understanding of the importance\u000a      of constitutions and elections in the search for political legitimacy in\u000a      Peru. This impact has been achieved through engagements in the media\u000a      (public online discussions, public presentations, and newspaper articles),\u000a      as well as through a two-phase British Library-funded project to catalogue\u000a      and digitize newspapers held in provincial Peruvian archives. The reach\u000a      and significance of the impact achieved by Sobrevilla Perea's research is\u000a      evidenced by her being identified in the 3 March 2012 issue of Revista\u000a        Somos (the Saturday supplement to the Peruvian newspaper El\u000a        Comercio) as one of the eight most influential new voices commenting\u000a      on, and contributing to, national debate in Peru.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Kent\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Kent (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Kent","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007150}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3936456","Name":"Lima"},{"GeoNamesId":"3947019","Name":"Ayacucho"},{"GeoNamesId":"3936456","Name":"Lima Peru"},{"GeoNamesId":"3939470","Name":"Huancavelica"}],"References":"\u000a    Outputs:\u000a    \u000a1.

The key research finding in this article is that, in the\u000a    Peruvian context, constitutions were crucial for political legitimacy &#8212;\u000a    even, and indeed especially, for regimes that had taken power by force of\u000a    arms.\u000a    In a subsequent article on the power of patronage in Peruvian politics,\u000a      published in The Americas (2010a), Sobrevilla Perea argued that\u000a      political patronage lay at the heart of nineteenth-century Latin America\u000a      society. Focusing on a typical provincial centre in the department of\u000a      Cuzco, Peru, she concluded that, in order to understand the limits of\u000a      mid-nineteenth-century political reforms, it is necessary to reconstruct\u000a      how elections were actually carried out. The crucial political role played\u000a      by newspapers, and in particular by the regional press, became evident in\u000a      this research, which led to a further article on the importance of\u000a      constitutions in Peru (2010b) and an investigation of the historical role\u000a      of elections and the access of Indians to voting (2011c).\u000a    In an article published in the European History Quarterly on the\u000a      officers defeated at the battle of Ayacucho in 1824 (2011b), Sobrevilla\u000a      Perea traced how the disintegration of the Hispanic Empire and the\u000a      reactions to the Cadiz Constitution led to political instability both in\u000a      Spain and in Latin America. This historical perspective finds its fullest\u000a      articulation in Sobrevilla Perea's 2011 monograph on Andr&#233;s de Santa Cruz\u000a      (2011a), in which she charts his career from his birth in La Paz in 1792\u000a      to his attempts to shape the newly established republics, and to create\u000a      the Peru- Bolivia Confederation (1836-39). One of the principal findings\u000a      of this research was that the ultimate failure of this confederation had\u000a      far-reaching political consequences, with important implications for the\u000a      present-day political scene in Peru.\u000a    Following on from this insight, Sobrevilla Perea has also focused on\u000a      constitutions and elections in modern Peru, and in particular on the ways\u000a      in which they are used to achieve political legitimacy. In this second\u000a      strand to her work on Peruvian politics, she has situated current\u000a      political processes within a broader historical context, and thereby\u000a      demonstrated the centrality of elections and the importance of\u000a      constitutions, as they provide possibilities for political transformation.\u000a    Sobrevilla Perea's research has led to her supervision of a doctoral\u000a      project by Ines Ruiz (PhD student in Hispanic Studies at Kent, since 2011)\u000a      on the victims of the forced sterilization programme in Peru during the\u000a      1990s (under Alberto Fujimori's presidency). This research includes both\u000a      an information-gathering dimension (the recording of the victims'\u000a      experiences) and an analysis of the reception of this sterilization\u000a      programme in Peruvian society more generally. It has found evidence to\u000a      demonstrate that racism, and the perception of the victims as uneducated\u000a      `others', was a key factor in making this abuse possible and, indeed,\u000a      widely accepted.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"932","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aImpact activities:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000aExhibition.

The entire\u000d\u000aexhibition was then presented at the Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh (12 November-18\u000d\u000aDecember 2011). Visitor numbers were over 4,500. The exhibition gave the research team\u000d\u000athe opportunity to show to the general public the creative works that had been produced by\u000d\u000athe students participating in the project, as well as a number of artworks (including artists'\u000d\u000abooks, prints, digital poetry, and experimental films) commissioned by the AHRC project\u000d\u000ateam from professional artists. The commissioning of collaborative artworks as part of the\u000d\u000aresearch advanced creativity by bringing together poets, artists, sculptors, and printmakers,\u000d\u000awith the stimulation of an invitation to engage specifically with the aesthetic and technical\u000d\u000aissues arising from the interaction of visual and poetic forms. Creative artists involved in\u000d\u000athis aspect of the project included distinguished poets (John Burnside, Robin Robertson,\u000d\u000aThomas A. Clark, and Deryn Rees-Jones) and visual artists (Will Maclean and David\u000d\u000aBellingham), as well as the film-maker Sarah Turner. In a few cases, the collaborations built\u000d\u000aon existing connections; in most cases, however, new creative partnerships were\u000d\u000aestablished across media; for instance, with the digital poets Giselle Beiguelman and John\u000d\u000aCayley. The opening advisers' workshop of the `Poetry Beyond Text' project (held at Kent in\u000d\u000aMay 2009) led to Cayley's creative work responding to the output of pilot eye-tracking\u000d\u000aexperiments; subsequently this work, under the title The Readers' Project, was included in\u000d\u000athe project exhibition at Dundee Contemporary Arts in March 2011.\u000d\u000a\u000aProject website. The `Poetry Beyond Text' project website was designed as a public\u000d\u000aresource, and includes accessible articles on genres and methods as well as information on\u000d\u000athe project, its findings, news, events, etc. The online gallery provides images of all the\u000d\u000acommissioned works, as well as some of the actual works (digital poems and videos). The\u000d\u000awebsite continues to be developed as a public resource.\u000d\u000a\u000aA series of public debates. Discussions of the process of collaborative creation have\u000d\u000aincluded numerous public events: Helen Douglas with Valerie Gillies (at the opening of the\u000d\u000aDundee exhibition in March 2011); Deryn Rees-Jones with Marion Smith (at the Scottish\u000d\u000aPoetry Library on 18 May 2011); Jim Carruth with Murray Robertson and Michael Waight\u000d\u000a(at the Scottish Poetry Library on 7 June 2011). These events have shown how the\u000d\u000aproject's collaboration with artists has prompted new insights into formal and thematic\u000d\u000aaspects of creative practice. One element of the project, known as `Chinese Whispers', was\u000d\u000ainspired by debates about `visual thinking', and involved art students being asked to\u000d\u000arespond in purely visual form to poems by Wallace Stevens (`Anecdote of the Jar') and Jim\u000d\u000aCarruth (`Seasons'). The resulting artworks (in a range of media) were then presented to\u000d\u000apoets, who were asked - without knowledge of the original poems - to respond in poetic\u000d\u000aform. This sequence of `translations' between verbal and visual media was repeated a\u000d\u000anumber of times. A public discussion of the process held at the Scottish Poetry Library in\u000d\u000aJune 2011 showed that this exercise had stimulated new creativity in all those involved (see\u000d\u000abelow), as well as offering poets and artists an opportunity to exhibit their work.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aReach of the impact:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThe Poetry Beyond Text exhibition attracted considerable public interest, especially during\u000d\u000aits period at the Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh (autumn 2011), with over 4,500\u000d\u000avisitors in total. Visitors with diverse interests have commented on the stimulating nature of\u000d\u000athese exhibitions, as shown, for example, in the visitors' books (see selected extracts in\u000d\u000a`Significance of the impact' below). The creative dimension to the project included emerging\u000d\u000avisual artists and poets, and also art students, whose careers and profiles have been\u000d\u000aenhanced by the opportunity to exhibit and to engage in a collective process of creative\u000d\u000aresearch.\u000d\u000aThe website is a developing resource, offering access to the research activities and\u000d\u000afindings in a manner that is designed to appeal to the non-specialist.\u000d\u000aThe public debates and workshops were held at non-HEI venues (Dundee Contemporary\u000d\u000aArts; Scottish Poetry Library) in order to encourage the presence and participation of those\u000d\u000aoutside academia. The events were held at the Scottish Poetry Library in Edinburgh (24\u000d\u000aMay 2011), at DG Arts in Dumfries (3 June 2011), and in Kilmarnock as part of the Ayrshire\u000d\u000aCouncil Imprint Festival (10 November 2011). At each session the participants included\u000d\u000acreative writers and artists, primary- and secondary-school teachers, and interested\u000d\u000amembers of the general public. Specific statements of impact recorded in written feedback\u000d\u000aon these workshops included a primary-school teacher who commented: `it's inspired me to\u000d\u000atake this idea into the classroom'; a high-school teacher who wrote that s\/he planned to `do\u000d\u000athe task [a cut-up exercise based on one of the project experiments] with my own students';\u000d\u000aa poet who wrote: 'I will use these techniques to write concrete poems'; and an artist who\u000d\u000awrote: `I'm going to pursue this creatively through my work'.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aSignificance of the impact:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThe `Poetry Beyond Text' project has contributed to the critical understanding of processes\u000d\u000aof reading in a range of genres and media, demonstrating that when participants encounter\u000d\u000alinguistic signs arranged in an orderly pictorial fashion, the immediate reaction is to adopt a\u000d\u000aclassical reading approach. Only if that is not possible, or not informative, do they adopt a\u000d\u000adifferent scanning approach. The impact of these findings has been achieved above all in\u000d\u000athe field of the creative arts, with artists having been invited to respond to the research\u000d\u000afindings. The poet Deryn Rees-Jones, for instance, has commented on the impact of the\u000d\u000aproject on her writing of the poem-photograph `The Wren's Egg', which became the title\u000d\u000apoem of the T.S. Eliot Prize-shortlisted, Poetry Book Society-recommended, and Times\u000d\u000aLiterary Supplement `Book of the Year' collection Burying the Wren (2012). Rees-Jones\u000d\u000aobserves that the `Poetry Beyond Text' project enabled her `to think visually about\u000d\u000alanguage' (5.7). In addition, the Scottish Poetry Library has commented that as a result of\u000d\u000athe project it was `able to bring interesting content and discussions to our wide range of\u000d\u000alibrary users and visitors', with `inspiring insight into both the creative process and the\u000d\u000areading process' (5.8).\u000d\u000aOne of the follow-up projects, `Archive of Reading', is a public resource, making accessible\u000d\u000athe experimental results gathered during the `Poetry Beyond Text' project. It is housed at\u000d\u000athe Scottish Poetry Library in Edinburgh, and was also funded by the Arts and Humanities\u000d\u000aResearch Council. The archive was launched as part of the Poetry Beyond Text exhibition,\u000d\u000aheld at the Scottish Poetry Library from 14 May to 17 July 2011. This archive brings\u000d\u000atogether `readings' of different types recorded in various forms. It includes heat maps, eye-tracking videos, reported readings, and fixation maps, as well as original artworks and\u000d\u000apoems created as 'readings' of one another during the `Chinese Whispers' series. The\u000d\u000a`Archive of Reading' can be accessed via computer in the Scottish Poetry Library.\u000d\u000aThrough the exhibitions and the website, the project has fostered a greater awareness of\u000d\u000ahow readers vacillate between viewing and reading modes when confronted with hybrid\u000d\u000astructures that bring together textual and visual elements. Evidence that the project\u000d\u000aexhibition in particular has impacted significantly on the way in which a diverse international\u000d\u000apublic thinks about the relation between text and image is to be found, for instance, in the\u000d\u000acomments made in the exhibition visitors' book of the Moray Arts Centre, Findhorn (5.6).\u000d\u000aThese comments include: `I particularly enjoyed the poem of the dog's hair and the image\u000d\u000aof someone's back before they died - and the river flowing text and the strange\u000d\u000a\"massiveness\" of the \"Wren\" procession.' (Peter Fraser, Melbourne, Australia, 25 Aug.\u000d\u000a2011); `Thank you for the inspiration.' (Erin O'Byrne, Vancouver, Canada, 8 Sept. 2011);\u000d\u000a`The possibilities of text! Some very affecting pieces.' (S. Leggett, 8 Sept. 2011); `Wonderful\u000d\u000aand innovative and thought-provoking.' (C. Roy, Canada, 16 Sept. 2011).\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThe impact of the research undertaken for the collaborative AHRC-funded project `Poetry Beyond\u000d\u000aText: Vision, Text and Cognition' (2009-11) has been the generation of a new awareness of\u000d\u000areading and viewing behaviours in the digital age among the creative artists who were invited to\u000d\u000arespond to the project's research and visitors to the project's travelling exhibition. The `Poetry\u000d\u000aBeyond Text' project studied artworks that combine visual art (patterns, painted images,\u000d\u000aphotographs, digital images) with poetic text. The research identified psychological processes in\u000d\u000athe reception of such works, and analysed the creative and collaborative processes involved in\u000d\u000atheir making. The impact of this research was achieved in three main areas: (1) the public\u000d\u000aunderstanding of specific art forms such as digital poetry, artists' books, and concrete poetry; (2)\u000d\u000athe practice of commissioned artists and writers; (3) the policy and public profile of partner non-HEIs, notably the Scottish Poetry Library. 1 and 3 were primarily within Scotland, but 2 was both\u000d\u000anational and international, including artists and writers from the UK, the United States, and Brazil.\u000d\u000aThe pathways to impact were the project's Poetry Beyond Text exhibition, a website featuring an\u000d\u000aonline gallery and educational materials, and a series of debates open to the public.\u000d\u000a","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000aUniversity of Kent\u000d\u000a","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Kent (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Kent","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007150}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"6173331","Name":"Vancouver"},{"GeoNamesId":"2158177","Name":"Melbourne"}],"References":"\u000d\u000aAHRC-Funded Research Project:\u000d\u000aAHRC `Beyond Text' Large Grant (&#163;472,617) for the `Poetry Beyond Text: Vision, Text and\u000d\u000aCognition' project (March 2009-February 2011).

For the AHRC-funded `Poetry Beyond Text: Vision, Text and Cognition' research project (2009-11), Schaffner\u000d\u000a(Co-Investigator with responsibility for leading the project at the University of Kent) worked with a\u000d\u000acolleague in the Department of Psychology (Weger) and a postdoctoral researcher (Knowles, now\u000d\u000aa Lecturer in Film Studies at the University of Aberystwyth) in the Department of Comparative\u000d\u000aLiterature at Kent, as well as with the research team at the University of Dundee led by Roberts, to\u000d\u000ainvestigate what happens when readers are presented with artworks that combine text and image.\u000d\u000aThis interdisciplinary project drew its theoretical and methodological tools from the fields of literary\u000d\u000atheory, art theory, and experimental psychology. It took account in particular of: (1) the latest\u000d\u000aresearch on the history and theory of digital poetry, pattern poetry, and concrete poetry; and (2)\u000d\u000arecent behavioural studies into the perception, comprehension, and recollection of texts, images,\u000d\u000aand auditory materials.\u000d\u000aThe psychological approaches employed in the project included cognitive research relying on\u000d\u000amental chronometry, eye-tracking, EEG scans, and subjective rating studies. The use of these\u000d\u000aexperimental methods in the analysis of the ways in which poetry is read led to the development of\u000d\u000aa `reflective feedback loop', in which participants in the experiments (undergraduate and\u000d\u000apostgraduate students studying literature, philosophy, film, and fine art) were invited to act as co-researchers. The participants' cognitive processes were assessed through eye-tracking and EEG\u000d\u000ascans in the viewing of three different kinds of artwork: (1) text poetry accompanied by images\u000d\u000a(photographs or drawings); (2) concrete or pattern poetry; and (3) digital poetry (including images\u000d\u000aor text-shapes). Some participants were then asked to produce artworks of their own in response\u000d\u000ato the experiments. Experimental procedures included: (1) modifying the layout of the text; (2)\u000d\u000aadding or removing specific modalities (for example, the same text with and without photographs);\u000d\u000aand (3) studying how reading strategies (such as the pattern of looking at visual poetry or texts with\u000d\u000aimages, or interacting with digital poetry), affect memory, interpretation, and perceived aesthetic\u000d\u000avalue. The research undertaken at Kent focused primarily on the analysis of reading patterns\u000d\u000arelated to concrete and pattern poetry, digital poetry, and text film.\u000d\u000aThe principal findings of this research were based on the collection and analysis of empirical data\u000d\u000aon how spatial parameters in literary texts are actually `read' and integrated into the interpretative\u000d\u000aprocess. One of the primary findings that emerged from the eye-tracking experiments conducted at\u000d\u000athe University of Kent is that when participants encounter linguistic signs that are arranged in\u000d\u000apictorial but ordered fashion, the initial response is to adopt a classical reading approach. Only if\u000d\u000athat is not possible, or not informative, does the viewer opt for a more varied scanning approach.\u000d\u000aThis corroborates the findings of an earlier experiment, the well-known Stroop test. This test\u000d\u000aestablished that linguistic information is automatically accessed, even when readers direct their\u000d\u000aattention to visual information. In other words, automatized codes (verbal meaning) cannot be\u000d\u000aignored or inhibited easily, even while participants attend to the visual aspects of words, which in\u000d\u000athe case of the Stroop test were colours, and in the `Poetry Beyond Text' experiments spatially\u000d\u000aarranged linguistic signs.\u000d\u000aThese findings were disseminated in various forms: on the project website; in the travelling Poetry\u000d\u000aBeyond Text exhibition and the accompanying exhibition catalogue; at conferences; and in journal\u000d\u000apublications. In `Reading Space: New Cognitive Perspectives' (Knowles et al. 2012a), for instance,\u000d\u000atheoretical claims regarding the alleged function of spatial values in visual poetry were integrated\u000d\u000awith results from a series of eye-tracking and other empirical experiments, which tested how\u000d\u000apeople read, understand, and respond to spaces between units of meaning in a selection of visual\u000d\u000apoems ranging from works by St&#233;phane Mallarm&#233;, Guillaume Apollinaire, and e.e. cummings to\u000d\u000aconcrete poems by, among others, Eugen Gomringer, Claus Bremer, and Ian Hamilton Finlay. The\u000d\u000aexperiments emerged from, and responded to, the subject of space in literary theory and word-image discourse, seeking empirical answers to theoretical questions, and revealing new insights\u000d\u000ainto the reception, cognitive processing, and interpretation of visual poetry, above all the fact that\u000d\u000athe classical reading approach is generally adopted even when linguistic signs are presented to the\u000d\u000aeye in a pictorial manner.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"933","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Read's research and publications have contributed to a major\u000a      international reassessment of Apollinaire's art criticism.

This\u000a      impact has been achieved by Read's own publications, public lectures, and\u000a      media appearances, and has also been mediated through reference to Read's\u000a      research in the work of other researchers, writers, and commentators.\u000a    Impact activities:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a Exhibitions and exhibition catalogues. As a\u000a        result of his research into the creative exchanges between writers and\u000a        artists in France in the early decades of the twentieth century, Read\u000a        was invited to contribute to exhibition catalogues and to act as an\u000a        adviser for two exhibitions at the new Centre\u000a          Pompidou-Metz, France. Read has contributed to various exhibition\u000a        catalogues since 2008, including a series of essays for the\u000a        encyclopaedic catalogue of the exhibition 1917, the second major\u000a        exhibition held at the Centre Pompidou- Metz (2011). Read's\u000a        contributions to the catalogue (on two theatre productions, the art\u000a        market, the work of Picasso, and daily life in Paris in 1917), his\u000a        earlier publications, meetings in Metz and Paris, and correspondence\u000a        with curators helped to shape the organization and presentation of\u000a        sections of the exhibition, particularly the importance given to\u000a        collaborative projects realized by artists and writers, and to\u000a        experimental home-front stage productions in 1917, all presented in ways\u000a        designed to engage directly with a wide international audience. His\u000a        on-going interdisciplinary research on cultural events during the First\u000a        World War, and particularly on Picasso and Cocteau, led to his being\u000a        commissioned to write the text for the illustrated book to accompany the\u000a        follow-up exhibition at the Centre Pompidou-Metz, on the ballet Parade\u000a        (17 November 2012 to 18 March 2013). Parade was produced in May\u000a        1917 by Diaghilev's Russian Ballet, and written, composed, designed, and\u000a        choreographed by Cocteau, Satie, Picasso, and Massine.

Work on\u000a        this book included meetings with the exhibition curators to discuss\u000a        material to be included in the exhibition. In addition to his work for\u000a        the Centre Pompidou-Metz, Read was also commissioned to write an essay\u000a        for the catalogue of Picasso in Paris 1900-1907 (an exhibition\u000a        held at the Van Gogh and Picasso Museums, Amsterdam and Barcelona, in\u000a        2011). This catalogue was published in separate editions in five\u000a        languages (Catalan, Dutch, English, French, and Spanish). In addition to\u000a        his contributions to exhibition catalogues, Read has also delivered a\u000a        series of public lectures at La Halle St Pierre, Paris (November 2008),\u000a        the Picasso Museum, Antibes (February 2010), the Montpellier Book-Fair\u000a        (June 2012), and the Centre Pompidou-Metz (September 2012). Read's\u000a        recent research on Picasso's first studios in Paris and his interest in\u000a        Darwinism underpinned a series of illustrated public lectures on the\u000a        intellectual and literary environment that fostered Picasso's early\u000a        creativity, with venues including the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (March\u000a        2011). Read's research on literary connections in modern sculpture, and\u000a        on Giacometti's reading, writing, and illustrating of literary texts\u000a        (presented in Read and Kelly 2009b), led to a conference on European\u000a        poetry and sculpture (organized by Read and Hutchinson) held at the\u000a        Henry Moore Institute, Leeds (November 2009). This one-day event\u000a        provided a forum not only for academics, but also for creative artists,\u000a        curators, and members of the public to meet, discuss, and interact.\u000a      \u000aPublications in the press. Read developed and synthesized\u000a        his accumulated research on Picasso's life and work, and the context in\u000a        which the artist operated, in a special `Picasso' issue of the popular\u000a        French monthly magazine L'Histoire, for which Read was\u000a        consultant and principal contributor (October 2008). He is also a\u000a        regular contributor to the Times Literary Supplement (seven\u000a        reviews and features on modern French literature and the visual arts\u000a        since 2008).\u000a      \u000aRadio programmes. Read has contributed to radio programmes\u000a        on French and Swiss national radio: Radio France, France Culture, Les\u000a          nouveaux chemins de la connaissance, a 50-minute live programme\u000a        featuring Read speaking on eroticism in the writings of Apollinaire\u000a        (broadcast on 22 June 2009); Radio Suisse Romande, Entre les lignes,\u000a        a one- hour programme featuring Read speaking on Apollinaire, Correspondance\u000a          avec les artistes and related topics (broadcast on 4 January\u000a        2010).\u000a\u000a      Reach of the impact:\u000a      \u000a        Over 200,000 tickets were bought for the exhibition 1917 at\u000a          the Centre Pompidou-Metz.\u000a        71,800 copies were sold of the 2008 `Picasso' special issue of the\u000a          French monthly L'Histoire, for which Read was the principal\u000a          consultant and contributor. The Times Literary Supplement, to\u000a          which Read is a regular contributor on modern French literature and\u000a          art, has a readership of c. 100,000, of which half is in the USA.\u000a        The French and Swiss national radio programmes to which Read\u000a          contributed (Radio France, France Culture, Les nouveaux chemins de\u000a            la connaissance; Radio Suisse Romande, Entre les lignes)\u000a          have 100,000+ national audiences.\u000a      \u000a      Significance of the impact:\u000a      Through his contributions to exhibition catalogues, his scholarly\u000a        publications, the wealth of new documents he has made available (in\u000a        French and often in English translation), his public lectures in both\u000a        languages, his contributions to national radio broadcasts, and his\u000a        regular journalism, Read has substantially shifted public perceptions of\u000a        the interplay between art and literature in twentieth-century France.\u000a        Countering received wisdom and earlier art-historical judgements (often\u000a        based on poor translations and limited documentation), Read's research\u000a        and publications have contributed to the international reassessment of\u000a        Apollinaire's art criticism and his influential participation in the\u000a        development of literary and artistic modernism. In particular, Read has\u000a        made Apollinaire's hitherto unknown drawings available to a mainstream\u000a        audience. More broadly, he has shown the public how artists respond\u000a        creatively to their cultural environment and particularly to the\u000a        literary company they keep, most notably in his publications on Picasso,\u000a        Giacometti, and Dufy. Furthermore, Read has helped to inform exhibition\u000a        curators at the Centre Pompidou-Metz regarding exhibition content,\u000a        thereby ensuring that misconceptions have been avoided in the\u000a        presentation of these exhibitions to the public.\u000a      Read's work has been highlighted and recommended to a wide general\u000a        audience, notably by John Richardson in his bestselling Life of\u000a          Picasso: `there is no better guide than Read's excellent study, Picasso\u000a          et Apollinaire' (iii. 349); by Neil Cox in his Tate publication The\u000a          Picasso Book: Read's book is `riveting'; and the 2009 Yale\u000a        exhibition catalogue Picasso and the Allure of Language: Read's\u000a        Picasso and Apollinaire is `a key publication'. Read's\u000a        publications are also, for example, extensively cited throughout\u000a        Laurence Campa's landmark biography of Apollinaire, published by\u000a        Gallimard in 2013, with an English-language edition in preparation.\u000a      ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact described in this case study is the significant enhancement of\u000a      the public understanding and appreciation of the work of the French writer\u000a      Guillaume Apollinaire, notably through greater awareness of the quality of\u000a      the work resulting from his creative dialogues with Pablo Picasso and\u000a      other visual artists. This impact has been achieved through Peter Read's\u000a      collaborations with museum curators (especially at the Centre Pompidou in\u000a      Metz, France), and through the dissemination of his archival research\u000a      findings in major exhibition catalogues, illustrated books, magazine and\u000a      newspaper articles, public lectures, and radio broadcasts. Read's research\u000a      has also been cited in influential works by other critics, biographers,\u000a      and historians. As a result, Read's research is now a key point of\u000a      reference in the public discussion of Apollinaire, Picasso, and other\u000a      Paris-based writers and artists of the early twentieth century.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Kent\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Kent (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Kent","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007150}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2988507","Name":"Paris"},{"GeoNamesId":"2759794","Name":"Amsterdam"},{"GeoNamesId":"2992166","Name":"Montpellier"},{"GeoNamesId":"3128760","Name":"Barcelona"},{"GeoNamesId":"2994160","Name":"Metz"},{"GeoNamesId":"3037456","Name":"Antibes"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

This research culminated\u000a      in a monograph published by the University of California Press in 2008\u000a      (Read 2008a; paperback edition in 2010). In this book, Read built on\u000a      earlier work on this topic and presented the first comprehensive picture\u000a      of the creative interplay between Apollinaire and Picasso, and how this\u000a      related to Apollinaire's posthumous presence in Picasso's later life and\u000a      work. Read's research was significantly enriched by the access he was\u000a      granted to previously unavailable archival material, which included: the\u000a      complete correspondence received by Apollinaire, deposited at the\u000a      Biblioth&#232;que Nationale de France (BNF) by the poet's estate; private\u000a      journals, diaries, and other manuscripts newly acquired by the BNF at\u000a      auction; new primary material held at the Biblioth&#232;que litt&#233;raire Jacques\u000a      Doucet; Apollinaire's personal annotated library of books, periodicals,\u000a      and catalogues, now held at the Biblioth&#232;que Historique de la Ville de\u000a      Paris (BHVP); and extensive uncatalogued collections of primary and\u000a      secondary materials recently deposited at the BHVP by pioneering\u000a      Apollinaire specialists Marcel Ad&#233;ma and Michel D&#233;caudin. Support from\u000a      curators also enabled Read to access press-cuttings, correspondence, and\u000a      manuscripts at the Mus&#233;e Picasso and the Matisse estate in Paris. This\u000a      research revealed further possible lines of archival enquiry into\u000a      Apollinaire's hitherto completely unresearched drawings and paintings, and\u000a      his very extensive unresearched correspondence with European,\u000a      Scandinavian, and American artists. These topics were explored\u000a      collaboratively by Read with French colleagues Claude Debon and Laurence\u000a      Campa, resulting in two outputs: Les Dessins de Guillaume Apollinaire\u000a      (Debon and Read 2008b) and the Gallimard volume Guillaume Apollinaire.\u000a        Correspondance avec les artistes 1903-1918 (Campa and Read 2009a).\u000a    Les Dessins de Guillaume Apollinaire presents hundreds of the\u000a      poet's previously unpublished drawings and paintings. In preparing this\u000a      volume, Read and Debon worked together to revisit all the poet's\u000a      manuscripts now held in public collections and museums in France, noting\u000a      the presence of drawings, doodles, and paintings; they then extended the\u000a      search to private collections, auction catalogues, and periodicals\u000a      published since 1920. Further library and museum research enhanced the\u000a      accompanying critical apparatus (introductions, commentaries, captions,\u000a      and notes equally divided between the two specialists). Guillaume\u000a        Apollinaire. Correspondance avec les artistes 1903-1918 presents the\u000a      poet's previously unpublished correspondence with 117 artists. The main\u000a      corpus of the correspondence received by Apollinaire is now at the BNF,\u000a      where Read was granted access to original manuscripts (rather than\u000a      microfilms) to facilitate the task of transcription. Other correspondence\u000a      to and from Apollinaire was mainly located in public and private archives\u000a      and libraries in France, Italy, and Norway. The letters and very extensive\u000a      annotations give unrivalled access to all kinds of artistic activity &#8212;\u000a      traditional, modern, and avant-garde &#8212; in France and across Europe before\u000a      and during the Great War.\u000a    Read has also undertaken research into the relationship before and during\u000a      the First World War between Apollinaire and the psychiatrist Dr Jean\u000a      Vinchon. From around 1913, Vinchon pioneered art as therapy for his\u000a      patients at Saint-Anne psychiatric hospital in Paris. Read researched\u000a      Vinchon's role as psychiatrist and therapist, as an early collector of and\u000a      writer on schizophrenic art, his relationship and correspondence with\u000a      Apollinaire, the poet's previously undocumented visits to Saint-Anne, and\u000a      the inclusion of psychoanalytic theory, vocabulary, and imagery in his\u000a      writing, drawings, and paintings. In addition, Read researched Vinchon's\u000a      contacts with early surrealism in the 1920s. He explored material in\u000a      public collections, including correspondence received by Apollinaire from\u000a      Vinchon, and he was also granted access by Vinchon's family to the\u000a      doctor's papers and library, which include previously unpublished material\u000a      by Apollinaire. The outcome was a substantial article published in the Revue\u000a        des sciences humaines (Read 2012) which defines with new precision\u000a      the sources and contours of Apollinaire's knowledge of psychoanalysis,\u000a      shows how this knowledge shaped some of his major poems and other works,\u000a      and became an essential part of his legacy to younger poets, including\u000a      Andr&#233; Breton, Louis Aragon, and Philippe Soupault.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1026","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A number of key recommendations made in the Review of Irish-Medium\u000d\u000a        Education have been implemented by government, resulting in\u000d\u000a      significant benefits for the Irish-speaking community.

Deficiencies in the provision of\u000d\u000a      training for IME schools identified in the review (see Recommendation 14)\u000d\u000a      have been addressed in a number of key areas, for example through the\u000d\u000a      funding of increased PGCE places for post-primary and accredited training\u000d\u000a      for pre-school teachers (see DE Action Plan 2012, pp. 11-17).\u000d\u000a    Department of Education policy on funded pre-school provision has been\u000d\u000a      revised in the light of Recommendation 2, and registered Irish-medium\u000d\u000a      providers with sufficient children will now receive funding even where\u000d\u000a      English-medium provision is available in the area (DE Action Plan p.1).\u000d\u000a      Measures have also been taken to ensure sustainable provision in the IME\u000d\u000a      sector (Recommendations 6-10). Most notably, area-based planning and\u000d\u000a      federated leadership models have been implemented, sub-standard\u000d\u000a      accommodation is being replaced and, where required, new accommodation\u000d\u000a      provided as part of DE annual major\/minor works programmes (see DE Action\u000d\u000a      Plan pp. 3-7).\u000d\u000a    Key recommendations contained in Languages for the Future: Northern\u000d\u000a        Ireland Languages Strategy (NILS) have also been implemented and are\u000d\u000a      having a substantial effect upon the community in Northern Ireland.\u000d\u000a      Government has made NILS available on the Department of Education website\u000d\u000a      and encouraged all schools in Northern Ireland to download it (see http:\/\/www.deni.gov.uk\/languages_for_the_future.pdf).\u000d\u000a    As a result of Recommendation 1.3 (NILS p. 13), a Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a      Languages Council Steering Committee was established (April 2013) with\u000d\u000a      support from the Department of Education. The steering committee is tasked\u000d\u000a      with establishing a NI Languages Council to provide an umbrella\u000d\u000a      organisation for stake holders, provide advice on language matters and\u000d\u000a      oversee the implementation of the NI Languages Strategy. Twenty\u000d\u000a      organisations were represented at the launch of the Steering Committee,\u000d\u000a      including representatives from the business sector, community\u000d\u000a      organisations and the education sector (see Sources to corroborate: NILS\u000d\u000a      website). &#211; Corr&#225;in, one of the co-authors of Languages for the\u000d\u000a        Future: Northern Ireland Languages Strategy is a member of the NI\u000d\u000a      Languages Council Steering Committee. Government has given its support to\u000d\u000a      our recommendation that learning opportunities for sign languages should\u000d\u000a      be improved (Recommendation 3.2, NILS p. 31, see also discussion p. 60 and\u000d\u000a      Recommendation 9.3 p. 61), and in 2012, with the support of the Department\u000d\u000a      for Employment and Learning (DEL) and DENI, a new Sign Language\u000d\u000a      Interpreter Course was established at Belfast Metropolitan College (See\u000d\u000a      evidence base).\u000d\u000a    Following our recommendations that steps be taken to vigorously promote\u000d\u000a      our indigenous languages (Recommendations 11.1 and 11.2, p.63), the\u000d\u000a      Minister for Education announced (3 October 2012) that he was providing\u000d\u000a      &#163;230,000 in funding to support programmes to encourage children, parents\u000d\u000a      and the wider community to develop their Irish language skills (see\u000d\u000a      corroborating statement from Russel Welsh, Head of Curriculum Development\u000d\u000a      DENI); and DCAL is now preparing a consultative document containing\u000d\u000a      proposals for the development of specific strategies for the promotion of\u000d\u000a      Irish and Ulster Scots (Sources to corroborate 4). The Department of\u000d\u000a      Education has also extended its Primary Languages Programme (NILS\u000d\u000a      Recommendation 2.3) to include the teaching of Polish along with Irish and\u000d\u000a      Spanish at primary level (evidence base). The Department of Education is\u000d\u000a      now promoting languages in pre-primary provision (Recommendation 2.2) and\u000d\u000a      in keeping with Recommendation 3.1, schools are now being encouraged to\u000d\u000a      widen their curriculum to include Content and Language Integrated Learning\u000d\u000a      (CLIL), i.e. the teaching of other subjects and topics through a new\u000d\u000a      language. Government has also acted on our recommendation that\u000d\u000a      non-traditional languages be promoted (Recommendation 3.3) and, with the\u000d\u000a      support of both the Northern Ireland and Chinese governments, the\u000d\u000a      Confucius Institute was launched at the University of Ulster and courses\u000d\u000a      in Chinese established (see http:\/\/www.ulster.ac.uk\/confucius\/launch.php).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research carried out within the Irish and Celtic Studies Research\u000d\u000a      Institute has had a direct impact upon government policy in Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland and has led to major benefits for the community. Our research into\u000d\u000a      language rights, language and identity, the Irish language in Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland and minority languages in general has underpinned our\u000d\u000a      collaboration with government in the development of language policy.

De Br&#250;n's research (in particular 2006)\u000d\u000a      highlighted the failure of statutory agencies in Northern Ireland to\u000d\u000a      engage fully with the Irish-medium education sector, not having\u000d\u000a      appreciated its significance as a progressive movement for cultural and\u000d\u000a      social regeneration. This was a vital contribution to establishing the\u000d\u000a      context for the Review, namely the need to address a deficiency in public\u000d\u000a      policy towards the Irish language. Accordingly, one of the Review's key\u000d\u000a      recommendations proposed that the Department of Education should \"ensure\u000d\u000a      that Irish-medium education is considered systemically throughout policy\u000d\u000a      development\" (See Review of Irish-Medium Education Report p.xxi).\u000d\u000a      Acting directly on this recommendation, the Minister for Education\u000d\u000a      established a Standing Group on Irish-Medium Education chaired at\u000d\u000a      under-secretary level and all policy branches are now required `to ensure\u000d\u000a      that Irish-medium education is embedded in the policy development process\u000d\u000a      from the outset' (see evidence base: DE Action Plan 2012, p.28,29).\u000d\u000a    In relation to Languages for the Future: Northern Ireland Languages\u000d\u000a        Strategy (NILS), as a statement from the Department of Education who\u000d\u000a      commissioned the strategy, says: \"The Irish and Celtic Studies Research\u000d\u000a      Institute at the University of Ulster led by Professor &#211; Corr&#225;in has a\u000d\u000a      strong record of research in languages and identity, the Irish language in\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland and minority languages in general and this research\u000d\u000a      underpinned the findings of the Strategy and made a particularly important\u000d\u000a      contribution to those sections which examine the position of Irish within\u000d\u000a      the community and explore social integration and mutual understanding\"\u000d\u000a      (Corroborating statement from Russel Welsh, Head of Curriculum\u000d\u000a      Development, Department of Education).\u000d\u000a    The research carried out by Nic Craith (2003, 2006, 2010) on the\u000d\u000a      importance of official status for languages underpinned our\u000d\u000a      recommendations to government, in particular the recommendation that the\u000d\u000a      provisions of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages must\u000d\u000a      be fully implemented in Northern Ireland (see NILS pp. 55, 57, 59); and\u000d\u000a      research carried out by an ICSRI doctoral student and subsequently\u000d\u000a      published, Migrant Languages in the Public Space: A Case Study from\u000d\u000a        Northern Ireland (McDermott, 2011) underpinned our recommendations\u000d\u000a      on immigrant languages (NILS p. 58).\u000d\u000a    This underpinning research is distilled into Languages for the\u000d\u000a        Future: Northern Ireland Languages Strategy (NILS) published by the\u000d\u000a      Department of Education (DENI) in 2012.

This increased\u000d\u000a      awareness is reflected in highly significant cross-community advances such\u000d\u000a      as the appointment by the East Belfast Mission of an Irish Language\u000d\u000a      Development Officer (Linda Ervine, wife of former Progressive Unionist\u000d\u000a      party leader Brian Ervine) and the establishment in East Belfast of\u000d\u000a      flourishing classes in the language. These developments are featured in a\u000d\u000a      BBC documentary for which de Br&#250;n was interviewed which will be broadcast\u000d\u000a      in November 2013 (see http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/p01klc2f).\u000d\u000a    Our research into the Irish language in an industrialised setting has led\u000d\u000a      to the commissioning by publically-funded and semi-state bodies of other\u000d\u000a      outputs in formats which facilitate wider public dissemination, in\u000d\u000a      particular through television and temporary and permanent exhibitions. A\u000d\u000a      detailed television documentary (Sc&#233;al na Fadgies by de Br&#250;n) was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by TG4 and Northern Ireland Screen's Irish Language Broadcast\u000d\u000a      Fund. A permanent exhibition (by de Br&#250;n &amp; Hughes, 2011) was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by Cult&#250;rlann MacAdam-&#211; Fiaich and was funded by the Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland Tourist Board. A temporary exhibition (de Br&#250;n &amp; Phoenix) was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the cross-border Irish-language body, Foras na Gaeilge\u000d\u000a      for Belfast City Hall's centenary celebrations (see evidence base).\u000d\u000a    The most immediate indicator of the reach and significance of the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research has been alluded to above &#8212; the commissioning by\u000d\u000a      publically-funded or semi-state bodies of other outputs in formats which\u000d\u000a      facilitate wider public dissemination. In each case, this has come about\u000d\u000a      because the funding bodies have identified the potential of our research\u000d\u000a      to inform public discourse in the broad area of cultural heritage and in\u000d\u000a      some cases to deliver specific economic and social benefits, particularly\u000d\u000a      in the area of cultural tourism.\u000d\u000a    The viewing figures for the TV documentary (de Br&#250;n, 2010) demonstrate\u000d\u000a      that 100,000 viewers tuned in to the programme's initial broadcast in May\u000d\u000a      2010 (see Sources to corroborate). Since the initial broadcast, the\u000d\u000a      documentary has been rebroadcast by TG4 on several occasions and was made\u000d\u000a      accessible to a global audience on the TG4 website. The broadcast has led\u000d\u000a      to invitations by local councils and historical\/cultural organisation to\u000d\u000a      give public talks in Belfast, Newry and Omeath (see evidence base).\u000d\u000a    The print and digital interactive, permanent exhibition space for the\u000d\u000a      newly extended and refurbished Cult&#250;rlann MacAdam-&#211; Fiaich was officially\u000d\u000a      opened by Irish President Mary McAleese at a ceremony in September 2011.\u000d\u000a      This event received considerable media coverage and helped to launch the\u000d\u000a      exhibition as one of the key tourist, heritage and educational resources\u000d\u000a      in an area of significant economic and social disadvantage (Falls Road,\u000d\u000a      Belfast). The public use of visitor attractions is monitored by the NI\u000d\u000a      Tourist Bureau and the recent Northern Ireland Statistics and Research\u000d\u000a      Agency report demonstrates (p. 19) that 89,000 members of the public\u000d\u000a      visited the Cult&#250;rlann in 2011 and 101,000 in 2013 (see\u000d\u000a        http:\/\/www.detini.gov.uk\/deti-stats-\u000d\u000a        index\/tourism-statistics\/visitor_attraction_survey-2.htm).\u000d\u000a    The temporary exhibition on the history of the Irish language in Belfast\u000d\u000a      was used as part of the centenary celebrations of Belfast City Hall and\u000d\u000a      went on display in the City Hall after its initial launch at a gala dinner\u000d\u000a      by the DUP Deputy Lord Mayor. Subsequently, the exhibition was displayed\u000d\u000a      in venues in the U.S. as part of an investment tour by the West Belfast\u000d\u000a      Economic Forum and also by Newry and Mourne Council as part of Irish\u000d\u000a      language week in March 2008. The exhibition has also been used by local\u000d\u000a      schools and cultural groups at a wide variety of events (evidence base).\u000d\u000a    The model of progression from traditional academic output (scholarly\u000d\u000a      books\/articles) to impact through popular dissemination (broadcast\/\u000d\u000a      exhibitions) can be equally identified in a number of publically-funded\u000d\u000a      cultural heritage initiatives which have drawn directly on our\u000d\u000a      underpinning research. These have included an audio tour by Fionnt&#225;n de\u000d\u000a      Br&#250;n of Belfast's Irish language heritage for the Culture Northern\u000d\u000a        Ireland website, the creation of tourist signage giving the history\u000d\u000a      of the Irish-speaking community in Bank St, and a historical booklet\u000d\u000a      produced as part of Belfast City Council's Cultural Tourism Strategy,\u000d\u000a      entitled `The Giant's Tale' (see Sources to corroborate). Most recently,\u000d\u000a      as noted above, Belfast City Council's Good Relations Unit has taken the\u000d\u000a      Omeath Irish Language Community in Belfast as a central theme in its\u000d\u000a      cross-community partnership project. A key aim of this project is to\u000d\u000a      enhance mutual understanding across Belfast's sectarian divide.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research by Hughes and de Br&#250;n has also led to the\u000d\u000a      establishment of the ICSRI's highly successful annual `Robert Shipboy\u000d\u000a      MacAdam Memorial Lecture' and annual conference (&#201;igse Loch Lao)\u000d\u000a      which are designed to disseminate the work of the Irish and Celtic Studies\u000d\u000a      Research Institute to the public. The initial proposal to commemorate the\u000d\u000a      life and work of Robert Shipboy MacAdam (1808-1895) was made by the late\u000d\u000a      Prof Breand&#225;n &#211; Buachalla at the launch of Belfast and the Irish\u000d\u000a        Language (de Br&#250;n, 2006a). &#201;igse Loch Lao is the product of\u000d\u000a      a dynamic partnership with the influential Irish Language society, Cumann\u000a        Cult&#250;rtha Mhic Reachtain (The McCracken Cultural Society), who\u000d\u000a      jointly organise the conference along with the Irish and Celtic Studies\u000d\u000a      Research Institute. The 2011 conference was officially opened by the Lord\u000d\u000a      Mayor of Belfast, Niall &#211; Donghaile, and was funded by Foras na\u000d\u000a        Gaeilge and Belfast City Council, while the 2013 conference was\u000d\u000a      attended by the current Lord Mayor M&#225;irt&#237;n &#211; Muilleoir. The themes of\u000d\u000a      these conferences, The Irish Language in Schools, North and South\u000d\u000a      (2011) and Visual Media in the Irish Language (2013) are\u000d\u000a      indicative of our engagement with the public in these key areas. In\u000d\u000a      addition, members of the ICSRI play a leading role in the McCracken\u000d\u000a      Cultural Society and showcase our research on the Irish language in\u000d\u000a      Belfast at the Society's summer school which attracts between 400 and 500\u000d\u000a      students annually.\u000d\u000a    Finally, our research into the history of the Irish language in an urban\u000d\u000a      environment has led to numerous radio, television and newspaper features,\u000d\u000a      some of which are internet accessible (see sources to corroborate).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study demonstrates the social, economic and cultural impact of\u000d\u000a      research carried out by members of the Irish and Celtic Studies Research\u000d\u000a      Institute into the history of the Irish language in Belfast in the\u000d\u000a      nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\u000d\u000a    This research has revealed the extent of Irish language activity in\u000d\u000a      Belfast in the 19th century, focussing on the one hand on\u000d\u000a      Gaelic revivalism and antiquarianism and on the other on the history of an\u000d\u000a      Irish-speaking community who migrated to this urban area from Omeath, Co.\u000d\u000a      Louth. Our research into the Irish language in an urbanised and\u000d\u000a      industrialised setting has been adopted and utilised by the Irish speaking\u000d\u000a      community in Belfast, by Irish language organisations, by the media and by\u000d\u000a      the tourist industry.\u000d\u000a    This case study demonstrates how our research has impacted on the wider\u000d\u000a      community, in particular by tracing its dissemination in the key areas of\u000d\u000a      broadcasting, cultural heritage and tourism initiatives. As an indication\u000d\u000a      of the reach and significance of this impact, it is shown inter alia\u000d\u000a      that a television documentary describing the findings of our research\u000d\u000a      achieved very significant viewing figures (over 100,000 on its first\u000d\u000a      showing); a permanent exhibition illustrating the history of native Irish\u000d\u000a      speakers in Belfast has become a major tourist attraction in an\u000d\u000a      economically disadvantaged area of Belfast; a cross-community cultural\u000d\u000a      heritage project on this urban gaeltacht was funded by Belfast City\u000d\u000a      Council and a specially commissioned drama was produced by Aisling Gh&#233;ar\u000d\u000a      Theatre. Furthermore, a transportable exhibition on the Irish language in\u000d\u000a      Belfast formed part of the centenary celebrations of Belfast City Hall and\u000d\u000a      went on tour to the United States as part of an investment drive by the\u000d\u000a      West Belfast Economic Forum.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Ulster\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Ulster (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Ulster","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Northern Ireland","UKPRN":10007807}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    As evidence for the quality of the underpinning research, it can be\u000d\u000a      pointed out that de Br&#250;n and Hughes were entered in our Celtic Studies\u000d\u000a      submission for the 2008 RAE when 100% of our output was graded as\u000d\u000a      internationally recognised and 75% was deemed world-leading or\u000d\u000a      internationally excellent.\u000d\u000a    It should also be noted that Hughes' monograph (1998) was listed in the\u000d\u000a      top three British and Irish folklore books for 1998 at a ceremony held in\u000d\u000a      University College London.

In so doing, this\u000d\u000a      research has thrown light on the Presbyterian contribution to the Irish\u000d\u000a      language and afforded a greater understanding of a critical revivalist\u000d\u000a      movement which has tended to be overshadowed by that of the period between\u000d\u000a      the 1880s and 1920s. Hughes' highly-acclaimed monograph (1998) which was\u000d\u000a      listed in the top three British and Irish folklore books in its year of\u000d\u000a      publication, brought to the attention of the public the work of one of\u000d\u000a      Belfast's most distinguished citizens and most successful industrialists,\u000d\u000a      in particular his work in collecting Irish-language manuscripts,\u000d\u000a      Irish-language folklore, Irish songs and proverbs. Hughes' research (1998\u000d\u000a      and 2006; see references below) also demonstrates the importance of the\u000d\u000a      Irish language in trade and communication in this period of great\u000d\u000a      demographic and cultural transformation and provides new insights into the\u000d\u000a      work of nineteenth-century Irish language and literary societies operating\u000d\u000a      in Belfast and throughout Ulster.\u000d\u000a    De Br&#250;n's work on the history of the Irish-speaking community known as\u000d\u000a      the `Fadgies' (see references below) has unearthed a historical profile of\u000d\u000a      one of the communities which contributed to the transformation of Belfast\u000d\u000a      during its most extensive period of demographic expansion. Through\u000d\u000a      examination and synthesis of census material and memoir, this historical\u000d\u000a      profile produced detailed biographical and geographical information\u000d\u000a      revealing a sustained pattern of chain migration and cultural\u000d\u000a      transference. His work on this community has also provided key insights\u000d\u000a      into the intersection of revivalism and native tradition at a critical\u000d\u000a      period for the history of the Irish language.

These\u000d\u000a      poems have been shown by de Br&#250;n to be an essential, if previously\u000d\u000a      ignored, source for the history of the massive social transformation\u000d\u000a      undergone by Belfast in the nineteenth century through industrialization.\u000d\u000a      Mac Domhnaill's story and his poetic testimony on the events of the Great\u000d\u000a      Famine were dramatized for de Br&#250;n's TV documentary (2010).

She is currently working with them on\u000d\u000a      how to improve the educational achievement of working-class youths,\u000d\u000a      especially boys, who are known to be significantly underperforming in the\u000d\u000a      education system. The Academy has recognised the implications of Prof.\u000d\u000a      Henry's research on Belfast English for tackling the stigma attached to\u000d\u000a      the varieties of English used by these youths.

This has led to the\u000d\u000a      development of the \"Ulster Dialects\" website which provides information on\u000d\u000a      local varieties of English, including information and teaching packs to\u000d\u000a      support teachers. This is important in light of the statutory requirements\u000d\u000a      for Language and Literacy in the Northern Ireland Curriculum which include\u000d\u000a      the ability to \"recognise and discuss features of spoken language,\u000d\u000a      including formal and informal language, dialect and colloquial speech\" (http:\/\/www.nicurriculum.org.uk)\u000d\u000a      (Source 7).\u000d\u000a    Henry has also been a frequent guest on local and national radio\u000d\u000a      programmes on topics such as local dialect, `bad' language, and related\u000d\u000a      issues. Most recently she participated in a discussion of whether\u000d\u000a      ministers of religion should use formal standard English or local dialect,\u000d\u000a      including swear words, which generated considerable interest as evidenced\u000d\u000a      by a letter from the programme producer (Source 8). As a result of her\u000d\u000a      public engagement, she also was invited to participate in an Ofcom\u000d\u000a      consultation on the use of local languages in public service broadcasting\u000d\u000a      (2008) (Source 9). Moreoever, those wishing to use and support authentic\u000d\u000a      Belfast English regularly consult Prof. Henry on her research. For\u000d\u000a      example, in October 2011, the singer Van Morrison initiated a meeting with\u000d\u000a      her, through the Chair of the Ullans Academy, to discuss her research, the\u000d\u000a      influence of the Belfast dialect on his song-writing, and his potential\u000d\u000a      contribution to supporting the continued use of the vernacular (Source 5).\u000d\u000a    4.3 Shaping policy and training in Irish immersion education\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Research on the acquisition patterns of Irish in Irish-medium primary\u000d\u000a      schools, funded by DENI, was published in research reports and research\u000d\u000a      summaries circulated widely within the specialism. This research is\u000d\u000a      referenced in the 2009 Joint Policy of the Steering Group on Immersion\u000d\u000a      Education Policy (Source 10 &amp; 12) and was used in the development of\u000d\u000a      an NVQ for early years teachers and other nursery staff, for which Henry\u000d\u000a      acted as an advisor (Source 11 &amp; 12). More recently, a number of\u000d\u000a      invited talks have been delivered under the aegis of UCoM (see below) at\u000d\u000a      conferences run by government bodies supporting Irish-medium education in\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland (Comhairle na Gaelscola&#237;ochta) and the Republic of\u000d\u000a      Ireland (Comhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&#237;ochta). Feedback\u000d\u000a      from these bodies indicated that these talks have been crucial both in\u000d\u000a      supporting the delivery of Irish-medium education and in transforming\u000d\u000a      classroom practice (Source 13 &amp; 14).\u000d\u000a    4.4 Supporting professionals in the transition of Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a          into a multilingual society \u000d\u000a    The linguistics group's research on multilingual acquisition led to the\u000d\u000a      establishment of UCoM (Ulster Centre on Multilingualism), a consultation\u000d\u000a      service for parents, early years practitioners, speech and language\u000d\u000a      therapists and other stakeholders with a role or interest in this area.\u000d\u000a      UCoM services are delivered both in person and through digital\u000d\u000a      communication channels, specifically a website and a Twitter feed (Source\u000d\u000a      15). A particular focus of the website is trilingual acquisition, about\u000d\u000a      which much less information is available and which draws directly on the\u000d\u000a      findings of Project S. The site also features information on sequential\u000d\u000a      bilingualism in education drawn from research on acquisition in immersion\u000d\u000a      settings.\u000d\u000a    Since UCoM's launch, the linguistics team has been invited to give a\u000d\u000a      number of talks and advice to parents, community groups and various\u000d\u000a      professionals. These have included talks to social workers, speech and\u000d\u000a      language therapists, parent and toddler groups, adoptive parents\u000d\u000a      considering adoption of an older child from abroad whose first language is\u000d\u000a      not English, teachers in Irish-medium education and major charities (for a\u000d\u000a      full list of past and future events and initiatives see http:\/\/www.socsci.ulster.ac.uk\/ucom\/events.html).\u000d\u000a      Feedback from these events indicates that they have had a considerable\u000d\u000a      effect in changing both attitudes and practices towards speakers of\u000d\u000a      multiple languages (Source 16). Most notably, in March-June 2013 UCoM\u000d\u000a      collaborated with the charity Barnardo's to establish a programme of\u000d\u000a      linguistic support called Language made fun! for multilingual\u000d\u000a      children of refugees and asylum seekers in Northern Ireland. The programme\u000d\u000a      is underpinned by the insights into the relationship between community and\u000d\u000a      family languages that have emerged from Project S (Source 17).\u000d\u000a    In summary, this case study shows how the work of linguistics at\u000d\u000a        Ulster is transforming attitudes and practices relating to language and\u000d\u000a        the status of dialect among relevant professionals. It also importantly\u000d\u000a        empowers local multilingual families in their institutional\u000d\u000a        interactions.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Linguistics at Ulster has:\u000d\u000a    1) influenced public policy and provision for Ulster Scots through\u000d\u000a      appointment to The Ulster Scots Academy Implementation Group, planning for\u000d\u000a      an Ulster Scots Academy and publication of Ulster Scots language resources\u000d\u000a    2) impacted on public values and discourse relating to local dialects\u000d\u000a      with consequent effects on educational participation and practice\u000d\u000a    3) underpinned developments in policy and training in Irish-medium\u000d\u000a      education\u000d\u000a    4) transformed the perspectives of communities and professionals adapting\u000d\u000a      to the transition of Northern Ireland to a multicultural, multilingual\u000d\u000a      society.\u000d\u000a    Effectively it has changed how relevant stakeholders engage with issues\u000d\u000a      relating to language, linguistic prejudices and disadvantage.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Ulster\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Ulster (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Ulster","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Northern Ireland","UKPRN":10007807}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"7521316","Name":"Ulster"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    All research outputs in the case study have been published in reputable\u000d\u000a      outlets, including publishers such as OUP and journals such as English\u000d\u000a        Language and Linguistics.\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Henry, A (1995) Belfast English and Standard English: dialect\u000d\u000a        variation and parameter setting.

Its impact is underpinned by three main strands of research\u000d\u000a      which together address core questions on the nature of linguistic\u000d\u000a      diversity and multiple grammatical systems. These theoretical questions\u000d\u000a      are shown through this case study to impact on vital social issues such as\u000d\u000a      educational and social disadvantage for speakers of local varieties and\u000d\u000a      multiple languages. Aspects of this research were variously funded by 1) a\u000d\u000a      grant of &#163;104,050.00 from the ESRC (1995-1998), 2) a grant of &#163;15,000.00\u000d\u000a      from the Department of Education for Northern Ireland (1996-1998) and 3) a\u000d\u000a      grant of &#163;16,666.00 from the European Commission Directorate on Education\u000d\u000a      (CEC-DG-XXII Minority Languages) (1998-1999). The key researchers on this\u000d\u000a      impact were: Alison Henry, Professor of Linguistics, University of Ulster\u000d\u000a      (1981-present); Raffaella Folli, Senior Lecturer, University of Ulster\u000d\u000a      (2005-present); Christina Sevdali, Lecturer, University of Ulster\u000d\u000a      (2009-present).\u000d\u000a    One focus of research in linguistics at Ulster has been on language\u000d\u000a      structure and use in the local context. Prof. Alison Henry has undertaken\u000d\u000a      extensive research on the structure of Belfast English and other local\u000d\u000a      varieties. In particular, Henry (1995) presents the first serious study of\u000d\u000a      Belfast English. This work, apart from its contribution to linguistic\u000d\u000a      theory, confirms that local varieties are as much rule-governed as\u000d\u000a      standard varieties and that their status should be the same as that of\u000d\u000a      standard varieties. A particular consequence of this result is that the\u000d\u000a      users of local varieties should not be discriminated against in education,\u000d\u000a      employment and other areas.\u000d\u000a    A second area of research has been the acquisition of Irish in\u000d\u000a      Irish-medium schools (Henry &amp; Tangney 2001; Henry et al. 2002). This\u000d\u000a      has shown that although at certain stages the Irish developed by children\u000d\u000a      in the immersion situation manifests some errors compared to textbook\u000d\u000a      Irish, it is similar to native-speaker Irish, maturing into a mostly\u000d\u000a      native-like variety. Our research thus directly addresses a recurring\u000d\u000a      criticism that children in Irish-medium schools develop a heavily\u000d\u000a      Anglicised `pidgin' Irish in terms of morphosyntax.\u000d\u000a    Finally, Folli, Henry and Sevdali have led a three-year longitudinal\u000d\u000a      study of multilingual acquisition (Devlin et al. 2012, 2013). Besides\u000d\u000a      publications, this project has produced an invaluable resource in the form\u000d\u000a      of a corpus of data, now available on the CHILDES database, collected from\u000d\u000a      a trilingual child learning Italian, Scottish Gaelic and English. This\u000d\u000a      study has shown that multilingual acquisition exhibits some features of\u000d\u000a      language transfer. However, contrary to standard assumptions, the impact\u000d\u000a      is not straightforwardly in the direction of the stronger language\u000d\u000a      affecting the weaker language(s). This naturally leads to a\u000d\u000a      reconsideration of traditional views on the relationships between\u000d\u000a      languages in the multilingual mind.

The work\u000d\u000a      of researchers at Ulster has been key in assessing and evaluating the\u000d\u000a      impact of this technology on the language learning process and in\u000d\u000a      establishing guidelines and examples of effective practice for its\u000d\u000a      adoption. The investigation by Gillespie &amp; Barr (2002) into HE staff\u000d\u000a      attitudes towards the use of ICT suggested that most of them are pragmatic\u000d\u000a      adopters of technology; in other words, they will use the technology when\u000d\u000a      it makes a difference to their teaching. A wider view of this suggests\u000d\u000a      that if new technologies are to be adopted effectively, training in their\u000d\u000a      use is key as it will provide valuable insights into how to use the\u000d\u000a      technology appropriately.\u000d\u000a    To build on this principle, Barr (2004) established a model for\u000d\u000a      institutions interested in integrating computer technology in their\u000d\u000a      language learning environment. That work established a series of\u000d\u000a      recommendations for embedding technology and these have been adopted by a\u000d\u000a      variety of HEIs, including Aston University and the University of Toronto.\u000d\u000a    In view of continual changes in the use of technology, more recent\u000d\u000a      research by staff at Ulster has been undertaken to test the principles\u000d\u000a      previously established.

Context\u000a    The spin out of Articulate Instruments Ltd. from QMU in September 2003\u000a      was an impact-oriented strategic move to facilitate the eventual uptake of\u000a      EPG in healthcare. The insight was that independence from QMU as an HEI\u000a      was necessary to obtain and retain \"CE marking\" of products (especially\u000a      EPG). Without CE marking, EPG cannot be sold, used or supported as a\u000a      clinical device in the European Union, i.e. for non-research, clinical\u000a      diagnosis and therapy in the NHS. Long term, impact requires that EPG is\u000a      not just be a research tool but a certified medical device. CE marking was\u000a      obtained in 2004. Prior to this process, sales of EPG were only for\u000a      research purposes (albeit including clinical research), not clinical\u000a      treatment, which had precluded many routes to impact. The main evidence\u000a      for impact, along with levels of uptake of products in the census period\u000a      clinically and internationally, is the ongoing financial health of the\u000a      spin-out company.\u000a    2. Baseline figures\u000a    EPG is a well-known technology in academic phonetics. It has existed in a\u000a      number of formats for several decades. Older sales figures of our unique\u000a      systems will give some baseline context to current impact. The older\u000a      system EPG2 (1983-1992) gave rise to the sale of 72 systems (17 to\u000a      hospitals and clinics for clinical linguistic research). EPG3 (1993-1998)\u000a      had 52 sales (12 to hospitals etc. for clinical research). From 1998-2003,\u000a      just 23 EPG3 were sold. The Personal Training Unit (PTU) was a standalone\u000a      product aimed at therapy use, of which around 30 were sold in the UK and\u000a      Ireland from its launch in 1998 till 2003. These sales covered basic costs\u000a      and were handled from Reading University, then QMU.\u000a    Articulate Instruments took over in 2003. From 2003-2008 there were 126\u000a      customers, 46 (37%) in the UK. Thirty of these were non-academic: 21 in\u000a      the UK, 9 in Europe and Canada. Turnover was approximately &#163;130k per year.\u000a      Initially, most customers were buying EPG systems but from 2008 onwards\u000a      UTI (Ultrasound Tongue Imaging) products have been added and sales have\u000a      increased. An increased level of sales was seen when Articulate\u000a      Instruments Ltd. was formed. This enhanced level of impact has been\u000a      sustained over the census period with further new products added.\u000a    Some products, mainly the new EPG \"Articulate\" palate (see below), were\u000a      designed by WRENCH alone. EPG palates exist in tandem with EPG analysis\u000a      systems. We will note EPG palate sales separately below, which are largely\u000a      of value to other companies. The new palate sales are an impact of\u000a      underpinning QMU research into EPG systems and of WRENCH's palate\u000a      research.\u000a    Number and Distribution of Sales, Turnover, and Profitability\u000a        2008-2013\u000a    Figures are from audited accounts and internal financial returns of the\u000a      company.

Effect on the UK economy via expenditure\u000a    The company's receipts have supported WRENCH since 2003 and through the\u000a      impact census period (i.e. he received no salary from QMU). The company\u000a      also supports SMEs through contracts to supply parts and services. This\u000a      flow-through to the wider economy differentially favours high-technology\u000a      SMEs, such as a local Musselburgh company ZOT, and freelance software\u000a      programmers. The customisable ultrasonic system underlying the high-speed\u000a      system is manufactured by Ultrasonix from Vancouver, Canada. Thus, the\u000a      main related businesses are:\u000a    \u000a      ZOT for circuit boards, electronics and containment boxes for EPG.\u000a      ZOT for shaped and prepared aluminium components for UTI headset.\u000a      Local freelance software programmer.\u000a      EPG palate manufacturers, supported directly by their own customers.\u000a    \u000a    5. EPG palates\u000a    These are a necessary part of EPG use &#8212; they are custom-built from a\u000a      personal palate mould and are unique for each speaker using EPG. In\u000a      addition to the traditional \"Reading\" palate, designed at Reading\u000a      University, there is a new \"Articulate\" design arising from research by\u000a      WRENCH. We could cite sales of all palates for use with EPG as part of the\u000a      financial impact, since the underpinning research was into a new\u000a      generation of EPG, and all EPG use requires palates of one type or the\u000a      other. From 2008-2013, most were manufactured in Frenchay Hospital,\u000a      Bristol, by Incidental, Reading, or by individual hospitals or dental\u000a      clinics, e.g. in Sweden or Japan. We estimate that over 80 of the Reading\u000a      palates were made during the census period annually, at ~&#163;400 each (~&#163;200k\u000a      total). Since the 2007 launch, 85 new Articulate palates have been made\u000a      (~&#163;34k). These figures are additional to the company turnover &#8212; customers\u000a      get palates made by a local dentist and purchase them direct from one of\u000a      the dental technician companies mentioned or use their own staff time to\u000a      manufacture them. Articulate Instruments Ltd. merely supplies printed\u000a      circuits for the Articulate palate (~&#163;8k income in total, included above).\u000a    6. Synergistic research\/impact activity, clinical activity\u000a    The company has contributed in financial terms (&#163;20k) and in staff-time\u000a      (approx. 3 months) as formal contributions to the ULTRAX EPSRC-funded\u000a      project. The company has also contributed time and resources to\u000a      implementing alterations to its software to reflect the developing\u000a      research needs of its beta-testers in CASL Research Centre. The\u000a      commissioned work for the ESPF dual-EMA facility contributed an EMA\u000a      module to the AAA software and synchronisation components. Articulate\u000a      Instruments and CASL collaborate both for research purposes and to achieve\u000a      impact. The latter is facilitated by and embodied in activities such as\u000a      clinician workshops, beta-testing, consultancy, physical collocation,\u000a      seminars, technical support and applied research.\u000a    We secured funding as part of ULTRAX and a QMU PhD bursary to do clinical\u000a      UTI research. Eight children were treated in the census period, providing\u000a      invaluable applied research experience, case data for clinician workshops,\u000a      and ideas for clinically-relevant improvements to AAA. Results were\u000a      positive: Parent A said of her son's treatment: \"using the\u000a        visual seemed to help [him] position his tongue.\" Parent B said: \"I\u000a        was initially sceptical &#8212; especially when I saw the helmet! His\u000a        confidence has increased and he is now able to communicate clearly,\u000a        without anxiety.\"\u000a    7. Leadership and expansion of use of UTI\u000a    UTI was used by around a half-dozen laboratories across the world in\u000a      2001. QMU and Articulate Instruments have been involved in this community\u000a      since the 2nd by-invitation-only international Ultrafest at\u000a      UBC, Vancouver (2004). We know of no laboratories in the UK or Europe\u000a      using UTI before QMU. The combination of underpinning research, falling\u000a      costs and the promise of consistent reliable support from a specialist\u000a      software\/hardware company has helped in the expansion of UTI. We believe\u000a      critical elements in this expansion are the leadership, commercial\u000a      independence, longevity, and specialist support offered by Articulate\u000a      Instruments Ltd. The company announced in 2012 that it would co-organise\u000a      Ultrafest VI in Edinburgh and attracted 88 non-QMU registrations. An\u000a      associated clinical workshop attracted 17 registrations. In the UK,\u000a      video-UTI equipment with AAA is now being used in universities in Glasgow,\u000a      Manchester and Newcastle. AAA software is available in Edinburgh, London,\u000a      Aberdeen and Strathclyde. High-speed Ultrasonix systems, with associated\u000a      AAA hardware and software, have been ordered or purchased by universities\u000a      in Germany, Brazil, England and Italy, with more hardware in the USA. Of\u000a      the 50 phonetic laboratories we know of worldwide in 2013 using UTI, 25\u000a      are using Articulate Instruments hardware and software. Even more\u000a      institutions - 39 - use the headset.\u000a    Company A states that QMU's ultrasound research in collaboration with\u000a      Articulate Instruments Ltd \"has been commercially useful for our\u000a          company ... The phonetic research done at QMU has solved\u000a        problems with acoustic synchronization and demonstrates the benefits of\u000a        high speed ultrasound for linguistic analysis. Our first sale\u000a          for phonetics research was to QMU, but we have now sold 7 systems\u000a      of that type of scanner to phonetics research labs in Europe, the UK,\u000a        and North America, who are following their lead.\u000a        We look forward to continuing our partnership with QMU and expanding our\u000a        portfolio into this unique research area.\" (our emphasis, quoted\u000a      from a letter on file at QMU, cf. the private list of named\u000a      corroborators.)\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Articulate Instruments Ltd. was founded in 2003 as a research, design,\u000a      manufacturing and consulting company for users of phonetic\u000a      instrumentation.

Over two\u000a      decades, we have researched novel and unique combinations of phonetic\u000a      instrumentation and methodology for both clinical and non-clinical topics.\u000a      There has been a focus on enhancing reliability, usability and\u000a      flexibility, with a view that its use should be extended to non-academic\u000a      users, particularly in clinical contexts. Below, names that are\u000a    CAPITALISED indicate staff with outputs included in this REF UOA.\u000a    \u000a      WRENCH spent two years developing a MS-Windows version of\u000a        Electropalatography (EPG) at QMU (2001-2003) then left to set up\u000a        Articulate Instruments Ltd in September 2003 as a spin-out company.\u000a        This was part of QMU's strategy to ensure the long term viability of EPG\u000a        as a \"clinical device\" (see below). He had been a post-doctoral\u000a        researcher at QMU from 1995 to 2003 on the QMU\/Edinburgh University\u000a        Speech Production Facility (ESPF) and other clinically-oriented speech\u000a        technology projects. Strategic internal funding (1996-1997) and the\u000a        EPSRC-funded project on speech recognition using articulatory data\u000a        (1998-2001) were used to research and develop implementations of EPG in\u000a        MS-Windows, replacing the obsolescent DOS-Windows version. EPG became\u000a        the core of both a clinical system (Articulate Assistant) and then a\u000a        multi-channel research system (Articulate Assistant Advanced, \"AAA\").\u000a        The company has been an independent entity, with WRENCH as its sole\u000a        direct employee\/director since 2003. However, close ties have been\u000a        retained with QMU through collaborative research and shared strategic\u000a        goals with the former Speech Science Research Centre (SSRC), now\u000a        Clinical Audiology, Speech and Language Research Centre (CASL,\u000a        2011-2013).\u000a      Professor Bill Hardcastle was appointed by QMU (1990-2009). This\u000a        initiated more than 20 years of continuous research and development into\u000a        articulatory instrumentation. From 1996, Hardcastle secured the funding\u000a        to develop the MS-Windows version of EPG . His work with Dr Steve Isard\u000a        of the Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR) at the University of\u000a        Edinburgh, on a Carsten's EMA AG-100 system, formed the heart of an\u000a        integrated EPG-EMA system, producing the Mocha-TIMIT corpus which\u000a        underpins impact in speech technology.\u000a      Dr Nigel Hewlett (retired 2010, with a further period of ESRC-funded\u000a        research 2012-2013) initiated ultrasound-based articulatory research in\u000a        2001. QMU-internal SRIF-funding let us research ultrasound data capture\u000a        and analysis, probe stabilisation and integration with EPG.\u000a      SCOBBIE secured more SRIF-funding (2005) to commission a high-speed\u000a        system from Articulate Instruments Ltd, based around Ultrasonix\u000a        hardware. The resulting two ultrasound tongue imaging \"UTI\" systems work\u000a        on entirely different principles. The video system is conventional while\u000a        the Ultrasonix is a high-speed system incorporating a number of\u000a        innovations: audio-visual synchronisation hardware at its core, storage\u000a        of raw scan data (one scan\/frame), compatibility with EPG and video\u000a        camera input (eg for lip analysis). SCOBBIE's joint research with Wrench\u000a        is cited here as underpinning research in terms of impact.\u000a      An EPSRC grant, in collaboration with Professor Alice Turk (Edinburgh)\u000a        and Professor Steve Renals (CSTR) with SCOBBIE and LICKLEY, recently set\u000a        up the world's first dual-EMA system based on Carstens AG-500, also\u000a        combining it with EPG. QMU commissioned an EMA-analysis module to\u000a        integrate into AAA software from Articulate Instruments Ltd.\u000a      QMU staff (SCOBBIE, LICKLEY) and post-doctoral fellows and PIs\u000a        (LAWSON, ZHARKOVA, CLELAND, S.SCHAEFFLER) have continued to secure\u000a        funding to undertake basic and applied articulatory research, resulting\u000a        in continuing research and development of the uses of the AAA\u000a        multi-channel modular system. This methodological, descriptive and\u000a        theoretical linguistic research is disseminated to academic audiences,\u000a        with elements being exploited by Articulate Instruments Ltd. to improve\u000a        software and generate financial impact. During the more recent\u000a        development of these technologies, QMU staff have identified linguistic\u000a        research goals and contributed to developments in areas such as spine\u000a        averaging, headsets, clinical support functions and image processing (in\u000a        addition to numerous external innovations by the company itself which\u000a        are not being cited here as underpinning research).\u000a      In 2012, as part of ULTRAX (EPSRC-funded project to SCOBBIE and\u000a        CLELAND, and Renals and Richmond at CSTR) MRI image analysis was\u000a        included within AAA as an add-on module.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1698","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impacts are in healthcare, public awareness, and quality of life.

A CSMEN award (&#163;5k) was made during the\u000a        census period to support WOOD to train therapists in EPG and to support\u000a        a small clinical caseload of 3 children in Edinburgh, East Lothian and\u000a        West Lothian. The actual intervention started after 31 July, so is\u000a        detailed in our impact template as future activity. The Clinical Lead\u000a        Community Services will corroborate the need for such treatment and\u000a        associated training for NHS staff.\u000a      EPG workshops (QMU). Whole day workshops (2010, 2011, 2012) have\u000a        attracted around 20 clinicians. (The 2013 workshop is a UTI workshop,\u000a        associated with Ultrafest VI.)\u000a      EPG workshops (elsewhere). Workshops for clinicians have been\u000a        run at other locations when QMU staff have been invited and funded to\u000a        attend. This shows an on-going demand from professional organisations\u000a        for training and discussion of clinicians. Notable events:\u000a      \u000a        2008 Stockholm, Sweden, EPG workshop (WRENCH, CLELAND);\u000a        2009 Salzburg, Austria, EPG workshop (WRENCH);\u000a        2012 Osaka, Japan, EPG symposium (WRENCH);\u000a        2012 London, England, ASLTIP (Association of SLTs in Independent\u000a          Practice) EPG &amp; Ultrasound workshop (WRENCH, CLELAND);\u000a        2013 Link&#246;ping, Sweden, EPG workshop (WRENCH).\u000a      \u000a      3. NHS trials\u000a        Though EPG is not routinely available, small-scale implementations of\u000a        therapy associated with research in particular caseloads typically show\u000a        improvements to speech.\u000a      4. Cleftnet UK\u000a        Prior to her departure in 2009, Gibbon coordinated a network of all 14\u000a        NHS cleft-palate centres in the UK, offering EPG in all locations to a\u000a        small trial caseload.\u000a      5. Cornwall trial\u000a        There was a pre-RCT trial in Cornwall (2011-2013) of EPG therapy for\u000a        children with severe and profound hearing impairment. It was supported\u000a        by a Research for Patient Benefit grant (&#163;250k) from the National\u000a        Institute of Health Research. Again, this was a mixed research\/impact\u000a        activity, providing EPG therapy and evaluating the feasibility of a full\u000a        RCT leading to improvements to delivery in non-academic contexts.\u000a        Improvements in children's speech performance were observed and\u000a        reported, providing evidence of impact.\u000a      6. Testimonials and public awareness via press coverage following EPG\u000a          therapy\u000a      Client A. EPG therapy (and latterly some that was\u000a        ultrasound-based) was given to a 10-year-old girl fitted in infancy with\u000a        a cochlear implant, who had been referred by a CASL audiologist (White).\u000a        Aged 15, A was keen for her testimonial to be featured in the press and\u000a        in other publicity, because, in her words: \"The EPG helped me relearn\u000a          how to speak. I didn't realise what I was doing wrong before but\u000a          seeing the shapes my tongue made on a computer screen made it easy for\u000a          me to learn how to change my words. People understand me so much\u000a          better now and I don't have to repeat what I say nearly so much. And\u000a          having better speech gave me the confidence to be a speaker at a\u000a          conference for parents of deaf babies. I wanted to show how well their\u000a          children could do when they grow up. Lots of the mums and dads were so\u000a          moved they cried - even my mum.\" The article concludes that Client\u000a        A: \"now wants more deaf people to benefit from the same techniques\u000a          that helped her. \"I'm the only one of all my deaf friends who has had\u000a          EPG and that's not fair. Everyone should have an equal chance to\u000a          improve their speech,\" she said.\" (14\/05\/11)\u000a      Clients B and C, Parent, Classroom Assistant. After 3 months of\u000a        the Nuffield project, a classroom assistant said: \"It's been very\u000a          positive... [B, age 11] knows exactly how to produce sounds because\u000a          she's seeing them on a screen and she really enjoys using the palate.\"\u000a          \"[C]... was also benefitting from the trial, with nine-year-old [X]\u000a          also set to get on board.\" Additionally, B's mother said: \"I\u000a          think EPG has made her think about the sounds she's producing much\u000a          more. The screen makes it easier to imagine the sounds and picture\u000a          them, and I think the whole experience has just given her more\u000a          confidence.\" (09\/04\/13) (See also press coverage 05\/02\/13,\u000a        05\/02\/13.)\u000a      Client D. D (aged 8) was selected to meet H.M. the Queen when\u000a        she opened QMU's new campus in 2008. In April 2012, she voluntarily\u000a        contacted the BBC in response to a call for stories to illustrate\u000a        \"meeting the Queen\" as part of the Diamond Jubilee. In 2012, aged 12,\u000a        she reminisced:\u000a        \"The Queen watched me doing speech therapy. She was in a room next\u000a          door, looking through a window. I was using an electronic palate,\u000a          which showed different patterns on the screen when I made different\u000a          sounds. I met the Queen afterwards. I was excited, because she's a\u000a          character in one of my favourite books - The BFG by Roald Dahl. I told\u000a          my mum I would say 'Hello, your Majister', like the BFG, but my mum\u000a          said I shouldn't. So I just said, 'Hello, Your Majesty'. The Queen\u000a          asked me if I found it interesting working with the electronic palate.\u000a          I said 'Yes, I did, your Majesty'.\" (03\/06\/2012)\u000a      7. Un-met demand for EPG therapy from clinician workshops,\u000a          self-referrals, etc.\u000a        The local model of integrating EPG into available care pathways, devised\u000a        in collaboration with local SLT services, concentrates on clinical\u000a        activity being targeted towards specific client groups, in small,\u000a        manageable cohorts. We therefore discourage unsolicited referrals to QMU\u000a        for EPG therapy. Even so, from 2008-2012 WOOD's records confirm we\u000a        received 15 enquiries for therapy coming from word-of-mouth contacts of\u000a        research participants. Following the February 2013 press stories about\u000a        EPG, WOOD received 12 requests for therapy from clinicians and the\u000a        general public. In association with calls for participants in\u000a        therapeutic case studies, we receive many more referrals than we can\u000a        satisfy. A brief 2008 call to SLTs for 2 cases to be the basis of a book\u000a        chapter illustrating the methods and results of EPG therapy (Gibbon and\u000a        WOOD, 2010) quickly drew 6 referrals. The CSMEN award (2013) to treat 3\u000a        children attracted 24 new referrals from local SLTs. After EPG workshops\u000a        for about 6 SLTs, we predict a dozen or so referrals. As we\u000a        unfortunately lack the resources and mandate to provide a therapeutic\u000a        pathway of care and EPG is not yet available on the NHS, we have been\u000a        careful not to create unmet demand. Nevertheless, the amount of pent-up\u000a        demand revealed by spontaneous enquiries demonstrates impact in a way\u000a        that also illustrates some of the ethical difficulties in aiming for\u000a        impact in the first place.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact is primarily in Public Health. It mainly concerns the adoption\u000a      of and demand for a speech research technology, Electropalatography (EPG),\u000a      for clinical diagnosis and treatment of speech disorders. Our continuing\u000a      long-term and interdisciplinary research into EPG has increased our impact\u000a      in this census period from the previous RAE2008, during which time the UOA\u000a      had already been awarded a Queen's Anniversary Prize (2002) for working\u000a      towards the clinical application of speech science.\u000a    Financial Support from the charitable sector and the NHS for the training\u000a      of classroom assistants and SLTs in EPG therapy is highlighted, along with\u000a      user testimonials, unmet demand, and small-scale provision of the therapy.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Queen Margaret University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen Margaret University Edinburgh","InstitutionName":"Queen Margaret University Edinburgh","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10005337}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2650225","Name":"Edinburgh"},{"GeoNamesId":"2694762","Name":"Linkoping"},{"GeoNamesId":"1853909","Name":"Osaka-shi"},{"GeoNamesId":"2766824","Name":"Salzburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2673730","Name":"Stockholm"}],"References":"\u000a    We highlight here research into normative patterns, pathological patterns\u000a      and clinical protocols.

Here we focus on\u000a      the phonetic, linguistic and clinically oriented research that underpins\u000a      this case. CAPITALISED names are of individuals contributing outputs to\u000a      this UOA in this REF, and other researchers named in this section were QMU\u000a      staff (or RAs) at the time of producing the underpinning research.\u000a    QMU lecturing staff and researchers have undertaken research into EPG\u000a      over two decades, since the appointment of Hardcastle (1991-2009) and\u000a      Gibbon (1992-2009). Both led the strategic development of the therapeutic\u000a      use of EPG, usually in a medical research context. It was decided to spin\u000a      out Articulate Instruments Ltd. (in September 2003) from QMU to enable it\u000a      to obtain a CE mark certification for non-research use of EPG as a\u000a      clinical healthcare tool. CE marking of EPG for clinical (e.g. NHS) use\u000a      was achieved by Articulate Instruments Ltd. in 2004, meeting stringent\u000a      safety and quality-insurance regimes required by legislation. This was a\u000a      crucial element in promoting the impactful use of EPG in the UK and EU\u000a      that had previously been missing. This process also enabled Articulate\u000a      Instruments Ltd. to exploit the freedom and flexibility of the commercial\u000a      sector to tailor underpinning research to the needs of non-academic users.\u000a      Nevertheless, a strategic synergy has been maintained between QMU and\u000a      Articulate Instruments Ltd., and collaboration for research and impact\u000a      have continued and prospered under WOOD.\u000a    The underpinning research is mainly applied or clinically related.\u000a      Funding has been obtained through strategic internal investment and\u000a      peer-reviewed competitive external grants. The latter clearly provides\u000a      evidence of its quality, as does the selection of peer-reviewed outputs\u000a      below.\u000a    The themes of the underpinning research highlighted in this case address\u000a      the following questions:\u000a    \u000a      How best can EPG be used in a clinical domain as a diagnostic and\u000a        therapeutic tool, with what client groups and with what models of\u000a        intervention? (Gibbon, WOOD, CLELAND);\u000a      What articulatory patterns, analysis variables, statistical\u000a        comparisons and other phonetic characteristics of clinical speech are\u000a        characteristic of disordered speech before, during, and after treatment?\u000a        (Gibbon, WOOD, Timmins, Hardcastle);\u000a      Does EPG therapy improve the speech of children with speech disorders\u000a        resulting from Down's Syndrome? (WOOD, CLELAND, Gibbon);\u000a      Does EPG therapy improve the speech of children with speech disorders\u000a        resulting from Cleft Palate? (Gibbon, Roxburgh);\u000a      What are normal speech production patterns? (SCOBBIE, S.SCHAEFFLER,\u000a        ZHARKOVA);\u000a      What are the psycholinguistic processes underlying real time visual\u000a        biofeedback, and how best should the feedback be presented by software?\u000a        (CLELAND, SCOBBIE, WRENCH).\u000a    \u000a    It is important to note that the underpinning research has a long time\u000a      base. It involves a broad set of QMU-based researchers and employs a\u000a      variety of research methods, from electronic and software engineering,\u000a      phonetics, laboratory phonology, psycholinguistics, speech technology,\u000a      clinical linguistics. It addresses theoretical linguistic questions as\u000a      well as clinical and methodological topics, and targets an increasing\u000a      range of caseloads.\u000a    An MRC research project showed EPG could significantly improve the speech\u000a      clarity of children and young people with Down's syndrome. The\u000a      underpinning research by WRENCH prior to his departure from QMU to set up\u000a      Articulate Instruments Ltd. in 2003 was to:\u000a    a. Develop an MS-Windows version of EPG, with a software environment\u000a      called Articulate Assistant (AA) that enables the capture, storage, and\u000a      analysis of client data with synchronised audio and articulatory patterns\u000a      (at 200Hz). The software provides side-by-side therapist\/client real time\u000a      visual biofeedback and models of correct productions;\u000a    b. Develop a different, extendable, multi-channel EPG system (\"AAA\")\u000a      which can be augmented with modules for other articulatory instruments.\u000a      (Initially this was EMA, but later developments include video-based\u000a      Ultrasound Tongue Imaging and high-speed Ultrasound Tongue Imaging, both\u000a      of which are beginning to be applied in a clinical domain).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2734","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"718075","Name":"Macedonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"831053","Name":"Kosovo"},{"GeoNamesId":"783754","Name":"Albania"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Macedonia has faced high levels of community conflict and tension in\u000d\u000a      recent years, bordered as it is by Kosovo and Albania with a large\u000d\u000a      Albanian population living within its borders.

Since then, thousands of copies of the Guidebook have been\u000d\u000a      disseminated among language teachers throughout Macedonia, in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with the regional offices of the Bureau of Education and\u000d\u000a      Development.\u000d\u000a    Between August and December 2011, 444 language teachers from 37 primary\u000d\u000a      and 17 secondary schools from 3 different cities (Skopje, Tetovo and\u000d\u000a      Kumanovo) were trained using the teacher training programme on grammar\u000d\u000a      teaching and the Guidebook. Twenty-eight training sessions were delivered\u000d\u000a      in two languages (Macedonian and Albanian). Teachers of other foreign\u000d\u000a      languages (English, German and French) benefited from the training as well\u000d\u000a      as those teaching Macedonian and community languages. Responses and\u000d\u000a      comments received from the training were positive and encouraging. The\u000d\u000a      feedback confirmed that the training was well-designed and provided\u000d\u000a      important insights into language curriculum development. It enhanced\u000d\u000a      teachers' knowledge and ability to develop effective grammar tasks and to\u000d\u000a      deliver them in the language classroom. The plan is to cascade the\u000d\u000a      training to all schools in the country and to develop further training\u000d\u000a      modules, for instance on the best way to give feedback to students.\u000d\u000a    An additional value of the project is the knowledge sharing and\u000d\u000a      cooperation between institutions that previously worked in isolation from\u000d\u000a      each other. As a result of the success of the project, state advisors from\u000d\u000a      the Bureau of Education Development are cooperating with state and private\u000d\u000a      university professors in adopting a new strategy to develop effective\u000d\u000a      policies and methodologies in teaching a second language in Macedonia.

Professor Benati was one of a small international\u000d\u000a      team who started the theoretical framework on this field of Second\u000d\u000a      Language Acquisition in the mid-1990s. Input Processing argues that second\u000d\u000a      language learners will process information available to them from the\u000d\u000a      language's surface structure more effectively if their attention can be\u000d\u000a      drawn to those items of the language which carry grammatical significance.\u000d\u000a      The normal tendency of learners is to pay attention to lexical items as\u000d\u000a      they carry most meaning but in order to learn the syntax, ways must be\u000d\u000a      found of making the grammatical items more salient for them. Learners can\u000d\u000a      be taught to note the grammar, often without resorting to conscious\u000d\u000a      knowledge; input processing studies demonstrate how. Processing\u000d\u000a      Instruction looks at ways in which materials can be presented to learners\u000d\u000a      so that Input Processing happens in the most successful way possible\u000d\u000a      through input enhancement.\u000d\u000a    The key research underpinning Professor Benati's understanding of Input\u000d\u000a      Processing and Processing Instruction was carried out between 2001 to\u000d\u000a      2007, during which time he investigated the effects of Processing\u000d\u000a      Instruction under a variety of conditions, teasing out variables and\u000d\u000a      testing the relative effects of this psycholinguistic approach to grammar\u000d\u000a      instruction [3.1]. The main variables were the taught language: English,\u000d\u000a      Japanese, Italian etc; different forms like gender and tense, and\u000d\u000a      syntactic structures like word order; and then the different\u000d\u000a      learners and their mother tongues. Of particular interest to the\u000d\u000a      Macedonian project was how technology could best be utilised within this\u000d\u000a      learning and teaching methodology. This was the focus of Professor\u000d\u000a      Benati's 2007 book Delivering Processing Instruction in Classroom and\u000d\u000a        Virtual Contexts. It examines empirically the differential effects\u000d\u000a      of delivering Processing Instruction by instructors in classrooms compared\u000d\u000a      with students working individually with computers.\u000d\u000a    The period 2008-2013 examined further aspects of Processing Instruction.\u000d\u000a      The 2008 monograph [3.2.2] demonstrated how training on one particular\u000d\u000a      grammatical feature impacts on the acquisition of other features affected\u000d\u000a      by a similar processing problem. The 2010 book [3.3.2] examined the impact\u000d\u000a      of learning through discourse or conversation as opposed to closed\u000d\u000a      sentences, again on the basis of a number of classroom-based empirical\u000d\u000a      studies. The 2013 book [3.3.3] examines the interplay between individual\u000d\u000a      differences such as age, working memory and aptitude, and Processing\u000d\u000a      Instruction. Other monographs relate research findings to their classroom\u000d\u000a      applications in different contexts eg Japanese Language Teaching\u000d\u000a        (2009) [3.3.1]. Overall, this research indicated the\u000d\u000a      importance of manipulating input to provide a focus on grammatical\u000d\u000a      features. Grammar tasks should be designed to ensure that learners process\u000d\u000a      input correctly and efficiently by noticing and processing forms in the\u000d\u000a      input, eventually making correct connections between a grammatical form\u000d\u000a      and its meaning.\u000d\u000a    Professor Benati has also undertaken research to make theory and research\u000d\u000a      accessible to non- specialists, and to identify the links between theory\u000d\u000a      and practice in second language learning and teaching, and links between\u000d\u000a      research findings and their classroom implications and applications. He\u000d\u000a      has published a further three monographs to address these issues for the\u000d\u000a      benefit of teachers and practitioners.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2810","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Like spoken languages, sign languages can become endangered and extinct\u000d\u000a      due to several factors\u000d\u000a      such as language contact and lack of recognition. The endangerment of sign\u000d\u000a      languages, previously\u000d\u000a      largely ignored, has been brought to the forefront of attention through\u000d\u000a      work at iSLanDS.\u000d\u000a    The EuroBABEL project \"Endangered sign languages in village communities\"\u000d\u000a      (2008-2013) has led\u000d\u000a      to engagement with international bodies at the highest levels. In June\u000d\u000a      2011, the project led to PI\u000d\u000a      Zeshan being invited to join a meeting of experts on language endangerment\u000d\u000a      hosted at UNESCO\u000d\u000a      in Paris. The expert group had been working since 2003 and had produced\u000d\u000a      the important Atlas of\u000d\u000a        the World's Languages in Danger (in print and as a web database).\u000d\u000a      However, no sign languages\u000d\u000a      were represented, and most members of the expert group were not aware of\u000d\u000a      sign languages also\u000d\u000a      being endangered. After Zeshan gave a plenary presentation on sign\u000d\u000a      language endangerment at\u000d\u000a      UNESCO, it was decided to include sign languages in the online database\u000d\u000a      and the next print\u000d\u000a      edition with a dedicated chapter, to be authored by Zeshan. Consultancy on\u000d\u000a      endangered sign\u000d\u000a      languages for UNESCO is channelled through the Foundation for Endangered\u000d\u000a      Languages (FEL),\u000d\u000a      and the first data sets have been submitted for inclusion in the online\u000d\u000a      version of the Atlas. This\u000d\u000a      activity has since expanded to include urban sign languages, some of which\u000d\u000a      are becoming\u000d\u000a      endangered too. Through the international committee coordinated by\u000d\u000a      iSLanDS, an increasing\u000d\u000a      number of concerned sign linguistics and deaf organisations have been in\u000d\u000a      contact to provide data\u000d\u000a      for inclusion in the Atlas. The committee ensures the academic\u000d\u000a      rigour of these data and their\u000d\u000a      classification into categories of increasing endangerment, as inclusion in\u000d\u000a      this project under a\u000d\u000a      UNESCO umbrella can be a very valuable campaigning and lobbying tool for\u000d\u000a      concerned deaf\u000d\u000a      communities.\u000d\u000a    This work proceeds in consultation with the World Federation of the Deaf,\u000d\u000a      facilitated by the fact\u000d\u000a      that several iSLanDS members serve on WFD expert committees. In November\u000d\u000a      2011, Zeshan and\u000d\u000a      Dikyuva were invited to present at a conference on \"Sign languages as\u000d\u000a      endangered languages\"\u000d\u000a      hosted by the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) and the European Union of\u000d\u000a      the Deaf (EUD) in\u000d\u000a      Al, Norway. Zeshan then worked with the sign linguistics expert group of\u000d\u000a      the WFD, as well as with\u000d\u000a      other colleagues in sign linguistics, to adapt the UNESCO questionnaire on\u000d\u000a      language\u000d\u000a      endangerment to the particular situation of sign languages. This\u000d\u000a      questionnaire was used to gather\u000d\u000a      data on endangered sign languages and to analyse them before preparing\u000d\u000a      them for inclusion in the\u000d\u000a      UNESCO Atlas.\u000d\u000a    In addition, iSLanDS has been using a range of channels to raise public\u000d\u000a      awareness about the\u000d\u000a      issue of sign language endangerment. This has included media engagement\u000d\u000a      (e.g. article in the\u000d\u000a      Boston Globe, interview with BBC Radio 4); a video display on sign\u000d\u000a      language endangerment at the\u000d\u000a      iSLanDS 5-year anniversary, which was organised for the general public;\u000d\u000a      and organisation of an\u000d\u000a      exhibition at the EuroBABEL final conference in Leiden, NL, which was\u000d\u000a      attended by both\u000d\u000a      academics and policy-makers. The iSLanDS team twice participated with a\u000d\u000a      stall in the Endangered\u000d\u000a      Languages Week, a public event organised at the School of Oriental and\u000d\u000a      African Languages in\u000d\u000a      London, and Zeshan gave a public lecture at one of these occasions.\u000d\u000a    It has also been important to publicise the value of these minority sign\u000d\u000a      languages in those\u000d\u000a      countries where iSLanDS members have been engaged in fieldwork. In the\u000d\u000a      village of Alipur in\u000d\u000a      South India, Panda organised several workshops for the local community,\u000d\u000a      which led to the opening\u000d\u000a      of a School for the Deaf, and the broadcast of Alipur signs on the local\u000d\u000a      TV channel. In 2013, he\u000d\u000a      visited the village with a documentary film maker, and the raw footage for\u000d\u000a      a documentary film about\u000d\u000a      the community, the deaf people in the village and their sign language, has\u000d\u000a      been shot. Dikyuva and\u000d\u000a      Zeshan held several internal workshops with the users of Mardin Sign\u000d\u000a      Language (MarSL) in Turkey\u000d\u000a      to raise their awareness about the value of their language, including\u000d\u000a      plans for a MarSL website. In\u000d\u000a      February 2013, they presented results of the MarSL project together with\u000d\u000a      five elderly users of\u000d\u000a      MarSL at Ankara University; this was the first time that the MarSL\u000d\u000a      community members were\u000d\u000a      instrumental in presenting their own language and culture to the public.\u000d\u000a      Dikyuva also presented a\u000d\u000a      session on MarSL to 70 deaf delegates at a national meeting of the Turkish\u000d\u000a      National Deaf\u000d\u000a      Federation. In the village of Chican on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico,\u000d\u000a      fieldwork researcher\u000d\u000a      Escobedo Delgado consulted with the local community on practical outcomes\u000d\u000a      from the EuroBABEL\u000d\u000a      project, and as the community wished to produce a dictionary of Chican\u000d\u000a      signs, he has been\u000d\u000a      working with the Ishara Press in the Netherlands on a dictionary project.\u000d\u000a    In the village of Alipur in India, we were drawing on the experience of\u000d\u000a      de Vos in Bali, where, prior to\u000d\u000a      her post at iSLanDS, she had been instrumental in setting up a deaf\u000d\u000a      classroom within the local\u000d\u000a      primary school, in order to provide basic education to the village's deaf\u000d\u000a      children. Panda emulated\u000d\u000a      this model and has worked with the community elders in Alipur, with the\u000d\u000a      aim to provide schooling\u000d\u000a      for deaf children in Alipur. The Unity School for the Deaf was established\u000d\u000a      in 2010 with 17 deaf\u000d\u000a      children, providing access to education for deaf children for the first\u000d\u000a      time within Alipur. The village\u000d\u000a      is now considering a different model, integrating the deaf children into a\u000d\u000a      larger school by setting up\u000d\u000a      a specialist deaf classroom. The acquisition of literacy by the deaf\u000d\u000a      children has enabled significant\u000d\u000a      benefits in their lives and this has filtered through to deaf adults too,\u000d\u000a      who are now able to use SMS\u000d\u000a      messaging. One of the deaf young men who has worked with Panda as a\u000d\u000a      research assistant for\u000d\u000a      several years is now looking for options for admission to university. This\u000d\u000a      kind of local capacity\u000d\u000a      building is at the heart of our approach to social impact of our research.\u000d\u000a      We aim to work with deaf\u000d\u000a      academics from the target countries where we work so that they can take\u000d\u000a      leading roles in local\u000d\u000a      empowerment initiatives.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The International Institute for Sign Languages and Deaf Studies\u000d\u000a        (iSLanDS) has led a large\u000d\u000a      consortium conducting the first-ever substantial comparative study on\u000d\u000a      endangered sign languages\u000d\u000a      in small-scale rural communities with long-standing hereditary deafness\u000d\u000a      (\"village sign languages\").\u000d\u000a      The global impact of this work is seen primarily in the domain of language\u000d\u000a      endangerment through\u000d\u000a      work with UNESCO, with the Foundation for Endangered Languages, and with\u000d\u000a      the World\u000d\u000a      Federation of the Deaf.

This work is in consultation with the\u000d\u000a      World Federation of the\u000d\u000a      Deaf and has put these endangered sign languages literally \"on the map\".\u000d\u000a    Most of this work has been funded by grants awarded to Zeshan as PI.

The iSLanDS\u000d\u000a      team also devoted particular attention to issues of research ethics for\u000d\u000a      this particular kind of\u000d\u000a      fieldwork setting. Many of the consortium members, as well as additional\u000d\u000a      researchers who had\u000d\u000a      been in contact with the team over the lifetime of the project,\u000d\u000a      subsequently worked with iSLanDS\u000d\u000a      on follow-up research to prepare data on endangered village sign languages\u000d\u000a      for publication in the\u000d\u000a      UNESCO Atlas. As no previous standard existed on how to measure\u000d\u000a      and evaluate the degree of\u000d\u000a      endangerment among sign languages, we initiated a separate research stream\u000d\u000a      to develop a robust\u000d\u000a      methodology, and an international committee with members from within and\u000d\u000a      outside iSLanDS was\u000d\u000a      formed in 2013 to develop this line of work further.\u000d\u000a    The EuroBABEL (Better Analyses Based on Endangered Languages) team at\u000d\u000a      UCLan included\u000d\u000a      Panda and de Vos working in India and in Bali, as well as two more deaf\u000d\u000a      fieldwork researchers\u000d\u000a      (Dikyuva and Escobedo Delgado) working in Turkey and Mexico, as well as an\u000d\u000a      MA by Research\u000d\u000a      student (Lanesman) from Israel, who is also deaf. While EuroBABEL was\u000d\u000a      explicitly theory-driven,\u000d\u000a      the project did facilitate primary linguistic documentation, thereby\u000d\u000a      legitimising the languages and\u000d\u000a      their user communities and contributing to greater awareness. Importantly,\u000d\u000a      several smaller projects\u000d\u000a      specifically for language documentation were running in parallel with\u000d\u000a      EuroBABEL at iSLanDS.\u000d\u000a      Thus we received several grants from the Endangered Languages\u000d\u000a      Documentation Programme of\u000d\u000a      the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project for work on rural sign\u000d\u000a      languages in India (PI\u000d\u000a      Panda 2009\/10 for &#163;6,000), Bali (PI de Vos 2011\/12 for &#163;8,000), Turkey (PI\u000d\u000a      Zeshan 2011-2013,\u000d\u000a      &#163;74,000), and Cameroon (PI Lutalo-Kiingi 2013-2015; for post-doctoral work\u000d\u000a      upon leaving\u000d\u000a      iSLanDS).

For instance, MA by Research student Paul Scott has established\u000d\u000a      a partnership with the British Council in Jordan, which has provided\u000d\u000a      training for deaf peer tutors of English literacy (13 participants trained\u000d\u000a      in 2013 and three further groups of trainees in process of being set up).\u000d\u000a      An Indian BA graduate trained 14 deaf peer tutors of English literacy in\u000d\u000a      August 2013 at a large deaf school in India.\u000d\u000a    Through the Ishara Press, of which Zeshan is Editor-in-Chief, young deaf\u000d\u000a      academics can access opportunities to build their CVs through publishing\u000d\u000a      their work or serving on editorial boards, thus avoiding barriers often\u000d\u000a      faced with other academic outlets. Publications in the Sign Language\u000d\u000a      Typology series have included work by five deaf authors in SLT2 and work\u000d\u000a      by six deaf authors in SLT4. Three of the eight current members of the\u000d\u000a      editorial board of the Sign Language Typology Series are deaf.\u000d\u000a    The Sign Language Typology Research Group began organising a workshop\u000d\u000a      series in Cross- Linguistic Sign Language Research (CLSLR) in 2005, and\u000d\u000a      this has now developed into a major international conference series\u000d\u000a      re-named SIGN and now attracting ca. 200 participants regularly. SIGN\u000d\u000a      conferences are unique in that they are held exclusively through sign\u000d\u000a      language and systematically include deaf participants from developing\u000d\u000a      countries from both academic and non- academic circles. Thus SIGN4 was\u000d\u000a      held in New Delhi in 2009, SIGN5 in Turkey in 2011 and SIGN6 in Goa in\u000d\u000a      2013. At the latter conference, representatives of the National\u000d\u000a      Association of the Deaf and the Goa Association of the Deaf were invited\u000d\u000a      keynote presenters. These conferences are a major hub for international\u000d\u000a      deaf academics and for knowledge transfer to international deaf\u000d\u000a      communities. In 2013, an international conference committee was\u000d\u000a      established with members hailing from Belgium, Germany, Nepal, China,\u000d\u000a      India and the UK.\u000d\u000a    Supporting linguistic rights for sign language users\u000d\u000a    In addition to capacity building, one of the most important activities\u000d\u000a      that sign language researchers can engage in is to lobby for the\u000d\u000a      linguistic rights of deaf sign language users through awareness- raising\u000d\u000a      and work with and for deaf organisations. In many countries, particularly\u000d\u000a      developing countries, sign languages still do not have any recognition and\u000d\u000a      deaf sign language users are denied even the most basic services such as\u000d\u000a      accessible education and professional sign language interpreting. iSLanDS\u000d\u000a      members are engaged in a large number of functions within international\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisations, policy makers and professional bodies,\u000d\u000a      which highlight the needs of sign language users:\u000d\u000a    Zeshan (Director of iSLanDS)\u000d\u000a    - President of the Deaf Empowerment Foundation in the Netherlands (2004 -\u000d\u000a      present), and Director the International Deaf Empowerment Foundation in\u000d\u000a      the UK (2010 - present)\u000d\u000a    - Ambassador for Deaf Parenting UK (2009 - present)\u000d\u000a    - Consultancy on sign language endangerment for UNESCO and the Foundation\u000d\u000a      for Endangered Languages (2012 - present)\u000d\u000a    - Consultancy as member of the Expert Group on Sign Language and Deaf\u000d\u000a      Studies at the World Federation of the Deaf (2013 - present)\u000d\u000a    Panda (Lecturer, from India)\u000d\u000a    - Vice President, All India Federation of the Deaf, New Delhi (2010 -\u000d\u000a      present)\u000d\u000a    - Vice President, Indian Sign Language Interpreter Association (2008 -\u000d\u000a      present)\u000d\u000a    - Founding member and trustee, Ishara Foundation, Mumbai (2005 - present)\u000d\u000a    - Board member, Sign Language Linguistics Society (2007 - 2012)\u000d\u000a    - Member of Expert Committee, Rehabilitation Council of India (2011 -\u000d\u000a      present)\u000d\u000a    - Consultancy as member of the Expert Group on Developing Countries at\u000d\u000a      the World Federation of the Deaf (2013 - present)\u000d\u000a    Dikyuva (previous MA by Research student, from Turkey, graduated 2011)\u000d\u000a    - Board member, World Federation of the Deaf (2011 - present)\u000d\u000a    - Board member, Turkish National Federation of the Deaf (2011 - present)\u000d\u000a    Lutalo-Kiingi (current MPhil\/PhD student, from Uganda)\u000d\u000a    - Consultancy as member of the Expert Group on Sign Language and Deaf\u000d\u000a      Studies at the World Federation of the Deaf (2007 - present)\u000d\u000a    This multi-level engagement provides a basis for lobbying for and\u000d\u000a      supporting the development of sign language services internationally.

The Sign Language Typology\u000d\u000a      Research Group led by Zeshan was active at the Max Planck Institute for\u000d\u000a      Psycholinguistics from 2003-2006 and subsequently at the University of\u000d\u000a      Central Lancashire from 2006 onwards.

The most significant hallmark of Sign\u000d\u000a      Language Typology consists of large- scale studies of sign languages from\u000d\u000a      all around the world with respect to particular grammatical\/semantic\u000d\u000a      domains (interrogative and negative constructions 2000-2005, possessive\u000d\u000a      and existential constructions 2004-2008, semantic fields of colour,\u000d\u000a      kinship and quantification 2010 onwards). These studies involve data from\u000d\u000a      several dozen diverse sign languages, and no other studies comparable in\u000d\u000a      size and scope exist anywhere else at the moment. The results of this\u000d\u000a      research have repeatedly provided clear evidence that sign languages have\u000d\u000a      far greater linguistic diversity than was previously recognised, and that\u000d\u000a      the relationship between typological patterns of signed and spoken\u000d\u000a      languages must be appraised individually for each domain rather than\u000d\u000a      assuming that sign languages always constitute a homogeneous linguistic\u000d\u000a      type.\u000d\u000a    In addition to journal articles and other publications, each project in\u000d\u000a      Sign Language Typology leads to the publication of a major edited volume\u000d\u000a      in the Sign Language Typology Series (De Gruyter Mouton &amp; Ishara\u000d\u000a      Press):\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      SLT1: Interrogative and Negative Constructions in Sign Languages,\u000d\u000a        published 2006 (ed.

Importantly, Sign Language\u000d\u000a      Typology also involves the documentation of sign languages that have been\u000d\u000a      previously undescribed. This is a necessary part of Sign Language\u000d\u000a      Typology, as data from many sign languages, particularly in developing\u000d\u000a      countries, are not available and therefore must be generated within each\u000d\u000a      of the projects, using international networks of research partners. This\u000d\u000a      research, often with partners in developing countries, has facilitated\u000d\u000a      documentation and legitimisation of sign languages and user communities.\u000d\u000a      These partnerships enable us to improve educational attainment for deaf\u000d\u000a      sign language users, and promote their linguistic rights through\u000d\u000a      engagement with policy makers and NGOs.

The\u000a      UK Parliament Select Committee was charged with deciding whether to\u000a      devolve this power. Mac Giolla Chr&#237;ost drew on his research as\u000a      co-investigator on From Act to Action [FRP 1] to draw attention to the\u000a      deficiencies of the existing regime and the advantages of devolved\u000a      language structures overseas. He provided the Select Committee with an\u000a      initial briefing paper on the LCO, reviewed the evidence submitted by\u000a      stakeholders and helped draft sections of its final report, including the\u000a      central recommendation which was to devolve legislative competence from\u000a      Westminster to the National Assembly 3.4, 5.4. Meanwhile\u000a      Williams also informed the passage of the LCO through a series of briefing\u000a      and evidence papers to the National Assembly in early 2009. As an\u000a      individual he discussed language policy issues with Ministers and their\u000a      advisers and also as a Member of the Welsh Language Board he briefed\u000a      senior civil servants and NAfW Committees providing evidence-based\u000a      alternative models and detailed best practice examples based on his\u000a      research within other jurisdictions, notably Canada, Ireland, Catalonia\u000a      and Finland. He highlighted From Act to Action's finding that bilingual\u000a      service standards were inconsistently applied across Wales. He argued that\u000a      building the necessary capacity to deliver satisfactory standards should\u000a      be organised at a Welsh level, following the models of devolved\u000a      legislatures abroad.\u000a    Replacement of Welsh Language Schemes\u000a    Following the devolution of language powers in 2009, Williams continued\u000a      to advise the National Assembly. In invited submissions, he advocated an\u000a      overall national standard of bilingual services to the public, citing his\u000a      research showing this was a stronger alternative to the inconsistent\u000a      system of locally-agreed Welsh Language Schemes. 3.4,5.1 In\u000a      the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011, the Welsh Government committed to\u000a      a series of National Standards as a replacement for the Language Schemes.\u000a      Williams has subsequently informed the thinking of the Minister for\u000a      Education and Skills and civil servants on the drafting and implementation\u000a      of this transition from Schemes to Standards.\u000a    A Language Commissioner for Wales\u000a    The 2011 Welsh Language Measure also created the new post of Language\u000a      Commissioner. Again, Williams gave written and oral evidence to the\u000a      Assembly referring to his research into the deficiencies of the 1993 Welsh\u000a      Language Act. He also cited several international precedents, including\u000a      the effect of language commissioners in Canada, Ontario, New Brunswick and\u000a      Ireland.5.3 He argued that a Language Commissioner for Wales\u000a      would act as a more robust ombudsman and articulator of Welsh language\u000a      rights and expectations. Drawing on his work on language rights overseas,\u000a      Williams also provided expert advice which informed the decision to\u000a      include in the 2011 Measure a Tribunal with power to challenge the\u000a      Commissioner's decisions.\u000a    On April 1, 2012, the new Welsh Language Commissioner replaced much of\u000a      the Welsh Language Board, the body responsible for enforcing the previous\u000a      language regime established by the 1993 Act. The Board also held\u000a      responsibility for promoting the Welsh language across Wales. Williams'\u000a      international research had shown how regulatory responsibility could best\u000a      be guaranteed by the appointment of an independent commissioner, freed\u000a      from government intervention, while government was best placed to take on\u000a      responsibility for promotional work on language policy. In his evidence in\u000a      2009-10, Williams recommended that the Welsh Government should take\u000a      responsibility for promotional activity. At the end of March 2012, the\u000a      Board was abolished and its promotional functions transferred to the Welsh\u000a      Government 3.4, 5.3. The work of the Language Commissioner in\u000a      comparative perspective is the focus of an ESRC award for 2012-5 (FRP3).\u000a    Operation of the National Assembly\u000a    In 2011-2, the National Assembly for Wales reconfigured the functions\u000a      governing its own bilingual operations. Williams was invited to contribute\u000a      to the independent review (NAW Report, 2010), while Williams, Mac Giolla\u000a      Chr&#237;ost and S. Brooks informed a later stage through providing expert\u000a      evidence to the Assembly (NAW Report, 2012). These interventions were\u000a      based on research undertaken in Ireland and Wales (FRP 1), 3.4\u000a      demonstrating the advantages of giving a language official status. 5.2,\u000a        5.5 The resultant Official Languages Bill, requiring all\u000a      departments to treat English and Welsh equally, was passed in October\u000a      2012. The former Heritage Minister, Mr A. Ff. Jones has described the\u000a      Cardiff research as \"influential in that it gave us international\u000a      perspectives on the establishment of a Language Commissioner.\" 5.7\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    By 2008, Welsh language policy was failing to deliver consistent\u000a      bilingual public services in Wales.

The problems were:\u000a    \u000a       Lack of institutional capacity and resources to deliver bilingual\u000a        services;\u000a       Lack of buy-in from senior management;\u000a       Inconsistent adherence to fixed deadlines for remedial action;\u000a       Insufficient internal communication of policy objectives;\u000a       Poor monitoring of implementation and updating of the language\u000a        schemes.\u000a    \u000a    Best practice: overseas precedents\u000a    To inform the development of an alternative language regime and\u000a      legislation, Cardiff also systematically researched best practice elements\u000a      of other UK policy fields and international experiences.

The Cwmaman portion of the\u000d\u000a      trail was officially\u000d\u000a      opened in October 2012 in the presence of some 150 people; Davies was an\u000d\u000a      invited speaker at the\u000d\u000a      event which included a musical re-enactment of the story by the children\u000d\u000a      of Ysgol y Bedol, Garnant\u000d\u000a      (see\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.carmarthenshire.gov.uk\/English\/news\/Pages\/HistoricAmmanfordRiversideWalklaunched.aspx).5.2\u000d\u000a      The Twrch Trwyth Trail and similar initiatives will be boosted by the\u000d\u000a      development of\u000d\u000a      Davies' mobile app (see below).\u000d\u000a    Since 2012, Davies has been working closely with the Pembrokeshire-based\u000d\u000a      SME Writemedia\u000d\u000a        Partnership (see http:\/\/www.writemedia.co.uk\/\u000d\u000a      ), a multi-media agency that delivers projects to a\u000d\u000a      wide range of clients such as D&#373;r Cymru Welsh Water, Welsh Rugby Union and\u000d\u000a      the Mary Rose\u000d\u000a      Trust.5.3 In March 2013, Writemedia, in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with Davies, was awarded a grant via the\u000d\u000a      Welsh Government's Digital Tourism Business Framework Programme3.7\u000d\u000a      to produce a sustainable\u000d\u000a      Mabinogion Digital Platform which will support tourism objectives in terms\u000d\u000a      of growth, employment and the footfall of visitors into convergence funded\u000d\u000a      areas of Wales. The\u000d\u000a      total eligible costs of &#163;65,718.00 is matched (47% Claimant contribution)\u000d\u000a      by Writemedia. This is\u000d\u000a      enabling the creation of a Mabinogion web portal and mobile app, providing\u000d\u000a      users with extracts\u000d\u000a      from the texts (both in the original and in Davies' translation) together\u000d\u000a      with geo-locational data to\u000d\u000a      guide them to designated Mabinogion sites and access resources such as\u000d\u000a      videos, stories and\u000d\u000a      anecdotes associated with these locations. Specific trails and walks are\u000d\u000a      also being created in\u000d\u000a      partnership with local tourist authorities, e.g. the Narberth Trail, the\u000d\u000a      Rhonabwy Trail, and the Trail\u000d\u000a      of the Severed Head. GPS marketing solutions are being provided to assist\u000d\u000a      visitors with their travel\u000d\u000a      information, stopovers, food and beverage. The aim is to introduce the\u000d\u000a      Mabinogion tales to a new\u000d\u000a      audience whilst engaging with tourism in Wales so as to enhance the\u000d\u000a      visitor experience.\u000d\u000a    Domain 3: Contemporary storytelling\u000d\u000a      Davies' research on performativity and storytelling has contributed to the\u000d\u000a      renewal of the practice of\u000d\u000a      telling the Mabinogion by contemporary practitioners of the art of\u000d\u000a      storytelling. In July 2010, Davies\u000d\u000a      held a session for storytellers on performing the Mabinogion at the Beyond\u000d\u000a      the Border International\u000d\u000a      Storytelling Festival (St Donat's, Vale of Glamorgan) and in October 2011\u000d\u000a      led a weekend workshop\u000d\u000a      at a Storytelling Retreat in Aberporth, organised by international\u000d\u000a      storytellers Hugh Lupton and Eric\u000d\u000a      Maddern (attendance: 20). A further workshop, entitled Performing the\u000d\u000a        Mabinogion: A Workshop\u000d\u000a        for Storytellers, was held at Chapter Arts Centre, Cardiff, in July\u000d\u000a      2013, attended by 13 participants.\u000d\u000a      Ninety percent of those who completed a questionnaire (n=10) indicated\u000d\u000a      that they would use the\u000d\u000a      information and insights gleaned in the workshop in the future. All\u000d\u000a      participants stated that they\u000d\u000a      would welcome further workshops on the topic and this has been actioned.\u000d\u000a      These workshops\u000d\u000a      confirmed and developed the use of Davies' translation by a community of\u000d\u000a      professional storytellers.\u000d\u000a      So, for example, Michael Harvey5.4 and Cath Little attended the\u000d\u000a      July 2013 workshop and will be\u000d\u000a      collaborating with Davies on planned future projects. According to Little,\u000d\u000a      `I have used the\u000d\u000a      translation in my piece inspired by The Lady of the Well. The show has\u000d\u000a      been well received in\u000d\u000a      venues across England and Wales and was recently performed at the opening\u000d\u000a      night of the Settle\u000d\u000a      Storytelling Festival... the translation has really helped me bring the\u000d\u000a      stories to a wider audience.' In\u000d\u000a      addition, Harvey claims that two of the strongest influences on his\u000d\u000a      ability to seriously begin\u000d\u000a      performing the Mabinogion were Davies' Crefft y Cyfarwydd together\u000d\u000a      with her translation of the\u000d\u000a      tales; he states, `I have been lucky enough to have performed stories from\u000d\u000a      the Mabinogion\u000d\u000a      throughout Wales as well as the rest of the UK, Europe and America and the\u000d\u000a      fact that these\u000d\u000a      strange yet recognisable landscapes have become real for so many audiences\u000d\u000a      is in no small part\u000d\u000a      due to Professor Davies' rigorous and accessible scholarship.'\u000d\u000a    Domain 4: Commercial sales\u000d\u000a      The scholarly and popular reach of Davies' OUP translation is reflected in\u000d\u000a      the global sales of the\u000d\u000a      book (32,325 total sales since publication) of which 22,767 were in the\u000d\u000a      period 1st January 2008 to\u000d\u000a      31st July 2013, comprising 4,909 hardback, 16,596 paperback and\u000d\u000a      1,262 in electronic format.5.5\u000d\u000a      This reflects a major commercial success for a translation originally\u000d\u000a      intended for primarily\u000d\u000a      academic use.

Higher\u000a      linguistic attainment is in direct relation to more opportunities of\u000a      social integration and economic prosperity. However, many adults have\u000a      problems learning grammatical features.\u000a    This research focuses on the second language acquisition of tense and\u000a      aspect, areas of grammar which practitioners find particularly difficult\u000a      to teach and learners find persistently problematic to acquire. The\u000a      findings, which explain where the problems lie and provide solutions to\u000a      overcome them, have led the research team to develop and deliver professional\u000a        development workshops for language teachers.\u000a    The workshops have three impacts for participants:\u000a    \u000a      an enhanced knowledge of the linguistic properties of tense and\u000a        aspect;\u000a      an understanding of the reasons underlying learners' difficulties;\u000a      the consideration of effective pedagogical techniques in grammar\u000a        teaching.\u000a    \u000a    The workshops are offered with the aim of equipping teachers with\u000a      practical and theoretical knowledge to boost their self-confidence, and\u000a      transform tense and aspect instruction into a more meaningful and\u000a      rewarding experience. In turn this motivates and engages language students\u000a      to develop their language skills in this area.\u000a    The project is currently in the pilot phase: the workshops were first\u000a      piloted at the University of Greenwich with in-house language teachers and\u000a      their feedback provided the opportunity to improve, eg to make sure that\u000a      more everyday language was used for some of the technical vocabulary. To\u000a      date the workshop has been facilitated at two language schools in London\u000a      (May and June 2013). The first workshop was unavoidably delivered on two\u000a      dates, with five participants attending the first part and eight attending\u000a      the second part. The second workshop had five participants.\u000a    Two types of feedback are gathered. The first is a questionnaire\u000a      completed by participants immediately after the workshop. The second is\u000a      feedback requested from line managers after two weeks. An example comment\u000a      is: \"They (the teachers) got a lot out of it in terms of their\u000a      professional development as teachers, in deepening their understanding of\u000a      L2 acquisition, their individual learners and the concept of fossilised\u000a      errors.\" The feedback offered the following evidence of the three impacts:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aExpanding teacher knowledge of tense and aspect\u000a        The first impact of our research has been that teachers have become more\u000a        confident and knowledgeable practitioners, by giving them a deeper\u000a        understanding of the properties underlying tense and aspect forms. Of\u000a        the thirteen participants, twelve claim to have found it very useful to\u000a        have increased their knowledge of the underlying properties of tense and\u000a        aspect.\u000a      \u000aUnderstanding students' persistent difficulties with tense and\u000a          aspect\u000a        The second impact has been that twelve out of the thirteen teachers\u000a        found it extremely helpful to explore why L2 learners find tense and\u000a        aspect so difficult to acquire. One teacher commented that \"teachers\u000a        tend to ignore the reasons why students find it so difficult to acquire\u000a        tense and aspect due to a lack of insight\". They now understand\u000a        that there will be different rates of progress amongst learners from\u000a        different L1 backgrounds within a class, as well as different levels of\u000a        attainment, and they can act upon this accordingly in the classroom.\u000a      \u000aLearning effective pedagogy\u000a        The third impact has been to enhance participants' understanding of\u000a        effective pedagogical techniques in grammar instruction. Nine out ten\u000a        participants found it very useful. They particularly welcomed the\u000a        practical applications and examples, as exemplified by \"much to test in\u000a        the classroom, with some practical advice on task development\".\u000a    \u000a    Participants reported that they had incorporated the newly learnt\u000a      knowledge and strategies into their lesson plans and teaching practice,\u000a      providing a long-term effect of the impact of the activity. Finally,\u000a      according to the feedback, seventeen out of eighteen participants would\u000a      definitely recommend the workshop, with one teacher commenting \"It was\u000a      extremely useful. The workshop raised valid points; therefore all teachers\u000a      should attend one.\" Both Directors of Studies have also asked the team to\u000a      facilitate further workshops.\u000a    The learning and teaching principles apply to other areas of grammar, eg\u000a      gender concord and determiners, so new workshops covering these aspects\u000a      are being developed as well as rolling out the tense and aspect workshop.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research focuses on the second language acquisition (SLA) of tense\u000a      and aspect, which are persistently problematic areas of grammar for\u000a      language students to master.

For example, Chinese speakers\u000a      of English who learn English as a second language as adults appear to have\u000a      persistent difficulties developing and producing the past simple tense in\u000a      English (eg I walked to work), even at high levels of proficiency\u000a      in English [3.5]. A further example is the acquisition of the present\u000a      perfect (eg I have walked to work), where difficulties persist at\u000a      high levels of proficiency across learners from many L1 backgrounds [3.6,\u000a      3.8].\u000a    To tackle the issue of why these persistent difficulties arise, and in\u000a      turn help teachers to understand their students' lack of attainment, it is\u000a      fundamental to understand what learners bring from their first language\u000a      and how the relationships between forms and meanings are constructed in\u000a      the second language (L2). To this end, theoretical and empirical work\u000a      undertaken by Liszka (1998-current) has contributed to shedding light on\u000a      the acquisition pathways of different tense and aspect forms. She has\u000a      raised and tested hypotheses concerning the reasons for lack of complete\u000a      attainment in SLA.\u000a    The findings suggest:\u000a    a) tense and aspect properties are transferred from the L1 and continue\u000a      to influence L2 development, even at very high levels of proficiency;\u000a    b) where the L1-L2 pairing shares a certain property, learners acquire\u000a      that property in a native- like way;\u000a    c) where the L1-L2 pairing does not share a certain property, learners\u000a      continue to have persistent difficulty acquiring that property;\u000a    d) these persistent difficulties appear to be linked with the age\u000a      learning begins, suggesting a critical period around or after puberty.\u000a    If Liszka has identified which learners have problems and why,\u000a        Professor Benati (Professor of Applied Linguistics &amp; Second\u000a      Language Studies, 1992-current) complements her findings with an expertise\u000a      in teaching grammar to second language students, ie helping students pick\u000a      up grammar which is alien to them. He is a pioneer in the fields of Input\u000a      Processing and Processing Instruction. Input processing argues that\u000a      learners can be taught to note grammatical items, often without resorting\u000a      to conscious knowledge; processing instruction looks at how best to\u000a      enhance and present materials to learners.\u000a    Benati's research (2003-current) has been productive and informative for\u000a      second language teachers. He has repeatedly demonstrated the effects of\u000a      processing instruction under a variety of conditions, teasing out\u000a      variables and testing the effects with different languages, different\u000a      structures, and different learners. His research provides pedagogical\u000a      solutions for a range of issues including tense and aspect, e.g. for\u000a      teaching redundant forms such as -ed- and third person singular -s- and\u000a      for syntactic structure as passive constructions in English.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4671","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Leeder has played a crucial role encouraging and advising poets,\u000d\u000a      translators, artists and cultural organisations to advance the performance\u000d\u000a      and presentation of modern German poetry in the UK and beyond.

She also participated alongside Martyn Crucefix, Don\u000d\u000a        Paterson, Philip Pullman and Rowan Williams in `Among the Ranks of\u000d\u000a      the Angels - Rainer Maria Rilke' (Radio 3, 27\/03\/11 and 05\/08\/11),\u000d\u000a      unpacking Rilke's Elegies for a general audience.\u000d\u000a    The confidence and interest in Leeder's work has led to repeat requests\u000d\u000a      for advice and participation. Leeder was commissioned to write and present\u000d\u000a      a Radio 4 programme on Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus (Dancing the Orange,\u000d\u000a      21 and 27\/07\/13, Radio Choice in The Times,\u000d\u000a      20\/07\/13). The producer said: \"A number of people who heard the programme\u000d\u000a      told me that they were impressed by Karen's depth of knowledge, her\u000d\u000a      ability to communicate complexity engagingly and her own engagement with\u000d\u000a      the subject. My editor and the commissioning editor were pleased and have\u000d\u000a      encouraged me to submit more proposals for programmes presented by Karen.\"[3]\u000d\u000a    Reaching out through cultural events\u000d\u000a    Leeder has participated in, chaired and curated public events, as a\u000d\u000a      vehicle for raising cultural awareness and public appreciation of modern\u000d\u000a      German poetry. Her research on the reception of Brecht's poetry led to an\u000d\u000a      invitation to chair a public event with poets Bernard O'Donoghue\u000d\u000a      and Jamie McKendrick (03\/03\/13), as part of the `The Rest Is\u000d\u000a        Noise' festival[ii]. The session combined readings\u000d\u000a      and poems sung with piano accompaniment and discussion to engage the 400-\u000d\u000a      strong audience with Brecht's poems. The Festival Programme Manager[1]\u000d\u000a      said: `Karen's academic expertise was to the fore in advising on the shape\u000d\u000a      and material used in our Brecht poetry event [...] the event [...] was\u000d\u000a      very well judged, allowing space for new research and insights about\u000d\u000a      Brecht to come to the fore.'\u000d\u000a    She advised on and chaired a post-performance discussion with\u000d\u000a      distinguished photographers Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin\u000d\u000a      and conductor Paul Kildea at the film and opera event based on their\u000d\u000a      artists' book War Primer 2[iii] (a\u000a      contemporary recasting of Brecht's Kriegsfibel) at the London\u000d\u000a        Photographers' Gallery (25\/04\/2013). Chanarin emailed afterwards:\u000d\u000a      `Thank you for a wonderfully informative introduction last night. I think\u000d\u000a      you managed to set just the right tone, and create an atmosphere in which\u000d\u000a      the audience felt able to participate' (26\/04\/13). The Academy of Arts\u000d\u000a        in Berlin has requested a repeat of the event next year.\u000d\u000a    Developing professional practices for translators and other\u000d\u000a        professional groups\u000d\u000a    Leeder's research and prize-winning translations have helped to change\u000d\u000a      how German poetry is translated into English, and how artists respond to\u000d\u000a      it in their own work. She has served in a consultative capacity on various\u000d\u000a      non-academic bodies including the English PEN, the Translator's\u000a        Association of the Society of Authors, the British Centre for\u000d\u000a        Literary Translation, and New Books in German (a trade\u000d\u000a      magazine). She was a member of the editorial board and then a trustee of Modern\u000a        Poetry in Translation and a Judge of the Schlegel-Tieck Prize\u000d\u000a      for German translation, the Times \/ Stephen Spender Poetry Competition\u000d\u000a      and the Poetry Society Corneliu M. Popescu Prize 2013[iv].\u000d\u000a      This has further enhanced the visibility of German poetry in the UK and\u000d\u000a      within the poetry and translation communities.\u000d\u000a    She has influenced translation practices through working directly with\u000d\u000a      translators such as Martyn Crucefix[4] and also through\u000d\u000a      knowledge-sharing via events and the media. Thus she chaired a round table\u000d\u000a      on `The Art of Translation', with Jenny Erpenbeck, Michael Hulse, and\u000d\u000a      Marco Szondi, for an audience of 250 at the Writers and Readers\u000d\u000a        Festival in Wellington, New Zealand (04\/13). In 2008 she held a\u000d\u000a      round table with industry specialists (publishers, theatre workers,\u000d\u000a      translators, etc.) at Tate Liverpool[v] intended\u000d\u000a      to overcome the practical and cultural challenges of presenting\u000d\u000a      German-language culture to a British audience. One translator at the event\u000d\u000a      commented: `Leeder has been a substantial influence on my career as a\u000d\u000a      translator [...]. I have also been inspired by her approach to the\u000d\u000a      practice of translation - hearing her talk about translating poetry has\u000d\u000a      helped me to think through the process, and to develop my own creativity\u000d\u000a      in translating literature.'\u000d\u000a    Stimulating and shaping creative practice\u000d\u000a    Leeder's research on Rilke and Brecht has led to work with major UK\u000d\u000a      poets. She has advised Jamie McKendrick, Robin Robertson, and Martyn\u000d\u000a        Crucefix[4] on their Rilke translations and poems\u000d\u000a      `after', Rilke, including Crucefix's version of the Sonnets to Orpheus\u000d\u000a      (2012) and the Duino Elegies (2006) which has been toured by Aya\u000a        Theatre in London (2012 and 2013). She worked with Andy Croft\u000d\u000a      on his poems `after Brecht'; his poem `In the Brecht Museum' (in Sticky,\u000d\u000a      Flambard Press, 2009) is dedicated to her and responds directly to her\u000d\u000a      research on Brecht [&#167;3.3].\u000d\u000a    Leeder's research on emerging German poets and her translations of their\u000d\u000a      work has helped them to establish their presence and careers. Her research\u000d\u000a      on the Austrian poet Evelyn Schlag[5] led to\u000d\u000a      commissions which have been instrumental in increasing Schlag's profile in\u000d\u000a      the UK and beyond: e.g. Schlag's poem `Honeymoon Years' (tr. Leeder) was\u000d\u000a      selected for World Poetry Day by the European Commission and the\u000d\u000a      European Parliament, November 2008. Schlag was selected as Austria's\u000d\u000a      representative in the 2012 London Olympics' Poetry Parnassus\u000d\u000a          [vi] where she read a poem translated by Leeder.\u000d\u000a      Schlag said of Leeder: `Not only have her articles given me a profile,\u000d\u000a      collaborating on the translations with a sensitive translator such as\u000d\u000a      Karen Leeder has also had an influence on my own writing.'\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Leeder has made a major contribution to raising the levels of\u000d\u000a      cultural awareness and understanding of modern German poetry in the UK and\u000d\u000a      beyond. Her research has enabled the English-speaking public to discover\u000d\u000a      poetry previously unknown to them and has brought emerging poetry into the\u000d\u000a      public realm.

This led to HEFCE\u000d\u000a      funding in 2003-4 to compile a database of poetry `after Brecht',\u000d\u000a      to publish two anthologies of these poems and a further four articles\u000d\u000a      drawing on the research to illuminate the reception of Brecht's poetry\u000d\u000a      today. Leeder's research moves beyond the political controversy that\u000d\u000a      traditionally surrounds Brecht's reputation, and explores the work of the\u000d\u000a      great lyric poet. In putting Brecht's poetry into new contexts - for\u000d\u000a      example his relationship with the English-speaking world, the reception of\u000d\u000a      his poetry by later generations - she has redefined ways of approaching\u000d\u000a      him. Leeder undertook similar research on Rilke, another great German\u000d\u000a      poet: tracing the `English Rilke' from first translations through\u000d\u000a      to modern responses from a range of major UK and US poets, examining how\u000d\u000a      they reflect the contexts in which he has been rewritten, and what it\u000d\u000a      reveals about his lyric capacities. Preliminary conclusions were published\u000d\u000a      in her contribution to The Cambridge Companion to Rilke[2].\u000d\u000a    Arising out of these `legacy' projects came Leeder's growing interest in\u000d\u000a      `lateness' in modern poetry, the notion of work influenced by old\u000d\u000a      age or incapacity, or self-consciously `after'. Leeder is the first to\u000d\u000a      apply this to the poetry of the `belated' nation Germany, but\u000d\u000a      simultaneously also to challenge the biographically-inflected notions of\u000d\u000a      `late style' as advanced by Adorno or Said and to place `lateness' as a\u000d\u000a      broader category within the context of philosophies of time and speed.

As\u000d\u000a      part of the world celebrations of the poet\u000d\u000a      Cavafy, Papanikolaou organised a successful `Cavafy week' in Oxford (3-8\u000d\u000a      June 2013) comprising\u000d\u000a      public events and an interactive Facebook page.

The event attracted a broad and\u000d\u000a      international audience and generated significant\u000d\u000a      publicity and social media attention.\u000d\u000a    Supporting activist and lobbying groups\u000d\u000a    Many of his pieces have become core reading and debating material for\u000d\u000a      queer activist groups and\u000d\u000a      lobbyists. Such groups use Papanikolaou's work as an enabling platform, in\u000d\u000a      order to pursue new\u000d\u000a      agendas on gender and sexuality in Greece.\u000d\u000a    For instance, the internet forum of the collective `queertrans', a\u000d\u000a      radical transsexual and gay rights\u000d\u000a      activist group, discuss in their forum a lecture Papanikolaou had given: \"his\u000d\u000a        lecture was amazing...\u000d\u000a        a very strong lecture; I will look into his work further\"[iv]\u000d\u000a      says one post; further posts contain links to\u000d\u000a      his other articles and references to his work. The group invited him to\u000d\u000a      speak to one of their closed\u000d\u000a      meetings (6 March 2013) where he shared his research insights with the\u000d\u000a      members. Similarly, an\u000d\u000a      article on archives of sexuality and lesbian literature was distributed\u000d\u000a      and discussed among\u000d\u000a      members of the Lesbian Group of Athens (LOA; the core Greek lesbian\u000d\u000a      activist group), who also\u000d\u000a      commented on Papanikolaou's work in their publications. Papanikolaou has\u000d\u000a      also spoken in\u000d\u000a      meetings with queer activist groups in Athens and London (throughout\u000d\u000a      2011-13).\u000d\u000a    Papanikolaou's reflections on Greek new queer cinema (and in particular\u000d\u000a      the film Strella: A\u000d\u000a        Woman's Way (2009)) have raised awareness of trans-sexual politics.\u000d\u000a      He was invited to speak on\u000d\u000a      queer cinema at an activist event held by the LGBT publishing venture\u000d\u000a      Polychromos Planetes\u000d\u000a      (2011)[vii]. Last, but not least, a documentary on `Racism,\u000d\u000a      Homophobia and Thanatopolitics',\u000d\u000a      expressly influenced by Papanikolaou's recent work, is in production by a\u000d\u000a      group of Athenian-based\u000d\u000a      investigative journalists headed by Augustine Zenakos.\u000d\u000a    Influencing policy-makers\u000d\u000a    Papanikolaou's writings on queer theory and politics (including an\u000d\u000a      article charting the gay marriage\u000d\u000a      debate from theoretical and political angles, published in Ta Nea,\u000d\u000a      14\/6\/2008) have led to\u000d\u000a      Papanikolaou being consulted by lobbyists and political advisers working\u000d\u000a      for policy change [3]. As a\u000d\u000a      result, Papanikolaou was consulted, in 2013, by a group led by MP\u000d\u000a      Vassiliki Katrivanou, working\u000d\u000a      on the proposal for a bill on gay marriage and new legislation on\u000d\u000a      homophobic crimes[4].\u000d\u000a    Moreover, in May 2013 Papanikolaou was invited to participate in a\u000d\u000a      consultation event on the gay\u000d\u000a      marriage bill, gender politics, and the new policy agendas needed to\u000d\u000a      combat homophobia,\u000d\u000a      organized by the main opposition Greek party SYRIZA in the Greek\u000d\u000a      parliament. According to\u000d\u000a      shadow minister Rena Dourou, who was present in the event, Papanikolaou's\u000d\u000a      articles \"are\u000d\u000a        currently having an immense educational impact on MPs, political\u000d\u000a        activists and policymakers; he is\u000d\u000a        providing us with a new vocabulary to tackle very important challenges.\"\u000d\u000a    Influencing policies of educational and cultural institutions\u000d\u000a    Papanikolaou's work on the poet Cavafy, has led to a reconsideration of\u000d\u000a      the queer aspects of the\u000d\u000a      author's work in Greece (where this issue is still treated as taboo), and\u000d\u000a      impacted on the official\u000d\u000a      cultural policies of Greek cultural and educational institutions regarding\u000d\u000a      this central Greek author.\u000d\u000a      In January 2013 Papanikolaou was appointed by the Greek Ministry of\u000d\u000a      Culture to stand on its\u000d\u000a      Cavafy Committee advising on and distributing funding for new media and\u000d\u000a      performance activities\u000d\u000a      for the 150th anniversary of Cavafy's birth. His input induced the\u000d\u000a      Ministry to adopt `Cavafy and\u000d\u000a      communities of readers' as a central policy priority. Moreover, the\u000d\u000a      Onassis Foundation, which\u000d\u000a      acquired the Cavafy Archive in early 2013, has appointed Papanikolaou as\u000d\u000a      an advisor, and used\u000d\u000a      his work in the promotion of their celebration of Cavafy's poetry. `Dr\u000d\u000a        Papanikolaou's academic work\u000d\u000a        [...] has inspired and influenced how the Cavafy Archive approaches the\u000d\u000a        legacy it plays host to and\u000d\u000a        the events of the Onassis Cultural Centre relating to it.[...] This\u000d\u000a        report and Dr Papanikolaou's\u000d\u000a        overall advice have been stimulating, invigorating and inspiring.

He\u000d\u000a      has done extensive research on discourses about sexuality in modern Greece\u000d\u000a      and in particular on\u000d\u000a      the major poet C.P. Cavafy (1863-1933), from the perspective of queer\u000d\u000a      theory.\u000d\u000a    Since 2001 Papanikolaou has been working on a new approach to Cavafy's\u000d\u000a      work, informed by the\u000d\u000a      history of sexuality and new queer theories of desire[1][2].\u000d\u000a      His research, within a well-defined\u000d\u000a      theoretical framework, has refined and re-defined aspects of Cavafy's work\u000d\u000a      that were hitherto\u000d\u000a      silenced or overlooked by academia. By placing Cavafy within a theoretical\u000d\u000a      background of queer\u000d\u000a      theory and histories of sexual subjectivity, Papanikolaou has revealed the\u000d\u000a      relevance and\u000d\u000a      importance of Cavafy both synchronically and diachronically.\u000d\u000a    Moreover, Papanikolaou has underlined the hitherto disavowed impact of\u000d\u000a      Cavafy on the formation\u000d\u000a      and development of queer identity within and beyond Greece, and has\u000d\u000a      proposed Cavafy as a\u000d\u000a      prime example for new debates on queer theory. As one academic reviewer\u000d\u000a      put it, his work\u000d\u000a      presents `a highly original, convincing, timely and potentially\u000d\u000a      paradigm-shifting argument on\u000d\u000a      Cavafy's position in the history both of Greek literature and of the queer\u000d\u000a      imagination' (blind peer\u000d\u000a      review for [2]). Papanikolaou has published several articles\u000d\u000a        [3] on Cavafy and sexuality in this period,\u000d\u000a      and given a number of presentations on the topic, in universities and\u000d\u000a      conferences worldwide. A\u000d\u000a      monograph on Cavafy and queer theory is to be published by the major Greek\u000d\u000a      publisher Patakis in\u000d\u000a      late 2013.\u000d\u000a    Throughout his time at Oxford, Papanikolaou has also been collecting\u000d\u000a      material on 20th-century\u000d\u000a      Greek cultures of sexuality (film, literature, art) and offering new\u000d\u000a      theoretical tools for a critical\u000d\u000a      reappraisal of Greek cultural texts related to sexuality. He has conducted\u000d\u000a      research on Greek queer\u000d\u000a      authors Capetanakis[4], Scouffi, Dora Rozeti, Lapathiotis,\u000d\u000a      Taktsis, Tsarouchis, Ioannou, Angelakis,\u000d\u000a      and examined the Zorba archetype in relation to homosociality and its\u000d\u000a      impact on concepts of\u000d\u000a      heteronormative national identity and masculinity[5]. He\u000d\u000a      published an influential essay[6] arguing that\u000d\u000a      Elias Petropoulos's popular books about Greece have impacted on Greek\u000d\u000a      sexuality by\u000d\u000a      inadvertently cementing stereotypes and perpetuating the imbalances and\u000d\u000a      injustices they purport\u000d\u000a      to rebel against. Papanikolaou re-edited the classic queer short story\u000d\u000a      cycle Ta Resta by Taktsis,\u000d\u000a      providing a well-reviewed essay as afterword. He also wrote the chapter on\u000d\u000a      Athens in a\u000d\u000a      forthcoming book on Queer Cities, charting the history of sexual\u000d\u000a      subcultures in the city since the\u000d\u000a      1950s.\u000d\u000a    In addition, Papanikolaou has carried out extensive research on\u000d\u000a      contemporary Greek cultural texts\u000d\u000a      from the perspective of gender and sexuality, aiming to bring queer theory\u000d\u000a      into closer dialogue with\u000d\u000a      contemporary Greek cultural production, while popularising a critical\u000d\u000a      vocabulary not until that time\u000d\u000a      widely adopted in Greek media. He has written on queer filmmakers\u000d\u000a      Giannaris[7] and Koutras and\u000d\u000a      reviewed works by, among others, Dimitriadis, Tsiolkas, Dimitrakaki,\u000d\u000a      Corteau, Tzoumerkas. Being\u000d\u000a      mostly the first commentaries to address these works with a critical and\u000d\u000a      analytical vocabulary\u000d\u000a      based on gender studies, these essays have exerted a wide influence.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4893","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Biak is a vulnerable language with no firmly established orthography.\u000a      Dalrymple and Mofu's research in this area is having considerable impact\u000a      on preventing the language from extinction and allowing audio and written\u000a      material to become available to teach future generations. As with any\u000a      living language, without children speaking and writing the language, Biak\u000a      would never survive. New bilingual dictionaries (Indonesian-Biak) written\u000a      using the orthography developed at Oxford will allow these children to\u000a      remain truly bilingual. This not only supports the growth of educational\u000a      material for teaching children, but also forms the basis for adult\u000a      literacy and development of dictionaries allowing adults to develop the\u000a      use of Biak in regular interaction as well as underpin development of\u000a      literary material. Further details of impact are listed below.\u000a    Enabling the teaching of Biak to school children through the\u000a        development of educational materials:\u000a    As the UNESCO publication \"First Language First\" (2005) observes, the\u000a      Indonesian government advocates use of elementary students' first language\u000a      in the first three years of elementary school, accompanied by instruction\u000a      in Indonesian, for students who do not speak Indonesian as a first\u000a      language. Thus, the Biak dictionary is crucial for use of the language\u000a      among school children. The situation in Papua is difficult, however, since\u000a      the population is relatively small (about 3.5 million, about 14% of\u000a      Indonesia's population of 237 million), while almost 300 of the 700\u000a      languages spoken in Indonesia are spoken in Papua. This makes the task of\u000a      creating local curricular material difficult, and due to these resource\u000a      constraints it has been impossible to produce suitable resources for many\u000a      languages, despite government policy. Consequently, resources developed at\u000a      Oxford have assisted in the creation of these resources for Biak in\u000a      several ways. First, the Biak orthography used in our database files has\u000a      become standard, and is used in Biak-Indonesian dictionaries in schools in\u000a      Biak-speaking areas of West Papua. Second, textbooks and other curricular\u000a      materials are being created on the basis of our texts by Mr. Rumbrawer of\u000a      UNCEN. \"Now, our children and our children's children can hear and\u000a        read our language online and they can also read printed materials that\u000a        your team has developed both at UNCEN Jayapura and UNIPA Manokwari... We\u000a        are happy to see that many schools in Biak now use materials produced by\u000a        Mr Frans Rumbrawer, one member of your team, and his colleagues in\u000a        Jayapura. We hope that the regional government would provide funding so\u000a        that Biak text books and dictionaries created by UNCEN and UNIPA would\u000a        be produced for all schools in the Biak regency.\" [see\u000a          &#167;5.1]\u000a    Providing best practice in language documentation enabling others to\u000a        replicate these methods for Biak and other endangered languages:\u000a    Dalrymple and Mofu's database is valuable not only as a record of the\u000a      Biak language, but as an example of best practices in language\u000a      documentation for other projects to follow. The beneficiaries include the\u000a      international linguistic community as well as other interested bodies in\u000a      attempting to document endangered languages or indeed any language, e.g.\u000a      Biak has its own page on the website of OLAC, \"the Open Language Archives\u000a      Community, is an international partnership of institutions and individuals\u000a      who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by: (a)\u000a      developing consensus on best current practice for the digital archiving of\u000a      language resources, and (b) developing a network of interoperating\u000a      repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources.\" [i]\u000a      Links have also been made to their work from the West Papuan blog\u000a      Selamatkan Bahasa Leluhur Kita (Save Our Ancestors' Language) [ii],\u000a      and from Wilco van den Heuvel's web pages \"The Biak Language in its\u000a      cultural context\" [iii]. There is also a page of Biak\u000a      resources on DBpedia, a crowd-sourced community project which extracts\u000a      structured information from Wikipedia and makes it available on the Web.\u000a      The project was started and is administered by research groups from\u000a      Universit&#228;t Leipzig, Freie Universit&#228;t Berlin, and OpenLink Software [iv].\u000a    Dalrymple and Mofu provided training in state-of-the-art language\u000a      documentation practices to researchers and faculty members at University\u000a      of West Papua (UNIPA) and Cenderawasih University, Papua Province (UNCEN),\u000a      enabling local communities to pursue documentation efforts for the\u000a      hundreds of under-documented and undocumented languages of the area. The\u000a      research has formed the basis of theoretical and applied linguistic work\u000a      on Biak at UNCEN and UNIPA, including a trilingual Biak-Indonesian-English\u000a      dictionary [v] created using the wordlist from our\u000a      project, and illustrated with example sentences from our texts and their\u000a      translations into English and Indonesian; work on the dictionary is\u000a      complete, and a publisher is being sought. \"I have got copies of the\u000a        on-line materials and also Biak - English and Biak - Indonesian\u000a        dictionaries which were produced by UNIPA as a result of your project.\u000a        The dictionaries are, for me, the first comprehensive dictionaries\u000a        because they contain real data and real examples from formal to informal\u000a        uses of our language.\" [2]\u000a    Empowering local communities to save their own endangered languages\u000a        through provision of language documentation skills training:\u000a    The project's work was conducted in collaboration with Mr. Frans\u000a      Rumbrawer (UNCEN) and Mr. Alfons Arsai (UNIPA), with assistance from Ms.\u000a      Jinni Makabori and Ms. Denise Mambrasar, also of UNIPA, and the\u000a      participation of UNIPA and UNCEN linguistics departments. The training in\u000a      language documentation which Oxford provided at UNIPA bore fruit in our\u000a      2010-11 Leverhulme- funded documentation project for Dusner, a severely\u000a      endangered Austronesian language of West Papua. Ms. Mambrasar and Ms.\u000a      Makobari were central participants in the Dusner project, and they have\u000a      recently secured scholarships for training in academic English\u000a      (April-October 2013), in preparation for attending graduate school in\u000a      linguistics. Mr. Rumbrawer is currently pursuing a PhD in Linguistics at a\u000a      university in Central Java. Local community members have been thus\u000a      empowered with skills to begin documenting other severely endangered\u000a      languages of Papua.\u000a    The Biak community has been very supportive and appreciative of the\u000a      results in allowing them to preserve their endangered language: \"As a\u000a        young man from Biak and one of the Biak Customary Council members I felt\u000a        so grateful that, finally, you made our dream comes true. Seeing our\u000a        language documented online and is freely available for all Biak speakers\u000a        is a real blessing.\" [2] The Chief of the Biak\u000a      Customary Council writes enthusiastically about Prof Dalrymple and Dr\u000a      Mofu's work on Biak, saying \"I have seen the impact of the work they\u000a        have done that have motivated and strengthened several efforts by local\u000a        communities to preserve and develop the language\". [3]\u000a      Dr. Mofu gave a presentation of the project database in a general\u000a      public meeting of the Biak community in Manokwari, West Papua (19 December\u000a      2012); the excitement and enthusiasm for the work that was generated by\u000a      this meeting resulted in a follow-up prayer meeting (Manokwari, 3 February\u000a      2013), organised by members of the Biak community, to give thanks for the\u000a      project and the database it produced. Each meeting was attended by about\u000a      50 Biak speakers from the Manokwari area. \"The fear that our language\u000a        will disappear is now replaced with happiness that there is a hope for\u000a        its survival...\" [1]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Biak (West Papua, Indonesia) is an endangered language with no previously\u000a      established orthography.

This database, developed\u000a      in collaboration with Universitas Cenderawasih and Universitas Negeri\u000a      Papua, is one of the first, not just for a lesser studied Austronesian\u000a      language, but for any lesser studied language. Even now such\u000a      databases are very rare.\u000a    Traditional methods of language documentation are paper-and-pencil based,\u000a      relying on the transcription skills and analytic capabilities of the\u000a      investigating linguist; traditional databases are often small, consisting\u000a      of a few short transcribed texts as an appendix to a written grammar. In\u000a      describing the emergence of documentary linguistics as an important\u000a      subfield, Himmelmann (2006) notes several reasons for creating databases\u000a      containing transcribed and analysed recordings of primary data, like\u000a      Oxford's Biak database: (i) many under-documented languages face\u000a      extinction in the near term, and it is essential to collect as much data\u000a      as possible while speakers of the languages are still available; (ii)\u000a      numerous under-documented languages have never been written and hence have\u000a      no established orthography, the development of which is essential when\u000a      building the database as well as for all other literary efforts; (iii)\u000a      freely available databases allow for verification of theoretical and\u000a      analytical claims about a language on the basis of primary data; (iv)\u000a      properly organised and archived data constitute a solid basis for future\u000a      research on the language. Recording and preserving a comprehensive range\u000a      of primary language data is a vital component of linguists' response to\u000a      the threat of extinction of more than half of the world's languages.\u000a    Like many languages of West Papua, Biak is under-researched, and the UNESCO\u000a        Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger classifies it as\u000a      \"vulnerable\". Only a few written texts were available before Dalrymple and\u000a      Mofu's work, and no audio or video samples existed. Steinhauer (2005)\u000a      provides a very brief sketch of Biak grammar, but no texts; a longer\u000a      description in Indonesian, with a transcribed but unanalysed text, is\u000a      given by Rumbrawer &amp; Fautngil (2002). Two dissertations on the grammar\u000a      of Biak have recently appeared: van den Heuvel (2006) includes an appendix\u000a      with 4 short Biak texts (about 4,000-5,000 words), and Mofu (2009)\u000a      includes appendices containing 7 annotated texts (about 40,000 words). All\u000a      of these are transcribed texts with no accompanying audio or video files.\u000a      In contrast, the database developed at Oxford consists of a more variable\u000a      and larger sample of Biak material including oral texts in Biak, including\u000a      songs, stories, jokes, monologues, and conversations, including\u000a      representative samples from each Biak-speaking area (North, South, East,\u000a      and West Biak including sub-dialects, Numfor Island, East Biak Highland,\u000a      and Sor). The project collected 64 spoken texts, which are all available\u000a      on the project website in the form of digitised audio or video files. For\u000a      23 of these texts, they provide transcriptions (a total of 12358 words),\u000a      translations into English and Indonesian, and morphological analyses of\u000a      the words in the texts, as well as XML-tagged text in computer-readable\u000a      and computer-searchable form. They also provide a glossary of all words\u000a      and affixes for the entire text collection.\u000a    These texts provide the basis for current and future research into Biak\u000a      phonology, syntax, and semantics, and they help to address research\u000a      questions such as dialect variation. The data demonstrate conclusively\u000a      that there are no morphological or syntactic differences among varieties\u000a      of Biak, though there is a great deal of phonological variation. The audio\u000a      database permits cataloguing of this variation, and will form the basis of\u000a      efforts to reconstruct earlier stages of the language and its relation to\u000a      other Austronesian languages of the region.\u000a    Based on the database, their research has covered the following issues:\u000a    \u000a      Biak nominal complementation can be marked in various ways on the\u000a        clause final auxiliary verb, and previous work on this construction had\u000a        not managed to untangle the semantic differences among the various\u000a        complementation types. This work provides a taxonomy of complementation\u000a        types and a clear explanation of their syntax and semantics. [2]\u000a\u000a      \u000a      Biak marks inalienable possession (involving, for example, body parts\u000a        or family members) by means of morphological marking on the head noun,\u000a        and alienable possession (involving acquired items) by means of marking\u000a        for both the possessor and the possessed item on the determiner. These\u000a        different morphological realisations of the possession relation are\u000a        shown to be very similar at an abstract syntactic level. This work\u000a        throws light on the syntax of possessive marking and how it relates to\u000a        meaning differences involving possession. [3]\u000a\u000a      \u000a      Our texts have formed the basis of research on the semantics of number\u000a        in Biak [4]. Biak distinguishes 4 numbers (singular, dual,\u000a        paucal, plural). Our texts reveal that the dual and paucal numbers\u000a        always have a definite interpretation, and that the paucal refers to\u000a        three or more entities, while the use of the plural requires reference\u000a        to at least four entities. This contradicts claims in the theoretical\u000a        literature on plurality that the plural form can always be used to refer\u000a        to two or more entities. This research adds to Dalrymple's focus on\u000a        semantics of number in other languages such as Indonesian [5],\u000a        leading to another Leverhulme Research Fellowship granted to her in\u000a        2012-13.\u000a    \u000a    Overall, the success of this project led to the award of Leverhulme\u000a      funding to Dalrymple (2010-11) for the documentation of Dusner, another\u000a      endangered language of Papua.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4895","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    For Tunstall and Warman the radical Enlightenment agenda was always about\u000a      reaching beyond an elite group of highly-educated, highly-privileged\u000a      individuals to bring education, awareness, and self-determination to as\u000a      many people as possible, in as many different ways as possible.

The book takes the\u000a      discussions even further - and there are lots of other areas covered too.'\u000a      (Comment by `miss reader', 5 October 2011). [i]\u000a    Caroline Warman received an invitation, based on her research, to be a\u000a      guest on Melvyn Bragg's series `In Our Time' aired on BBC Radio 4. The\u000a      series discusses the history of ideas and Warman contributed to programmes\u000a      on `Materialism' (24 April 2008) and `Voltaire's Candide' (3 May\u000a      2012). Live listening figures were 2.1 million, and the programmes remain\u000a      accessible on the BBC Radio iPlayer. The BBC public enjoyed and were\u000a      stimulated by her contribution: `it was great listening to your take of\u000a      randomness and complexities!!! Absolutely incredible!'. By communicating\u000a      in a lively and enthusiastic way, Dr Warman sparked the interest of\u000a      listeners unfamiliar with the topic: `Caroline Warman [...] was absolutely\u000a      sparkling, speaking with wonderful excitement in her voice!'; `My question\u000a      is prompted by a discussion colleague's comment below. We are both\u000a      untrained in philosophy' [ii]\u000a    Warman and Tunstall co-wrote and co-presented four programmes exploring\u000a      the life and work of Diderot for the Radio 3 series `The Essay:\u000a      Enlightenment Voices' (broadcast Radio 3, 19-22 January 2010, with\u000a      listening figures of 202,000[1]). Enlightenment Voices\u000a      was a mini-series introducing the great scientists, thinkers and activists\u000a      of the European Enlightenment. The Oxford researchers not only introduced\u000a      Diderot and his work to the listeners but `playfully challenged the\u000a      listener to grapple with this quintessentially Enlightenment subject\u000a      themselves' according to the BBC website description. One listener\u000a      commented: `Elucidators of the Enlightenment were never so informative and\u000a      so chirpy all at once'. Regular radio listeners were enthused and inspired\u000a      by the programmes `We overhear a lot of radio, particularly since the\u000a      advent of the iPlayer, but we can hardly recall any previous programmes of\u000a      such infectious enthusiasm...' [iii]Invitations to\u000a      broadcast or to give public lectures provide further proof that producers\u000a      and organisers consider their contribution to be reliably entertaining and\u000a      instructive. Tunstall and Warman widely communicate their research on the\u000a      debates of the French Enlightenment to enhance and enrich the public\u000a      discourse on modern society, its roots, its failings and tensions, and of\u000a      the experience of the individual within it. Dr Warman has spoken at\u000a      various non-academic events in recent years. This has allowed her to share\u000a      ideas and engage with participants about Enlightenment figures and\u000a      debates. She spoke about Charri&#232;re in Jane Austen's home at Chawton[iv]\u000a      as part of a public lecture series (attendance 40, Jan 2010), and about\u000a      Sade to the Last Tuesday Society in Hackney (attendance 40, October 2012).\u000a    Tunstall's work has also impacted on people with or involved with sensory\u000a      disabilities and those engaged in human rights issues. Based on her book Blindness\u000a        and Enlightenment: An Essay, Kate Tunstall discussed Diderot's Letter\u000a        on the Blind for the Use of Those who can See at a multi-media\u000a      performance, `Land of Silence and Darkness: Four Days of Talk and Action\u000a      connecting Movies, Blindness, Drawing, Perception and Neuroscience',\u000a      organised by the artist, Anna Lucas (Oxford, various locations, 14-17 May\u000a      2008).[v]Her talk engaged the audience in questions of\u000a      art, science and cognitive deprivation (attendance 40). The event\u000a      encouraged participation by people with sensory impairments and Kate's\u000a      talk was sign-language interpreted for the deaf. Tunstall's work has\u000a      influenced the understanding of those working with visually impaired\u000a      people. For example she was contacted by a dancer, who teaches tango to\u000a      people with visual impairment and is interested in the relationship\u000a      between vision and touch in dancing. She had read Blindness and\u000a        Enlightenment and felt compelled to write \"I often had ideas that\u000a      somehow could not provide evidence for, but your book is giving me so many\u000a      [...] I am not an academic, I like to back my artistic process with lots\u000a      of reading...\" [2]\u000a    Tunstall's research and its communication has impacted on civil society,\u000a      in relation to illuminating and challenging cultural values and social\u000a      assumptions relating to human rights. Tunstall is a Director of Oxford\u000a      Amnesty Lectures (OAL), created to sustain debate about human rights\u000a      through annual lectures by international speakers. Average attendance\u000a      figures are 150-200 per lecture. Based on her Enlightenment research\u000a      Tunstall developed the 2010 series, on Human Rights and the Enlightenment,\u000a      with speakers exploring the historical contexts from which human rights\u000a      emerged, and their status as truths, today[vi]. All\u000a      profits from Oxford Amnesty Lectures ticket sales and book sales are\u000a      donated to Amnesty International. To date, since 1992 OAL has raised over\u000a      &#163;108,000 for Amnesty International UK Charitable Trust.\u000a    Through a determination to publish their research in popular presses (e.g.\u000a    Penguin, Bloomsbury) and their extensive translation of key French texts\u000a    from and about the Enlightenment, Warman and Tunstall have provided\u000a    non-academic audiences with unique opportunities for cultural enrichment\u000a    through increased accessibility. Tunstall conceptualised and edited the\u000a    book, Self-Evident Truths (Bloomsbury 2012), which brought together\u000a    texts by an unusual range of interdisciplinary academics and non-academics\u000a    (a poet, a journalist, and a psychoanalyst) based on the OAL 2010 lecture\u000a    series. She selected Bloomsbury as the publisher, to market the book to a\u000a    wider public audience. One the back cover Chris Bertram, Professor of Social\u000a    and Political Philosophy, University of Bristol, UK says: `This volume\u000a    exemplifies how the Oxford Amnesty Lectures not only reflect but also enrich\u000a    the debate on human rights in the contemporary world. This is a sparkling\u000a    set of essays that illuminate the problematic and ambiguous legacy of the\u000a    Enlightenment and the enduring tensions between slogans of universal liberty\u000a    and the lived human experience of its pursuit and enforcement, between\u000a    securing the conditions of democratic conversation and upholding individual\u000a    rights.' Blindness and Enlightenment has also provoked eloquent\u000a    testimonials from readers, one of whom was herself going blind: she emailed\u000a    to say `You made a subject that can often be heavy going and dreary into a\u000a    wonderful read, and I almost yelled aloud in the reading room when I found\u000a    it.' [3]\u000a    New translations by Warman and Tunstall have enabled readers to discover\u000a      literature on French Enlightenment, previously unreadable by\u000a      non-francophone audiences. Tunstall's translation of Diderot's Letter\u000a        on the Blind is the first since 1770 and of La Mothe Le Vayer's\u000a      essay `Of a Man Born Blind', the first translation ever; Warman's\u000a      translation of 9 novellas by Charriere is the first wide-reaching\u000a      translation since 1925 of 4 of the stories, and the first translation ever\u000a      of 5 of them.\u000a    Tunstall and Warman selected, edited, and translated 11 articles written\u000a      in French by the eminent Enlightenment scholar Marian Hobson, and their\u000a      version is now being translated into Chinese.[4] There\u000a      is great demand for this type of material in China but it is difficult to\u000a      translate from French. By translating the text into English, Warman and\u000a      Tunstall have enabled this further translation and the inclusion of this\u000a      work in the Chinese market. The Nobleman and Other Romances,\u000a      translated by Warman has been widely publicised by the publisher, Penguin,\u000a      with 2000 literature professors in the USA being offered free examination\u000a      copies. The publisher anticipates the book will be incorporated in college\u000a      reading lists within 2-3 semesters.[5]\u000a    There is continuous evidence throughout the submission period of their\u000a      continuing commitment to take their research beyond the academic sphere.\u000a      The forms their contributions take are varied and inventive, and their\u000a      translations and radio programmes look set to continue to provoke interest\u000a      over the coming years.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Tunstall and Warman bring the debates of the French Enlightenment to the\u000a      public, and make them accessible and meaningful through lively and\u000a      enjoyable discussion on radio, television, and public lecture. By so\u000a      doing, they significantly enhance and enrich the public understanding of\u000a      modern society, its roots, its failings and tensions, and of the\u000a      experience of the individual within it.

They share two key\u000a      insights: firstly, that French thinkers provocatively extend and test John\u000a      Locke's famous theory that knowledge comes from the senses and from\u000a      experience (An Essay concerning human understanding, 1689), and\u000a      secondly, that the literary forms these tests take are as important as\u000a      their philosophical content.\u000a    Their research focuses on the way French Enlightenment writers use\u000a      individual points of view to assess the nature of an individual's sensory\u000a      and experiential knowledge. They are interested in how French empiricists\u000a      probe empiricism from within. Denis Diderot, writer and editor of the Encyclop&#233;die,\u000a      looks at what it means for a blind person to receive knowledge through\u000a      only four senses[1], what it means for a celebrated geometer\u000a      who is thinking so hard he isn't paying attention to any sensory stimuli[2],\u000a      or what the implications for this theory of knowledge are for someone\u000a      physiologically identical but culturally completely different[3].\u000a      He also looks at what it means for those in authority to spy on individual\u000a      experience[4] to extend their own knowledge. Isabelle de\u000a      Charri&#232;re uses fiction to explore the point of view of women, in\u000a      possession of their senses as much as their brothers, and therefore with\u000a      as much knowledge, and yet with many fewer ways of reaching fulfilment[5].\u000a      The shocking pornographer Sade takes the premise that knowledge comes from\u000a      the senses and restates that the sensation itself is the knowledge, and\u000a      that therefore the more intense the sensation is, the more knowledge it\u000a      provides. The result is unacceptable morally and socially, but is as\u000a      tightly related to Lockean theories of sensory-based knowledge as anything\u000a      Diderot or Charri&#232;re wrote[6], and indeed much of what they\u000a      wrote was also too challenging to be accepted. Tunstall and Warman are\u000a      interested in pursuing why this was so, and in charting the forms taken by\u000a      challenges to established thinking.\u000a    In contrast to much Enlightenment scholarship that is best characterized\u000a      as history of ideas, Tunstall and Warman place as much emphasis on\u000a      questions of style, genre and format as on the ideas that the texts\u000a      contain. How do the various Enlightenment conceptions of the relationship\u000a      between truth, knowledge and the human body find themselves represented in\u000a      texts? And how do the texts themselves mobilize particular forms and\u000a      formats to instruct their readers? Tunstall and Warman offer an in-depth\u000a      analysis of these texts, to see how these writers, Diderot especially, use\u000a      writing, its blind spots, and extravagant claims, to look at the\u000a      limitations of any particular perspective, in particular any claim to\u000a      superiority. This research has led them to ask what, if anything, is left\u000a      of the Enlightenment phrase `rights of man' in modern human rights\u000a      discourse, and to ask what might be gained for the public understanding of\u000a      that discourse by retrieving its Enlightenment heritage more fully. These\u000a      questions are explicitly asked in Tunstall's edited collection Self-Evident\u000a        Truths? (2012).\u000a    They have been engaged in research on the literature and thought of the\u000a      French Enlightenment since their appointments at Oxford (Tunstall at\u000a      Worcester College in 1997, and Warman at Jesus College in 2005). Their\u000a      intellectual and geographical proximity, and the support provided by their\u000a      institutions and by the Maison Fran&#231;aise d'Oxford, combine to give much\u000a      added impetus to their work. Both contribute to the Voltaire Foundation's\u000a      Besterman Centre for Research on the Enlightenment; Tunstall was its\u000a      Programme Director from 2008 to 2011.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4896","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact claimed in this study arises from the production and public\u000a      availability of the corpus's texts and spoken audio in a variety of media\u000a      - CD-ROM, DVD, and on-line - together with associated documentation,\u000a      publications and access software. The consortium also published SARA, a\u000a      concordance tool for search and analysis of the BNC.\u000a    An estimated 2000 full licences (both personal and institutional\u000a      licences) and 1800 copies of BNC Baby (a 4 million word sample of the full\u000a      BNC) have been sold world wide since 2008. In addition, our Japanese\u000a      distributor has distributed over 350 licences in the relevant period. [&#167;5i]\u000a    The impacts have been:\u000a    1) A contribution to United Kingdom's cultural heritage. A\u000a      century ago Oxford University researched and published the authoritative\u000a      Oxford English Dictionary, based upon written texts. The 100-million-word\u000a      British National Corpus (10 million spoken words) is a documentary record\u000a      of written and spoken English representing a wide cross-section of British\u000a      English, at the end of the 20th century.\u000a    2) For dictionary makers, the BNC improves and adds value to\u000a      their products, providing a unique selling point over their competitors,\u000a      and enhancing educational value to purchasers of their dictionaries. The\u000a      corpus was used by the dictionary publishers making up the original\u000a      consortium: OUP, Longman and Chambers, in creating the Longman Dictionary\u000a      of Contemporary English, the Chambers 21st Century Dictionary, and the\u000a      Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary.\u000a    \u000a      Longman Dictionaries' website states: \"What is so unique about the\u000a        Spoken Corpus is that it shows us how we really use English, not how we\u000a        are supposed to use English or how we use it when we are writing. It\u000a        reveals how very different the spoken word is from the written word. At\u000a        last students will be able to study English in an exciting new range of\u000a        ELT materials that represent English as it really is. For the first\u000a        time, real spoken language has influenced the creation of a learner\u000a        dictionary.\"\u000a      Chambers 21st Century Dictionary claims \"All Chambers dictionaries are\u000a        supported by the British National Corpus, a 100-million-word database of\u000a        written and spoken English that provides real evidence of how English is\u000a        used.\"\u000a      The Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionaries website says \"We use the\u000a        BNC to confirm our intuitions and also to tell us things we didn't\u000a        already know, or may not have thought about. We can find out exactly\u000a        what a word means, rather than what we think it means. We can see how it\u000a        behaves grammatically and which words it collocates with. We use all\u000a        this information when writing our learners` dictionaries.\"\u000a    \u000a    Since 2011, the Government of India (Central Institute of Indian\u000a      Languages) has been collaborating with Longman Pearson to create bilingual\u000a      dictionaries in English and eleven Indian languages. The English part has\u000a      been developed using words and phrases culled from the BNC. According to\u000a      the Project manager of the National Translation Mission \"The lexicon is an\u000a      important translation tool - kind of a spring board to push the mother\u000a      tongues, many of which are threatened with very few speakers\". [&#167;5ii]\u000a    David Crystal's chapter `Essential Grammar' for English language learners\u000a      in The Longman Essential Activator draws on the BNC for examples of\u000a      real-life English usage to help intermediate learners to better understand\u000a      how to use grammar in written and spoken English. [&#167;5iii]\u000a    3) English language teachers world-wide, and the agencies that\u000a      examine them, have better examples of contemporary spoken English to use\u000a      in their studies, improving the standards of teaching and learning of\u000a      English as a Foreign Language.\u000a    In comments sent to researchers via the BNC registration page, Juan, an\u000a      English teacher in Spain says he uses the recordings in his class so that\u000a      his students become aware of the different accents in the UK. Another\u000a      teacher uses it \"for my students to practise repeating after the tapes to\u000a      improve their pronunciation.\" Tdol, an English teacher in Japan, refers\u000a      language users to the BNC (20\/3\/2008). A blog post by Monica Vlad, a\u000a      language teacher from Romania recommends language learners consult the BNC\u000a      to check on questions of usage \"in a few easy steps without having to\u000a      google endlessly and end up with some website or forum results &#8212; you can`t\u000a      really know how reliable they are.\"[iv] Other such comments from\u000a      BNC user registrations demonstrate the reasons they are using it and the\u000a      impact it has on improving teaching and learning of English as a foreign\u000a      language:\u000a    \u000a      \"Teaching English to Swedish students, exposing them to a range of\u000a        accents.\"\u000a      \"As a teacher of English, for personal reasons, so as to check doubts\u000a        about collocation, use... but also for professional reasons.\"\u000a      \"I am in English teacher in Spain and would like to use the recordings\u000a        in my class so that my students become aware of the different accents in\u000a        the UK.\"\u000a      \"I could use [the recordings] as authentic listening exercises\u000a        especially with regard to different accents.\"\u000a      \"looking for recording by natives for my students\"\u000a    \u000a    4) The BNC provides English language learners with access to\u000a      copious audio and text examples from an authoritative source which they\u000a      can use to become familiar with variation in English and to improve their\u000a      own British English pronunciation and usage, supporting independent study.\u000a      The BNC site registration records provide evidence that the spoken audio\u000a      is used by learners for purposes such as \"to know how to pronounce words\u000a      and practice how to listen them within the context\", \"to refresh my\u000a      English\", \"to learn more about British English\", \"to know how to pronounce\u000a      words and practice how to listen them within the context\", \"just listen to\u000a      refresh my English; it has been too long since I could talk to native\u000a      speakers and listen to spoken English at large\" and \"I want to improve my\u000a      English by listening to these audio files\".\u000a    5) The OCR school examinations board are using extracts of BNC\u000a      conversation transcriptions originally published on the Phonetics\u000a      Laboratory website in order to improve the quality of public examinations,\u000a      and since March 2013 have been selling copies of the exam papers.[&#167;5v]\u000a      Analysis of natural English conversation is a key part of the English\u000a      Language GCSE and A-level curricula.\u000a    6) People all over the world with access to the internet use the\u000a      BNC as an authoritative reference on English, without having to pay for it\u000a      or buy dictionaries or other reference works. This has widened access to\u000a      accurate information about present-day UK English. Many individual writers\u000a      use BNC as a reference source relevant to questions of contemporary\u000a      English usage. It is a superior resource in comparison with other online\u000a      sources: Jonathan de Boyne Pollard claims BNC can be a more accurate\u000a      source of word frequencies than Google hit counts.[&#167;5vi]\u000a    To demonstrate an estimate of the internet reach of the BNC, the search\u000a      term British National Corpus yields 2.18 million hits on Google UK (cf.\u000a      the 1.3m hits for their closest UK competitor, the Edinburgh map task\u000a      corpus. The Google search engine lists over 80,000 blog posts and over\u000a      17,000 discussions citing British National Corpus.

The\u000d\u000a      conference provided a unique opportunity for a multidisciplinary,\u000d\u000a      international group of academic\u000d\u000a      researchers and healthcare practitioners to consider why retelling\u000d\u000a      familiar tales is so important to\u000d\u000a      the anticipation, event, and memory of birth. The conference examined the\u000d\u000a      use of birthing tales in\u000d\u000a      media such as drama and online forums; how fiction has historically\u000d\u000a      addressed new issues,\u000d\u000a      including donor-conceived children's need for tales of their birth; the\u000d\u000a      spaces afforded in different\u000d\u000a      societies (1950s England, present-day India) to the male birthing partner\u000d\u000a      and the dhoulla; and how\u000d\u000a      healthcare affects the bonding between mother and child (in relation to\u000d\u000a      contemporary community\u000d\u000a      midwifery in Germany, and to historic attitudes to the surgical\u000d\u000a      termination of ectopic pregnancies).\u000d\u000a    Midwives are reflective practitioners in the technical sense of\u000d\u000a      reflection as one of the main learning\u000d\u000a      methods endorsed by professional, statutory and regulatory bodies (the\u000d\u000a      National Medical Council\u000d\u000a      and the Royal College of Midwives) to promote the development of\u000d\u000a      knowledgeable and competent\u000d\u000a      practitioners; hence the midwives' attendance at the conference was a\u000d\u000a      formative part of their\u000d\u000a      professional development. They particularly valued the opportunity to\u000d\u000a      reflect on their current\u000d\u000a      practice within a comparative historic context: e.g. why, in popular\u000d\u000a      imagination (from Antiquity to\u000d\u000a      the age of the internet), births at eight months paradoxically generate\u000d\u000a      more fear than those at\u000d\u000a      seven months; how the language used by different parties (mothers,\u000d\u000a      midwives, surgeons,\u000d\u000a      physicians) to describe the female reproductive system can be symptomatic\u000d\u000a      of conflicting attitudes.\u000d\u000a      The historical prism afforded by Worth-Stylianou's research, and that of\u000d\u000a      the various speakers,\u000d\u000a      allowed the midwives and primary carers to reflect on their experiences\u000d\u000a      from a fresh and\u000d\u000a      stimulating angle, so that contemporary debates (e.g. the role of the\u000d\u000a      dhoulla as distinct from the\u000d\u000a      midwife, the use of retelling tales \/ drama as a therapy for postnatal\u000d\u000a      stress) could be\u000d\u000a      recontextualised. Those midwives in leadership roles (e.g. university\u000d\u000a      lecturers in midwifery, senior\u000d\u000a      community midwives) recognised that the experiences of history &#8212; both in\u000d\u000a      terms of continuity and\u000d\u000a      of change &#8212; would provide very useful support and material for reflection\u000d\u000a      for the teaching of current\u000d\u000a      practice to their midwifery students. The dissemination of discussions\u000d\u000a      around international\u000d\u000a      historical and contemporary ethical issues was another significant\u000d\u000a      achievement, which participants\u000d\u000a      took back to places as diverse as the Department of Ethics in Mangalore,\u000d\u000a      the community midwives\u000d\u000a      of the Ruhr area in Germany, or those researching on the identity of\u000d\u000a      donor-conceived children in\u000d\u000a      the Department of Political and Social Sciences, Fiesole.\u000d\u000a    An attendee who was formerly the General Secretary of the Royal College\u000d\u000a      of Midwives [1]\u000d\u000a      commented: `The conference was a great success in terms of bringing\u000d\u000a      together practitioners and\u000d\u000a      academics from all over the world who might otherwise not have found a\u000d\u000a      forum to exchange ideas.\u000d\u000a      This can only serve to advance thinking and argument especially for those\u000d\u000a      academics whose\u000d\u000a      background is grounded in practice.' A Midwifery Lecturer at Manchester\u000d\u000a      University [2] thought that\u000d\u000a      `The event facilitated networking opportunities between academics and\u000d\u000a      practitioners, and has\u000d\u000a      assisted with the dissemination of the presenters' research to wider\u000d\u000a      audiences.' These comments\u000d\u000a      demonstrate the impact of combining academics and practitioners in the\u000d\u000a      conference and the\u000d\u000a      collective learning experience achieved. The Director, Centre for Ethics,\u000d\u000a      Yenepoya University,\u000d\u000a      Mangalore, India [3] said afterwards: `One of the best summer\u000d\u000a      schools I have attended. It was truly\u000d\u000a      Interdisciplinary in nature with experts from different backgrounds\u000d\u000a      bringing rich experiences that\u000d\u000a      helped us crystallise our perceptions. The presentations were of high\u000d\u000a      quality and made an impact\u000d\u000a      on the audience. Coming from a developing country like India, due to a\u000d\u000a      Wellcome travel grant [...] I\u000d\u000a      was able to attend and be a part of the rich exchange of Ideas. I think\u000d\u000a      this momentum should not\u000d\u000a      be lost, but rather be the epicentre from where more such workshops should\u000d\u000a      emerge'.\u000d\u000a    Following the Oxford conference, Worth-Stylianou was invited to deliver\u000d\u000a      the keynote lecture in\u000d\u000a      Manchester in May 2013 at the annual meeting of De Partu (the UK\u000d\u000a      association for the study of the\u000d\u000a      history of midwifery).

Her 2007 critical\u000d\u000a      bibliography (Droz) of some 20 key obstetrical or gynaecological texts\u000d\u000a      received excellent reviews,\u000d\u000a      and was recently described as `invaluable' (Kirk Read, Birthing Bodies\u000d\u000a        in early modern France\u000d\u000a      (Ashgate, 2012), p.7). Since October 2009, she has collaborated fruitfully\u000d\u000a      with the large group of\u000d\u000a      early modern French specialists in Oxford (notably Professor Ian Maclean\u000d\u000a      and Dr Wes Williams),\u000d\u000a      and has drawn on Oxford's rich early modern library holdings principally\u000d\u000a      to undertake research on\u000d\u000a      birthing tales in France.\u000d\u000a    During 2009-10, Worth-Stylianou undertook research, in preparation for\u000d\u000a      the compilation of a\u000d\u000a      bilingual research website on birthing tales in early modern French\u000d\u000a      medical texts [1]. The research\u000d\u000a      established the sharp growth in frequency of individual case histories of\u000d\u000a      births in medical works in\u000d\u000a      French in the16th and earlier 17th centuries, departing from the tendency\u000d\u000a      in earlier medical works\u000d\u000a      to treat generic diseases or conditions rather than particular\u000d\u000a      manifestations of them, and confirming\u000d\u000a      the rise of the case history in this period. It also demonstrates that\u000d\u000a      some elite surgeons and one\u000d\u000a      court midwife collected and published case histories, and that two\u000d\u000a      subjects dominate birthing tales:\u000d\u000a      the interest in monstrous births (c.1560-1590) and the fascination with\u000d\u000a      detailed anatomical\u000d\u000a      descriptions, exemplifying non-specialist readers' engagement with medical\u000d\u000a      discoveries in the\u000d\u000a      nascent field of embryology. The Birthing Tales website establishes ways\u000d\u000a      in which tales of birth in\u000d\u000a      medical texts in French c.1500-1630 represent birth as at once a universal\u000d\u000a      and a unique\u000d\u000a      experience. Key research questions answered on the site include: how far\u000d\u000a      the professional\u000d\u000a      allegiances of authors influence the accounts of birth; how the putative\u000d\u000a      readership influences the\u000d\u000a      style and nature of the writing; and what evidence birthing tales provide\u000d\u000a      of key social and medical\u000d\u000a      debates, and of evolutions in medical practice and social attitudes.\u000d\u000a    Case histories and interactions between health professionals, family and\u000d\u000a      friends are also central to\u000d\u000a      Pregnancy and Birth in Early Modern France [2],\u000d\u000a      Worth-Stylianou's study and English translation of\u000d\u000a      the works of four physicians and a surgeon. The work appears in the series\u000d\u000a      `Other Voices in Early\u000d\u000a      Modern Europe', Toronto University Press, noted for offering cultural\u000d\u000a      enrichment by making texts\u000d\u000a      available to an English-speaking readership through scholarly translations\u000d\u000a      and editions. The\u000d\u000a      volume pinpoints the speed and frequency of changes in medical and\u000d\u000a      surgical practice, and\u000d\u000a      revises previous assumptions, notably proving that skilled male surgeons\u000d\u000a      attended some normal\u000d\u000a      deliveries of elite women in Paris as early as 1600-1610.\u000d\u000a      Worth-Stylianou's translations give\u000d\u000a      insights into rivalries between different professional groupings\u000d\u000a      (physicians and surgeons, surgeons\u000d\u000a      and midwives, midwives and unskilled attendants), but also furnish less\u000d\u000a      well-known instances of\u000d\u000a      co-operative networks. The book and the website testify to the important\u000d\u000a      shared or liminal space\u000d\u000a      between medical and literary writings; in this respect, the research\u000d\u000a      provides an important corollary\u000d\u000a      and testing-point for some recent studies which examined ways early modern\u000d\u000a      French fiction drew\u000d\u000a      on medical writings to depict birth.\u000d\u000a    Worth-Stylianou's research uses comparative historical analysis to\u000d\u000a      engender interdisciplinary\u000d\u000a      reflection by both academics and healthcare practitioners on contemporary\u000d\u000a      practice and attitudes.\u000d\u000a      Her article (`The definition of obscene material', 2010 [3]) on\u000d\u000a      some of the earliest charges of\u000d\u000a      obscenity leveled against printed materials in France, draws parallels\u000d\u000a      with the psycholinguistic\u000d\u000a      framework Pinker proposes for contemporary understanding of the affective\u000d\u000a      charge of obscenity.\u000d\u000a      Her study (`La th&#233;&#226;trilisation', 2010 [4]) of the midwife's and\u000d\u000a      the royal doctor's reports of the birth of\u000d\u000a      the future Louis XIII, identifies an early struggle for power in the\u000d\u000a      birthing-chamber.

MPI has become a dynamic forum for the non-academic crime\u000a      fiction community to interact (readers, bloggers, authors, translators,\u000a      publishers, cultural commentators), and in the process has generated very\u000a      significant interest and activity. It has global reach, with users\u000a      from over 130 countries, and is hosted by 'Mrs. Peabody', a\u000a      friendly persona encouraging maximum user-participation. Its posts have\u000a      generated over 220,000 hits (average 6,500\/month, 1,500\/week,\u000a      225\/day) and over 2,500 comments (WordPress statistics;\u000a      blog-curator's hits excluded, C2).\u000a    MPI is built around two novel innovations: a researcher `opening up' her\u000a      on-going critical reflections on emergent crime fiction genres to a wide\u000a      audience, and making accessible a growing database of research texts (C3).\u000a      Over 50 'Detecting\u000a        the Past' texts are examined in the blog (click hyperlinks in C3 for\u000a      relevant posts), showcasing Nazi-themed and German\/European\/international\u000a      crime. Dr Hall's academic expertise underpins reviews, themed posts,\u000a      author interviews, and conference\/ convention reports, with users invited\u000a      to access the project database and research articles on MPI's\u000a        'About' page and in relevant\u000a        posts. Blog discussions involving readers, bloggers, authors,\u000a      translators and publishers (such as Bitter Lemon, MacLehose and Hersilia\u000a      Press) explore crime fiction's capacity to offer\u000a      social\/political\/historical critiques, and core themes such as guilt and\u000a      justice. The quality of debate is often extremely high and incorporates\u000a      discussion of Nazi-themed and European texts (see threads on 'Violence\u000a        and Women in Crime', 'Would\u000a        the real Finland please\u000a        stand up', 'Arne\u000a        Dahl', and `Philip\u000a        Kerr').\u000a    MPI is a mutually beneficial space for the blogger and its users. By\u000a      discussing texts iteratively with a highly motivated non-academic\u000a      audience, Dr Hall has captured a host of new insights about the production\u000a      and reception of crime fiction that inform her research. Non-academic\u000a      impacts are also significant and include the following:\u000a    \u000a      By sharing her critical reflections on high-quality crime fiction, Dr.\u000a        Hall has had a notable impact on user reading practices. In a\u000a        July 2013 user-survey (C4), over half of the respondents\u000a        felt that their `reading habits had been influenced or changed by the\u000a          blog'. Comments include: `introduced to many new European crime\u000a          writers'; `pointed towards writers, particularly German, that I\u000a          might not otherwise have encountered'; `have read a lot more\u000a          since following Mrs P'; `have become more adventurous in what\u000a          crime fiction I read'; `have purchased titles I wouldn't have\u000a          done without your recommendation' (Users 1-5, C4).\u000a      \u000aUsers' lives are enriched by Dr Hall's expert interpretation of\u000a          cultural capital. 85% of survey respondents felt that `the\u000a        blogger's academic expertise adds value to the blog' and 70%\u000a        that `the blog introduces me to crime fiction that enriches my life'.\u000a        Comments include: `I really appreciate MPI. There are many book\u000a          blogs, but this one really stands out in terms of the quality of its\u000a          reviews. The fact that the blogger is an academic is very apparent in\u000a          the breadth and depth of the analysis'; `I enjoy the blog\u000a          because it is more than a compendium of reviews.

(Users 6 and 7, C4).\u000a      Crime is often consumed unreflexively as entertainment. MPI has successfully\u000a          encouraged users to explore the thematic and ethical complexity of the\u000a          genre more deeply: `I feel encouraged to be an active reader,\u000a          drawing comparisons with other crime novels\/films rather than simply\u000a          reading the text for the story'; `I've learned new ways to\u000a          think about crime fiction'; MPI `has made me think differently\u000a          about crime novels I've read' (Users 8-10, C4); `Mrs.\u000a          Peabody's analysis encouraged me to read the book, as she dealt with\u000a          critical moral questions that arose during WWII and its aftermath'\u000a        (User 11, `Reactions\u000a          to Reading' blog, June 2013).\u000a    \u000a    Cumulatively, Dr Hall has had an impact on wider public discourses about\u000a      crime fiction. By creating so much informed dialogue and debate through\u000a      her blog, she has influenced how discussion about crime fiction is framed\u000a      in more mainstream media. In October\/November 2012 she contributed to two\u000a      episodes of Mark Lawson's BBC\u000a          Radio 4 series, Foreign Bodies: A History of Modern Europe\u000a      through Literary\u000a          Detectives (C5), in which she explored the engagement\u000a      of Friedrich D&#252;rrenmatt's and Jakob Arjouni's crime fiction with the\u000a      legacy of National Socialism (aired between World at One and The\u000a        Archers; Radio 4's weekly audience figures for the fourth quarter of\u000a      2012: 10.75 million (BBC\/RAJAR),\u000a      C6). In 2013 Dr Hall was invited to judge the international Petrona\u000a      crime fiction award (C7), to contribute to The Times\u000a      crime-fiction critic's new Euro Noir book (C8), and to\u000a      attend a programming meeting with the Head of BBC Wales Drama. MPI's\u000a      companion Twitter\u000a    account (C9) has over 800 followers including a number of\u000a      crime writers (Ann Cleeves, Arne Dahl, Mons Kallentoft, Ernesto Mallo,\u000a      Derek B. Miller, Stuart Neville, Jason Webster), publishers\/publishing\u000a      contacts (Penguin Books; Bitter Lemon Press; Hersilia Press; MacLehose\u000a      Press; Alison Hennessy, Harvill Secker Commissioning Editor), and critics\u000a      (James Kidd\/Independent; Barry Forshaw\/The Times).

The support from these three\u000d\u000a        artists from Swansea University in recent years is therefore striking\u000d\u000a        and invaluable to Wales' largest cultural event.'\u000d\u000a    Only writers who have won the Crown, the Chair or the Prose Medal\u000d\u000a      competitions at the National Eisteddfod can be elected as Archdruid of\u000d\u000a      Wales. During the REF census period, Christine James had\u000d\u000a      previously been part of the Gair am Gelf (A Word about Art) project in\u000d\u000a      order to raise money for the 2008 National Eisteddfod at Cardiff, during\u000d\u000a      which she was also resident poet in Y Lle Celf (The Arts Space). However,\u000d\u000a      since her `historical' election as Archdruid in 2012 - the first woman and\u000d\u000a      the first academic to hold this position - James has engaged with the\u000d\u000a      public by means of talks to various cultural groups across Wales, from\u000d\u000a      Cardiff to Talsarnau, addressing both female and mixed audiences, but\u000d\u000a      mostly visiting areas where Welsh is not the main communal language. She\u000d\u000a      herself learnt the language and as reported by BBC Cymru\/Wales her vision\u000d\u000a      is to reach out to diverse communities. She was also the subject of a\u000d\u000a      special edition of Dechrau Canu, Dechrau Canmol on S4C (28.4.13)\u000d\u000a      and a special feature on BBC Radio Cymru (28.7.13).\u000d\u000a    When Fflur Dafydd won the Daniel Owen in 2009, the highlights on the day\u000d\u000a      attracted 44,000 viewers on S4C, which included an interview with Fflur\u000d\u000a      Dafydd. Similarly in 2010, when Tudur Hallam won the Chair competition,\u000d\u000a      the Eisteddfod's highlights of the day programme was viewed by 49,000\u000d\u000a      people. Both ceremonies were also broadcast and televised live. Interviews\u000d\u000a      and reports appeared in numerous national and local papers. Hallam's awdl\u000d\u000a      was included in the festival's Cyfansoddiadau a Beirniadaethau,\u000d\u000a      published by the Eisteddfod. As emphasized above, these ceremonies are\u000d\u000a      integral to the Eisteddfod's programme and public appeal.\u000d\u000a    Engaging with the National Library of Wales\u000d\u000a    In 2011, James contributed a poem on one of the treasures kept at the\u000d\u000a      National Library of Wales, translated into English and published in a\u000d\u000a      book, 26 Treasures: 4 National Museums, 104 Objects, 62 Words\u000d\u000a      (2012), and online at http:\/\/www.26treasures.com\/wales.\u000d\u000a      James promoted the project on Pethe on S4C, and in July 2013 was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the National Library of Wales to write a new poem for the\u000d\u000a      Four Ancient Books of Wales Exhibition, while another of her poems,\u000d\u000a      already published in Rhwng y Llinellau, has also been selected to\u000d\u000a      feature in the exhibition. These projects consolidate the creative link\u000d\u000a      between the UoA and the National Library formed by Fflur Dafydd's Y\u000d\u000a        Llyfrgell. The novel and Byd Bach were the subject of a talk\u000d\u000a      and song event by Dafydd at the Library (27.11.2009), and the subject also\u000d\u000a      of Y Sioe Gelf (22.11.2009), produced by Cwmni Da for S4C and\u000d\u000a      filmed at the Library. Published by Y Lolfa of Tal-y-bont, Y Llyfrgell\u000d\u000a      quickly became a bestseller. Wales Literature Exchange selected the novel\u000d\u000a      for its Bookshelf. This entailed international promotion and an author\u000d\u000a      interview in Transcript Magazine, subsequently translated into\u000d\u000a      French and German for an international audience. Literature Wales invited\u000d\u000a      Dafydd to host a literary tour of the National Library (13.7.2012).\u000d\u000a      Contemplating the novel's popularity, the National Library's Press Officer\u000d\u000a      (C2) has stated that `Y Llyfrgell has brought the National Library to\u000d\u000a        the forefront of people's minds in a new and exciting way, and the\u000d\u000a        literary tour at the Library proved a great success, allowing us to\u000d\u000a        respond to the public's interest in the novel's relationship with the\u000d\u000a        building. Such tours, along with exhibitions such as the Four Ancient\u000d\u000a        Books and projects such as 26 Treasures, allow us to present our\u000d\u000a        collections to new audiences.'\u000d\u000a    Working with diverse institutional and reader groups and Welsh-medium\u000d\u000a        broadcasters\u000d\u000a    Y Llyfrgell, produced by Y Lolfa of Tal-y-bont, became the\u000d\u000a      bestselling Welsh-language book for August 2009 and September 2009 (a\u000d\u000a      reprint was necessary within a month of its publication). It subsequently\u000d\u000a      won the Fiction Bestseller Award at the Trade Publishing Awards 2012,\u000d\u000a      having sold 3,738 copies. Sales figures, however, cannot convey how Fflur\u000d\u000a      Dafydd's work bridges the gap between literature and music. (Details of\u000d\u000a      media appearances and past live performances are listed on Dafydd's\u000d\u000a      web-site.) According to BBC Radio Cymru's editor (C3): `Fflur Dafydd is\u000d\u000a        one of BBC Radio Cymru's most played artists. Her work is an important\u000d\u000a        contribution to the musical content of the station's programmes, but the\u000d\u000a        Welsh language itself is also enriched through her songs.' In June\u000d\u000a      2012 she was invited by the world-renowned Telegraph Hay Festival to\u000d\u000a      launch Ffydd Gobaith Cariad in a special concert there at the\u000d\u000a      Sound Castle, supporting Cerys Matthews (C4).\u000d\u000a    James' numerous talks, since her appointment as Archdruid were mentioned\u000d\u000a      above. Both Dafydd and Hallam too, following their Eisteddfod success,\u000d\u000a      visited diverse groups to discuss their work, with audience numbers\u000d\u000a      varying from 10 to 90, including Welsh-medium schools, literary groups and\u000d\u000a      dinner or cultural societies, from Bangor University to Clwb Cinio\u000d\u000a      Glannau'r Llwchwr (Loughor Dinner Club). Both have also appeared on\u000d\u000a      television and radio programmes (e.g. Heno, Pethe, Dei\u000d\u000a        Tomos), including Dafydd's 3 Lle, produced by Apollo for S4C\u000d\u000a      (21.3.2010). Since winning the Chair, Hallam as Prifardd (Master Poet) has\u000d\u000a      also adjudicated for a number of local literary festivals and schools (the\u000d\u000a      Chaired Eisteddfod of Hendy, Bancffosfelen, Tumble, Llandyfaelog, Ysgol\u000d\u000a      Gyfun G&#373;yr), helping organisers `to attract competitors from afar'\u000d\u000a      as stated by the Secretary of the Tumble Chaired Eisteddfod (C5).\u000d\u000a    Commemoration\u000d\u000a    One of the largest audiences was at Cymdeithas y Llan a'r Bryn\u000d\u000a      (20.10.2010), the literary society established by Hywel Teifi Edwards in\u000d\u000a      Llangennech, the subject of `Ennill Tir' [R5]. The poem commemorates a\u000d\u000a      much loved national figure and prominent campaigner for the Welsh language\u000d\u000a      &#8212; a theme also present in Fflur Dafydd's Ffydd Gobaith Cariad,\u000d\u000a      including the tribute song to Ray Gravell performed at a special tribute\u000d\u000a      and sell-out concert, `Cofio Grav', at the Lyric Theatre, Carmarthen\u000d\u000a      (2.3.2008) (C6). The song was subsequently translated and performed in\u000d\u000a      English on BBC Radio Wales (2.6.2012). Both men were truly Welsh greats\u000d\u000a      and subjects of public commemoration in the media and in their\u000d\u000a      communities.\u000d\u000a    Idris Reynolds (C7) noted that ``Ennill Tir' is a beautiful tribute to\u000d\u000a        a giant of a man who gave so much to the Eisteddfod and to the nation',\u000d\u000a      and reference to the commemorative value of the awdl was made by\u000d\u000a      Hywel Francis, MP, in a parliamentary Early Day Motion (8.9.2010) (C8).\u000d\u000a      Work on an anthology of commemorative verse, Hoff Gerddi Coffa Cymru,\u000d\u000a      commenced in 2012, published by Gwasg Gomer (2013), and as stated by the\u000d\u000a      editor, the awdl was the `stimulus' for that book (C9).\u000d\u000a    In conclusion\u000d\u000a    Collectively the three artists here have engaged with a variety of fora\u000d\u000a      in Wales, enriching the lives of readers, listeners and viewers of Welsh\u000d\u000a      texts, programmes and events, as evidenced by qualitative quotations and\u000d\u000a      quantitative figures above. This engagement is truly diverse, ranging from\u000d\u000a      national festivals and televised interviews attracting large audiences, to\u000d\u000a      supporting the smallest cultural groups, who are nevertheless important to\u000d\u000a      their community's Welsh language culture. In the REF census period, all\u000d\u000a      three authors have developed their role as academics whose creative\u000d\u000a      writing impacts on the all important task of cultivating the cultural life\u000d\u000a      of Welsh.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Unit's creative writing has had an impact on Welsh language culture\u000d\u000a      by means of:\u000d\u000a    1) public engagement, especially at Wales' largest cultural festival, the\u000d\u000a      National Eisteddfod, including a best-selling novel which won the Daniel\u000d\u000a      Owen Memorial Prize (2009), a commemorative poem which won the Chair\u000d\u000a      (2010), and a historic appointment as Archdruid of Wales (2012), the first\u000d\u000a      time a woman has held this prestigious position.

All three adjudicators, who included\u000d\u000a      Professor Emeritus Derec Llwyd Morgan and Dr. Jason Walford Davies,\u000d\u000a      unanimously praised the series of `polished and exciting' poems.\u000d\u000a      Each poem responds to an artistic artifact, but develops its own\u000d\u000a      perspective and imaginative world. The adjudicators praised especially the\u000d\u000a      poet's `enterprising ingenuity and informed perceptiveness'.\u000d\u000a    In 2009, having already won the Prose Medal in 2006, Associate Professor\u000d\u000a      Fflur Dafydd won the prestigious Daniel Owen Memorial Prize at the\u000d\u000a      National Eisteddfod (held that year at Merioneth and District), for her\u000d\u000a      novel Y Llyfrgell (The Library) [R2]. In writing the novel,\u000d\u000a      Dafydd drew upon her own experiences as a researcher at the National\u000d\u000a      Library of Wales, though in terms of creative writing, research here must\u000d\u000a      be understood in terms of the work involved in creating plot and\u000d\u000a      character, finding the correct style and searching indeed for the correct\u000d\u000a      word, as the novelist transforms an original idea into a work of art. Y\u000d\u000a        Llyfrgell was lauded by one adjudicator of the competition,\u000d\u000a      Professor Emeritus John Rowlands, as `a highly unusual novel',\u000d\u000a      who noted that the theme of digitising national memories (archives and\u000d\u000a      literatures) was most relevant today but that the novel's success was due\u000d\u000a      to the author's vision being turned into such a compelling story.\u000d\u000a      Describing the author as `extremely inventive', he compared\u000d\u000a      Y Llyfrgell to a Greek tragedy.\u000d\u000a    The other two items by Fflur Dafydd which form part of this impact case\u000d\u000a      study are the lyrical concept albums, Byd Bach [R3] (Small\u000d\u000a      World, centred around places in Wales) and Ffydd Gobaith Cariad\u000d\u000a      [R4] (Faith Hope Love, a partly-commemorative album, featuring well known\u000d\u000a      Welsh figures as subjects). Byd Bach is a concept album and `a\u000d\u000a          valuable and impressive contribution to the genre ',\u000d\u000a      to quote Craig Owen Jones of Bangor University.

It\u000d\u000a      includes several commemorative songs (including `Ray o'r Mynydd', an elegy\u000d\u000a      to the broadcaster and former rugby star, Ray Gravell).

Their collaborative\u000d\u000a      research has opened up new business opportunities and models for\u000d\u000a      non-academic partners, and improved efficiency and consistency across a\u000d\u000a      number of translation platforms and contexts:\u000d\u000a    Corporations: ABBYY Corp and Google Inc:\u000d\u000a      Collaboration with ABBYY Corp was based on Sharoff's work on computational\u000d\u000a      lexicography [1,3,4] (on which he presented to an audience of 50\u000d\u000a      translation professionals in July 2011 [A]), and the CTS team's\u000d\u000a      work on MT technologies (5,6). A statement from ABBYY's Director of\u000d\u000a      Linguistics Research treats Sharoff's \"discovery of variation in\u000d\u000a      linguistic data ... coming from topics, genres or social stratification\" [3,\u000a        4] as contributing to their \"better understanding of the Web data\"\u000d\u000a      and helpful in their work in computational lexicography and MT [B].\u000d\u000a      Babych and Hartley's work on automated analysis of MT quality [5,6]\u000d\u000a      led to invitation from ABBYY for an expert assessment of their MT\u000d\u000a      technologies, which gave the corporation an \"awareness and confidence in\u000d\u000a      the prospects of these technologies and was used during the audit of...\u000d\u000a      ABBYYMT and Semantic Analysis projects audit by governmental and\u000d\u000a      commercial organisations\" [B].\u000d\u000a    The ASSIST research into automatic Web document classification [3],\u000a      particularly the development of ideas around \"Web page classification\"\u000d\u000a      prompted an expression of interest from Google Inc. in 2008 [C].\u000d\u000a      Sharoff subsequently received a Google Research Award [iii], and\u000d\u000a      was invited to present the CTS team's research to a group of 15 senior\u000d\u000a      staff members at Google headquarters in Zurich in December 2008. Google\u000d\u000a      has since integrated document classification functionality into its\u000d\u000a      searches, improving effectiveness and user experience.\u000d\u000a    Small business: Lingenio GmbH:\u000d\u000a      As part of the FP7 Marie Curie IAPP (Industry-Academia Partnership and\u000d\u000a      Pathways) project HyghTra [vii], CTS worked together with a German\u000d\u000a      translation company Lingenio GmbH to produce a technology for rapid\u000d\u000a      development of hybrid MT systems. Using statistical techniques to\u000d\u000a      automatically build linguistic resources, Babych's and Sharoff's\u000d\u000a      contribution allowed Lingenio to harvest and annotate large collections of\u000d\u000a      electronic texts, extract translation equivalents, create lists of related\u000d\u000a      terms across languages, and evaluate MT systems. Using this technology,\u000d\u000a      the company was able to re-design and streamline their system development\u000d\u000a      cycle and create MT products for a number of new languages, including\u000d\u000a      Dutch, Spanish, French, Russian and Ukrainian (a range previously\u000d\u000a      unattainable due to financial cost). In addition, a new development\u000d\u000a      framework for MT systems has enabled Lingenio to add languages and\u000d\u000a      translation directions within shorter time frames. Finally, the\u000d\u000a      developer-oriented environment created for the project has proved to be\u000d\u000a      effective as a tool for MT customisation, while the support of authoring\u000d\u000a      documents in a non-native language has enabled individuals to increase\u000d\u000a      their productivity [D]. A 5-day workshop involving 11 translators\u000d\u000a      was jointly organised by CTS and Lingenio in April 2013, in order to share\u000d\u000a      best practice and gather feedback from users.\u000d\u000a    International consortium: TAUS:\u000d\u000a      The technologies developed for the\u000d\u000a      ASSIST project have been shown to support translators in discovering\u000d\u000a      appropriate translation equivalents, to help developers of MT systems\u000d\u000a      encode rules for linguistic analysis and translation, and to improve the\u000d\u000a      accuracy of modern search engines by automatically classifying documents\u000d\u000a      on the internet. After reading Sharoff's work [1], the Director of\u000d\u000a      TAUS, an industrial consortium whose members include major translation\u000d\u000a      service providers and users, contacted CTS directly. This resulted in the\u000d\u000a      development of a free on-line Linguistic Search Engine for translators\u000d\u000a\u0009  (https:\/\/www.tausdata.org\/),\u000d\u000a      containing the world's largest collection of technical translations in\u000d\u000a      over 40 languages. This entailed the introduction by TAUS of a new\u000d\u000a      business model in which providers pool their collections in order to\u000d\u000a      maximise mutual benefit. As the Director of TAUS confirms, \"we had our own\u000d\u000a      ideas and vision about data sharing, but what CTS team contributed,\u000d\u000a      changed how we made that into services\" [E]. The TAUS Linguistic\u000d\u000a      Search Engine has since been integrated into the popular memoQ translation\u000d\u000a      memory system and currently receives some 470,000 searches each month [F].\u000a      As a result, translators now import a much larger collection of documents,\u000d\u000a      ensuring more consistent and terminologically appropriate translations.\u000d\u000a      Uptake of TAUS membership by large industrial and non-commercial partners\u000d\u000a      such as Adobe, Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Intel, DELL, Oracle, Philips,\u000d\u000a      European Patent Office, etc., is further testament to the viability of\u000d\u000a      this new business model and translation service.\u000d\u000a    Individual translators and governmental agencies:\u000d\u000a      After working with CTS, the Director of Lexical Computing (a provider of\u000d\u000a      computational solutions in lexicography for several major dictionary\u000d\u000a      publishers), remarked that the collaboration \"improv[ed] our understanding\u000d\u000a      of the nature of data coming from the Web,\" thereby enabling the\u000d\u000a      successful conversion of webpages into useful resources for translators [G].\u000a      Sharoff's research (specifically 2, 3 and 4) has\u000d\u000a      underpinned his co-edited A Frequency Dictionary of Russian\u000d\u000a      (Routledge, 2013), an invaluable tool for both learners and teachers,\u000d\u000a      providing a list of the 5,000 most frequently used words 300 multiword\u000d\u000a      constructions. Moreover, the CTS collection of resources from the Web in\u000d\u000a      15 languages is extensively used by researchers and translators on a\u000d\u000a      global scale.

The Head of the\u000d\u000a      Language and Technology Support Section of the Translation Centre for the\u000d\u000a      Bodies of the European Union commented that the research presented in the\u000d\u000a      workshops was \"very relevant for our activities and could lead to\u000d\u000a      improvements in terms of efficacy and efficiency\" [I]. Positive\u000d\u000a      feedback from participants [I] and continuing demand for new\u000d\u000a      sessions has led to the CTS workshops becoming a permanent fixture of the\u000d\u000a      IAMLADP programme.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Building on their groundbreaking research and collaborative networks,\u000d\u000a      Babych and Sharoff have developed a range of language technologies which\u000d\u000a      now reach major corporations, small specialist businesses, a large\u000d\u000a      industrial consortium, and agencies of the EU and UN.

This approach adopts ideas from distributional semantics,\u000d\u000a      paraphrasing using words that share similar contexts, and then recombining\u000d\u000a      their dictionary translations and paraphrases of translations. These\u000d\u000a      recombinations are then crosschecked against large monolingual collections\u000d\u000a      of conventional phrases in the target language. Instead of offering a\u000d\u000a      single translation solution, the technology delivers a ranked list of\u000d\u000a      alternatives, thus inspiring user creativity.\u000d\u000a    Sharoff's research on the collection of large language corpora [2]\u000d\u000a      led to the development of user-friendly tools for (a) harvesting large\u000d\u000a      text collections for a specific domain, such as aeronautical engineering\u000d\u000a      or wind energy, or a specific purpose, such as translation or language\u000d\u000a      teaching, and (b) enriching these collections with linguistic information,\u000d\u000a      such as syntactic properties. The project IntelliText [iv] further\u000d\u000a      developed the corpus access infrastructure \"CSAR\" that now hosts one of\u000d\u000a      the world's largest and richest collections of monolingual and bilingual\u000d\u000a      corpora in 15 languages. Sharoff's research on automated methods of\u000d\u000a      document analysis, similarity detection and classification within and\u000d\u000a      across languages [3, 4] was funded via a number of streams,\u000d\u000a      including ASSIST [i], WebDoc [iii], and TTC [v]. This\u000d\u000a      led to better understanding of the composition of the Web in term of\u000d\u000a      genres, as well as to improvements in using Web texts for language\u000d\u000a      teaching, translation and text analysis.\u000d\u000a    Babych's research on MT evaluation was supported by a Leverhulme Early\u000d\u000a      Career Fellowship [ii], followed by an invitation to join the\u000d\u000a      consortium that won another FP7 grant [vi]. This work opened the\u000d\u000a      door to automated error analysis for MT systems by combining corpus search\u000d\u000a      methods with established systems used to measure the quality of output,\u000d\u000a      such as BLEU [5, 6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6376","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This work has had an impact on the following groups:\u000d\u000a    Tourists and tourist organisations\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      In collaboration with UNESCO in Florence and the Comune di Firenze, we\u000d\u000a        have\u000d\u000a        developed itineraries, grounded in our research, to enable modern\u000d\u000a        tourists to experience\u000d\u000a        the religious and intellectual sites key to Dante's Florence.

It is the only centre of its kind in the UK.\u000d\u000a    The thread that runs through their research is an examination of the\u000d\u000a      political (Honess) and\u000d\u000a      theological (Treherne) concerns of Dante's writings in the context of &#8212;\u000d\u000a      rather than as something\u000d\u000a      to be extrapolated from &#8212; his poetry. Both, then, are concerned with the\u000d\u000a      social and religious\u000d\u000a      context of the poetry. Within the field of Dante studies, this focus on\u000d\u000a      the connection between\u000d\u000a      Dante's particular context and his poetic practice is distinctive, and has\u000d\u000a      led to new scholarly\u000d\u000a      understandings which in turn have direct relevance for key partners in\u000d\u000a      heritage, tourism and faith\u000d\u000a      groups.\u000d\u000a    Thus Treherne's research has demonstrated that Dante's theology needs to\u000d\u000a      be understood in\u000d\u000a      the context of lived religious experience &#8212; in particular, in the context\u000d\u000a      of the liturgical rituals\u000d\u000a      which helped shape medieval religious life (References 3, 4, 6).\u000d\u000a      Treherne shows that liturgical\u000d\u000a      experience is not merely decorative within Dante's text, but in fact\u000d\u000a      shapes experiences of time,\u000d\u000a      subjectivity and the sacred which are fundamental to Dante's poetic\u000d\u000a      experimentation (Reference\u000d\u000a      2). Uncovering the nature of religious experience can give access\u000d\u000a      to otherwise hidden\u000d\u000a      dimensions of the theology of Dante's poetry. Similarly, Honess's research\u000d\u000a      has shown how\u000d\u000a      Dante's views on politics ought not to be examined solely as abstract\u000d\u000a      ideas, divorced from the\u000d\u000a      everyday experience of life in late medieval Italy, but rather need to be\u000d\u000a      conceived as fully at one\u000d\u000a      with a thick social and cultural experience, connected to the discursive\u000d\u000a      structures of Dante's\u000d\u000a      poetic work and the manner in which political and social experiences were\u000d\u000a      played out in their\u000d\u000a      context (References 1, 3, 4, 5).\u000d\u000a    Throughout, a concern with the relationship between the historical\u000d\u000a      context of late medieval Italy,\u000d\u000a      and the poetic form through which Dante engages with that context, is\u000d\u000a      crucial. This focus marks\u000d\u000a      the current major AHRC-funded research project which Honess and Treherne,\u000d\u000a      in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with a colleague at the University of Warwick, are leading, \"Dante and\u000d\u000a      Late Medieval Florence:\u000d\u000a      Theology in Poetry, Practice and Society\". This project examines the ways\u000d\u000a      in which religious life\u000d\u000a      was experienced in the specific context of Florence in the 1280s and 1290s\u000d\u000a      &#8212; the period when\u000d\u000a      Dante was likely to have been studying theology in the city, ranging\u000d\u000a      across learned and popular\u000d\u000a      contexts. The originality of this research is in this close attention to\u000d\u000a      the local context, and to the\u000d\u000a      literary mediation of that context &#8212; research in Dante studies has tended\u000d\u000a      to treat intellectual and\u000d\u000a      cultural traditions as though they were divorced from the context in which\u000d\u000a      Dante and his\u000d\u000a      contemporaries would have known them &#8212; and therefore it fills a gap for\u000d\u000a      our partners who wish\u000d\u000a      to explore the lived experience of Christian life which shaped a central\u000d\u000a      work of European\u000d\u000a      literature and a key moment in European history.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6377","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    i.

K&amp;W is a major literary publisher of works by prominent\u000a      contemporary German and\u000a      international writers, such as Saul Bellow, V.S. Naipaul and Gabriel\u000a      Garcia Marquez with a\u000a      backlist of 568 authors. DTV exploits its paperback rights. The biggest\u000a      ever publishing project\u000a      in K&amp;W's history, the edition was designated as being of national\u000a      significance by the then\u000a      Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schr&#246;der at the launch ceremony in 2002. With\u000a      three volumes\u000a      released over a decade at the annual high-profile international Frankfurt\u000a      Book Fair, it\u000a      generated a fresh wave of prestige, publicity, marketing and sales\u000a      opportunities, not least\u000a      owing to the definitive re-editing of existing writings as well as the\u000a      presentation of unpublished\u000a      texts for the very first time which were quickly translated and sold under\u000a      new copyright around\u000a      the world.\u000a    `The way it was produced has been new in German publishing because we\u000a        have generated a\u000a        complete digital edition [...] and by this we are able to have a much\u000a        easier printing process\u000a        and we are also able to license other editions which can use our text\u000a        basis.

Digital Humanities\u000a    Impact was generated for the company Pagina Ltd via its close\u000a      collaboration on the project.\u000a      The software that was developed has `set the benchmarks for the\u000a      application of digital\u000a      humanities technologies to large-scale critical editions'. A particularly\u000a      important technical\u000a      innovation came in specific response to the team's editorial needs and has\u000a      been subsequently\u000a      disseminated as good practice in trade publications. The CEO acknowledges\u000a      the further\u000a      importance of the Edition to Pagina in establishing a new commercial\u000a      department for `Digital\u000a      Humanities' which has been central to his company's development as a\u000a      thriving enterprise,\u000a      helping it to win new business. It now occupies a niche as supplier to\u000a      other leading publishing\u000a      houses on projects such as the Complete Thomas Mann Edition for S Fischer\u000a      Verlag. Pagina\u000a      acknowledges the Edition as part of a causal development which underpinned\u000a      the company's\u000a      reputation as a market-leader, culminating in it being one of the\u000a      co-founders, in 2012, of the\u000a      joint professional organisation `Digital Humanities Deutschland'. [B]\u000a    iii. Culture, Heritage\/Tourism\u000a    The celebration of B&#246;ll as a `Cologne author' is tied directly into the\u000a      Edition and has generated\u000a      impact for municipal cultural and heritage institutions. Examples are the\u000a      `Literature in Cologne'\u000a      (LiK) and Heinrich B&#246;ll archives. Based in its Central Library with open\u000a      access to the general\u000a      public, LiK's mission is to raise and maintain the profile of the history\u000a      of Cologne literary life\u000a      since the Second World War so that it becomes part `of the public\u000a      consciousness'. In\u000a      corroborating interviews, the Director confirmed that the Edition was\u000a      `enormously important'\u000a      and that `its significance is incredibly high': it is an invaluable source\u000a      to deal with public\u000a      interest and enquiries and it obviates the need to make originals of texts\u000a      available which might\u000a      otherwise suffer damage. Moreover the wealth of new materials in the\u000a      apparatus has been\u000a      mined for regular public events and exhibitions associated with B&#246;ll's\u000a      life and work\u000a      (e.g.Output 1 on 30.11.2012). Exhibitions of other, broader\u000a      interest are given a B&#246;ll-theme\u000a      which deliberately capitalises on his high name-recognition to fulfil the\u000a      Director's vision of\u000a      making `a living archive' [C]. The entire second storey of the\u000a      Central Library has been restyled\u000a      as an interactive `Literary World' and its centrepiece is a recreation of\u000a      B&#246;ll's original\u000a      study\/library.\u000a    Impact has been generated for local tourism in Cologne. The Edition's\u000a      public sponsors as well\u000a      as public-service broadcaster WDR are partners in the `B&#246;ll and Cologne'\u000a      initiative. The city\u000a      has \"A Walking Tour of the City in the Footsteps of Heinrich B&#246;ll\" which\u000a      has been run for the\u000a      past five years and uses the writer's life and works as a window on the\u000a      city's history. Output 1\u000a      features on the website, particularly the section entitled \"Cologne in\u000a      B&#246;ll\", as it is the novel\u000a      which most evokes and references this history in the Twentieth Century [D].\u000a    The destruction of the building of the Historical Archives of the City of\u000a      Cologne in March 2009\u000a      and the loss of the original manuscripts and other documents means that\u000a      the finished volumes\u000a      now have a curatorial value to posterity immeasurably greater than\u000a      originally envisaged by the\u000a      editors. The Federal Minister for Culture and Media declared the Edition\u000a      `part of the national\u000a      literary heritage of Germany as a nation of culture'. [E]\u000a    iv. Media\/Public Sphere\u000a    The Edition has been extensively reported and discussed in the German and\u000a      international\u000a      media (substantial newspaper clippings are available), keeping the writer\u000a      in the book-buying\u000a      public's consciousness, and raising the profiles of the stakeholders and\u000a      sponsors. A touring\u000a      exhibition, a retrospective on B&#246;ll's life and works, supported by the\u000a      Goethe Institut and the\u000a      German Information Centre of the European Parliament, draws on many of the\u000a      new archival\u000a      discoveries (e.g. the colour plans for novels as described in Output 2,\u000a      since published\u000a      separately, and the wartime correspondence detailed in Output 5).\u000a      The Edition features\u000a      prominently in the activities, website and annual reports of the\u000a      independent political and\u000a      cultural Heinrich-B&#246;ll-Foundation, which has offices in thirty countries\u000a      around the world.

Of greatest significance is his work since 1999 as co-originator\u000a      and General Editor\u000a      of Die Werke Heinrich B&#246;ll's, in particular the volumes for which\u000a      Finlay was directly\u000a      responsible (Outputs 1 and 2), as well as his direct input to the\u000a      remaining 24 volumes which\u000a      appeared between 2002-2010 (e.g. 3 as well as research published\u000a      in outputs 4 and 5).\u000a      Taking eleven years to complete, this is the first ever scholarly edition\u000a      of B&#246;ll's complete\u000a      literary and non-literary output &#8212; fully annotated and entirely rethought.\u000a      It has brought to light\u000a      for the first time many important `new' works from his literary estate\u000a      housed in the Cologne's\u000a      Historical Archives, and in family and other collections. This involved\u000a      extensive analytical and\u000a      detective work and the discovery and editing of unknown and unpublished\u000a      literary manuscripts\u000a      and fragments of texts in genres not usually associated with the novelist.\u000a      The team also\u000a      identified and edited B&#246;ll's contributions in print and broadcast\u000a      journalism, public speeches\u000a      and texts for film and radio, as well copious interviews. The work on\u000a      individual texts included\u000a      comparing and documenting manuscripts, different drafts and significant\u000a      variants, along with\u000a      recording textual interventions\/emendations and tracing transmission and\u000a      publishing history.\u000a    A radical editorial principle allows an entirely new sense of the shape\u000a      of B&#246;ll's career: the\u000a      sequencing of texts in a strict chronology, irrespective of whether they\u000a      were published during\u000a      his lifetime and irrespective of text type. This necessitated\u000a      painstakingly precise dating and\u000a      some reconstruction of texts, particularly in the case of juvenilia and\u000a      unpublished work in the\u000a      war and early post-war years (e.g. Outputs 2, 4 and 5). In this\u000a      respect, the edition can point\u000a      up in new and revealing ways continuity of themes styles, literary\u000a      influences between and\u000a      across different texts, to chart and illuminate B&#246;ll's creative\u000a      development.

For example\u000a      extracts from private and business correspondence and notebooks provide\u000a      the new\u000a      biographical, socio-historical and literary-historical context, as does\u000a      the critical reception in the\u000a      case of the fiction, drama and poetry. The Edition has already helped\u000a      generate significant new\u000a      insights, modify earlier research findings, and is a rich store-house of\u000a      material for future\u000a      research.\u000a    The team's other major aim was to reflect the wider interests of public\u000a      and private sponsors\u000a      keen to develop new methodologies and ways of working of lasting benefit\u000a      to scholars\u000a      engaged on similarly large-scale, complex scholarly projects &#8212; and their\u000a      commercial\u000a      publishers. The demands of ambitious editorial principles, the\u000a      complexities of multiple\u000a      stakeholders, and scholars based in different countries working to rapid\u000a      publication deadlines\u000a      necessitated close collaboration between the team and its own digital\u000a      humanities support staff\u000a      based at the University of Siegen with software engineers at the\u000a      commercial company Pagina\u000a      Ltd. This involved a productive dialogue to develop new tools,\u000a      particularly to migrate and\u000a      transform digital content from a time-independent encoding and storage\u000a      format (i.e. it can be\u000a      used irrespective of future generation software and avoid problems of\u000a      compatibility with them)\u000a      for display, revision and ultimate printing and publishing- all parts of\u000a      an end-to-end, fully\u000a      electronic process.\u000a    This technical collaboration in regular special weekend workshops, which\u000a      also included\u000a      refining and consolidating editorial principles, was at its most intense\u000a      during the first five years\u000a      of the project which involved outputs 1 and 2 These volumes,\u000a      featuring, respectively over 60\u000a      short texts (over 50% first publications) and a long novel were amongst\u000a      those deliberately\u000a      chosen because of their diversity of text genre to act as the prototypes\u000a      for the entire edition,\u000a      appearing in its first two batches, respectively.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6378","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2589581","Name":"Algeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact for this project started in 2002, eliciting initial reach with\u000a      speaking engagements due to early publications. This created momentum\u000a      around the publication of Paris 1961 in 2006, and, crucially its\u000a      French translation in 2008. This culminated in 2011 with the 50th\u000a      anniversary of the massacre and in October 2012, when French President\u000a      Hollande formally recognized the existence of the massacre in the context\u000a      of the 50th anniversary of Algerian independence. Bolstered by\u000a      House's role as a central contact point for media correspondents,\u000a      filmmakers, civil society associations, as well as key individuals, the\u000a      research has had a significant impact on cultural life, education, policy,\u000a      public discourse and public services. It has been effective in four main\u000a      ways:\u000a    Firstly, its authoritative academic argument has increased public\u000a      understanding in the face of previous official French denials by providing\u000a      significant corroboration that a massacre took place. In legislation\u000a      seeking to formally recognize the massacre currently under consideration\u000a      by the French National Assembly, Paris 1961 is cited as proving\u000a      large-scale repression (A).This project has, according to the\u000a      co-president of the campaigning association Au nom de la m&#233;moire,\u000a      `strongly contributed' to achieving official (presidential) recognition of\u000a      the massacre in France (B). One public historian, campaigner and\u000a      former vice-president of the French Human Rights League (FHRL) commented\u000a      that in addition to changing perceptions within French society, the\u000a      project has helped associations linked to Algerian migration and human\u000a      rights groups to `formulate their demands for official recognition' (C).\u000a      See also b, c, d and e, below.\u000a    Secondly, and linked to the above, this project is recognized as having\u000a      generated `greater social visibility' of the massacre (F), thereby\u000a      helping move October 1961 from the margins to the centre of political\u000a      debates not only in France, but also in Algeria. In September 2012, House\u000a      was invited to the Algiers International Book Fair, where he discussed Paris\u000a        1961 with both Algerian President M. Bouteflika and Algerian Culture\u000a      Minister, Mme. Toumi (E). See also a and b, below.\u000a    Thirdly, this project has played a role in portraying the War of\u000a      Independence as a key moment transcending generation, nationality and\u000a      ethnicity. The former VP of the FHRL describes how the project has helped\u000a      public acceptance of the idea that the October 1961 violence constitutes\u000a      `a shared event' in Franco-Algerian history: this has strengthened\u000a      inter-ethnic solidarity and reinforced `harmonious co-existence (vivre-ensemble)'\u000a      (C). According to one key collaborator &#8212; a former humanitarian\u000a      worker (and subsequently author and campaigner) &#8212; this project has also\u000a      improved inter-generational solidarity by `providing an overarching\u000a      narrative that is accessible to younger generations', allowing them a\u000a      `better understanding of what their parents experienced' (F). See a\u000a      and c, below.\u000a    Finally, Paris 1961 has helped bring about what the former VP of\u000a      the FHRL has identified as `a new social and political climate' (C),\u000a      one which the former humanitarian worker believes is `more conducive' for\u000a      former demonstrators and their descendants, better enabling them to\u000a      publicly speak out about this difficult event (F). See also d\u000a      and e, below.\u000a    (a) Cit&#233; nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration (CNHI)\u000a      The State-run National Museum for Immigration History (Paris) has\u000a      regularly used House's expertise since 2008 because of his `authoritative'\u000a      work (D). Over the past decade, successive French governments have\u000a      given greater policy priority to the public recognition of the experience\u000a      of immigrants, which is seen to promote social cohesion. On 13\/10\/11,\u000a      House delivered a public lecture on the subject of October 1961 at the\u000a      CNHI, which was recorded as a podcast and has been downloaded 521 times\u000a      since November 2011. It has also been added to the France Inter radio\u000a      station webpage (G).\u000a    (b) Radio and print journalists (France, Algeria, United Arab Emirates\u000a        [UAE])\u000a      House has intervened in the public debates on the Franco-Algerian colonial\u000a      past by providing expert analysis and generating approximately twenty\u000a      interviews for national radio, newspapers, TV, documentaries and websites.\u000a      He was interviewed on national French state television (France 2) news on\u000a      17\/10\/11 (average audience 3 million), participated in an hour-long live\u000a      debate on La Fabrique de l'Histoire on France-Culture, France's\u000a      equivalent of Radio 4, (brodcast 15\/12\/10), and was included in an\u000a      hour-long documentary programme La Marche du monde on Radio France\u000a      Internationale, France's equivalent of the BBC World Service (broadcast\u000a      27\/10 \/12). House also appeared on live Algerian national radio (Radio\u000a      Alg&#233;rie internationale, 17\/10\/12), was interviewed by Le Monde\u000a      newspaper (Culture et id&#233;es supplement, 15\/10\/11 - average\u000a      circulation approx. 340,000) and the Algerian Arabic-language daily El-Khabar\u000a      (25\/12\/12). He was also cited in an article in the UAE newspaper The\u000a        National, published 19\/3\/12.\u000a    (c) Civil society associations (France, Algeria)\u000a      The project prioritized and directly supported initiatives with groups\u000a      containing a strong Algerian presence, helping older and younger\u000a      generations to understand October 1961. House gave presentations, produced\u000a      written content and acted as a research consultant for events organised by\u000a      civil society groups such as the Cercle des Alg&#233;riens et\u000a        Franco-Alg&#233;riens en Rh&#244;ne Alpes (Lyon), Au nom de la m&#233;moire,\u000a      Ancrages and Harkis et droits de l'homme, in addition to a\u000a      number of town councils and local associations, and the Amirat Foundation\u000a      in Algiers. His specialist support has `very usefully reinforced'\u000a      these initiatives (F).\u000a    (d) Documentary film-makers and writers\u000a      House has provided specialist advice to four documentary films, including\u000a      Ici on noie les Alg&#233;riens (2011), which was shown across France\u000a      (House spoke to an audience of 450 at the film's gala preview in Paris),\u000a      and in 2012 was nominated for a C&#233;sar and released on DVD. He also\u000a      supplied a contact for one of the film's main interviewees with whom he\u000a      had previously conducted interviews: this man's appearance in such a film\u000a      shows how some former participants now feel empowered to publicly speak\u000a      out (H). The research has also had an impact in the literary world:\u000a      inspired by Paris 1961, writer Albert Drandov wrote the text for a\u000a      graphic novel relating to the 17 October massacre (I).\u000a    (e) Individuals\u000a      A former humanitarian worker in the Algerian shanty-towns of suburban\u000a      Paris (Nanterre) many of whose inhabitants demonstrated on 17 October\u000a      1961. Since interviewing her in 2002, House has helped arrange for her\u000a      personal archives to be made available to the general public in a major\u000a      Paris research centre, IHTP (J). He has facilitated discussions\u000a      between this person (today an author and campaigner) and head archivists\u000a      and encouraged media attention to ensure the wider dissemination of her\u000a      experience and that of other former shanty-town residents (F).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research examined the causes, events and public memory of the violent\u000a      repression of a peaceful, pro-independence demonstration of 40,000\u000a      Algerians in Paris (17 October 1961). Initially covered up, these events\u000a      resurfaced to become one of the most controversial episodes in\u000a      Franco-Algerian history, formally recognized by the French state in 2012.\u000a      This project's key impacts have been on civil society and public discourse\u000a      in France and Algeria, changing and increasing both public understanding\u000a      and visibility of the massacre. Further important impacts were enhancing\u000a      inter-ethnic and inter-generational understanding and citizenship, by\u000a      providing social knowledge to campaigning groups, as well as enabling\u000a      former demonstrators to speak publicly.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Leeds\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Leeds (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Leeds","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007795}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2996944","Name":"Lyon"},{"GeoNamesId":"2988507","Name":"Paris"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a(1) Co-authored with Neil MacMaster: Paris 1961: Algerians,\u000a        State Terror, and Memory, Oxford University Press, 2006, 375pp.\u000a      Translated (2008) as Paris 1961.

The\u000a      research was undertaken between 2000 and 2005 and the book was published\u000a      in 2006 by OUP (1). This has been complemented by a number of\u000a      single and joint-authored publications (2-6). Paris 1961 is\u000a      the most comprehensive and original study in its field both because of the\u000a      wide range of sources used (archival, oral, print) and the methodological\u000a      approach adopted. Whereas previous analyses had concentrated on the\u000a      specific date of 17 October 1961, Paris 1961 argued that the\u000a      events of this day can be best understood within the longer history of a\u000a      repressive system in Paris inspired by methods of colonial policing and\u000a      counter-insurgency (state terror). Furthermore, Paris 1961\u000a      concentrated on a system, rather than on any one individual (e.g. Paris\u000a      Police chief Maurice Papon) and stressed that speaking of `October 1961'\u000a      better accounted for the weeks-long culmination of police anti-Algerian\u000a      violence and complex dynamics within the Algerian nationalist movement (6).\u000a      Simultaneously, Paris 1961 showed that mass killings of Algerians\u000a      had indeed taken place on and around 17 October 1961 itself.\u000a    No previous study had examined in as much detail why and how this\u000a      violence then `disappeared' in the years following the massacre, due to an\u000a      official cover up, tensions within the French Left, and the political\u000a      marginalisation of the French-based Algerian nationalists upon Algerian\u000a      independence. Nor had any study examined how and why the memory of October\u000a      1961 resurfaced in the 1980s, after several decades of virtual silence (2-4).\u000a      The key factor in this reappearance was the emergence in the 1980s of a\u000a      new generation of antiracist activists &#8212; often of Algerian heritage &#8212; who\u000a      promoted the public memory of this event within demands for symbolic\u000a      justice from the French state and sought to understand their parents'\u000a      historical trajectories (see also 3-4). October 1961 thus came to\u000a      occupy considerable public visibility, notably with Papon's trial (for\u000a      crimes against humanity during Vichy) in 1997-1998. Paris 1961\u000a      provided a uniquely detailed case study for the history of colonial \/\u000a      postcolonial memory in both France and Algeria, showing the event's\u000a      shifting and multi-layered meanings over a 45-year period. Its timely\u000a      publication in 2006 followed nearly a decade of considerable academic,\u000a      media and political interest in Franco-Algerian history.\u000a    The massacre's greatest visibility came at the 50th\u000a      anniversary (October 2011) in part due to the book's research findings, as\u000a      evidenced by the high number of references to Paris 1961 by\u000a      journalists, activists and public practitioners. The book went straight\u000a      into OUP paperback (2009), French translation (Tallandier, 2008), and then\u000a      a French edition in Algeria (Casbah, 2012).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6415","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Li's in-depth, specialist knowledge of Chinese theatre (modern and\u000d\u000a      traditional), her unique methodology of combining theatrical and\u000d\u000a      socio-cultural analysis in her research, and her background in theatre\u000d\u000a      practice, has allowed her to work with a range of international audiences,\u000d\u000a      theatre practitioners and arts professionals. Impact activities can be\u000d\u000a      divided into two strands: (1) the promotion of cross-cultural awareness to\u000d\u000a      general audiences through the Cao Yu centenary events; and (2) Li's\u000d\u000a      collaborations with theatre companies on an international scale, through\u000d\u000a      which she directly influenced programming and education policies.\u000d\u000a    Strand 1: Promoting cross-cultural awareness to general audiences\u000d\u000a        through the Cao Yu centenary project (2011-13)\u000d\u000a    In the UK, Canada, USA and China, large audiences were drawn to\u000d\u000a      exhibitions, public lectures, seminars, workshops, film screenings and a\u000d\u000a      stage production &#8212; The Sun Is Not for Us &#8212; a newly created work\u000d\u000a      based on four canonical plays by Cao Yu (1910-96), the pioneer of modern\u000d\u000a      Chinese drama. Generated from Li's research on the playwright and inspired\u000d\u000a      by Cao Yu's centenary in 2010, the project involved 17 venues (including\u000d\u000a      the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and the Shanghai International Contemporary\u000d\u000a      Theatre Festival) and attracted a combined audience of over approximately\u000d\u000a      25,000 across the UK, North America and China (A). Li closely\u000d\u000a      liaised with the company to develop the original script (regularly\u000d\u000a      advising on content and staging), and wrote content for the production\u000d\u000a      booklet and leaflet. She was solely responsible for curating the\u000d\u000a      exhibition, delivering workshops and lectures at select venues, and was\u000d\u000a      instrumental in securing funding to extend the geographic reach of the\u000d\u000a      tour (part of the Staging China network, the project raised\u000d\u000a      external funds totalling approx. &#163;25,000). Li's approach to planning and\u000d\u000a      delivering a Cao Yu themed workshop at the National Theatre of Scotland\u000d\u000a      led the producer to see the value of working with academics in the\u000d\u000a      development of cross-cultural productions (B).\u000d\u000a    Western audiences rarely get the opportunity to see Chinese works on this\u000d\u000a      scale, while Chinese audiences were enlightened by the stage production\u000d\u000a      because it demonstrated Western young people's understanding and\u000d\u000a      interpretation of Chinese classics. The Arts Manager of the British\u000d\u000a      Council (Shanghai) commented: `The Sun leaves us an inspiring\u000d\u000a      example of cultural exchange and hopefully a legacy in China' (C).\u000d\u000a      These activities have attracted large-scale media interest in the UK,\u000d\u000a      North America and China, including: 5 reviews of the 2012 Edinburgh Fringe\u000d\u000a      Festival; 3 Chinese language newspapers published in the UK\/Europe (with\u000d\u000a      circulation between 20,000-80,000, covering 12 European countries); 19\u000d\u000a      paper newspapers and magazines in China including Youth Daily (450,000);\u000d\u000a      Daily News (500,000), Shanghai Evening Post (750,000), China Financial and\u000d\u000a      Economic News (300,000) and Liaoning Daily (400,000); 52 online media\u000d\u000a      reports; 2 online video reports; 6 detailed reports on organizations'\u000d\u000a      websites including the Ministry of Culture; 3 TV reviews and a special\u000d\u000a      report programme (in English and Chinese); and over 100 audience members'\u000d\u000a      comments through Chinese mini blogs, including long reviews (D).\u000d\u000a    Strand 2: Changing theatre practice and informing cultural policy\u000d\u000a        nationally and internationally\u000d\u000a    In 2012-13 Li collaborated with the director, cast members, and publicity\u000d\u000a      and education departments of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) for its\u000d\u000a      first production of a Chinese play, The Orphan of Zhao. Her\u000d\u000a      specialist knowledge of Chinese theatre was highly valued by members of\u000d\u000a      the company and she was consulted on several occasions by the director on\u000d\u000a      matters of content and staging. Li led a 1-day method workshop with 20\u000d\u000a      company actors and contributed text for the production programme. As part\u000d\u000a      of the project outreach she also delivered a talk to 100 A-level students\u000d\u000a      at an international academy in Stratford-upon-Avon. In the words of the\u000d\u000a      RSC's Artistic Director, Li's workshop with the acting company was\u000d\u000a      `revelatory, and had a profound impact on the development of the\u000d\u000a      production' (E).\u000d\u000a    Li's expertise and research networks have also helped West Yorkshire\u000d\u000a      Playhouse (WYP) to extend its programming to include Chinese theatre. In\u000d\u000a      2005 she facilitated the joint production of The Dutiful Daughter\u000d\u000a      with London based Chinese Crackers (an organisation promoting links\u000d\u000a      between British and Chinese theatres) and the Sichuan People's Art Theatre\u000d\u000a      (SPAT). The original script was based on the experience of WYP\u000d\u000a      practitioners during a visit to Sichuan, where Li accompanied the group\u000d\u000a      and acted in the capacity of language and cultural interpreter, as well as\u000d\u000a      research consultant. Based on the success of this initial collaboration,\u000d\u000a      in 2010-11 SPAT received a grant from the Sichuan provincial government to\u000d\u000a      work with WYP a second time. Daniels (Co-I) has since made a trip to\u000d\u000a      Sichuan with the newly appointed Artistic Director of WYP, in preparation\u000d\u000a      for a second cross-cultural production (scheduled to be delivered in\u000d\u000a      2014). The Associate Director of Young People's Theatre at WYP has noted\u000d\u000a      that Li's research `added a rigour to the relationship that had influenced\u000d\u000a      the company's view of China, which is now spreading beyond professional\u000d\u000a      areas directly related to productions, outwards to other areas such as\u000d\u000a      Theatre in Education' (F).\u000d\u000a    Li was consulted by the organisers of the World Shakespeare Festival held\u000d\u000a      at the Globe Theatre in London as part of the Cultural Olympiad in 2011-12\u000d\u000a      (G) resulting in the inclusion of two Chinese theatre company\u000d\u000a      productions, Titus and Andronicus and Richard III, which\u000d\u000a      Li was asked to review for the official Festival blog (H). To\u000d\u000a      encourage future such collaborations and as part of the Staging China\u000d\u000a      project, Li convened the international symposium `Performing China' in\u000d\u000a      March 2013, bringing together theatre researchers and practitioners in an\u000d\u000a      open, interactive forum. After attending the event, the Executive Director\u000d\u000a      of the newly-established cultural exchange company Performance Infinite\u000d\u000a      wrote: `This symposium made me realize the importance of research.

By creating and reinterpreting cultural\u000d\u000a      capital, it has generated new ways of developing intercultural themes and\u000d\u000a      strategies within performance and its promotion, and has directly\u000d\u000a      influenced programming and education policy within the arts.

The aim of this\u000d\u000a      project is to examine how China is constructed and projected through\u000d\u000a      intra\/inter\/cross-cultural stage productions in Chinese (including\u000d\u000a      different dialects) and in English, and how theatre shapes perceptions of\u000d\u000a      China and Chinese culture through performances, including language\u000d\u000a      delivery, acting, directing, scenography and mise en sc&#232;ne.\u000d\u000a    While Chinese theatre is Li's primary object of study, the cross-cultural\u000d\u000a      orientation of her work facilitates a more inclusive understanding of the\u000d\u000a      arts in other contexts (1, 2, 3, 5), as is evident in the\u000d\u000a      collaborative, practice-led research projects for which Li was PI: Shakespeare\u000d\u000a        on the Chinese Stage 1979-89 (1999-2000); and Continuity,\u000d\u000a        Creativity and Regeneration: Li Yuru and Jingju's Creativeness in the\u000d\u000a        Second Half of the Twentieth Century (2010) (1, 2, 5, 6).\u000d\u000a      Her expertise in traditional and modern forms of Chinese drama, and her\u000d\u000a      background in theatre practice, has made her an invaluable consultant for\u000d\u000a      theatre directors, writers and practitioners on a national and\u000d\u000a      international scale. Her original research on the life and work of Cao Yu\u000d\u000a      (4) led to her instrumental role in the planning, organisation and\u000d\u000a      delivery of the Cao Yu inspired stage production, The Sun is Not for\u000d\u000a        Us, and related events, which toured the UK and China between 2011\u000d\u000a      and 2013. Moreover, her advocacy of cross-cultural exchange and reception\u000d\u000a      through drama and education has resulted in the facilitation of multiple\u000d\u000a      collaborations between HEIs, theatre groups and cultural organisations in\u000d\u000a      the UK, Canada and China since 2005, influencing working methods and\u000d\u000a      policy, and deepening a reciprocal awareness of Chinese and Western forms\u000d\u000a      of theatre.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7152","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Allwood's research has shaped debates, campaigns and decision-making\u000a      around women in politics and, in particular, the question of women's\u000a      presence in elected institutions.

It did this in three ways: firstly, by investigating women's\u000a      participation in mainstream and alternative forms of political activity;\u000a      secondly, by investigating the relation between gender and policy,\u000a      focusing on policy issues such as prostitution; and thirdly, by\u000a      investigating the political participation of marginalised women, focusing\u000a      on women refugees. The research was carried out between 1998 and 2008,\u000a      parts of it jointly with Dr. Khursheed Wadia, University of Warwick.\u000a    The book, Women and Politics in France (2000), covers women and\u000a      the state, political parties, trade unions; electoral behaviour and\u000a      attitudes; women's absence from politics; women in the ecology movement,\u000a      co-ordinations and feminist politics; increasing women's representation;\u000a      parity, democracy and citizenship. It brings together for the first time a\u000a      wide range of statistics and contains a series of original tables.\u000a    The research on prostitution forms part of the study of gender and policy\u000a      in France. It combines policy process tracing and impact assessment, both\u000a      of which are situated within a context of increasingly security-focused\u000a      political discourse in France. The research highlights the relation\u000a      between prostitution policy and anti-migration and anti-migrant measures,\u000a      demonstrating the particularly harsh impact of new measures on migrant\u000a      women.\u000a    By ensuring that external voices are able to shape research in process,\u000a      as well as guide it, Allwood's outputs have been crafted in order to\u000a      achieve the maximum impact for their intended audiences. The study of Refugee\u000a        Women In Britain And France (2010) began with an expectation that\u000a      the experience of political activism that these women brought with them\u000a      from their countries of origin was likely to motivate them to participate\u000a      in social and political life in their country of destination. Excluded\u000a      from formal party politics, they find ways to participate in civil society\u000a      organisations, in particular refugee and migrant associations and\u000a      humanitarian NGOs. The research involved interviews with refugee women\u000a      activists and participant observation in refugee women's groups at\u000a      institutions like the Maison des Femmes in Paris. The research was\u000a      presented at a public conference at the Sorbonne on 31 January 2006, which\u000a      brought together academics, practitioners, and service users. This has\u000a      ensured that the research has been conducted with input from external\u000a      partners and voices, guiding the research process to ensure that it is\u000a      best targeted towards achieving policy impact. Likewise, current research\u000a      on gender and policy in Europe has involved a series of interviews with EU\u000a      policy makers and Brussels-based NGOs.

This is\u000a      exemplary of the contribution\u000a      which O'Shaughnessy's research has made to public debate and discussion,\u000a      demonstrated by\u000a      the `footprint' of his research outputs in general and specialist media.\u000a    \u000a      He delivered a paper, to an audience of about forty, at a public\u000a        conference entitled\u000a        'France's mid-century crisis: 1930-1950' on 27\/11\/2010 at the Maison\u000a        Fran&#231;aise in\u000a        Oxford. A recording is available for public access online.\u000a      A paper given on Renoir at the University of Warwick in 2011 was\u000a        recorded and is\u000a        publicly available online as a podcast.\u000a    \u000a    This footprint can also be seen in O'Shaughnessy's influence on film\u000a      publications\u000a      internationally. Discussion of O'Shaughnessy's work in Positif, a\u000a      popular French film studies\u000a      journal with a circulation of 8,000, spoke of his Jean Renoir book as 'one\u000a      that people had\u000a      taken notice of' and his La Grande Illusion book as 'remarkable,\u000a      due to both its intellectual\u000a      rigour and the penetrating nature of its commentaries'. O'Shaughnessy's The\u000a        New Face of\u000a        Political Cinema was praised in Cineaste (a leading American\u000a      film studies journal aimed at a\u000a      non-academic audience with a circulation of 11,000) as \"a powerful and\u000a      eloquent polemic for\u000a      retaining a class analysis of film.\" Here, O'Shaughnessy's research can be\u000a      seen to be actively\u000a      shaping the nature of public discussions of film, driven by the reach and\u000a      significance of\u000a      outputs arising from original research.\u000a    By engaging at an impressive scale with non-specialist audiences,\u000a      O'Shaughnessy has\u000a      changed perceptions of film and media education, as shown by enthusiastic\u000a      testimonials,\u000a      whilst exercising a strong impact on public discourse, as shown by his\u000a      prominent 'footprint' in\u000a      various media.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Martin O'Shaughnessy is widely recognised as one of the leading\u000a      international scholars on the\u000a      work of Jean Renoir, one of France's greatest film directors.

The initial\u000a      thrust of his work (references 1 and 5 in section 3) was to take stock of\u000a      existing research on the\u000a      director and to update it in a series of important ways, looking, for\u000a      example, at the important but\u000a      neglected gender dynamics of his films, examining his mise-en-sc&#232;ne of the\u000a      national, challenging\u000a      reductionist accounts of the evolution of his political commitment, and\u000a      drawing out the important\u000a      critical dimension of his under-studied and underestimated later films.\u000a    More recently, he has built on this work in a range of ways. He has\u000a      developed an in-depth study\u000a      of Renoir's La Grande Illusion, combining high-level close\u000a      analysis with detailed attention both to\u000a      the film's intervention in a specific historical context and to its\u000a      subsequent reception history. As\u000a      part of his analysis of the film's genesis he discovered and discussed a\u000a      draft of the film that pre-\u000a      dated all known drafts (reference 2). He pursued his study of the film by\u000a      discussing the originality\u000a      of its use of sound compared with the other great war films of the 1930s\u000a      and its important\u000a      contribution to the memory of the 1914-18 war (reference 3).\u000a    By drawing attention to new sources, O'Shaughnessy's outputs effectively\u000a      shared insights\u000a      gathered during the process of research. This process has facilitated a\u000a      direct impact on public\u000a      discourse surrounding the film and ensured that the principles of public\u000a      engagement have\u000a      informed and shaped his work.\u000a    At the same time, building more broadly on his sustained attention to the\u000a      politics of style, he has\u000a      sought to correct the repeated critical over-insistance on the spatial\u000a      dimension of Renoir's 1930s\u000a      films. He has written about the mise-en-sc&#232;ne of 'deep time' in the\u000a      director's great works, thus\u000a      bringing out the vital links between their historical self-consciousness\u000a      and their style (reference\u000a      6). He has pursued this work on the politics of style by re-examining\u000a      Renoir's 1935 film, Le Crime\u000a        de Monsieur Lange, reasserting the radicalism of the its political\u000a      commitment and entering into\u000a      debate with those who seek to downplay it (reference 4).\u000a    In focussing on French political cinema, O'Shaughnessy offerred new\u000a      insights into existing\u000a      works whilst stressing the rich cultural value of the cinematic text. This\u000a      process of communication\u000a      has extended to public discussions which have in turn fed back into his\u000a      research and discussion\u000a      of more modern works. By ensuring that public engagement has been strongly\u000a      allied to his\u000a      approach, O'Shaughnessy has augmented his own studies, ensuring they are\u000a      better able to find\u000a      traction within public discourse.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7320","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Carter was committed from the outset to the widest possible dissemination\u000a      of her research on Bal&#225;zs. Her fundraising efforts to this end with\u000a      various bodies including Screen and the Kraszna- Krausz foundation\u000a      culminated in a symposium for academic and public audiences, which was co-\u000a      funded and co-organised with Screen, with further support in kind\u000a      and financially from the University of Warwick and the University of\u000a      London\/School of Advanced Study Institute for Germanic and Romance\u000a      Studies. The symposium inspired an exhibition and related public outputs\u000a      that refigured Bal&#225;zs's writings in the more widely accessible media of\u000a      photographic collage, public talks, a project website, and screenings of\u000a      classical popular film. The impact is thus two-fold: on the artist who was\u000a      inspired by Carter's research to collaborate on the exhibition; and on the\u000a      audiences who viewed the exhibition, attended a related book launch and\u000a      film screenings, visited the websites associated with the project, and\u000a      read online and magazine reviews (see `References' above) that situated\u000a      the volume in relation to developments in contemporary film.\u000a    The impact began in May 2009, when Carter co-organised with Annette Kuhn\u000a      (QMUL\/Screen), and delivered a paper at, a symposium on Bal&#225;zs at\u000a      the Institute for Germanic and Romance Studies (IGRS), London. The\u000a      symposium was one of a series of events celebrating Screen's 50th\u000a      anniversary; Screen had co-funded the Bal&#225;zs translation, and\u000a      joined with the IGRS, Warwick and Berghahn books in staging an event that\u000a      drew participants from outside academia including European film\u000a      practitioners, and the artist and curator Zsuzsanna Ard&#243;. Ard&#243; had long\u000a      been interested in Bal&#225;zs's work, and Carter's paper as well as the\u000a      publication of the Screen extract from Livingstone's translation\u000a      prompted an approach to Carter to work together on an exhibition and\u000a      related public events. Carter applied to, and won from the Warwick\u000a      Institute of Advanced Study an Impact Award of &#163;2500 to support the\u000a      project; modest further funding was supplied by the Department of German\u000a      and Berghahn books. With Carter as academic advisor, Ard&#243; developed a\u000a      collage-based exhibition which placed Bal&#225;zs's texts in juxtaposition and\u000a      dialogue with stills and photographs from the films he discusses in Visible\u000a        Man and The Spirit of Film. Mounted initially in the\u000a      members' lounge at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts\u000a      (BAFTA), 195 Piccadilly, The Spirit of Film: the Road to Casablanca\u000a        via B&#233;la Bal&#225;zs grew out of meetings from September 2009 on, when\u000a      Carter worked collaboratively with Ard&#243;, discussing the selection of texts\u000a      and images, liaising with BAFTA staff to organise a book and exhibition\u000a      launch and screening, and producing copy for the publicity material and\u000a      website. BAFTA was fully involved as a project partner: BAFTA's graphic\u000a      designer assisted with the artwork under the direction of Ard&#243;, and the\u000a      communications manager included the launch in the BAFTA official\u000a      programme, advertised in the BAFTA newsletter to over 6,500 members.\u000a      Further partners were Berghahn, who contributed funds for a wine\u000a      reception; and the BFI and the Luk&#225;cs Arch&#237;vum, Budapest, both of whom\u000a      provided images and related material, the latter on the basis of previous\u000a      contact with Carter relating to picture research for her introduction to\u000a      the Berghahn volume.\u000a    The BAFTA exhibition opened on 8 June 2010 in the BAFTA members' lounge\u000a      with a private view and book launch for over 100 invited guests, funders,\u000a      and BAFTA members. The launch culminated in a screening in the BAFTA\u000a      cinema of Michael Curtiz's Casablanca (1942), a film that Carter\u000a      presented in a brief introductory talk on the wider history of Central\u000a      European exile to which the film alludes and that also marked the personal\u000a      life stories of both Curtiz and Bal&#225;zs. Amongst the distinguished guests\u000a      at the screening and launch were representatives from the Kraszna- Krausz\u000a      Foundation, the Oxford Hungarian Society, and the BAFTA founding member,\u000a      BAFTA Fellow and first British Film Commissioner, Sir Sydney Samuelson.\u000a      Carter has maintained contact with Sir Sydney since that event; an\u000a      interview with him on his early activities as a cameraman for the Colonial\u000a      Film Unit will feature in her forthcoming research and publications on\u000a      German-Jewish exile in the British Empire after 1933; she co-organised a\u000a      panel with him at a London Screen Studies postgraduate research training\u000a      conference in November 2012, and further impact activities are envisaged\u000a      including film talks and screenings around her future research.\u000a    The Spirit of Film: the Road to Casablanca remained on display at\u000a      BAFTA from June to October 2010, where it was open to members only. A\u000a      parallel exhibition then toured to Everyman Cinema locations in London. It\u000a      was on display in the lobbies of Everyman Hampstead from June to August\u000a      2010, Everyman Belsize Park in September, and Everyman Baker St. in\u000a      October and November 2010, reaching audiences via this route for one of\u000a      the oldest and most established independent cinema chains in the capital.\u000a      The exhibition continued to feature on the BAFTA website throughout 2010;\u000a      it has gained longevity via the Warwick Bal&#225;zs website, which features a\u000a      slide show from the exhibition, photographs from the book launch, and\u000a      supporting text on the project and on Carter's work on Bal&#225;zs. The\u000a      exhibition's continuing online presence is further assured by its\u000a      profiling on Ard&#243;'s own website. Her page on the exhibition features\u000a      visitor statements and comments from BAFTA collaborators noting how her\u000a      show captures `incredibly well the ideas that Bal&#225;zs was trying to\u000a      communicate,' and observing further that `[t]he exhibition looks fabulous\u000a      in situ both for its immediate visual impact and for piquing\u000a      people's interest so that they take a closer look to get each image's\u000a      meaning....A pioneering project in many ways.

Bal&#225;zs had long been familiar to Anglophone readers from Edith\u000a      Bone's 1952 translation of his Theory of the Film. But his\u000a      German-language writings on early cinema, though influential in the\u000a      German- speaking countries, were largely unknown. By the turn of the\u000a      twenty-first century, there were compelling reasons to plug this scholarly\u000a      gap. The advent of new digital media, and the dispersal of the film\u000a      experience across multiple sites and viewing platforms, has led in recent\u000a      years to an increased film studies interest in writings from the early\u000a      years of the film medium. The early twentieth-century emergence of film as\u000a      a new art form led contemporary commentators from Hugo M&#252;nsterberg and\u000a      Jean Epstein, to Walter Benjamin, and Bal&#225;zs himself, to explore in their\u000a      writings the effect of the new medium on popular aesthetics, subjectivity\u000a      and cultural experience. As Bal&#225;zs wrote in his 1930 The Spirit of\u000a        Film, `[t]he substrate [of this new medium] is the subject, the\u000a      human subject, man in his social being' (Carter &amp; Livingstone 2010:\u000a      96).\u000a    A similar interest in the human consequences of media-aesthetic\u000a      developments animates the renewed focus on the `film experience' in\u000a      twenty-first century film studies (Casetti, 2008), and has also generated\u000a      a new archaeology of film theory focusing on early writings in Britain\u000a      (Marcus 2008), the US (Higgins 2011), France (Abel 1993), Germany (Hake\u000a      1993) and elsewhere. A chapter on Bal&#225;zs in Hake's The Cinema's Third\u000a        Machine tantalized non German-speaking readers in 1993 with\u000a      extensive references to two then untranslated early Bal&#225;zs volumes, Visible\u000a        Man (1924), and The Spirit of Film (1930). The time seemed\u000a      ripe for a revisiting of these two early works; Carter thus embarked in\u000a      2005 on a collaboration on Bal&#225;zs with translator Rodney Livingstone\u000a      (Emeritus, Southampton). Grant funding was raised from the Kraszna-Krausz\u000a      Foundation, the AHRC, Warwick University, and the film journal Screen,\u000a      and the outcome was the first full English-language translation of Visible\u000a        Man and The Spirit of Film.\u000a    Carter's extensive introduction to the translation embeds Bal&#225;zs's film\u000a      writing in its intellectual and cultural-historical context, and explores\u000a      the key theoretical tenets elaborated in the two early texts. While Visible\u000a        Man, she suggests, celebrates the film medium's intimate\u000a      representation of the human body and face, The Spirit of Film\u000a      offers a first attempt at a coherent poetics, as well as a formal\u000a      `grammar' of the medium of film. Focussing in particular on Bal&#225;zs's\u000a      phenomenological understanding of the filmic body, the close up and\u000a      montage, Carter further shows how his work resists the formalism of some\u000a      contemporary phenomenological film theory through its historical embedding\u000a      in the film writings and practice of the Central European avant-garde, as\u000a      well as in the revolutionary activities in which Bal&#225;zs was engaged\u000a      throughout his early career.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7321","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Key prints from the Tableaux collection at Waddesdon Manor were\u000d\u000a      used to create teaching resources and educational activities, introducing\u000d\u000a      primary and secondary school pupils to the Revolution and to source\u000d\u000a      analysis.

Impact on the Heritage Industry\u000d\u000a    `Waddesdon Manor's mission is to enhance understanding and enjoyment\u000d\u000a        of the collections, and research is the foundation on which this should\u000d\u000a        be built.' (Curator). Warwick's projects (digital catalogue,\u000d\u000a      exhibition, and educational resources) based on research into the Tableaux\u000d\u000a      have helped Waddesdon work towards this. Waddesdon's institutional\u000d\u000a      strategy involves creating a general online catalogue (for completion\u000d\u000a      2015\/6), and the Tableaux project has contributed significantly to\u000d\u000a      this objective. 400 prints were catalogued, digitised and contextualised\u000d\u000a      by doctoral students Claire Tr&#233;vien (Warwick) and Paul Davidson (QMUL),\u000d\u000a      supervised by Astbury, Colin Jones (Professor of History, QMUL) and Juliet\u000d\u000a      Carey (Curator of Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture, Waddesdon). The\u000d\u000a      academic supervisors had overall responsibility for the research, ensuring\u000d\u000a      the accuracy of historical interpretation and understanding. They verified\u000d\u000a      the translations, worked closely on the in-depth commentaries for 54\u000d\u000a      feature prints, and helped to prepare the introductory material for the\u000d\u000a      digital catalogue. Astbury's expertise on the symbolic projection of\u000d\u000a      political attitudes towards or against the Revolution fed directly into\u000d\u000a      the interpretation of the prints. For instance, Astbury's research into\u000d\u000a      the use of the natural world as a response to the Revolution was important\u000d\u000a      since 300 of the 400 prints contain recurrent motifs recalling the\u000d\u000a      rootedness of the natural world. Astbury identified in her 2011 article\u000d\u000a      that trees were often used to represent the stability of the old order and\u000d\u000a      the constancy of the natural world in the face of revolutionary upheaval.\u000d\u000a    The digitised prints, which went online in 2011, have allowed Waddesdon\u000d\u000a      to display part of the collection not normally accessible to the public.\u000d\u000a      It has strengthened Waddeson's links with outside institutions and raised\u000d\u000a      awareness of the collections among the academic and curatorial\u000d\u000a      communities, and with the broader public. Having the prints digitised has\u000d\u000a      allowed them to be featured in other forums, such as the BBC History Extra\u000d\u000a      Website in February 2013 (1197 page views to July 2013). Waddesdon has\u000d\u000a      also benefited from increased exposure to school pupils who have been\u000d\u000a      introduced to the prints through the resource packs developed by Astbury.\u000d\u000a    The research was also presented as an exhibition, `A Subversive Art:\u000d\u000a      Prints of the French Revolution' at Waddesdon, seen by an estimated 45,000\u000d\u000a      visitors April-November 2011, co-curated by Tr&#233;vien, Davidson and\u000d\u000a      Phillippa Plock (Waddesdon). The Tableaux volumes were displayed\u000d\u000a      alongside the digital catalogue and 20 poster-size reproductions of prints\u000d\u000a      (with explanatory text), selected to give visitors a sense of the various\u000d\u000a      print techniques used and the political messages conveyed in the prints.\u000d\u000a      Contrasting images were displayed side by side which allowed visitors to\u000d\u000a      appreciate the complexities of Rothschild's collecting tastes, not usually\u000d\u000a      a feature of the visitor experience. The exhibition was accompanied by a\u000d\u000a      special interest day (Oct 2012; 16 participants) and a trail throughout\u000d\u000a      the house which drew attention to objects and individuals associated with\u000d\u000a      the French Revolution. The trail was singled out for praise in the Enjoy\u000d\u000a      England Visitor Attraction Quality Assurance scheme annual visitors'\u000d\u000a      report (2011) as being a `stimulus for visitors to more fully appreciate\u000d\u000a      the extensive contents [of the house].'\u000d\u000a    2. Impact on Education\u000d\u000a    The research has been used to develop educational initiatives to enhance\u000d\u000a      teaching and learning of the national curriculum in Modern Foreign\u000d\u000a      Languages (MFL), History, Literature and Citizenship at primary and\u000d\u000a      secondary level. 300 secondary schools and FE colleges in the UK received\u000d\u000a      the resource pack for History A-Level and IB students developed from the\u000d\u000a      prints by Astbury (with educational expertise from A-level history teacher\u000d\u000a      Andy Holland). Astbury's research was used to establish the historical\u000d\u000a      framework, identify the prints' key themes and highlight the importance of\u000d\u000a      symbolism, the possibility of implicitly communicated messages, and the\u000d\u000a      illustrators' motives to understand better the meaning of the prints. The\u000d\u000a      pack and supplementary online resources are available to download via the\u000d\u000a      Historical Association website and Warwick's French department website.\u000d\u000a      Since the resource packs were made available in September 2012, there have\u000d\u000a      been a combined 3,753 hits and 343 downloads. Teachers who have used the\u000d\u000a      packs have said that it has helped support the acquisition of historical\u000d\u000a      knowledge: `I used the images to develop their skills in analysing primary\u000d\u000a      evidence as well as deepening their synoptic understanding. The texts were\u000d\u000a      very clear and provided valuable contextual information.' (A2 Level AQA\u000d\u000a      Module `France and the Enlightenment', John Cleveland College, Hinckley,\u000d\u000a      Leics.) According to the Access to HE History course leader at North\u000d\u000a      Warwickshire College, `No one in the group had formally studied the French\u000d\u000a      Revolution prior to coming onto the course. However, with the Waddesdon\u000d\u000a      material as a focal point, they were able to assimilate new ideas and\u000d\u000a      concepts quickly and efficiently. They seem to have enjoyed the Unit to\u000d\u000a      the extent that their enthusiasm drove them to independently organise a\u000d\u000a      visit to Waddesdon during the Easter break.'

Over 200 students from around the country, ranging from Year 6 to\u000d\u000a      Sixth Form, were introduced to the prints to learn about the French\u000d\u000a      Revolution; how to analyse visual material for research; and how the\u000d\u000a      themes in the prints, such as trauma, are relevant for their courses.\u000d\u000a      Highlights include a workshop at Oxford High School (4.10.2012) for 20\u000d\u000a      GCSE and A-Level French students. 50 Year 9 pupils attended a day about\u000d\u000a      Revolutionary propaganda (26.3.2013) where 75% felt that learning how to\u000d\u000a      analyse prints greatly helped with understanding the French Revolution and\u000d\u000a      could be applied to historical study in other areas. Nearly all of the\u000d\u000a      pupils (97%) understood that culture played an important role in politics\u000d\u000a      as a result of the session. The material has also proved useful for\u000d\u000a      students in Languages, English Literature and History: 22 Sixth-form\u000d\u000a      students in these subjects learned about literary and visual\u000d\u000a      representations of gender, violence and power in the eighteenth century\u000d\u000a      (21.3.2013) by comparing the depiction of Marie-Antoinette in the prints\u000d\u000a      with modern film portrayal.\u000d\u000a    The material has also been adapted successfully for primary school\u000d\u000a      pupils: in Spring 2013, 42 Year 6 pupils in KS2 Citizenship undertook a\u000d\u000a      research project on the Revolutionary prints, following a workshop on\u000d\u000a      campus.

Within this theme, Dr Katherine\u000d\u000a      Astbury (appointed 1999) researches responses to and representations of\u000d\u000a      French Revolutionary events in contemporary texts and images. Her most\u000d\u000a      recent monograph (2012) examines how print media were used to reflect both\u000d\u000a      individual and collective responses to the trauma of the French\u000d\u000a      Revolution. Her research challenges previous conclusions that narrative\u000d\u000a      production in the 1790s was largely a-political, and demonstrates how the\u000d\u000a      bestselling novels of the decade are instead reflections on the emotional\u000d\u000a      and psychological effects of the Revolution and of the Terror in\u000d\u000a      particular.\u000d\u000a    Denial is the first stage in the grieving process experienced by trauma\u000d\u000a      survivors. Therefore, novels or images which are not overtly political are\u000d\u000a      not examples of escapism or a desire to avoid the trauma, but rather\u000d\u000a      represent the author's or artist's attempt to come to terms with the\u000d\u000a      traumatic experience. Only after retreat into a safe location is it\u000d\u000a      possible for the trauma sufferer to restore the social bonds and affective\u000d\u000a      ties shattered by the traumatic event and begin to relive the experience\u000d\u000a      by confronting it. Eventually, it becomes possible for survivors to bear\u000d\u000a      witness and tell of the trauma, come to terms with the experience, and\u000d\u000a      reconnect with ordinary life and society. Trauma victims often want to\u000d\u000a      both deny and declare their experiences. Reading these texts therefore\u000d\u000a      means attending to implicit as well as explicit meanings in order to\u000d\u000a      uncover what is being avoided as well as what is being articulated.\u000d\u000a      Analysing symbols and gestures portrayed in novels and images produced\u000d\u000a      during the 1790s is a means for accessing individual reactions to the\u000d\u000a      collective trauma. For example, the &#233;migr&#233; novel, a sub-genre of the\u000d\u000a      sentimental novel which Astbury explored in her 2011 article, used the\u000d\u000a      wounded &#233;migr&#233; rescued by peasants as a common motif. It was depicted\u000d\u000a      frequently in illustrations and frontispieces, as the representation of\u000d\u000a      retreat into a place where the social bonds and trust broken by the\u000d\u000a      Revolution could be restored.\u000d\u000a    Dr Astbury's expertise in printed narrative and visual responses to\u000d\u000a      trauma in the French Revolution led to an AHRC Collaborative Doctoral\u000d\u000a      Award (CDA), in parallel with Queen Mary, University of London, to explore\u000d\u000a      images of the French Revolution in the Tableaux de la R&#233;volution\u000d\u000a        fran&#231;aise, a unique collection of prints at Waddesdon Manor.\u000d\u000a      Acquired by Baron Ferdinand Rothschild in the 1890s, the Tableaux\u000d\u000a      comprise 4 bound volumes of nearly 500 images - from crude etchings to\u000d\u000a      sophisticated propaganda - which record and satirise the major events of\u000d\u000a      the French Revolution from a range of political standpoints. The bulk of\u000d\u000a      the prints were produced during the 1790s following the relaxation of\u000d\u000a      censorship laws in 1788-89. The dramatic upsurge in the number of prints\u000d\u000a      on the market demonstrates the importance of narrative and imagery to the\u000d\u000a      illustrators and the consumers of these works. The successfully completed\u000d\u000a      PhD at Warwick (Claire Tr&#233;vien, 2008- 2012) examined the presentation of\u000d\u000a      spectacle in the prints 1789-94. Spectacle and theatricality reflected the\u000d\u000a      traumatic experiences of the Revolution as readers craved increasingly\u000d\u000a      sensational materials in response to the increasingly extraordinary\u000d\u000a      political and social reality. The CDA produced an online catalogue and\u000d\u000a      database of the Tableaux prints which is available on the\u000d\u000a      Waddesdon Manor website.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7639","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Allan's research into the legacy of the German Enlightenment challenges\u000a      preconceived ideas\u000a      about justice, crime and punishment, and prompts critical reflection on\u000a      the role of education, art\u000a      and the physical environment in shaping the relationship between the\u000a      individual and society.

The research has enriched the\u000a      cultural experiences of\u000a      creative organisations and their audiences, and the general public.\u000a    1a. Impact on Education (schools)\u000a    This research has been used to enhance learning in A-Level Law, History,\u000a      Languages and\u000a      Literature through two school symposia in November 2012 and March 2013.\u000a      The first involved 50\u000a      students from 26 secondary schools and Sixth Form Colleges across the West\u000a      Midlands. A film\u000a      version of Kleist's 1811 novella Michael Kohlhaas (The Jack\u000a        Bull, 1999) was shown to give\u000a      students a platform for debating competing notions of fairness, justice\u000a      and democracy with\u000a      reference to the tension between universal ideals and changing historical\u000a      settings. Students were\u000a      introduced to new perspectives on key study topics and to new ways of\u000a      learning including a\u000a      university-style lecture, using film as a case study, and peer-to-peer\u000a      learning through group\u000a      discussion. Students learned about legal issues in historical context, and\u000a      about the social and\u000a      political influences that can affect judicial decision-making. Evaluation\u000a      of the event showed that\u000a      91% of participants gained new perspectives on legal issues while for\u000a      nearly half the group (46%)\u000a      engaging with the story of Michael Kohlhaas changed their own\u000a      ideas about crime and\u000a      punishment. The event offered students an opportunity to gain a more\u000a      in-depth appreciation for\u000a      their subjects, to gain a broader range of evidence for understanding\u000a      contemporary social, political\u000a      and legal topics, and to develop critical thinking skills.\u000a    A follow-up event was advertised to schools nationwide and attracted\u000a      students from Coventry,\u000a      Birmingham, Liverpool and Greater London. Held in March 2013 it formed\u000a      part of a 3-day event on\u000a      European literature and culture in the `Age of Austen' which offered new\u000a      interpretations and\u000a      understanding of Austen's Pride &amp; Prejudice, one of the most important\u000a      novels in English literary\u000a      history, on the 200th anniversary of its publication. Allan\u000a      presented on eighteenth-century\u000a      understandings of education, violence and morality which were explored\u000a      further in the group\u000a      discussions. Discussion was stimulated by screening the 1976 film\u000a      adaptation of The Marquise von\u000a        O based on Kleist's novella of the same title published in 1808. The\u000a      film and discussions allowed\u000a      students to explore some of the key issues that troubled thinkers of the\u000a      European Enlightenment,\u000a      such as what are the causes of violence and how violent crimes should be\u000a      dealt with, as well as\u000a      exploring issues of class and gender. Evaluation of student learning\u000a      objectives have showed that\u000a      students learned about women in the age of Enlightenment and gained a\u000a      better understanding of\u000a      the social, cultural and political currents in the `Age of Austen'. Some\u000a      students also commented\u000a      that the content was helpful for exams in `both English and History, and\u000a      [for making] connections\u000a      between 18th century Germany, France and Britain.'\u000a    1b. Impact on education (adult learners)\u000a    Allan's research into the reception of the art and literature of the\u000a      Enlightenment during the\u000a      nineteenth century raises issues about the way in which aesthetics can be\u000a      used to promote the\u000a      concept of a rationally ordered society. Allan's public lecture on the art\u000a      and architecture of\u000a      nineteenth-century Berlin for the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (4 December\u000a      2012) enabled some 55\u000a      adult learners between the ages of 28 and 65 to develop an understanding\u000a      of the ideological\u000a      underpinning of the Enlightenment and enhanced their understanding of the\u000a      cultural and\u000a      architectural transformation of Berlin during the nineteenth century.\u000a    2. Impact on Cultural Life\u000a    The research has been used to create and interpret cultural capital in\u000a      literature, theatre and film.\u000a      Together with team members from the AHRC project `Kleist, Education and\u000a      Violence', Allan\u000a      recorded a series of 6 podcasts about Kleist's life, the intellectual\u000a      environment of the European\u000a      Enlightenment and a selection of his writings (Michael Kohlhaas, The\u000a        Marquise von O, The\u000a        Earthquake in Chili, The Betrothal in St. Domingo) for the\u000a      general listener. Available for download\u000a      via the project website since July 2012, the podcasts have been accessed\u000a      12,383 times. 41% of\u000a      users were new to the site, while 46% of all users were from outside the\u000a      UK (until 31 July 2013).\u000a    The reach of Allan's research was extended by his appearance on the\u000a      current affairs show Reality\u000a        Check on Austria Radio's FM4 station. The programme on the Grimm\u000a      Brothers' Children's and\u000a        Household Tales (1812) was broadcast on 12 December 2012 for which\u000a      Allan discussed\u000a      representations of violence in their work in the context of the German\u000a      Romantics' response to the\u000a      universalising tendencies of the Enlightenment. The station is a\u000a      subsidiary of Austrian national\u000a      radio (ORF) and the station's website, which simulcasts and stores all\u000a      programmes, is visited by\u000a      30,000 unique users every day.\u000a    Allan's research has also had an impact upon the performing arts. He was\u000a      commissioned to write\u000a      an introductory essay on J&#252;rgen B&#246;ttcher's creative engagement with the\u000a      Renaissance artists\u000a      Paulus Potter, Giorgione, and Emanuel de Witte in Verwandlungen\u000a      (1981) as a special bonus\u000a      feature for the commercial DVD release of J&#252;rgen B&#246;ttcher &#8212; Artworks\u000a      (2011). The DEFA film\u000a      library\/ICESSTORM Inc. who produce these DVDs has said `J&#252;rgen B&#246;ttcher: A\u000a      Brief Visit'\u000a      represents the first detailed examination of B&#246;ttcher's short films on\u000a      East German art and artists\u000a      ever published. In addition to offering basic information not available to\u000a      average viewers, it\u000a      encourages new research into East German art and helps instructors use\u000a      these films in their\u000a      teaching.' The DVD was publicly screened at the Goethe-Institut in\u000a      New York, Darkside Cinema in\u000a      Oregon, and at the DEFA Film Library, Amherst, Mass., where it was\u000a      introduced by Allan. Sales for\u000a      the DVD to the end of July 2013 are 128 and have been sold to the British\u000a      Film Institute, London,\u000a      the Lindenau Museum, Altenburg, Germany, the International Goethe-Institut\u000a      Network, and to\u000a      universities, wholesalers and private users.\u000a    Allan's research on the reception of the Enlightenment in the twentieth\u000a      century has also\u000a      enhanced the ways in which professional artists engage with our shared\u000a      cultural heritage. This\u000a      research fed into the RSC's recent production of A Life of Galileo\u000a      (Swan Theatre, Stratford, 31 Jan\u000a      &#8212; 30 Mar 2013; 33 performances, 13,686 tickets sold). Allan's two-hour\u000a      workshop with the director\u000a      and 30-member cast (10 December 2012) sharpened their understanding of the\u000a      historical\u000a      significance of Enlightenment thought for Brecht's theatre, especially in\u000a      regard to the Brechtian\u000a      analysis of institutionalised power and class-based violence towards the\u000a      oppressed. Allan also\u000a      contributed an essay for the programme about the social and political\u000a      context of the play which\u000a      sold 3872 copies.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research traces the interrelated debates on art, education and\u000a      violence from the German\u000a      Enlightenment to the present day.

Research strand (b) develops\u000a      this further by analysing\u000a      the reception of Enlightenment and Romantic thought in post-war German\u000a      film. In this regard,\u000a      Allan's research on the representation of key figures from the European\u000a      Enlightenment (including\u000a      Goya, Beethoven, Humboldt, and Kleist) in the film culture of the GDR\u000a      (DEFA) and the FRG (the\u000a      New German Cinema) illuminates the continued importance of the European\u000a      Enlightenment for an\u000a      understanding of contemporary social and political issues.\u000a    Allan's earlier research into Kleist's plays and stories [Items A &amp;\u000a      B] highlighted the ways in which\u000a      supposedly `transcendent' notions of perfection (such as `perfect'\u000a      justice, `infallible' feminine virtue,\u000a      and `irredeemable' wickedness) are exposed as man-made conventions that\u000a      reflect and maintain\u000a      the interests of a dominant class (usually a male aristocratic elite).\u000a      Kleist's work shows how this\u000a      obsession with spurious notions of `perfection' constitutes a formidable\u000a      obstacle to the\u000a      improvement of social institutions (including justice and the law). In his\u000a      current (AHRC-funded)\u000a      project `Heinrich von Kleist. Violence and Education. The Transformation\u000a      of Ethics and Aesthetics'\u000a      [Item C] Allan focuses on two key issues. First, the ways in which\u000a      eighteenth-century models of\u000a      education are adapted by Kleist in his literary works and theoretical\u000a      essays on art and morality;\u000a      second, the ways in which violence is portrayed not simply as the result\u000a      of a defective\/misguided\u000a      educational process, but in some instances as a means to a higher end. In\u000a      contrast to\u000a      Enlightenment thinkers such as Kant and Rousseau, Kleist portrays violence\u000a      as an integral part of\u000a      the modern state and, in his more nationalistic works, as the very goal of\u000a      political education.\u000a    Allan's research has also addressed the reception of Kleist (and other\u000a      key figures from the\u000a      European Enlightenment) in the post-war cinema of both West and East\u000a      Germany [Item D]. Kleist's\u000a      distinctive approach to the relationship between violence and ethics has\u000a      prompted post-war\u000a      filmmakers in the West to exploit his life and works as a means of\u000a      reflecting on the violent clashes\u000a      of the student protest movements of the late 1960s and the German\u000a      government's attempts to\u000a      justify the use of force to suppress them. In the cinema of the GDR,\u000a      Kleist and his near\u000a      contemporaries such as Goya, Humboldt, Beethoven have been mobilised to\u000a      launch a critique of a\u000a      society that, although constructed along rational `enlightened'\u000a      principles, appeared to neglect the\u000a      claims of the imagination and the desire for a holistic concept of\u000a      personality [Items E &amp; F]. By\u000a      tracing the reception of Enlightenment\/Renaissance thought from the\u000a      nineteenth century to the\u000a      present day, Allan's research argues for a model of aesthetic change based\u000a      not on an abrupt break\u000a      with the past, but rather on a process of evolution and the development of\u000a      our shared cultural\u000a      heritage.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7742","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Owing to the complexities in the survival of early printed books and\u000d\u000a      manuscripts, library catalogues and databases are often incomplete. By\u000d\u000a      their nature, such catalogues and databases often lack fuller information.\u000d\u000a      The Vernacular Aristotelianism project has improved the quality of\u000d\u000a      contextual information available on catalogue references of specific\u000d\u000a      collections, meta-catalogues and electronic resources. Furthermore, both\u000d\u000a      it and the broader `Reading Publics' research have been used to engage\u000d\u000a      with secondary school students and adult learners in the community. These\u000d\u000a      engagements have increased knowledge about the relationship between the\u000d\u000a      Latin and vernacular intellectual traditions of the Renaissance and\u000d\u000a      stimulated greater interest in the period.\u000d\u000a    Improving library catalogues and electronic databases\u000d\u000a      The research has had substantial impact on the preservation, presentation\u000d\u000a      and understanding of Renaissance holdings at libraries around the world.\u000d\u000a      The findings have been shared with librarians responsible for collections\u000d\u000a      of Italian-language manuscripts and early printed books (c.1400-c.1650)\u000a      in the UK (British Library and the John Rylands Library, Manchester); the\u000d\u000a      USA (University of Pennsylvania Library; the Newberry Library, Chicago;\u000d\u000a      Rare Book and Manuscript Library, University of Columbia; and the Harry\u000d\u000a      Ransom Research Center, Austin, Texas); and across Europe (Vatican\u000d\u000a      Library; Paris BNF; Munich BSB; and Bologna BU). Engagement with\u000d\u000a      librarians was achieved through individual consultations with project team\u000d\u000a      members, seminars and workshops.\u000d\u000a    As a result of our research, librarians at Columbia, Pennsylvania, John\u000d\u000a      Rylands (Manchester), and the Library at the National Academy of the\u000d\u000a      Lincei (Rome) have gained a better understanding of materials in their\u000d\u000a      collections and created more accurate and detailed catalogue entries. For\u000d\u000a      example, the Rare Books and Manuscript library at the University of\u000d\u000a      Pennsylvania houses more than 1800 manuscripts from the fifteenth to\u000d\u000a      eighteenth centuries as well as many printed books and manuscript\u000d\u000a      commentaries on Aristotle. Research from the AHRC project fed directly\u000d\u000a      into the work of the Assistant Curator of Manuscripts, who described how\u000d\u000a      the research has resulted in `a much better understanding of our\u000d\u000a      Aristotelian manuscripts in Italian', and that `Dr Refini identified three\u000d\u000a      manuscripts that were versions of the same text by a single author, who,\u000d\u000a      until now, received no attribution in our catalogue. He also discovered\u000d\u000a      the second half of one of the manuscripts, separated long ago and now at\u000d\u000a      Yale University. We have improved the records for all three manuscripts by\u000d\u000a      incorporating Dr Refini's research. Their relationship to our Aristotle\u000d\u000a      collection overall and to each other is now much clearer'. Refini's role\u000d\u000a      in this identification is credited on the catalogue entry. Similarly, the\u000d\u000a      Columbia University Library has incorporated information from the Vernacular\u000a        Arisotelianism project into its catalogue. At the National Academy\u000d\u000a      of the Lincei in Rome, the Head Librarian, Dr. Marco Guardo, commented\u000d\u000a      that `the study of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts owned by his\u000d\u000a      library and now included in the VARI database has brought to light several\u000d\u000a      important features of our collections', and that collaboration with the Vernacular\u000a        Aristotelianism project `allows ongoing enrichment of our knowledge\u000d\u000a      of the library holdings of the Academy. In particular, the results of the\u000d\u000a      studies carried out by colleagues at Warwick on our manuscripts have\u000d\u000a      contributed to enriching the reference materials available not only to\u000d\u000a      other scholars, but, more generally, to all users of the library [...] the\u000d\u000a      database Vernacular Aristotelianism in Renaissance Italy\u000d\u000a      represents an exemplary model of productive exchange between researchers\u000d\u000a      and librarians and curators of books'.\u000d\u000a    Our research has also informed the most important meta-catalogue of\u000d\u000a      sixteenth-century books printed in Italy, EDIT16. Users of this\u000d\u000a      fundamental tool, chiefly librarians and bibliographers, are linked\u000d\u000a      directly to our database when viewing the catalogue entry for a specific\u000d\u000a      edition, such as the 1550 commentary on Ethics by Segni or the\u000d\u000a      1551 translation of Physics by Brucioli. Since our database\u000d\u000a      comprises roughly 250 editions, EDIT16 is circulating a considerable body\u000d\u000a      of knowledge and helping scholars, librarians, and the general public\u000d\u000a      appreciate the vibrant presence of the vernacular philosophical tradition\u000d\u000a      in the sixteenth century. The Director of EDIT16, Rosaria Maria Servello,\u000d\u000a      has stated that the detailed information and bibliographical richness of\u000d\u000a      the database on Vernacular Aristotelianism in Renaissance Italy\u000d\u000a      `offers new references and opportunities for studying Aristotelian and\u000d\u000a      pseudo-Aristotelian texts. Vernacular Aristotelianism is\u000d\u000a      particularly interesting for EDIT16 for its attention to textual and\u000d\u000a      paratexual features, the individuals involved and the relations with the\u000d\u000a      Latin tradition'. Our database is also listed as a reference tool by\u000d\u000a      EDIT16.\u000d\u000a    Collaborating with the British Library and enhancing information\u000d\u000a        available in databases\u000d\u000a      A workshop held on 5 July 2013 at the British Library brought together\u000d\u000a      librarians from the Newberry Library, the British Library, the London\u000d\u000a      Library, the Bodleian Library (Oxford), the Incunabula Project at\u000d\u000a      Cambridge University Library, and directors of major cataloguing projects,\u000d\u000a      including the Consortium of European Research Libraries (CERL), EDIT16,\u000d\u000a      and the Universal Short Title Catalogue (St Andrews). The workshop, which\u000d\u000a      provided a forum for discussion between academic researchers,\u000d\u000a      bibliographers and librarians, included a demonstration of the project's\u000d\u000a      census database and a roundtable discussion of its value for supplementing\u000d\u000a      existing catalogues. Cataloguers were made aware, for instance, of how\u000d\u000a      crucial it is that catalogue entries list correctly the language in which\u000d\u000a      a work is written, enabling language-specific searches, and allowing users\u000d\u000a      gain a comprehensive picture of how knowledge was being circulated. Both\u000d\u000a      the content and the structure of the Vernacular Aristotelianism\u000d\u000a      database have proved valuable to librarians managing contemporaneous\u000d\u000a      collections. Laura Nuvoloni, Incubula cataloguer at Cambridge University\u000d\u000a      Library, commented that the workshop `provided a welcome opportunity to\u000d\u000a      ... learn about new online cumulative resources and projects that will\u000d\u000a      help the retrieval and integration of information relating to manuscript\u000d\u000a      and rare book collections ...

Digitised images of 22 manuscripts and printed works associated\u000d\u000a      with vernacular philosophical writing are on display along with contextual\u000d\u000a      information to promote understanding of Renaissance reading cultures. In\u000d\u000a      less than one month, the album had 700 likes, 271 shares and numerous\u000d\u000a      comments (e.g. `amazing and thought provoking', `genius', and a `national\u000d\u000a      treasure').\u000d\u000a    Enriching secondary education and enhancing knowledge of cultural\u000d\u000a        heritage in adult learners\u000d\u000a      The research has formed the basis for new educational initiatives for\u000d\u000a      adult learners. In 2012-13 Lines led two community courses on the Italian\u000d\u000a      Renaissance, with other members of the Italian Department: Refini,\u000d\u000a      Vanhaelen and Del Soldato. The courses were delivered in the university's\u000d\u000a      local area: the first in Kenilworth, Warwickshire (20 weeks, 17\u000d\u000a      participants) and the second in Stratford-upon-Avon (8 weeks, 14\u000d\u000a      participants). They were aimed at adult learners and the age range of\u000d\u000a      participants was 45 to 85. The research on reading publics in the Vernacular\u000a        Aristotelianism project strongly informed the structure and content\u000d\u000a      of the courses, where emphasis was placed on the relationship between\u000d\u000a      Latin and the vernacular, the contexts of philosophical discussion, and\u000d\u000a      the development of an educated public in Renaissance Italy. In course\u000d\u000a      feedback, participants demonstrated a greater understanding of the period,\u000d\u000a      and of the ways its intellectual traditions were adopted and interpreted\u000d\u000a      (60% of respondents). For many participants it was their first exposure to\u000d\u000a      the subject and stimulated their interest in further study (`I plan to\u000d\u000a      review the material from the course and to read around the subject some\u000d\u000a      more to get a better perspective'; `The course awoke in me a latent\u000d\u000a      passion for the subject that I had previously assumed was merely a passing\u000d\u000a      interest.'). Additional presentations to adult learners were made to\u000d\u000a      University of the Third Age groups in the local area (Stratford-upon-Avon\u000d\u000a      twice, Coventry, Kenilworth, and the Dene Valley) to audiences of 80+ in\u000d\u000a      September 2012.\u000d\u000a    Also in September 2012, project members visited two secondary schools in\u000d\u000a      Florence (Liceo Classico Machiavelli and Liceo Scientifico\u000d\u000a        Castelnuovo). These visits introduced the research and initial\u000d\u000a      findings, and provided a demonstration of the database. More than 100\u000d\u000a      students (aged 16-18) attended each presentation. In workshop feedback,\u000d\u000a      students showed increased knowledge about Renaissance philosophy (`the\u000d\u000a      importance of Aristotelian philosophy in the Renaissance'); the importance\u000d\u000a      of language (`Some people thought that the sciences could be translated\u000d\u000a      into the vernacular, but others thought that this wasn't possible without\u000d\u000a      devaluing the sciences'); and the re-use of classical imagery (`the\u000d\u000a      presence and importance of Classical culture throughout the ages').\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    New studies at the University of Warwick into the writing, production and\u000d\u000a      reading of philosophical works in Renaissance Italy have reassessed the\u000d\u000a      importance of works written in the vernacular language for the diffusion\u000d\u000a      of classical philosophy (1400-1650).

Numerous studies undertaken in\u000d\u000a      the past thirty years have shown that there was a renewed interest in\u000d\u000a      Aristotelian philosophy in Renaissance Italy underpinned by new\u000d\u000a      translations, commentaries, and other interpretations. These studies have,\u000d\u000a      however, focused almost exclusively on the Latin tradition of interpreting\u000d\u000a      Aristotle, which was a strong feature of philosophy teaching in the\u000d\u000a      universities and monastic schools. Our research, by contrast, has shown\u000d\u000a      the parallel interest in Aristotle in other contexts (academies, courts,\u000d\u000a      print shops) which used the vernacular to address a public that may not\u000d\u000a      have known Latin or may have felt more comfortable with learning\u000d\u000a      communicated in the vernacular languages. The research has highlighted how\u000d\u000a      such acts of `cultural transfer' produced sophisticated explanations of\u000d\u000a      ancient thought in the vernacular, thereby pinpointing &#8212; against the\u000d\u000a      prevailing scholarship &#8212; the richness of the study of philosophy in\u000d\u000a      vernacular and the interactions between the learned Latin culture and a\u000d\u000a      vernacular popular culture.\u000d\u000a    By examining how, when, and in what contexts vernacular translations of\u000d\u000a      Aristotle's works, related lectures, commentaries, and compilations were\u000d\u000a      produced and circulated, our research has uncovered a broad vernacular\u000d\u000a      reading public interested in Aristotelian philosophy. The project has\u000d\u000a      identified an extraordinary wealth of interest in ancient philosophy by\u000d\u000a      humanist writers (such as Alessandro Piccolomini, Bernardo Segni, and\u000d\u000a      Antonio Brucioli) working in the vernacular. It has also shown the\u000d\u000a      multiple ways in which vernacular interpretations of Aristotle\u000d\u000a      re-presented his thought or showed its relationship to Platonism and\u000d\u000a      Christianity.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7743","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The publication of Cullell's monograph sparked controversy in Spain,\u000a      where studies of the poes&#237;a\u000a        de la experiencia trend that had focussed on the poetic production\u000a      of the 1980s had tended to\u000a      promote uncritically a wide range of politically celebrated work. Her book\u000a      swiftly attracted fierce\u000a      criticism in the press, in newspapers such as La\u000a          Nueva Espa&#241;a. The book's publisher, Devenir,\u000a      decided to capitalise on the obvious literary polemics of Cullell's\u000a      counter-argument, rooted in her\u000a      in-depth research, about the nature and quality of this 1980s poetry. It\u000a      therefore actively\u000a      disseminated Cullell's monograph and her findings as widely as possible.\u000a      On that platform, Cullell's\u000a      research and the associated public events rekindled important debates in\u000a      contemporary Spanish\u000a      literature, and made them more accessible to non-academic audiences (for\u000a      example, readers of\u000a      poetry, visitors to museums and other cultural institutions). Her research\u000a      also inspired cultural\u000a      institutions that do not usually participate in literary activities - such\u000a      as the Ra del Rey arts centre - to\u000a      host public events.\u000a    Devenir organised a series of activities, held between 13 April and 2\u000a      June 2011, in an initiative to\u000a      bring Spanish contemporary poetry closer to the general public through\u000a      poetry readings,\u000a      roundtable discussions, performances and talks. These activities brought\u000a      together poets (including\u000a      Bego&#241;a Regueiro, Ricardo Garc&#237;a, Carmen Herrero, and Roc&#237;o Santiesteban)\u000a      and scholars from\u000a      both Spain and abroad (Diana Cullell, University of Liverpool; Germ&#225;n\u000a      Labrador, Princeton\u000a      University; Melci&#243;n Mateu, New York University; Jorge Urrutia, Universidad\u000a      Carlos III, Madrid; Jos&#233;\u000a      Mar&#237;a Mic&#243;, Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona). The events took place in\u000a      city-centre venues\u000a      that attract high numbers of visitors and customers, including the Ateneu\u000a      Barcelon&#232;s in Barcelona,\u000a      and, in Madrid, the Centro Cultural Blanquerna, the Ra del Rey arts\u000a      centre, the Casa del Libro, and\u000a      the &#193;mbito Cultural in the department store El Corte Ingl&#233;s. These events\u000a      were all extremely well\u000a      attended. The events held in the Ra del Rey arts centre and the Ateneu\u000a      Barcelon&#232;s proved\u000a      particularly popular, attracting audiences of 45 or more. Some of the\u000a      events were also broadcast\u000a      live over the internet.\u000a    Cullell's work has not only reached wider audiences, bringing poetry\u000a      closer to the general public. It\u000a      has also contributed to transforming practices for different poets and\u000a      poetic groups, leading to new\u000a      performances in museums and poetry publications. An example of this is the\u000a      literary group Otras\u000a      palabras &#8212; led by Bego&#241;a Regueiro &#8212; which developed a high profile in tertulias\u000a      (cultural salons)\u000a      and poetry performances around Madrid, following their performance in the\u000a      Ra del Rey arts centre\u000a      as part of the series of events linked with Cullell's book. This activity\u000a      also led to the publication of\u000a      Regueiro's new book, Diosas de barro (2012). Regueiro had\u000a      previously only published one book of\u000a      poetry. Her involvement in the impact activities surrounding Cullell's\u000a      book drew the attention of\u000a      publishing houses and readers to her own work and she was subsequently\u000a      invited to publish\u000a      Diosas de barro. This was launched in Madrid and Seville, and was\u000a      very well received. Regueiro\u000a      has since been asked to publish her next poetry book with Amargord and\u000a      Playa de Akaba, two\u000a      important poetry publishing houses in Spain. A further example of the\u000a      impact of Cullell's work on\u000a      poets is that, in the course of one of the public events, the poet Maria\u000a      Antonia Ortega said that, for\u000a      the first time, she had been given a voice. Additionally, Devenir, the\u000a      publisher, which experienced\u000a      an increase of 35% in hits to its website, also recognised the impact of\u000a      the events. The chief editor\u000a      wrote: `This series of events, in my opinion, had a great and intense\u000a      impact. You clearly settled the\u000a      issues - for anyone who was willing to understand the truth [about the\u000a      poetic trend]. In my view, it\u000a      was all extremely positive, and I think we managed to reach a wide and\u000a      varied audience.'\u000a    In tandem with the events organised by Devenir, Cullell was invited to\u000a      talk about Spanish\u000a      contemporary poetry at the `Tertulia Literaria Hispanoamericana Rafael\u000a      Montesinos', Colegio\u000a      Mayor Nuestra Se&#241;ora de Guadalupe, Madrid (12 April 2011) and to talk on\u000a      new technologies and\u000a      poetry at the literary cafe `Libertad 8', Madrid (2 February 2012).\u000a    Alongside its academic reception, Cullell's book was reviewed in the\u000a      Spanish newspaper La\u000a          Nueva\u000a          Espa&#241;a (referred to above) and in the online blog La\u000a        Mirada actual. Cullell was also interviewed for\u000a      the Spanish online newspaper SolidaridadDigital.\u000a    These activities have also raised Cullell's public profile more locally.\u000a      Since 2010 Cullell has\u000a      organised an annual Writer in Residence event in Liverpool, featuring\u000a      contemporary Spanish\u000a      authors and including public events. For example, in March 2012 and March\u000a      2013 public readings\u000a      by Spanish, Catalan and Basque poets (August Bover, Kirmen Uribe, Virginia\u000a      Cant&#243;, and Itxaso\u000a      Paya) at the city's Bluecoat Centre attracted local audiences of some 40\u000a      people. This series of\u000a      events is on-going, and will see Cullell take a lead in departmental KE\u000a      and impact activities. In the\u000a      framework of her most recent research project (on xarnego poetry -\u000a      Catalan poetry written in\u000a      Spanish by Spanish immigrants into Catalonia or their descendants), she\u000a      will organise a workshop\u000a      on Translating Cultures, to be held at the Instituto Cervantes in\u000a      Manchester in mid- to late 2014.\u000a      This event will be free and open to the general public. She will also\u000a      organise a workshop-linked\u000a      public poetry reading, to be held at the Liverpool Bluecoat Centre and she\u000a      will collaborate with the\u000a      Instituto Cervantes in the Manchester Literary Festival in October 2014,\u000a      writing reviews and\u000a      organizing a xarnego poetry session.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Diana Cullell's study of contemporary Spanish poetry (published 2010) has\u000a      illuminated the\u000a      relationship between the power of the State and new writing in\u000a      democratising Spain, and has\u000a      provided new ways of understanding poetic traditions. Her direct\u000a      engagement with public events\u000a      and poets since 2010 has enhanced that impact and is ongoing. Spanish\u000a      readers, as well as\u000a      audiences beyond Spain, have acquired new understanding of poetic practice\u000a      and of tradition and\u000a      the politics of culture. The poets themselves have found new readers while\u000a      Cullell's critical\u000a      anatomy of poetics has provided them with tools for reflecting on their\u000a      own practices.

This research was initiated\u000a      when Cullell was a postgraduate at the University of Manchester between\u000a      2005 and 2008.\u000a      However, the book was written, revised and disseminated while she was in\u000a      post at the University of\u000a      Liverpool. Cullell was appointed to Liverpool as a University Teacher in\u000a      October 2008, and then to\u000a      a lectureship in October 2011.\u000a    Cullell's book offers an analysis of the history of a particular poetic\u000a      tradition in Spain. It is structured\u000a      around an examination and assessment of so-called poes&#237;a de la\u000a        experiencia (poetry of\u000a      experience). Drawn from the critical work of Robert Langbaum on English\u000a      poetry, the term poes&#237;a\u000a        de la experiencia was originally applied to Spanish writing of the\u000a      1950s - notably the work of Luis\u000a      Cernuda &#8212; which used poetic techniques to evoke sensory experience in the\u000a      reader. The term was\u000a      revived in post-Francoist Spain in the 1980s to characterise a type of\u000a      poetry that emphasised the\u000a      democratic themes of everyday life and managed, as Cullell contends in her\u000a      book, `to establish\u000a      itself via metaliterary elements as well as socio-political\u000a      considerations' (p.246). Cullell argues that\u000a      the new `poets of experience' of the 1980s constituted a dominant literary\u000a      school, such that other\u000a      poetic voices were marginalised, including those of practitioners of\u000a      something more like the original\u000a      poes&#237;a de la experiencia. The frequent use of the term in critical\u000a      discourse in the 1980s served the\u000a      interests of the Socialist State in displaying their promotion of culture,\u000a      and served the interests of\u000a      the poets whose work was celebrated and recognised with awards. In her\u000a      book, Cullell contends\u000a      that the use of this term proposed a false continuity between the earlier\u000a      and later bodies of work:\u000a      `The misrepresentation of the poes&#237;a de la experiencia label and\u000a      the creation of a deceiving canon\u000a      that blurred literary foundations and mixed up poetic affinities created\u000a      false frontiers and poetic\u000a      divergences that wrongly excluded important poets and works from the\u000a      experiential ranks' (p.254).\u000a    Cullell's project aimed to re-evaluate poes&#237;a de la experiencia\u000a      both as an existing body of work and\u000a      as a poetic tradition, on the grounds that `ultimately, poes&#237;a de la\u000a        experiencia is not only a style or\u000a      an aesthetic, it is also a poetic essence that can appear at various\u000a      levels in different and diverse\u000a      authors. It is and should be an essence owned by no particular trend'\u000a      (p.254). The project involved\u000a      analysing the origins of the tradition in the 1950s, the processes by\u000a      which the poetry of the 1980s\u000a      and its legitimating critical discourse had become established, and the\u000a      contentious hypothesis that\u000a      certain collections of poetry from the 1990s and beyond should be viewed\u000a      as more representative\u000a      of an evolving aesthetic than the politically showcased poetry of the\u000a      1980s. To this end, the\u000a      research deployed a theoretical framework which included concepts from\u000a      phenomenological\u000a      studies and cultural sociology. Methodologically, it examined the changing\u000a      notions of experience\u000a      and taste, and the evolution of conceptions of the human body as a focal\u000a      point both of lived\u000a      experience and creative work, thus placing poetics in a sociological\u000a      context.\u000a    Cullell was ultimately able to argue for a radical rethink of the\u000a      contours of the poetic tradition\u000a      studied, and was also able to show how political and social factors &#8212; the\u000a      alignment of poets to the\u000a      power of the State &#8212; had contributed to a misleading promotion of poes&#237;a\u000a        de la experiencia as a\u000a      culturally dominant literary practice in the 1980s. The controversy that\u000a      her book encountered\u000a      confirmed the force of her findings, since it was read well beyond the\u000a      circles of academic literary\u000a      criticism, and was even attacked in the national press. The initial impact\u000a      thus resulted\u000a      spontaneously from the nature of the research findings, whose relevance\u000a      equally captured the\u000a      attention of a wider public interested in Spain's post-Francoist political\u000a      order. Subsequent\u000a      dissemination activity served to enhance this impact. Beyond this,\u000a      Cullell's analysis of the key\u000a      components of a poes&#237;a de la experiencia in terms of the\u000a      interaction between text and body\u000a      provided a basis for poets to reflect on their own practice and their\u000a      place in Spain's wider literary\u000a      history and landscape.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7744","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The activities detailed below enriched the cultural life of the\u000a      population of Hardelot itself, of French\u000a      and international visitors to the town, and of the employees of Tata\u000a      Group.

Anticipating its importance for the town's prestige and\u000a      future heritage tourism\u000a      from India, the Mayor's office and the Hardelot Tourist Office allocated\u000a      US$ 21,000 to support the\u000a      events. TG matched this funding, in the interests of its company profile\u000a      in France and Europe. The\u000a      Tourist Office and the Mayor decided to make the exhibition the\u000a      centrepiece of Hardelot's cultural\u000a      offering throughout the summer of 2011, and all official events, from\u000a      public lectures and fashion\u000a      shows to hands-on art workshops for children aged 4 to 6, had an Indian\u000a      theme that year. A full-colour\u000a      brochure publicising the exhibition and these events, and including\u000a      all dates and times, was\u000a      prepared by the Tourist Office. The opening ceremony on 29 July 2011 was\u000a      attended by locals\u000a      from Hardelot (some of whom live in the properties once owned by the\u000a      Tatas), the Chief of Mission\u000a      at the Indian Embassy in Paris, the Mayor of Hardelot, the regional Head\u000a      of Tata Communications,\u000a      and a chief archivist from TCA, Pune, India.\u000a    In the event, some 14,000 visitors, both locals and tourists from other\u000a      parts of France, Belgium, the\u000a      Netherlands and the UK viewed the exhibition. It was also covered\u000a      extensively in the media. The\u000a      coverage included a feature on France 3 Television broadcast as part of\u000a      the evening news bulletin\u000a      on 29 July 2011. This included a short interview with Magedera and with\u000a      locals expressing their\u000a      attachment to their town's connection with India. Two locals testify to\u000a      the fact that before the\u000a      exhibition they did not know who the Tatas were, how many properties they\u000a      owned in the town, or\u000a      how important TG had become. In India, through a copyright exchange\u000a      agreement, Tata Central\u000a      Archives - India's oldest company archive and a key beneficiary - has been\u000a      able to enhance its\u000a      collections with the material from the exhibition and make it available to\u000a      people in India.\u000a    \u000a      Public outreach and capacity building\u000a    \u000a    The research for this project also unearthed how, during the First World\u000a      War, the British Indian\u000a      Army set up a hospital in a Hardelot hotel to treat injured Indian\u000a      soldiers (panel 11 of the exhibition\u000a      was devoted to this period). Archival research done under Magedera's\u000a      guidance in the UK by Dr\u000a      William Leigh (a mature undergraduate student in History at the University\u000a      of Liverpool), led to an\u000a      illustrated public lecture on \" Les soldats indiens &#224; Hardelot pendant la\u000a      Grande Guerre &#187;, delivered\u000a      by Dr Leigh in Hardelot on 5 August 2011.

A further demonstration of the\u000a      exhibition's successful capacity\u000a      building is that, through the involvement of local officials and news\u000a      media, it raised awareness of\u000a      the presence of First-World-War Indian war graves in the region during a\u000a      commemoration visit to\u000a      Hardelot by Commonwealth academics (from Australia, New Zealand, India and\u000a      Canada), 15-16\u000a      September 2011 (see Sources to corroborate the impact, below).\u000a    \u000a      Legacy impact in 2012: permanent display of exhibition panels\u000a    \u000a    In February 2012, Tata Communications (a multinational telecommunications\u000a      infrastructure\u000a      company with 7,700 staff and a revenue of US$ 2.6 billion in 2011)\u000a      requested permission to\u000a      reproduce fifteen of the exhibition panels for permanent display in the\u000a      staff offices of their\u000a      European headquarters in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris.

He has carried out all of the research detailed in this case\u000a      study while in post at\u000a      Liverpool. Tata Group (TG) is an Indian multinational enterprise founded\u000a      in 1868. With its UK\u000a      workforce of 45,000 at Jaguar Land Rover and other companies, TG is the\u000a      largest foreign\u000a      employer in this country, where it has been active since 1907. TG's first\u000a      investments in Europe\u000a      were made in Hardelot, around the time of the town's foundation in 1905 as\u000a      a private resort on the\u000a      Channel coast.\u000a    The research which underpins this case study began in 2008, when the\u000a      hitherto unexplored\u000a      presence of Tata in Europe was revealed as a result of Magedera's research\u000a      into the life of the\u000a      Frenchwoman, Suzanne Bri&#232;re (1880-1923). She featured in a wider project\u000a      on non-English\u000a      European women (`Indian Videshini') who have attained positions of\u000a      leadership in India since the\u000a      1890s. This in turn developed out of an AHRC-funded study of\u000a      Representations of India in French\u000a      Literature and Culture that commenced in 2006 (item 1 in References to the\u000a      research, below).\u000a      Bri&#232;re's husband, R.D. Tata, was one of the four original partners of TG.\u000a      With their family of five\u000a      children, the Tatas played an active part in Hardelot between its\u000a      foundation in 1905 and the start of\u000a      the First World War in 1914. Magedera's initial research on Suzanne Bri&#232;re\u000a      was carried out at Tata\u000a      Central Archives (TCA) in Pune, India, in 2008. From December 2010,\u000a      Magedera also made two\u000a      research visits to Hardelot to evaluate local sources relating to TG.\u000a    Among the materials found in India and France were postcards and other\u000a      correspondence which\u000a      threw light on the ways in which Suzanne Bri&#232;re negotiated her dual\u000a      French-Indian identity in\u000a      linguistic and cultural terms. This became the subject of a 2013 book\u000a      chapter by Magedera (item 2\u000a      in References to the research, below). A further significant finding arose\u000a      from Magedera's\u000a      examination both of property deeds relating to TG's investments and of the\u000a      testimony of those who\u000a      ran the Hardelot holding company. These indicate that investment by this\u000a      branch of the Tata family\u000a      in Hardelot extended beyond private interests to the purchase of\u000a      commercial properties in the\u000a      company's name in 1905, possibly the first case of inward investment into\u000a      Europe by an Indian\u000a      company. New insights into the dialogue between European culture and\u000a      Indian industry emerged\u000a      from exploration of the links between Hardelot and the automotive and\u000a      aviation industries. Driving\u000a      and flying were publicized as key leisure activities in Hardelot, and\u000a      these became both personal\u000a      passions and important business concerns of TG. The aviator-entrepreneur\u000a      Louis Bl&#233;riot and his\u000a      pilots landed their aeroplanes on the hard sand beach at low tide. Suzanne\u000a      Bri&#232;re made her\u000a      maiden flight in 1913 and her son spent his childhood among aeroplanes. In\u000a      1932, he founded\u000a      Tata Indian Airways, which became Air India in 1953. Not surprisingly, the\u000a      concentration in\u000a      Hardelot of prominent business families such as the Merciers (champagne),\u000a      the Bl&#233;riots (aviation),\u000a      and others representing manufacturing and textiles, meant that the resort\u000a      functioned as a locus of\u000a      technology transfer. More generally, this research contributed to the\u000a      argument that Magedera\u000a      developed in his book chapter (item 2 in References to the research,\u000a      below), that Indian elites have\u000a      maintained their position in the face of multiple challenges by\u000a      strategically incorporating foreigners\u000a      of a particular kind.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7745","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Rosenhaft's research on non-Jewish Holocaust victims has enhanced\u000d\u000a      individuals' capacity to\u000d\u000a      engage positively with issues of racism, with potential impacts for\u000d\u000a      community relations.

An undergraduate volunteer whom Rosenhaft\u000d\u000a      invited to lead some\u000d\u000a      workshops observed changes in the participants. She commented that: `The\u000d\u000a      TRG expanded the\u000d\u000a      young people's understanding of gypsies [...] and broke down the negative\u000d\u000a      stereotypes\u000d\u000a      surrounding them that a number of the group had before the session.'

The workshops were `better than\u000d\u000a      school', and the study\u000d\u000a      involved was `important [...] because it makes you understand'; `looking\u000d\u000a      at other victims made it\u000d\u000a      more understandable'.

Her talk on Blacks under Nazism at the German\u000d\u000a      Historical Institute\u000d\u000a      London (March 2012) attracted nearly a hundred people, the largest and\u000d\u000a      most diverse audience\u000d\u000a      ever recorded for a lecture there. She subsequently spoke at the Wiener\u000d\u000a      Library in the context of\u000d\u000a      Black History Month. One listener commented: `I walked away feeling I had\u000d\u000a      really benefited from\u000d\u000a      that talk, and that not attending would have done me a great disservice.'\u000d\u000a      In May 2013, she\u000d\u000a      addressed public meetings organised by Baptist congregations in\u000d\u000a      Berlin-Friedrichshain and\u000d\u000a      Eberswalde (about eighty attendees altogether). Those communities had\u000d\u000a      hosted Africans visiting\u000d\u000a      Germany between 1886 and 1914 (the subject of the lectures), and\u000d\u000a      Eberswalde is also notorious\u000d\u000a      for a 1989 racist murder.

Rosenhaft\u000d\u000a      subsequently conducted extensive archival research and interviews to\u000d\u000a      gather further contextual\u000d\u000a      and biographical information. The project is a study in intercultural\u000d\u000a      relations which captures and\u000d\u000a      explains the everyday experiences of Gypsies in twentieth-century Germany,\u000d\u000a      with specific\u000d\u000a      reference to the sources and consequences of Nazi persecution. While it\u000d\u000a      has long been\u000d\u000a      understood that the Gypsies suffered forms of popular and institutional\u000d\u000a      racism even before the\u000d\u000a      Nazi takeover, this research problematizes the question of how everyday\u000d\u000a      racism related to\u000d\u000a      National-Socialist racial policies. It demonstrates how a shifting balance\u000d\u000a      between everyday and\u000d\u000a      genocidal racism shaped the experience of the victims. Between 2001 and\u000d\u000a      2010, Rosenhaft\u000d\u000a      published six book chapters and four journal articles on these topics, all\u000d\u000a      single-authored.\u000d\u000a    The second project began in 2003. It examines the everyday experiences of\u000d\u000a      Africans and the\u000d\u000a      emerging black community in Germany between the colonial period and the\u000d\u000a      1950s, focussing\u000d\u000a      specifically on the careers of the first generation of African colonial\u000d\u000a      migrants to Germany as well as\u000d\u000a      their families (1884-1960). The project won AHRC funding in 2005.\u000d\u000a      Rosenhaft acted as PI and\u000d\u000a      collaborated with project researcher Robbie Aitken, who was in post at\u000d\u000a      Liverpool from 2005 to\u000d\u000a      2010 before moving to a lecturing position at Sheffield Hallam University.\u000d\u000a      The findings of this\u000d\u000a      second project show that, in the context of colonial and post-colonial\u000d\u000a      Black-White relations,\u000d\u000a      Germans' notions of `race' were unstable and constantly negotiated. In\u000d\u000a      addition, the dimensions\u000d\u000a      and trajectory of the Nazi attack on Germany's black population are\u000d\u000a      brought into clearer light,\u000d\u000a      especially the extent of the use (as with Gypsies) of compulsory\u000d\u000a      sterilisation to prevent the growth\u000d\u000a      of the `mixed-race' population. Between 2003 and 2013, the project\u000d\u000a      generated three articles, four\u000d\u000a      book chapters and two encyclopaedia entries, all single-authored, as well\u000d\u000a      as a monograph, an\u000d\u000a      edited volume and four book chapters that are co-authored. All are based\u000d\u000a      on extensive archival\u000d\u000a      research and interviews.\u000d\u000a    These projects stand as complementary studies of forms of racism which\u000d\u000a      survived World War II\u000d\u000a      largely unchallenged. The projects have unearthed large bodies of\u000d\u000a      qualitative data in the form of\u000d\u000a      photographs and personal testimony which bring to life the stories of\u000d\u000a      ordinary people living under\u000d\u000a      conditions of discrimination and persecution. They also offer new\u000d\u000a      understandings, since they\u000d\u000a      demonstrate that Nazi policy was less the climax of all preceding racisms\u000d\u000a      than a genuinely radical\u000d\u000a      project of redefining race. But they also demonstrate that the `racial\u000d\u000a      state' remained a work in\u000d\u000a      progress, with forms of everyday racism sometimes offering protection to\u000d\u000a      potential victims.\u000d\u000a      Moreover, in view of continuing discrimination and violence against black\u000d\u000a      people and Gypsies,\u000d\u000a      these projects have ethical implications for contemporary multi-ethnic\u000d\u000a      societies that have allowed\u000d\u000a      follow-on impact work through educational and advocacy initiatives.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8862","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A key feature of Kelly`s work on identity has been close collaborative\u000a      work with Russians, both as members of the project team and as informants.\u000a      The research starts from, and feeds back into, the experiences of members\u000a      of the general public. The interviews were often highly significant for\u000a      the participants and members of their family, for example, sometimes\u000a      interviewees would air experiences they had not talked about before\u000a      because they thought no one was interested. Their memories also helped to\u000a      suggest new lines of investigation. For example, a chapter of Kelly`s book\u000a      on Petersburg [&#167;3.6] is devoted to the importance of districts, something\u000a      almost never remarked on by foreign commentators but which turns out to be\u000a      very important to locals. During his work on interviewing Russian &#233;migr&#233;s\u000a      in Britain, Byford became an informant about life in the UK for\u000a      interviewees who had almost no contact with locals, and so on. In turn,\u000a      this new content has facilitated impact at a variety of different levels,\u000a      including:\u000a    A new view of contemporary Russia for policy-makers and other\u000a        professionals\u000a      In 2009, Kelly gave a keynote address on Russian national identity at the\u000a      UBS Arts Forum, `Go East: Contemporary Arts in Central and Eastern\u000a      Europe`, attended by gallery owners and museum staff from across the\u000a      German-speaking world. This was intended to give professionals who have\u000a      increasing contact with the art scene in Russia and other post-socialist\u000a      countries an immersion in the cultural background [i].\u000a      She also addressed the Youth Policy Conference at Upshaw, County Durham,\u000a      speaking about Russian childhood to an audience of social workers and\u000a      other professionals involved in work with children and young people [ii].\u000a      Other ways in which research material from the projects has been used\u000a      include a satellite investigation sponsored by Geschichtswerkstatt Europa\u000a      that included a play about the life of migrants into Russian cities based\u000a      on interview transcripts, performed at the British Consulate in Petersburg\u000a      [iii]. This provided the mainly expatriate audience with\u000a      a view of a side of Russian life with which they have little direct\u000a      contact.\u000a    The Oxford conferences on national identity were attended by a number of\u000a      policy-makers, including Elizabeth Teague, analyst of Russian Politics at\u000a      the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office [iv]. Andy\u000a      Byford was invited to a briefing at the Russian Embassy in London in order\u000a      to discuss perceptions of `Russianness` among &#233;migr&#233;s, as part of the\u000a      Russian state`s efforts to engage in nation-building abroad. The interview\u000a      database [&#167;3.8] has been used not only by scholars and students for their\u000a      work, but also by creative writers and by those working in applied areas\u000a      of social science, such as Erica Richardson, who works for the World Heath\u000a      Organisation and consulted the interviews with paediatricians and other\u000a      medical professionals working with children. In her words: `Health care\u000a      workers are the most valuable resource in any health system and their\u000a      attitude towards changes in the system determines whether reforms will be\u000a      implemented or undermined. Therefore, it is imperative to hear their\u000a      voices - this doesn't always happen.` [1]\u000a    Contributing to public debates in the UK\u000a      The studies of Russian identity [&#167;3.6, &#167;3.7] have generated a good deal of\u000a      media interest, and Kelly is regularly approached to contribute to\u000a      discussions based on her expertise in this area, in turn raising public\u000a      awareness and understanding of the topic. As well as various invitations\u000a      to discuss `Putin`s lifestyle` which were turned down, there were many\u000a      serious requests - for example, Catriona Kelly appeared on BBC Radio`s\u000a      `The World Tonight` in order to discuss the Pussy Riot case (September\u000a      2012) and was invited to take part in a discussion of modern Russia on BBC\u000a      Newsnight (August 2013, had to be declined). Public events have included\u000a      an appearance by Kelly at a discussion of modern Russia at Waterstones\u000a      Bookshop, Oxford (9 May 2013), to mark the shortlisting of the first ever\u000a      Pushkin House Russian Book Prize in 2013 (Kelly appeared with the writer\u000a      Andrew Miller and the historian Robert Service) [v]. A\u000a      critical review written by Kelly of Oliver Bullough`s The Last Man in\u000a        Russia, published in the Guardian (7 June 2013), about the\u000a      alcohol-fuelled decline of Russia, was described by the books editor of The\u000a        Guardian as `such a good piece` and has led to further commissions.\u000a      The article provoked a heated debate in the reader comments with around 40\u000a      posts discussing Kelly`s arguments, the trends in alcohol consumption in\u000a      Russia compared to other countries, and if the author, or more generally,\u000a      if the West was `Russophobic` or not.\u000a    Engaging with Russians in debates about national identity\u000a      Several of the project workshops were held in Russia, and were extremely\u000a      well attended, including by representatives of heritage preservation\u000a      organisations, who were able to put their views forward also at `Global\u000a      Aspirations and Pastiche Identity`, a conference organised by Kelly and\u000a      Professor Andreas Sch&#246;nle at QMUL. The conference was attended, for\u000a      example, by representatives of Moscow Architecture Preservation Society [vi].\u000a      Kelly has also taken part (in April 2013) in a Russian TV debate about the\u000a      destruction of architecture in Soviet Leningrad. Her work has a high\u000a      online presence with Russians: for example, Children's World\u000a      [&#167;3.3] was described by the leading poet and influential blogger, Linor\u000a      Goralik, as one of the best ten studies of Soviet everyday life [vii],\u000a      and in an online interview, the famous Russian historian Evgeny Anisimov\u000a      described her book on Pavlik Morozov [&#167;3.5], translated into Russian in\u000a      2009, as a model of how to write history [viii]. At a\u000a      different level of engagement, Kelly is a regular user of Facebook, with\u000a      over 500 `friends`, many of them Russian, and uses the site primarily as a\u000a      resource for discussions about contemporary Russia and a way of locating\u000a      research materials. Kelly`s lecture talking about the history of the\u000a      Museum of the History of Leningrad (December 2012) was selected as a text\u000a      for dissemination on the online portal `Lectorium`, which is a Russian\u000a      non-profit organisation providing access to educational materials of\u000a      outstanding quality.\u000a    Increasing knowledge and understanding among the general public\u000a      In August 2012, Kelly was invited by Dmitry Esakov, director of the\u000a      cultural programme for the Volga Dream line offering high-quality river\u000a      cruises for visitors to Russia, to present a programme of lectures during\u000a      a cruise from Moscow to St Petersburg [ix]. In his\u000a      letter of invitation, Esakov wrote: `we try to invite guest speakers who\u000a      are connected to Russia professionally and can speak about the subject\u000a      passionately.

She produced a short citation about the\u000a      importance of the archive for use in publicity material, and has been\u000a      invited to present an introduction to a series of CDs being produced by a\u000a      company in Germany using this material.\u000a    In December 2012, Kelly was contacted by the Irish artist, Gareth\u000a      Kennedy, commissioned by a local authority in Petersburg to produce `The\u000a      Last Wooden House of Kupchino`[x]. Kennedy wrote: `I have been\u000a      reading with great interest your \"Making a Home on the Neva\" which I came\u000a      across online.` Kelly provided Kennedy with local contacts and a briefing\u000a      session on Petersburg history, which informed Kennedy`s installation and a\u000a      film made about it.[5]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Kelly`s studies of national identity in Russia seek to\u000a      challenge stereotypes about enduring traditions of political oppression\u000a      and social decay as the culture`s main characteristics. Focusing on\u000a      everyday life rather than high politics, they work towards an\u000a      understanding of change within Russian culture, and of the part played by\u000a      factors such as generation and locality in producing often very diverse\u000a      forms of self-expression and self-understanding. A central topic is the\u000a      role of social memory, whether as a force of solidarity or as an engine of\u000a      argument. Kelly`s work draws directly on collaborations with Russian\u000a      scholars and informants and has been widely noted in media and online\u000a      discussions within the country, as well as informing media discussion of\u000a      Russia and social policy work in the UK and elsewhere in the West.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Oxford\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"498817","Name":"St. Petersburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"498817","Name":"Petersburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"524901","Name":"Moscow"},{"GeoNamesId":"498817","Name":"St Petersburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2022890","Name":"Khabarovsk"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[1] Catriona Kelly (ed.)

The books moved\u000a      beyond the fixation on political resistance versus conformity, that\u000a      preoccupied researchers during the Cold War, to look at the way in which\u000a      Russian (and later Soviet) identity was shaped by specific social\u000a      practices such as consumption.\u000a    Kelly`s later research has also employed interdisciplinary methodologies,\u000a      and has focused on two key areas. `Childhood in Russia: A Social and\u000a        Cultural History, 1890-1991' (2003-2006; supported by the Leverhulme\u000a      Trust, Principal Investigator Kelly, post-doctoral fellow Andy Byford)\u000a      addressed the centrality of children`s welfare and development to the\u000a      legitimacy of Soviet rule, and the creative interest in childhood that\u000a      transformed the social sciences, particularly psychology, and the arts in\u000a      twentieth-century Russia. In Taubman`s review (see &#167;3.3), `She [Kelly]\u000a      combed government archives for information on education, orphanages,\u000a      social services, juvenile delinquency, and the changing legal status of\u000a      children; conducted personal interviews; mined memoir literature; and\u000a      studied children's literature, theatre and film, children's games and\u000a      leisure activities, and childbearing\/child rearing`.

A\u000a      by-product of this work was Comrade Pavlik [&#167;3.5], in which Kelly\u000a      dismantled the myths surrounding Pavlik Morozov, the boy who was said to\u000a      have denounced his father to the Soviet authorities, and whose murder in\u000a      1932, almost certainly as the result of a family row, was exploited as\u000a      `evidence` of the malign activities of a ring of kulaks opposed to\u000a      collectivisation.\u000a    `National Identity in Russia from 1961' sponsored by a major grant\u000a      from the AHRC (2007-2011; Principal Investigator Kelly, Co-investigator\u000a      Professor Hilary Pilkington, U. of Warwick), brought together a core team\u000a      of 9 academics from the UK and Russia in a range of different fields\u000a      (anthropology, sociology, and history, as well as literature and cultural\u000a      studies); there were also two doctoral students attached to the project,\u000a      one based in Oxford. Two major international conferences in 2009,\u000a      `National Identity in Russia 1: Traditions` and `National Identity in\u000a      Russia 2: Migration` brought academics from Western Europe, America,\u000a      Australia, China and various parts of the former Soviet Union (including\u000a      Armenia and Kazakhstan as well as Russia) to Oxford for discussions. There\u000a      were also several workshops, and participants in the project presented\u000a      conference papers and lectures at a range of other venues (the total\u000a      number of outputs stands at well over 100, and publications are already in\u000a      the pipeline). Key outputs include Kelly`s own St Petersburg: Shadows\u000a        of the Past [&#167;3.6], a study of the relationship between memory and\u000a      city identity in the country`s former capital, 1957-present, and the essay\u000a      collection, Soviet and Post- Soviet Identities [&#167;3.7], with\u000a      articles by a number of the project participants.

Kuhn's work,\u000a      intended to address this unevenness, has educational, commercial and\u000a      general cultural impact, felt above all in schools, theatres and the book\u000a      trade. Besides translating and editing important texts himself, Kuhn has\u000a      worked closely with other translators, has engaged with schools and\u000a      theatres, and has led and participated in theatre workshops with the Young\u000a      Vic and others. Above all, since 2002 he has been the sole general editor\u000a      of the `Methuen Drama' Brecht list, commissioning and approving new titles\u000a      and translations and initiating new publications of every variety.\u000a    Improving the quality of translation and increasing accessibility of\u000a        Brecht publications\u000a    The mediation of Brecht's work through reliable translations, both in\u000a      book form and in the theatre, makes a crucial contribution to the cultural\u000a      life of the English-speaking world. Brecht's plays have become a\u000a      cornerstone of the Methuen Drama list, now published by Bloomsbury.\u000a      Methuen Drama publish books for theatre-goers, students, scholars,\u000a      practitioners, actors and those wishing to pursue a career in the theatre\u000a      industry. The editorial and publishing team relies heavily on Kuhn's\u000a      expertise in reaching publishing decisions about Brecht translations. Kuhn\u000a      coordinates and oversees the whole Brecht programme, doing hands-on\u000a      editing for many volumes. He also provides guidance which significantly\u000a      influences the publication choices of the German publisher, Suhrkamp, and\u000a      the Brecht Estate. `His role and expertise is unusually significant: we\u000a      work closely with the Brecht Estate on all new titles under consideration.\u000a      Tom Kuhn produces a reader report on every new play translation that we\u000a      are sent with a view to publishing it to coincide with a theatre\u000a      production. This report is not only considered by ourselves as Brecht's\u000a      English publisher, it is sent also to the Brecht Estate who consider it\u000a      when making their decision whether to licence the publication or not.' The\u000a      commissioning editor also states `His wide connections among Brecht\u000a      scholars have assisted our publishing programme by his soliciting\u000a      proposals from suitably qualified authors.' [1]\u000a    Methuen Drama currently has forty nine Brecht titles in print.\u000a      Twenty-three titles have been published while Tom Kuhn has officially been\u000a      Methuen Drama's Brecht General Editor, with an additional three titles for\u000a      which he was co-editor. [text removed for publication]. [1]\u000a    International access to Brecht through English-language texts\u000a    The impact of Kuhn's research extends far beyond the UK. According to the\u000a      publisher, these books are also widely distributed overseas. Bloomsbury\u000a      markets many of its titles directly in the USA and in other countries\u000a      internationally. The share of the North American market is expanding\u000a      quickly thanks to an agreement between Suhrkamp, the heirs, and\u000a      Bloomsbury, achieved through Kuhn's mediation. The largest\u000a      English-language market, after North America, is Australia and New\u000a      Zealand, but English is also the vehicular language by which publics in\u000a      the Indian sub-continent, Asia (e.g. Singapore) and other regions\u000a      worldwide gain access to Brecht. [1]\u000a    Enabling the teaching of Brecht's life, politics and theatre theory\u000a    Since Brecht is among the few classic and widely studied authors who\u000a      engage directly with economic and political questions, the availability of\u000a      the Methuen editions for educational purposes helps to nurture a\u000a      politically literate public. Kuhn has had an immediate educational impact\u000a      through the Student Editions, which are widely used in schools, both in\u000a      Britain and elsewhere, and contain an essay on Brecht's life, politics and\u000a      theatre theory by Kuhn which is already becoming one of the standard\u000a      introductions to Brecht. [text removed for publication]\u000a    The Methuen Drama titles feature in the Bloomsbury Drama Online Library[i]\u000a      launched in 2012, hence are readily accessible for educational purposes.\u000a      Both student editions appear online.\u000a    In 2013 Kuhn gave educational talks in connection with the RSC Galileo\u000a      production primarily for students of physics; and on 17 June there was a\u000a      `Poet in the City' event at the King's Place, London, led by Kuhn and\u000a      David Constantine, devoted to Brecht's poetry, song and its translation\u000a      into English (which attracted an audience of some 250 &#8212; schoolchildren,\u000a      actors, scholars, directors, as well as members of the general public) [ii].\u000a      This and similar programmes will visit several other cities (and literary\u000a      festivals) in the coming years. Such wider educational and cultural\u000a      engagement is typical, and a cultural programme and outreach is an\u000a      important feature of the AHRC-funded project `Brecht into English'.\u000a    Translations of Brecht plays edited by Kuhn have been used by others for\u000a      educational purposes. Fear and Misery of the Third Reich tr.\u000a      Willett has been toured around schools by Scene Productions a number of\u000a      times since 2008 [2] `offering students and adults the\u000a      chance to re-discover theatre in fresh, bold and imaginative ways.'\u000a      According to feedback from teachers: `Brecht is no longer feared by my\u000a      students.'; `Excellent. You engaged the students with both a difficult\u000a      text and techniques which are often hard for them to grasp. Well done and\u000a      thank you.'[iii]\u000a    Providing new impulses for the staging of Brecht's works\u000a    Brecht is an important figure in theatre repertoire, with over 30\u000a      professional [2] and many more amateur productions [3]\u000a      in the UK alone in the relevant period. Twelve professional productions\u000a      featured translations made and edited by Kuhn at theatres around the UK [2].\u000a      Major UK and international productions were:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aMother Courage tr. Kushner, in New York (originally 2006, dir.\u000a        George C. Wolfe, featured in John Walter's film Theatre of War\u000a        2008, and reprised Oct 2009) and at the National Theatre (Sept\u000a        2009, dir. Deborah Warner);\u000a      \u000aThe Good Soul of Szechuan tr. Harrower, at the Young Vic\u000a        (May 2008, dir. Richard Jones);\u000a      \u000aThe Caucasian Chalk Circle tr. McGuinness (Courtyard Theatre\u000a        (2008) Fluellen Theatre (2010) and Bruiser Theatre Co (2011)); and tr.\u000a        Beaton (2009 by Shared Experience at the Nottingham Playhouse, dir.\u000a        Nancy Meckler);\u000a      \u000aA Life of Galileo tr. Ravenhill, at the RSC Stratford\u000a        (February 2013, dir. Roxana Silbert).\u000a    \u000a    Though it is hard to estimate total audience figures for these\u000a      productions, some examples can be given: the National Theatre calculated\u000a      that 61,000 people saw the production of Mother Courage over 61\u000a      performances, playing to 90% of box office capacity [4]; the\u000a      Liverpool Playhouse and Nottingham Playhouse audience figures were over\u000a      15,000 for a production of Arturo Ui in which Kuhn was directly\u000a      involved, of which 1 in 10 tickets went to school groups from 48 schools.\u000a      All of these were widely reviewed in the national and regional press e.g.\u000a      the Liverpool Playhouse production was reviewed in The Times 06\/10\/11, The\u000a      Stage 5\/10\/11, The Guardian 7\/10\/1, The Observer 9\/10\/11, and The\u000a      Independent 10\/10\/11.[iv]\u000a    Informing improved performance and staging practices of Brecht's work\u000a    Kuhn's work on the texts `on performance' (esp. the Messingkauf)\u000a      is helping to inform new approaches to the training of actors and to\u000a      rehearsal work. His work on Brecht's visual imagination is suggesting new\u000a      ways of presenting the plays as not only dramatic but also visual\u000a      spectacles. In connection with his research on Brecht on Performance,\u000a      Kuhn collaborated with the director and theatre teacher Di Trevis in\u000a      holding a series of actors' workshops at the Giles Foreman Centre for\u000a      Acting, London in January 2013. A protocol of these and an essay on the\u000a      use of Brecht's theory in modern theatre practice were written and will\u000a      feature in the book, and a film will be appended (via weblink) to the\u000a      publication enabling others to replicate the workshops, training further\u000a      actors.[5]\u000a    Kuhn has often worked closely with translators (Constantine, Kushner,\u000a      Bremner), with theatres (recently especially the Young Vic and Liverpool\u000a      Playhouse) and with directors (Josh Machamer, Di Trevis, Walter\u000a      Meierjohann) in a form of national and international knowledge exchange.\u000a      He has often provided advice, historical and textual expertise, and\u000a      furnished programme notes and articles for theatres, lately for The Young\u000a      Vic (The Good Soul of Szechuan, May 2008) and for the Liverpool\u000a      Playhouse (Arturo Ui, October 2011).\u000a    Kuhn's work in Brecht studies is leading to a fuller understanding of\u000a      Brecht and is shaping the whole reception of this crucial poet, dramatist\u000a      and cultural commentator across the English-speaking world.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Kuhn's research has established him since the mid-1990s as one of the\u000a      world's leading experts on the modernist poet, playwright and cultural\u000a      commentator Bertolt Brecht. He has worked to increase the public\u000a      understanding of Brecht's work, to make good translations with reliable\u000a      commentaries widely available, and to enhance the quality of Brecht\u000a      theatre productions. Besides his involvement with (non-academic)\u000a      publishing, he has worked directly with theatres and drama colleges,\u000a      providing advice and workshops, revising translations, writing programme\u000a      notes, and improving the quality of performance of Brecht's work.\u000a      Beneficiaries include theatre audiences, school students, general readers,\u000a      the publishing industry, the performing arts, and cultural life in\u000a      general.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Oxford\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1880252","Name":"Singapore"},{"GeoNamesId":"1794299","Name":"Sichuan Sheng"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[1] `\"Ja, damals waren wir Dichter\".

His main research interests are in political\u000a      literature in the 20th century. Kuhn's long and intensive\u000a      involvement in Brecht research has won him the respect of the\u000a      international community of Brecht scholars &#8212; with whom he enjoys\u000a      productive networking relationships &#8212; and, crucially, also of the Brecht\u000a      heirs and publishers (Suhrkamp in Germany, Bloomsbury in the UK, and W.W.\u000a      Norton in the US).\u000a    Having started in the 1990s by examining the plays of Brecht's exile\u000a      period (1933 to 1947) and their political import, Kuhn has gone on to\u000a      research the young Brecht, Brecht's cultural and political theory, his\u000a      poetry, and the cultural transmission of his work. His early interest in\u000a      the plays has issued in important contributions on and editions of Die\u000a        Rundk&#246;pfe und die Spitzk&#246;pfe and Furcht und Elend des III.\u000a        Reiches (2001); the further research has generated articles, book\u000a      chapters and editions, besides the more ephemeral outputs (reviews,\u000a      theatre programmes, radio work).\u000a    Kuhn's particular contributions have included a new assessment of the\u000a      creative relationships around the young Brecht; in doing so has offered an\u000a      image of the origin of his multifaceted creativity and of a collective\u000a      approach to composition. This work has been widely referenced, above all\u000a      the article `Ja, damals waren wir Dichter'[1]. He has made\u000a      contributions to research into the reception and resonance of Brecht's\u000a      `anti-fascist' texts, to important synthetic accounts of Brecht's\u000a      theoretical writings (the book publication Brecht on Art and Politics\u000a      (2003)[2], which attempts a new narrative account of Brecht's\u000a      theoretical writings under these broad headings) and of his poetic output\u000a      (especially in Empedocles' Shoe and in the Brecht Handbuch,\u000a      to which Kuhn provided the introduction (both 2002)[3]).\u000a    More recently Kuhn has been working on Brecht's use of visual and\u000a      pictorial material[4]. As well as articles in the Brecht\u000a        Yearbook and elsewhere (2006-12), it is intended that this latest\u000a      work will issue in a book-length publication. Kuhn has been researching\u000a      Brecht's collective work practices in and around the theatre as well as\u000a      the relationship between his theoretical writings and work for the\u000a      theatre.[5][6] The work on Brecht on Art and Politics\u000a      is being developed in two further volumes of Brecht's theory (with Kuhn as\u000a      lead editor): a totally revised Brecht on Theatre and a new Brecht\u000a        on Performance (to be published in 2014).\u000a    A new project on translation and cultural transmission, funded by the\u000a      AHRC (see below), provides historical and critical reflection precisely on\u000a      issues of the mediation and `impact' of Brecht's work.

Academics professionally committed to\u000d\u000a      studying and disseminating a foreign literature also want to counter the\u000d\u000a      British reading public's notorious lack of interest in translations.\u000d\u000a      Readers demonstrate the accessibility of the editions through reviews e.g.\u000d\u000a      a review on Amazon of Robertson's Kafka: A Very Short Introduction\u000d\u000a      says: `this book does a fantastic job of introducing Kafka in a way which\u000d\u000a      is as useful to those familiar with his work as it is to new readers\u000d\u000a      [...]One of the most enjoyable aspects of the book is that it does not try\u000d\u000a      to teach you the 'meaning' of the novels, which is a flawed business where\u000d\u000a      Kafka is concerned and which would be impossible in such a short space of\u000d\u000a      time, but rather how to read them in a way that allows you to draw your\u000d\u000a      own conclusions.' (Zerbina, 11 December 2011).[i]\u000d\u000a    Within the OWC series the five Kafka volumes form a distinct subseries\u000d\u000a      (now available as a set)[ii]. The Kafka project provided an\u000d\u000a      opportunity to commission new translations of Kafka's main works from\u000d\u000a      outstanding translators including Anthea Bell, Joyce Crick, and Mike\u000d\u000a      Mitchell for a five-volume series, each with introduction and notes by\u000d\u000a      Robertson. This enabled Robertson to use his scholarly knowledge of Kafka,\u000d\u000a      his long experience of teaching Kafka to undergraduates and speaking on\u000d\u000a      Kafka to general audiences, and the practice in concentrating on\u000d\u000a      essentials gained from his well-received Kafka: A Very Short\u000d\u000a        Introduction (2004), by mediating these often opaque texts to a wide\u000d\u000a      readership without over-simplifying and without pressing any particular\u000d\u000a      line of interpretation on readers. The first three volumes were launched\u000d\u000a      by a public event hosted by the Bodleian Library, featuring a panel\u000d\u000a      discussion among the three translators, chaired by Professor Karen Leeder,\u000d\u000a      and talks by Mark Harman and Stanley Corngold (who have translated various\u000d\u000a      Kafka texts for American publishers), now available as a podcast. The\u000d\u000a      three volumes were also featured on the BBC Radio 4 Open Book programme\u000d\u000a      (with Mariella Frostrup and Lawrence Norfolk), broadcast on 12 July 2009\u000d\u000a      and repeated on 16 July [iii]. The remaining two volumes\u000d\u000a      appeared in 2012; Robertson presented them with a talk at the Oxford\u000d\u000a      Literary Festival on 29 March 2012 (audience c. 30) [iv]; one\u000d\u000a      attendee, a retired schoolteacher, wrote: `Robertson's lecture on The Man\u000d\u000a      who Disappeared at the Oxford Literary Festival not only inspired me to\u000d\u000a      read Kafka's first novel, but also sent me back to Kafka's masterpieces,\u000d\u000a      The Trial and The Castle.'\u000d\u000a    As OWC are published by OUP, their editor, who is based in Oxford, is\u000d\u000a      able to cultivate close links with Oxford academics. In the resulting\u000d\u000a      symbiosis, academics reach a wide readership; readers in turn benefit from\u000d\u000a      the introductions and notes which distinguish OWC from rival paperback\u000d\u000a      series. The editors, when not themselves working directly as translators,\u000d\u000a      work closely with translators: thus Cronk ensured that the translator of\u000d\u000a      Voltaire's Pocket Philosophical Dictionary, unlike all\u000d\u000a      predecessors, conveyed Voltaire's deliberately jarring use of low register\u000d\u000a      (which, after the Guardian printed an admiring review by Nicholas\u000d\u000a      Lezard, led to an exchange in its letter columns about the appropriateness\u000d\u000a      of using the word `shit' [v]).\u000d\u000a    Besides their own contributions, Cronk, Kahn and Robertson are often\u000d\u000a      asked to advise the publishers: `In my role as Senior Commissioning Editor\u000d\u000a      for the Oxford World's Classics series I solicit opinion from expert\u000d\u000a      scholarly advisers concerning the viability and quality of new proposals\u000d\u000a      for titles under consideration for publication in the series. For titles\u000d\u000a      in the field of modern European literature I consult with Ritchie\u000d\u000a      Robertson, Nicholas Cronk, and Andrew Kahn. They advise on the quality of\u000d\u000a      sample translation material, on the suitability and scope of editorial\u000d\u000a      material, on the prospects for new editions in the college market, and\u000d\u000a      they recommend possible translators and editors.' [1]This\u000a      collaboration leads also to expanding the classics base (e.g. by including\u000d\u000a      Jonathan Mallinson's translation of Graffigny's Letters from a\u000d\u000a        Peruvian) and to added value: e.g. Cronk's edition of Diderot's Rameau's\u000a        Nephew has as an appendix Goethe's essay on Diderot, never before\u000d\u000a      translated, and Kahn's version of Lermontov's Hero of our Time\u000d\u000a      (2013) also includes a new annotated translation of Pushkin's `Journey to\u000d\u000a      Erzerum'.\u000d\u000a    The academics' involvement helps to ensure and enhance the quality of\u000d\u000a      translated literature available not only in Britain but (since the series\u000d\u000a      sells widely overseas) to an international reading public. OWC has the\u000d\u000a      largest market share of any classics series after Penguin Classics. Sales\u000d\u000a      figures show that there is also a substantial demand worldwide among\u000d\u000a      general readers for reliable translations with informative introductory\u000d\u000a      material that enhances their reading experience and gives them background\u000d\u000a      knowledge. The OWC series is distributed worldwide via OUP's branch\u000d\u000a      network. Its sales form a significant part of the trade contribution to\u000d\u000a      the Academic Division's turnover. For the reporting period (Jan 2008 - Jul\u000d\u000a      2013) global sales for the volumes edited by Cronk, Kahn and Robertson (15\u000d\u000a      titles) total 84,028 with a further 23,891 in UK sales.[1]\u000d\u000a    OUP gains prestige from having a quality paperback series advertised in\u000d\u000a      both its academic and trade lists. Since the target readership includes\u000d\u000a      students, and the Commissioning Editor normally wants to be assured that a\u000d\u000a      text is widely read by undergraduates and\/or graduates, this is a further\u000d\u000a      reason for wishing to maximize the quality of the translations and\u000d\u000a      editorial matter; it is assumed, however, that the student readers are not\u000d\u000a      (mainly) modern languages students using cribs, but students on courses on\u000d\u000a      comparative and general literature, both here and (especially) in North\u000d\u000a      America. Cronk's edition of Voltaire's Letters concerning the English\u000d\u000a        Nation is used in French universities, including Rouen, Lyon II and\u000d\u000a      Paris IV (as the only edition of the English version of the Lettres\u000d\u000a        philosophiques authorized by Voltaire, it is crucial evidence of\u000d\u000a      Voltaire's European reputation and influence).[1]\u000d\u000a    During the impact period the above OWC titles were adopted for over 900\u000d\u000a      courses across more than 200 universities in the USA, taken by over 21,500\u000d\u000a      students; 394 of these courses were at private, 541 at public\u000d\u000a      institutions. In geographical range, the largest number was in the\u000d\u000a      Northwest (297), closely followed by the Midwest (285). The universities\u000d\u000a      with the most enrolments on courses using these texts were Michigan and\u000d\u000a      Berkeley with Ivy League universities such as Columbia, Harvard and Yale\u000d\u000a      also adopting the texts. Some 50% of the adoptions were of the\u000d\u000a        Interpretation of Dreams, The Metamorphosis, and the\u000d\u000a        Golden Pot. Besides the expected literature, language, history, and\u000d\u000a      general humanities \/ liberal arts programmes, some titles (Letters\u000d\u000a        Concerning the English Nation, Persian Letters, Rameau's Nephew, and\u000d\u000a      The Castle) also appear on political science and anthropology\u000d\u000a      syllabi. The Trial appears also on law and criminal justice\u000d\u000a      courses, while The Interpretation of Dreams is prescribed for\u000d\u000a      courses (both undergraduate and graduate) on history of science, law,\u000d\u000a      media studies, psychology, and music. The breadth and depth of adoption in\u000d\u000a      US higher education institutions clearly demonstrates the contribution\u000d\u000a      Cronk, Kahn and Robertson make to teaching via the supply of quality and\u000d\u000a      accessible translation of texts with wide interdisciplinary application.[1]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Oxford World's Classics (OWC), re-founded in 1980 as a paperback\u000d\u000a      series and now also available electronically, includes many new\u000d\u000a      translations from European languages with introduction and notes written\u000d\u000a      for a non-expert reader by scholars drawing on their academic research.\u000d\u000a      Three members of the Oxford Modern Languages Faculty (Cronk, Kahn,\u000d\u000a      Robertson) have been particularly active in translating and\/or editing\u000d\u000a      volumes and in advising the Series Commissioning Editor on the basis of\u000d\u000a      their respective research expertise. The impact is partly economic (sales,\u000d\u000a      including export sales), partly cultural in making key works of European\u000d\u000a      literature accessible to an Anglophone public reliant on translations and\u000d\u000a      partly educational as the editions are adopted worldwide on secondary\u000d\u000a      school, undergraduate and graduate reading lists.

His major scholarly\u000d\u000a      achievement is the study Pushkin's Lyric Intelligence (OUP, 2008;\u000d\u000a      now in paperback); he has also published a monograph on Pushkin's The\u000d\u000a        Bronze Horseman (1998), often cited as the standard work on its\u000d\u000a      subject, and edited the Cambridge Companion to Pushkin (2007).

Besides introducing OWC editions of\u000d\u000a      Pushkin and Lermontov, he has also shown his commitment to international\u000d\u000a      Enlightenment study by introducing Montesquieu's Persian Letters.\u000d\u000a    Professor Ritchie Robertson's research on Kafka long antedates\u000d\u000a      1993 but since then has led to many research articles and edited volumes.\u000d\u000a      His commitment both to advancing the understanding of Kafka and\u000d\u000a      communicating it to a wide public finds expression in his OWC\u000d\u000a      introductions and in his Kafka: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford:\u000d\u000a      OUP, 2004).

The\u000a      course was informed by questions central to the research project,\u000a      including how contemporary\u000a      visual art responds to international socio-political debates; how artists\u000a      address politics in their work;\u000a      and how contemporary visual art circulates inside and outside the\u000a      established art world.

Visitor\u000a      numbers were excellent, there was strong interaction and the feedback\u000a      suggested it was a\u000a      powerful, thought-provoking exhibition that had a profound effect on\u000a      attitudes and understanding\u000a      across different cultures' [source 4]. An Artistic Assessment commissioned\u000a      by Arts Council\u000a      England noted that `the exhibition as a whole has strong impact\u000a      communicating the overall aims of\u000a      the exhibition intelligently and thoughtfully', and that it was `very\u000a      timely in relation to the on-going\u000a      political events across many parts of North Africa' [source 5]. The\u000a      Cultural Counsellor at the French\u000a      Embassy in London described it as an `incredible exhibition which [....]\u000a      definitely contributed to a\u000a      better understanding between cultures by shedding light through the means\u000a      of contemporary art\u000a      upon less media-documented parts of decades of socio-political relations\u000a      between France, Algeria\u000a      and the UK' [source 6]. Other visitors at the preview evening commented:\u000a    \u000a       `The conceptualisation of it is brilliant and the diversity of the\u000a        work is extremely impressive.'\u000a       `It's the first time I've come up to the galleries at the\u000a        Cornerhouse. I thought it was very\u000a        interesting and I learnt new things about Algeria.'\u000a       `I really like the idea of transition and movement of people, it's a\u000a        really interesting thing to try to\u000a        map.

[source 7]\u000a    \u000a    According to the specialist magazine Art Monthly, `New\u000a        Cartographies maps out changes in the\u000a      cultural perception of boundaries inside and outside Algeria [...]\u000a      Indicative of a raised level of\u000a      consciousness across North Africa, ideas have been conceived with\u000a      political acumen in new media\u000a      formats yet the subject matter is expressed and espoused with considerable\u000a      feeling' [source 8].\u000a    The exhibition provided professional development opportunities for two\u000a      artists based in Algeria\u000a      (Amina Menia, Zineddine Bessa&#239;), who had little or no previous experience\u000a      of exhibiting outside\u000a      their own countries. Menia was interviewed on the BBC World Service\u000a      programme The Strand (first\u000a      broadcast 6 April 2011, estimated audience 40 million people worldwide),\u000a      along with Zineb Sedira,\u000a      whose installation was receiving its UK premiere at Cornerhouse. Two\u000a      artists sold work exhibited in\u000a      the show, and the work commissioned from Perivolaris led directly to\u000a      collaboration with the\u000a      American novelist Benjamin Buchholz on a photo-essay and related projects.\u000a      Perivolaris\u000a      commented that, `the commission provided me with an opportunity to broaden\u000a      my horizons as a\u000a      photographer by using my camera to seek insights into the people, politics\u000a      and culture of a country\u000a      which has experienced colonialism, repression and civil war' [source 9].\u000a      At 31 July 2013, the blog\u000a      produced by Perivolaris as part of his commission has attracted 19,058\u000a      views.\u000a    An unexpected political impact occurred when one of the Algerian artists\u000a      was refused a visa by the\u000a      UK Border Agency to attend the opening of the exhibition. His case became\u000a      part of a campaign to\u000a      ease visa restrictions on foreign artists visiting Britain, supported by\u000a      leading figures in the arts\u000a      world, including Antony Gormley. The issue was raised in the House of\u000a      Lords by the Earl of\u000a      Clancarty, and was the subject of a letter published in The Daily\u000a        Telegraph, supported by 100\u000a      signatories including the Cornerhouse team [source 10]. The immigration\u000a      minister Damien Green\u000a      announced in January 2012 that he would legislate in this area to allow\u000a      talented artists to enter the\u000a      UK more easily, although the matter was yet to be resolved.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at Durham University led to an exhibition of contemporary visual\u000a      art at Cornerhouse\u000a      Gallery (Manchester) from April to June 2011 exploring the relationship\u000a      between France and\u000a      Algeria.

The project ran\u000a      from September 2008 to\u000a      December 2011, and was carried out by Edward Welch (Senior\u000a      Lecturer in French at Durham\u000a      University, September 2001  &#8212;  August 2013) in collaboration with Joseph\u000a      McGonagle (University of\u000a      Manchester). The project emphasised the role of visual art in shaping\u000a      understanding of the\u000a      relationship between France and Algeria, which has been important\u000a      politically, socially and\u000a      culturally in both countries since the time of the Algerian War (1954-62)\u000a      and Algerian\u000a      independence (1962). It analysed a broad range of historical and\u000a      contemporary material, including\u000a      film, photography and visual print media. Pursuing an established\u000a      programme of research into\u000a      post-war French literature and culture, Welch contributed expertise on\u000a      research topics (the\u000a      representation of space; urban life and modernisation in post-war France;\u000a      the relationship between\u000a      photography and history); and on method (theoretical and critical\u000a      approaches to the photographic\u000a      image).\u000a    The project's findings were published in a co-authored book [output 1], a\u000a      position-piece article\u000a      [output 2] and a journal special issue [output 3]. Part 1 of the book\u000a      demonstrates how the visual\u000a      image, and photography especially, shaped narratives of French Algeria and\u000a      the Algerian War at\u000a      the time and subsequently. It explores how photographs have been mobilised\u000a      by different groups,\u000a      such as expatriated European settler communities, French conscript\u000a      soldiers, and Algerian victims\u000a      of police repression in France, to assert or challenge certain\u000a      understandings of France's Algerian\u000a      history. For example, it shows how the production and circulation of\u000a      photo-books by expatriated\u000a      European settler communities (pieds-noirs) sustain and enable a\u000a      nostalgic vision of colonial French\u000a      Algeria through two visual strategies in particular: on the one hand,\u000a      depictions of colonial\u000a      cityscapes at the height of the French Empire in the 1930s; on the other,\u000a      images of urban\u000a      environments modernised in the post-war period as France embarked on a\u000a      last-ditch attempt to\u000a      maintain power in Algeria. These visual traces of France's lost empire\u000a      persist as a marginal, yet\u000a      nevertheless disruptive, presence in the contemporary French public\u000a      sphere.\u000a    Part 2 examines how the post-colonial relationship between France and\u000a      Algeria as independent,\u000a      sovereign states has been depicted in film and photography. It emphasises\u000a      the key theatres and\u000a      spaces in which the contemporary Franco-Algerian relationship is staged,\u000a      from the deprived\u000a      suburbs (banlieues) of France's major cities, to the Algerian bled\u000a      (ancestral village) idealised as\u000a      home by Algerians in France. It draws attention as well to the dual values\u000a      carried by the\u000a      Mediterranean Sea, as barrier and frontier on the one hand, and hyphen or\u000a      point of crossing on the\u000a      other. In doing so, it shows how the Franco-Algerian relationship\u000a      exemplifies broader issues in\u000a      contemporary geopolitics, including global economic flows, population\u000a      movements and\u000a      configurations of national identity.\u000a    The project's findings informed the intellectual agenda and content of\u000a      the Cornerhouse exhibition\u000a      through the selection of artists, and the organisation and grouping of\u000a      their work on themed floors.\u000a      The aim of the exhibition was to explore how contemporary visual art from\u000a      the two countries\u000a      articulates the relationship between them and their shared history, and to\u000a      do so for a non-specialist,\u000a\u0009  UK-based audience for the most part unfamiliar with the\u000a      historical significance and\u000a      contemporary relevance of the Franco-Algerian relationship.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11820","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3932488","Name":"Peru"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3625428","Name":"Venezuela"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3658394","Name":"Ecuador"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Through their research on Pons and Varda respectively, Fouz Hern&#225;ndez and\u000d\u000a      Barnet established personal contacts which led to each filmmaker's\u000d\u000a      engagement with, and participation in, events aimed at increasing\u000d\u000a      understanding of their work among the general public. The events were\u000d\u000a      organised in partnership with the Gala Theatre in Durham and the Tyneside\u000d\u000a      Cinema in Newcastle and thereby helped them to fulfil their objectives of\u000d\u000a      contributing to the cultural enrichment of North East England. Pons and\u000d\u000a      Varda are major figures in European art house cinema. Pons is one of the\u000d\u000a      best-known filmmakers in contemporary Spanish and Catalan cinema, having\u000d\u000a      made 24 films in the course of a 30-year career. His films have been\u000d\u000a      credited as establishing a Catalan `star system'. Varda's contribution to\u000d\u000a      film has been recognised over several decades, including a lifetime\u000d\u000a      achievement award at the Cannes Film Festival (2010).\u000d\u000a    In 2009, Fouz Hern&#225;ndez invited Pons to give a public lecture at Durham\u000d\u000a      University, and to take part in the UK premiere of his film, Barcelona\u000d\u000a        (un mapa) (2007), at the city's Gala Theatre, an institution funded\u000d\u000a      by Durham County Council. The events took place on 25 January 2010, with\u000d\u000a      support from the Catalan cultural organization, the Institut Ram&#243;n Llull.\u000d\u000a      Fouz Hern&#225;ndez's research on Pons had come to the filmmaker's attention in\u000d\u000a      2007, thanks to his co-authored book, Live Flesh (2007). Films by\u000d\u000a      Pons had previously been shown at the (now-defunct) Newcastle Film\u000d\u000a      Festival, and Pons was keen to show another film in the North East. Fouz\u000d\u000a      Hern&#225;ndez selected Barcelona (un mapa) because it emphasised key\u000d\u000a      aspects of Pons' cinema, and in particular, the issues of male nudity,\u000d\u000a      homosexuality and identity that Fouz Hern&#225;ndez has stressed as central to\u000d\u000a      his work. Pons' public lecture at Durham University (attended by over 100\u000d\u000a      people) was followed by a question and answer session chaired by Fouz\u000d\u000a      Hern&#225;ndez, and a sold-out screening of the film at the Gala Theatre. Pons\u000d\u000a      commented that `the screening and talk at Durham strengthened my links to\u000d\u000a      the UK film circuit, having presented some of my other films at festivals\u000d\u000a      in Manchester, Cambridge and, especially, London, for the last three\u000d\u000a      decades. [...] Events such as this can have a considerable impact on\u000d\u000a      foreign distribution of my films in various formats and, importantly, on\u000d\u000a      the spread of Catalan culture abroad' [source 1]. Although the Gala\u000d\u000a      Theatre generally screens mainstream films, it does aim to `show films\u000d\u000a      from around the globe, particularly from independent film makers, and to\u000d\u000a      bring their work to wider attention'. The screening of Pons' film\u000d\u000a      contributed to the Gala meeting this objective. The then-Director of the\u000d\u000a      Gala Theatre states that staging the UK premier of Pons' film `was\u000d\u000a      enormously successful', and gave `a tremendous boost to our programme and\u000d\u000a      [helped] to establish our venue in the region as a key World Cinema\u000d\u000a      location' [source 2].\u000d\u000a    The Tyneside Cinema is an independent organisation and registered\u000d\u000a      educational charity located in central Newcastle, screening foreign\u000d\u000a      language and independent films from around the world. According to the\u000d\u000a      cinema's Programme Manager, its aim is to play `a significant role in the\u000d\u000a      cultural life of the North East', and to do so by bringing `as many people\u000d\u000a      as possible together in our venue to experience, enjoy and engage with the\u000d\u000a      past, present and future of cinema'. During 2011, Barnet collaborated with\u000d\u000a      the Tyneside Cinema on a festival to mark the fiftieth anniversary of\u000d\u000a      Agn&#232;s Varda's most celebrated film, Cl&#233;o de 5 &#224; 7 (1962). Held\u000d\u000a      from 10 to 24 November 2012, the festival included a retrospective of five\u000d\u000a      Varda films; in addition to Cl&#233;o de 5 &#224; 7, Barnet selected four\u000d\u000a      films to demonstrate the diversity of Varda's cinematic output over the\u000d\u000a      course of five decades. The selection served to emphasise the key thematic\u000d\u000a      concerns that Barnet's research has shown to be central to Varda's work.\u000d\u000a      For example, both Sans toit ni loi (1985) and Les Glaneurs et\u000d\u000a        la glaneuse (2000) depict the nature and condition of marginality in\u000d\u000a      contemporary society, while Les Plages d'Agn&#232;s (2008) foregrounds\u000d\u000a      Varda's investigation of space, and its relationship to mourning, memory\u000d\u000a      and identity. Barnet co-authored the press release and the relevant\u000d\u000a      section of the Tyneside programme. The festival included an academic\u000d\u000a      conference on Varda, featuring nine speakers from six universities in the\u000d\u000a      UK and Canada, and open to the general public. The conference examined\u000d\u000a      Varda's artistic production across five decades, and her manipulation of a\u000d\u000a      range of genres and styles, from photography and film to hybrid\u000d\u000a      documentary and installation art. The festival closed with a sold-out\u000d\u000a      evening showing of a restored print of Cl&#233;o de 5 &#224; 7, with Varda\u000d\u000a      herself present. The screening was followed by a question and answer\u000d\u000a      session with the cinema audience and Varda, chaired by Barnet. The films\u000d\u000a      generated box office takings of &#163;1,433 (gross) for the cinema [source 3].\u000d\u000a    Varda's attendance at the festival was the director's only public\u000d\u000a      engagement in the UK to mark the anniversary of Cl&#233;o de 5 &#224; 7, and\u000d\u000a      was secured thanks to the relationship developed between Barnet and Varda\u000d\u000a      since 2006. The Varda festival, and the filmmaker's participation, helped\u000d\u000a      the Tyneside achieve its own objectives as an arts organisation. The\u000d\u000a      Programme Manager highlighted Varda's participation at the festival as\u000d\u000a      essential to its success: `To get someone like Varda to come and talk\u000d\u000a      about their work is the kind of thing you usually only get in London at\u000d\u000a      the BFI. It was a real coup for us. It was about having someone of that\u000d\u000a      stature coming here'. Varda's presence raised the cinema's profile in the\u000d\u000a      North East, with coverage in regional media (Sky Tyne and Wear and The\u000d\u000a        Journal). The Programme Manager concluded that `the opportunity to\u000d\u000a      bring a filmmaker of the stature of Agn&#232;s Varda to the Tyneside was a real\u000d\u000a      gift to the Cinema and its audiences' [source 4].\u000d\u000a    In 2011, Noble was invited by the Director General of the Guadalajara\u000d\u000a      International Film Festival (FICG) to serve on the panel for `Best\u000d\u000a      Ibero-American film' in its 2012 edition. The FICG is the most important\u000d\u000a      film festival in Latin America, awarding approximately &#163;240,000 in prize\u000d\u000a      money. 260 films from 45 countries were shown in the 2012 edition, which\u000d\u000a      registered a record of over 100,000 paid admissions. The winner of the\u000d\u000a      `Best Ibero-American film' category automatically enters the selection\u000d\u000a      stage of the Golden Globes organised by the Hollywood Foreign Press\u000d\u000a      Association [source 5]. Noble's selection by the Director General was\u000d\u000a      based on her track record of expertise in the cultural history of Mexican\u000d\u000a      and Latin American film acknowledged by film historians and professionals\u000d\u000a      in Mexico over the course of the previous years. Her work had come to the\u000d\u000a      Director General's attention during her research visits in 2000 and 2001\u000d\u000a      to the Filmoteca de la Universidad Nacional Aut&#243;noma de M&#233;xico, the most\u000d\u000a      important film archive in Mexico, which he ran between 1989 and 2008. The\u000d\u000a      Director General states that, `during these visits, she told me about the\u000d\u000a      objectives and focus of her work; [...] but also several academics and\u000d\u000a      cinephiles from our country and abroad told me about the importance of her\u000d\u000a      work' [source 6]. The importance of Noble's research was also acknowledged\u000d\u000a      by the Mexican cultural attach&#233; in the UK, who had been director of the\u000d\u000a      main government-funded body for promoting and financing national cinema in\u000d\u000a      Mexico, the Instituto Mexicano de Cinematograf&#237;a. In 2007, the cultural\u000d\u000a      attach&#233; and the Mexican Embassy funded a visit to Durham by the future\u000d\u000a      director of the FICG to take part in a workshop on Mexican science fiction\u000d\u000a      films with Noble.\u000d\u000a    Noble was the sole academic jury member in the 2012 edition. Her panel\u000d\u000a      was otherwise made up of film industry professionals, including the editor\u000d\u000a      of a leading Spanish-language film magazine; an international film\u000d\u000a      festival organiser; a Mexican film director; and a Mexican film actress\u000d\u000a      [source 7]. According to the Director General, Noble's contribution as a\u000d\u000a      jury member lay in insights based on her historical understanding of key\u000d\u000a      themes and trends in Mexican and Latin American cinema: `an academic\u000d\u000a      perspective is always important because it is based on a wide historical\u000d\u000a      context that can be shared with other members of the jury who are perhaps\u000d\u000a      focussed on purely technical and contextual questions. This is precisely\u000d\u000a      what happened through Noble's participation, which brought historical\u000d\u000a      antecedents that helped to understand the provenance of certain themes'\u000d\u000a      [source 6]. Recognising Noble's successful participation in the 2012\u000d\u000a      festival, and the contribution of her historical expertise, the organising\u000d\u000a      committee included a greater number of academics on juries for the 2013\u000d\u000a      festival (three in total): `having Noble on the jury has reinforced this\u000d\u000a      position, and in the last edition of the festival, we included a greater\u000d\u000a      quantity of academics' [source 6].\u000d\u000a    The jury on which Noble served was one of eight panels in the festival.\u000d\u000a      Its remit was to award prizes for new cinematic production from across the\u000d\u000a      Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world. It considered sixteen pre-selected\u000d\u000a      films from nine countries (Argentina, Bolivia Brazil, Chile, Colombia,\u000d\u000a      Ecuador Peru, Spain, Venezuela). The panel awarded prize money totalling\u000d\u000a      $400,000MXN (&#163;19,000), and trophies in the following categories: Best\u000d\u000a      Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best First\u000d\u000a      Film, Best Director and Best Ibero-American Feature. Success in the\u000d\u000a      competition represented a significant increase in profile for the winning\u000d\u000a      films, with concomitant benefits in terms of local and international sales\u000d\u000a      and distribution. The award of Best Director and Best Actor to Ecuadorian\u000d\u000a      film Pescador came shortly before the film's commercial release in\u000d\u000a      its home market. According to the film's producers, it helped them promote\u000d\u000a      the film and generate public interest there [source 8]. The distributor of\u000d\u000a      Abrir Puertas y Ventanas [Back to Stay] states that the award of\u000d\u000a      Best Film `was a catalyst in terms of sales' as a result of increased\u000d\u000a      media exposure: for example, shortly after the award of the prize, the\u000d\u000a      film secured national distribution in its home country of Argentina\u000d\u000a      [source 9].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research on world cinema at Durham University has led to collaboration\u000d\u000a      with filmmakers, cinemas and film festivals regionally and\u000d\u000a      internationally.

In doing so, they have helped those organisations to meet their\u000d\u000a      own institutional objectives.

The research that\u000d\u000a      underpins the activities presented here is attentive to gender's\u000d\u000a      political, aesthetic and historical dimensions within visual culture.\u000d\u000a    Collaborations by Marie-Claire Barnet and Santiago Fouz\u000d\u000a        Hern&#225;ndez with contemporary international filmmakers result from\u000d\u000a      their research into European cinema and visual culture. Fouz Hern&#225;ndez (in\u000d\u000a      post at Durham since 1999) has worked on Ventura Pons's cinema of as part\u000d\u000a      of his investigation into contemporary Spanish cinema, and in particular,\u000d\u000a      representations of masculinity and the male body. He has shown how Pons'\u000d\u000a      films of the late 1970s and early 1980s break contemporary taboos in their\u000d\u000a      depiction of non-normative masculinities, and how Pons' cinema goes beyond\u000d\u000a      the gaze to engage other senses of the spectator [output 4]. He has\u000d\u000a      demonstrated how these concerns are related more broadly to the period of\u000d\u000a      the Spanish transition to democracy (1975-1982), and to contemporary\u000d\u000a      Catalan culture and national identity [outputs 3 and 5]. Barnet (in post\u000d\u000a      at Durham since 1997) researches contemporary French literary and visual\u000d\u000a      culture, focusing on female writers and filmmakers. She has investigated\u000d\u000a      Agn&#232;s Varda's use of cinematic and photographic space, and the\u000d\u000a      continuities between her films and her increasing use of mixed-media\u000d\u000a      forms [outputs 1 and 2]. In October 2006, Barnet and Shirley Jordan (Queen\u000d\u000a      Mary, University of London) interviewed Varda together [output 1].\u000d\u000a      Barnet's questions emphasised issues of space, gender and autobiography.\u000d\u000a      They led Varda to elucidate her conceptual concerns, including the\u000d\u000a      interplay between material and psychic spaces, and the resonance of\u000d\u000a      certain geographic locations. In particular, Varda set out the importance\u000d\u000a      that beaches hold for her as spaces of mourning, memory and indeterminacy.\u000d\u000a      Barnet pursues these themes in her reading of Varda's 2006 exhibition, L'&#206;le\u000a        et Elle [output 2]. She shows how Varda's experimental artistic\u000d\u000a      practice extends beyond celluloid and the conventional museum space, into\u000d\u000a      site-specific installations of both private and public spaces.\u000d\u000a    Andrea Noble's work as a jury member at the 2012 Guadalajara\u000d\u000a      International Film Festival arose out of her research on Latin American\u000d\u000a      visual culture, and in particular her 2005 book, Mexican National\u000d\u000a        Cinema [output 6]. Noble has been in post at Durham since 1998. Her\u000d\u000a      book takes a cultural historical and thematic approach to Mexican cinema,\u000d\u000a      from its inception in 1896 through to more recent productions. It examines\u000d\u000a      clusters of films produced at different moments in the history of Mexican\u000d\u000a      cinema, demonstrating how they register changes and patterns in Mexican\u000d\u000a      and Latin American cultural history and identity. In doing so, her book\u000d\u000a      maps the connection between cinema and modernity, where cinema is\u000d\u000a      understood as a key emblem and crucible of modernity and the processes of\u000d\u000a      modernisation. For example, it analyses the relationship between the 1910\u000d\u000a      Mexican Revolution as a historical event, and film as a receptacle for and\u000d\u000a      catalyst of memory of the Revolution. Crucially, it draws out the role\u000d\u000a      played by film melodrama in articulating changing conceptions of\u000d\u000a      masculinity; and it stresses the cinematic representation of the\u000d\u000a      indigenous Other in relationship to the development of patterns in\u000d\u000a      anthropological discourses. Its analysis is underpinned by an\u000d\u000a      understanding of Mexican cultural and cinematic history in relation to\u000d\u000a      Hollywood on the one hand, and developments in Latin American cinema on\u000d\u000a      the other. Methodologically, the book engages with film theory that has\u000d\u000a      emerged largely in the Euro-American academy, while seeking to question\u000d\u000a      and nuance this by bringing to bear insights from Latin American cultural\u000d\u000a      theory and history.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11821","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In July 2011, as a result of his established reputation in the history of\u000d\u000a      Russian child science, Byford was invited by the Department of Educational\u000d\u000a      Psychology at Moscow Pedagogical State University (MPGU) in July 2011 to\u000d\u000a      act as an expert consultant on the history of child science [source 1]. He\u000d\u000a      undertook two periods of consultancy, in March-April 2012 (part-funded by\u000d\u000a      the British Academy) and in March-April 2013 (funded as part of an AHRC\u000d\u000a      Early Career Fellowship).

The Department of Educational\u000d\u000a      Psychology was created in 2010 with the explicit aim of developing new\u000d\u000a      approaches to the psychology of education, in part by drawing on a wider\u000d\u000a      than usual range of resources from representatives of different\u000d\u000a      disciplines, and more especially, international academics, whose work has\u000d\u000a      the potential to innovate contemporary educational theory and practice.\u000d\u000a      Its ten researchers and lecturers train postgraduate students studying\u000d\u000a      towards qualifications in the `Psychology of Educational Management' and\u000d\u000a      the `Practical Psychology of Education'. As a research group they occupy a\u000d\u000a      strategic position in the field of educational-psychological expertise in\u000d\u000a      the Russian Federation, analogous to that occupied by early-Soviet `child\u000d\u000a      scientists'. They provide regular advisory services to over one hundred\u000d\u000a      educational establishments in Moscow, working with both schools and\u000d\u000a      children's homes. They provide training to teachers and parent groups.\u000d\u000a      They organise special, psychologically informed, learning and teaching\u000d\u000a      workshops and events directly with pupils. The Department invited Byford\u000d\u000a      as it believed that an understanding of the historical legacies of Russian\u000d\u000a      child science would assist its contribution to contemporary processes in\u000d\u000a      Russian education, and inform its collective work as researchers and\u000d\u000a      experts in this field.\u000d\u000a    During his first visit in 2012, Byford took part in staff meetings and a\u000d\u000a      number of outreach activities [source 4]. His consultations took the form\u000d\u000a      of a seminar on child science as a multi-professional field, followed by a\u000d\u000a      discussion with the Department's staff and postgraduates, and with staff\u000d\u000a      of the Russian Academy of Education [source 2]. Byford gave an\u000d\u000a      introductory lecture on this topic to over 50 trainee primary school\u000d\u000a      teachers studying at MPGU [source 3]. In the words of the Department's\u000d\u000a      Head, `the social-historical studies of Andy Byford allow[ed] us to\u000d\u000a      understand the causes and risks of educational reforms currently taking\u000d\u000a      place in Russia, including such areas as inclusive education, the\u000d\u000a      professionalisation of teachers, and the disciplinary fragmentation of\u000d\u000a      specialists in this field'. Noting that the issues raised by Byford are\u000d\u000a      rarely considered in modern Russia, the Department's Head concluded that\u000d\u000a      his contributions `proved to be much needed in contemporary\u000d\u000a      psychological-pedagogical research as well as educational practice in\u000d\u000a      Russia'. He emphasised the significance of Byford's research `for the\u000d\u000a      appropriate development [in Russia] of interdisciplinary research in\u000d\u000a      childhood and contemporary educational practice' [source 4].\u000d\u000a    A second round of consultations took place in March-April 2013. These\u000d\u000a      involved (a) a series of three seminars for twenty postgraduates; (b) two\u000d\u000a      focus-groups, one with the department's staff and participants in its\u000d\u000a      postgraduate professional training programme, and the other with their\u000d\u000a      wider network of contacts and beneficiaries in the Russian education field\u000d\u000a      (fourteen participants in total); and (c) a public lecture on the\u000d\u000a      `afterlife' of Russian child science [source 5]. The lecture was attended\u000d\u000a      by over fifty lecturers, PhD, Masters and undergraduate students based at\u000d\u000a      MPGU's Faculty of Pedagogy and Psychology, as well as by representatives\u000d\u000a      of other Moscow-based universities and research institutes. It also\u000d\u000a      attracted the attention of representatives of `Researcher', the\u000d\u000a      all-Russian movement of creative educators, as well as teachers and\u000d\u000a      psychologists from leading Moscow schools [source 7]. The lecture was\u000d\u000a      published in expanded form in Prepodavatel': XXI vek [The Teacher:\u000d\u000a      21st Century], a professional academic journal widely read by Russian\u000d\u000a      teachers, educational psychologists and related professionals. All these\u000d\u000a      activities were documented and publicised on Byford's Durham-based project\u000d\u000a      website (in English and Russian; 2,119 visitors by 31 July 2013) and on\u000d\u000a      the MPGU website (in Russian; 281 visitors to the 2013 seminars pages by\u000d\u000a      31 July 2013), as well as through social media, including Twitter (28\u000d\u000a      followers) and Youtube (94 views for the public lecture) [source 9].\u000d\u000a    As noted by the Head of MPGU's Department of Educational Psychology, the\u000d\u000a      issues raised in the focus groups and seminars allowed the group `to\u000d\u000a      define [their] approach to topical psychological and pedagogical problems,\u000d\u000a      to conceptualise the underlying logic of this approach and to support this\u000d\u000a      with arguments'. He also stated that `the knowledge of the mechanisms of\u000d\u000a      paedology's evolution as a scientific movement enables an appropriate\u000d\u000a      interpretation of contemporary processes and grounds our prognoses of how\u000d\u000a      pedagogy and psychology will develop in the future' [source 7]. Byford's\u000d\u000a      research insights affected the group's perception of their existing work\u000d\u000a      and professional role as part of a wider social enterprise. One\u000d\u000a      participant found it particularly useful to understand `the complexity\u000d\u000a      [and] importance, of forging multi-professional relations and relations\u000d\u000a      between specialists and parents'. Another noted that the discussions\u000d\u000a      `enhanced [their] sense of responsibility'. A third remarked that `the\u000d\u000a      path of developing influence [became] clearer &#8212; what [was] possible and\u000d\u000a      what the difficulties might be'; others, who initially `thought that\u000d\u000a      [their] influence was minimal &#8212; now [saw] various possibilities opening\u000d\u000a      up' [source 6]. The group was particularly `impressed by the depth and\u000d\u000a      thoroughness' [source 7] of the discussions concerning Russia's historical\u000d\u000a      experience of mobilising parent groups in the work of professionals in\u000d\u000a      education, psychology and child welfare, and the challenges posed by\u000d\u000a      diverse forms of partnerships that parents and professionals are able to\u000d\u000a      form in matters of childcare, education and research, which go well beyond\u000d\u000a      a fixed expert-client relationship. A postgraduate trainee in psychology,\u000d\u000a      who works in preschool education, stated that this topic `made [her]\u000d\u000a      rethink aspects of [her] practical work' [source 6].\u000d\u000a    Participants emphasised the relevance of Byford's approach to early\u000d\u000a      twentieth-century traditions of Russian\/Soviet child science for\u000d\u000a      contemporary educational and child welfare reforms in the Russian\u000d\u000a      Federation. The Head of Department pointed out that before Byford's\u000d\u000a      consultations `the history of paedology remained mostly outside [his\u000d\u000a      Department's] purview [...]. Many [of their] PhD candidates and Masters\u000d\u000a      students thus [thanks to Byford's seminars] for the first time turned\u000d\u000a      their attention to the legacy of paedology'. As a result of this second\u000d\u000a      period of consultancy, the Department took the decision to revise, with\u000d\u000a      immediate effect, their courses in the `Psychology of Education' and\u000d\u000a      `History of the Theory of Educational Psychology' for undergraduate and\u000d\u000a      Master's students, incorporating the use of research articles by Byford,\u000d\u000a      and other materials produced by him during the two periods of consultancy\u000d\u000a      [source 7]. Podcasts of Byford's lectures and seminars, together with\u000d\u000a      associated material, remain in place as a teaching resource on MPGU's\u000d\u000a      website [source 9]. In the June 2013 examination session, assessment on\u000d\u000a      the Department's Masters programme included questions on topics covered in\u000d\u000a      Byford's lectures and seminars [source 7].\u000d\u000a    In April 2013, at the end of the second period of consultancy, following\u000d\u000a      suggestions by staff and students at MPGU, Byford was invited by the Head\u000d\u000a      of Department to join a team of authors to prepare a new undergraduate\u000d\u000a      textbook for educational psychologists (Introduction to a Profession:\u000d\u000a        The Educational Psychologist [in Russian]) as the author responsible\u000d\u000a      for the textbook's historical section (two and a half chapters, amounting\u000d\u000a      to 20% of the textbook). Byford adapted his research publications for this\u000d\u000a      purpose, with particular focus on the historical relationship between\u000d\u000a      education and psychology. The textbook is scheduled for publication in\u000d\u000a      early 2014 in 1,500 copies in its first edition. It will be marketed to\u000d\u000a      undergraduates training as educational psychologists and related\u000d\u000a      professionals across the Russian Federation. Its Russian publisher Iurait\u000d\u000a      is a well-established producer of high-quality academic textbooks,\u000d\u000a      specialising in professional training [source 8].

Supported by grants from the British Academy and the AHRC,\u000d\u000a      awarded in 2011, his research examines the social, cultural and political\u000d\u000a      contingencies in the rise and fall of scientific movements, professional\u000d\u000a      frameworks and expert discourses in Russian education, psychology and\u000d\u000a      child welfare. It shows that early twentieth-century child science\u000d\u000a      developed as a heterogeneous field of scientific and professional work,\u000d\u000a      carried out through interactions between experts belonging to different\u000d\u000a      institutional and professional structures and environments [output 2]. It\u000d\u000a      demonstrates that Russian child science was a `scientific-professional\u000d\u000a      movement' akin to a `social movement', that is to say a relatively\u000d\u000a      temporary form of mobilisation and collective action for a particular\u000d\u000a      purpose [output 3]. It explains that this movement was vital to\u000d\u000a      professional and disciplinary formation in areas such as educational\u000d\u000a      psychology and special education [outputs 2 and 3]. It ties these\u000d\u000a      processes to certain broader types of anthropology of childhood, social\u000d\u000a      reproduction and social transformation [output 1]. Byford's research also\u000d\u000a      places the development of the Russian child science movement in the wider\u000d\u000a      social and cultural history of childhood in Russia [output 4].\u000d\u000a    Russian child science emerged around 1900 as a controversial area of\u000d\u000a      expertise, bringing together different professions and disciplines which\u000d\u000a      treated child development and socialisation as a territory of specialist\u000d\u000a      investigation. In the 1930s, Soviet paedology was eliminated by Stalin on\u000d\u000a      political grounds, leading to the dismantlement of its institutions, the\u000d\u000a      purging of its specialists, and a ban on its methodologies (e.g. mental\u000d\u000a      testing). After the Soviet Union's collapse, the ban was lifted, and since\u000d\u000a      the 1990s, the history of Russian child science has come to be regarded as\u000d\u000a      directly relevant to contemporary transformations of educational and\u000d\u000a      children's services in the Russian Federation. This professional field\u000d\u000a      faces significant dilemmas about how to approach a number of key issues:\u000d\u000a      the professional role of school psychologists, inclusive vs. special\u000d\u000a      education, class streaming, intelligence and ability testing, teacher\u000d\u000a      authority and classroom discipline, the use of technology in the\u000d\u000a      classroom, traditional vs. free-educational models, the development of\u000d\u000a      experimental innovation in pedagogy, relations between parents and\u000d\u000a      professionals. Professionals in the field have asked themselves whether\u000d\u000a      these problems might be resolved through the revival of certain early\u000d\u000a      twentieth-century Russian traditions of child science, as a uniquely\u000d\u000a      `holistic' approach to addressing the issues of child development and\u000d\u000a      socialisation [output 3].\u000d\u000a    Byford's research draws out the historical underpinnings of these issues,\u000d\u000a      and their relevance for contemporary professional and scientific expertise\u000d\u000a      on the development of children. It has revealed the means by which\u000d\u000a      different stakeholders are brought into child science [output 1]. It has\u000d\u000a      explained how different professions collaborate and what the main\u000d\u000a      obstacles to this might be [output 2]. It has analysed how experts\u000d\u000a      interact with the wider public, especially parents [outputs 1 and 2]. It\u000d\u000a      has charted transformations in the working relationships between experts,\u000d\u000a      on the one hand, and political and administrative structures, on the other\u000d\u000a      [output 3].

It therefore\u000a      has special responsibilities both to provide leadership for professional\u000a      translators, and to help them meet the challenges posed by the\u000a      increasingly multilingual environment in the European Union. The DGT has\u000a      established the European Masters in Translation (EMT), the main goal of\u000a      which is `to improve the quality of translator training and to get highly\u000a      skilled people to work as translators in the EU'. In order to achieve this\u000a      objective, the EMT has defined and implemented a `quality label for\u000a      university translation programmes that meet agreed professional standards\u000a      and market demands'. The EMT reports that `more and more universities use\u000a      it as a model for designing their programmes' [source 1].\u000a    Before the EMT was launched in 2006, no recognised means existed by which\u000a      to evaluate and compare Masters translation programmes across the European\u000a      Union. The EMT aims to enhance translation programmes in general by\u000a      establishing an accredited benchmark that will ensure that translators\u000a      develop the competencies needed `to keep up with the requirements of a\u000a      knowledge society' [source 2]. From 2006 to 2008, an EMT Expert Group\u000a      drafted benchmarking documents in preparation for the creation of a\u000a      European network of Masters translation programmes. The documents define\u000a      the admission requirements for universities seeking membership of the EMT\u000a      network, and a `translator competence profile', which details the\u000a      competences translators need to work successfully in today's market'\u000a      [source 1].\u000a    These preparations led in 2009 to the first call for applications for\u000a      membership of the EMT Network of Excellence. The EMT has since granted\u000a      official accreditation to 54 programmes out of 355 applications to join\u000a      the network. It has thereby established common requirements for curricula\u000a      in translation studies. The two key achievements of the EMT have been: (i)\u000a      to re-define translator skills and the learning objectives of MA\u000a      programmes in translation, and (ii) to guarantee quality assurance in\u000a      translator training programmes.\u000a    Federici became involved in the EMT following two conferences in 2007,\u000a      attended by delegates from its Expert Group and by DGT representatives,\u000a      and at which he presented his research on the dangers of culturally\u000a      uninformed translation and the need for translators to develop continuous\u000a      learning practices (papers which respectively became outputs 1 and 3). As\u000a      a result of these presentations, in 2009 the DGT invited Federici to join\u000a      the EMT Evaluation Group, charged with assessing applications and\u000a      accrediting programmes across the EU.As a member of the Evaluation Group,\u000a      Federici contributed to the development of EMT policy in relation to\u000a      translator training, as articulated in key policy documents published in\u000a      2012 [source 2] and 2013 [source 3].\u000a    In June 2011 Federici was one of three new members co-opted to the EMT\u000a      Board, which comprises ten academic experts from Belgium, Finland, France,\u000a      Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and the UK [source\u000a      4] and in the following year, the Board was given the task of drafting a\u000a      new EMT strategy document. With two existing Board members, Federici led\u000a      Working Group 1 on `Training and trainers' which defined the competencies\u000a      that translator trainers should possess or acquire throughout their career\u000a      [source 5]. The findings of this Working Group informed the 2012 EMT\u000a      Strategy, co-written by Federici and the other members of the Board. Its\u000a      first objective makes evident Federici's direct contribution: to `foster\u000a      and encourage dynamic learning and teaching of advanced translation skills\u000a      with a view to preparing students for continuous learning and a life-long\u000a      career as translators' [source 2].\u000a    As the document underpinning the EMT Charter, the EMT Strategy has\u000a      policy-making implications. The EMT Network members sign up to the values\u000a      of the Charter, which has legal status as it grants the use of the EMT\u000a      `quality label' and guarantees that the Masters programme fulfil the\u000a      standard expected by the DGT. The DGT and the EMT Board have signed\u000a      agreements with the Globalization and Localization Association (GALA) on\u000a      24 May 2012 [source 6], and with the European Language Industry\u000a      Association (ELIA) on 16 November 21012 [source 7]. The influence of\u000a      Federici's research has therefore been significant and far-reaching:\u000a      changes to the definition of skills, membership requirements, and\u000a      curricula design benefit the 54 EU member programmes, which enrol between\u000a      1,500 and 1,800 MA students every year.\u000a    The Director General of the DGT remarks upon Federici's `great expertise\u000a      [...] in the field of higher education translator training', and notes the\u000a      important role played by his research on assessment and revision of\u000a      translations in discussions at Board meetings [source 8].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The European Masters in Translation (EMT) is a partnership between the\u000a      European Commission and higher education (HE) institutions in 27 member\u000a      states that offer master's level translation studies programmes.

His research addresses the problem that cross-cultural\u000a      translations can often give rise to misrepresentations in the translated\u000a      text. Low-quality translation in public discourse - in newspapers, policy\u000a      statements, and cultural and commercial materials - is particularly\u000a      susceptible to ideological distortion, when the transfer of the original\u000a      text into a different language fails to acknowledge or analyse subtle\u000a      cultural differences [output 1]. These problems have become all the more\u000a      acute given the expansion of unregulated training courses in translation.\u000a      In an environment in which translation is often outsourced to\u000a      practitioners with insufficient and static understanding of the political,\u000a      social, professional and industrial texts on which they work - or indeed\u000a      to automated translation systems - skilled translation requires more than\u000a      solely linguistic competence; it requires continuing cultural awareness,\u000a      and a pragmatic and theoretical understanding of how to conduct research\u000a      based on valid and reliable sources. By proposing strategies to strengthen\u000a      this awareness among student translators, Federici identifies concrete\u000a      solutions to the challenges posed by culturally under- informed\u000a      translations.\u000a    Federici's research emphasises the agency of translators in the transfer\u000a      of knowledge, and their potentially fraught role in technical, practical\u000a      and cultural transmission. In his examination of Italian newspapers'\u000a      account of a US military report dealing with the friendly-fire killing of\u000a      an Italian security agent in Iraq [output 1], he demonstrates that\u000a      linguistic choices made by translators introduced ideological inflections,\u000a      with the effect of legitimising Italian complaints that the report\u000a      expressed particular American perspectives and interests. In a study of\u000a      the English voice-overs and subtitles for the 2005 Italian satirical\u000a      docu-film Viva Zapatero! [output 2], Federici shows that the force\u000a      of the satire was lost and that the meanings were subject to what he terms\u000a      `oblique censorship' because the translation failed to match the\u000a      complexity of the original work. Federici argues that the potential for\u000a      achieving high-quality translations is impeded by the lack of appropriate\u000a      training to promote self-assessment among translators throughout their\u000a      careers [output 3].\u000a    In addressing this problem, Federici demonstrates the benefit of\u000a      programmes of translation studies designed to promote self-reflective\u000a      critical practice. As both translators and their texts are culturally\u000a      embedded, it is imperative that the training of translators instils\u000a      habitual sensitivity towards cultural and ideological differences. His\u000a      central proposal is that continuous learning and `self-correction' should\u000a      be at the heart of the training of translators, thereby preparing students\u000a      for a life-long career as translators. A key aspect of this process of\u000a      self-assessment is continuing attention to changing culturally-specific\u000a      nuances. Federici argues that student translators, having submitted their\u000a      work for assessment and after receiving guidance, should have the\u000a      opportunity to resubmit the work. This opportunity to resubmit encourages\u000a      positive `self-correction'. This cycle of practice and self-assessment\u000a      promotes cross-cultural responsibility as well as linguistic judgement.\u000a    Federici's focus on translators' skills as a preventive measure against\u000a      instances of weak and ideological translations led to his collaboration\u000a      with the European Masters in Translation body in organising and writing\u000a      original policy documents. These require that teachers are trained to\u000a      instil in students the practices of dynamic, continuous and independent\u000a      learning and self-correction. Students thereby develop the necessary\u000a      skills to be active researchers in their particular areas of specialism as\u000a      these change or emerge during their career.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13196","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dr Antonello's research was instrumental for the realization of the\u000a      exhibit.

He suggested the inclusion of specific works by Munari and\u000a      supervised the production\u000a      of the catalogue, also suggesting some of the contributors to the\u000a      catalogue and liaising with them.\u000a      His analysis of the influence of Futurist art in the early Munari's\u000a      production was fleshed out by the\u000a      exhibition, with the inclusion of almost all the works that Dr Antonello\u000a      discusses in the essay listed\u000a      in the references to the research (n. 2). The director of the Estorick\u000a      Collection acknowledged Dr\u000a      Antonello's key contribution to the organization of the exhibit, with\u000a      relevant meetings in Italy and in\u000a      London, and with a fundamental contribution to the catalogue. The\u000a      co-curator of the exhibit also\u000a      flagged Dr Antonello's `ideational inspiration' for the exhibit, as well\u000a      as, his `generous work which\u000a      contributed to the historical and scientific coherence of the project',\u000a      and to the `authoritative\u000a      academic validation' he gave to the show.\u000a    Dr Antonello also gave an introductory Gallery talk at the Estorick on 29\u000a      Sep 2012, attended by\u000a      around 40 people, in which he highlighted to a general audience some of\u000a      the key features of the\u000a      exhibition, including Munari's debt to artists such as Enrico Prampolini\u000a      and Fortunato Depero, as\u000a      well as its most innovative artistic breakthrough of his early career like\u000a      the so-called `useless\u000a      machines'.\u000a    The exhibition was well attended and from the feedback we gathered it is\u000a      apparent that the exhibit\u000a      attracted the attention of an international audience: Odessa Swan, from\u000a      Seattle (USA) on\u000a      21.09.12 said: `Excellent show. I could have stayed in the Munari\u000a      Projection for hours'; James\u000a      Knuckles, from California, on 26.9.2012 wrote: `Very nicely curated\u000a      exhibition. Thank you'; another\u000a      anonymous visitor from Italy, wrote in the guest book: `I would love to\u000a      see this exhibition in Milan'.\u000a      More than thirty reviews have appeared in newspapers and specialized\u000a      on-line magazines, both in\u000a      Italy and in the English-speaking world, including the following: Alice\u000a      Rawsthorn, `At London\u000a      Exhibition, Celebrating a Visual Master', New York Times, 16\u000a      September, 2012; Adrian Hamilton,\u000a      `Bruno Munari: Back to the Futurists.

Twenty of Munari's original works were recently displayed at the\u000a      Firstsite exhibit on\u000a      Xerographies in Colchester (8 Sept. - 10 Nov. 2013). Four works which were\u000a      present at the\u000a      Estorick will be featured at the upcoming exhibition on Italian Futurism\u000a      at the Solomon R.\u000a      Guggenheim Museum in New York (21 Feb. 2014 - 1 Sept 2014). A section of\u000a      the London exhibit\u000a      will also be on display during the same period at the Casa Italiana\u000a      Zerilli-Marim&#242; at New York\u000a      University, New York, which will be also hosting a conference on Munari\u000a      for a more general critical\u000a      appraisal of his work and of his legacy. Prompted by the London exhibit,\u000a      other institutions are also\u000a      considering hosting a retrospective on Munari, like the MUDE in Lisbon,\u000a      and the YU\u000a      Contemporary, in Portland, USA.\u000a    Because of the versatile eclectic nature of Munari's art, the exhibition\u000a      lent itself to all sorts of\u000a      outreach activities, some of which were self-led, while other were\u000a      organized by the Estorick\u000a      Educational Department. Some of the institutions which visited the\u000a      exhibition were: St Mary\u000a      Pancras and, William Tyndale, The Italian School (primary); Wollaston\u000a      School, John of Gaunt\u000a      School, Harrow School (A-level); Middlesex University, London College of\u000a      Communication,\u000a      Westminster University, Birbeck College, City and Guilds of London Art\u000a      School, London\u000a      Metropolitan, University of Warwick, Regent's College, Central St Martins\u000a      (HEI). As part of the\u000a      evaluation form distributed, the teachers from William Tyndale school, who\u000a      came with 30 pupils for\u000a      a 2 hour creative workshop, said their visit was \"inspiring\", \"engaging\"\u000a      and \"encouraged thinking\u000a      and discussion\"; that it \"exceeded their expectations\", \"met curriculum\u000a      requirements and learning\u000a      objectives\" and that they were \"highly satisfied\" with the workshop.\u000a    The exhibit was also of great interest for practitioners and graphic and\u000a      industrial designers. It was\u000a      reviewed by websites like `London Design Guide', and `Archilovers'. A\u000a      roundtable discussion was\u000a      organized at the Estorick on 20 Nov 2012: Brian Webb (Webb&amp;Webb),\u000a      Robert Boon (Inventory\u000a      Studio) and John Walters (Eye Magazine) explored Munari's enduring appeal\u000a      and iconic status\u000a      within the world of contemporary design, attempting to characterise the\u000a      nature of his achievement\u000a      and evaluate its legacy. Eye, the international review of graphic\u000a      design, a quarterly printed\u000a      magazine about graphic design and visual culture published in London since\u000a      1990, devoted the\u000a      issue n. 85 (2013) to Bruno Munari incorporating some of the insights from\u000a      the Estorick exhibition.\u000a    A roundtable discussion open to the public was also organized at UCL,\u000a      with the participation, along\u000a      with Dr Antonello, of Prof Jeffrey Schnapp (Harvard), and Prof Robert\u000a      Lumley (UCL).

His research has also focused on Italian\u000a      Modernism and on Futurism in\u000a      particular, considered as the most innovative art movement in Italian\u000a      Modernist art. More recently\u000a      he has been investigating the nexus between visual art and technology in\u000a      20th century Italy,\u000a      focusing on Bruno Munari as an emblematic case study. Dr Antonello's\u000a      research has unpacked the\u000a      subtle and complex relationship of Munari with the second wave of Futurism\u000a      (1926-1944), a period\u000a      in his production that has been much overlooked by art critics, but which\u000a      was also underplayed by\u000a      the artist himself. Dr Antonello's insight and his active work with\u000a      archives and key collectors of\u000a      Munari's work in Italy led to the idea of an exhibition to be held in UK.\u000a      Given its focus and interest\u000a      in Italian modernist art, the Estorick Collection was approached to host\u000a      the exhibit. A new\u000a      interpretation on Munari's early work has been fleshed out with the\u000a      material exposed at the\u000a      exhibition, making evident both the artist's links to Futurism and how\u000a      much Munari departed from\u000a      their legacy. In particular, the representation of technology and the\u000a      question of dynamism in art,\u000a      key aspects of Futurist aesthetics, has been addressed by Munari in a\u000a      thoroughly innovative and\u000a      imaginative way, through both an ironic distancing, and by combining it\u000a      with formal aspects he\u000a      borrowed from abstractionism, producing some ground-breaking works, like\u000a      the so-called `useless\u000a      machines', or `concave-convex', forerunners of kinetic art. This work on\u000a      Munari is also the first\u000a      instance of a wider project aimed to investigate the relationship between\u000a      art and industry in modern\u000a      Italy with the aim of producing a monograph and a series of exhibitions at\u000a      international level.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13197","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe exhibition `My booke and my selfe': Michel de Montaigne 1533-1592' ran from 4 August-23\u000d\u000aDecember 2008, with 14,526 visits to the Exhibition Centre during the period of the exhibition. In\u000d\u000aaddition to this, the Montaigne Exhibition Site [5.1] received 48,000 hits in 2008, 61,981 hits in\u000d\u000a2009, 57,026 hits in 2010, and 46,197 in 2011. The visitors' book [5.2] shows that a large number\u000d\u000aof non-academic visitors attended the exhibition, with comments from people from as far afield as\u000d\u000aItaly (`This exhibition interested me a lot. I have to read more and more about him', October 2008)\u000d\u000aand Japan (`Thanks for the exhibition. I was very lucky and impressed [by] these rare printings\u000d\u000aincluding the handwriting by the philosopher. These can never [be] seen in Japan', December\u000d\u000a2008). Non-academic blog posters [5.3, 5.4] also showed their appreciation, with one who attended\u000d\u000aPhilip Ford's lecture writing on 25 October 2008, `the lecture room holds fifty people and it was\u000d\u000apleasing that it was almost full &#8212; deservedly so as we were well served by our lecturer', and another\u000d\u000aexpressing how `privileged' he was to be taken on a tour of the collection by Philip Ford.\u000d\u000aThe official opening of the exhibition coincided with an international colloquium devoted to `La\u000d\u000aLibrairie de Montaigne', held in Clare College, and aimed at bringing out the potential riches of the\u000d\u000acollection to be exploited in further research. Delegates, who included some of the world's top\u000d\u000aexperts on Montaigne from France and North America, as well as the UK, attended the opening of\u000d\u000athe Montaigne exhibition at the Library and were invited to a private view of the collection in the\u000d\u000anewly created Montaigne Room in the Rare Books Room. The Montaigne Room provided the\u000d\u000aperfect venue for the delegates to be able to browse and enjoy the collection to the full. One fruitful\u000d\u000aoutcome of the conference was the planned collaboration between the University Library and the\u000d\u000aCESR, Universit&#233; Fran&#231;ois-Rabelais in Tours to digitise books from the collection for Les\u000d\u000aBiblioth&#232;ques Virtuelles Humanistes. As a result, in 2009 the Library signed an agreement with the\u000d\u000aUniversit&#233; Fran&#231;ois-Rabelais, Tours, to digitise eighteen books from the Montaigne Library,\u000d\u000aincluding Montaigne's annotated copy of Lucretius's De rerum natura (1563). This, along with five\u000d\u000aother texts, have been digitised to date [5.5]. The digitisation of the Lucretius has been\u000d\u000aconsiderably enhanced by the transcriptions (both diplomatic and normalised) of the end pages\u000d\u000aand the marginalia in the main text, and the translation of the Latin notes into French, all by Alain\u000d\u000aLegros at the CESR. In this way, this extremely important text has been fully enhanced so as to be\u000d\u000aavailable to a world-wide audience, and preserved in digital form. Furthermore, the CESR have\u000d\u000aobtained funding from the CNRS to set up a project known as MONLOE [5.5]. According to the\u000d\u000aproject description, `the aim of this project is to bring together, in a vast whole which would\u000d\u000arepresent a single author's body of works, the main editions of the Essais, the diachronic edition of\u000d\u000athe Exemplaire de Bordaux, all the works bearing his signature held in various libraries, both public\u000d\u000aand private, and the main works which may be considered as constituting the major sources of the\u000d\u000aEssais. The Gilbert de Botton gift to Cambridge University Library in 2008 gave birth to this project,\u000d\u000awhich is both international and collaborative.' Cambridge is, of course, one of the partners of the\u000d\u000aproject.\u000d\u000aOn 6 May 2009, Maurice Gourdault-Montagne, Ambassador of France to the United Kingdom,\u000d\u000avisited the University Library to view the Montaigne Library. The visit was led by Professor Philip\u000d\u000aFord, and was highly appreciated. Cambridge University and its French Department strive to\u000d\u000amaintain close relations with the French Embassy and its Institute, and this was a useful exercise\u000d\u000ain showcasing our activities.\u000d\u000aThe publication of the conference proceedings: La Librairie de Montaigne (see section 3),\u000d\u000aenhanced both scholarly and public appreciation of the collection. Philip Ford participated in the\u000d\u000aUniversity's Festival of Ideas in October 2008, presenting to an audience of 45, comprising of\u000d\u000apeople from the general public, a lecture on Montaigne's education, his attitude to books, the\u000d\u000aactual room the library was kept in, and the publication and reception of the Essais over the\u000d\u000acenturies. In September 2010, he lectured on `Montaigne and his books' for a group of twenty-five\u000d\u000avisitors to the Library taking part in the University's Alumni Weekend, and gave an interview in\u000d\u000a2012 on the collection to The Philanthropist, a magazine sent to donors to the University by its\u000d\u000aDevelopment Office. It is hoped to raise money for further, related acquisitions, and funding to\u000d\u000adigitise the entire collection.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThis case study focuses on an exhibition of a collection of books owned or written by the great\u000d\u000asixteenth-century writer Michel de Montaigne.

During this time she has\u000d\u000aundertaken many periods of fieldwork in the Channel Islands, which have resulted in publications\u000d\u000ain both English and French on the local Norman French dialects (hereafter referred to as insular\u000d\u000aNorman). Between 2008 and 2013, Dr Jones's research has had two main foci, which together\u000d\u000aconstitute one programme of work.\u000d\u000aThe first element of the research has been undertaking linguistic studies which analyse the\u000d\u000avarieties of insular Norman and their usage. Dr Jones's publications have used original data to\u000d\u000areinforce the fact that all three extant varieties of the dialect are distinct from one another and of\u000d\u000agreat value to the fields of French dialectology and language change. To this end, she has\u000d\u000aexamined and described some of the distinctive linguistic features of insular Norman, relating her\u000d\u000afindings to both the wider Norman linguistic context and also to general theories of linguistic\u000d\u000achange during language obsolescence. Her work has also highlighted that insular Norman will\u000d\u000adisappear in the next decade or so if steps are not put in place immediately to preserve it. She has\u000d\u000astudied the language revitalization movement in Jersey and has discussed this in relation to the\u000d\u000atheoretical framework that currently underpins much existing work on language planning and has\u000d\u000aoutlined strategies to ensure this is successful within the particular sociolinguistic context of Jersey\u000d\u000aNorman French.\u000d\u000aThe second main element of Dr Jones's research has been to produce a monograph, on the\u000d\u000aGuernsey French translations of Thomas Martin (the largest corpus of prose from one pen in\u000d\u000ainsular Norman). Martin's work includes a translation into Guernsey Norman French of the entire\u000d\u000aBible, all the plays of Shakespeare and also plays by Longfellow, Moli&#232;re, Corneille and Racine.\u000d\u000aPrior to Dr Jones's work, this corpus had largely escaped notice &#8212; indeed, it had been believed that\u000d\u000aa large part of the 295 books of translations was missing and possibly no longer extant. Dr Jones's\u000d\u000awork revealed that the translations were all still in Guernsey, demonstrated that some of the details\u000d\u000aabout them needed to be revised and highlighted their significance for French dialectology.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"13201","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe impact of the research strand has consisted in (a) seeding an overall conceptualisation and\u000d\u000aspecific ideas which have been incorporated in the work of forensic phonetic practitioners, (b)\u000d\u000aprovision of reference data which practitioners can make use of, (c) availability of the DyViS\u000d\u000adatabase which can be used by them for test and development, and (d) public engagement.\u000d\u000a(a) ideas incorporated in the work of forensic practitioners\u000d\u000aJ P French Associates (JPFA) at York have taken up the challenge, thrown down in Nolan (2005),\u000d\u000aof using auditory profiling of voice quality in speaker comparison casework. After testing Laver's\u000d\u000avoice quality framework on a beta version of the DyViS database (see section (b), below), profiling\u000d\u000awas routinely incorporated in casework (where appropriate) from 2009 to provide an additional set\u000d\u000aof parameters potentially separating incriminating and suspect speech samples. This brings a\u000d\u000adegree of systematic analysis to a facet of speaker comparison (`voice quality') which was\u000d\u000apreviously the domain of rather vague observations [5.1].\u000d\u000aThe German Bundeskriminalamt (Federal Forensic Laboratory) have introduced, starting in 2008,\u000d\u000athe use of Long-Term Formant analysis (Nolan &amp; Grigoras 2005) as an additional tool for\u000d\u000acharacterising speakers [5.2]; and JPFA are testing the technique with a view to introducing it into\u000d\u000acasework [5.1].\u000d\u000a(b) provision of reference data which forensic practitioners can make use of\u000d\u000aThe statistical distributions derived from the 100-speaker DyViS sample population, reported in\u000d\u000aHudson et al. (2007), have been widely consulted by forensic practitioners. Previously the pitch\u000d\u000acharacteristics of speech samples under comparison had to be referred to normative data on other\u000d\u000alanguages, notably German. From 2008 J P French Associates [5.1], Martin Barry Forensic Voice\u000d\u000aServices [5.3], and Duckworth Consultancy [5.4] all report using the DyViS reference data when\u000d\u000aevaluating differences in pitch between incriminating and suspect speech samples.\u000d\u000a(c) availability of the DyViS database\u000d\u000aThe DyViS database, with its 100 accent-matched speakers performing a stylistic range of\u000d\u000aspeaking tasks, has facilitated development and practice across a wide range of activities related\u000d\u000ato speech and speaker analysis:\u000d\u000aOxford Wave Research Ltd. have used a subset of it in their development since 2012 of two\u000d\u000asoftware products, one (`VOCALISE') which performs speaker recognition by combining more\u000d\u000atraditional automatic parameters with phonetic variables, and the other (`CLEAVER') which extracts\u000d\u000athe speech of one speaker from multi-speaker recordings. These are now used by UK and\u000d\u000aEuropean law enforcement organisations and UK government as well as private companies,\u000d\u000aincluding the Metropolitan Police, the German Bundeskriminalamt, and several whose identities\u000d\u000acannot be disclosed [5.5].\u000d\u000aJ P French Associates (JPFA) have used the whole database extensively in testing the\u000d\u000aperformance of an automatic speaker verification system (the Agnitio S.L. `Batvox' system) on\u000d\u000aforensically quasi-naturalistic speech from the database. Generally favourable results having been\u000d\u000aobtained, this system has been used in certain types of case since 2011 to corroborate JPFA's\u000d\u000aforensic opinion from more traditional forensic phonetic techniques. Second, the database was\u000d\u000acrucial in JPFA's testing of voice quality profiling prior to its introduction to casework (see (a),\u000d\u000aabove). Only with the availability of a large accent-matched, controlled database was it possible to\u000d\u000atest the method's discriminative power, and collecting such data would have been beyond the\u000d\u000ascope of a firm engaged in casework on a day-to-day basis [5.1].\u000d\u000aMartin Barry Forensic Voice Services have used the DyViS database to test various technical\u000d\u000aenhancements for their casework, including software for plotting the formants (resonances) of\u000d\u000aspeech on a psychoacoustic (`Bark') scale which MBFVS began to use from 2012 [5.3].\u000d\u000aMartin Duckworth of Duckworth Consultancy has explored the occurrence of different kinds of\u000d\u000adisfluency in collaboration with Kirsty McDougall at Cambridge. All speakers, not only those with\u000d\u000astutters, manifest disfluency in their speech, but testing on the DyViS database has shown that\u000d\u000adisfluency strategies are sufficiently distinctive to be incorporated in forensic speaker comparison\u000d\u000acasework at Duckworth Consultancy since 2011 [5.4].\u000d\u000a(d) public engagement\u000d\u000aPublic engagement has taken place with the community of legal and forensic practitioners, and\u000d\u000amore widely with the public at large through broadcasts.\u000d\u000aNolan has addressed: the Criminal Bar Association (29\/11\/2008), and the Forensic Human\u000d\u000aIdentification course (Metropolitan Police Training Centre, Hendon 03\/2008 &amp; 2009; Academy of\u000d\u000aForensic Medical Sciences 06\/2011, 03\/2012 and 2013); and both McDougall and Nolan were\u000d\u000afeatured with others in a `BBC Frontiers' edition (12\/12\/2012) dealing with the possibilities and\u000d\u000alimitations of speaker recognition [5.6].\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aIncreasingly in court cases the recorded voice of a perpetrator has to be compared with that of a\u000d\u000asuspect.

The general research direction, applying phonetics to speaker identification, was\u000d\u000adefined in Nolan's (1983, reprinted 2009) The Phonetic Bases of Speaker Recognition and\u000d\u000asummarised accessibly in Nolan (1997) [3.1]. Subsequent papers, such as Nolan (2005) [3.3]\u000d\u000achallenging the lack of use in forensic casework of Laver's framework for voice quality analysis,\u000d\u000aand Nolan and Grigoras (2005) [3.2] demonstrating and advocating the use of long-term average\u000d\u000aformant analysis, have dealt with specific areas of phonetic description and subsequently\u000d\u000ainfluenced practice in forensic casework.\u000d\u000aCentral to forensic speaker comparison is knowing: (a) how the speech of an individual can vary,\u000d\u000aand (b) how much variation there is among speakers in the larger population. The lack of\u000d\u000apopulation statistics relevant to (b) has been often lamented, but is explicable given the multiplicity\u000d\u000aof quantifiable properties in speech, the mix of linguistic and personal factors determining a\u000d\u000aperson's speech, and the fact that each speaker is a `moving target', producing quite different\u000d\u000aspeech on different occasions. To help rectify this Nolan undertook the ESRC-funded Dynamic\u000d\u000avariability in speech: a forensic study of British English [DyViS] [3.6].\u000d\u000a`DyViS' made tractable the problem that linguistic and personal information are convolved in\u000d\u000aspeech by controlling for linguistic variation, and recording 100 speakers closely matched for\u000d\u000aaccent, and within a narrow age-range (18-25). By controlling in this way, the range of variation\u000d\u000aattributable solely to personal voice characteristics (resulting from anatomy and individual speech\u000d\u000ahabits) can be studied. This is the `limiting case' for voice ID, where no difference of accent is\u000d\u000aapparent. Furthermore, the DyViS database [3.5] includes four different speaking tasks (two\u000d\u000ainvolving spontaneous dialogue, one of these being a telephone call recorded in high quality and\u000d\u000aover the telephone line), and (for 20 of the speakers) a second recording at a later date, so that\u000d\u000awithin-speaker variation can be estimated. The database [created 2006-2011] constitutes a\u000d\u000aresource of wide utility for forensic (and other) speech research. For instance, at the 2012\u000d\u000aConference of the International Association for Forensic Phonetics and Acoustics 7 out of 25 oral\u000d\u000apresentations reported research using the DyViS database.\u000d\u000aAs exemplars of the use of the DyViS database, the Cambridge group derived fundamental\u000d\u000afrequency (`voice pitch') statistics for the 100 speakers as in Hudson et al.

Digitisation and Preservation of Fragile Material\u000d\u000a    The project has made a significant contribution to library resources by\u000d\u000a      ensuring the conservation in digital form of fragile material (4500 items\u000d\u000a      in the UL and BL) thus contributing to the preservation and\u000d\u000a        presentation of cultural heritage. By the end of July 2013\u000d\u000a      digitization of all the material was complete and 69% of all the material\u000d\u000a      had been catalogued.

[5.1]\u000d\u000a    2. Exhibition\u000d\u000a    The project includes an exhibition at the UL, April to December 2013,\u000d\u000a      thus contributing to presentation of cultural heritage and enhancing\u000d\u000a        the quality of the tourist experience. The exhibition, `Read all\u000d\u000a      about it! Wrongdoing in Spain and England in the long nineteenth century'\u000d\u000a      showcases items of popular literature being digitized and catalogued in\u000d\u000a      the project, and puts them into play with comparable items from England.\u000d\u000a      This contextualizes the Spanish material, and makes more immediate the\u000d\u000a      suggestions of connexion with English history and culture, both\u000d\u000a      historically and in contemporary life. By following a life-cycle from the\u000d\u000a      education of the child to the retribution meted out to the wrongdoer, the\u000d\u000a      exhibition maps out a well-structured narrative of choice and action, and\u000d\u000a      social reaction in the two cultures. From its inception the project has\u000d\u000a      been outward-looking, and has engaged regularly with non-academic\u000d\u000a      audiences. Significantly the exhibition is accompanied by a virtual\u000d\u000a      exhibition [5.2], which will continue to be available via the UL website.\u000d\u000a      By the end of July 2013 there had been 4074 hits to this website, and 9577\u000d\u000a      visits to the physical exhibition [5.3]. The project also has and will\u000d\u000a      continue to have widespread and public visibility through the Digital\u000d\u000a      Library page of the UL [5.4].\u000d\u000a    The Cambridge exhibition derives its narrative from work being done by\u000d\u000a      Sinclair, and is evident in the sections that track a life-cycle from\u000d\u000a      childhood to final retribution. `Knowing Right from Wrong', relating to\u000d\u000a      visual culture and material for children, (material published in item 6\u000d\u000a      (2012) of Section 2); two sections on parent\/child frictions draw on the\u000d\u000a      Vilaseca Memorial Lecture, given by Sinclair in 2011; work on bandits as\u000d\u000a      heroes is published (2011) and submitted for the REF; `What you see is\u000d\u000a      what you get' relates to Sinclair's work in eugenics as in items 2, 3, and\u000d\u000a      4 of Section 2); `Unnatural women' and `Monstrous criminals' were\u000d\u000a      discussed in the Vilaseca lecture as were issues of reaction and reception\u000d\u000a      of the culture of wrongdoing. The exhibition material has been presented\u000d\u000a      to non-academic audiences: an open discussion in collaboration with Anglia\u000d\u000a      Ruskin School of Art, 7.5.2013, including a Visiting Leverhulme Fellow,\u000d\u000a      and staff in Art and Illustration; the Cambridge Bibliographical Society\u000d\u000a      (including library staff) 15.5.13; visit of 30 ten-year old pupils\u000d\u000a      (Parkwood Primary, Hackney) 21.5.13, with pre-exhibition discussion; visit\u000d\u000a      of European librarians to conservation department of UL and exhibition\u000d\u000a      20.6.13; 40 sixteen-year olds from secondary school in Cumbria 24.6.13. A\u000d\u000a      teacher with the Parkwood Primary visit commented \"The pre- exhibition\u000d\u000a      lecture\/discussion was valuable, providing a focus for what followed. The\u000d\u000a      children began to pay close attention in the `question and answer'\u000d\u000a      session, seeming to follow the discussion\" [5.5].\u000d\u000a    The exhibition has been reviewed in the Times Higher Education\u000d\u000a        Supplement (2.5.13) , Culture 24, (29.4.13) [5.6], Visit\u000d\u000a        Cambridge (29.4.13) [5.7] and in the Cambridge Evening News\u000d\u000a      (30.4.13).\u000d\u000a    3.Education\u000d\u000a    The project has already had impact within education. In the\u000d\u000a      sphere of HE, it was the source for 8 hours of Master's teaching at the\u000d\u000a      Universidad Juan Carlos, Madrid, February 2012 [5.8], to an international\u000d\u000a      audience comprising students from Spain, Latin America and China. Talks to\u000d\u000a      secondary schools on the representation of the Spanish bandit has\u000d\u000a      contributed to access and outreach programmes, and school audiences at St\u000d\u000a      Paul's Boys School, London (11.5.11), and Petchey Academy for Girls,\u000d\u000a      Hackney (23.2.12), have been presented with the question of the\u000d\u000a      construction of crime at the same time as the talk has been an\u000d\u000a      illustration of the broad nature of work that can be entered into by those\u000d\u000a      studying foreign languages. Positive feedback has come from both schools.\u000d\u000a      A teacher from St Paul's wrote: \"Thank you so much for taking the time to\u000d\u000a      come to St. Paul's and speak to the boys.

The focus of this case study is the\u000d\u000a      impact of her AHRC-funded project `Wrongdoing in Spain 1808-1936:\u000d\u000a      Realities, Representations, Reactions\", which began on 1 May 2011. The\u000d\u000a      research underpinning this project, relating to the fundamental concept of\u000d\u000a      the gap between the realities of wrongdoing, and its cultural\u000d\u000a      representation, is articulated in three books (2001, 2007 and 2009).\u000d\u000a    Sinclair's 2001 book on Unamuno (1864-1936) broke new ground in\u000d\u000a      establishing the range and quality of the familiarity of this philosopher\u000d\u000a      and novelist with work in the sciences as well as his broad humanities\u000d\u000a      culture, and included his understanding of what constituted wrongdoing\u000d\u000a      (elaborated further in a chapter in a forthcoming Companion to Unamuno).\u000d\u000a      Her 2007 study on Sex and Society in Early 20th-Century\u000a        Spain (2007) (shortly to appear in a second edition) explored the\u000d\u000a      history of the complex reception and development of both eugenics and\u000d\u000a      sexual reform in Spain through the figure of Hildegart Rodr&#237;guez. The\u000d\u000a      centrality of issues concerning the judgment of wrongdoing, specifically\u000d\u000a      in relation to the murder of Hildegart by her mother led to the\u000d\u000a      conceptualization of the Wrongdoing project. Her 2009 study, Trafficking\u000a        Knowledge in Early 20th'Century Spain,\u000d\u000a      focused on two areas relevant to the project: the cultural imaginaries\u000d\u000a      involved in cultural exchanges, and the significance of literature\u000d\u000a      produced for a popular market, particularly explored in Chapter 1.\u000d\u000a    The above publications were all sole-scholar pieces of research. In\u000d\u000a      addition there is Sinclair's convening of two conferences, leading to the\u000d\u000a      organization and editing of papers for two volumes in which she also\u000d\u000a      published her own papers, the 2004 publication on Alternative\u000d\u000a        Discourses in Early Twentieth-Century Spain (2004) (with Richard\u000d\u000a      Cleminson, Reader in Spanish History, University of Leeds), and Eugenics,\u000a        Sex and the State (2008) (with Richard Cleminson and Martin\u000d\u000a      Richards, emeritus professor, Centre for Family Research, University of\u000d\u000a      Cambridge).

Young served as consultant to the artistic\u000a      director, passing on objects from his personal collection (which later\u000a      formed part of the show), establishing vital contacts, writing the major\u000a      essay for the brochure, and giving a reading in the events series.\u000a      According to the artistic director, Young `brought to the project an\u000a      extremely rare understanding of both the creative process and political\u000a      history', and the resulting exhibition `could not have achieved its\u000a      success without his collaboration'. It attracted over 2000 visitors and\u000a      was widely covered and praised in the media for its inventive use of sport\u000a      and history to mediate matters of contemporary concern.

Since 2012 he has been\u000a      Professor of Modern and Medieval German Studies.\u000a    Young's research on the history of the Olympics in modern Germany began\u000a      in 2003 and issued in The 1972 Munich Olympics and the Making of\u000a        Modern Germany (co-authored with K. Schiller, University of Durham:\u000a      the book was fully collaborative), which appeared with the University of\u000a      California Press in 2010, and a total of 9 (mainly single-authored)\u000a      journal articles and book chapters. The monograph is the first book-length\u000a      treatment (and indeed virtually the first academic treatment overall) of\u000a      one of the most famous Games in Olympic history. It was based on extensive\u000a      archival research in Germany, Switzerland and the US and interviews with a\u000a      number of key participants such as a surviving Israeli athlete (Dan Alon)\u000a      and East German spy-master Markus Wolf.\u000a    This body of work addressed a wide range of themes: the complexities of\u000a      Olympic financing in a federal state; urban planning at a time of\u000a      demographic growth, increasing municipal demands and diminishing coffers;\u000a      memory culture and `Vergangenheitsbew&#228;ltigung'; architecture and design as\u000a      contested symbols of a new Germany; the developing discourse of democratic\u000a      participation and the various outgrowths of youth revolt in the 1960s; the\u000a      long war of attrition for sporting recognition between the GDR and the FRG\u000a      on the international scene; the security errors that led to the 1972\u000a      Olympic terrorist attack, and the complicated diplomatic fall-out that\u000a      resulted from it. The insights that led most frequently to sustained\u000a      impact effects were those that dealt with: the powerful role of sporting\u000a      elites and the IOC as NGO over and above that of state and federal\u000a      agencies; the complicity of the West German government in `bribing'\u000a      African nations after decolonization with direct aid and gifts of sporting\u000a      infrastructure; the paradox of the IOC's continued admiration in the 1960s\u000a      for Berlin 1936 and the host nation's determined abhorrence of it;\u000a      paradoxically, the conscious use of the 1936 blueprint by leading left\u000a      liberal design elites in order to present a diametrically opposed vision\u000a      of the new Germany; the important but often neglected influence of the\u000a      1945- rather than 1968-generation on the discourses of democracy and\u000a      participation that helped cement German society in the 1960s and 1970s;\u000a      the role of big business in Cold War Western allegiances, e.g. Krupp,\u000a      which called on the legacy of 1936 to shore up its position in the\u000a      present; the fact that, despite appearances, the Games hardly breathed the\u000a      spirit of Ostpolitik &#8212; the East and West German sports systems were locked\u000a      into an intractable conflict that Munich exacerbated rather than improved;\u000a      the full diplomatic context in which Black September's attack on the\u000a      Israeli team took place, which threatened to unravel Germany's concerted\u000a      efforts at rapprochement across the Arab world; and finally the\u000a      contextualisation of the terrorist attack in the history of security,\u000a      which showed that not only the Germans but also the SAS and the special\u000a      forces of the USA and France were powerless to resolve an unprecedented\u000a      military situation.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13739","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aContribution to economic impact and personal and professional development\u000d\u000aUntil relatively recently there was widespread antagonism between metal-detectorists and the\u000d\u000aacademic community. But the dialogue between Anglo-Saxon numismatists and metal-detector\u000d\u000ausers of non-academic background, spearheaded by Dr Blackburn, has been mutually beneficial:\u000d\u000adetectorists, collectors and dealers have learned how important their finds are and collaborated\u000d\u000aclosely with scholars to generate significant impact.\u000d\u000aA symbiotic involvement with the non-academic community has become integral to research on\u000d\u000aearly medieval currency. Scholars have made use of detector finds, and finders have in turn gained\u000d\u000aappreciation of their coins' heritage significance, and hence also the importance of recording them.\u000d\u000aThis has been accomplished by disseminating conclusions of the research outlined above at\u000d\u000ameetings of local societies and numerous popular talks and conferences. Dr Naismith delivered\u000d\u000atalks on relevant subjects to local numismatic and metal detecting societies in Cambridge on 21\u000d\u000aMay 2008 and 15 March 2010, in Nottingham on 11 September 2009 and in Worthing on 21\u000d\u000aOctober 2010, each attended by 20-50 people. The impact of these initiatives is shown in the\u000d\u000adozens of contacts initiated each year by individual finders, dealers and collectors; they are\u000d\u000areflected in, among others, EMC, Blackburn 2011 and Naismith 2011.\u000d\u000aThe efforts of Dr Blackburn and Dr Naismith have created such impact among enthusiasts and the\u000d\u000acommercial sector that the value of recording single-find data that a reliable find-provenance now\u000d\u000aadds significantly to a coin's commercial value. It is commonplace to find data drawn from EMC\u000d\u000aand other research outputs quoted in auction catalogues (e.g., Spink auction 13 December 2011,\u000d\u000alots 1-16, drawing on Naismith 2011; Time Line 14 December 2012, lot 108 and 19 March 2010,\u000d\u000alot 195 drawing on EMC). These and many other legitimately discovered coins would never\u000d\u000aotherwise have come to scholarly attention were they not reported by commercial dealers such as\u000d\u000aSpink and Time Line, as well as numerous individual finders and collectors. The value of this\u000d\u000asymbiotic relationship was emphasized in a testimonial provided by Person 4 (a senior specialist at\u000d\u000aSpink and Son Ltd): `I have used the Fitzwilliam Museum Corpus of Early Medieval coins database\u000d\u000afor some years. This resource ... has proved invaluable. It has provided us with a research tool\u000d\u000awhen cataloguing coins for auction as it allows us to match and reference a coin with others from\u000d\u000athe same dies. Additionally its recording of new single finds, allows us to create a provenance for\u000d\u000aeach coin which will remain with the coin into the future. This is something which is welcomed both\u000d\u000aby finders as sellers and collectors as buyers. The work undertaken by Mark and his staff in\u000d\u000abuilding this database has been invaluable and reaches across both the scholastic and commercial\u000d\u000aarms of Numismatics as a research tool and record of coins' (personal communication, 8 June\u000d\u000a2012).\u000d\u000aPreserving and presenting cultural heritage\u000d\u000aThe systematic recording of thousands of early medieval coin finds by Dr Blackburn and Dr\u000d\u000aNaismith (as outlined above) in itself creates major impact through the preservation of cultural\u000d\u000aheritage. Moreover, an important counterpart to the economic and personal development of\u000d\u000adealers and dedicated enthusiasts is presentation of the results of research to the general public.\u000d\u000aMuseum exhibitions have been the principal means of doing so. An exhibition (`Anglo-Saxon Art in\u000d\u000athe Round') in the Fitzwilliam Museum, curated by Dr Blackburn, focused on the historical\u000d\u000asignificance of Anglo-Saxon coinage (2008). It was arranged to showcase points and themes\u000d\u000araised by the research of Dr Blackburn and Dr Naismith (e.g. in Blackburn 2003) about the\u000d\u000aeconomic role of the coinage and the insights it provides into the cultural history of eastern\u000d\u000aEngland in the eighth century. During three months in Cambridge this exhibition drew some 20,000\u000d\u000avisitors and activities accompanying it included well-attended public lectures, handling sessions for\u000d\u000adisabled visitors and workshops for children (person 2). A similar range of activities at Ipswich\u000d\u000ainvolved 450 participants. It also set a precedent for regional collaboration, and (in the words of an\u000d\u000aoral testimonial given by Person 3) has left a `significant legacy' of co-operation between the\u000d\u000amuseums involved (the Fitzwilliam Museum, Norwich Castle Museum and Ipswich and Colchester\u000d\u000aMuseum Services).\u000d\u000aIn this way productive engagement with finders and buyers of coins, and increased awareness\u000d\u000aamong the general public, combine to show the range and depth of impact this research has\u000d\u000aachieved outside the academic world.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aIn the past five years, the research of Dr Mark Blackburn and Dr Rory Naismith has been crucial to\u000d\u000atransforming the personal and professional development of amateur metal detectorists and\u000d\u000acollectors.

Principal outputs have taken two forms: electronic\u000d\u000adatabases and printed publications recording coin-finds; and books and articles interpreting this\u000d\u000amaterial.\u000d\u000aPublication of new finds has been on-going since the early 1980s. New coin-finds began to\u000d\u000aproliferate with the growth of amateur metal-detecting, bringing the risk that details of provenance\u000d\u000amight go unrecorded. Initial publications by Dr Blackburn gave rise to the `Coin Register' in 1987.\u000d\u000aThis continues to appear annually in the British Numismatic Journal, typically listing some 400\u000d\u000aearly medieval coin-finds, including over fifty contributed by Dr Blackburn and Dr Naismith\u000d\u000apersonally in the period 2008-13. In 1997, Dr Blackburn established the Corpus of Early Medieval\u000d\u000aCoin Finds (EMC) with a three-year major research grant from the Leverhulme Trust, and\u000d\u000asubsequent funding from the British Academy. This national online database covers coin-finds from\u000d\u000athe period c. 410-1180, and now contains details and images of some 10,000 specimens. In 2000\u000d\u000aDr Blackburn expanded the project to incorporate coins in museum collections published in the\u000d\u000aBritish Academy's major research project `Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles', resulting in a\u000d\u000adatabase of c. 50,000 coins in museum collections. This is the biggest on-line database of\u000d\u000amedieval coins in the world, and a major contribution to research into the early medieval coinage of\u000d\u000athe British Isles. The set-up and maintenance of these databases throughout the period to 2013\u000d\u000ahas in itself been a major research enterprise.\u000d\u000aThe second component of the research has been interpretation of new material. The volume of\u000d\u000acoin-finds and the quality of their recording have grown so dramatically that they have\u000d\u000arevolutionised understanding of the Anglo-Saxon monetary economy. The EMC has provided\u000d\u000amaterial for reassessment of individual coinages and also for broader studies (e.g. Naismith 2012).\u000d\u000aProbably the most significant outcome has been a clearer picture of the overall distribution of coin-\u000d\u000afinds (Blackburn 2005). Thanks to these new discoveries, the contours of the monetary economy\u000d\u000aare now better known for England than for any other part of early medieval Europe. An important\u000d\u000asurprise came in the prominence of the period c. 680-740, which now stands out as a peak in coin-\u000d\u000ause: the richest between the end of Roman Britain and the thirteenth century (Blackburn 2003). Dr\u000d\u000aBlackburn has also played a major role in highlighting `productive sites': specific locations which\u000d\u000ahave produced numerous single-finds, presumably denoting a site of some significance (Blackburn\u000d\u000a2003). One important example is Torksey, Lincolnshire, which is known to have been a Viking\u000d\u000acamp in 872\/3, and which has produced one of the largest and most diagnostic assemblages of\u000d\u000aScandinavian material from any British site (Blackburn 2002). In these ways, the efforts of\u000d\u000aamassing and publishing coin-finds have paid major dividends not only for numismatists, but for all\u000d\u000ascholars of Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Scandinavian culture.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"13839","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The psycholinguistic framework benefits children with speech, language\u000d\u000a      and communication needs, by improving outcomes of speech intelligibility\u000d\u000a      and literacy acquisition. This is achieved through the impact of the\u000d\u000a      framework on the practices and policies of the key individuals and groups\u000d\u000a      who work with and for these children. There is thus a spectrum of vertical\u000d\u000a      impact: through university courses, via SLT\/ education practitioners and\u000d\u000a      policy makers to the individual children who have these difficulties. The\u000d\u000a      horizontal reach of the impact is considerable, as the framework has been\u000d\u000a      adopted internationally. The significance of the framework is that it has\u000d\u000a      changed teaching methods in SLT higher education, SLT policy and the way\u000d\u000a      children's speech difficulties are approached. While the basic assessment\u000d\u000a      framework was developed and disseminated prior to 2000, subsequent\u000d\u000a      research on the design and implementation of therapy interventions since\u000d\u000a      Stackhouse and Wells moved to Sheffield in 2000 has impacted on the\u000d\u000a      training of SLTs and on the practice of therapists during the REF census\u000d\u000a      period.\u000d\u000a    The impact has been achieved through a sustained process of engagement by\u000d\u000a      the researchers with professional practitioners, including SLTs and\u000d\u000a      teachers as well as university lecturers. This has taken the form of\u000d\u000a      continuing education courses, delivered inside and outside the university;\u000d\u000a      articles in journals read by practitioners; presentations at practitioner\u000d\u000a      conferences; and contributions to the policy development of the\u000d\u000a      professional bodies and charities that can influence practice with\u000d\u000a      children who have speech and literacy difficulties. Underpinning these\u000d\u000a      activities are the books by Stackhouse, Wells and collaborators, which are\u000d\u000a      presented in a way that is accessible to students and practitioners alike.\u000d\u000a      Cumulative sales of the four books in the series from 1\/1\/2008 to 30\/7\/13\u000d\u000a      are 2,449, and books 1 and 4 are available as e-books. The sales of Books\u000d\u000a      1-3 prior to 2008, 11,244 in total, help to account for the subsequent\u000d\u000a      impact of the framework [S1].\u000d\u000a    Impact on speech and language therapy educators\u000d\u000a      The main pathway to impact on speech and language professionals is through\u000d\u000a      training and education. The framework has been adopted on virtually all\u000d\u000a      undergraduate and postgraduate speech and language therapy (SLT) courses\u000d\u000a      in the UK, influencing the design and delivery of the curriculum. There is\u000d\u000a      strong evidence from UK SLT lecturers that they have integrated the\u000d\u000a      framework into their own teaching practice. In a questionnaire survey of\u000d\u000a      all UK SLT qualification degree programmes (excluding University of\u000d\u000a      Sheffield) conducted March-July 2013, responses were received from all 22\u000d\u000a      programmes. In 2008-2013, c.3,900 SLT students, on 21 of these 22\u000d\u000a      programmes, received lecture teaching on the psycholinguistic framework.\u000d\u000a      Of these, c.2,500 SLT students, on 14 of the programmes, were required by\u000d\u000a      their lecturers to engage more deeply with the framework, for instance in\u000d\u000a      workshops, in clinical practice or in project assignments. The large\u000d\u000a      majority of these students have gone on or will go on to work in SLT or\u000d\u000a      closely related fields. The following comments made by lecturers from\u000d\u000a      different universities when responding to the survey, indicate the\u000d\u000a      pedagogical value of the framework [S2]:\u000d\u000a    \"We have found that using the psycholinguistic framework in teaching\u000d\u000a        is a really valuable way to get students thinking in much more detail\u000d\u000a        and more critically about children's speech impairments.\"\u000d\u000a    \"It really helps focus the students to make hypothesis driven\u000d\u000a        differential diagnoses for children with developmental phonological\u000d\u000a        difficulties. It also highlights issues of assessment \/ task demands.\"\u000d\u000a    \"We introduce it in level 4 as a basic model and then in detail in\u000d\u000a        level 5 and we expect application of thinking in all of the clinical\u000d\u000a        placement modules where relevant.\"\u000d\u000a    \"We have had some excellent Year 3 projects which have looked at some\u000d\u000a        aspect of management for speech and\/or literacy difficulties using the\u000d\u000a        psycholinguistic framework. In at least one case, the project was\u000d\u000a        instrumental in securing the student's first job!\"\u000d\u000a    \"Not sure how I would teach without it, or how clinicians manage\u000d\u000a        without it!\"\u000d\u000a    Impact on speech and language therapy services\u000d\u000a      The wider impact of the psycholinguistic framework on clinical services is\u000d\u000a      evidenced by the fact that SLT's have integrated the approach into their\u000d\u000a      own working practices, including assessment procedures and intervention\u000d\u000a      programmes.\u000d\u000a    In a recent survey of the Southern RCSLT Special Interest Group (SIG) on\u000d\u000a      Speech Difficulties, 22 SLTs responded (18 from the NHS, 4 in independent\u000d\u000a      practice). Twenty-one use the framework in their practice from preschool\u000d\u000a      to secondary age children, each averaging around 25 children per year. All\u000d\u000a      use it when assessing a child's difficulties; 80% use it when carrying out\u000d\u000a      intervention, and over half also for training purposes. 60% ranked the PLF\u000d\u000a      as 'very' or `extremely' useful. According to one respondent, \"Stackhouse\u000a        and Wells have provided speech therapists with an excellent clinical\u000d\u000a        framework to collect data, analyse data and draw inferences in order to\u000d\u000a        think of treatment plans for children with speech disorders\".\u000d\u000a      Another specialist commented: \"It's a large part of the way I work\".\u000d\u000a    Moving from the individual practitioner to the organisational context,\u000d\u000a      the Cambridgeshire NHS SLT service is an example of how a local SLT\u000d\u000a      service has integrated the framework into its assessment and intervention\u000d\u000a      process: \"The approach has become embedded in how we talk about\u000d\u000a        children's speech\" [S3]. The potential for impact is still\u000d\u000a      greater when therapists publish a programme that draws on the framework.\u000d\u000a      An example is the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme (NDP), authored by senior\u000d\u000a      SLTs at the Nuffield Hearing and Speech Centre at University College\u000d\u000a      London Hospitals, which is the NHS's national specialist centre for\u000d\u000a      developmental verbal dyspraxia. When the programme was revised in 2004, it\u000d\u000a      was rewritten to incorporate the Stackhouse &amp; Wells framework as its\u000d\u000a      theoretical basis. The NDP has been in wide use in UK SLT services and\u000d\u000a      also overseas during the census period, with 3000 copies sold since 2008 [S4].\u000d\u000a    The impact of the psycholinguistic framework among qualified\u000d\u000a      practitioners has been promoted through extensive Continuing Professional\u000d\u000a      Development (CPD) activities led by the Sheffield research group.\u000d\u000a      Approximately 300 qualified SLTs have undertaken postgraduate certificate,\u000d\u000a      diploma or MSc study at Sheffield during the census period; all have\u000d\u000a      received some training in the psycholinguistic framework and some have\u000d\u000a      conducted research studies using it. In addition, since 2008 Stackhouse\u000d\u000a      has been regularly invited to present updates on the framework to SLT\u000d\u000a      practitioners at in-service training days or to Special Interest Groups in\u000d\u000a      speech, language, and cleft palate e.g. in Leicester, London, Nottingham,\u000d\u000a      Hertfordshire; as well as keynote presentations to multidisciplinary\u000d\u000a      audiences, e.g. Dyslexia and Co-occurring Issues conference run by\u000d\u000a      the British Dyslexia Association, London (2011).\u000d\u000a    Impact on professional bodies and charities as policy forming agencies\u000d\u000a      The impact of the framework in shaping policy for children with speech\u000d\u000a      difficulties is evident from citations in policy documents, position\u000d\u000a      papers and information booklets produced by bodies that serve as agents of\u000d\u000a      change at national level. These include the Royal College of Speech and\u000d\u000a      Language Therapists (RCSLT), which publishes policy statements on clinical\u000d\u000a      conditions, as advice for members of the profession. The framework is\u000d\u000a      cited extensively in its Policy Statement on Developmental Verbal\u000d\u000a      Dyspraxia (2011) [S5], drawing attention to the importance of\u000d\u000a      assessing speech input skills in children whose difficulties hitherto had\u000d\u000a      been considered to be purely with speech output (articulation). ICAN, the\u000d\u000a      children's communication charity, publishes the ICAN talk series\u000d\u000a      for speech and language practitioners. Issue 1 (reprinted 2009) Speech,\u000a        Language and Communication Needs and Literacy Difficulties, cites\u000d\u000a      the framework extensively [S6]. The framework has changed the\u000d\u000a      information clinicians in the NHS and independent practice collect as a\u000d\u000a      basis for a child's intervention programme and has demonstrated how the\u000d\u000a      development of literacy skills can be assessed and integrated into speech\u000d\u000a      and language therapy procedures.\u000d\u000a    Impact beyond the UK\u000d\u000a      The framework is taught on SLT training courses in Europe, Australia,\u000d\u000a      South Africa, and USA as well as in continuing professional development\u000d\u000a      (CPD) for SLTs, special needs teachers, and with parents. It has been\u000d\u000a      adopted beyond the UK as the result of a range of activities and\u000d\u000a      processes. Examples of invitations to Stackhouse to deliver talks and CPD\u000d\u000a      courses on the framework include: Swedish SLT association: Stockholm,\u000d\u000a      2011; Danish SLT CPD Programme: Copenhagen, 2012; Germany ISESVII: Leipzig\u000d\u000a      2012. In addition, S Fricke has run courses on the framework for\u000d\u000a      Swiss-German, German and Austrian SLT CPD Programmes 2008-12, as has M\u000d\u000a      Vance in Greece (2008) and Ireland (2011). SLT PhD students from Germany,\u000d\u000a      South Africa, Malaysia and Taiwan have been supervised by Stackhouse,\u000d\u000a      Wells and colleagues at Sheffield on topics related to the framework,\u000d\u000a      including a joint supervision with a German university. On average four\u000d\u000a      non-UK SLT MSc students each year have undertaken research using the\u000d\u000a      framework, adapting it to their local language and SLT context (Germany,\u000d\u000a      Greece, Hong Kong, Jordan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia).\u000d\u000a    Publications deriving from or extensively citing the framework have\u000d\u000a      appeared in other languages. The first comprehensive test battery of\u000d\u000a      phonological awareness to be devised for the German language is based on\u000d\u000a      the framework: Fricke, S., &amp; Sch&#228;fer, B.

There is extensive citation of the framework in the leading\u000d\u000a      textbook on children's speech difficulties for German-language SLTs: Fox,\u000d\u000a      A: Kindliche Aussprachest&#246;rungen.: Phonologischer Erwerb &#8212;\u000d\u000a        Differenzialdiagnostik &#8212; Therapie (2nded 2005, reprint\u000d\u000a      2011) [S6]. The framework is highlighted by a chapter in a major\u000d\u000a      US textbook: Stackhouse, J. and Pascoe, M. (2010) `A psycholinguistic\u000d\u000a      framework for working with children with speech sound disorders' in\u000d\u000a      Williams, L., McLeod, S. and McCauley, R.

For this\u000d\u000a      reason, Stackhouse and Wells have proposed that successful intervention\u000d\u000a      for children with PSDs depends on describing speech difficulties in\u000d\u000a      phonetic and linguistic terms, then investigating underlying\u000d\u000a      psycholinguistic processing difficulties. These may include problems with\u000d\u000a      speech input (e.g. hearing the difference between similar sounding words\u000d\u000a      like `key' and `tea'); with storage of pronunciation information about\u000d\u000a      words in the child's mental dictionary; or with programming the\u000d\u000a      articulators that produce speech output such as the tongue, lips and soft\u000d\u000a      palate. Professor Bill Wells, a clinical linguist, and Professor Joy\u000d\u000a      Stackhouse, who is dually qualified as a speech and language therapist and\u000d\u000a      developmental psychologist, along with colleagues and students at UCL\u000d\u000a      (1993-2000) and then Sheffield (2000-present), have developed a\u000d\u000a      psycholinguistic framework which enables weaknesses in these underlying\u000d\u000a      processing skills to be identified and then addressed in therapy. Integral\u000d\u000a      to the framework is an assessment of literacy skills, since children with\u000d\u000a      PSDs are at risk for problems with reading and in particular with\u000d\u000a      spelling. The psycholinguistic framework was used in a NHS-funded\u000d\u000a      longitudinal study of children with primary speech difficulties from the\u000d\u000a      age of 3 (1997-2002, PI: Stackhouse). Since arriving in Sheffield in 2000,\u000d\u000a      Stackhouse and her team have shown that those children whose speech\u000d\u000a      processing difficulties are pervasive at age 3 or 4 years are particularly\u000d\u000a      at risk for speech and literacy problems that persist into the school\u000d\u000a      years [R1]. These children perform less well than IQ matched peers on\u000d\u000a      national school attainment tests (SATs), in particular on spelling [R2].\u000d\u000a      In Sheffield, the first important research effort has been to disseminate\u000d\u000a      in book \/CD form the project results and the tests developed for that\u000d\u000a      research, so that they are readily accessible for clinical use by SLTs and\u000d\u000a      by students in training [R3].The second goal has been to extend this\u000d\u000a      approach to psycholinguistic test development in other languages, e.g.\u000d\u000a      German [R4], Greek, Mandarin and Arabic. A third key development at\u000d\u000a      Sheffield has been to devise and implement individualised therapy\u000d\u000a      interventions that are based on the psycholinguistic framework, as\u000d\u000a      reported in [R5] and [R6] for example. As well as demonstrating the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of the psycholinguistic approach, these published case\u000d\u000a      studies provide a model for SLT practitioners and students when planning\u000d\u000a      their own therapy.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13840","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The results of the research described in Section 2 indicate a pressing\u000a      need to support disadvantaged pupils throughout the school years and\u000a      beyond. As a result of our follow-up of disadvantaged adults who had\u000a      attended an ICAN school, more support is given now to 16 year olds moving\u000a      from school to work; workshops are available for their parents; and\u000a      specific teaching on the theory driving test is offered [S1]\u000a      However, the task of supporting language and literacy development in\u000a      mainstream settings needs to be from nursery through to adulthood and is\u000a      of such a scale that it cannot be addressed by speech and language\u000a      therapists alone. It is crucial that school staff are trained to enhance\u000a      children's language, communication, and literacy skills. In collaboration\u000a      with the local education authority, Stackhouse, with HCS colleagues Clegg\u000a      and Trott, has overseen the development and roll-out of training\u000a      programmes for teachers and support workers in schools and nurseries in\u000a      the most socially deprived areas of Sheffield. The result has been a step\u000a      change in the knowledge base of teaching staff in the schools involved, in\u000a      relation to language and literacy, as feedback such as the following\u000a      attests: \"This is the first course I have attended for a while where I\u000a        have learnt new information\" (Nursery nurse); \"It made me think\u000a        about how children actually `pick up' and use vocabulary\" (Primary\u000a      teacher).\u000a    The development of the training programmes delivered in the census period\u000a      has built on an initiative dating from 2005, when sponsorship money from a\u000a      University Tall Ship voyage (&#163;32,000) was secured by Stackhouse for HCS's\u000a      work on supporting socially disadvantaged children in Sheffield in\u000a      collaboration with the then Education Action Zone (EAZ). In 2005-07 we\u000a      piloted the development of training materials with staff in 24 mainstream\u000a      schools. In the school year 2007-08, when the EAZ was replaced by `The\u000a      Learning Year' (LY) in Sheffield, our area of work in Language and\u000a      Communication was the only project retained. In 2008 the LY funded\u000a      teaching cover for 28 staff in 14 schools so that these staff could take\u000a      part in our training programme. Promoting children's vocabulary,\u000a      conversation, listening and attention skills, the programme was delivered\u000a      through talks, workshops, and supervised practice of structured small\u000a      group teaching within the schools. In addition, a senior part-time project\u000a      worker within the school service was funded by the LY to act as a link\u000a      between HCS and the schools. In 2009, additional materials were requested\u000a      to help teachers to support children's early literacy development; these\u000a      became part of the schools' `Every Child A Writer' initiative. The\u000a      training was extended to ten more schools and included nursery staff and\u000a      also staff in a special school, reaching around 1,440 children in 2008-10.\u000a      [S2]\u000a    The impact of the training was felt by all stakeholders:\u000a    a) the staff involved, for instance one teacher reported that \"it\u000a        has given me different strategies to use when teaching vocabulary\";\u000a    b) the pupils, as teachers observed an improvement in their\u000a      listening, attention and vocabulary skills following targeted small group\u000a      work. One teacher reported that \"it has given a group of children\u000a        confidence and more abilities to learn in a class environment\";\u000a    c) the Learning Year itself: the project was a means of\u000a      developing the role and responsibilities of the Teaching Assistants and \"something\u000a        to be proud of &#8212; something professional\". The training handbook\u000a      developed from these training courses was officially launched in November\u000a      2008 and is now in all the nurseries and primary schools that took part,\u000a      also elsewhere by request e.g. Leicester Education Authority. Evidence for\u000a      its impact is the take-up by city-wide children's services, e.g. Every\u000a        Sheffield Child Articulate and Literate (ESCAL) in Sheffield. These\u000a      services have incorporated principles and components from the handbook in\u000a      order to improve the learning potential of their socially disadvantaged\u000a      children. The national Communication Champion [S3], in her `Two\u000a      Years On &#8212; Final Report' \"praises the work of community-wide strategies\u000a        to promote improved communication skills for all children such as\u000a        Sheffield's `Every Sheffield Child Articulate and Literate by 11' and\u000a        the Stoke Speaks Out early years campaign [based on the original\u000a      work in Sheffield by Ann Locke] that has reduced the percentage of 3-4\u000a        year olds with delayed language from 64% in 2004 to 39% in 2010\".\u000a      ESCAL also received a Communication Strategy Award in 2011as part of the\u000a      Communication Trust's national `Shine a Light Awards'.\u000a    In 2010 the reach of this work was extended to include children from\u000a      Roma, Gypsy and Traveller backgrounds, their teachers and their parents.\u000a      In 2011 an early career knowledge transfer grant (&#163;38k) awarded to Fricke\u000a      allowed HCS research staff to work in collaboration with the Ethnic\u000a      Minority and Traveller Achievement Services (EMTAS) of Sheffield City\u000a      Council (now covered by Targeted Intervention Services for Children and\u000a      Young People) [S4]. Teaching assistants have been trained to\u000a      develop the vocabulary and language skills of 96 children, attending 12\u000a      nurseries or children's centres in Sheffield. These children had performed\u000a      poorly on language screening measures. As a result, there was a\u000a      significant improvement in the children's confidence, attention and\u000a      vocabulary development [S5]. Furthermore, the Teaching Assistants\u000a      (TA) increased their own knowledge and skills and were more aware of how\u000a      children learn language and how to improve their own communication skills\u000a      when working with them: \"A fantastic programme\"; \"I would like\u000a        to continue working with EAL children and have asked for further\u000a        training at work\". One parent of an EAL child spontaneously\u000a      commented: \"I can see a big improvement in his ability naming things,\u000a        counting and speaking English. So big thanks for supporting my child\".\u000a      When EMTAS nominated a Teaching Assistant from this project to present at\u000a      an EAL Champion Event in Sheffield, she concluded by saying `I'm\u000a        totally behind this product!'\u000a    The Tall Ship project is maintained in both nurseries and primary schools\u000a      in Sheffield in collaboration with the LY and is integrated into student\u000a      training placements. In 2012 support was extended to include adolescent\u000a      pupils at a secondary school in the same disadvantaged area of Sheffield [S6].\u000a      This support builds directly on our research (reference 3 above) by\u000a      developing pupils' understanding of specific curriculum vocabulary in\u000a      order to enhance access to the curriculum. Our intervention not only\u000a      improved pupils' comprehension of curriculum words (\"I learned words\u000a        like discriminate &#8212; I didn't have a clue, now I do\"; \"I learned\u000a        loads - interpret, or sustain, ... I heard of them but\u000a        never really understood what it meant ...\"), but also had a wider\u000a      impact: \"I learned not to swear, and not to bully\"; \"I'm more\u000a        confident speaking to different people\".\u000a    The experience of developing a range of school-based programmes has\u000a      enabled HCS researchers to support practitioners to evaluate their own\u000a      programmes. Through publication in key practitioner- focused journals, and\u000a      training days \/forums, HCS staff have increased the number of\u000a      practitioners trained to do this. For example, we organised two national\u000a      conferences specifically on `Evaluating Intervention and Service Provision\u000a      in Schools' (200 participants) and four papers on this topic were\u000a      published by HCS researchers in a special issue of Child Language\u000a        Teaching and Therapy in 2011. Further, an article on how to evaluate\u000a      a multidisciplinary training programme (Wright, Stackhouse and Wood) was\u000a      the most downloaded article published by that journal in 2010-11.\u000a    HCS's expertise in this area has led to our researchers working with the\u000a      charity ICAN to evaluate its own programmes, which are designed to support\u000a      the development of speech and language skills in all children, including\u000a      those children with impoverished language Through competitive tender and\u000a      then by invitation, HCS staff were chosen to evaluate two of ICAN's\u000a      national training and support packages. ICAN reports on its website the\u000a      impact of these programmes with reference to our evaluations. For Primary\u000a        Talk, the work was carried out in primary schools in Bradford. With\u000a      reference to Secondary Talk, ICAN report:\"...Secondary Talk was\u000a        piloted in 14 secondary schools nationwide, rigorously evaluated by\u000a        Sheffield University and has been shown to improve both behaviour and\u000a        engagement in learning.\" [S1]\u000a    The work begun at Sheffield by Anne Locke on social disadvantage and\u000a      language continues to be cited in key documents such as in the Save\u000a        the Children Report on Early Language Delays in the UK (2013), and\u000a      the All Party Parliamentary Group Report on the link between\u000a      speech and language difficulties and social disadvantage (2013). Thus, HCS\u000a      staff have had an impact on policy makers and children's charities, as\u000a      well as on school staff, pupils and families.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Children from areas of socio-economic disadvantage are at risk of\u000a      underachievement at school because of impoverished language and literacy\u000a      development.

Teachers from local schools in areas of social\u000a      disadvantage believed that their pupils had impoverished oral language and\u000a      were unable to take advantage of literacy instruction. In 1998 Locke\u000a      tested this hypothesis by undertaking one of the first longitudinal\u000a      studies of its kind in the UK. Collaborating with the local education\u000a      authority, she tested the language and cognitive development of 240\u000a      monolingual English children attending nurseries in a socially\u000a      disadvantaged area of Sheffield. The teachers' views were confirmed: the\u000a      children's non-verbal cognitive abilities were comparable to the general\u000a      population, but over half of them had moderate to severe language delay\u000a      [R1]. Following up these children through primary [R2] and secondary\u000a      school, HCS researchers found that language and literacy delays persisted,\u000a      particularly in vocabulary, and that primary pupils in 2006-7 performed\u000a      significantly less well than the national average on assessments of\u000a      English and literacy.\u000a    This research has been extended to examine the persisting impact of\u000a      social disadvantage on language, communication and literacy from early\u000a      childhood through to adolescence and young adulthood. In 2008-10, we\u000a      compared teenagers' achievements, attitudes and beliefs in two schools in\u000a      Sheffield. The pupils in a socially disadvantaged part of Sheffield were\u000a      less likely to fulfil their academic potential and to access language and\u000a      literacy learning opportunities compared to pupils in a more affluent\u000a      area. The disadvantaged pupils were aware of differences in language use\u000a      between themselves and other teenagers, and between their own use of\u000a      vocabulary and that of their teachers, whom they often found difficult to\u000a      understand [R3]. A further study of the language, literacy, self esteem,\u000a      and behaviour of socially disadvantaged teenagers excluded from their\u000a      mainstream school revealed that they had previously unidentified language\u000a      and literacy difficulties and needed specific support [R4]. A current\u000a      study in collaboration with the Sheffield Youth Offending Service builds\u000a      on this by investigating the functional language, communication and\u000a      literacy skills of 51 young offenders (YOs) (age range 13-18 years) on\u000a      court orders. As yet unpublished results show that the YOs, who on average\u000a      have missed around 2.5 years of schooling, have performed poorly on\u000a      standardised language and literacy measures, 75% of them scoring at least\u000a      two standard deviations below the mean on two or more tests.\u000a    Collaboration between HCS and ICAN, a national charity for children with\u000a      communication impairments, led to an ESRC Case Studentship (awarded to\u000a      Stackhouse and Clegg) for a unique follow-up study of disadvantaged adults\u000a      who had attended an ICAN residential school for children with\u000a      communication impairments .The study examined speech, language and\u000a      literacy trajectories and highlighted the risk of unemployment and mental\u000a      health difficulties. It also detailed the effects on the parents and\u000a      siblings of having a child with communication difficulties in the family\u000a      [R5]. Our experience of applied research has allowed us to identify the\u000a      process and challenges of evaluating school based programmes [R6]. Funding\u000a      from the University (Early Careers; PhD awards), charities (ICAN), and\u000a      local services (The Learning Year; Youth Offending Service ) has allowed\u000a      us not only to carry out rigorous intervention projects ourselves but also\u000a      to research how to evaluate intervention programmes in schools (see\u000a      section 4)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13966","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Through public lectures, consultancy and collaborations with York Art\u000d\u000a      Gallery and Yorkshire Museum Gardens, Hardie's research has led to\u000d\u000a      enhanced public understanding of Chinese attitudes to gardens and the\u000d\u000a      complex religious and philosophical symbolism that is fundamental to their\u000d\u000a      gardening practice.

This activity has also\u000d\u000a      led to significant collaborations.\u000d\u000a    ii. Consultancy and collaborations leading to enhanced public\u000d\u000a        understanding\u000d\u000a    In 2010, Hardie was invited by the York Museums Trust (YMT) to deliver a\u000d\u000a      public talk and act as consultant for the creation of a `Chinese Garden\u000d\u000a      Trail', in order to extend and complement the British Museum touring\u000d\u000a      exhibition `China &#8212; Journey to the East' at York Art Gallery. The talk was\u000d\u000a      well attended and reported in the York Gallery Newsletter: `a\u000d\u000a      fascinating illustrated summer evening lecture to a sizeable audience' [B],\u000d\u000a      and the planning of the Chinese Garden was incorporated into the Museum\u000a        Gardens Plan: A Garden for York 2010-2015. [C]\u000d\u000a    The Chinese Garden Trail consisted of a series of placards to be\u000d\u000a      displayed in the Museum Gardens, adjacent to the Gallery, highlighting\u000d\u000a      Chinese plants: `The gardens are used by many thousands of people every\u000d\u000a      day. (...) We wanted interesting delightful facts and insights that\u000d\u000a      illuminated the overall role that gardens play in Chinese society.' [D]\u000d\u000a      Hardie advised on the choice of plants and wrote the text for all the\u000d\u000a      information placards and trail leaflet.\u000d\u000a    The placards, on display from June to October 2010 and giving the English\u000d\u000a      and Chinese names of the plants and information on their significance in\u000d\u000a      Chinese culture, were seen by over 800,000 visitors to the Gardens [E],\u000d\u000a      who either in part or in its entirety followed the Chinese garden plants\u000d\u000a      trail guided by the leaflet (F: print run: 10,000+ and distributed\u000d\u000a      to tourist information centres, hotels, guest houses and city\u000d\u000a      attractions,[D]) giving the visitors to the Garden some\u000d\u000a      understanding of the cultural significance of Chinese garden plants, and\u000d\u000a      making them aware of the importance of plants from China in British\u000d\u000a      horticulture.\u000d\u000a    The success of the Chinese Garden Trail led to further changes: `The\u000d\u000a      China Garden trail was so successful that we thought it would be good to\u000d\u000a      have a permanent one' [G]. Hardie was consulted on how to design\u000d\u000a      the garden in such a way that would attract visitors of all ages and\u000d\u000a      encourage activity and interaction, especially with young people, [to] get\u000d\u000a      them involved and doing something in the garden. York Museums Trust\u000d\u000a      decided to install a permanent Chinese-inspired garden area, with\u000d\u000a      permanent placards, and also to include an activity for families.` [C]\u000d\u000a      At Hardie's suggestion this included a `meander' or qushui, a\u000d\u000a      watercourse found in traditional Chinese gardens (a feature that evolved\u000d\u000a      from a 4th century Chinese pastime involving the floating of\u000d\u000a      wine-cups down the stream whilst participants composed poetry) [E].\u000d\u000a      Her recommendation of specific plants was also incorporated into YMT's\u000d\u000a      plans for this Chinese-inspired garden, leading to the expansion of this\u000d\u000a      area of the garden and informed changes to its content [H].\u000d\u000a    iii. Consultancy and collaborations leading to changes in professional\u000d\u000a        practice\u000d\u000a    Thanks to Hardie's work, YMT had for the first time experimented with\u000d\u000a      high quality, focused interpretation in the Gardens. [J]\u000d\u000a    `Dr Hardie's knowledge shared with the Head Gardener and garden guides\u000d\u000a      has added to their own professional knowledge and helped them give\u000d\u000a      visitors more information on the plants in the gardens by drawing\u000d\u000a      attention to the impact of Chinese garden design on UK gardening and the\u000d\u000a      significance of certain trees and shrubs in Chinese gardening. Dr Hardie's\u000d\u000a      advice also changed YMT's original plans for an Oriental Border by\u000d\u000a      highlighting plants that must be included. As a result this area of the\u000d\u000a      garden became larger than originally planned and significantly changed in\u000d\u000a      content.' [J]\u000d\u000a    `It is fair to say that much of the success of these projects has been\u000d\u000a      down to the knowledge of and help from the university. Without expert\u000d\u000a      knowledge, the trail would never have happened, the garden interpretation\u000d\u000a      has hugely benefitted and the idea for the meander would never have\u000d\u000a      crossed our minds.' [D]\u000d\u000a    The impact has therefore been to increase public use and enjoyment of the\u000d\u000a      Yorkshire Museum Gardens, thus contributing to quality of life and health,\u000d\u000a      while providing cultural benefits though public awareness and\u000d\u000a      understanding of Chinese garden history and culture.

Research\u000d\u000a      carried out since she came to Leeds in 2006 as Lecturer, then Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer (2008), in Chinese Studies has focused on the social uses of\u000d\u000a      gardens in the Chinese cultural tradition, particularly for\u000d\u000a      self-representation. Through her critical analysis of regional\u000d\u000a      characteristics, gendered elements, religious and philosophical symbolism,\u000d\u000a      Hardie identified a significant shift in garden aesthetics at the\u000d\u000a      beginning of the 17th century, which she attributed to the\u000d\u000a      spread of new philosophical ideas that also affected developments in\u000d\u000a      literary expression and landscape painting at the time (Output 1).\u000d\u000a    Hardie has demonstrated how certain aesthetic modes have been employed to\u000d\u000a      position the garden owner in relation to socio-political and artistic\u000d\u000a      affiliations. In a number of publications, she has shed important light on\u000d\u000a      the use of garden culture for self-representation by both elite women and\u000d\u000a      courtesans in the late Ming dynasty period (late 16th &#8212; early\u000d\u000a      17th centuries) (2), as well as the employment of\u000d\u000a      regional styles and references in garden design to indicate regional\u000d\u000a      loyalties (3, 4). One study provides a unique interpretation of the\u000d\u000a      regional, philosophical and religious symbolism of a particular 17th\u000d\u000a      century garden in relation to its owner's self-representation, thus\u000d\u000a      revealing its socio-historical significance (4). Key themes of the\u000d\u000a      research, which inform Hardie's public lectures and underpin her\u000d\u000a      collaborations with museum professionals, include the symbolism of plants\u000d\u000a      and other garden features (4), regional and temporal variations in\u000d\u000a      garden style (1, 3), and the use of gardens for self-representation\u000d\u000a      (2, 3, 4).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14373","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As a direct result of Thompson's research on Bloch, Marxism and the\u000d\u000a      Frankfurt School, he has become a regular media commentator on religious\u000d\u000a      affairs from an atheist perspective. This started in 2007 with a `Face to\u000d\u000a      faith' column in The Guardian and then led to Thompson being\u000d\u000a      commissioned to write an ongoing series of columns in that paper from\u000d\u000a      2009, with some 34 columns by July 2013 [S1]. These include two specialist\u000d\u000a      8-column series, the first on `Karl Marx' (2011), and the second on `The\u000d\u000a      Frankfurt School' (2013). Following his initial Guardian\u000d\u000a      contributions, Thompson was also invited to write a long article (3,000\u000d\u000a      words) for the Church Times which was published on Christmas Day\u000d\u000a      2010. These national press contributions have significantly heightened\u000d\u000a      public engagement with atheism [S5], as is evidenced by the c.10,000\u000d\u000a      comments on Thompson's columns. To date, Thompson's Guardian\u000d\u000a      columns [S1] have been read by at least 75,000 individual users; given the\u000d\u000a      extent of the readership, it is difficult to define the exact type of\u000d\u000a      beneficiary of Thompson's work on atheism, but they include international\u000d\u000a      audiences [S6], with a particularly active US and Spanish cohort of\u000d\u000a      readers contributing to the comments section. The international reach is\u000d\u000a      also evidenced by the translation of Thompson's Marx series into Turkish\u000d\u000a      [S2], and the republication of the columns on a Basque blogsite [S3], for\u000d\u000a      example. Thompson's work has reached all age ranges from students to\u000d\u000a      retired school-teachers, many of whom have sent personal emails to\u000d\u000a      Thompson, who responds both to private emails and to reader comments on\u000d\u000a      the Guardian online forums, thereby actively engaging in public\u000d\u000a      debate.\u000d\u000a    The major impact thus generated from Thompson's research has been on\u000d\u000a      public debate about the nature of the relationship between atheism and\u000d\u000a      religion from a Blochian standpoint which goes beyond the sterility of\u000d\u000a      \"New Atheism\" and takes full cogniscence of the importance of religious\u000d\u000a      belief as a part of the human condition rather than seeing it as a\u000d\u000a      delusion. This means that for an atheist like Bloch, taking religion\u000d\u000a      seriously can more easily change public opinion on the topic of atheism.\u000d\u000a      This is done via a range of modes of public and media engagement, both in\u000d\u000a      print and online journalism and through podcasts\/publications of public\u000d\u000a      talks and national radio broadcasts.\u000d\u000a    From public talks to online journalism\u000d\u000a    For example in August 2009, Thompson was invited to contribute to a\u000d\u000a      non-academic public art conference in Amsterdam, to discuss the role of\u000d\u000a      Bloch's concept of a \"concrete utopia\" in artistic and cultural urbanism.\u000d\u000a      The audience of 250 for this event was made up largely of city planners\u000d\u000a      and cultural workers and Thompson's talk has been published subsequently\u000d\u000a      in Jeanne van Heeswijk's artbook The Blue House (2013) [S4].\u000d\u000a      Similarly, in November 2009, and issuing from the Verso introduction [R2],\u000d\u000a      Thompson was invited to give a paper on Bloch, Brecht and Benjamin at the\u000d\u000a      public launch of the book Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brecht: Story of\u000d\u000a        a Friendship by Erdmut Wizisla, the director of the Brecht and\u000d\u000a      Benjamin archives in Berlin, at Birkbeck University of London\u000d\u000a      (subsequently podcast online via Backdoor Broadcasting). The informal\u000d\u000a      public response to this subsequently led Thompson to publish again on\u000d\u000a      Benjamin, this time in relation to Bloch, in his 2013 Guardian\u000d\u000a      column on the Frankfurt School. A reader comment from 29 April 2013 states\u000d\u000a      that: \"I have learned a lot from this series [...]. The most important\u000d\u000a        thing for me has been reading Benjamin and Bloch. [...]. Bloch opened up\u000d\u000a        a really new line of approach to Marxist analysis\", demonstrating\u000d\u000a      how Thompson's research and impact activities have informed the public\u000d\u000a      about a key avenue of philosophical thought which influences their\u000d\u000a      outlook.\u000d\u000a    From online journalism to national radio broadcast\u000d\u000a    Similarly, on the basis of Thompson's work on atheism, Marx, faith and\u000d\u000a      authority in The Guardian, the BBC commissioned a 45-min Sunday\u000d\u000a      feature for Radio 3 on the first German atheist playwright, Georg B&#252;chner,\u000d\u000a      which was broadcast in February and August 2011. Thompson wrote and\u000d\u000a      presented the documentary, for which the listening figure was 100,000 on\u000d\u000a      each occasion, demonstrating how Thompson's research has fed into a wider\u000d\u000a      public debate about the cultural outputs which emerged from this\u000d\u000a      philosophical school of thought [S7]. The invitation by the BBC to write\u000d\u000a      the B&#252;chner documentary happened alongside the invitation from The\u000d\u000a        Guardian to write the Marx column series in 2011; a similar link-up\u000d\u000a      with the BBC for a radio series based on the Frankfurt School columns is\u000d\u000a      also underway.\u000d\u000a    Specifically, it is as a result of Thompson's interventions that Bloch is\u000d\u000a      once again being recognised by scholars, independent philosophers and\u000d\u000a      members of the public alike, as a thinker who has much to contribute to\u000d\u000a      the debate on atheism and religion in the modern world [S8]. For example,\u000d\u000a      an anonymous comment from a member of the public on Thompson's Guardian\u000d\u000a      column stated the following: \"I wonder if the attraction of this\u000d\u000a        extraordinary philosophy [of the Frankfurt School] has anything to do\u000d\u000a        with the collapse of religious faith. [...] I have long wanted to study\u000d\u000a        the theories and motivations of the Frankfurt school. [...] This has\u000d\u000a        been a good introduction.\" [S1] (25 March 2013).\u000d\u000a    Besides his work derived specifically from Blochian thought, Thompson has\u000d\u000a      also written more broadly on commemorations of the war for The\u000d\u000a        Guardian (e.g. for Remembrance Sunday 2012) and in November 2012 he\u000d\u000a      also took part as a speaker in a Sheffield Salon event on the Second World\u000d\u000a      War attended by over 70 members of the public. As is evidenced, Thompson's\u000d\u000a      impact activities thus range from one-off events, to long-term\u000d\u000a      collaborations (e.g. with The Guardian), and have become an\u000d\u000a      integral part of Thompson's research cycle since at least 2007.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research undertaken by Dr Peter Thompson at the University of Sheffield\u000d\u000a      into the role of religion in society, and specifically focusing on\u000d\u000a      atheism, Marxism, Ernst Bloch and the Frankfurt School, has led to new\u000d\u000a      public interest in an atheist philosophy which goes beyond the \"new\u000d\u000a      atheist\" paradigm. The work has attracted national media interest, and as\u000d\u000a      a result of this, Thompson has become a regular contributor for The\u000d\u000a        Guardian, with 34 columns in the `Comment is Free' section on\u000d\u000a      religious and philosophical matters, all derived directly from his recent\u000d\u000a      research into atheism, attracting 9-10,000 comments which have been read\u000d\u000a      by at least 75,000 individuals. Indicative of Thompson's work are comments\u000d\u000a      such as \"Thank-you [...] for introducing an ordinary, non-academic\u000d\u000a        person like myself, to interesting concepts like 'reification' [...]. I\u000d\u000a        will have to read your whole series of articles now.

Developing his research on Bloch and religion has also led to\u000d\u000a      Thompson co-editing a book with Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek, whose role as a public\u000d\u000a      intellectual further strengthens the reach of Thompson's own research.\u000d\u000a      Related to this work are further articles by Thompson in the Church\u000d\u000a        Times, and a BBC Radio 3 documentary on atheist playwright Georg\u000d\u000a      B&#252;chner written and presented by Thompson (listening figure 100,000).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Sheffield\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sheffield (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sheffield","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007157}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2759794","Name":"Amsterdam"},{"GeoNamesId":"2950159","Name":"Berlin"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aR1.

His research on east German\u000d\u000a      opposition to the ruling Communist Party [R3] eventually combined with his\u000d\u000a      long-standing interest in the history of ideas [R6] and the philosophy of\u000d\u000a      religion led him to start working on the impact of the German Marxist\u000d\u000a      philosopher of religion, Ernst Bloch [R1, R2, R4, R5]. Thompson's key\u000d\u000a      research findings to date include new insights into the role of atheism in\u000d\u000a      the modern world. His research led him to work across disciplinary\u000d\u000a      boundaries with scholars in divinity and theology at the University of\u000d\u000a      Oxford, including the Very Revd Dr Jane Shaw who then invited Thompson to\u000d\u000a      contribute to The Guardian, initially via a Face-to-Faith column\u000d\u000a      in 2007, which led to further commissions. This sparked a cycle of\u000d\u000a      research and public engagement, which included Thompson's decision to\u000d\u000a      establish the Centre for Ernst Bloch Studies at the University of\u000d\u000a      Sheffield in 2007, which has become the leading centre outside Germany and\u000d\u000a      attracts enquiries for information and requests for collaboration on Bloch\u000d\u000a      studies from all parts of the world.\u000d\u000a    To consolidate his research in these areas, Thompson was awarded a\u000d\u000a      three-year &#163;86,000 British Academy Research Development Award (BARDA) in\u000d\u000a      2008 on `Ernst Bloch and the Return of Religion' which enabled him to\u000d\u000a      build up substantial international contacts in modern German philosophy\u000d\u000a      and Bloch studies. Since 2008, Thompson has given 20 academic papers on\u000d\u000a      Ernst Bloch and related matters in Britain, Germany and the United States,\u000d\u000a      and published 18 book chapters and articles in top-rated British, German\u000d\u000a      and US publications. Thompson also provided an 11,000-word introduction to\u000d\u000a      Ernst Bloch's Atheism in Christianity, a republication in 2009 by\u000d\u000a      Verso (NY and London) of a 1974 translation of Atheismus im\u000d\u000a        Christentum [R2]. Under the auspices of the BARDA grant, Thompson\u000d\u000a      organised two workshop\/conferences in Sheffield in 2009 and 2010 related\u000d\u000a      to Ernst Bloch and religion, which led to a collaborative book project\u000d\u000a      with Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek [R1]. Several of the authors included gave papers at\u000d\u000a      these conferences. This book contains 13 chapters by international Bloch\u000d\u000a      experts and includes an introduction and a further chapter by Thompson as\u000d\u000a      well as a foreword by &#381;i&#382;ek. &#381;i&#382;ek was previously largely unaware of the\u000d\u000a      significance of Bloch's work until his encounter with Thompson's research,\u000d\u000a      writing in the foreword that: \"[Bloch] is one of the rare figures\u000d\u000a        apropos of which we can say: fundamentally, with regard to what really\u000d\u000a        matters, he was right, he remains our contemporary, he maybe belongs\u000d\u000a        even more to our time than to his own.\"\u000d\u000a    More broadly, Thompson's research on the Frankfurt School, and\u000d\u000a      specifically on Marx and Marxist philosophy [R6], has led to the\u000d\u000a      publication of a series of eight articles for The Guardian in 2011\u000d\u000a      framed under the question `Does Marx Still Matter?', subsequently\u000d\u000a      republished as a discrete publication as a Guardian Short Kindle\u000d\u000a      Book in 2013.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14374","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Three principal impacts arise from Ainsworth's original research:\u000d\u000a    Commercial impact: creation of an SME\u000d\u000a    Scriptura Ltd was launched by the photographic work carried out at\u000d\u000a      Besan&#231;on for the Leverhulme project.

The first is\u000a      influencing government policy through lobbying work to put pressure on\u000a      international governments; the second is more directly public-facing work\u000a      which informs public understanding and raises awareness of human rights\u000a      issues.\u000a    Changes to legislation through media pressure and influence on UK\u000a        policymakers\u000a    Since 2009 Watt has worked with PBI, following an invitation to\u000a      collaborate on Mexican human rights issues. PBI coordinates the efforts of\u000a      academics (such as Watt), journalists, and international lawyers in order\u000a      to raise the profile of their projects in Mexico. Almost all the HRDs with\u000a      whom Watt has worked (via collaboration with PBI) live under the shadow of\u000a      numerous death threats. International attention exposing these concerns is\u000a      of key importance to these individuals simply because it exposes those who\u000a      commit human rights abuses, in turn pressuring the Mexican government to\u000a      address repeated violations of the UN Declaration. PBI's work with Mexican\u000a      HRDs in bringing legal cases before the Inter-American Court of Human\u000a      Rights (IACHR) has led to several landmark and unprecedented rulings, in\u000a      which the Mexican government was sentenced by the Court to pay reparations\u000a      to victims of human rights abuses and to investigate proven human rights\u000a      abuses by the Mexican military. Watt's contribution to this campaign led\u000a      directly to the international tide of condemnation and political pressure\u000a      about the grave human rights situation in Mexico.\u000a    For example, Watt put direct pressure on the Mexican government via an\u000a      open letter to the then Mexican president Felipe Calder&#243;n in November\u000a      2010, published in the Mexican daily national newspaper La Jornada,\u000a      and taken up more widely through republication online in English\u000a      translation. The open letter admonished the Mexican government for failing\u000a      to follow the ruling of the IACHR to investigate the case of Rosendo\u000a      Radilla, who disappeared after being detained in a military road block in\u000a      Atoyac de Alvarez, Guerrero, in August 1974.\u000a    Similarly, as part of a coordinated effort by academics, journalists and\u000a      international lawyers to put pressure on the Mexican government to improve\u000a      its human rights practices, in early 2011 Watt interviewed Valentina\u000a      Cant&#250;, a Mexican indigenous woman who was raped by soldiers, and who\u000a      successfully took her fight for justice all the way to the IACHR. However,\u000a      the Mexican government did not comply with the IACHR judgement, which led\u000a      to PBI asking Watt to contribute to the tide of international media and\u000a      political pressure to raise awareness of the case. Watt's interview with\u000a      Valentina not only fed into his research publications but also into other\u000a      key strands of activity which raised the international profile of the\u000a      case: (1) Valentina's plight was foregrounded on BBC Radio 4 on 10\/02\/11,\u000a      when the actress Julie Christie led a national radio appeal which raised\u000a      &#163;6k for Valentina's cause; (2) Alongside representatives from PBI and\u000a      Amnesty International, Watt accompanied Valentina to the House of Commons\u000a      in June 2011 to meet the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Mexico,\u000a      the APPG on Latin America, a number of MPs and junior ministers in order\u000a      to raise official awareness about the human rights situation in Mexico.\u000a      Valentina was afforded the opportunity to tell her personal story, and\u000a      Watt then briefed ministers on the Mexican context. As a direct result of\u000a      this briefing, questions about Mexico's obligation to abide by\u000a      international human rights treaties (and the UK's official relationship\u000a      with the country) were subsequently raised in parliament by Jeremy Corbyn,\u000a      MP (Chair of the APPG on Mexico) [S4]. Watt also accompanied Valentina to\u000a      meet the Shadow Minister for Borders and Immigration Chris Bryant to ask\u000a      him to write to the Mexican Ambassador in the UK to put further pressure\u000a      on the Mexican government (Bryant agreed).\u000a    Later in 2011, Watt briefed the Foreign and Commonwealth Minister, Jeremy\u000a      Browne, at the House of Commons ahead of his official visit to Mexico,\u000a      highlighting the situation of human rights abuses.\u000a    This combined, concerted effort &#8212; coordinating academic pressure (Watt),\u000a      media pressure (BBC Radio 4, La Jornada), and political pressure\u000a      (MPs and ambassadors) &#8212; had a direct impact on cases brought by Mexican\u000a      HRDs, such as that of Valentina, Rosendo Radilla and Tita Radilla, because\u000a      these cases were instrumental in forcing the Mexican President Calder&#243;n to\u000a      subsequently raise the issue of impunity for human rights abuses allegedly\u000a      committed by the military in the Mexican Senate in 2012. This significant\u000a      change in public opinion regarding human rights issues subsequently led to\u000a      the Mexican Supreme Court ordering the military in August 2012 to abandon\u000a      the uniform impunity guaranteed to military personnel who commit human\u000a      rights abuses. Military personnel allegedly involved in perpetrating human\u000a      rights abuses are now to be tried in a civilian, rather than military,\u000a      court.\u000a    Influencing public perceptions through talks and media interviews\u000a    Linked to his behind-the-scenes work which resulted in IACHR judgements\u000a      and change in Mexican government policies, Watt has also undertaken direct\u000a      public-facing activities. For example, related to his lobbying work, in\u000a      May 2010 La Jornada published a front-page interview with Watt\u000a      about the troubling relationship between human rights abuses and the war\u000a      on drugs. This interview saw Watt beginning to reveal how the pretext of\u000a      the war on drugs was leading to use of sexual violence within a climate of\u000a      (military) impunity. Related to this, in June 2011 Watt spoke at the\u000a      publicly-attended `Mexico and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights'\u000a      Conference at the University of London. Watt spoke on a panel with the\u000a      Mexico director of Amnesty International, a member of the Central America\u000a      and Mexico Team at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and three Mexican\u000a      HRDs (including Valentina Cant&#249;). This public conference took place the\u000a      day before Watt went to the House of Commons to lobby MPs. What emerged\u000a      from this public forum was how the violent contexts experienced by\u000a      Valentina and others were directly related to issues with Mexican\u000a      government policy. Watt made the connection between this eruption of\u000a      violence and human rights abuses and the more wide-reaching war on drugs\u000a      in Mexico.\u000a    Following the publication of his 2012 book on the war on drugs, which has\u000a      generated considerable media interest across the globe, Watt participated\u000a      in a high-profile public event at the Frontline Club in central London to\u000a      discuss the book with a panel of specialists on Mexico. The event was\u000a      chaired by BBC Correspondent Katya Adler and panellists included Watt;\u000a      journalist Ed Vulliamy of The Guardian \/ Observer; the Mexico\u000a      Director of Amnesty International; The Director of the Mexican\u000a        Commission for the Defense of Human Rights; and a prominent Mexican\u000a      HRD and lawyer. The event was filmed and live streamed on Frontline TV. La\u000a        Jornada also covered the event, and it was publicised by the Mexican\u000a      Commission for the Defence of Human Rights based in Mexico City. This\u000a      media coverage served to enhance the international profile of HRDs at\u000a      risk, ultimately contributing to changing perspectives about the grave\u000a      human rights context in Mexico both domestically and in the UK and the US.\u000a      Personal emails to Watt confirm this, such as messages from the leader of\u000a      an online campaign which sought to prevent the former Mexican president\u000a      Calder&#243;n being instated to a post at Harvard in 2012, who recognised the\u000a      importance of Watt's contribution in terms of changing public opinion.\u000a      Watt was also interviewed on his research for the BBC World Service\u000a      programme, The World Today, KBOO radio in Portland Oregon and Sounds\u000a        of Dissent in Boston in July 2012. The BBC's The World Today\u000a      programme is broadcast to 43 million listeners worldwide, 10 million of\u000a      whom listen to the programme in the United States on National Public\u000a      Radio. In July 2012 Watt was also interviewed about the book for the Latin\u000a        America Bureau and the text was subsequently published in the\u000a      organisation's newsletter. In November 2012, Watt was again interviewed\u000a      for a series by the National Geographic History Channel on the subject of\u000a      the book. This six-part series, entitled The '80s: The Decade that\u000a        Made Us is the channel's largest documentary series to date. The\u000a      series was broadcast on April 14-16, 2013, reached a global audience of\u000a      430 million in 171 countries and was translated into 38 languages. In\u000a      December 2012, Watt was interviewed for Al Jazeera's Inside Story\u000a      programme about his research. Whilst precise viewing figures for this\u000a      cannot be obtained, Al Jazeera broadcasts to 220 million homes in 100\u000a      different countries,. Also in December 2012, Watt published a two-part\u000a      interview (about 6000 words) about his book in the Huffington Post.\u000a      The Post's website receives on average 50 million views every\u000a      month and is the third largest news source on the internet after Yahoo and\u000a      CNN. In February and May 2013 Watt conducted two filmed interviews (which\u000a      were aired the following day) for The Real News Network, based in\u000a      Baltimore, on the topic of the book, Drug War Mexico.\u000a    Other media work includes an article authored by Watt in a German\u000a      political magazine, Welt-Sichten in December 2012, and a filmed\u000a      interview based around the book on the history of the Mexican drug war for\u000a      the launching in May 2013 of a new political website based in London, The\u000a        Narcotic Lollipop. It is because HRDs in Mexico repeatedly reiterate\u000a      the central role of the international media in bringing their concerns to\u000a      the attention of a global audience that Watt views this media work as\u000a      central in bringing the unfolding crisis in Mexico to an international\u000a      audience.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research underpins two key areas of public impact. The first relates\u000a      to issues of human rights in Mexico and raising these same concerns at the\u000a      House of Commons with government Ministers and Members of Parliament in\u000a      order to change policies and perspective, and directly advising ministers\u000a      who then raised the issue with their Mexican counterparts, to the benefit\u000a      of victims of human rights abuses in Mexico. The most tangible outcome of\u000a      Watt's contribution to the Mexican Human Rights campaign was the\u000a      presentation of human rights violations before the Inter-American Court of\u000a      Human Rights in Costa Rica (IACoHR) in the case of The United Mexican\u000a      States vs Radilla. The Court made an unprecedented ruling, ordering the\u000a      Mexican state to pay reparations to victims of violations and to\u000a      investigate past abuses. The second aspect of its impact relates to\u000a      dissemination of the research to a global audience via mass media such as\u000a      the BBC World Service, Al Jazeera and The Huffington Post, in order to\u000a      change public perceptions of these pressing human rights issues.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    University of Sheffield\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sheffield (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sheffield","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007157}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3527213","Name":"Estado de Guerrero"},{"GeoNamesId":"5744337","Name":"Oregon"},{"GeoNamesId":"4347778","Name":"Baltimore"},{"GeoNamesId":"3530597","Name":"México"},{"GeoNamesId":"3530597","Name":"Mexico City"},{"GeoNamesId":"4930956","Name":"Boston"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000aR1.

This has been conducted in\u000a      collaboration with other Sheffield-based academics and external bodies,\u000a      including Peace Brigades International (PBI), a human rights organisation\u000a      based in London and with projects in Mexico.\u000a    These collaborations fed directly into Watt's co-authored book Drug\u000a        War Mexico: Politics, Violence and Neoliberalism in the New Narcoeconomy\u000a      (R1), jointly written with Roberto Zepeda, a former PhD student at the\u000a      University of Sheffield and now a lecturer at the Universidad del Mar,\u000a      Mexico. The book argues that the violence associated with organised crime\u000a      in Mexico is in part the consequence of a social and economic breakdown\u000a      exacerbated by the neoliberal economic model adopted since 1982. The\u000a      research sheds light on the human tragedy of the Mexican drug war,\u000a      addressing why over 100,000 people have been killed in Mexico since 2006.\u000a      Both authors were researchers at the University of Sheffield at the time\u000a      of writing the book, and the research began in late 2009 with the final\u000a      manuscript submitted in early 2012.\u000a    Research activities conducted with PBI and their leading Human Rights\u000a      Defenders (HRDs), including interviews with these HRDs, fed into a series\u000a      of peer-reviewed articles (including R3 and R6) prior to the publication\u000a      of the book. The research revealed the extent to which the military units,\u000a      politicians and paramilitary groups responsible for human rights abuses\u000a      rely on secrecy as a means of guaranteeing legal immunity (R1 and R4). It\u000a      also explored the related issues of secrecy in the Mexican media, for\u000a      which Watt uncovered a declassified Mexican government document which\u000a      proposed manipulating public opinion via the media through an \"invisible\u000a      tyranny\", maintaining the facade of democracy while monitoring and\u000a      intervening in media channels (see R6). What began as research exploring\u000a      political repression in the 1970s and its coverage in the media developed\u000a      into a wider project which examined state-backed and organised criminal\u000a      violence in the 1990s and 2000s in the context of increased poverty,\u000a      instability and social vulnerability. The key findings are that the\u000a      current escalation of violence in Mexico is directly linked to the\u000a      neoliberal reforms which developed in the 1980s and particularly since the\u000a      signing of the NAFTA agreement in 1994. R2 and R5 develop this perspective\u000a      which culminates in the book (R1), which is virtually alone in the field\u000a      in demonstrating the complicity of the state and the authorities with\u000a      organised crime, arguing that such arrangements have contributed to a\u000a      devastating erosion of human rights and freedom of expression and\u000a      exacerbated social breakdown and instability.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17640","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The public impact of the exhibition was immense both in Spain and France\u000d\u000a      and was registered by\u000d\u000a      the high attendance figures &#8212; much higher than anticipated &#8212; and by\u000d\u000a      reviewers in virtually the\u000d\u000a      entire spectrum of the Spanish and French press. The exhibition provoked a\u000d\u000a      good deal of\u000d\u000a      discussion both about the relevance of the old masters, in this case\u000d\u000a      Raphael, to modern life; and\u000d\u000a      this was particularly pronounced in the religious press since Raphael is\u000d\u000a      one of the most strongly\u000d\u000a      influential of all painters of Christian themes. The exhibition also\u000d\u000a      attracted the attention of the\u000d\u000a      international press (e.g. The Financial Times (20 Oct 2012), The Wall\u000d\u000a      Street Journal (23 Jun 2012)\u000d\u000a      and the New York Review of Books (13 Jan 2013)) and the professional press\u000d\u000a      (e.g. The Burlington\u000d\u000a      Magazine, Vol. CLIV, Nov 2012, pp. 811-813 and Apollo: D. Ekserdjian,\u000d\u000a      'Raphael Revised', August\u000d\u000a      2012, pp. 109-11).\u000d\u000a    In Madrid the exhibition was accompanied by a two-day conference, held in\u000d\u000a      June 2012, at which\u000d\u000a      papers were given by a group of international scholars; it was attended by\u000d\u000a      a wide public and\u000d\u000a      considerable discussion ensued. Professor Joannides was also asked to a\u000d\u000a      give talk: Afterthoughts\u000d\u000a      on the Late Raphael Exhibition to the National Gallery's research seminar\u000d\u000a      on 28th January, 2013.\u000d\u000a    With the general public, the exhibition was extremely successful: the\u000d\u000a      total number of visitors who\u000d\u000a      saw the exhibition in Madrid between 12 June and 16 September totalled\u000d\u000a      just over 307,095, that is\u000d\u000a      3,031 visitors per day, about 41 % of the daily total of visitors to the\u000d\u000a      Prado. The economic\u000d\u000a      consequences for the Prado are not easy to calculate, because the Museum's\u000d\u000a      policy is not\u000d\u000a      separately to price exhibition-admission but to open exhibitions to all\u000d\u000a      visitors who pay for general\u000d\u000a      entrance. However, the Prado's exhibition service has calculated that 80%\u000d\u000a      of the visitors to Late\u000d\u000a      Raphael came to the Prado specifically to see it; that is about 33% of the\u000d\u000a      daily total of visitors to\u000d\u000a      the Prado as a whole would not have come there had the exhibition not been\u000d\u000a      on. Thus the Prado's\u000d\u000a      income from entrance charges was raised by about 50% during the period of\u000d\u000a      the exhibition. The\u000d\u000a      English and Spanish editions of the catalogue were reprinted during the\u000d\u000a      run in Madrid and\u000d\u000a      according to the Prado, some 9,000 copies were sold, 5,500 from the first\u000d\u000a      printing and 3,500 from\u000d\u000a      the second.\u000d\u000a    The daily attendance at the Louvre during the exhibition's run was rather\u000d\u000a      higher, averaging 4,317,\u000d\u000a      one of the highest on record and exceeding by several hundred visitors per\u000d\u000a      day the numbers\u000d\u000a      reached by the recent exhibition devoted to Leonardo da Vinci's St\u000d\u000a        Anne and surpassing the\u000d\u000a      projected total by 20%.

His standard volume on The Drawings\u000d\u000a      of Raphael of 1983\u000d\u000a      was followed by a pioneering study of Giulio Romano's early paintings in\u000d\u000a      1985 and, subsequently,\u000d\u000a      by several long articles and review articles on the subject of Raphael and\u000d\u000a      his immediate followers,\u000d\u000a      plus numerous shorter studies and entries on individual works in\u000d\u000a      exhibition catalogues (published\u000d\u000a      between 1987 and 2008, with six being published between 1995 and 2008). In\u000d\u000a      these he\u000d\u000a      established much of the conceptual framework of the exhibition and\u000d\u000a      effectively clarified for the first\u000d\u000a      time the chronology of the work of Giulio Romano during Raphael's\u000d\u000a      lifetime, thus helping to\u000d\u000a      elucidate the relation between two artists of the greatest historical\u000d\u000a      importance.\u000d\u000a    The aim of the exhibition was to display all moveable works available for\u000d\u000a      loan and by their\u000d\u000a      arrangement to provide a coherent account of Raphael's&#8212;and his\u000d\u000a      associates'&#8212;work between\u000d\u000a      1513 and 1524, including Raphael's range of pictorial interests and his\u000d\u000a      changes of style over that\u000d\u000a      period. Although some aspects of the later work of Raphael and that of his\u000d\u000a      collaborators had been\u000d\u000a      discussed, the subject had not been treated globally. The exhibitions of\u000d\u000a      the Raphael centenary\u000d\u000a      year of 1983 were nation- or collection- based and loan exhibitions\u000d\u000a      devoted to Raphael since 1983\u000d\u000a      concentrated on his pre-Roman work. All the major monographs on Raphael\u000d\u000a      lose momentum when\u000d\u000a      they arrive at consideration of his later years and his pictorial work has\u000d\u000a      neither been analysed\u000d\u000a      satisfactorily nor set effectively in the context of his vast expansion of\u000d\u000a      other tasks. Chronology,\u000d\u000a      oeuvre-definition and patterns of collaboration have alike remained\u000d\u000a      under-studied.\u000d\u000a    Specific research for the exhibition began in 2008 and involved\u000d\u000a      re-consideration of all the relevant\u000d\u000a      published documentation and much field work in Europe and the United\u000d\u000a      States in studying,\u000d\u000a      examining and checking the works produced by Raphael and his immediate\u000d\u000a      followers within and\u000d\u000a      without the period 1513-1524. The exhibition and its catalogue synthesised\u000d\u000a      existing knowledge and\u000d\u000a      brought this new research to bear on the subject of work by Raphael and\u000d\u000a      his two closest\u000d\u000a      collaborators from 1513 to 1520 and that of those collaborators as they\u000d\u000a      operated independently\u000d\u000a      both before his unexpected death in 1520 and in the years immediately\u000d\u000a      following, up until 1524;\u000d\u000a      this included the presentation and analysis of previously unpublished or\u000d\u000a      little-known paintings and\u000d\u000a      drawings.\u000d\u000a    The writing of the exhibition's catalogue was undertaken during\u000d\u000a      2010-2011.The first version of the\u000d\u000a      introduction and all but three of the catalogue entries were drafted by\u000d\u000a      him. After critical evaluation\u000d\u000a      by Professor Henry, the whole was revised again and finalised by Professor\u000d\u000a      Joannides. Those few\u000d\u000a      catalogue entries that are signed individually were also corrected and\u000d\u000a      revised by both parties. In\u000d\u000a      sum the conceptual structure of the exhibition was fundamentally the\u000d\u000a      responsibility of Professor\u000d\u000a      Joannides but Professor Henry played an important role.\u000d\u000a    Largely at Professors Joannides' and Henry's enthusiastic urging, the\u000d\u000a      Prado, the Louvre and\u000d\u000a      several other museums carried out new scientific examination of the works\u000d\u000a      in their in their care.\u000d\u000a      These examinations, some of whose results were incorporated in the\u000d\u000a      catalogue, were made known\u000d\u000a      at a conference at the Louvre &#8212; October 18-19, 2010 &#8212; in which Joannides\u000d\u000a      and Henry were active\u000d\u000a      participants.

Having accomplished this to a great extent, her research\u000d\u000a      has had two main foci,\u000d\u000a      which together constitute one programme of work on language change and\u000d\u000a      contact.\u000d\u000a    The first element of the research has been continuity [3d,e].\u000d\u000a      Greek has lost the infinitive since the\u000d\u000a      Hellenistic times. Remarkably, Romeyka has preserved, to this day, a\u000d\u000a      robust infinitive usage. By\u000d\u000a      comparing the current infinitival distribution in Romeyka with previous\u000d\u000a      stages of Greek, it was\u000d\u000a      argued that the Romeyka infinitive has its roots in Hellenistic Greek.\u000d\u000a      Proof for this claim derives\u000d\u000a      from the preservation of the construction prin `before' the\u000d\u000a      infinitive which remains extremely\u000d\u000a      productive to this day. Crucially, this construction did not survive into\u000d\u000a      early medieval times and it is\u000d\u000a      only found as a learned construction in `high' registers of the Medieval\u000d\u000a      Greek record. This analysis\u000d\u000a      of the trajectory of the Romeyka infinitive opens up new phylogenetic\u000d\u000a      routes for Asia Minor Greek.\u000d\u000a    The second main element of Dr Sitaridou's research has been the study of\u000d\u000a      discontinuity [3d,e]. It\u000d\u000a      is shown that the Romeyka infinitive has a peculiar distribution which\u000d\u000a      permits it to be licensed in\u000d\u000a      the context of modals, before clauses and counterfactuals. Once\u000d\u000a      Romeyka was cut-off from other\u000d\u000a      medieval varieties (as early as the 12th and as late as the 15th\u000d\u000a      Centuries), the Romeyka infinitive\u000d\u000a      was used in contexts which were linked by antiveridicality. Given that\u000d\u000a      this was what all the\u000d\u000a      contexts had in common, the Romeyka infinitive came to be reanalysed as a\u000d\u000a      negative polarity\u000d\u000a      item, a remarkable transformation. Crucially, the discontinuity that\u000d\u000a      ensued was only possible\u000d\u000a      thanks to the continuity of the before-construction.\u000d\u000a    Whilst Dr Sitaridou studied other areas of the Romeyka grammar [3a,b],\u000d\u000a      her work on the infinitive\u000d\u000a      is the most important because: (i) despite the first descriptions of the\u000d\u000a      Romeyka infinitive in\u000d\u000a      Parharidis (1880), Deffner (1878), Dawkins (1936) and Mackridge (1995,\u000d\u000a      1996), collectively, they\u000d\u000a      did not provide more than a few items of data whilst we now have hundreds\u000d\u000a      of data; (ii) previous\u000d\u000a      works were met with great scepticism since it was claimed that the\u000d\u000a      infinitive was long gone from\u000d\u000a      Pontic Greek (Tombaidis 1977) whilst now we have both irrevocable proof\u000d\u000a      that it has survived and\u000d\u000a      an explanation why the quest for the \"golden infinitive\" has become so\u000d\u000a      ideologised.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17642","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research output has led to improvements of assessment of language\u000a      learning (through language\u000a      test development and validation) and informing of teaching materials.\u000a      Given that the project is set\u000a      up in cooperation with Cambridge Assessment and Cambridge University\u000a      Press, impact is\u000a      worldwide, including students taking exams, teachers preparing the\u000a      students for their exams, and\u000a      more generally, teachers of English. Exam candidature has grown from 2\u000a      million in 2007 to over 4\u000a      million in 2013; something that Cambridge Assessment feel is partly\u000a      attributable to the cooperation\u000a      in the EPP project with researchers in DTAL [1]. Also, accreditation of\u000a      the Cambridge suite of\u000a      exams has been helped as the qualities of the tests can be better\u000a      communicated to agencies such\u000a      as OFQUAL, UKBS and equivalent overseas agencies such as DIAC in Australia\u000a      and CIC in\u000a      Canada based on the research by DTAL.\u000a    Impact of the project can also be measured through the participation in\u000a      the EPP network events\u000a      and the use of the EPP website. Both were set up to promote increased\u000a      engagement of\u000a      stakeholders (governments, teachers, language learners) with the research\u000a      projects. The website\u000a      informs of future and recent network events, has a link to the Cambridge\u000a      Learner Corpus, but also\u000a      provides useful resources for researchers, teachers, testers, ministries\u000a      of education and other\u000a      English Profile network partners. Visits on the website show active\u000a      collaboration with practitioners.\u000a      Resources include, amongst others, the English Vocabulary Profile\u000a      and the Guide to the CEFR for\u000a        English Language Teachers [2]. The former can be used by teachers,\u000a      exam writers, materials\u000a      developers and researchers to identify the words or phrases a learner can\u000a      be expected to know at\u000a      each level; to view words and phrases within a specific topic area; and to\u000a      search for additional\u000a      aspects of language, such as which uncountable nouns learners can be\u000a      expected to know at A1,\u000a      which verbs are frequently used in the passive at B2 and which words are\u000a      used in which registers\u000a      at different levels. The Vocabulary Profile is accompanied by webinars by\u000a      the author (Annette\u000a      Capel). The latter clarifies to teachers how the CEFR can be useful to\u000a      them in terms of seeing what\u000a      learners need to work on to attain a certain level; of creating their own\u000a      assessment grids; and\u000a      working out curriculum plans. The website has been up and running since\u000a      approximately August\u000a      2008 and gets 1500-2000 visits per week. Since January 2010 there have\u000a      been 138,928 unique\u000a      visitors with 33,249 unique visitors since January 1 2013, of whom 70% are\u000a      new and 30% are\u000a      returning visitors. 2028Furthermore, currently 2496 people subscribed to\u000a      the EPP newsletter, and\u000a      11,000 are registered users of English Vocabulary Profile.\u000a    An ever-growing number of government advisors and educationists make up the\u000a    English Profile\u000a    Network. Included in the non-academic collaborators are the\u000a    Bosnia-Herzegovina Ministry of\u000a    Education, Vietnamese National Institute for Educational Strategy, and the\u000a    Bahrain's Bahraini\u000a    Petroleum Company. Regular network meetings are held (twice per year) in\u000a    which stakeholders\u000a    are invited to be updated on the research, and interact with researchers on\u000a    the application of\u000a    results for their specific needs (for example, teaching plans, national\u000a    curricula development,\u000a    assessment and exam planning). Some of the stakeholders also participate as\u000a    data collaborators\u000a    to create a new database, the Cambridge English Profile Corpus. That\u000a    is, schools (mostly\u000a    secondary), language schools and universities provide data for the database.\u000a    The schools are\u000a    spread all over the world (Croatia, Argentina, Austria, the Netherlands,\u000a    France, Russia, Vietnam),\u000a    and have benefits when they participate. For example, they 1) gain on-line\u000a    access to a subset of\u000a    the English Profile Dataset (including the contributor's own data) in an\u000a    accessible and easily\u000a    searchable format. This can help the teachers understand their own students'\u000a    needs better, and to\u000a    develop teaching materials catering for their needs. For example, if they\u000a    have been concentrating\u000a    on the teaching of particular forms, they can measure how successful their\u000a    teaching was (using the\u000a    database), and if they find in the data that some forms are not actually\u000a    acquired, they can adjust\u000a    their teaching program accordingly. Presentations on how to use the database\u000a    in the classroom for\u000a    other purposes (show students examples of words with multiple meanings,\u000a    collocations, etc.) are\u000a    also available. 2) They receive free tickets to English Profile network\u000a    workshops, which will further\u000a    include training relevant to teachers, such as how to rate a student's work\u000a    by CEFR level, and free\u000a    access to the eBook versions of John Trim and Jan van Ek's Council of Europe\u000a    volumes (the T-series:\u000a    Waystage, Threshold and Vantage). 3) Schools finally also\u000a    receive a 'certificate of\u000a    participation', and listing of the school's name, with thanks, on the\u000a    website's corpus\u000a      collection\u000a      participants page, thereby potentially improving \/ strengthening their\u000a    profile.\u000a    Interest from language schools is also evident. EF Education First is one\u000a      of the largest international\u000a      education organisations in the world, with 400 offices and language\u000a      schools, exchange\u000a      programmes, and degree courses in over 50 countries world-wide. They teach\u000a      students and\u000a      professionals. EF Education First has funded a large research project in\u000a      the Research Centre for\u000a      English and Applied Linguistics, now DTAL (launch February 2010) and is\u000a      now using 'big data'\u000a      from a corpus jointly designed by EF Education First and the funded EF\u000a      Research Unit at DTAL to\u000a      further the understanding of criterial features related to CEFR language\u000a      stages of fluency. This\u000a      understanding of course also leads to improved learner directed teaching.\u000a      EF Education First has\u000a      furthermore aligned all their teaching with the CEFR, collaborating with\u000a      framers of the EPP to do\u000a      so. Recently (linked to their 20th anniversary teaching in\u000a      China), it has also started to engage\u000a      press, teachers and parents in issues regarding the best age to teach \/\u000a      learn a second language\u000a      [3, 4, 5, 6], and the best ways to motivate learners. Work within the EF\u000a      Research Unit feeds back\u000a      directly into those issues, and the teaching material and assessment of\u000a      language students' work\u000a      [7].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The EPP Project identifies criterial features for second language\u000a      acquisition.

The Director of the Kiowa Tribe Museum says: `There is a great need\u000d\u000a      for language tools such as booklets, guides, CDs, apps ... the booklets\u000d\u000a      ... will assist us in our fight to preserve and reclaim our language.'\u000d\u000a      (letter 26\/4\/13).\u000d\u000a    The research findings led to an understanding of the recorded stories\u000d\u000a      that allowed the researchers to present them in a way that makes the Kiowa\u000d\u000a      language and Kiowa cultural memory accessible to the younger tribal\u000d\u000a      members whose own control of the language is dysfluent or highly\u000d\u000a      restricted, as well as to Kiowas with a stronger grasp on their language.\u000d\u000a      The booklets are presented in a layout allowing multipurpose usage,\u000d\u000a      combining Kiowa text for fluent speakers, word-by-word glosses for\u000d\u000a      learners, and idiomatic English translations for non-speakers. They are\u000d\u000a      structured in a `flippable' fashion, allowing use of the two most common\u000d\u000a      Kiowa writing systems.\u000d\u000a    The booklets are distributed by key tribal contacts and by agencies of\u000d\u000a      tribal government, culture, media and education, including the Kiowa Tribe\u000d\u000a      Museum, the Kiowa Elders' Center, the Anadarko Daily News (connected to\u000d\u000a      the National Hall of Fame for Famous American Indians) and Jacobson House,\u000d\u000a      a non-profit Native American centre. They are also downloadable from a\u000d\u000a      Facebook group, established in 2012 by the researchers to engage the\u000d\u000a      community in a sustainable fashion\u000d\u000a      (www.facebook.com\/groups\/290180151091518). Harbour gave a talk on how the\u000d\u000a      texts were to be made accessible to Museum and Elders' Center employees\u000d\u000a      and was interviewed about this on Kiowa Voices Radio (4\/13).\u000d\u000a    This work has impacted on four beneficiaries:\u000d\u000a    (1) Elders. The elders (aged over 70) are central to tribal\u000d\u000a      identity as custodians of cultural memory and linguistic knowledge.\u000d\u000a      Individual elders, as well as those responsible for their welfare, report\u000d\u000a      personal and community benefits. The Director of the Kiowa Elders' Center\u000d\u000a      says: `All this work is appreciated by the leadership of the Kiowa tribe\u000d\u000a      as well as by those of us who are working to learn our language', (letter\u000d\u000a      29\/4\/13). An elder says: `You gave me the inspiration to learn my Kiowa\u000d\u000a      language and to teach my half-Kiowa children our language.' (Facebook\u000d\u000a      6\/7\/13).\u000d\u000a    (2) Language classes. Life-long-learning, grass-roots language\u000d\u000a      classes running weekly at Jacobson House, at Chickasha (taught by Dorothy\u000d\u000a      Delaune, over 270 booklets distributed), and at Oklahoma University (Dane\u000d\u000a      Poolaw) now have Listen-Read-Repeat resources, featuring whole stretches\u000d\u000a      of discourse on culturally significant topics. Ms Neely, assisting Mrs\u000d\u000a      Delaune in Chickasha, says: `I love the booklets &#8212; you all did a great\u000d\u000a      job! I'm so glad you're distributing them and getting them out into the\u000d\u000a      community.' (Facebook 17\/3\/13). Mr Poolaw says: `This is great! ... keep\u000d\u000a      it up, this will be very useful ... help[ing] students and learners get to\u000d\u000a      read and hear Kiowa and get used to pronunciation.' (Facebook 15\/02\/13).\u000d\u000a    (3) Self-learners. Grass-roots self-learners benefitted via a\u000d\u000a      online community set up via the Kiowa Stories Facebook group (over 200\u000d\u000a      members including adult learners, organizations and students from local\u000d\u000a      high schools), which distributes electronic materials and YouTube\u000d\u000a      recordings (A Kind Man &#8212; 84 downloads; Captive Woman &#8212; 57,\u000d\u000a      Olden Times &#8212; 30).\u000d\u000a    One member of the group, who lives away from the main Kiowa area, says:\u000d\u000a      `It is very helpful ... being able to hear the audio of the speaker and\u000d\u000a      also reading along with them. I have downloaded the stories booklets to my\u000d\u000a      phone and have also made recordings of the audio ... It is very important\u000d\u000a      to me as a Kiowa to keep this language alive, I have also been helping my\u000d\u000a      family on learning the Kiowa language. The Kiowa Stories Facebook page is\u000d\u000a      also a great room, I know if I have a question on a word or phrase that\u000d\u000a      would be the first place I would check ...' (email 22\/06\/13).\u000d\u000a    (4) Kiowa Tribal Museum. The Museum is a cultural resource and\u000d\u000a      tourist attraction, featuring art, artefacts, and, audio(visual)\u000d\u000a      recordings. Its mission includes preserving and providing access to\u000d\u000a      cultural\/linguistic heritage. The materials produced aid in this, making\u000d\u000a      previously inaccessible cultural heritage available to speakers,\u000d\u000a      non-speakers and learners. The Museum's Director says: `One of the most\u000d\u000a      frequent requests here at the Museum is for language materials. ...\u000d\u000a      Currently, we do not have any language texts (apart from the booklets\u000d\u000a      ...).' The researchers' sustained engagement with the museum, before,\u000d\u000a      during and after the project, has led the museum to act as a hub, hosting\u000d\u000a      sound files and distributing booklets. She continues: `One of our long\u000d\u000a      term goals [is] to create a language center ... the books that you sent\u000d\u000a      will fit in well with that goal.' (email 18\/4\/13).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Researchers working on endangered languages have an obligation to produce\u000d\u000a      work of lasting value to the language community. International\u000d\u000a      collaborative research by QMUL on Kiowa (fewer than 30 fluent speakers)\u000d\u000a      has substantially contributed to preserving and revitalizing this native\u000d\u000a      language of Oklahoma. Tribal elders, grassroots language-class\u000d\u000a      participants, grassroots self- learners and Kiowa cultural institutions\u000d\u000a      have benefitted from new language-learning resources: specially designed\u000d\u000a      booklets and an online community via Facebook and YouTube. Over 200 people\u000d\u000a      are now learning Kiowa using real oral literature rather than made-up\u000d\u000a      sentences. A vast amount of linguistic and cultural knowledge, which would\u000d\u000a      otherwise have been lost with the last fluent generation, is now made\u000d\u000a      accessible to the tribe.

The grant ran from September 2004 to\u000d\u000a      September 2007 and comprised an award of &#163;192,000. Adger was Reader in\u000d\u000a      Linguistics at the time, and was PI on the grant. His co-PI was Laurel\u000d\u000a      Watkins (Colorado College), who is the world expert on Kiowa language.\u000d\u000a      QMUL employed Daniel Harbour full time on the grant as Research Fellow,\u000d\u000a      and subsequently in a 0.25 then 0.5 permanent position. Fieldwork was\u000d\u000a      carried out in Anadarko and Carnegie, Oklahoma. All research was carried\u000d\u000a      out under grant auspices.\u000d\u000a    The primary aim of the research was to investigate how a free word order\u000d\u000a      language like Kiowa uses information about speakers' expectations of each\u000d\u000a      others' knowledge to structure discourse and grammar. Answering this\u000d\u000a      underpinning question required the close collaboration of the last native\u000d\u000a      speakers of the language (about 30 elderly people). The researchers used\u000d\u000a      recordings collected between the 1950s and 1980s, working with fluent\u000d\u000a      tribal elders to understand how grammar and discourse intertwine. This led\u000d\u000a      to a level of detailed knowledge of Kiowa storytelling and language that\u000d\u000a      would otherwise have remained forever inaccessible. They found that not\u000d\u000a      only are concepts like topic and focus encoded by particular syntactic\u000d\u000a      devices, but that specific regions of the Kiowa clause are used to mark\u000d\u000a      important shifts in narrative expression. The research also led to new\u000d\u000a      insights into and knowledge of Kiowa lexis, dialectology, grammar and\u000d\u000a      narrative structure.\u000d\u000a    Moreover, the research helped answer a hard, but fundamental, question\u000d\u000a      about transcribing Kiowa oral literature: people don't speak with\u000d\u000a      punctuation or in paragraphs, so where to insert such breaks is generally\u000d\u000a      a choice that outsiders must make without proper understanding of\u000d\u000a      narrative subtleties and conventions. Results can largely misrepresent\u000d\u000a      native understanding. The research provided original and distinctive\u000d\u000a      insight into how discourse structure is reflected in Kiowa syntax (Adger et\u000a        al, 2009; Harbour et al, 2011) and, therefore, how the texts\u000d\u000a      should be faithfully transcribed.\u000d\u000a    In addition, the researchers established a steering committee of Kiowas\u000d\u000a      (elders and younger tribal members) during the research itself to ensure\u000d\u000a      that the community could engage with our work and the team has sustained\u000d\u000a      its connections with Elders and Kiowa Cultural institutions since the\u000d\u000a      project finished, in order to be able to produce work of lasting value to\u000d\u000a      the tribe.

The\u000a      first phase (2004-07) revealed that, contrary to thinking at the time,\u000a      London is not the source of the language changes underway in many UK urban\u000a      centres. Analysing a transcribed corpus from audio recordings of 1.4\u000a      million words from indigenous Londoners aged 70+ and adolescents aged\u000a      16-19 from many different ethnic groups, the research team found that\u000a      young people in multicultural inner city areas used a repertoire of\u000a      innovative features, in all components of language. The researchers refer\u000a      to this way of speaking as Multicultural London English (MLE) and argue\u000a      that MLE has replaced `Cockney'. Young people from immigrant backgrounds\u000a      led in the use of MLE features, but white speakers from long-standing\u000a      `Cockney' families also used them.\u000a    The second research phase (2007-10) aimed to establish how MLE arose. A\u000a      further 2 million words were recorded and transcribed from speakers aged\u000a      4, 8, 12, 16-19, 25 and 40, including parents and caregivers of 12 of the\u000a      younger children. The researchers found that MLE was well established\u000a      among the youngest children, suggesting that they acquired it from peers\u000a      and siblings, not their parents (who were mostly non-native speakers of\u000a      English). They concluded that children in multilingual areas of London\u000a      acquire combinations of language features from a rich `feature pool' of\u000a      linguistic forms influenced by a wide variety of languages, dialects and\u000a      learner varieties. The pool serves as a resource and a model for\u000a      non-native speakers acquiring English where there is no consistent target\u000a      variety. This is a new dynamic of change affecting a metropolis containing\u000a      a large minority ethnic and\/or immigrant population, with strong\u000a      implications for our understandings of processes of language change. More\u000a      than 40 outputs to date include detailed quantitative analyses of ongoing\u000a      language changes at the phonetic, grammatical and discourse levels,\u000a      accounts of how specific innovations emerge, and new contributions to our\u000a      understanding of the effect of language contact on language change. They\u000a      are published in international peer-reviewed journals, edited volumes and\u000a      include presentations at national and international conferences.\u000a    Although the research had mainly theoretical objectives, the Pathways to\u000a      Impact included 3 Knowledge Exchange workshops with teachers and students\u000a      of GCE A-level English Language, where sound clips from the project\u000a      recordings were discussed (held at St Francis Xavier 6th Form College,\u000a      London SW12, Feb 2009 and July 2009; Hackney Community College, London N1,\u000a      Dec 2007, with approx. 30 participants at each). Teachers asked to use\u000a      these recordings in their classes since few suitable teaching materials on\u000a      spoken English existed. They confessed to lacking confidence in using\u000a      appropriate linguistic frameworks and terminology as they had been trained\u000a      in literature, not linguistics. Furthermore they found it difficult to\u000a      meet the examination boards' requirement to keep abreast of current\u000a      Linguistics research, because of time constraints and the difficulties of\u000a      accessing journals.

The\u000a      involvement of academics as co-founders of and advisers to festivals, is\u000a      supplemented by further contributions as interlocutors, co-curators, and\u000a      mediators to enrich the understanding, knowledge and constitution of\u000a      festival audiences. Through close collaboration with cultural partners,\u000a      the public understanding of film outside of the mainstream and a regional\u000a      history of cinema-going have been significantly extended. A variety of\u000a      approaches have been used to translate scholarship into popular discourse,\u000a      including on-stage interviews of those involved in film production,\u000a      curation of film programmes and participatory memory-based events\u000a      recalling cinema-going in the East End. Through collaborations and the\u000a      adoption of formal roles&#8212;Evans as an advisor to the London Spanish Film\u000a      Festival (LSFF), Toffell as an AHRC Public Engagement Researcher in\u000a      Residence with the East End Film Festival (EEFF)&#8212;along with the College's\u000a      financial support of the LSFF, the relationship between researchers and\u000a      cultural institutions has been defined by a mutual shaping of agendas.\u000a    Evans' work, crossing popular and surrealist Spanish filmmakers of the\u000a      1920-1990s, was formative in `supporting this festival since the\u000a      conception of the very first edition' (Joana Granero, Director LSFF).\u000a      Evans continues to influence the decisions of contemporary and\u000a      retrospective film programming in the festival's eighth year. The LSFF is\u000a      held at the Cin&#233; Lumi&#232;re and Instituto Cervantes, West London, for a\u000a      period of two weeks during July, and assessment data shows that it\u000a      attracts approximately 75% of new audiences each year (Tristana Media). In\u000a      2012, it attracted over 4000 people, its success leading to an extension\u000a      of the festival as `Spring Weekend' events. As a member of the advisory\u000a      group, Evans continues to work with the programming team to determine the\u000a      focus of each festival, to ensure the programming of contemporary and\u000a      archive film, and during the festival, to introduce programmes and conduct\u000a      interviews with key film production personnel. In 2009, Evans' interview\u000a      with Angela Molina sold out a venue of 226 seats, a success that was\u000a      repeated in 2011 when Evans interviewed actress Geraldine Chapman. Evans'\u000a      analysis of Pedro Almodovar was highly influential in planning and\u000a      commissioning a sell-out special series of events examining the acting\u000a      registers developed by the director. Evans' psychoanalytic approach\u000a      connecting acting styles to national culture, has a further dimension\u000a      through his participation in the International Psychoanalytic Film\u000a      Festival, a forum for dialogue between psychoanalysts, filmmakers,\u000a      academics and the public.\u000a    Evans' work paved the way for a second tier of scholarship on film\u000a      festivals and cinema history with particular attention to extending the\u000a      audience for film festival events. The question of how to engage a\u000a      spectrum of generations to festivals, specifically the post-retirement and\u000a      youth audiences, was addressed through the appointment of Dr Gil Toffell\u000a      as a Leverhulme funded postdoctoral fellow (2009-2011). Toffell's research\u000a      on generations of film-goers in the East End was of interest to\u000a      programmers at the EEFF, and during the following two years he worked with\u000a      the East End Film Festival to present the history of East End cinema-going\u000a      in the festival's programme. Securing funding from the London Centre for\u000a      Arts and Cultural Exchange (LCACE), Toffell was invited to create an event\u000a      on the history of Jewish East End cinema-going in summer 2011, `The Sights\u000a      and Sounds of the Jewish East End', involving a screening of a rarely seen\u000a      documentary made in the East End, The Vanishing Street, and a\u000a      presentation of Toffell's research. The playwright and novelist Bernard\u000a      Kops gave the keynote introduction for the sell-out event (venue capacity\u000a      220). The audience was notably local, with some members having appeared in\u000a      the documentary, and for whom this event provided the first opportunity to\u000a      reflect on their involvement. Toffell's ability to unearth and interpret\u000a      cultural heritage led to the issue of an invitation to develop future\u000a      events.\u000a    In 2012, Toffell's engagement with East End film culture was consolidated\u000a      with the EEFF screening of a Yiddish film, A Kid for Two Farthings\u000a      (Reed, 1955), and a workshop for young people exploring film and the East\u000a      End (supported by Queen Mary Public Engagement Fund). In November 2012, an\u000a      AHRC Cultural Engagement Award facilitated further collaboration between\u000a      the EEFF, the London Borough of Tower Hamlets (LBTH), youth community\u000a      organizations (Hi8tus, Mile End Community Project) and Queen Mary\u000a      researchers to develop a semi-autonomous film festival with young people\u000a      in East London. The project brought together Toffell's historical\u000a      knowledge of migration and cinema in East London with contemporary\u000a      diasporic culture to inform film festival decision making, and to help\u000a      young people realise their own cultural aspirations. Toffell, with Harbord\u000a      and Rai, worked with these organizations to recruit and train young people\u000a      outside of HEI to develop the semi-autonomous `Cutting East Youth Film\u000a      Festival'. Cutting East ran from 28-30 June 2013 at Rich Mix cinema,\u000a      attracting 553 people, 60% of whom were aged 19 or younger, and 42% were\u000a      Bangladeshi and non-white minority ethnicities (LBTH monitoring report).\u000a      In developing a new channel of involvement for local youth, the\u000a      collaboration also sensitized the EEFF to local needs. Academic research\u000a      methods aided the focus of the festival, with young people researching the\u000a      views of their diasporic communities about the EEFF in filmed interviews,\u000a      which in turn were screened at the event in July 2013. A further AHRC\u000a      award (an international network grant) has been secured to debate the\u000a      cultural rights of young people in their re-purposing of media,\u000a      interfacing community groups in East London and Mumbai, partnering with\u000a      the EEFF. These recent awards provide for a sustained enhancement of\u000a      public film culture through the collaboration of Queen Mary film\u000a      scholarship and film festivals.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Film Festivals constitute the main institutional alternative to\u000a      commercially-driven cinema and as such occupy a vitally important part of\u000a      our cultural heritage. The BFI estimates that `only 7% of all cinema\u000a      screens are regularly devoted to non-mainstream film', and cites the film\u000a      festival as an exemplary model for broadening cinema knowledge and\u000a      education (`New Horizons for UK Film 2012-17').

The\u000a      research has been developed through extended and in-depth engagement with\u000a      film archives and libraries internationally, and has excavated new\u000a      information concerning the role of actors, directors, scriptwriters,\u000a      financiers and the memory of audiences. From these excavations, new\u000a      interpretive accounts have been written to revise perceptions of films,\u000a      extend audience engagement with cinema in particular periods and\u000a      neighbourhoods, and engage communities with film culture more broadly.\u000a      Researchers in the department have made wide contributions to the field in\u000a      the form of monographs, articles, scholarly editions, edited collections\u000a      and educational notes for exhibition and DVD publication.\u000a    Peter Evans has been at the forefront of psychoanalytical approaches to\u000a      film, tracing an ongoing fascination with sexuality and religion as a\u000a      national unconscious of Spanish cinema, forging links between surrealist\u000a      avant-garde filmmaking and popular film genres. Evans has published widely\u000a      on Spanish cinema, notably The Films of Luis Bu&#241;uel: Subjectivity and\u000a        Desire (1995), combining a history of Bu&#241;uel's exile in Mexico with\u000a      a detailed analysis of his films, a study of a Pedro Almod&#243;var film, and\u000a      an anthology of essays, Spanish Cinema: the Auteurist Tradition\u000a      (1999). A further reconsideration of the career of Bu&#241;uel, the co-edited Luis\u000a        Bu&#241;uel: New Approaches (2004), continues the re-evaluation of\u000a      historical Spanish film. Evans' work has become a key reference in the\u000a      narration of Spanish cinema history; he is cited on Bu&#241;uel's Wikipedia\u000a      page, the journal Senses of Cinema's profile of the director and\u000a      the International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers. In 2012, Evans wrote\u000a      the booklet accompanying the Blue Ray release of Bu&#241;uel's final film, That\u000a        Obscure Object of Desire (1977), and in the same year published a\u000a      study of the cult film, Jam&#243;n jam&#243;n (Bigas Luna), placing another\u000a      filmmaker on this map.\u000a    Scholarship on the history of cinema-going, pioneered by Kuhn in the\u000a      1990s and continued by postdoctoral researcher Gil Toffell, has been at\u000a      the forefront of developments in reception studies. Focusing on the\u000a      immediate neighbourhoods surrounding Queen Mary, Toffell traced the\u000a      ephemeral presence of audiences through archive sources including press\u000a      reports, advertisements, reviews and the history of cinema ownership and\u000a      film distribution. Archives sourced by Toffell include the British Library\u000a      Newspaper Archive, Tower Hamlets Local History Library, People's Palace\u000a      Archive, Manchester Jewish Museum and Edinburgh Film Guild Archive.\u000a      Toffell's work on Yiddish cinema- going between the wars, the first\u000a      scholarly examination of an explicitly Jewish cinema at this time, was\u000a      published in the prestigious peer reviewed journal Screen (2009),\u000a      and further articles have appeared in scholarly journals.\u000a    Key researchers' employment at submitting unit:\u000a    (i) Peter Evans, 1996- 2011 Professor in Film Studies (retired 2011).\u000a    (ii) Annette Kuhn, appointed 2006 (0.2) Professor in Film Studies.\u000a    (iii) Gil Toffell, 2009-11, Leverhulme Postdoctoral Fellow; 2011-13\u000a      fractional posts as Researcher in Residence, and Research Assistant\u000a      (Bazaar Cinema).\u000a    (iv) Janet Harbord, appointed 2010 Professor in Film Studies.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18028","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Contributions to policy debates\u000a    Oakes' Language, Citizenship and Identity [1] is widely\u000a      considered as an important reference point\u000a      for language-policy debates in Quebec.

It relates to questions concerning both the status of the\u000a      languages examined (status\u000a      planning) and the form of language to be promoted (corpus planning), at\u000a      both the macro level (e.g.\u000a      official language planning and policy development) and the micro level\u000a      (e.g. language attitudes\u000a      amongst the general public). A central theme in the research is the idea\u000a      of language planning as a\u000a      form of identity planning.\u000a    Building on broader expertise developed in his book Language and\u000a        Identity: Comparing France\u000a        and Sweden (2001), Oakes' research into Quebec language policy and\u000a      planning examines recent\u000a      official attempts to secure the status of French in Quebec by fostering a\u000a      common civic identity, with\u000a      French as the key element, in an increasingly ethnically diverse\u000a      population. It shows that this `top-down' language policy is often at\u000a      variance with `bottom-up' language policy generated at\u000a      grassroots level. On the one hand, the civic model finds no echo among\u000a      many members of minority\u000a      (especially indigenous) groups; on the other, promotion of an overly civic\u000a      model risks alienating\u000a      Quebecers of French Canadian origin by refusing to recognise officially\u000a      the majority's\u000a      ethnolinguistic identity. Complementing studies in sociology, political\u000a      science and political\u000a      philosophy, the research provides a distinctly macro-sociolinguistic\u000a      contribution to language-policy\u000a      debates in Quebec today. It introduces a frequently lacking comparative\u000a      dimension, analysing\u000a      Quebec's unique situation in the broader context of language and national\u000a      identity in an\u000a      increasingly globalised world and highlighting lessons that can be drawn\u000a      for a more comprehensive\u000a      understanding of language and identity in other contexts worldwide.\u000a      Findings were published in a\u000a      co-authored book [1] and a number of articles (including [2], [3]).\u000a    Complementing Oakes' work, Pfalzgraf's research on German linguistic\u000a      purism and related areas\u000a      focuses on corpus planning. Since Germany has no official\u000a      language-planning agent such as a\u000a      Language Academy or government body, Pfalzgraf examines `bottom-up'\u000a      language policy at the\u000a      micro level in Germany, in the form of self-appointed private language\u000a      protectors that seek to\u000a      combat foreign linguistic influences through active associations. His book\u000a      Neopurismus in\u000a        Deutschland nach der Wende [4] shows that these movements, which\u000a      barely existed and had no\u000a      public influence between the end of World War II and German unification,\u000a      and which often have a\u000a      distinctly anti-American ethos, relate closely both to German unification\u000a      and to developing\u000a      processes of globalisation. Their rise must be understood as expressing a\u000a      widespread and more\u000a      general fear of the loss of cultural identity. In this respect, linguistic\u000a      criticism as practised by self-appointed purists is a form of cultural\u000a      criticism and seeks to protect and foster German identity.\u000a      Research was published in a monograph [4], two edited books (including\u000a      [6]), and six articles\u000a      (including [5]).\u000a    Researchers' employment at Queen Mary:\u000a    Oakes: Lecturer in French 2000-5; Senior Lecturer in French 2005-7;\u000a      Reader in French and\u000a      Linguistics 2007-\u000a    Pfalzgraf: German Language Studies Co-ordinator 2004-7; Lecturer in\u000a      German Linguistics and\u000a      Medieval German 2007-11; Academic Co-ordinator of the Language Centre\u000a      2011-\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18030","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The process\u000d\u000a      Between 7 October and 18 November 2010, the Globe Theatre and the Goethe\u000d\u000a      Institute in London, \"inspired by\", as Madeline Knights of the Globe put\u000d\u000a      it in an e-mail, \"and indebted to\", R&#252;diger G&#246;rner's research into\u000d\u000a      Goethe's relationship with Shakespeare, and more broadly into the German\u000d\u000a      preoccupation with him (4, 5, and 6 above) staged a season of lectures,\u000d\u000a      performances, rehearsed readings and film showings under the overall title\u000d\u000a      `Shakespeare is German'. This season, supported by the German Embassy and\u000d\u000a      the Institute of Germanic &amp; Romance Studies (IGRS), entailed an\u000d\u000a      exemplary collaboration between two of the major cultural institutions in\u000d\u000a      London. It led to Globe Education devoting a whole season to the German\u000d\u000a      Shakespeare, which involved distinguished scholars, actors, translators\u000d\u000a      and directors from both Germany and the UK, and putting on staged readings\u000d\u000a      of other English plays with German connections. At the same time, the\u000d\u000a      Goethe Institute devoted a film season to some of the less obvious, but\u000d\u000a      historically important, film adaptations of Shakespeare plays.\u000d\u000a    Preserving, conserving and presenting cultural heritage\u000d\u000a      As part of the season, the Globe Theatre put on staged readings of two\u000d\u000a      very rare plays associated with Shakespeare and Germany: George Chapman's\u000d\u000a      Alphonsus, Emperor of Germany, and Henry Glapthorne's Albertus\u000d\u000a        Wallenstein, which helped to inspire Schiller. The Goethe Institute\u000d\u000a      screened equally rare and culturally significant filmic versions of\u000d\u000a      Shakespeare's plays, including The Jew of Mestri and Sven Gade's Hamlet.\u000d\u000a      This is a text-book instance of exhuming, preserving, conserving,\u000d\u000a      presenting and illuminating cultural heritage, since texts, both dramatic\u000d\u000a      and filmic, that are part of Britain's heritage and have become an\u000d\u000a      indispensable element in Germany's were dusted off and given a new lease\u000d\u000a      of life.\u000d\u000a    Creating, inspiring and supporting new forms of artistic expression\u000d\u000a      The season also featured an evening of clips by and discussions with\u000d\u000a      German artists and filmmakers Herbert Fritsch and Sabrina Zwach on their\u000d\u000a      ongoing project to re-envision Hamlet for our times (www.hamlet-x.de\/beschreibung).\u000a      The season thus demonstrably supported new forms of artistic expression.\u000d\u000a    Enriching the lives, imaginations and sensibilities of individuals and\u000d\u000a        groups\u000d\u000a      A total of 2,279 people attended the various events of the season, and\u000d\u000a      many more will have had their attention drawn to the existence of texts of\u000d\u000a      which they had previously been unaware (cf. e.g. https:\/\/blogs.warwick.ac.uk\/pkirwan\/entry\/alphonsus_emperor_of).\u000a      In a significant but not easily quantified way, therefore, the lives,\u000d\u000a      imaginations and sensibilities of very many individuals and groups were\u000d\u000a      enriched by this project.\u000d\u000a    Influencing the form and content of associations between groups to\u000d\u000a        illuminate cultural values\u000d\u000a      The collaboration between the Globe Education and the Goethe Institute\u000d\u000a      marked a major new departure. Without G&#246;rner's research and his personal\u000d\u000a      engagement, the two may never have realized the breadth and depth of the\u000d\u000a      common ground between them.\u000d\u000a    An exemplary case of the embodiment of research in the wider cultural\u000d\u000a        community\u000d\u000a      The whole season had the effect of embodying the conclusions of Professor\u000d\u000a      G&#246;rner's research in publicly accessible events in two venues in the wider\u000d\u000a      cultural community. And the fact that G&#246;rner's lecture has been adopted\u000d\u000a      world-wide by the Goethe Institute (6) corroborates the project's\u000d\u000a      exemplary importance.\u000d\u000a    Media resonance\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, many people have been led to rethink the cultural\u000d\u000a      relationship between Britain and Germany as a result of this series of\u000d\u000a      events. The season aroused considerable interest in the media of the two\u000d\u000a      countries, including both high brow and less high brow national\u000d\u000a      newspapers, popular and high cultural radio stations. It was also widely\u000d\u000a      discussed in both languages on the radio and on the internet.

A recurrent theme in this work is the German\u000d\u000a      reception of Shakespeare. Among the articles most frequently downloaded\u000d\u000a      from the Centre's journal Angermion is a paper (by John Guthrie,\u000d\u000a      Cambridge) on Schiller and Shakespeare, originally delivered at the\u000d\u000a      Centre's Anglo-German Poetologies colloquium in February 2009 (1). A paper\u000d\u000a      by R&#252;diger Singer on Goethe and Shakespeare featured in the Centre's\u000d\u000a      conference on Anglo-German Mythologies (2010) and in the resulting volume\u000d\u000a      (2). Angus Nicholls, the Centre's Deputy Director, contributed a further\u000d\u000a      paper on the role played by Shakespeare's reception in the formation of a\u000d\u000a      national German literature to the Poetologies colloquium; and Robert\u000d\u000a      Gillett, Section leader for Cultural Transfers, gave a paper on\u000d\u000a      Shakespeare and Ralf K&#246;nig to the AGS lead panel on Anglo-German Cultural\u000d\u000a      Relations in 2007. Moreover, in his many publications on German\u000d\u000a      literature, on English literature and on the relationship between the two,\u000d\u000a      for which he was elected to the Deutsche Akademie f&#252;r Sprache und Dichtung\u000d\u000a      in Darmstadt in 2011 and awarded the Deutscher Sprachpreis in 2012,\u000d\u000a      R&#252;diger G&#246;rner repeatedly returns to the abiding influence of the British\u000d\u000a      national poet on German authors (3).\u000d\u000a    Out of this interest arose the idea of making Goethe's writings on\u000d\u000a      Shakespeare available in distinguished new English translations. Following\u000d\u000a      notable collaborations with the Austrian Cultural Forum, the British\u000d\u000a      Museum, the Goethe Institut, the Institute of Germanic &amp; Romance\u000d\u000a      Studies (IGRS) and the German Embassy, this particular project attracted\u000d\u000a      the interest of the Globe theatre. The Globe not only undertook the\u000d\u000a      publication and distribution of the book, but also took it as the\u000d\u000a      inspiration for a multi-faceted season of events in which the question of\u000d\u000a      the affinity between Germanic Cultures and Bardic Britain was explored in\u000d\u000a      markedly original and imaginative ways.\u000d\u000a    The specific inspiration for this season were two pieces of research by\u000d\u000a      R&#252;diger G&#246;rner: a series of reflections on Goethe's relationship with\u000d\u000a      Shakespeare, which became the afterword to the new bilingual edition of\u000d\u000a      the Goethe texts (4), and a lecture on the German Preoccupation with\u000d\u000a      Shakespeare, delivered at the Globe Theatre on 21.10.2010 and published as\u000d\u000a      part of a book on Anglo-German Cultural Relations submitted to the current\u000d\u000a      REF (5).\u000d\u000a    The key findings of this research are that, far from being an isolated\u000d\u000a      British phenomenon, Shakespeare helped found German national culture, and\u000d\u000a      that the crucial German work on Shakespeare, be it translation,\u000d\u000a      production, criticism or the aesthetic incorporation of him as\u000d\u000a      productively unclassical, can and historically did revise and enrich the\u000d\u000a      English perception of their national author. The purpose of the events at\u000d\u000a      the Globe Theatre and the Goethe Institute was to prove this conclusion\u000d\u000a      and to put it into practice.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18032","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    When it initially came out in Russia, Rayfield's Chekhov biography\u000a      generated much agitation and criticism. Reviews published in newspapers\u000a      and in major `thick journals' (addressed to the broad reading public),\u000a      almost unanimously objected to the emphasis on Chekhov's private life and\u000a      especially to the inclusion of numerous allegedly `unnecessary' details.\u000a      This applies equally to major literary critics such as Andrei Nemzer and\u000a      to prominent writers like Viktor Erofeev. Reviews came out in Zvezda,\u000a      in the Moscow cultural events magazine Afisha, as well as in\u000a      numerous academic journals. Radio Liberty staged a polemic between\u000a      Rayfield and Erofeev (03\/07\/2005).\u000a    However, by 2010, when Russia celebrated the 150 anniversary of Chekhov's\u000a      birth, public opinion began to recognise the intrinsic value of Rayfield's\u000a      biography. The famous actor Oleg Tabakov was quoted stating that the\u000a      biography should be sent free to all Russian schools (http:\/\/goo.gl\/YxhmPj).\u000a      The MKHAT theatre, where Chekhov's plays where first staged, placed an\u000a      extended discussion of the biography on its website. In it, Anatoli\u000a      Smelianski, then the Director of Moscow Arts Theatre School, states that\u000a      'I don't remember any monograph by a Western scholar on a Russian author\u000a      having such success ... Nikita Mikhalkov said that before this book came\u000a      out we didn't know Chekhov' (www.rg.ru\/2010\/04\/05\/chehov.html).\u000a    The public debate inspired by the biography prompted several interviews\u000a      with Rayfield on radio, TV, and in newspapers. The biography became the\u000a      object of a radio programme (1). The Russian TV channel Kul'tura\u000a      broadcast an interview with Rayfield (2). Major, broad-circulation\u000a      newspapers such as Novaia gazeta (7), weeklies (8, 9), and\u000a      internet magazines (12) likewise published interviews. Reviews appeared in\u000a      mainstream literary newspapers (10), magazines (11) and internet journals\u000a      (13). Blogs and reader reviews also demonstrate a lively engagement (14).\u000a      The biography was discussed at a roundtable at the Institute of Russian\u000a      Literature of the Academy of Sciences in 2010 (http:\/\/lit.lib.ru\/k\/karalis_d_n\/text_0990.shtml).\u000a      Filmmaker Andrey Mikhalkov-Konchalovsky recommended it in his blog (www.konchalovsky.ru\/recommendations\/)\u000a      and praised it on Russian Pervyi Kanal TV as recently as New Year 2013 (http:\/\/goo.gl\/4gG09g)\u000a    The biography was then used by documentary and feature filmmakers to\u000a      produce movies that explore Chekhov's private life and recast the received\u000a      understanding of his personality. Evgenii Tsymbal (Bafta award, 1989) and\u000a      Sergei Golovetskii produced the documentary film The Mystery of\u000a        Chekhov (2010), released on DVD, which explores the international\u000a      resonance of Chekhov (3). It features an interview with Rayfield, along\u000a      with Peter Stein, Falk Richter, and Alexander Sokurov. Swiss television\u000a      (SF1 and 3sat) produced a movie about Chekhov's relationship with women\u000a      based largely on Rayfield's biography, Tschechow Lieben: Work und\u000a        Leben von Anton Tschekhow, dir. by Marina Rumjanzewa (4). It again\u000a      includes an interview with Rayfield. The compound audience rating of its\u000a      various runs is above 105,000 viewers. The Russian TV network Rossiia\u000a      broadcast a programme that similarly presents a more differentiated view\u000a      of Chekhov's personality. Produced by Aleksandr Avilov, Chekhov in the\u000a        21C: Doctor Chekhov; A Recipe for Immortality (2010) was broadcast\u000a      on Russian TV Rossiia on 25\/01\/2010. The synopsis of the film acknowledges\u000a      the use of Rayfield's biography (5). Much the same applies to the\u000a      documentary film broadcast on Russia's other major TV network Pervyi\u000a      kanal, Chekhov; Unpublished life (2010), dir. by Sergei\u000a      Kozhevnikov, in which Rayfield is interviewed as the main authority on\u000a      Chekhov's life (6). It was broadcast on 30\/01\/2010 and online.\u000a    The biography also informed the production of recent feature films about\u000a      Chekhov's life. The movie Poklonnitsa (The Worshipping Lady)\u000a      (Lenfilm, 2011), dir. by Vitalii Mel'nikov, which depicts the illicit love\u000a      affair between Chekhov and writer Lidia Avilova, rests significantly on\u000a      Rayfield's biography (www.afisha.ru\/movie\/210231\/).\u000a      In an interview published in Rossiiskaia gazeta (02\/04\/2009), the\u000a      director acknowledged the impact of Rayfield's `remarkable' book, which\u000a      `removes all the veils, destroys all the stereotypes about the writer' (www.rg.ru\/2009\/04\/02\/kino.html).\u000a      His film, produced by one of the two major Russian film studios, features\u000a      famous actors such as Oleg Tabakov and Svetlana Kriuchkova and won two\u000a      prizes. In a discussion of the movie, Tabakov praises Rayfield's biography\u000a      as one of the books that shaped his understanding of Chekhov (Rossiiskaia\u000a        gazeta, 05.04.2010) (www.rg.ru\/2010\/04\/05\/chehov.html).\u000a    The biography also inspired a theatrical production. The `documentalist'\u000a      playwright Elena Gremina turned Rayfield's biography into a play entitled\u000a      Brat'ia Ch. (The Brothers Ch.), staged in the Moscow Stanislavsky\u000a      Theatre in 2010. The critic Marina Davydov called the play `a dramaturgic\u000a      (and extremely terse) paraphrase of Rayfield's book' (http:\/\/goo.gl\/jQ3CoR).\u000a      In the US, writer, director, and producer of theatre and film Laura\u000a      Strausfeld wrote a screenplay on the relations between Chekhov and Suvorin\u000a      partly based on Rayfield's biography, which is currently in\u000a      pre-production. Much of the theatre and film work she has done in the past\u000a      10 years was likewise inspired by Rayfield's biography.\u000a    Meanwhile in England Rayfield's biography has set a model of scrupulous\u000a      fact-based biographical writing. Michael Frayn called it `without question\u000a      the definitive biography of Chekhov'. Arthur Miller wrote a laudatory\u000a      review in Sunday Times, and so did William Boyd in The\u000a        Guardian. Although these reviews predate 2008, Rayfield's biography\u000a      remains a reference. In an article published in The Observer on 2\u000a      October 2011, William Boyd praises Claire Tomalin's biography of Dickens\u000a      as `worthy to stand beside Richard Ellmann on Joyce, Donald Rayfield on\u000a      Chekhov and Jean-Yves Tadie on Proust' (http:\/\/goo.gl\/aSOHOO).\u000a    Indicators (2008-2013)\u000a    Radio programmes\u000a    (1) Radio Svoboda. 02\/02\/2010.Discussion of merits of Rayfield's\u000a      biography.\u000a      www.svobodanews.ru\/content\/transcript\/1946763.html\u000a    TV programmes and documentary films\u000a    (2) Channel Kultura, 28\/11\/09.

Substantial further research came from archival\u000a      holdings in the Russian State Archives for Literature and Art in Moscow,\u000a      the Pushkin House in St Petersburg, and Chekhov museums and archives in\u000a      Taganrog, Yalta, etc. Consultation was made by travelling through Russia\u000a      and the Ukraine from Sumy to Ufa, visiting Chekhov's summer houses, etc,\u000a      in car journeys between 1992 and 1997.\u000a    The novelty of the research rests on an examination of some 10,000\u000a      letters to Chekhov (which are often more revealing of his inner and\u000a      everyday life than his own letters), in addition to the correspondence and\u000a      (unpublished) diaries of his family, friends, and contemporaries. Research\u000a      reveals the way in which Chekhov's prose and drama uses material (letters,\u000a      remarks, characters, events) from the lives of others around him.\u000a    The main findings were 1. that Chekhov was, for much of his life, a\u000a      ruthless womaniser, even a sexual tourist; 2. that there were sporadic\u000a      actions in which, contrary to his established reputation, he treated\u000a      people (especially those close to him) and even pet animals with what can\u000a      only be called cruelty; 3. that many incidents, characters, even phrases\u000a      in his work are taken from letters written to him, so that a number of\u000a      short stories and at least two of the plays ('The Wood Demon' and 'The\u000a      Seagull') can now be read as bombshells designed to explode in the theatre\u000a      and affect a small number of persons in the audience (who see themselves\u000a      caricatured) &#8212; thus creating a drama which is simultaneously enacted on\u000a      stage and in the stalls and boxes of the theatre, and which has a\u000a      cathartic effect on his own life; 4. that Chekhov read rather more widely\u000a      than has been assumed, and that such works as a biography of the Bront&#235;s,\u000a      profoundly influenced his own; 5. that he had a relish for pornographic\u000a      light verse and, on occasions in his letters, for unprintable verbal\u000a      abuse; 6. that he nurtured, rather than suppressed or treated his own\u000a      illness.\u000a    The biography and related publications thus resulted in a complete\u000a      recasting of the received understanding of Chekhov's personality and in a\u000a      thorough debunking of the nearly hagiographic account presented in Soviet\u000a      publications. A number of discoveries and assertions in the biography have\u000a      been subsequently developed by others in the field.\u000a    The research was undertaken by Prof. Donald Rayfield, then Chair of the\u000a      Russian Department at Queen Mary, between 1993 and 1997. The biography was\u000a      published in 1997 (London), 1998 (New York), and again in 2009 (London).\u000a      The Russian version, published first in 2004 and now in its sixth edition\u000a      (2011), was updated and translated by Olga Makarova, then Research\u000a      Assistant at Queen Mary, and revised by Rayfield.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18130","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3932488","Name":"Peru"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impacts on cultural life of this project &#8212; on museums in the UK and\u000d\u000a      internationally, and on the\u000d\u000a      lives of Andean weaving communities &#8212; are potentially far reaching and its\u000d\u000a      immediate impacts are\u000d\u000a      clear and significant.

A series of ESRC funded workshops and seminars were\u000a      organised where the researchers reported their work-in-progress to the\u000a      partners and stakeholders. At the end of the project, a conference\u000a      reported on the findings to all stakeholders and complementary schools for\u000a      different ethnic communities in the country. A further series of public\u000a      events to disseminate research findings, funded by three consecutive ESRC\u000a      Social Science Festival grants (2009-11) were run in collaboration with\u000a      Camden Council and Coram's Fields Children's Centre, for parents and\u000a      childcare professionals. (Source 2)\u000a    The most significant impacts of the project fall into two overlapping\u000a      categories of public services and education and are evident in the\u000a      following developments:\u000a    \u000a      Increased awareness and understanding among stakeholders of the\u000a        significance of community languages and complementary schools and\u000a        willingness to build partnerships.

Local Authorities in the cities researched have\u000a        given new grants and awards to complementary schools and best teachers\u000a        in these schools.

There has been a major attitudinal change amongst the\u000a        teachers towards codeswitching by the children. Rather than seeing it as\u000a        a linguistic deficit, codeswitching is now regarded as evidence of\u000a        linguistic creativity and criticality as Professor Li Wei has argued.\u000a        (Source 5)\u000a    \u000a    The international reach of this research and its impact on the Chinese\u000a      schools across the globe is evidenced in:\u000a    \u000a      Numerous invitations to Professor Li Wei to give presentations to\u000a        Chinese heritage schools associations in the USA (Los Angeles, 2009; New\u000a        York, 2010), Australia (Sydney, 2010), Switzerland (Basil, 2010), Japan\u000a        (Yokohama, 2011), and Kazakhstan (Astana, 2012).

This is the only comparative socio-linguistic\u000a      project examining dynamic codeswitching by teachers and pupils in\u000a      complementary schools in the Chinese, Turkish, Guajarati and\u000a      Bangladeshi\/Bengali communities in Birmingham, Leicester, London,\u000a      Manchester and Newcastle. Complementary schools (also called Heritage or\u000a      Community Language Schools), a major world-wide educational and\u000a      cultural-political movement since the 1950s, are represented by\u000a      international organisations in a wide range of languages. In the UK, the\u000a      education charity, ContinYou, has a register of over 2,000 complementary\u000a      schools. Li Wei led the study of the Chinese schools in London, Manchester\u000a      and Newcastle.\u000a    Using Linguistic Ethnography, the project collected and analyzed\u000a      empirical data of multilingual practices by teachers and pupils in and\u000a      outside the classroom in complementary schools, and interactions between\u000a      the children and their parents. Interviews with key stakeholders (e.g.\u000a      community leaders, officials of local education authorities, mainstream\u000a      schools teachers) reveal the tensions and conflicts in the discourses and\u000a      ideologies regarding multilingualism and multilingual practices of\u000a      minority ethnic children. Professor Li Wei's research, which used the\u000a      Chinese complementary schools as an example, led to:\u000a    i. A reassessment of multilingual practices such as codeswitching,\u000a      challenging the widely held view that codeswitching, especially by young\u000a      children, is a sign of linguistic and cognitive deficit and incomplete\u000a      knowledge of the languages they use and counteracting concerns of parents\u000a      and professionals that codeswitching hinders the children's educational\u000a      development. Instead Professor Li Wei presented codeswitching in terms of\u000a      creativity and criticality. He defines creativity as the ability\u000a      to choose between following and flouting the rules and norms of behaviour,\u000a      including the use of language; pushing and breaking the boundaries between\u000a      the old and the new, the conventional and the original, the acceptable and\u000a      the challenging. Criticality he defines as an ability to use\u000a      evidence appropriately, systematically and insightfully to inform\u000a      considered views of cultural, social and linguistic phenomena, to question\u000a      and problematize received wisdom, and to express views adequately through\u000a      reasoned responses to situations (Ref 2-6).\u000a    ii. A critique of the public and professional discourses regarding\u000a      minority ethnic and immigrant communities, particularly the children, as\u000a      well as policies and ideologies of the complementary schools. Professor Li\u000a      Wei identifies three kinds of discourses &#8212; crisis, neglect and celebration\u000a      &#8212; that are differentially associated with different communities, and\u000a      challenges the ideological assumptions behind such discourses. While\u000a      acknowledging the achievements and the important role of complementary\u000a      schools for minority ethnic children, he also raises the issue of implicit\u000a      monolingual policies (e.g. One Language Only (OLON) or One Language at a\u000a      Time (OLAT)) in these schools that aim to prevent multilingual practices\u000a      such as codeswitching (especially Refs 2, 3 and 4).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18132","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Raleigh International is a charity providing international expeditions\u000d\u000a      for young people (aged 17-24) and volunteer managers (25+) since 1984. In\u000d\u000a      2008, the organisation approached Zhu Hua about reviewing their\u000d\u000a      educational programmes, with a view to developing a process for\u000d\u000a      accrediting learning outcomes which would recognise the unique learning\u000d\u000a      experience gained through Raleigh expeditions. In 2009, an ERSC\/TSB funded\u000d\u000a      Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) (2009-11) was set up to develop\u000d\u000a      Raleigh's pedagogical framework and an accrediting system. The project\u000d\u000a      team was led by Professor Zhu Hua and included Professor Sue Jackson,\u000d\u000a      Raleigh International representatives, and a KTP Associate. It reviewed\u000d\u000a      training resources and systems employed by Raleigh before developing the\u000d\u000a      project outcomes: 1) a training manual to support educational programmes\u000d\u000a      in the UK and overseas; and 2) a new qualification for Raleigh's volunteer\u000d\u000a      managers: a Post-graduate Certificate in International Field Leadership\u000d\u000a      (IFL) which is provided by Birkbeck (Sources 1 &amp; 2). The main impacts\u000d\u000a      of this project were on the participating partner, Raleigh International,\u000d\u000a      but broader impacts included benefits to CISV (see below).\u000d\u000a    The impacts on Raleigh International extended beyond the immediate\u000d\u000a      development of the accredited training programme, enhancing its position\u000d\u000a      as an organisation with intercultural communication at its centre:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Raleigh International established a coherent pedagogical framework for\u000d\u000a        the charity's volunteer programmes, designed to suit participants'\u000d\u000a        needs. Refocusing on quality of delivery contributed to the wider\u000d\u000a        strategic plan to focus on accreditation for older volunteers. Following\u000d\u000a        the creation of the accreditation system there was an upsurge in\u000d\u000a        interest from prospective volunteers, wanting to enhance their\u000d\u000a        employability potential through the expedition experience.\u000d\u000a      Raleigh created a new middle management role of Education and\u000d\u000a        Development Officer to drive forward the education\/accreditation and\u000d\u000a        impact research agenda, better aligning the charity with stakeholders'\u000d\u000a        interests at a national and international level.\u000d\u000a      A memorandum of agreement signed between Raleigh International and\u000d\u000a        Birkbeck established the course for the Post-graduate Certificate in\u000d\u000a        International Field Leadership in 2010. There were ten graduates from\u000d\u000a        the programme in September 2011 (including four full-time members of\u000d\u000a        Raleigh staff) and a further 11 are currently registered.\u000d\u000a      Raleigh International set up an Educational Advisory board\u000d\u000a        representing employers, policymakers and international experts in\u000d\u000a        leadership, cultural awareness, lifelong learning, experiential\u000d\u000a        education, global citizenship, accreditation and youth education.

The collaboration contributed\u000d\u000a        to Raleigh International's success in recent years in winning funding\u000d\u000a        from the Department of International Development (DfiD) for its Global\u000d\u000a        Ambassadors' programme, and from the Department of Business, Innovation\u000d\u000a        and Skills (BIS) for the Raleigh bursary award.\u000d\u000a      Raleigh International gained a stronger international profile,\u000d\u000a        enabling it to engage in international debate and research on\u000d\u000a        Leadership, Global Citizenship and Intercultural Communication and\u000d\u000a        improve links and collaboration with local communities and new partners\u000d\u000a        overseas.\u000d\u000a      The net effect of the partnership increased levels of synergy across\u000d\u000a        the sites of delivery, far greater consistency and quality of delivery\u000d\u000a        to all participants (circa 1400 a year).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The above can be corroborated through Sources 3 and 4.

The Secretary\u000d\u000a        General of CISV International writes that the KTP project with CISV\u000d\u000a        enabled them to develop a new website with intercultural communication\u000d\u000a        at its heart. Subsequently Professor Zhu Hua was invited to become a\u000d\u000a        member and deputy chair of the Education Committee of CISV. She has\u000d\u000a        spoken at CISV's general assembly, advised them on the development of\u000d\u000a        various training programmes, evaluation procedures, and research\u000d\u000a        publications, Interspectives: A journal on Transcultural Education.\u000d\u000a        A former UK branch Chair of CISV and Education Officer of CISV is now\u000d\u000a        working on a PhD evaluating the work of the organization under Professor\u000d\u000a        Zhu Hua's supervision.

As the\u000d\u000a      Ukrainian daily newspaper Den' (25 May 2012) reported, `Dr\u000d\u000a      Finnin's fresh approach to the study of Ukrainian culture... has made\u000d\u000a      Ukraine an accessible cultural and social space for the European public' [1].\u000d\u000a    In 2009 his research into the artistry of Taras Shevchenko led him, in\u000d\u000a      partnership with the University's Department of History of Art, to\u000d\u000a      organise an exhibition at Cambridge's Michaelhouse Centre of over twenty\u000d\u000a      prints of the poet's paintings. Entitled `Verse in Vision', the event\u000d\u000a      explored commonplaces in Shevchenko's poetic and painterly languages and\u000d\u000a      presented his self-portraits as visualised forms of lyric address. The\u000d\u000a      exhibition was attended by an estimated 2,000 local residents, students,\u000d\u000a      and tourists, all of whom received informational pamphlets about\u000d\u000a      Shevchenko's life and work, written and designed by Dr Finnin. In May\u000d\u000a      2009, Dr Finnin invited over twenty students from the Cambridge Russian\u000d\u000a      School to the exhibition, where they recited Shevchenko's verse in Russian\u000d\u000a      translation to celebrate his penchant for cultural and linguistic\u000d\u000a      exchange. According to the Director of Studies at the Cambridge Russian\u000d\u000a      School, `Dr Finnin's exhibition and literary reading allowed our students\u000d\u000a      and parents to encounter Shevchenko as a complex artist committed to\u000d\u000a      exchange and dialogue between national groups' [2]. This positive\u000d\u000a      response led Dr Finnin in 2010 to launch the annual Vsesvit Readings in\u000d\u000a      Celebration of Literary Translation, which feature student recitations of\u000d\u000a      literary texts in various languages. In 2013 Dr Finnin built on this\u000d\u000a      momentum, discussing his research on the significance of Shevchenko's\u000d\u000a      lyric address in a Ukrainian-language interview with Radio Liberty (14\u000d\u000a      March 2013) [3]. The interview elicited an enthusiastic response\u000d\u000a      from the public, with over 9,000 downloads and 272 likes on Facebook in\u000d\u000a      one week alone.\u000d\u000a    In 2008 Dr Finnin's work on the historical and cultural position of the\u000d\u000a      figure of the Crimean Tatar in Ukrainian culture, which the Crimean Tatar\u000d\u000a      community has described in the Russian-language media as `breathtaking'\u000d\u000a      (11 May 2012) [4], led him to organize the film festival `At the\u000d\u000a      Crossroads', which premiered documentary and feature films about Ukraine's\u000d\u000a      Muslim Tatar legacy. Held at the Cambridge Arts Picturehouse, the event\u000d\u000a      met with a very enthusiastic response from the public. Over 250 people\u000d\u000a      attended the sold-out screenings, which were accompanied by pre- and\u000d\u000a      post-screening discussions with Dr Finnin. An attendee remarked: `Before\u000d\u000a      attending this event, my partner and I knew almost nothing about Ukraine\u000d\u000a      and its religious diversity. We discovered an amazing country with a\u000d\u000a      turbulent past and a multi-ethnic culture' [5]. The event's\u000d\u000a      success prompted Finnin to establish an annual Cambridge Festival of\u000d\u000a      Ukrainian Film, which has since become a leading international showcase\u000d\u000a      for contemporary Ukrainian cinema, winning praise from many Ukrainian\u000d\u000a      civic organisations and news outlets, including the popular newspaper Komsomol'skaia\u000a        pravda (16 November 2011) (circulation: 1 million) [6]. Over\u000d\u000a      1,100 members of the public attended these screenings between 2008-12. As\u000d\u000a      celebrated Ukrainian filmmaker Volodymyr Tykhii remarked, `The Cambridge\u000d\u000a      Film Festival has helped me understand my own work within an international\u000d\u000a      cultural context.'\u000d\u000a    In 2009 Dr Finnin's scholarship on the public memory of Ukraine's history\u000d\u000a      inspired him to mount an exhibition at the Wren Library (Trinity College,\u000d\u000a      Cambridge) of the 1932-33 diaries of Cambridge alumnus Gareth Jones, the\u000d\u000a      only journalist to stake his name in reporting the Holodomor to the world.\u000d\u000a      The exhibition's methodology drew on Dr Finnin's scholarship into\u000d\u000a      effective commemorative practices in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, advancing\u000d\u000a      a documentary, text-based memorialization rather than a monumental one.\u000d\u000a      The exhibition was visited by 2,789 guests in a two-month period, and the\u000d\u000a      Wren Library Sub-Librarian remarked that `there was more international\u000d\u000a      interest and impact with this extremely powerful exhibition than with any\u000d\u000a      of our other offerings' [7]. Over 180 world media outlets,\u000d\u000a      including The Daily Telegraph (13 November 2009) and The\u000d\u000a        Guardian (13 November 2009), covered the exhibition.\u000d\u000a      Ukraine's national daily Den' reported that the exhibition exposed\u000d\u000a      `the entire world to the Holodomor'. The Kyiv Post (4 December\u000d\u000a      2009) quoted Finnin as saying that Jones's diaries `refocus the attention\u000d\u000a      from the political fighting [about the famine] to the voices of its\u000d\u000a      victims' [8]. Finnin also launched an exhibition website and\u000d\u000a      screened the UK premiere of a Ukrainian documentary (The Living,\u000d\u000a      2008) about Jones and the Holodomor to a capacity crowd at the Cambridge\u000d\u000a      Arts Picturehouse. In addition he gave radio and television interviews\u000d\u000a      with the BBC and leading Ukrainian and Russian media outlets, speaking\u000d\u000a      live on BBC World News (13 November 2009) (global audience 97 million) [9];\u000d\u000a      on the BBC World Service (13 November 2009) (global audience 145 million)\u000d\u000a      [10]; on BBC Wales (13 November 2009) (weekly reach 486,000) [11];\u000d\u000a      on BBC Look East (12 November 2009) [12]; and on Inter (8 December\u000d\u000a      2009), Ukraine's most watched television channel [13]. He spoke in\u000d\u000a      Russian on Radio Liberty (26 November 2011) (audience 4 million) [14]\u000d\u000a      and in Ukrainian for an interview with the Ukrainian newspaper Den'\u000d\u000a      (18 November 2009) [15]. In the words of journalist George Carey,\u000d\u000a      creator of Newsnight, `Finnin's work has done much to widen public\u000d\u000a      interest in this important but hitherto neglected aspect of twentieth\u000d\u000a      century history.' According to John Sweeney of BBC's Panorama, `Dr\u000d\u000a      Finnin's exhibition helped direct national media attention to the\u000d\u000a      Holodomor and offered the British public a new and better understanding of\u000d\u000a      Ukrainian history.'\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr Finnin's research has raised and enriched the profile of Ukraine as a\u000d\u000a      multi-ethnic and multi-confessional cultural space bound together by\u000d\u000a      projects of inter- and intra-national solidarity.

Finnin also deconstructed Shevchenko's image as an\u000d\u000a      anti-colonial, even nationalist rebel and fundamentally recast him as a\u000d\u000a      post-colonial artist committed to free exchange and play between Ukrainian\u000d\u000a      and imperial cultures.\u000d\u000a    In his scholarship on the twentieth century, meanwhile, Finnin presented\u000d\u000a      the historical and literary figure of the Crimean Tatar as a central\u000d\u000a      concern of Ukrainian culture. Indeed, his research into the significance\u000d\u000a      of Ukraine's Muslim legacy offered a corrective to what might be called\u000d\u000a      the predominant `Orthodox East Slavic' paradigm in Ukrainian Studies and\u000d\u000a      foregrounded Ukraine's complex ethnic and religious inheritance as a\u000d\u000a      critical object of knowledge. Finnin's work on coded and forgotten\u000d\u000a      Ukrainian and Russian literary responses to Stalin's brutal deportation of\u000d\u000a      the Crimean Tatars in 1944 also modelled a new solidarity-based approach\u000d\u000a      to the study of Stalinist violence and historical trauma.\u000d\u000a    Finnin also showed how and why Soviet dissidents used poetry to combat\u000d\u000a      what he calls the `discursive cleansing' that accompanied the ethnic\u000d\u000a      cleansing of Ukraine's Crimean Tatars. Moreover, he has argued that the\u000d\u000a      legacy of the Stalinist practice of `discursive cleansing', which he\u000d\u000a      defined as the process of disciplining speech through coordinated\u000d\u000a      epistemic and physical violence that is both retrospective and prospective\u000d\u000a      in its application, was uniquely responsible for the vigorous afterlife of\u000d\u000a      the memory of historical traumas in Eastern Europe. Finnin has therefore\u000d\u000a      foregrounded various texts, literary and documentary, that speak against\u000d\u000a      the silence that has shrouded Stalinist terror. He has also brought to\u000d\u000a      light the stories of Ukrainian dissidents and cultural figures who used\u000d\u000a      poetry to expose the Katyn tragedy, the Vinnytsia massacres, and the\u000d\u000a      Holodomor (the 1932-22 Terror-Famine) as interconnected crimes of the\u000d\u000a      Soviet regime. This work on the legacy of historical traumas like Katyn\u000d\u000a      and the Holodomor also involved a critique of `monumental' commemorative\u000d\u000a      practices in Ukraine, which can invite strict national metaphorical\u000d\u000a      readings.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19236","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Leeder's work has been disseminated to a wide variety of audiences\u000d\u000a      through symposia, public events, broadcasts, podcasts, close work with\u000d\u000a      writers and translation work in UK and abroad.

She has undertaken translation\u000d\u000a      commissions of GDR writers for commercial publishers e.g. of Volker Braun,\u000d\u000a      for International Poetry Review (USA April 2012), the Goethe\u000d\u000a      Institute- sponsored volume Kalendergeschichten (New Zealand,\u000d\u000a      2012) and for the prestigious UK poetry magazine Poetry Review\u000d\u000a      (June 2013). Her translations of Uwe Kolbe were presented at a public\u000d\u000a      event for school teachers, students, poets and cultural workers, `Poetry\u000d\u000a      under pressure' with GDR poets Richard Pietra&#223; and Uwe Kolbe, Cardiff,\u000d\u000a      June 2012 [ii]. Feedback demonstrated that the event had\u000d\u000a      helped people to better understand the context behind GDR poetry,\u000d\u000a      heightening their appreciation and interest in the history and poetry in\u000d\u000a      this area. Her translation of Durs Gr&#252;nbein's `Childhood in the Diorama'\u000d\u000a      (on his GDR childhood) won The Times Stephen Spender Trust Prize\u000d\u000a      2013[iii].\u000d\u000a    From Stasiland to Ostalgie (&#167;3:2) emerged from a seminar series in\u000d\u000a      2009 organized by Leeder, with international speakers, including Timothy\u000d\u000a      Garton Ash. All events were in English, open to the public and attracted\u000d\u000a      wide public participation (audiences of 40-85) from outside the academy,\u000d\u000a      especially among the expatriate community[iv]. Uniquely for\u000d\u000a      such a venture, the German Embassy chose to promote it in their public\u000d\u000a      anniversary programme for 2009 and the series was visited by the German\u000d\u000a      Cultural Attach&#233;. The high quality, timeliness and public impact of the\u000d\u000a      whole led to an invitation from the Embassy to launch the volume at the\u000d\u000a      Embassy-sponsored arts festival `Divided Skies 60 40 20', in January 2010\u000d\u000a      at The Soho Theatre, London, and to advise on and participate in a\u000d\u000a      specially commissioned panel discussion with GDR writer Anne Rabe, the\u000d\u000a      German Ambassador to London, David Tushingham (theatre practitioner), and\u000d\u000a      Hans Kundnani (journalist) among others (ticket sales of 60)[v].\u000d\u000a      The organizer of the festival commented: `I am very grateful to\u000d\u000a      [...] you for your valuable advice and help along the way. And thank you &#8212;\u000d\u000a      combining the performative arts with intellectual thought was exactly my\u000d\u000a      aim'[2]. Such impact was not confined to UK. The publicity for\u000d\u000a      the Stasiland volume led to an invitation to speak on the legacy\u000d\u000a      of the East German past in the cultural landscape at `The Changing Face of\u000d\u000a      Berlin', with Don Markwell, Peter Millar and Hartmut Meyer, Berlin, 7\u000d\u000a      November 2009 (to a public audience of 200) and a unique invitation to\u000d\u000a      take part in BBC Night Waves `Berlin Wall Twentieth Anniversary\u000d\u000a      Debate', live from Berlin on 9 November 2009 with Philip Dodd, Stefan\u000d\u000a      Aust, and Ingo Schulze (2.1 million listeners). The BBC commissioning\u000d\u000a      editor commented `She has been a vivid, informed and passionate speaker in\u000d\u000a      many of my programmes including a live special broadcast from Berlin to\u000d\u000a      mark the 20th anniversary of the Wall coming down. Her advice\u000d\u000a      and expert knowledge of the literature of the GDR was invaluable in our\u000d\u000a      preparations.'[3]\u000d\u000a    `Re-reading East Germany' (&#167;3:3) involved a public symposium organized by\u000d\u000a      Leeder on 24-25 March 2011, with twelve international speakers[vi].\u000d\u000a      The symposium included a bi-lingual public reading with Durs Gr&#252;nbein\u000d\u000a      (&#167;3:4) and Michael Eskin chaired by Leeder to launch the trade book\u000d\u000a      Gr&#252;nbein, The Vocation of Poetry, trans. Michael Eskin (New York,\u000d\u000a      2011) and to showcase the premiere (outside Germany) of Oktoberfilm\u000d\u000a      (2009) with a libretto by Gr&#252;nbein (audience of 70 - c. 50 from outside\u000d\u000a      the academy). Feedback questionnaires on this event were uniformly\u000d\u000a      positive underlining the `exceptional quality' of the events citing\u000d\u000a      Leeder's paper and Gr&#252;nbein's reading as highpoints that caused attendees\u000d\u000a      to change their views. Impact can be gauged from the fact that the South\u000d\u000a      Bank and GI organized a repeat performance of the reading at the Royal\u000d\u000a      Festival Hall on 29 March (ticket sales of c. 200).\u000d\u000a    The Spectres of the GDR project (&#167;3:6 and 7) has already\u000d\u000a      generated numerous opportunities for Leeder to collaborate in different\u000d\u000a      ways with artists, writers and thinkers interested in haunting: including\u000d\u000a      the Berlin avant-garde music and arts festival `CTM:12 - Spectrality' in\u000d\u000a      February 2012, a public conversation with philosopher John Gray at the\u000d\u000a      Purcell Room, London (audience of 700) on the way contemporary thought is\u000d\u000a      haunted by the legacy of Nazism and German totalitarianism [vii]\u000d\u000a      and the `Readers and Writers Festival' of New Zealand for a GI-sponsored\u000d\u000a      public event with GDR author Jenny Erpenbeck, discussing `Europe's Ghosts'\u000d\u000a      (March 13, 2012)[viii] which generated ticket sales of 200.\u000d\u000a      Leeder's event was one of a handful of the 50 festival events written up\u000d\u000a      for the local media and led directly to a radio spot on NZ radio (`Buried\u000d\u000a      Secrets' 28 March). Leeder's work on spectres was further exploited in\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinary public event `Giving up the Ghost: The Haunting of\u000d\u000a      Modern Culture', which took place in Oxford in March 2012 and included\u000d\u000a      talks by high profile public figures from outside the academy (e.g. the\u000d\u000a      artist Sarah Sparkes, the cultural commentator `k-punk', aka Mark Fisher,\u000d\u000a      and the UK poet David Constantine), and at which Leeder gave a talk on the\u000d\u000a      haunting of the Berlin Republic in theatre, performance, and photography\u000d\u000a      of the GDR. Attendance included schoolteachers, photographers, artists,\u000d\u000a      curators.\u000d\u000a    Her GDR expertise means that Leeder is the `go to' person for BBC radio\u000d\u000a      and television on aspects of GDR and contemporary German culture (`a\u000d\u000a      brilliant reviewer, a reliable source of advice and inspiration [...] her\u000d\u000a      advocacy of German writers has brought neglected and new works to the\u000d\u000a      attention of me and my colleagues at BBC Radio Arts' &#8212; statement by BBC\u000d\u000a      radio editor).[3] She is regularly invited to comment in the\u000d\u000a      national print media (e.g. her research is cited by name in Boyd Tonkin,\u000d\u000a      `The Art Of Memory', in the Independent, 2 January 2009, pp. 18-19,\u000d\u000a      and she was also commissioned by the Independent to write an\u000d\u000a      obituary of controversial GDR writer Christa Wolf (7 December 2011) [ix]\u000d\u000a      and in person (e.g. on the cold war and poetry and on the end of the GDR\u000d\u000a      at The Rest is Noise Southbank Centre), she was `In conversation'\u000d\u000a      with Anne McElvoy on the Stasi, Night Waves 10 February 2010 (1.9\u000d\u000a      million listeners); gave an interview for a BBC News Channel on `the end\u000d\u000a      of German war payments', 3 October 2010; and her Spectres project\u000d\u000a      led to an invitation to appear on Start the Week, 26 November 2012\u000d\u000a      with Andrew Marr (2.4 million listeners) [x].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Leeder has played a significant role in developing public understanding\u000d\u000a      and appreciation of the culture of the German Democratic Republic (GDR)\u000d\u000a      and its contested legacy after the unification of Germany in 1990.

Since arriving\u000d\u000a      in Oxford in 1993 she has carried out pioneering research establishing her\u000d\u000a      as one of the UK's leading specialists on GDR literature and the legacy of\u000d\u000a      the East German state.\u000d\u000a    Leeder's early research at Oxford addressed the last generation of poets\u000d\u000a      to emerge from the former East Germany. She was among the first to analyse\u000d\u000a      the interplay of official and underground culture, and the infiltration of\u000d\u000a      the samizdat scene by the secret police. Her Breaking Boundaries\u000d\u000a      (1996) was the first book in English or German to present an account of\u000d\u000a      this generation of writers who (in the phrase of GDR poet Uwe Kolbe) were\u000d\u000a      `born into' really existing socialism and how they sought to extend its\u000d\u000a      aesthetic possibilities [see &#167;3.1]. It offered first accounts of\u000d\u000a      writers (e.g. Durs Gr&#252;nbein) who would go on to be key figures in the\u000d\u000a      united Germany, and has been widely reviewed as `pioneering',\u000d\u000a      indispensable', `a standard on the topic'.\u000d\u000a    Leeder's research on the aesthetic and political legacy of German\u000d\u000a      socialism has continued in various ways, both examining the nostalgia for\u000d\u000a      the state's utopian promise that brought a new word into the German\u000d\u000a      language (`Ostalgie') and the traumatic aftershock of its totalitarian\u000d\u000a      reality. The twentieth anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall (2009)\u000d\u000a      crystallised these tensions and her From Stasiland to Ostalgie: The GDR &#8212; Twenty\u000d\u000a\u0009  Years After (ed. and Intro. Leeder) appeared in November\u000d\u000a      2009 itself as one of the first volumes to mark this anniversary [&#167;3.2].\u000d\u000a      Reviews (unusual for an edited journal) have uniformly praised it as\u000d\u000a      `sophisticated', `stimulating' and `invaluable'. In related projects she\u000d\u000a      has also examined the trajectory of key GDR writers &#8212; from controversial\u000d\u000a      classic Brecht to major icon of the Berlin Republic Durs Gr&#252;nbein. The\u000d\u000a      widely-reviewed Brecht &amp; the GDR (contrib. and co-ed. with\u000d\u000a      Bradley 2011), for example, addresses the cultural management of Brecht's\u000d\u000a      legacy in and after the GDR. Leeder's own chapter innovatively examines\u000d\u000a      Brecht's `late work' in the GDR [&#167;3.3] and has been singled out for\u000d\u000a      praise in reviews (e.g. Dreigroschenheft). Durs Gr&#252;nbein: A\u000d\u000a        Companion (ed., and contrib., 2013), the flagship first volume of a\u000d\u000a      new series on Contemporary German Culture, of which Leeder is a founding\u000d\u000a      editor, examines this key writer in and after the GDR, offering the first\u000d\u000a      comprehensive account of him in English. Leeder's own contribution\u000d\u000a      explores his engagement with science explicitly as a vehicle to leave\u000d\u000a      behind GDR ideology and invent a `new grammar of being' in the West [&#167;3.4].\u000d\u000a    Leeder has also sought to chart and theorize the cultural legacy of the\u000d\u000a      GDR as a whole, proposing innovative readings of the `death and afterlife'\u000d\u000a      of the GDR though the exploitation of medieval `danse macabre' motif, for\u000d\u000a      example, the fascination with Hamlet, or the symbol of the\u000d\u000a      vampire, in literature, films and art. This research led to her symposium\u000d\u000a      Re-reading East Germany which united a `dream team' of\u000d\u000a      international scholars (CUP reader's report) in 2012 to offer fresh\u000d\u000a      critical (and often controversial) re-readings of the state (reassessing\u000d\u000a      the canon beyond the charged political debates, proposing new ways of\u000d\u000a      approaching the legacy) and will, astonishingly, furnish the first volume\u000d\u000a      in English to chart GDR culture and its demise as a whole. It also led to\u000d\u000a      a major, AHRC-supported interdisciplinary project on Spectres of the\u000d\u000a        GDR: The Haunting of the Berlin Republic [&#167;3.5]. This\u000d\u000a      examines the `afterlife' of the GDR in the Berlin Republic through the\u000d\u000a      striking topos of ghosts and highlights the importance of a `spectral\u000d\u000a      turn' in contemporary German art, film, and culture in which the\u000d\u000a      unaccommodated memories of the spectre of German communism are manifested.\u000d\u000a      Several articles in refereed journals (e.g. NGC article 2012 on\u000d\u000a      spectres in Volker Braun [&#167;3.6]) and invited lectures address the\u000d\u000a      topic with reference to different authors: e.g. lecture on `Christa Wolf's\u000d\u000a      phantom pain' in Harvard, Julia Schoch's `unheimliche Heimat' in\u000d\u000a      Nottingham and `Visitations in Contemporary German Culture' at Victoria\u000d\u000a      University, Wellington (all 2011-12).\u000d\u000a    This research collectively addresses the cultural implications of one of\u000d\u000a      the most important historical events of the twentieth century and stresses\u000d\u000a      the vital contribution that culture can make towards understanding,\u000d\u000a      interpreting and influencing political and cultural change.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19237","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Curtis's reputation as a specialist on Russian literature, with\u000a      particular reference to drama, has led to collaborations with several\u000a      leading and high profile British theatre companies since 2008, supporting\u000a      them in staging Russian drama (or dramatising Russian prose texts) in a\u000a      wide variety of ways. Her work has had several key impacts including 1)\u000a      improving the quality of translations available to theatres; 2) improving\u000a      the quality of performances through educating the cast on the specifics of\u000a      Russian literary history and theatrical practice; 3) contributing to the\u000a      professional practice of theatres, by enabling the directors and backstage\u000a      teams to provide a more authentic or convincing staging; and 4) engaging\u000a      the interest and enriching the experience of audiences within and beyond\u000a      theatres, through talks, podcasts and the writing of features for theatre\u000a      programmes. The beneficiaries have included theatre companies themselves\u000a      (directors, cast and crew), a playwright, and theatre-goers as well as the\u000a      wider general public.\u000a    1) improving the quality of translations available to theatres\u000a    Based on her research in Russian Theatre outlined in &#167;3, Curtis has been\u000a      involved in evaluating translations as well as creating a new translation\u000a      of a Russian play for use in theatres. Through doing this she has improved\u000a      the standard of translations in use, giving the actors and audiences a\u000a      more accurate portrayal of the original text. In 2009 she was involved in\u000a      reviewing for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) the translations\u000a      of two newly-commissioned plays, Vorozhbit's The Grainstore, and\u000a      the Durnenkovs' Drunks. In 2011 she made a literal translation of\u000a      Galin's Stars in the Morning Sky, for the Belgrade Theatre\u000a      (Coventry). She was able to give advice to the playwright adapting her\u000a      translation for the stage, allowing him to overcome difficulties in the\u000a      work: `I'm very glad I made the visit, and came home feeling much clearer'\u000a      he said [1].\u000a    2) improving the quality of performances through educating the cast\u000a    Curtis has led significant educational work with casts of actors,\u000a      allowing them to delve into the specifics of Russian literary history and\u000a      theatrical practice, thus enabling them to create more accurate\u000a      portrayals, using authentic methods. She delivers education mainly in the\u000a      form of talks and workshops with the casts. In 2008 the Artistic Director\u000a      of the RSC, named Curtis his `Special Adviser' as he prepared a 3-year\u000a      project of theatre from and about Russia This included Curtis providing\u000a      six workshops in Stratford and London for about 150 people, including the\u000a      entire acting company, as well as many other RSC staff (producers,\u000a      directors, administrative team, props, music, movement etc.). The sessions\u000a      offered an introduction to Russian history and language, and a Q&amp;A\u000a      about the plays they were working on. These workshops were felt by the\u000a      company to be very useful to them: `Thank you again for your inspiring\u000a      help.'[2].When Curtis interviewed the Artistic Director for the\u000a      RSC's International Council, in the presence of HRH Prince Michael of\u000a      Kent, one RSC officer commented that `One of the catering staff [...] is\u000a      doing theatre studies and said she learned more in that hour than she has\u000a      in hours of college lectures!' [2]. In 2010 Curtis also\u000a      fulfilled an invitation from the Director of the National Theatre (NT),\u000a      to talk to the cast of The White Guard about Bulgakov and the\u000a      historical background to the play.[3]\u000a    3) contributing to the professional practice of theatres, for more\u000a        convincing stagings\u000a    From 2009 to 2011, Curtis as `special advisor' to RSC's Artistic Director\u000a      found herself regularly responding to queries from RSC departments about\u000a      any aspect of their Russian projects, including helping the set designers,\u000a      text and voice coach, sound designer, and prop-makers to create authentic\u000a      materials (artefacts, images, music etc.). `This is fantastic! Everything\u000a      we need &#8212; thank you so much, I don't know what I'd do without you!' [2]\u000a      In 2010 Curtis also helped the RSC Director and her designer with project\u000a      planning for Rona Munro's Little Eagles (about Gagarin and the\u000a      Soviet space programme). The Director said `The notes and references are\u000a      incredibly useful. [...] Thank you for all your ongoing knowledge and\u000a      advice!' [4]. Michael Billington in the Guardian gave the\u000a      production 4 stars and wrote `It is a huge subject, but Munro, director\u000a      Roxana Silbert and designer Ti Green admirably convey the excitement of\u000a      scientific progress [...] Munro is also good on the interaction between\u000a      politics and science[...] Munro makes history come alive...'.[i]\u000a    Curtis also took up an invitation from the Director of Complicit&#233;,\u000a      to meet and discuss his ideas for staging an adaptation of the notoriously\u000a      difficult The Master and Margarita by Bulgakov, at the Barbican in\u000a      2012. Curtis' research on this Russian author, the basis of her advice to\u000a      the Director, in turn made a contribution to how this adaptation was\u000a      staged. The production was widely reviewed in the mainstream and theatre\u000a      press; WhatsOnStage review of the production online says `Complicit&#233;'s\u000a      extraordinary staging of Bulgakov's 'unadaptable' The Master and\u000a      Margarita has returned to the Barbican, providing a welcome opportunity\u000a      for those of us who missed it the first time to see what all the fuss is\u000a      about[...] the fuss is still justified, and I staggered out after three\u000a      and half hours feeling much as I expected to &#8212; utterly overwhelmed with\u000a      ideas and imagery.' [ii] The production also got attention in\u000a      the social media sphere. One blogger tried to explain the impact of\u000a      viewing such a complex story and production. He said ' As I left the\u000a      Barbican after seeing Complicit&#233;'s take on The Master and Margarita,\u000a      I thought to myself that was simply extraordinary but I have no idea why\u000a      and tweeted something to that effect. I couldn't really explain it in any\u000a      kind of meaningful way and in some ways even if I could, it still wouldn't\u000a      do it justice[...]but it did tap into something more visceral. I found\u000a      myself inexplicably moved at several moments[...]ultimately that did it\u000a      for me: I certainly didn't `get' it all but it really didn't matter for me\u000a      in the final analysis.' [iii]\u000a    4) enriching the experience of audiences within and beyond theatres\u000a    After featuring in BBC programmes about Russian theatre on Chekhov (Radio\u000a      3), and on Bulgakov (Radio 4), Curtis was approached by the National\u000a      Theatre to write the programme notes for their production of Bulgakov's The\u000a        White Guard in 2010. This allowed her to give the audience an\u000a      in-depth understanding of the story and the history and cultural\u000a      references behind it. NT Head of Publications wrote to Curtis: `Thank you\u000a      so much; this looks perfect. I think you've taken just the right tone for\u000a      our audience'[5]. An art blogger wrote `The background is\u000a      supremely well explained in the programme essay by the Oxford Russianist,\u000a      Julie Curtis, one of the best such efforts I've ever read.' [iv]\u000a      Another reviewer said `the &#163;3 programme is a gem containing helpful\u000a      excerpts and comments by Julie Curtis of Wolfson College, Oxford. The\u000a      quotations I wrote above are all taken from her notes.' [v]\u000a      Curtis was asked to conduct an interview with Michael Boyd about Pushkin's\u000a      play Boris Godunov, which provided the main feature for the show's\u000a      programme. She also wrote other features for programmes in 2012 including\u000a      for the Belgrade Theatre's production of Galin's Stars in the\u000a        Morning Sky and the Barbican's production of The Master and\u000a        Margarita, and did a members' talk and discussion for the Barbican\u000a      audience on 5 January 2013.She gave them an insight into the background\u000a      and key themes of the novel, after which they split into smaller groups to\u000a      share their thoughts in a book-club style discussion. They gained a deeper\u000a      understanding of the play from hearing Curtis' research insights and the\u000a      discussion allowed them to explore areas that had particularly engaged\u000a      them. [vi]\u000a    Curtis has also been involved in digital media outreach activities that\u000a      have served to help a global audience to feel closer to the plays and the\u000a      history and ideas behind them. She co-featured in a National Theatre film,\u000a      broadcast as an introduction to John Hodge's play about Bulgakov (Collaborators)\u000a      when it was shown in cinemas worldwide on 1 December 2011. This was part\u000a      of the National Theatre Live project (the National Theatre's\u000a      groundbreaking project to broadcast the best of British theatre live from\u000a      the London stage to cinemas across the UK and around the world,\u000a      productions to date reaching audiences of over 800,000 in 22 countries).\u000a      Curtis' film helped cinema audiences to get closer to the author and story\u000a      before watching the production. They also created a 20-minute podcast\u000a      based on this which can be accessed on the NT website and iTunes page [vii]\u000a      One blogger wrote `This is a handy podcast pre\/post show viewing to get a\u000a      more in-depth look into the real-life character of Mikhail Bulgakov,\u000a      played by Alex Jennings. A great listen! She has also presented on other\u000a      NT video podcasts `An introduction to Collaborators' and `An Introduction\u000a      to Anton Chekhov' [viii]. The Chekhov video features in the\u000a      `Playwright' section of the NT website, with videos designed to give the\u000a      viewer explanations of a well-written play from the perspective of a\u000a      playwright and advice for first time writers. It enables audience\u000a      engagement pre- and post-performance. The videos are free to watch, and to\u000a      demonstrate the reach, the videos in the collection have been viewed 1.5\u000a      million times according to the annual report for 2011-12.[ix]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Staging Russian plays in British theatres presents specific difficulties,\u000a      ranging from the remoteness of cultural and historical points of reference\u000a      down to the complexity of Russian names.

Her long-standing commitment to the analysis of Russian\u000a      drama dates back to the publication of two previous books about the\u000a      leading 20th-century playwright and novelist Mikhail Bulgakov. Over the\u000a      last decade this ongoing research has been underpinned by the constantly\u000a      updated scholarly investigations she undertakes for the specialist\u000a      undergraduate and postgraduate options she offers. These include a course\u000a      entitled `Russian Drama of the 19th and 20th centuries', which encompasses\u000a      the rich tradition of Russian drama inaugurated by Pushkin in the 1820s,\u000a      via Gogol' and Chekhov, and right up to contemporary dramatists such as\u000a      Ivan Vyrypaev.\u000a    Since 1993 she has published a scholarly edition of Bulgakov's play Beg\u000a      (Flight) (Bristol Classical Press, 1997). In her introduction to\u000a      this, his most cherished work for the stage, she shows how he continues\u000a      his account of the Civil War period in Soviet Russia, as already portrayed\u000a      in his Days of the Turbins, but refashions it in a modernist\u000a      theatrical mode which represents a startling break with the realist vision\u000a      of the previous play. This paradox is further explored in her new article\u000a      for Modern Language Review, which considers the explicit dialogue\u000a      between Bulgakov's drama and the Futurist\/Constructivist theatrical vision\u000a      of Maiakovskii and Meierkhol'd. These projects have allowed her to\u000a      investigate the contrasts between the two major trends of 20th-century\u000a      Russian theatre, encapsulated in the Chekhovian realism of Stanislavskii\u000a      and the experimental work of Meierkhol'd. She has also explored the ways\u000a      that these evolved in the relatively liberal cultural and political\u000a      atmosphere of the 1920s, followed by the years of Stalin's Terror. This\u000a      theatrical and historical background is what theatre directors have asked\u000a      her to elucidate for them, when working both with their casts of actors,\u000a      and with their technical and literary staff.\u000a    The primary research project she has been engaged in since 2008 is the\u000a      completion of the first major biography of the writer Evgeny Zamiatin\u000a      (1884-1937). Though best known for his novel We, along with his\u000a      stories and essays, Zamiatin was also very ambitious to achieve success in\u000a      the theatre, like his great friend Bulgakov. Appointed to a state\u000a      committee to promote historical drama in 1919, Zamiatin's first\u000a      contribution to the new theatre of the Soviet era was his controversial\u000a      play about the Inquisition, soon banned, The Fires of Santo Domingo.\u000a      His most successful plays were his adaptation for Stanislavskii's Moscow\u000a      Arts Theatre of Leskov's story Leftie, staged with brilliant\u000a      designs by Kustodiev in 1925 under the title of The Flea, and his\u000a      adaptation of Hecht and MacArthur's Broadway hit The Front Page\u000a      for the Vakhtangov Theatre. The crisis over the rejection of his play Attila\u000a      in the late 1920s was a major factor in his leaving the USSR in 1931.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19238","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2960313","Name":"Luxembourg"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Beyond its academic dissemination and recognition, Sheringham's work on\u000d\u000a      the city, the everyday and the archive has fostered creative attention to\u000d\u000a      the collective and individual dimensions of urban experience, cultural\u000d\u000a      memory, and everyday life through events and interventions. These have\u000d\u000a      mediated and made accessible the ideas of thinkers, creative writers and\u000d\u000a      artists whose work focuses in different ways on the everyday world. He has\u000d\u000a      articulated research findings in articles, reviews and lectures that have\u000d\u000a      wide non-academic circulation, in interviews in journals for the wider\u000d\u000a      public, in talks to professional bodies, in gallery talks, and in radio\u000d\u000a      broadcasts; been pitched accessibly, always aiming to make often complex\u000d\u000a      ideas comprehensible to the non-specialist. He has involved French as well\u000d\u000a      as English contexts, so as to encourage interchange between non-\u000d\u000a      specialist audiences in different language communities, creating\u000d\u000a      opportunities for his work to appear in (primarily French) translation.\u000d\u000a      Improved public awareness and more informed debate have been brought about\u000d\u000a      in various contexts.\u000d\u000a    Increasing Public Understanding of the concept of everyday life:\u000d\u000a      After Everyday Life [see &#167;3.2] appeared, Sheringham was invited to\u000d\u000a      deliver four lectures: Po&#233;tique du quotidien: la rue, la journ&#233;e,\u000d\u000a        l'archive (March 2007) at the Coll&#232;ge de France. Whilst the lectures\u000d\u000a      occurred out with the REF impact period the lectures were later (2008)\u000d\u000a      broadcast on the national radio station France Culture; podcasts of three\u000d\u000a      of the lectures were made available on its website for a period afterwards\u000d\u000a      [i]. Everyday Life sold well and appeared in\u000d\u000a      paperback in June 2009. This has meant that the book is much more\u000d\u000a      accessible to public audiences, furthering public understanding of the\u000d\u000a      concepts explored by the author. A French edition, translated by Maryline\u000d\u000a      Heck and Jeanne-Marie Hostiou, came out with Presses Universitaires de\u000d\u000a      France in Spring 2013. The French edition Travers&#233;es du quotidien: des\u000d\u000a        surr&#233;alistes aux postmodernes was part of the book series `Lignes\u000d\u000a      d'Art', aimed `not only at scholars and specialists, but all those\u000d\u000a      interested in the on-going evolution of artistic activity' [ii].\u000d\u000a      Advance publicity for the translation included two substantial interviews,\u000d\u000a      and a long review article in leading French journals for the general\u000d\u000a      public: Esprit, August 2010; Europe, January 2012; Critique,\u000d\u000a      December 2008.

In April 2009 Sheringham organised a\u000d\u000a      study day on `Paris and Visual Arts' for Oxford's Department for\u000d\u000a      Continuing Education, and in February 2013 he gave a lecture on City\u000d\u000a      poetry entitled `Inspired by Paris', at a day school in the same context\u000d\u000a      (average attendance 80 people).\u000d\u000a    Round Tables and Workshops at cultural centres and literary and art\u000d\u000a      festivals, addressed to non- academic audiences, include events at the\u000d\u000a      French Institute in South Kensington (June 2009); the first EVENTO Arts\u000d\u000a      Biennale in Bordeaux (a major arts festival across the city, October 2009)\u000d\u000a      [v]; the annual literary festival, Rencontres de\u000d\u000a        Chaminadour held at Gu&#233;ret (Creuse) in September 2009, where\u000d\u000a      Sheringham was also interviewed (see France Culture website [vi])\u000d\u000a      for a radio programme `Carnet Nomade' based on the event; and the annual\u000d\u000a      literary festival Enjeux de la litt&#233;rature contemporaine, held at\u000d\u000a      the Petit-Palais in Paris (January 2011).[vii]\u000d\u000a    Applying the concept to the work of professional bodies, practitioners\u000d\u000a        and creators:\u000d\u000a      Sheringham's work on the aesthetics of experimental, and often\u000d\u000a      archive-based, everyday projects led in February 2009 to an open lecture\u000d\u000a      at the Architectural Association in London, and a follow-up seminar to an\u000d\u000a      audience of c. 100. Imparting insights from his research but also\u000d\u000a      discovering new facets Sheringham and his audiences engaged in a mutually\u000d\u000a      enriching dialogue bearing on such issues as the place of memorialization\u000d\u000a      in the city and different ways in which individuals engage creatively with\u000d\u000a      urban space. A further invitation to lecture there, which had to be\u000d\u000a      declined for health reasons, testifies to Sheringham's reputation for\u000d\u000a      `accessibiity and transparency' in addressing varied audiences [1].\u000d\u000a      Sheringham was approached more recently by a tutor at the Architectural\u000d\u000a      Association to present his work as part of one of their teaching units:\u000d\u000a      `In 2008\/09 when I was a student in the Histories and Theories MA\u000d\u000a      programme directed by Marina Lathouri you had given a seminar talk to our\u000d\u000a      class, followed by a lecture at the school. The talk and your writings\u000d\u000a      have been of great influence to my research to date. I have been doing\u000d\u000a      quite a bit of research over the last 4-5 years on Georges Perec and the\u000d\u000a      Oulipo group and the role that constraints play in the design process,\u000d\u000a      both literary and architecturally. This research is the basis of the new\u000d\u000a      Intermediate unit that I am launching at the AA this year. I am starting\u000d\u000a      to put together a seminar series for the unit and wanted to reach out to\u000d\u000a      you and see if you would have interest in giving a seminar talk [...] It\u000d\u000a      would be great to have you down to London as I know your expertise would\u000d\u000a      be very beneficial to the students.\".[2]\u000d\u000a    As one of twelve fellows at the Camargo Foundation at Cassis (France) in\u000d\u000a      September-December 2010, Sheringham engaged in dialogue with writers,\u000d\u000a      composers and visual artists as well as historians and a sociologist. By\u000d\u000a      bringing American and British contributors together in a French context\u000d\u000a      this fellowship generated new ways of thinking across national boundaries.\u000d\u000a      The everyday and the archive proved to be key concepts in rich exchanges\u000d\u000a      in which the local audience, made up of teachers, local government\u000d\u000a      officials and other interested parties collaborated enthusiastically,\u000d\u000a      responding to the benefits of cross-fertilisation between disciplinary\u000d\u000a      perspectives and between reflective and creative outlooks and practices.[3]\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a    Contributions to Museums and Art Galleries: In March 2010, in the\u000d\u000a      contemporary art space, Casino Luxembourg, Forum d'Art Contemporain, in\u000d\u000a      Luxembourg, Sheringham contributed to a public lecture series in the\u000d\u000a      context of an exhibition called `Everyday(s)'[viii]. By\u000d\u000a      providing an opportunity to link the exhibited artworks with a range of\u000d\u000a      ideas on everyday life, this event prompted the audience to consider the\u000d\u000a      value of creative reflection on everyday experience at individual and\u000d\u000a      collective levels. The Whitechapel Gallery, London, with MIT Press, has\u000d\u000a      twice reprinted sections of Everyday Life in the Documents of\u000d\u000a      Contemporary Art series (print run 4200).The series provides access to a\u000d\u000a      plurality of voices and perspectives on a specific subject or body of\u000d\u000a      writing that has been of key influence to contemporary art internationally\u000d\u000a      in a format accessible for the general art-going public.[xi]\u000d\u000a      The commissioning editor said of the extract of Sheringham's work used in\u000d\u000a      Johnstone's anthology: `[...]there is no other text that sets out the\u000d\u000a      connection, as you do so brilliantly, between the concerns of figures such\u000d\u000a      as Lefebvre and the characteristics of the project, as explored in the\u000d\u000a      works of artists such as Sophie Calle, who is also included in this\u000d\u000a      collection. Particularly due to the descriptive examples, this is an ideal\u000d\u000a      text for many of the intended readers, who will be artists and art\u000d\u000a      students, not all of whom will be familiar with French theory.'[4]\u000d\u000a    By engaging with these different types of interlocutor and beneficiary\u000d\u000a      Sheringham has brought his research on the everyday, the city and the\u000d\u000a      archive to bear on the concrete existences of his audiences, helping them\u000d\u000a      to think about neglected or depreciated facets of their everyday lives.\u000d\u000a      This refocusing of attention changes in a range of ways the individual's\u000d\u000a      awareness of the balance between participation in solitary and collective\u000d\u000a      experience. It does so by encouraging recognition of the creative\u000d\u000a      potential harboured by the everyday, for instance in the potential of city\u000d\u000a      experience to energise and diversify experience creatively, and to make us\u000d\u000a      aware of the extensive `archives' of collective memory manifested in the\u000d\u000a      institutions, monuments and trajectories that make up the cityscape many\u000d\u000a      of us inhabit.[5]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Michael Sheringham's recent work has explored how thoughtful\u000d\u000a      attention to everyday life can enhance individual and collective\u000d\u000a      experience. One essential strand is city life; another is seeing our\u000d\u000a      individual stories as intertwined with the multiple histories that have\u000d\u000a      shaped our daily environment, and hence seeing memory as an archive.\u000d\u000a      Sheringham's writings, broadcasts and public appearances have brought\u000d\u000a      together creative writers, artists, film-makers, philosophers and social\u000d\u000a      theorists, across the Humanities, Social Sciences, and visual and\u000d\u000a      performing arts.

His recent\u000d\u000a      explorations of everyday life and urban experience grew out of his earlier\u000d\u000a      work on the genre of autobiography, which connects literature and ordinary\u000d\u000a      experience. The engagement with everyday life brings autobiography into\u000d\u000a      the wider field of `life-writing', linked with creative writing and with\u000d\u000a      narratives focused on individual experience and memory, and also\u000d\u000a      introduces a wider range of artistic practices. His co-edited collection The\u000a        Art of the Project [see &#167;3.1], investigated how artists in various\u000d\u000a      media have set up quasi-scientific (often parodic) experimental projects\u000d\u000a      in the sphere of daily practices, to show that art can convey particular\u000d\u000a      forms of knowledge.\u000d\u000a    Everyday life has often been condescendingly dismissed as banal routine;\u000d\u000a      Sheringham's work explores its value and richness. While previous research\u000d\u000a      on everyday life arose within discrete disciplines such as social\u000d\u000a      anthropology, architecture and planning, philosophy, art, or literature,\u000d\u000a      Sheringham's originality lies initially in his comparative and synthetic\u000d\u000a      approach. His book Everyday Life [&#167;3.2] maps out a whole new\u000d\u000a      disciplinary field. Sheringham analyses a wide range of twentieth-century\u000d\u000a      literary and reflective writing, and distils an account of everyday life\u000d\u000a      as structured (one's `day' has a shape), historical (one's\u000d\u000a      day repeats the routine of many previous days and thus sustains one's\u000d\u000a      identity through memory), and interpersonal (one is always dealing\u000d\u000a      with others, at home, at work, and even in the street, which is a place of\u000d\u000a      performance and self-display).\u000d\u000a    Sheringham's research also connects everyday life with `archive studies'\u000d\u000a      [&#167;3.3-4]. In 2009-10 he held a Leverhulme Fellowship for a project on\u000d\u000a      `Archival Identities' that linked the above-mentioned themes with the\u000d\u000a      widespread contemporary fascination with archives &#8212; the material remains\u000d\u000a      of the past &#8212; and with the intellectual and ethical questions they raise.\u000d\u000a      He also asks why archives, archivists, archival projects and archival\u000d\u000a      journeys feature so prominently in contemporary European fiction and\u000d\u000a      life-writing philosophy and theory; historiography; and the visual arts.\u000d\u000a      His research foregrounds urban life, which poses the challenge of\u000d\u000a      maintaining communal life and values in a new setting. He has published a\u000d\u000a      number of articles exploring the everyday, the city, and the archive\u000d\u000a      focusing particularly on Paris [&#167;3.5-7].\u000d\u000a    Sheringham's work invites individuals to focus more closely on their own\u000d\u000a      experience, to find value in its everyday fabric, and, especially, to\u000d\u000a      value the everyday &#8212; and its reflections in city life and in the\u000d\u000a      interaction of social and individual memory &#8212; as an essential ground of\u000d\u000a      existence, instead of being depreciated or neglected in favour of more\u000d\u000a      specialised and goal-directed activities. He suggests how educators,\u000d\u000a      practitioners and curators can be encouraged to make everyday experience\u000d\u000a      central to their activities.\u000d\u000a    The research underpinning this case study was carried out principally in\u000d\u000a      the context of Sheringham's chair at Oxford, with periods at UC Berkeley\u000d\u000a      (in 2006), where, as Pajus Distinguished Visiting Professor in French,\u000d\u000a      Sheringham co-organised a conference on poetry and the everyday and taught\u000d\u000a      a seminar on `The Everyday and the Archive'. At the Camargo Foundation in\u000d\u000a      Cassis, France (2010), where a three-month fellowship enabled him to work\u000d\u000a      with composers, visual artists, and creative writers.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19239","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Cronk has had experience of presenting Voltaire to a broader public: he\u000d\u000a      wrote and presented three programmes on Voltaire in the Radio 3 series\u000d\u000a      `The Essay' (November 2010), and more recently spoke about Candide\u000d\u000a      on Melvyn Bragg's In Our Time (May 2012); in 2013 he did a number\u000d\u000a      of press, radio and TV interviews about his `discovery' of some Voltaire\u000d\u000a      manuscripts, and gave a talk about this (`Voltaire's lost letters') at a\u000d\u000a      recent Oxford alumni reunion, and at another alumni gathering in Paris.

There have been over 7000 downloads since January [A].\u000d\u000a      A free website was launched in April 2013, and further versions of the app\u000d\u000a      (for iPhones and Androids notably) are also scheduled for release during\u000d\u000a      2013. The early success of the app is attested by its receipt of a Silver\u000d\u000a      `European Design Award' in 2013 for communication design excellence [B].\u000d\u000a    The app is divided into three parts:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aLe Livre: The French text, with as an optional extra, access to\u000d\u000a        the main (La Valli&#232;re) manuscript on the left-hand side of the screen.\u000d\u000a        The reader can read a plain text; or choose the academic annotation of\u000d\u000a        the Voltaire Foundation edition; or choose a simpler annotation,\u000d\u000a        specially commissioned, aimed at teenagers in the first instance. The\u000d\u000a        reader can also opt to hear the text read by one of France's leading\u000d\u000a        modern actors and comedians, Denys Podalyd&#232;s; his reading was specially\u000d\u000a        made for this app.\u000d\u000a      \u000aLe Monde: Readers can access a map of Candide's travels around\u000d\u000a        the world, and from there access further information about any idea of\u000d\u000a        interest: there are short essays on themes, iconographical collections,\u000d\u000a        maps, short videos of talks, etc. This section will continue to grow.\u000d\u000a      \u000aLe Jardin: The reader is encouraged to dig deeper and so\u000d\u000a        cultivate Candide's garden.

In particular, the app's encouragement to the reader to engage\u000d\u000a      with the text offers a unique, interactive experience: 'Ainsi la tr&#232;s\u000d\u000a      belle initiative d'Orange, de la BNF et la Voltaire Foundation (aucun\u000d\u000a      diable am&#233;ricain, les chagrins le constateront...) qui vous proposent de\u000d\u000a      red&#233;couvrir une &#339;uvre majeure de notre patrimoine litt&#233;raire, Candide de\u000d\u000a      Voltaire.

[E]Historical writer Anna\u000d\u000a      Gibson mentions the app on two of her French culture blogs: 'In the best\u000d\u000a      of all possible worlds, more publishing houses would look to the example\u000d\u000a      of the [sic] Orange, the Biblioth&#232;que nationale de France and the Voltaire\u000d\u000a      Foundation with their new, digitally enhanced version of Voltaire's\u000d\u000a      Candide. This new digital version may be better named an \"experience\"\u000d\u000a      rather than simple digital book.' [F] Cronk has written\u000d\u000a      about the app's development , publicly sharing his experience of the\u000d\u000a      particular challenges involved in preparing a literary classic for\u000d\u000a      transmission in a digital format, in the journal of the Biblioth&#232;que\u000d\u000a      nationale de France [G].\u000d\u000a\u0009  `Candide: l'&#233;dition enrichie'\u000d\u000a      has also been specifically targeted at school students. French teenagers\u000d\u000a      studying literature at school now rarely read books from cover to cover:\u000d\u000a      the syllabus asks them to study extracts from novels, arranged\u000d\u000a      thematically. So part of the challenge was to devise an app which would\u000d\u000a      encourage engagement with a classic, and impel students to then read the\u000d\u000a      book in its entirety. The Candide app represents an extremely\u000d\u000a      useful tool for both independent learning, and also for classroom\u000d\u000a      teaching, as demonstrated by the enthusiastic response from practitioners\u000d\u000a      via twitter [H], for example: @francophilia , `French\u000d\u000a      teachers, gorgeous free ipad app, interactive, participative for Candide.\u000d\u000a      The future is now!'; @celine_louis, `j'aurais ador&#233; avoir &#231;a &#224; l'&#233;cole RT\u000d\u000a      @LaboBnF: Candide, l'&#233;dition enrichie!'; @FrenchatLeeds, `The Candide app:\u000d\u000a      the best of all possible apps...'.

The\u000d\u000a      project began in 1968. As general editor, Nicholas Cronk (Professor of\u000d\u000a      French Literature, and Lecturer in the History of the Book) has managed\u000d\u000a      the project for the last decade and has been credited with revitalising\u000d\u000a      it. The project is now entering its final phase. The edition will be\u000d\u000a      complete by 2018, in over 200 print volumes. It has been widely acclaimed\u000d\u000a      as a monument of Enlightenment and textual scholarship. Cronk has himself\u000d\u000a      edited a number of volumes, notably the Questions sur l'Encyclop&#233;die\u000d\u000a      [2], a massive and relatively little-known late text by Voltaire\u000d\u000a      which is appearing in eight volumes; Cronk is co-author of the\u000d\u000a      introduction to this text, which is a monograph in itself.\u000d\u000a    Cronk's place at the centre of Voltaire studies has given him an\u000d\u000a      exceptionally deep and wide knowledge of Voltaire's copious oeuvre and its\u000d\u000a      literary and intellectual context. He has published extensively on aspects\u000d\u000a      of Voltaire's work and more generally on questions of authorship, writing,\u000d\u000a      and publishing in the eighteenth century. [3, 4, 5] He has given\u000d\u000a      particular attention to what is perhaps Voltaire's most famous work, Candide.\u000d\u000a      In 2009, Cronk organised in Oxford (together with Professor Nathalie\u000d\u000a      Ferrand, associate researcher at the Maison Fran&#231;aise d'Oxford),\u000d\u000a      the major international celebration of the 250th anniversary of\u000d\u000a      Candide, a three-day international conference with over 40\u000d\u000a      speakers, the proceedings of which have been collated in a forthcoming\u000d\u000a      publication [6].\u000d\u000a    The Cambridge Companion to Voltaire [7], edited by Cronk,\u000d\u000a      provided another opportunity to bring together the leading Voltaire\u000d\u000a      scholars in the UK and France, and to encourage them to synthesize the\u000d\u000a      most recent research in a way which would be accessible to the widest\u000d\u000a      number of readers.\u000d\u000a    As Director of the Voltaire Foundation, Cronk created the Besterman\u000d\u000a      Centre for the Enlightenment, as a means of involving scholars from a\u000d\u000a      variety of disciplines in the study of the international Enlightenment. He\u000d\u000a      is currently Pr&#233;sident of the French Soci&#233;t&#233; des &#233;tudes\u000d\u000a        voltairiennes, based at the Sorbonne, and is thereby connected with\u000d\u000a      networks of scholars across Europe.\u000d\u000a    To win new readers for Voltaire, especially among a young generation\u000d\u000a      often more familiar with new media than with traditional books, it is\u000d\u000a      necessary to take advantage of new technology. For this purpose, Candide,\u000d\u000a      with its perennial appeal, was the ideal text. The OCV includes\u000d\u000a      the definitive critical edition of Candide by Ren&#233; Pomeau, which\u000d\u000a      was the starting point for the digital edition `Candide, l'&#233;dition\u000d\u000a      enrichie' an iPad app. Cronk initiated the app's production, finding a\u000d\u000a      funder and the partners in France with whom to collaborate. He then acted\u000d\u000a      as the academic leader on the project. Orange (France) provided the\u000d\u000a      funding for the research and the project management; the Biblioth&#232;que\u000d\u000a      nationale de France provided access to their collections, and facilitated\u000d\u000a      collaboration with schoolteachers to write parts of the app. Planning\u000d\u000a      began in autumn 2011, the work was carried out in 2012, and the first\u000d\u000a      prototype of the app was launched as an iPad app at the beginning of 2013.\u000d\u000a      A second enhanced version was released later in 2013.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19565","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dr Arnold-de Simine's research is becoming increasingly widely recognised\u000a      within the museums\u000a      and heritage sectors in the UK, Germany and elsewhere (Sources 1 &amp; 2).\u000a      As a result of her\u000a      involvement in two AHRC networks `After the Wall' (2009-10) and `Silence,\u000a      Memory and Empathy\u000a      in Museums and at Historic Sites' (2012-2013), which brought together\u000a      academics, museum\u000a      directors, curators and guides from Germany and the UK (sources 3 &amp;\u000a      4), she has contributed to\u000a      the development of new exhibitions in three German museums, the Imperial\u000a      War Museum and a\u000a      new London cultural heritage site by providing advice on how to connect in\u000a      more complex and\u000a      nuanced ways with visitor responses.\u000a    The head of research at the GDR Museum, Berlin, informally consulted her\u000a      in March 2009 while\u000a      the museum was in the process of major refurbishment and extension. With\u000a      reference to her\u000a      research on the deep divide in GDR remembrance culture (refs 1, 2 and 4)\u000a      she was able to draw\u000a      attention to the reception of the museum's earlier exhibitions, pointing\u000a      to the need to embed its\u000a      focus on everyday life in the context of political oppression in the GDR.\u000a      This observation was\u000a      influential in revising and doubling the size of the exhibition when they\u000a      reopened in October 2010.\u000a      The museum's head of research writes, `There has been a long standing\u000a      co-operation between Dr\u000a      Arnold-de Simine and the GDR Museum Berlin. ... A major change was that\u000a      apart from the\u000a      everyday we now also provide more information on the political structures\u000a      and the economy of the\u000a      GDR as well as the oppression by the state and opposition to it. ...'\u000a      (Source 5)\u000a    With the director of Dokumentationszentrum Alltagskultur der DDR,\u000a      Eisenh&#252;ttenstadt,\u000a      (Documentation Centre of Everyday Culture of the GDR) in July 2009, she\u000a      discussed solutions to\u000a      reaching different memory communities. Based on her research that showed\u000a      the unresolved\u000a      tensions in GDR remembrance culture (ref 4) she encouraged the Centre to\u000a      explore ways of\u000a      making communicative memory more accessible to younger audiences and\u000a      suggested that it\u000a      showcase personal stories representing different memory communities and\u000a      portraying the different\u000a      effects of historical forces on individuals. These suggestions were\u000a      reflected in the new exhibition,\u000a      which opened in March 2012 and now includes recordings of eyewitness\u000a      accounts and their object\u000a      stories. The director writes: `The international and interdisciplinary\u000a      framework opened to us by Dr.\u000a      Arnold-de Simine and the \"After the Wall\" network has definitely proven to\u000a      be extremely helpful for\u000a      the conceptualization of a permanent exhibition.' (Source 6)\u000a    In discussions with the director of the Bernauer Strasse Wall Memorial in\u000a      Berlin, which was still a\u000a      work in progress in 2010, when they met, Dr Arnold-de Simine was able to\u000a      address the problems\u000a      which arise when a memorial museum has to serve memory communities with\u000a      different interests\u000a      and investment in the past and combine different forms of remembrance.\u000a      Drawing on her research\u000a      on conflicting demands on memorial museums (refs 3, 5 and 6) she\u000a      facilitated a discussion that fed\u000a      into design decisions. Dr Klausmeier writes: `The [...] exchange with\u000a      Silke was extremely fruitful,\u000a      since we were still experimenting with the site and its innovative design.\u000a      We were still testing new\u000a      means and ways in the field of commemorative landscapes, since we were\u000a      dealing with an historic\u000a      and authentic \"Berlin Wall-Site\" and simultaneously introducing a\u000a      completely innovative language\u000a      of design for commemorative cityscapes. ... She analysed in great detail\u000a      the problems which arise\u000a      when a memorial museum has to serve memory communities with different\u000a      interests and\u000a      investment in the past and combine different forms of remembrance.'\u000a      (Source 7)\u000a    Within the UK, Dr Arnold-de Simine has worked to encourage dialogue\u000a      between memory studies\u000a      and museum studies and between museum practitioners, educators and\u000a      academics in the UK. In\u000a      June 2012 she co-organised the Empathy and Memory Studies Conference\u000a      (Birkbeck, 23 June\u000a      2012) which was attended by approximately 200 people, (50% were\u000a      non-academics). A curator\u000a      and research officer at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) who attended the\u000a      conference,\u000a      subsequently contacted Dr Arnold-de Simine to discuss the redesign of the\u000a      permanent exhibition of\u000a      the IWM, London and the potential impact of concepts of empathy on this\u000a      project. Dr Arnold-de\u000a      Simine then became involved in a project with the Digital Learning Officer\u000a      at IWM focusing on\u000a      online resources for schools linked to the Centenary of the First World\u000a      War, which will be available\u000a      via IWMs website. He writes, `Silke and I have spoken a lot about objects\u000a      and how they are viewed\u000a      in various different media, including online. This has affected how I have\u000a      gone about selecting\u000a      objects, and I have been focussing primarily on the impact they will have\u000a      online and their ability to\u000a      convey our learning outcomes specifically within that medium.' In July\u000a      2013, at the conference\u000a      `Challenging Memories: Silence and Empathy in Heritage Interpretation',\u000a      they gave a collaborative\u000a      talk on the impact of digital media on the presentation of sensitive\u000a      material and the responsibility\u000a      this places on the museum. Fifty members of the network attended, half of\u000a      them non-academics\u000a      working in learning and education in museum and heritage sites, including\u000a      the Head of Learning\u000a      from the Imperial War Museum (Source 8).\u000a    The ongoing development of Dr Arnold-de Simine's research impact in\u000a      museum and heritage\u000a      sectors is reflected in her recent involvement (since May 2013) as an\u000a      adviser on an HLF funded\u000a      project to turn the last remaining steam coaster SS Robin into a heritage\u000a      site as part of the\u000a      regeneration of the Royal Docks in East London.

The key feature of\u000a      these sites is that they\u000a      deploy a variety of strategies revolving around theories of memory to\u000a      invite emotional responses\u000a      from visitors in an attempt to make them identify and empathize with\u000a      individuals and their\u000a      narratives. Dr Arnold-de Simine's research is situated in this emerging\u000a      field at the interface of\u000a      museum and memory studies. The underpinning research insights arise out of\u000a      her adaptation and\u000a      re-working of a wide range of memory theories from the English-, German-\u000a      and French-speaking\u000a      worlds. She engages critically with how collective memory reflects\u000a      emotional and ideological\u000a      investments in the past (Ref 1 and 2), but also investigates the ways\u000a      museum practitioners have\u000a      interpreted and adapted different theories around memory, trauma and\u000a      empathy within the\u000a      museum context.\u000a    In rethinking concepts and practices of memory transfer she reveals the\u000a      ethical, political and\u000a      aesthetic implications of emerging exhibition practices, associated with\u000a      the transformation of\u000a      traditional history and heritage museums into `spaces of memory' (Ref 3).\u000a      Her research examines\u000a      how very different types of museums use the prism of memory to provide\u000a      access to the past. She\u000a      has pointed to the problematic ethical implications of these practices\u000a      which have to do with who is\u000a      represented and how. She has challenged the tendency for museums to accept\u000a      simple\u000a      oppositional categories &#8212; the political or the personal (Ref 4), the\u000a      exceptional or the everyday, the\u000a      nostalgic or the traumatic &#8212; which may undermine their ability to\u000a      acknowledge more complex ways\u000a      of relating to the past. In this context, she analyses how different media\u000a      and art forms shape the\u000a      way memories are presented to and perceived by museum visitors (Ref 5).\u000a      She questions the\u000a      assumption that traumatic memories can and should be passed on through\u000a      processes of mediation\u000a      and that these processes necessarily foster empathy and\/or an increasingly\u000a      ethically responsible\u000a      behaviour outside the museum environment (Ref 6).\u000a    Arnold-de Simine's analysis has allowed her to engage and intervene\u000a      critically in new\u000a      developments in museological paradigms and in the practical implementation\u000a      of memory theories\u000a      in museums, drawing attention to the tensions and contradictions within\u000a      them. In doing this she has\u000a      established a new conceptual framework that challenges scholars and museum\u000a      practitioners to\u000a      critically question the use of memory as a framework in exhibition\u000a      practice.\u000a    In 2005 she was awarded a two month fully-funded Fellowship at the\u000a      Humanities Research Centre,\u000a      Australian National University (Canberra) which brought together academics\u000a      and artists working in\u000a      the field of Commemorations, Monuments and Public Memory which laid the\u000a      foundation of her\u000a      practice-led research. She was an active participant in two AHRC-funded\u000a      Networking Projects\u000a      (After the Wall, 2009-10; Silence, Memory and Empathy in Museums and at\u000a      Historic Sites, 2012-13).\u000a      These have provided a forum in which academics from different disciplines\u000a      can work together\u000a      with museum practitioners. As a member of the steering-committee for\u000a      \"After the Wall.\u000a    Representing and Remembering the GDR\" (2009-2010), she convened the first\u000a      workshop to foster\u000a      a comparative approach to theoretical paradigms of collective memory.\u000a      Museum practitioners in\u000a      Germany and the UK, who have participated in these events or have become\u000a      aware of her\u000a      research as a result of these networks, have particularly valued her\u000a      insights which helped them\u000a      understand the complex ways in which museum visitors engage with\u000a      exhibitions. For example,\u000a      when exhibitions ask visitors to get emotionally invested in memories and\u000a      stories which focus on\u000a      the experiences of individuals, their responses may interpret these\u000a      stories in unexpected ways.\u000a    In 2011 she was awarded a grant under the AHRC Fellowship scheme to\u000a      complete her monograph\u000a      Mediating Memory in the Museum, published with Palgrave Macmillan\u000a      in their prestigious Memory\u000a      Studies Series in October 2013. An AHRC assessor commented that Dr\u000a      Arnold-de Simine's\u000a      research is `outstanding, original and highly significant [...] It\u000a      promises to provide an important\u000a      scholarly \"pillar\" for an emerging field [...] which is at the interface\u000a      of a number of disciplines as\u000a      well as the interface of scholarly discussion and practical importance in\u000a      the museum landscape. It\u000a      promises to develop a new conceptual framework [...] which is not only of\u000a      academic interest but\u000a      vital for the construction of a sustainable civil society which\u000a      politicians so often refer to.'\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20049","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has influenced policy and practice within civil society\u000a      organisations at the national and international levels, as well as\u000a      individual aid workers. The impact has been achieved not only through\u000a      research publications and Kim's participation in important international\u000a      fora (as outlined in section 2), but also through the dissemination of\u000a      this work in journals aimed at a more general readership (in both Korean\u000a      and English), and through her active involvement as a policy advisor and a\u000a      senior research fellow, as outlined below.\u000a    i. Changing Organisational Policy and Planning\u000a    As a result of Kim's research on assessing Japan's climate financing in\u000a      Africa [output 5], ReDI invited her to work as an independent\u000a      consultant on the evaluation of the East Asia Climate Partnership\u000a      programme (EACP). This evaluation study of a US$200,000,000 climate change\u000a      financing project commissioned by the KOICA (Korean Grant Aid Agency)\u000a      included critical feedback and suggested amendments to the policy and\u000a      practice of KOICA's climate change financing. This subsequently resulted\u000a      in proposals to establish a policy agenda for KOICA's climate financing\u000a      and the creation of an evaluation framework for EACP and new evaluation\u000a      guidelines for KOICA's future multilateral climate funds. Kim has worked\u000a      with a group of researchers from ReDI, who have commented on the\u000a      significance of Kim's research for proposal design as well as the ways in\u000a      which her findings gave substance to policy and programmes: `In Korea,\u000a      there are very few people who (...) critically engage the issues of\u000a      environment, climate change and ODA architecture. (...) Soyeun has not\u000a      only informed us about the internationally debated issues including\u000a      changes in debates, various standard\/norm settings, but also has offered\u000a      directions on how to contextualise and understand those issues\u000a      structurally at policy level. (....) She has (...) enabled us to balance\u000a      between a rather technical nature of project evaluation (consultancy) and\u000a      a more theoretically oriented academic research through her research\u000a      (analysis and review) on evaluation frameworks developed and used by\u000a      international climate change initiatives, and turning those findings into\u000a      designing of an evaluation framework that is specific and suitable for the\u000a      EACP. [A]\u000a    The Head of Evaluation &amp; Consulting Office at ReDI further identifies\u000a      as important impacts Kim's contribution to the development of EACP's\u000a      strategy for future evaluation of multilateral projects through\u000a      identifying in her research the `need to reduce admin burden on the\u000a      multilateral organisation by working with their monitoring and evaluation\u000a      cycle (...) need to focus on a broad development result rather than\u000a      individual outputs' and for `the importance of follow-up research on the\u000a      possible changes in Korea's Green ODA and EACP climate finance' [A]\u000a    ii. Influencing Public Bodies\u000a    Kim's research outputs [1 &amp; 2] have been circulated widely to\u000a      both think-tanks and aid-agencies, where they have shaped thinking around\u000a      emerging donors within the mainstream aid architecture debates. For\u000a      example output [1] was cited in a special issue of the Japanese aid\u000a      agency JICA's internal policy briefing reports in 2011, which formed part\u000a      of the materials used to prepare JICA officials for negotiations on\u000a      agreeing new aid-effectiveness indicators during the 2011 High Level Forum\u000a      4 in Busan, South Korea: `Her work has provided an analytical [reference\u000a      point] to evaluate the emerging donors &#8212; which is extremely useful in\u000a      comprehensive understanding (and reviewing) of the various arguments and\u000a      debates on emerging donors, via her conceptualisation of DAC-ability. In\u000a      doing so, the nature of emerging donor issues\/debates became clear which\u000a      then has assisted JICA staff build their arguments (and also test the\u000a      feasibility of those arguments) in preparation for Busan'. [B].\u000a    As a policy advisor to ODA Watch, the only Korean NGO dedicated to aid\u000a      monitoring, and as Senior Research Fellow for the ReDI, which aims to\u000a      promote global development beyond bilateralism and donor-centred\u000a      practices, Kim's research and consultancy has been used by both of these\u000a      organisations to inform their thinking and practices especially in\u000a      relation to aid- ethics and environmental sustainability in aid practice.\u000a      Her outreach activities based on her research have led to changes in their\u000a      policies and practices: `The field of aid ethics is not popular in Korea,\u000a      thus her expertise on this issue contributed to raise this in this society\u000a      by ODA Watch'. `Her presentation on development ethics in 2010 at ODA\u000a      Watch policy forum and her column in 2011 in OWL (ODA Watch Newsletter)\u000a      [led to ODA Watch deciding this issue would be] included in major advocacy\u000a      items in 2012.' [C]\u000a    Based on her suggestions, ODA Watch have recognised the importance of\u000a      ethics, principles and philosophy of aid ethics which `is not familiar to\u000a      Korean international development society.'[C] By raising awareness\u000a      of the fundamental consideration of ethics and morality in aid provision,\u000a      Kim's research enables ODA Watch to present arguments based on `quality of\u000a      aid' in their campaigning on aid accountability and transparency, to\u000a      counter the currently dominant `quantity of aid' trend within Korea that\u000a      is fixated on increasing scale and volumes of aid provision. [C].\u000a      Kim runs free lectures and seminars on behalf of ReDI based on the issues\u000a      and themes addressed in her research, thereby building and strengthening\u000a      the analytical capacity of young researchers.[A]\u000a    iii. Enhancing the Understanding and Practice of Aid Workers\u000a    The wide distribution of Kim's research through regular contributions to\u000a      the ODA Watch newsletter (OWL) [3] drawing on her research,\u000a      has helped the organisation to achieve increased understanding and\u000a      exposure of the issue of aid ethics for their core readership of c.5000\u000a      subscribers, [C] ` her paper and professional advice contributed to\u000a      ODA watch, raised the aid ethics as a significant issue in Korea (...) her\u000a      ideas on aid ethics definitely contributed to ODA watch's advocacy work' [C]\u000a      feedback on the newsletter article [output 3] has shown\u000a      that the research has given individual Korean aid workers a deeper\u000a      understanding of these issues, which subsequently informs their practice.\u000a      One worker, a Team Leader for Humanitarian and Emergency Affairs at World\u000a      Vision Korea, wrote that Kim's article had influenced his perspective on\u000a      his work leading him to become `increasingly interested in ethical issues\u000a      in aid (...) and [give] serious consideration for ethics in international\u000a      development.' As a result he states that he has now integrated these ideas\u000a      into his frontline work `for my job, I often give lectures &#8212; and I have\u000a      shared my ideas and thoughts on ethical consideration with my audience.\u000a      That is why I sincerely hope your article would create positive\u000a      repercussion in the Korean society'.

Kim's work explores the vexed question of\u000a      the relationship between the DAC and non-traditional donors [1]\u000a      and more specifically the relationships which the DAC was seeking to build\u000a      at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s\u000a      fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, held at Busan, Korea in 2011\u000a      (Busan HLF4) and beyond; it examines the under-studied issue of Korean aid\u000a      in the context of mainstream aid-ethics debates [2&amp;3].\u000a    Empirical analysis and data including participatory observation at the\u000a      Busan HLF4 and the Busan Global Civil Society Forum in late 2011, through\u000a      the case study of Korea, were important in countering the reductionist\u000a      readings of emerging donors that were using the established normative\u000a      framework as a reference point; the research emphasises the significance\u000a      of the donor's own historical and institutional contexts in understanding\u000a      its case for aid activities and provision. In particular, output [4]\u000a      analysed differentiated notions of `value for money' and `results' by\u000a      emerging donors.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20470","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe introduction of respeaking\u000d\u000aThe training programme proposed by Romero-Fresco in his book has been adopted by the\u000d\u000auniversities of Barcelona, Vigo (Spain), Vienna (Austria) and Antwerp (Belgium) to start\u000d\u000apostgraduate modules on respeaking. This training programme has also been adopted by media\u000d\u000acompanies in different countries around the world. In 2009, the Spanish company Mundovisi&#243;n set\u000d\u000aup a respeaking team using Romero-Fresco's training methodology to provide, for the first time\u000d\u000aever, live subtitles through respeaking in Spain for the public channel TVE. Following two\u000d\u000aspecialised workshops delivered by Romero-Fresco and based on the above-mentioned research,\u000d\u000athe Italian media companies Deluxe and Subt-ti started providing live subtitles through respeaking\u000d\u000ain 2011, as did the British company TVT, which is currently using the methodology outlined in the\u000d\u000abook to provide live subtitles for BBC World in the United States.\u000d\u000aThe impact on the viewers and the industry\u000d\u000aRomero-Fresco's study on the viewers' reception of live subtitles in the UK, also included in the\u000d\u000abook, has had significant impact on both the viewers and professional practice in the field. The\u000d\u000aresults of the survey on viewers' preferences, which showed the need to raise awareness about\u000d\u000athe existence of respeaking in the UK, persuaded the BBC to prepare in collaboration with\u000d\u000aRomero-Fresco a special item on live subtitling for its BBC2 programme See Hear1. Broadcast on\u000d\u000a3 February 2011 and seen by 508,833 viewers, the programme included an interview with Romero-\u000d\u000aFresco where he explained the main findings of his research. Since then, it has been hosted on\u000d\u000aYoutube with a total of 20,267 views as of 15 July 2013. Some of the comments received from the\u000d\u000aviewers are \"I will certainly be less impatient with live subtitles now that I know how they are made\"\u000d\u000aand \"This is a fascinating documentary, a great way of getting across this service to so many\u000d\u000apeople who are hard of hearing and are not aware of live subtitles. Also, it will bring understanding\u000d\u000ato those whose hearing is so far unimpaired\". In Spain, an interview with Romero-Fresco about his\u000d\u000aresearch was presented in a news item by Canal 9's programme Gente on 25 January 20112. This\u000d\u000awas the first news item about respeaking ever broadcast in Spain and was seen by 81,944\u000d\u000aviewers.\u000d\u000aThe second part of the reception study on live subtitles, carried out as part of the DTV4ALL project\u000d\u000aand presented in Romero-Fresco's 2011 book, led to a significant change in professional practice\u000d\u000athat has reached not only broadcasters and subtitling companies, but also millions of viewers. The\u000d\u000aresults of the eye-tracking and comprehension tests showed that the word-for-word display mode\u000d\u000aof live subtitles often used in Switzerland and France prevents viewers from achieving an optimum\u000d\u000acomprehension of TV programmes. This problem can however be avoided if the subtitles are\u000d\u000adisplayed in blocks. Following the recommendations from this study, Swiss TXT (the leading Swiss\u000d\u000asubtitling company) changed their subtitling policy to introduce block subtitles in 2011. From then,\u000d\u000athe live programmes broadcast by the Swiss public channels SF1, SF2 and SF Info (in German),\u000d\u000aTSR1 and TSR2 (in French) and RSI 1 and 2 (in Italian), which are seen by an average of between\u000d\u000a1,564,138 and 4,066,758 viewers every day, are subtitled in blocks. In 2012, a workshop given by\u000d\u000aRomero-Fresco in Geneva also persuaded the leading French subtitling company MFP to stop\u000d\u000adisplaying their subtitles in scrolling mode. As a result, the live programmes on the main French\u000d\u000apublic channels (France 2, France 3 and France 5), with shares of 3.6%-14.4% (between 837,000\u000d\u000aand 3,100,000 viewers per day), are now subtitled in blocks.\u000d\u000aThe impact on the regulators\u000d\u000aRomero-Fresco's findings about the quality of live subtitling were presented on 19 April 2011 in the\u000d\u000ainaugural meeting of the United Nation's first Focus Group on Audiovisual Media Accessibility, of\u000d\u000awhich he is a member. In the UK, the main deaf associations (Action on Hearing Loss, Tag,\u000d\u000aHearing Concern and Link) used these findings in 2012 to demand the public regulator Ofcom to\u000d\u000atackle the issue of quality in live subtitling. Until then, Ofcom had only been concerned with the\u000d\u000aquantity of live subtitling, mainly by establishing quotas for the different British channels. Following\u000d\u000athe pressure by the user associations, Ofcom agreed to engage with the quality of live subtitles\u000d\u000aand asked Romero-Fresco for a model to assess the accuracy of live subtitles. After months of\u000d\u000aconsultation with broadcasters and service providers, Ofcom have now issued the first official\u000d\u000astatement about quality in live subtitling3. The public regulator urges broadcasters to inform their\u000d\u000apractice with the academic research carried out by Romero-Fresco on respeaking and presents his\u000d\u000aNER model (introduced in his 2011 book) as an example of how to assess the quality of live\u000d\u000asubtitles.\u000d\u000aIn Spain, the public regulator AENOR adopted in May 2011 the NER model and included it in the\u000d\u000aofficial Spanish guidelines on subtitling4. Every subtitling company in Spain is required to use it for\u000d\u000aquality control and training purposes. The model has also been adopted by the leading public\u000d\u000abroadcasters in Italy (RAI), Germany (ARD), Belgium (VRT) and Switzerland (SRG SSR). The\u000d\u000aapplication of the model ensures that the subtitles produced by these broadcasters and companies\u000d\u000ahave a minimum of 98% accuracy, thus providing the hearing-impaired viewers with optimum\u000d\u000aaccess to the TV programmes they are watching.\u000d\u000aRespeaking in new contexts\u000d\u000aThe research carried out by Romero-Fresco has also enabled the provision of live subtitles in\u000d\u000acountries and contexts where they did not exist before, such as university classrooms in South\u000d\u000aAfrica and live events, telephone conversations and secondary school classrooms in the UK.\u000d\u000aAlthough 9 of the 11 official languages in South Africa are African, most universities deliver their\u000d\u000acourses in English. The majority of South African students are thus at a disadvantage, having to\u000d\u000afollow classes in their third, fourth and sometimes fifth language. A visit to North-West University\u000d\u000a(Vaal Triangle) in October 2011 enabled Romero-Fresco to provide respeaking training to the\u000d\u000aresearchers in the Language Department. The aim was to use respeaking as a tool to subtitle\u000d\u000aclasses live into English so that non-native students could have live written input as well as the\u000d\u000aaudio input from the lecturers. The first experiments proved extremely successful and promising\u000d\u000awith a view to extending this technique to other universities around the country.\u000d\u000aIn the UK, until 2009 respeaking had only been used on TV. In collaboration with Romero-Fresco\u000d\u000aand using the initial findings of the DTV4ALL project, the subtitling company Stagetext piloted in\u000d\u000aMarch 2009 the first experience of respoken subtitles for a live event in the UK (a talk at the\u000d\u000aNational Gallery). Since then, Stagetext has been providing regular access for deaf and hard-of-\u000d\u000ahearing people to 100 live events every year at museums and theatres all around the country.\u000d\u000aFinally, Romero-Fresco's research is also being applied in the UK by Bee Communications and Ai-\u000d\u000aLive. Bee Communications are using Romero-Fresco's training programme and the NER model for\u000d\u000athe pioneering application of respeaking to telephone conversations. The goal is to enable people\u000d\u000awith hearing loss to read on their phone screens what their interlocutor is saying. In the UK, this\u000d\u000ahas normally been done by a remote typist, but never by a respeaker. As for Ai-Live, they are\u000d\u000aworking with Romero-Fresco and using both his training programme and the NER model to\u000d\u000aintroduce respeaking in UK secondary schools. The aim in this case is to use respeaking to\u000d\u000aprovide a live transcription of the teacher's words in the classroom for the benefit of students with\u000d\u000ahearing loss or learning difficulties.\u000d\u000aOngoing\u000d\u000aWith regard to ongoing developments, Romero-Fresco is now working as a consultant in the EU-\u000d\u000afunded project SAVAS, which aims to develop speech recognition software in languages that still\u000d\u000ado not have this technology. The project will be using the NER model to develop new software in\u000d\u000aPortuguese and in minority languages such as Basque and Galician, in order to ensure that the\u000d\u000ahearing-impaired viewers from these countries and regions can have access to live programmes\u000d\u000aand public events through respeaking.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aSince 2008, drawing on the findings of the EU-funded project Digital TV for ALL (2008-2011) and\u000d\u000aon his book Subtitling through Speech Recognition: Respeaking (2011), Dr Pablo Romero-Fresco\u000d\u000ahas researched and promoted a new technique to guarantee that deaf and hard-of-hearing people\u000d\u000aaround the world can have access to live programmes and public events through speech\u000d\u000arecognition-based subtitles.

Respeaking, a technique whereby a subtitler paraphrases the\u000d\u000aspeech of a live programme to speech-recognition software in order to produce live subtitles for\u000d\u000adeaf and hard of hearing viewers, is considered as a new modality of media accessibility. It was\u000d\u000afirst used by the BBC in 2001, but had not been the subject of academic research until 2008. Since\u000d\u000a2008 Romero-Fresco (Lecturer 2008-2010, Senior Lecturer 2010-2012, Reader 2012-2013) has\u000d\u000abeen conducting research to promote and improve the provision of live subtitles through\u000d\u000arespeaking for deaf and hard-of-hearing people around the world.\u000d\u000aAs project manager of the subtitling part of Digital TV for All (2008-2011), a project on media\u000d\u000aaccessibility funded by the EU Commission, Romero-Fresco coordinated the work of researchers\u000d\u000afrom the UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, Poland, Denmark and France on the quality of subtitling in\u000d\u000aEurope. Romero-Fresco was also the researcher in charge of conducting the DTV4ALL study in\u000d\u000athe UK, which provided the findings for this case study. Romero-Fresco's research contribution to\u000d\u000athe project dealt with live subtitling and resulted in the monograph Subtitling through Speech\u000d\u000aRecognition: Respeaking (2011), the first book ever written on the subject. The first part of the\u000d\u000abook set the terminology for the new respeaking discipline. In the case of the Spanish language, it\u000d\u000acoined the Spanish term for respeaking (rehablado), which was officially accepted by the Royal\u000d\u000aSpanish Academy of the Language in 2011 and has now become the standard term used by the\u000d\u000aindustry, the media and the public to refer to this discipline. This book and the article \"Respeaking\u000d\u000ain Translator Training Curricula\" (2012) also outlined the first theoretical and practical training\u000d\u000aprogramme for respeakers, which has been used by universities, media companies and\u000d\u000abroadcasters around the world.\u000d\u000aDrawing on the data obtained by Romero-Fresco in the UK as part of the DTV4ALL Project, his\u000d\u000a2011 book also presented the first reception study ever made on live subtitling, providing data on\u000d\u000athe viewers' preferences, comprehension and physical perception of live subtitles. The viewers'\u000d\u000apreferences were obtained through a large survey conducted in collaboration with the Royal\u000d\u000aNational Institute for the Deaf. The results of the survey showed the need to raise awareness about\u000d\u000arespeaking in the UK, since many viewers were not aware of the existence of live subtitles and\u000d\u000aothers had unrealistic expectations about them because they were not familiar with the complexity\u000d\u000ainvolved in respeaking. The study on comprehension and perception of live subtitles in the UK\u000d\u000aapplied, for the first time ever, eye-tracking technology to determine how viewers process subtitles\u000d\u000ain live programmes. The findings of this study suggest that the word-for-word display mode of live\u000d\u000asubtitles prevents viewers from achieving an optimum comprehension of the TV programmes.\u000d\u000aFinally, the last part of Romero-Fresco's 2011 book introduces the first model with metrics to\u000d\u000aanalyse the quality of live subtitles. The model accounts for the different parameters that affect the\u000d\u000aquality of live subtitles and is designed to provide feedback for the companies (about the accuracy\u000d\u000aof their subtitles), the respeakers (about what aspects they need improve in order to obtain better\u000d\u000aresults) and the viewers (about how their comprehension may be affected by the lack of accuracy\u000d\u000ain the subtitles).\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"20471","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"49518","Name":"Rwanda"},{"GeoNamesId":"831053","Name":"Kosovo"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The socio-cognitive framework has been foundational in the benchmarking\u000d\u000a      of existing tests and test design on an international scale.

The Secretariat of Public Education in Mexico now accredits the\u000d\u000a      tests for national use, and the impact of the research was two-fold.\u000d\u000a      Firstly, the tests were made culturally appropriate for the people of\u000d\u000a      Central and South America, and secondly, they cost less than one fifth of\u000d\u000a      equivalent assessments making them much more accessible to local people.\u000d\u000a    The development of an advanced level test for the International Council\u000d\u000a      of Ophthalmologists (2009-10) is one example that demonstrates the impact\u000d\u000a      of the framework and the associated benefits for test takers. Through the\u000d\u000a      research, the test was developed for specific-subject knowledge in\u000d\u000a      English, and tested particularly for both precision and accuracy, which\u000d\u000a      were seen as important characteristics for professional competency. The\u000d\u000a      successful completion of the test now leads to recognition as a Fellow of\u000d\u000a      the International Council of Ophthalmology, and is recognised as a\u000d\u000a      \"revolutionary examination\" (Taylor and Quilter, 2011: 2).\u000d\u000a    Growing pressures for those operating English language tests to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate validity have resulted in a series of commissioned projects in\u000d\u000a      which the framework has been applied to ensure that the tests are\u000d\u000a      appropriate and useful to the needs of examiners and testers. Examples\u000d\u000a      which have been underpinned by the socio-cognitive framework since 2008\u000d\u000a      include Cambridge ESOL, and a range of examination boards that required\u000d\u000a      their tests to be theoretically linked to the Common European Framework\u000d\u000a      (CEFR), in the UK, Turkey, Mexico, Taiwan and Japan. The benchmarking of\u000d\u000a      City and Guilds English language tests (2008-9), in line with the CEFR, is\u000d\u000a      one example that has been completed by O'Sullivan. This project critically\u000d\u000a      reviewed City and Guilds examination in the light of the socio-cognitive\u000d\u000a      framework, reworking test specifications and empirically benchmarking\u000d\u000a      against CEFR criteria. This was vital for the recognition of these exams.\u000d\u000a      Moreover, the reports, recommendations and reviewing framework provided\u000d\u000a      the expert advice required to navigate the changing policy environment and\u000d\u000a      steer the continuing professional development of the organization. The\u000d\u000a      project is now registered with the Council of Europe as one of the\u000d\u000a      official linking projects.\u000d\u000a    A further example of the application of the socio-cognitive framework is\u000d\u000a      the development of the International Language Assessment (ILA), in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with CRELLA at the University of Bedfordshire, for the\u000d\u000a      British Council (2007-9). This innovative assessment tool measures levels\u000d\u000a      of English so that learners can continue their language learning at the\u000d\u000a      appropriate stage. Not only does it ensure that students are able to\u000d\u000a      register for the appropriate level of English language instruction, but it\u000d\u000a      is also an affordable test. In the Ukraine, for example, it costs less\u000d\u000a      than &#163;4 (50UAH). O'Sullivan continues to work on the ILA, monitoring the\u000d\u000a      test and conducting analyses of results by country as requested. The\u000d\u000a      300,000+ individuals who have taken the ILA test, to date, indicate the reach\u000d\u000a      of this impact.\u000d\u000a    2) The development and delivery of APTIS with the British Council:\u000d\u000a    Since 2012 O'Sullivan has worked with the British Council as the Senior\u000d\u000a      Advisor for English Language Assessment. O'Sullivan is driving the\u000d\u000a      application of the socio-cognitive framework on a much wider scale and\u000d\u000a      innovation in the development of a new testing system. The significance\u000d\u000a      of the research is demonstrated by the British Council's recognition of\u000d\u000a      the framework as `the most influential test validation theory in modern\u000d\u000a      assessment' (http:\/\/www.britishcouncil.org\/exams\/aptis\/research).\u000a      O'Sullivan's version of the socio-cognitive framework has now been\u000d\u000a      formally adopted by the British Council and is currently being developed\u000d\u000a      for use in teaching as well as in relation to assessment. This research\u000d\u000a      has had a significant impact on the British Council, as the\u000d\u000a      organisation now has an agreed approach to language assessment, which is\u000d\u000a      underpinned by a coherent philosophy and approach built on the\u000d\u000a      socio-cognitive framework. This has acted as the foundation stone for a\u000d\u000a      new direction in the organisational approach to the development of testing\u000d\u000a      products.\u000d\u000a    This change is evident in the development of a new `testing system',\u000d\u000a      APTIS, which is underpinned by the socio-cognitive framework. This is the\u000d\u000a      first time the British Council has developed its own testing products,\u000d\u000a      rather than acting as the distributor of other products. As a result there\u000d\u000a      have been tangible economic benefits, as the product has created a significant\u000d\u000a      new revenue stream. The APTIS service is a business-to-business product\u000d\u000a      that is both flexible and accessible providing the British Council with an\u000d\u000a      innovative and highly marketable English Language testing system. Because\u000d\u000a      of its innovative modular structure, adaptable delivery system and\u000d\u000a      customizable content, the APTIS service is appropriate for a wide range of\u000d\u000a      contexts. Launched globally in August 2012, APTIS helps organisations\u000d\u000a      benchmark and assess the English language skills of their employees,\u000d\u000a      prospective employees, students and teachers. The test can also be used to\u000d\u000a      conduct `language audits' to identify language training and development\u000d\u000a      needs.\u000d\u000a    The benefits of the APTIS service which are underpinned by the framework\u000d\u000a      are that 1) it can be completed quickly (a maximum of seventy-two, and\u000d\u000a      normally twenty-four hours) and, 2) it is affordable (&#163;30 for the four\u000d\u000a      skill test), which means that organisations are able to bear the cost. It\u000d\u000a      is a modular system, with 15 different configurations of four fundamental\u000d\u000a      elements (reading, writing, speaking, listening). Clients can choose\u000d\u000a      precisely what they need to assess and tailor components to local\u000d\u000a      contexts. The system is also innovative in its delivery as it can be taken\u000d\u000a      over the phone, on computer, or with pen and paper. This key development\u000d\u000a      means that the test is suitable for a much wider range of applications\u000d\u000a      than traditional instruments and that it can be used to access even remote\u000d\u000a      and isolated communities.\u000d\u000a    The reach of this impact between the launch of the product in\u000d\u000a      2012 and 31 July 2013 is indicated by the 90,000 individuals who have\u000d\u000a      taken the test, and its usage in over 40 countries, and a range of\u000d\u000a      contexts including: a DFiD funded project in Rwanda, to assess English\u000d\u000a      teachers' baseline competencies; the Malaysian Education Ministry, for the\u000d\u000a      development of English language assessment and teacher training; Adecco in\u000d\u000a      Poland, for recruitment purposes; the Universidad Cat&#243;lica de Oriente in\u000d\u000a      Columbia to evaluate graduating students' English; Ci&#234;ncia Sem Fronteiras\u000d\u000a      (Science without Frontiers) Brazil, as a gateway to this programme, which\u000d\u000a      facilitates the international training and mobility of science students;\u000d\u000a      Petrobras, Tanzania, to assess training needs; the Ministry of Foreign\u000d\u000a      Affairs, Republic of Kosovo, for recruitment of foreign diplomats and\u000d\u000a      consular staff; the Universidad de Alcal&#225; de Henares, in Spain, to\u000d\u000a      evaluate students' English. In Egypt, it is used by Pfizer and KPMG, in\u000d\u000a      Hungary by MPS Group Henkel and in Brazil by Siemens.\u000d\u000a    The reach of the APTIS product continues to grow, and will also\u000d\u000a      contribute to the refinement and development of the socio-cognitive\u000d\u000a      framework.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study details the impact of a pioneering theoretical approach\u000d\u000a      to English language testing.

It\u000d\u000a      is an innovative perspective that puts the test taker at the heart of\u000d\u000a      assessment theory and practice. This led, in 2001, to the development by\u000d\u000a      Professor Cyril Weir (Professor, 2000-5) and later the operationalization\u000d\u000a      and refinement by Professor Barry O'Sullivan (Reader 2003-, Prof. 2007-12)\u000d\u000a      of the first validation framework (published by Weir, 2005).\u000d\u000a    This model was further refined in the field during the EXAVER project\u000d\u000a      (Universidad Veracruzana, Mexico) and QUALSPELL project (Quality Assurance\u000d\u000a      in Language for Specific Purposes, Tallin Technical University, Estonia\u000d\u000a      2002-4), resulting in a framework that is not only theoretically robust\u000d\u000a      but also practically useful. While other validation theories existed, they\u000d\u000a      were difficult to operationalize and thus of limited use in the\u000d\u000a      development of tests. Refinement and operationalization of the underlying\u000d\u000a      model continued, with an updated version and rationale published\u000d\u000a      (O'Sullivan, 2011a).\u000d\u000a    The socio-cognitive framework identifies and comprehensively defines\u000d\u000a      three key elements: the candidate's cognitive and linguistic resources;\u000d\u000a      the test system, which reflects social and performance variables of the\u000d\u000a      tasks; and the scoring system, which is theoretically linked to the two\u000d\u000a      other elements of the framework. The framework incorporates both the\u000d\u000a      social and cognitive aspects of language and the interaction between the\u000d\u000a      test taker and the test system, including both test tasks and test\u000d\u000a      administration (O'Sullivan, 2008). This approach also means that scoring\u000d\u000a      systems are theoretically robust, whilst the detailed definition of the\u000d\u000a      framework elements means they are also operationalisable.\u000d\u000a    The framework focuses on all three aspects of the assessment process\u000d\u000a      (test taker, test instrument, test scoring), and as a result it is highly\u000d\u000a      sensitive to context. O'Sullivan's research argues that this is crucial\u000d\u000a      (2011a) and also results in tests being localised, and specifically\u000d\u000a      appropriate for the populations and skills being assessed (O'Sullivan,\u000d\u000a      2012). Moreover, this attention to context means the framework is highly\u000d\u000a      adaptable. Not only can it be used to test different facets of English\u000d\u000a      language competence, it has also been used to assess subject specific\u000d\u000a      material.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21107","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"69543","Name":"Yemen"},{"GeoNamesId":"286963","Name":"Oman"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The stabilisation or rehabilitation of an endangered language requires\u000d\u000a      processes involving the\u000d\u000a      use of educational, political and social means to increase the number of\u000d\u000a      its speakers.\u000d\u000a      However, revitalisation of an endangered language cannot occur unless the\u000d\u000a      language is first\u000d\u000a      documented.

Census figures give an ethnic Mehri population of c.\u000d\u000a        180,000, but this belies\u000d\u000a        the linguistic situation: as a MSAL, Mehri is neither written nor a\u000d\u000a        language of the media.\u000d\u000a        The prestige of Arabic coupled with urban migration has led to many\u000d\u000a        Mehris losing\u000d\u000a        competence in Mehri; even those living in remote villages are becoming\u000d\u000a        increasingly\u000d\u000a        bilingual in Arabic. Schooling is conducted solely in Arabic and\u000d\u000a        children are banned from\u000d\u000a        speaking Mehri on school grounds. Immigration of Yemeni Arabs into the\u000d\u000a        province since\u000d\u000a        unification in 1990 and increasingly in recent years has forced Arabic\u000d\u000a        to be the main\u000d\u000a        language of communication in Mehri towns.\u000d\u000a      Because Mehri is a spoken language, Mehri has not until recently been\u000d\u000a        used in new\u000d\u000a        electronic media such as SMS text messaging and e-mail. Since January\u000d\u000a        2010, Watson\u000d\u000a        has been communicating with Mehri speakers in Mehri using Arabic script\u000d\u000a        in email and\u000d\u000a        SMS text messaging. Watson has encouraged language consultants to use\u000d\u000a        Arabic script in\u000d\u000a        order to communicate Mehri data in text messages and emails.\u000d\u000a      Between January 2010 and July 2012, Watson has built up a database of\u000d\u000a        over 3,800 SMS\u000d\u000a        messages. This has created a new cultural phenomenon in which Mehri\u000d\u000a        speakers adapt\u000d\u000a        the script with which they are accustomed (Arabic) in order to use Mehri\u000d\u000a        in electronic\u000d\u000a        communication.\u000d\u000a      Watson's research on the sound structure of Mehri and Yemeni Arabic\u000d\u000a        has resulted in a\u000d\u000a        corpus of publicly accessible sound files\u000d\u000a        (http:\/\/www.semarch.unihd.de\/index.php43?LD_ID=5&amp;lang=en).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The project has generated incremental impact in attracting additional\u000d\u000a      funding for extension of\u000d\u000a      the innovative research methodology, with an award of &#163;149,680 from the\u000d\u000a      Leverhulme Trust to\u000d\u000a      develop the documentation and linguistic analysis of Sheret, Harsusi,\u000d\u000a      Hobyot and Bathari.

The numbers of non-\/limited-English\u000a        speakers in the\u000a        region have also increased as a result\u000a          of EEA nationals coming into the region.\u000a      Research carried out with local statutory and non-statutory service\u000a        providers has shown\u000a        that changes to criteria for service eligibility (e.g. in adult social\u000a        care) and difficulties for\u000a        some EEA nationals in passing the Habitual Residence Test has in some\u000a        cases led to\u000a        homelessness and destitution (as reported by Rainbow Haven), leading to\u000a        increased\u000a        pressure on third sector organisations to provide welfare assistance,\u000a        often in the absence\u000a        of or reduction in funding for interpreting services.

The CAT provides therapists with a unique, comprehensive, single\u000a      test which gives a profile of relative strengths and weaknesses in\u000a      patients' language processing; a way of assessing how other cognitive\u000a      difficulties are impacting on their language, the likely course of\u000a      recovery, and a means to assess how their aphasia impacts on their lives.\u000a      At its publication, it was embedded within current theoretical\u000a      understanding and continues to be accessible to clinicians. The CAT is now\u000a      widely used in the UK and internationally by Speech and Language\u000a      Therapists (SLTs) and researchers working with people with aphasia. The\u000a      accessible format of the test and the comprehensive information obtained\u000a      has resulted in its translation into a number of languages and its use in\u000a      clinical trials and research projects.\u000a    1. CAT sales\/Distribution\u000a    Although there is a restricted market for tests such as these, the CAT\u000a      has sold over 1600 copies worldwide (1459 of these sales since 2008) with\u000a      significant sales in the UK and in other English speaking nations\u000a      (Ireland\/Australia\/US) (IMP1). In 2003 Code and Heron identified\u000a      224 relevant SLT departments (i.e. working with an adult neurogenic\u000a      population) in the UK. These may have more than one therapist within them,\u000a      but it is common practice for one copy of an assessment to be bought for\u000a      one department. In addition there are SLT training courses (n=22) in the\u000a      UK and Ireland, researchers and a limited number of independent\u000a      clinicians. With this in mind, CAT sales represent considerable reach.\u000a      Following the development of the CAT, other researchers developed software\u000a      to facilitate the scoring\/interpretation of data (IMP2); this\u000a      development reflects the widespread use of the CAT and the software has\u000a      already sold approx. 90 copies since its publication in 2011. The\u000a      accessible format and comprehensive information has resulted in the test\u000a      being translated into Arabic and there is on-going work on a Dutch\/Flemish\u000a      and Spanish version, allowing the test to be used with non-English\u000a      speakers. Given the extensive time, resources and expertise that are\u000a      needed to translate CAT into different languages, this is indicative of\u000a      CAT's significance for clinical practice and its value to practitioners (IMP3).\u000a      The continued sales, use of existing tests and on-going translations\u000a      ensure current and future impact for clinicians and the patients they work\u000a      with.\u000a    2. Impact on Speech and Language Therapists\u000a    Clinicians require a tool which facilitates rapid and reliable diagnosis\u000a      of aphasia. Early reviews of CAT acknowledged the advantages set out by\u000a      the authors, recognising the test as theoretically well-constructed and\u000a      clinically feasible and as a useful tool for `targeting therapy towards\u000a      specific goals, which take due consideration of both the impairment and\u000a      the participation level associated with aphasia' (p78i). It was identified\u000a      as a valuable development in aphasia testing, `useful in diagnosing the\u000a      individual's impairment, assessing the overall severity of the language\u000a      disorder and predicting and following changes in the severity of aphasia\u000a      over time' (p89ii) (IMP4). The `Disability Questionnaire' (DQ) (a\u000a      section within the CAT) was one of the first objective measures of the\u000a      wider impact of aphasia within the WHO framework of impairment, activity\u000a      and participation. Concepts from the DQ have been taken forward within a\u000a      more recent assessment, the Communication Disability Profile, and its\u000a      authors describe the DQ as its `forerunner'. The popularity of the CAT and\u000a      interest about its psychometric properties is reflected in the fact that\u000a      the 2010 article is one of the most read (top ten) Aphasiology articles\u000a      accessed on-line (April 2013) (IMP5); Aphasiology is the foremost\u000a      journal read by clinicians and researchers interested in language\u000a      difficulties resulting from brain damage.\u000a    Whether the reported benefits of CAT had resulted in changes to clinical\u000a      practice was considered via a focus group of SLTs in the North East of\u000a      England (IMP6) and a survey to aphasia clinicians and researchers\u000a      (IMP7). The focus group was led by 2 independent researchers and\u000a      was part of a normal meeting of a specialist group of SLTs working with\u000a      people with aphasia in hospitals and in community settings (May 2013). 17\u000a      people attended the meeting. Two groups considered questions about their\u000a      use of the CAT, the sub-tests used, its strengths and weaknesses and its\u000a      benefits to them and their patients, in the context of a wider discussion\u000a      about current assessment practice. Within the focus group, people reported\u000a      using the CAT (or sub-tests of it) as a starting point, guiding further\u000a      more detailed assessment, particularly in a community setting. SLTs\u000a      described using the results to inform diagnosis, direct further\u000a      assessment, inform intervention and monitor overall progress across the\u000a      aphasia pathway. The comprehensive nature of the CAT was considered its\u000a      main strength, with therapists also reporting that it was easy to use and\u000a      had clear instructions and scoring rules. Some individuals reported that\u000a      it had benefited their practice\/client care by providing a `rounded'\u000a      picture of clients' strengths and weaknesses (not just focusing on\u000a      impairment\/less chance of missing subtle impairments) and facilitating a\u000a      smoother transition between different therapists (IMP6).\u000a    A survey was designed to consider the use and utility of language\u000a      assessment in aphasia. People were asked about their work with people with\u000a      aphasia, whether formal and informal assessments were used, what formal\u000a      assessments were used and specific questions about the usefulness of a\u000a      range of common assessments including the CAT. The survey was sent out via\u000a      two independent researchers to mailing lists of specialist aphasia\u000a      clinicians nationally and internationally. 243 responses were received; a\u000a      high return rate considering the small number of potential recipients. 68%\u000a      of respondents were based in the UK, with a range of postcodes reflecting\u000a      national coverage. 32% of respondents were based internationally\u000a      (including Finland, USA, Singapore, and Germany) with a high number from\u000a      Australia and Ireland. Respondents were primarily clinicians with\u000a      extensive experience (5-10 years or more) of working with people with\u000a      aphasia (IMP7).\u000a    The survey revealed that over 80% of respondents were using the CAT (in\u000a      whole or part) with an additional 10% reporting they would use if\u000a      available. Over 75% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the CAT\u000a      had `benefitted me as a therapist' and that it `yields useful information\u000a      which helps in diagnosis', `yields useful information which helps in goals\u000a      setting' and `yields useful information which helps in planning\u000a      treatment'. The majority of participants were using sub-tests of CAT\u000a      rather than using the test in its entirety. The benefits highlighted by\u000a      individual respondents replicated those identified by the authors,\u000a      reviewers and participants in the focus group: standardised,\u000a      well-researched, quick and easy to use, comprehensive overview of\u000a      strengths and weaknesses. Some of the benefits to people with aphasia were\u000a      identified as: gives patient and family a realistic understanding of\u000a      strengths and weaknesses, easy to use and easy to show outcomes.\u000a      Respondents were using a range of other assessments alongside CAT, often\u000a      to use sub-tests with more items or that allowed increased consideration\u000a      of errors. There were a number of comments that suggested that the\u000a      addition of CAT had changed their assessment practice. For example, \"I\u000a        rarely use this (BDAE) now, preferring the CAT. I do sometimes use\u000a        yes\/no questions\"; and \"[PALPA provides] info on linguistic\u000a        variables that help identify nature of the impairment and therapy\u000a        planning, can be a next step if isolated difficulty on CAT but I use far\u000a        less since CAT published\". The focus group and survey results show\u000a      that the proposed use and advantages of the CAT are reflected in current\u000a      clinical practice (IMP7).\u000a    An additional survey was sent to all of the SLT educational\u000a      establishments in the UK and Ireland (n= 22). As with the main survey, the\u000a      questionnaire asked about the CAT within the context of questions about\u000a      other aphasia assessments, looking at student familiarity with\u000a      assessments, their contribution to student learning, and the utility of\u000a      the assessment. 12 responses were received, including both undergraduate\u000a      and postgraduate courses. All of the respondents said that students will\u000a      be familiar with CAT both in the classroom and clinical practice. In\u000a      addition, all of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the CAT\u000a      `contributes to student learning and knowledge of aphasia'. One respondent\u000a      stated \"based on the cognitive neuropsychological model, it can help\u000a        students come to grips with the model and practical aspects of clinical\u000a        assessment\". Student familiarity with and use of the CAT means that\u000a      the impact of CAT on clinical practice will continue to strengthen as the\u000a      new generation of SLTs enter practice. The utility of CAT in assessment\u000a      and diagnosis was reinforced by respondents, for example, \"[It] allows\u000a        the student to consider the main aspects of aphasia that need to be\u000a        assessed, facilitates practice in obtaining a picture of client\u000a        difficulties and abilities and sign-posts where further assessment is\u000a        needed to gain a more indepth language profile, practice in differential\u000a        diagnosis...\" (IMP8).\u000a    3. Wider clinical impact\u000a    The comprehensive nature, reliability and validity of the CAT have made\u000a      it one of the first choices for research studies about people with\u000a      aphasia. Aphasia therapy research is at a transitional stage, moving from\u000a      a weaker evidence base (single case studies, case series) to a more robust\u000a      base of group studies and randomised control trials. Diagnostically, the\u000a      CAT has been used in many recent single case studies and case series,\u000a      providing a language profile for participants, allowing clinicians to\u000a      select effective treatments for individuals with a similar profile. Of\u000a      greater significance, the CAT is currently being used as the outcome\u000a      measure in a number of larger trials. For example, `Aphasia Language and\u000a      Functional Intervention (LIFT), Australia, and `Programme for Intensive\u000a      Residential Aphasia Treatment' (PIRATE), U.S.A. (IMP9). These\u000a      studies are crucial for continuing to develop the evidence base for the\u000a      benefits of speech and language therapy for people with aphasia and will\u000a      influence clinical practice. The CAT is also been used by a team of\u000a      researchers creating a database of people with aphasia containing\u000a      information about their language and cognitive skills and linking this to\u000a      the site of their brain lesion, with the ultimate aim of making\u000a      predictions about recovery (IMP10). This is an innovative and\u000a      ambitious study, using the CAT as the primary assessment method. This\u000a      project is of importance to the field as better information about likely\u000a      prognosis will be of great clinical significance.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The CAT is a unique clinical assessment for people with aphasia,\u000a      combining assessment of language, cognitive skills and consideration of\u000a      the wider effects of aphasia on people's lives. On publication, it filled\u000a      a gap in provision, providing a short but comprehensive assessment based\u000a      on current theoretical understanding. It is now widely used by Speech and\u000a      Language Therapists nationally and internationally, directing further\u000a      assessment and informing diagnosis and treatment and therefore of benefit\u000a      to people with aphasia.

Prior to the\u000a      publication of CAT, Speech and Language Therapists (SLTs) working with\u000a      people with aphasia had to use large scale assessment batteries based on\u000a      research predominantly from the 1970's or a collection of theoretically\u000a      motivated tests (e.g. PALPA (Psycholinguistic Assessments of Language\u000a      Processing in Aphasia)) which, whilst very useful, were never designed to\u000a      be completed in full and required both time and extensive clinician skill\u000a      in both selection and interpretation. The CAT represented a unique\u000a      contribution to the field, allowing clinicians to assess people with\u000a      aphasia with one test, carefully designed and based on current theoretical\u000a      advances, which could be administered in its entirety to provide a clear\u000a      profile of the person's aphasia and its impact.\u000a    The Comprehensive Aphasia Test (1) was developed over the period\u000a      1995-2003. CAT was a collaboration between David Howard (Research\u000a      Development Professor, 1996 to current), Kate Swinburn (from Connect: a\u000a      charity for people with aphasia), and Gillian Porter (an NHS therapist\u000a      from Hertfordshire). The CAT was an innovation in aphasia assessment,\u000a      uniquely drawing on both the increasing cognitive neuropsychological\u000a      understanding of the factors that underlie the language difficulties of\u000a      people with aphasia, and the need to consider the wider impacts of aphasia\u000a      on people's lives (based on principles of the World Health Organisation\u000a      (WHO) International Classification Framework). The CAT aimed to draw\u000a      together all relevant aspects of current research; this included\u000a      longstanding contributions Howard had made to the field (examples include\u000a      4, 5), particularly in relation to word retrieval as well as\u000a      external research. Development of the CAT was a collaborative process,\u000a      with Howard's particular contributions leading on the design and\u000a      subsequent analysis of the psychometric properties of the test, ensuring\u000a      that the methods used allowed analysis of its reliability, validity and\u000a      predictive power.\u000a    The authors identify the advantages of the CAT as: i) Being\u000a      comprehensive, as it assesses a wide range of language and\u000a      neuropsychological impairments and the effect of the language impairment\u000a      from the patient's perspective; ii) Being clinically useful because it is\u000a      brief; iii) Being a means of monitoring recovery and outcome; and iv)\u000a      Being psychometrically well constructed in terms of reliability and\u000a      validity (construct, predictive and concurrent) (2, 3).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21715","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research delivered the first concrete and specific\u000a      insights into service organisation, content and provision for pwP.\u000a      Crucially, the research has been able to directly influence and inform\u000a      government and professional body aims, policies and guidelines, as well as\u000a      contributing to the education and training of professionals. The research\u000a      has also informed resources for pwP and their carers. The research has\u000a      therefore contributed to the wellbeing of pwP in the UK and across Europe.\u000a    Influencing and Informing Government and Professional Body Aims,\u000a        Policies and Guidelines\u000a    Drawing on research findings, the lead researcher Miller has presented\u000a      evidence to parliamentary enquires and committees. For example, as a\u000a      result of giving evidence to the All Party\u000a     Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Parkinson's Disease, the research was\u000a      cited multiple times in the final report on Parkinson's Disease services.\u000a      This report identified significant barriers and inequalities in service\u000a      access and made a number of key recommendations. Research insights were\u000a      used to provide evidence in relation to palliative and end of life care,\u000a      inadequacies in the experience and expertise of key professionals,\u000a      including training issues, and inequalities in access to speech and\u000a      language therapy provision. For example, the report states \"Dr Nick\u000a        Miller provided evidence about the importance of seeing patients from\u000a        the point of diagnosis to prevent, or delay, many serious complications\u000a        that may be experienced by people in the later stages of Parkinson's\u000a        disease, such as swallowing problems and malnutrition, as well as speech\u000a        problems. However his research findings highlighted major shortfalls in\u000a        preventative interventions\" (pp8-9) (IMP1).\u000a    As a result of the research, Miller has been invited and appointed to\u000a      join key committees. For example, in 2009 Miller was invited to join a\u000a      committee to oversee the implementation of National Institute for Health\u000a      and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Guidelines for Parkinson's UK (PUK) (a\u000a      national patient advocacy organisation). He was also invited onto a\u000a      further audit steering committee that was set up to implement, in\u000a      cooperation with professional bodies (e.g. Royal College of Speech and\u000a      Language Therapists (RCSLT); British Geriatric Society), an annual\u000a      national audit of services of the management of pwP to monitor change in\u000a      services. The annual audits help healthcare organisations measure their\u000a      services against NICE guidelines and aids them in improving and developing\u000a      their services for pwP, as part of the wider improvement agenda. Miller\u000a      had direct input into the audit tools for medical services, which drew\u000a      directly from the underpinning research process. Leading figures from PUK\u000a      confirmed that \"We were able to draw directly on Nick Miller's research\u000a        and input to achieve this. This tool has in the meantime been fully\u000a        implemented across the NHS and is delivering valuable data for\u000a        Parkinson's UK in driving up standards of services for people with\u000a        Parkinson's and has been praised by users as a tool that directly\u000a        facilitates review and improvement of their clinical services\" (IMP2).\u000a      Following the success of the above tool, Miller was also selected as\u000a      specific lead for the speech-language therapy tool and \"his research\u000a        work in already conducting national surveys of service user and provider\u000a        issues for people with Parkinson's was invaluable in this respect\".\u000a      The SLT tool \"has received very positive feedback as a method to\u000a        benchmark and improve services\" (IMP2).\u000a    Findings from the research have been incorporated into guidelines\u000a      nationally and internationally. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines\u000a      Network (SIGN), which develops evidence-based clinical practice guidelines\u000a      for NHS Scotland, cited the research in its national clinical guideline\u000a      (2010) in the sections on Communication and Non-Motor Symptoms (IMP3).\u000a      The Dutch ParkinsonNet (Dutch patient advocacy organisation) guidelines,\u000a      which are highly regarded internationally, draw on the research to provide\u000a      support for everyday clinical practice. Citing the research findings, the\u000a      guidelines highlight the need for more in-depth assessments beyond the\u000a      sole use of checklists, as Parkinson's can have an impact on swallowing\u000a      and communication behaviour even if the patient looks like they are doing\u000a      satisfactorily on the surface (IMP4). The relevance of the\u000a      research to clinical practice is also reflected in Miller's role as\u000a      national advisor to the RCSLT. RCSLT's Head of Professional Development\u000a      confirmed that: \"[Miller] has supported the work of the RCSLT over many\u000a        years and his research work continues to have an impact on clinical\u000a        practice. He made a significant contribution to 'Communicating Quality\u000a        3' (the RCSLT's professional standards publication) by\u000a        authoring\/co-authoring three chapters. Whilst published in 2006 this\u000a        continues to support the practice of the SLT profession [...]\u000a        Through his role as national adviser for acquired neurological disorders\u000a        (in particular motor speech disorders), he regularly provides up to\u000a        date, evidence based information to our members. This information\u000a        supports clinical decision making in practice. Professor Miller is\u000a        contacted regularly on behalf of our members due to his in-depth\u000a        knowledge and expertise in his field\" (IMP5).\u000a    Contributing to Education and Training of Professionals and Informing\u000a        Resources for pwP\u000a    Insights from the research have been used to inform education, training,\u000a      clinical practice and resources for pwP. For example, Miller used the\u000a      research to contribute to the British Medical Journal Continuing Medical\u000a      Education Programme, BMJ Learning, on the module `Common Speech\u000a      and Language Disorders in Adults: an Overview'. This module is taken by a\u000a      wide range of medical professionals and is accredited by Professional\u000a      Bodies worldwide, for example, the Austrian Academy of Physicians and the\u000a      Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (IMP6). An\u000a      Erasmus project has used research findings as recommendations for teaching\u000a      programme content and benchmarks in Speech Language Therapy courses in\u000a      Europe, such as a post-qualifying specialisation course, `European\u000a      Clinical Specialisation in Motor Speech Disorders' (IMP7). Drawing\u000a      directly on the research, Miller has delivered webcasts and podcasts. For\u000a      example, his video podcast for healthcare professionals on the Special\u000a      Interest Group Neurology section of the GlaxoSmithKline website offers an\u000a      overview of the types and extent of changes in communication associated\u000a      with Parkinson's and outlines some issues and practices in intervention to\u000a      support people with Parkinson's who experience such changes (IMP8).\u000a      Miller has also been invited to address\/train colleagues on the issues at\u000a      workshops in many countries.\u000a    The research has informed the content of publications and services to\u000a      support both professionals and pwP. Several PUK information sheets which\u000a      focus on swallowing, saliva control, communication, speech, voice and\u000a      language, drew on the research and are available in hard copy for clinics\u000a      and online for professionals and service users worldwide (IMP2,9).\u000a      Pre-eminence of the work and Miller's international expertise in this\u000a      field was also acknowledged in late 2010 when he was chosen to be the\u000a      `resident' expert on the PUK web-based `ask the expert' site where people\u000a      from around the world can write in with their questions about any aspects\u000a      of the field (IMP2,10). Miller has also been involved in several\u000a      radio and TV broadcasts in the UK and other countries around the topic of\u000a      communication and swallowing changes.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The underpinning research delivered the first concrete and specific\u000a      insights into service organisation, content and provision for people with\u000a      Parkinson's (pwP).

Prior to 2000 acoustic and movement aspects of\u000a      changes to speech were relatively well characterised, though little\u000a      empirical research had addressed the vital issues around the impact of\u000a      changes on intelligibility and eating\/drinking and communication and\u000a      swallowing related quality of life. This programme, led by Nick Miller\u000a      (Professor of Motor Speech Disorders, 1994-current), placed pwP at the\u000a      centre of research by describing and quantifying the functional,\u000a      psychosocial consequences of motor and cognitive changes in pwP. The\u000a      results were then applied to the improvement and development of\u000a      speech-language pathology and other services to support pwP.\u000a    Publications have filled key gaps in the international literature on\u000a      aspects of communication change in Parkinson's and its impact on\u000a      individuals and families (1-6). The research was the first to show\u000a      that, even in pwP who score apparently in the `normal' range on clinical\u000a      screening tests, and so would not have been offered support, there are\u000a      significant perceived changes that can impact greatly on the life of the\u000a      pwP and their family (4). Furthermore, the research highlighted\u000a      that one cannot infer from scores on basic motor\/physiological tests of\u000a      speech and communication what the impact of changes might be (3, 4).\u000a      Two key strands of work over the past 10 years underpin the wider research\u000a      programme: (i) The first ever detailed large scale community based studies\u000a      in the world of communication and swallowing changes in people with\u000a      Parkinson's was carried out to establish the extent and nature of changes\u000a      in these neglected areas (3, 4); (ii) The first detailed\u000a      investigation of speech-language therapy services for people with\u000a      Parkinson's was undertaken, covering not just the researcher and\u000a      clinicians' perspective but crucially also that of users (5, 6).\u000a      These quantitative studies were complemented by the first ever large-scale\u000a      in-depth qualitative studies investigating the impact of communication and\u000a      swallowing changes from the point of view of pwP (1, 2). The\u000a      studies delivered the first tangible and specific insights into service\u000a      organisation, content and provision for pwP.\u000a    The studies delivered novel, fundamental data for the wider Parkinson's\u000a      research and clinical community worldwide, charting changes in\u000a      speech\/swallowing and the relationship of changes to progression of\u000a      symptoms in other aspects of Parkinson's. The most significant findings of\u000a      the research that have gone on to have greatest impact concern the\u000a      psychosocial impact of changes and the major implications for intervention\u000a      and support services for pwP. Completing this research has entailed\u000a      development and standardisation of assessments of intelligibility and\u000a      impact for use in clinic with people with Parkinson's and with motor\u000a      speech disorders more generally. Drawing on research insights, Miller is\u000a      engaged with national and international drivers for clinical change. Out\u000a      of the initial work have grown important further strands of investigation\u000a      and engagement. The research was the first to chart longitudinal evolution\u000a      of functional impact of communication changes on the individual with\u000a      Parkinson's. Studies completed or underway are focusing on specific\u000a      aspects of communication change: e.g. alterations to voice and intonation;\u000a      relationship of depression and speech changes in people with Parkinson's;\u000a      characterisation and quantification of vocal tremor in people with\u000a      Parkinson's; use of speech assessments in the differentiation of\u000a      Parkinson's from related disorders; evaluation of treatment approaches for\u000a      voice\/speech and for swallowing\/drooling. The core team is led by Miller\u000a      with colleagues David Burn (neurology), Emma Noble (health services\u000a      research) and Anna Jones (health services research and physiotherapy).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21716","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has informed the direction and focus of a parliamentary\u000a      inquiry, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Speech and Language,\u000a      chaired by Lord Ramsbotham. Lord Ramsbotham who led a parliamentary\u000a      discussion on the issue on January 29th 2013, also confirmed: \"In\u000a        addition to his willingness to advise, based on his deep knowledge and\u000a        understanding of the subject, he (Law) was able to suggest people from\u000a        whom we ought to seek evidence, and topics that we could pursue with\u000a        advantage. We could not have completed our work without him...I can\u000a        think of no better example of how research can be used to impact on\u000a        policy\" (IMP1). Law presented research evidence to the APPG\u000a      and he was identified as a key contributor by the Royal College of Speech\u000a      and Language Therapists (RCSLT). As a result, the underpinning research is\u000a      cited multiple times in the final report (IMP2). The underpinning\u000a      research output (2) was also cited in the RCSLT's response to the\u000a      House of Commons Education Committee in October 2012, to highlight the\u000a      relationship between language delays in children and social disadvantage (IMP3).\u000a      The significance of the RCRP and APPG reports are highlighted by Lord\u000a      Ramsbotham: \"[the reports] were published in time to inform debate on\u000a        the Children and Families Bill...if successfully enacted, these will\u000a        change the life prospects of many young people, for which there is no\u000a        doubt that much of the credit will be due to Professor Law for educating\u000a        members of both Houses of Parliament\" (IMP1).\u000a    The Communication Trust, an umbrella organisation representing more than\u000a      40 charities which have speech and language as a focus of their\u000a      activities, drew directly on the BCRP evidence to develop an interactive\u000a      online database, `What Works'\u000a      www.thecommunicationtrust.org.uk\/schools\/what-works.\u000a      The Director of The Communication Trust, said; \"This landmark research\u000a        is to be welcomed by all those committed to supporting children and\u000a        young people who struggle with communication...The Trust and our\u000a        Communication Consortium is fully committed to ensuring all those who\u000a        work with children and young people with SLCN know how to support them\u000a        and have practical tools to do this... We're working with the Department\u000a        and the research team to disseminate the resources and outcomes of the\u000a        research, including an online database of evidenced interventions to\u000a        support children's communication\" (IMP4).\u000a    The database has also been endorsed by the RCSLT and the organisation's\u000a      Chief Executive was quoted in a Communication Trust Newsletter as saying:\u000a      \"The RCSLT is delighted to have had the opportunity to work with\u000a        partners at The Communication Trust to support the evaluation and\u000a        development of the What Works website. At a time when commissioning of\u000a        services is becoming more complex, any resource that supports this\u000a        process is going to be vital\" (IMP5). Indicating the\u000a      significance of the database, RCSLT's Chief Executive has also confirmed\u000a      that feedback from the membership (12,201 people in the UK) has been\u000a      positive and that \"we believe that the database, to which James Law has\u000a        been so instrumental, has the potential to make a major contribution to\u000a        the development of evidence based services across the UK and beyond\"\u000a      (IMP6).\u000a    The online database aims to support a range of users, including speech\u000a      and language therapists (SLTs), commissioners, teachers, practitioners and\u000a      other specialist staff and draws together the best available evidence in\u000a      an accessible form. It was launched March 2013 and by the 31st\u000a      of July 2013, it had been accessed by a total of 22,700 visitors, with\u000a      49,500 page views (IMP7). 4,200 professionals are already\u000a      registered to use the database. The Professional Director of the\u000a      Communication Trust states that \"The data base is a direct result of\u000a        the research and we have worked closely [with Law] to ensure the\u000a        research information is accessible to the widest audience while not\u000a        losing the robust nature of the content. The data base has been\u000a        important to our sector in providing up to date information on evidenced\u000a        interventions that can apply positively on outcomes for children and\u000a        young people with speech, language and communication needs...the what\u000a        works data base has been incredibly well received across our sector\"\u000a      (IMP7). Feedback from users is positive, and comments left by\u000a      professionals who have accessed the database include:\u000a    \"I've already used information I have found on the database to discuss\u000a        interventions with parents, schools and speech and language therapists.\u000a        I have also found the links to various websites extremely useful and\u000a        have recommended some to parents and EY [early years] practitioners.\u000a        Thank you!\" (Educational Psychologist)\u000a    \"[The database] helps influence our service delivery design; supports\u000a        advocating to commissioners\/our managers for evidence of why we need\u000a        Speech Language Therapy\" (SLT)\u000a    \"Although we have always strived to be evidence based as a profession,\u000a        in the day to day job of a Speech &amp; Language Therapist, there is not\u000a        often time to find this research. Having a database will be a fantastic\u000a        resource when sharing with parents and professionals why we have chosen\u000a        an intervention (or why we have chosen NOT to use something!)\" (SLT)\u000a        (IMP7).\u000a    Significantly the database is funded by the Department of Education\u000a      through to 2017 and the moderating group of which Law is a key member will\u000a      continue to monitor its quality.\u000a    The Communication Trust also cited the research findings as corroborating\u000a      evidence in their case for support for an Early Endowment Foundation grant\u000a      of &#163;967,780, which is funding a new trial based on their programme, Talk\u000a      of the Town (IMP8). The programme \"was developed with the aim\u000a        of providing a framework where evidenced approaches and interventions\u000a        could be dropped into place within the early years, primary and\u000a        secondary school in one community...We were able to take this approach\u000a        and the What Works data base as a foundation to seek further funding to\u000a        test out the approach more robustly and have recently secured a\u000a        significant grant from the Educational Endowment Foundation to run a\u000a        randomised control trial on the approach in 64 primary schools across\u000a        three areas of the country\" (IMP7). In the `Latest News'\u000a      section of their website the Communication Trust noted that: \"the\u000a        underlying interventions supported as part of Talk of the Town are those\u000a        that have been identified through the Better Communication Research\u000a        Programme as having good evidence of impact\" (IMP9).\u000a    The comprehensive review of the relevant research literature in the BCRP\u000a      research also produced a `Communication Supporting Classrooms (CsC)\u000a      Observation Tool' (with supporting guidance) &#8212; one of few such tools that\u000a      are evidence-based (IMP10). The Tool provides professionals with\u000a      the means of profiling the ways in which oral language is supported in\u000a      Reception and Key Stage 1 and 2 classrooms. It has been published on The\u000a      Communication Trust website `Resources for Practitioners'.\u000a    In summary, the underpinning research has significantly informed and\u000a      influenced high level policy makers and professional organisations. In\u000a      particular, the BCRP research was (i) instrumental in placing SLCN on the\u000a      political and policy agenda, and (ii) led directly to the introduction of\u000a      a database of evidenced interventions, aimed at supporting practitioners,\u000a      and a new programme which has produced positive outcomes for schools,\u000a      children and young people.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at Newcastle on speech language and communication needs (SLCN)\u000a      has significantly extended the range and quality of evidence in this\u000a      field.

Many of these children go on to\u000a      struggle with reading and writing and consequently other academic\u000a      subjects. As a result, many underachieve throughout their schooling and\u000a      into the work force.\u000a    Since joining Newcastle, James Law (Professor of Speech and Language\u000a      Science, 2010-present) has built on his ESRC funded project work (funding\u000a      but not publications outwith the current REF period) which looked at adult\u000a      outcomes for school entry language delays (1). This project was\u000a      among the first to confirm the long term consequences of such early delays\u000a      in a very large populations over a long period of time (18,000 between 5\u000a      and 34 years in the British Cohort Study 1970) (2). Social\u000a      disadvantage is one of the main predictors of change in the early years\u000a      from an analysis of the Millennium Cohort Study (3), although\u000a      comparable work on Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children showed\u000a      that for very young children what parents do to promote their child's\u000a      readiness for school is more important that social disadvantage per se (4).\u000a      With the exception of (4) Law led each of these studies, writing\u000a      the original proposals, contributing to the analyses and authoring reports\u000a      and papers.\u000a    Equally important is the development of well evaluated interventions.\u000a      Before being employed at Newcastle, Law was the first author of an\u000a      internationally recognised review of speech and language therapy\u000a      interventions published by the Cochrane Collaboration, which can be\u000a      accessed at http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/14651858.CD004110\/pdf.\u000a      It is very widely cited and contributed to Law's role as PI in a major\u000a      &#163;1.5m research programme funded by the Department for Education in\u000a      England, called the Better Communication Research Programme (BCRP),\u000a      2009-2012 and commissioned as a response to the Bercow review of services\u000a      for children with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN). One\u000a      aspect of this work was identifying the `best evidence' for oral language\u000a      programmes. The research examined the intervention literature related to\u000a      children with primary speech and language difficulties. The evidence was\u000a      drawn together and led to the production of the report, What works:\u000a        Interventions for Children with Speech Language and Communication Needs,\u000a      one of a number of reports from the BCRP project (5). The main\u000a      findings were that whilst over 60 evidence-based interventions are\u000a      available to practitioners, many are not being used in the UK, with some\u000a      practitioners commonly relying on interventions with little underpinning\u000a      evidence. Independently Law has also been contributing to the development\u000a      of the primary evidence base both in the UK and in Australia (6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21718","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research has made a direct contribution to preserving\u000a      and presenting the medieval cultural heritage of the Northern German\u000a      convents. The Protestant female communities who now inhabit these convents\u000a      are keenly interested in learning more about their spiritual and cultural\u000a      heritage, which is present in their everyday life as they are the\u000a      custodians of its medieval buildings, tapestries, archives, libraries and\u000a      art works. The Abbess of Medingen comments on the significance of the\u000a      collaboration with L&#228;hnemann: \"It [the link to academic research] is\u000a        very important for us today and I see it as an obligation, as Medingen\u000a        has always been concerned with both learning and religion, not to lose\u000a        sight of either of these. And with Professor L&#228;hnemann &#8212; it just all\u000a        comes together beautifully; I think this kind of collaboration is a\u000a        highly sustainable model for the future\" (IMP1). The\u000a      research brought significant new insight and knowledge about the period\u000a      and as a result led to a more informed and in some cases considerably\u000a      revised interpretation of their medieval heritage by these communities. As\u000a      a direct result, new knowledge is being used to inform new displays,\u000a      exhibitions and the information shared with the thousands of visitors who\u000a      visit the convents annually (IMP2).\u000a    L&#228;hnemann's engagement with the convents has led to a fruitful chain of\u000a      instruction and knowledge-sharing, as the Abbess of L&#252;ne highlights: \"We\u000a        are of course very curious about our medieval heritage and want to know\u000a        more about the inscriptions and manuscripts. We cannot interpret them\u000a        fully by ourselves and Prof L&#228;hnemann can say much more about them,\u000a        information which we are delighted to make use of, as we will do this\u000a        afternoon when 25 of our voluntary tourist guides meet .... We convent\u000a        residents cannot manage to show the several thousands of visitors per\u000a        year around by ourselves and thus it is important that the guides too\u000a        benefit from Prof L&#228;hnemann's knowledge\" (IMP3).\u000a    This productive collaboration has resulted in an overhaul of convent\u000a      museum exhibitions, websites and brochures for tourist visitors. A tour\u000a      guide at Mariensee describes the benefits of the annual training led by\u000a      L&#228;hnemann as an \"absolute highlight\", expressing the infectious\u000a      enthusiasm with which L&#228;hnemann re-created the environment of a medieval\u000a      scriptorium and the performance of the liturgy in all its materiality: \"...the\u000a        detailed knowledge she shares with us enhances our own general knowledge\u000a        about the history and art treasures of the convent ... In a similar\u000a        manner, we can now pass on our knowledge, something from which school\u000a        classes in particular benefit\" (IMP4).\u000a    Another example where the underpinning research had direct influence is\u000a      in the setting up of a new convent museum at Mariensee in 2007, intended\u000a      to convey basic knowledge of Protestant convents to a broad audience. The\u000a      Abbess of Mariensee confirms that the convent museum \"evolved from a\u000a        suggestion by Prof. L&#228;hnemann\" and added \"...the question of how\u000a        to present the only medieval manuscript [of a prayer book]\u000a        still existing in the convent developed into an intense dialogue. We\u000a        were able to profit from both Prof L&#228;hnemann's research and practical\u000a        knowledge\" (IMP5). Evidence of the transfer of knowledge is\u000a      captured in the production of a bookmark [see image] which has on it the\u000a      translation and contextualisation of a particular passage from this prayer\u000a      book. This emblematic bookmark is distributed not only locally at\u000a      Mariensee but also nationally through the hundreds of visitors who attend\u000a      the Kirchentage [nation-wide Protestant gatherings]. Here\u000a      workshops take place that use the sample prayer on the bookmark to teach\u000a      participants how a medieval nun would have written.\u000a    \u000a   Bookmark based on the prayer book of Odilia von Alden, Abbess of Mariensee\u000a  \u000a    L&#228;hnemann's research is extending its impact further as evidenced by her\u000a      appointment as a consultant for a new project to turn a side chapel in St\u000a      John's, the main church of L&#252;neburg, into an exhibition space to document\u000a      its spiritual heritage. The Lutheran Superintendent of L&#252;neburg describes\u000a      L&#228;hnemann's comments on the fragments of a liturgical manuscript as an \"eye-opener\"\u000a      which \"allow us to re-enact parts of it with our guests and\u000a        those preparing for confirmation and to show them the differences\u000a        between modern and medieval reading\" &#8212; thereby informing their own,\u000a      contemporary, spirituality (IMP6).\u000a    As a direct result of the research being conducted, several of the\u000a      medieval manuscripts from Medingen have now been fully digitised. Through\u000a      a link on the convent website (IMP7) these manuscripts have, as it\u000a      were, been returned to the convent. This \"home coming\" of the manuscripts\u000a      received widespread coverage in the local press. For example, the article\u000a      `Von Medingen nach Michigan. Eine Detektivgeschichte' [`From Medingen to\u000a      Michigan. A Detective Story'] recounts the journey of one medieval\u000a      manuscript from the convents to the United States, and appears in a 4-page\u000a      colour weekend supplement to the Allgemeine Uelzener Zeitung\u000a      (circulation: 16,499) (IMP8).\u000a    Through L&#228;hnemann's collaboration with practitioners, the underpinning\u000a      research has also changed aspects of professional practice. For example,\u000a      the transcription and contextualisation of text fragments enabled two\u000a      textile restorers from the Klosterkammer Hannover [the Board responsible\u000a      for the convents] to gain valuable insights about some small garments. As\u000a      a result, they continue to adopt a more holistic approach in their\u000a      analysis and cataloguing, now working with a range of scholars from other\u000a      disciplines. This collaboration also resulted in a shared publication (4)\u000a      and provoked lively interest at a public presentation in the convent of\u000a      L&#252;ne (IMP10) and when it was featured in the 'Heimatkalender\u000a      Uelzen 2012', the calendar distributed by all local firms to their\u000a      customers as a Christmas gift (IMP9). The collaboration also made\u000a      the national news when subsequently one of the garments was chosen for the\u000a      exhibition 'Rosenkr&#228;nze und Seeleng&#228;rten' to make devotional life in the\u000a      convents tangible to the wider public. This integration of\u000a      state-of-the-art research into a popular exhibition was very positively\u000a      reviewed in the German newspapers, not least the leading broadsheet FAZ\u000a      [Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]. (IMP10)\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Newcastle's extensive and authoritative study of the medieval manuscripts\u000a      that originated in the L&#252;neburg convents has led the Protestant successors\u000a      of these female religious communities to a more informed and in some cases\u000a      considerably revised interpretation of their medieval heritage.

The L&#252;neburg convents, in particular Medingen, have\u000a      been the focus of Newcastle research. Within Northern Europe these\u000a      convents constitute a unique repository not only of late medieval\u000a      devotional texts but also of material culture.\u000a    Henrike L&#228;hnemann (Professor of German Studies, 2006-current) has\u000a      systematically developed her research from an initial analysis of\u000a      individual prayer books (1) right through to the mapping of the\u000a      religious landscape of Northern Germany in the late Middle Ages (6).\u000a      The bilingual (Latin\/Low German) devotional manuscripts of Medingen are\u000a      the most complex and rich sub-set from this remarkable material and form\u000a      the core of L&#228;hnemann's research. After the Reformation these texts were\u000a      scattered across Europe and now even as far as America, to the university\u000a      libraries of Harvard and Michigan. L&#228;hnemann has tracked down over fifty\u000a      of these manuscripts and has systematically catalogued, edited, analysed\u000a      and contextualised them. Furthermore, she has brought the manuscripts\u000a      together as a digital collection thereby making them accessible to the\u000a      wider public. Through the application of perspectives informed by\u000a      codicology, regional history, art history, music history, literary and\u000a      linguistic analysis, it is possible to explore the collective devotional\u000a      identity of a particular female religious house (Medingen) in both its\u000a      social and its cultural context. .\u000a    The Latin and Low German devotional manuscripts, both mono- and\u000a      bilingual, produced in the Northern German convents around 1500 have\u000a      proved a rich source for the nuanced interpretation of one of the most\u000a      formative periods in the shaping of modern Europe. The starting point for\u000a      the underpinning research was an investigation of the materiality of the\u000a      prayer-books as cultural indicators (2), for example, parchment\u000a      strips taken from discarded manuscripts that were then sewn into the\u000a      garments made by the nuns for the wooden figures of Christ and the saints\u000a      (4). This led to a linguistic analysis of the bilingual writing (3),\u000a      which in turn led to a re-evaluation of the education the nuns received (1).\u000a      The conclusions drawn challenge the prevailing view of nuns' limited\u000a      agency in pre-Reformation times (5), demonstrating how these women\u000a      decisively influenced the religious, cultural and intellectual development\u000a      of a regional network that incorporated not only the convents but, via the\u000a      prosperous salt town of L&#252;neburg, the entire Hanseatic League. The new\u000a      insights and knowledge yielded by this research were instrumental in the\u000a      formation of a research network focused on `Northern German Mysticism and\u000a      Devotion' (6) which broke new ground by studying convents as\u000a      intellectual, cultural and religious hubs which shaped Northern Germany as\u000a      a key European region in the late Middle Ages.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21719","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3932488","Name":"Peru"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research has produced impact via two state-of-the-art\u000a      resources: (i) the DECTE corpus, primarily intended for an academic\u000a      audience and (ii) the Talk of the Toon website, which has made the\u000a      collection accessible to the general public. The reach and significance of\u000a      the impact lies in the preservation of the North East's distinctive\u000a      linguistic cultural heritage through informing and influencing the content\u000a      of education beyond the HEI. This has been achieved by providing valuable\u000a      learning resources for teachers and educators from primary, secondary, FE\u000a      and HE levels, thereby extending the study of the region's linguistic and\u000a      cultural heritage in educational institutions in the North East and\u000a      beyond.\u000a    Informing and Influencing the Form or Content of Education\u000a      The Talk of the Toon website has been accessed 3882 times by 2269\u000a      unique visitors between 17 December 2012 and 31 July 2013. There have been\u000a      27,248 page views (average page view per visit was 9 minutes). Although\u000a      visitors from the school sectors of North Eastern England constitute the\u000a      largest number of users so far at 28% of the total, high usage is also\u000a      recorded by visits from York, Toronto at 13% reflecting the fact that the\u000a      site is also heavily used by educators and their students there. Other\u000a      visitors hail from 16 countries worldwide, including Australia, Canada,\u000a      Japan, Russia, South Korea and the USA.\u000a    The website was designed with input from both examiners and teachers in\u000a      order to provide students and educators from primary to HE level with\u000a      resources featuring relevant cross-curriculum materials, including: (i)\u000a      activities relating to a variety of subjects in primary and secondary\u000a      education, incorporating English, IT and history; (ii) topic-based\u000a      browsing of the data with related visual material; (iii) linked audio,\u000a      text, photographic and video data; (iv) primary source materials for use\u000a      in student project work and classroom demonstration; (v) familiarity\u000a      with\/provision of teaching materials related to local linguistic\/cultural\u000a      heritage; and (vi) awareness of the link between the North East's\u000a      historical development and its distinctive dialect. To ensure that the\u000a      project effected real change through take-up in usage of the website in\u000a      education, between 2010 and 2012 the project researchers held a series of\u000a      outreach sessions, sixth form conferences and teacher CPD days with\u000a      educators and students. Evidence of the impact value of these workshops\u000a      can be seen in the teacher and student feedback statements from these\u000a      engagement activities. Asked if the resources demonstrated were useful and\u000a      whether they would make use of them in the classroom, 95% of teachers\u000a      responded positively (IMP1).\u000a    Primary Schools: In May 2011, four groups of primary school pupils\u000a      (94 in total) and their teachers participated in workshops on dialect at\u000a      the Discovery Museum using materials collected in this project that the\u000a      Learning Officer praised for being \"well thought-through\", \"inventive\",\u000a      and for having \"introduced [the students] to ideas they might not have\u000a        come across before\" (IMP2). Acknowledging changes that the\u000a      project brought to the museum and its visitors, she noted that the\u000a      workshops used \"a medium of engagement that we don't use very often &#8212;\u000a        sound &#8212; which is difficult for us to acquire, particularly because of\u000a        issues over permissions and because it is time consuming to collect\"\u000a      (IMP2). This educational programme has informed young learners'\u000a      interaction with, and knowledge of, the importance of dialect within\u000a      culture. Feedback from participants was positive, with one teacher\u000a      commenting that \"It links well with developing pupils' understanding of\u000a        standard\/non-standard English\". Learning about the differences\u000a      between accent and dialect was commented on by most children in their\u000a      feedback forms, as well as their surprise at there being more \"Geordie\"\u000a      words than they realised, with one young participant learning that \"people\u000a        who have posh accents do not need to come from posh places\" (IMP1).\u000a    Secondary Schools: Between March 2011 and July 2012, nine\u000a      workshops were held with 457 students and 53 teachers. Participant\u000a      response was enthusiastic with teachers commenting \"Would\/will be very\u000a        useful for language\/dialect investigations. Quite a lot of our students\u000a        investigate North\/Tyneside accent and dialect\" and \"[We] will\u000a        write it into our course!\" Student feedback was also positive. At\u000a      one A-level workshop (April 2011), 73% of the students participating said\u000a      that they would use the resource for their project work. Students at\u000a      Central Newcastle High School, for example, commented \"I learnt a lot\u000a        of useful information to use in my exam\" (A-Level) and \"it\u000a        allowed me to become more confident in analysing texts\" (AS-level).\u000a      Subsequent feedback and testimonials collected from teachers and examiners\u000a      have also been especially positive, and includes evidence that the website\u000a      has been firmly integrated into schools' syllabi as a key learning\u000a      resource around which lessons have been constructed. The research websites\u000a      have been used for teaching (for example, of accent and dialect), as\u000a      starter activities and to prompt discussion (IMP3). The materials\u000a      are also used in student project work and language investigations, with\u000a      one A-level educator commenting, \"The resources area on the schools\u000a        area of the site is particularly useful for giving [students] some ideas\u000a        about areas they can study independently\" (IMP3). Another\u000a      teacher from Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College has incorporated the Talk\u000a        of the Toon resources into A\/A-S level English Language lessons,\u000a      including the development of teaching materials and teacher notes. He\u000a      commented: \"The main usage is introducing the notion of the data\u000a        investigation project &#8212; collecting and trawling through data, selecting\u000a        an angle and devising a doable question and applying the `key\u000a        constituents'. The data is smashing and it gives students opportunities\u000a        to approach studying it from all sorts of angles\" (IMP4).\u000a      The use of the resources is confirmed via website hits from Darlington\u000a      between 17-23 June 2013 which represented 483 visits\/4,961 page views\u000a      (average visit was 9 minutes) with 73.08% of these coming from the College\u000a      (IMP5).\u000a    Continuing Professional Development: From 2010 to 2012, the\u000a      research team contributed to three CPD workshops for A-level English\u000a      Language teachers (102 attendees). The materials from this project formed\u000a      part of a resource booklet for teachers. As well as citing key outputs\u000a      from the research (3), the DECTE corpus was used to provide\u000a      example activities for classroom teaching (IMP6). Feedback for all\u000a      three sessions was enthusiastic and positive (IMP1), with 82% of\u000a      teachers at one event (December 2010) agreeing that the material was\u000a      directly relevant to their teaching. These teachers noted benefits such\u000a      as: increased knowledge, generation of new ideas to take back to the\u000a      classroom, and interaction with other teachers and linguistics lecturers (IMP1).\u000a      This is a particularly important benefit since many A-Level teachers only\u000a      have university training in English Literature, rather than English\u000a      Language &#8212; though they are now expected to also teach the latter on\u000a      account of the steep rise in popularity of this subject (14,751 examinees\u000a      in 2003 and 24,382 in 2012). The research has thus helped to improve their\u000a      teaching as well as their students' learning.\u000a    HEIs beyond the submitting unit: The academic corpora have been\u000a      used widely in HEIs all over the world. From 2008-2013, 75% of the 119 new\u000a      access requests were from outside Newcastle University, including users in\u000a      24 different countries. The academic and public resources have been\u000a      promoted by academics for their students at undergraduate and postgraduate\u000a      levels worldwide, including Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Peru and the\u000a      Netherlands as well as the US and UK (IMP7). For example, in early\u000a      2013 a Professor at York University in Toronto, used the DECTE and Talk\u000a        of the Toon project resources in an integrated\u000a      undergraduate\/postgraduate module on sociolinguistic research methods,\u000a      where the majority of students used the resources as part of both module\u000a      assignments. The corpora were described as \"an excellent resource for\u000a        sociolinguistic research, including for students with no knowledge of\u000a        the variety\" [...] \"important for having them think about whether\u000a        to work with education or occupation as a social variable, and think\u000a        hard about social class. They also had to think about working with\u000a        decade of birth vs working with age at the time of recording. And they\u000a        learned a lot about English, including its history (e.g. origins of\u000a        `divn't', the `-ly' adverbs, etc.)\" (IMP8). Another\u000a      Professor of English Linguistics at Paris Diderot University, who\u000a      described the corpora as \"a unique resource for the research community\"\u000a      has regularly used the resources in both MA student supervision and\u000a      teaching, \"I have two presentations specifically giving examples from\u000a        the NECTE corpus exemplifying protocols and fieldwork\" (IMP9).\u000a    Informing and Influencing the Museum\/Cultural Heritage Sectors and\u000a          the General Public\u000a      The collaborative activity with primary students at Discovery Museum\u000a      (described above), also assisted in their educational outreach goals &#8212; as\u000a      did the production of a Talk of the Toon CD and booklet to\u000a      accompany the initiative now on sale across Tyne and Wear Museums with\u000a      profits going to the sector. Discovery Museum's Learning Officer confirmed\u000a      that \"we are always looking for new ways to engage school groups and\u000a        make our programme as varied as possible, and these workshops added a\u000a        unique element to the offer\" (IMP2). Through the inclusion\u000a      of photographic resources from existing collections in regional museums,\u000a      namely, the Tyne and Wear Museums and Archives and the Beamish Museum, the\u000a      Talk of the Toon website and booklet have provided a new outlet for\u000a      those resources to be appreciated by the public. Furthermore, the project\u000a      funded the digital preservation of fifty selected films from the North\u000a      East Film Archive (NEFA), enabling them to subsequently offer footage \"to\u000a        a number of other educational and non-commercial projects at a lower\u000a        price as transfers had been completed\" in the words of their Film\u000a      Archive Co-ordinator. As with the other collaborating institutions, he\u000a      added that the project \"helped to raise the profile of the NEFA and the\u000a        work we do\", as well as providing an excellent exemplar of how their\u000a      materials can be successfully exploited (IMP10).\u000a    The project websites, including Talk of the Toon, recorded over\u000a      139,000 hits between June and October 2012 alone. Between December 2010\u000a      and October 2011, researchers delivered five public lectures in Newcastle,\u000a      Morpeth (county town in Northumberland) and Dublin, attended by a total of\u000a      470 people. One of the lectures was posted on iTunesU and has subsequently\u000a      been downloaded over 1,700 times between October 2011 and the end of July\u000a      2013 (IMP5).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Talk of the Toon is an online resource that preserves the cultural\u000a      heritage of North Eastern English dialects giving users unprecedented\u000a      access to multimedia material spanning five decades.

The initial corpus-construction project generated the Newcastle\u000a        Electronic Corpus of Tyneside English, 2001-2005 (NECTE) (1, 3,\u000a        4). This corpus amalgamated two legacy databases, and was primarily\u000a      intended as an academic resource. Since the NECTE site went live in 2005 (http:\/\/research.ncl.ac.uk\/necte\/),\u000a      researchers have used the material extensively in teaching and research.\u000a      Following this, a new corpus was compiled, the Newcastle Electronic\u000a        Corpus of Tyneside English 2, 2007-2009 (NECTE2) (http:\/\/research.ncl.ac.uk\/necte2\/).\u000a      Based on a collection of interviews conducted in the Tyneside area since\u000a      2007, this research added another time slice to the existing NECTE corpus\u000a      (2).\u000a    Building on the success of these sites, researchers undertook the new\u000a      DECTE project (2010-2012) (http:\/\/research.ncl.ac.uk\/decte\/).\u000a      This initiative developed the NECTE\/NECTE2 corpora to improve their\u000a      sustainability by uniting the data in a single corpus and augmenting its\u000a      content. As a result, DECTE is a state-of-the-art resource, containing\u000a      features absent from many other corpora, such as aligned digital audio and\u000a      text (the ability to see the transcribed text and hear the recording\u000a      simultaneously). Moreover, it is one of only two databases worldwide\u000a      containing speech samples from speakers born across 100 years of time and\u000a      it is unique in preserving and thus enhancing the cultural and linguistic\u000a      diversity of the North East. The creation of this resource has shed new\u000a      light on both generational differences and community-wide social changes\u000a      in the region from 1895 to the present which make it important for\u000a      heritage preservation purposes and for raising the awareness of regional\u000a      distinctiveness amongst the wider public. It is the latter point that\u000a      drove another key objective of the DECTE project, which was to widen the\u000a      impact of the NECTE\/NECTE2 corpora beyond academia by presenting the\u000a      content in more accessible formats to divergent user groups. This was\u000a      achieved via a new public website, launched in October 2011, Talk of\u000a        the Toon (http:\/\/research.ncl.ac.uk\/decte\/toon)\u000a      which involved linking the corpora with digitised multimedia materials\u000a      from the collections of three heritage institutions: Beamish Museum (http:\/\/www.beamish.org.uk\/),\u000a      the North East Film Archive (http:\/\/www.northeastfilmarchive.com\/),\u000a      and Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums (http:\/\/www.twmuseums.org.uk\/).\u000a      The academic DECTE corpus and Talk of the Toon sites are\u000a      recognised world-wide as an invaluable repository by academic researchers,\u000a      educators, the heritage sector and the wider public and it is through\u000a      these sites that impact is being claimed.\u000a    The principal investigator on these projects was Prof. Karen Corrigan.\u000a      Prof. Joan Beal, Dr Isabelle Buchstaller and Dr Hermann Moisl acted as\u000a      co-investigators. Corrigan and Moisl have been employed at Newcastle for\u000a      the duration of the projects while Beal and Buchstaller left Newcastle in\u000a      2001 and 2011, respectively.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21720","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3277605","Name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Introduction\u000a      The research has generated outputs which have made local cultural\u000a      heritages accessible to international audiences, have helped to preserve\u000a      cultural heritage amongst source-language communities, and have enabled\u000a      others to continue these processes.\u000a    \u000a      \u000aJones's translations and commentaries on the works of leading\u000a          Dutch, Bosnian and Serbian poets. Jones research has demonstrated\u000a        the effectiveness of `creatively faithful' translation strategies that\u000a        reflect style and underlying image. He implements these in his own\u000a        translations, e.g. using norm-breaking archaic or dialect voices, and\u000a        prioritising poetic texture. The effectiveness of this approach has led\u000a        to Jones being seen as \"among the finest translators\" from Dutch\u000a        into English (IMP5) and \"the leading and most influential\u000a          translator of poetry from South Slavic languages\" (IMP1).\u000a        The quality of the output ensures wide readership. This affects three\u000a        main groups. Firstly, English-reading poetry communities (publishers,\u000a        critics, poets and general readers) gain significant cultural value by\u000a        reading and hearing new, exciting poetry. Secondly, because English is a\u000a        global language, this gives source-language (Dutch, Bosnian, Serbian)\u000a        poets globalized reach, raising their status from `famous at home' to\u000a        that of `key European poet'. Thirdly, for source-language communities at\u000a        home and in diaspora, seeing `their' poets internationalized via English\u000a        strengthens cultural pride.\u000a      \u000aExpert poetry-translation seminars, and feedback to new\u000a          translators. These transmit research findings which have two key\u000a        impacts: (i) they support experienced and novice poetry translators to\u000a        produce high-quality translations, thereby (ii) assuring the quality of\u000a        the end product.\u000a    \u000a    Impact via research-informed poetry translation\u000a      Jones has published 18 book-length poetry translations from Bosnian,\u000a      Serbian and Dutch (plus Hungarian and Russian), including four in the REF\u000a      period. His poetry translations have won 14 awards, including 5 from 2008\u000a      to 2013 (Sarajevo International Book Fair `Publication of the Year' 2008;\u000a      David Reid Poetry Translation Prize 2nd 2008, 1st\u000a      2010; Vondel Translation Prize Runner-up 2008; John Dryden Translation\u000a      Competition 1st Prize 2013). These translations are a key\u000a      vehicle for cultural exchange; and impact on English-language readers (but\u000a      also source- and third- language readers) is considerable: \"with\u000a        [Jones's] translation work, Bosnian culture has gained [...] an\u000a        ambassador the like of whom it has never had before\" (IMP2).\u000a      Crucial to this success is Jones's prioritisation of style, his \"creative\u000a        inventiveness\" (IMP5), and cultural knowledge, which are\u000a      informed by his research findings (IMP1). Two example poets given\u000a      global reach by Jones's translations are outlined below:\u000a    1. Jones has produced the first book-length English translation of\u000a      leading Dutch 20th-century poet Hans Faverey. Selected\u000a      poems Against the Forgetting (London, Anvil, 1994; expanded\u000a      edition New York, New Directions, 2004; James Brockway Prize, 2005) put\u000a      Faverey on the world poetry map. The Editor\/Founder of Leon Works literary\u000a      press states that this \"introduc[ed] U.S. readers of poetry [...] to\u000a        an indisputable visionary of the poetic line\" (IMP3),\u000a      inspiring her to commission Chrysanthemums, Rowers (Providence RI,\u000a      Leon Works, 2011; co-tr. Lela Faverey, with introductory essay by Jones).\u000a      This has exposed the U.S. poetry market to culturally significant texts,\u000a      in which publishers are not simply consumers but wider enablers of inter-\u000a      cultural communication. Both of these translations generated further\u000a      impact, e.g.:\u000a    (i) A public reading and panel discussion about Faverey at New York Poets\u000a      House (2012) &#8212; with Jones, literary publisher\/writer\/academic Renee\u000a      Gladman, leading US critic Eliot Weinberger, New Directions poetry editor\u000a      Jeffrey Yang, and Poets House Program Director Stephen Motika (IMP4).\u000a      About 30 people attended (a contextually high turnout), including the\u000a      Netherlands Consul.\u000a    (ii) Reading Jones's English versions \"inspired\" (IMP5)\u000a      translators to translate Faverey from Dutch to French (Po&#232;mes, tr.\u000a      Linder and Such&#232;re; Courbevoie: TH.TY, 2012).\u000a    (iii) The Project for Innovative Poetry (PIP) website, which received\u000a      over 90,000 visitors between 2000-2011, posted a review of Against the\u000a        Forgetting (2011), drawing the attention of readers with an interest\u000a      in international poetry (IMP6).\u000a    (iv) A Faverey biography plus translated poem in the promotional work Dutch\u000a        Poetry Classics (2012) by the Dutch Foundation for Literature (DFL),\u000a      the Netherlands body overseeing literary `exports'. A review essay (2011)\u000a      on Faverey in The Low Countries (yearbook promoting Dutch\u000a      arts\/culture) cites Against the Forgetting (IMP6).\u000a    2. Mak Dizdar's poetry collection Stone Sleeper is so\u000a      central to Bosnian culture that it appears on Bosnia's 10-mark banknote.\u000a      Jones has produced its only English translation (Sarajevo: DID, 1999;\u000a      revised edition London: Anvil, 2009), using norm-breaking voice and\u000a      poetic-texture techniques to reflect Dizdar's poetic pyrotechnics. Jones's\u000a      techniques emerged from his research, and the resulting work was praised\u000a      as having \"brought this work into [the] treasury of the world's most\u000a        highly-valued cultural achievements\" and \"a precious confirmation\u000a        of [Bosnian] cultural identity\" which helped \"affirm\u000a        South-Eastern Europe's cultural plurality\" (IMP2). Example\u000a      evidence is:\u000a    \u000a      4.55\/5 rating by 77 readers (many with Bosnian names) on the GoodReads\u000a        website; a 2012 review states: \"It tells who we [Bosnians] are so we\u000a          have to keep on reading it over and over again\" (IMP6).\u000a      Web\/blog reposts of Jones's translations: e.g. a poem from Jones's\u000a        2004 research article (Section 3: 2) on the blog Wonderful Bosnia\u000a          and Herzegovina (2008) (IMP7).\u000a      Jones's Stone Sleeper was `translated onward' from English\u000a        into Urdu (tr. Hamid, Islamabad, National Book Foundation, 2008)\u000a        (IMP2): this secondary impact, on Urdu readers, would not have\u000a        been possible without Jones's version.\u000a      Bosnian philosopher Rusmir Mahmut&#263;ehaji&#263; used Jones's translations in\u000a        an English- language essay (2008) and book (2011) on Dizdar which\u000a        promote a non-ethnicized, multi- faith model of Bosnian society (IMP8-9).\u000a    \u000a    Significance and reach: Newcastle research regarding the interplay\u000a      between norms, semantic faithfulness, stylistic loyalty and\u000a      cultural-political engagement, therefore, promotes highly effective\u000a      international communication of poetry. This (i) gives non-English-language\u000a      poets international prestige, bringing them into a global market; (ii)\u000a      broadens the cultural experience of native and non-native English readers;\u000a      and (iii) enables source-language publics to validate their own culture\u000a      via English translation.\u000a    Impact via research-informed translator training\u000a      Jones's research also informs advice transmitted directly to other\u000a      translators, impacting on their translating approaches and subsequently on\u000a      readers who benefit from their translations. Specifically, work with\u000a      poetry translators from Dutch has generated impact through poetry seminars\u000a      led by Jones at the DFL's `Literary Translation Days' (Utrecht, 2010) (IMP5),\u000a      and at Brockway Poetry Translation Workshops in which Jones has acted as\u000a      both leader (Amsterdam, 2005) and participant (Rotterdam, 2013) (IMP5)\u000a    Jones's research-led internationalisation of poets such as Faverey also\u000a      inspires interest in poetry translation amongst novice translators and\u000a      creative writers, generating further training impacts. In 2012, publisher\u000a      Renee Gladman invited Jones to deliver two events to staff, students and\u000a      public at the Ivy-League's Brown University. The first was a workshop with\u000a      around 8 creative writing students; the second was a talk and reading to\u000a      about 15 staff, students and members of the public on poetry translation (IMP10).\u000a      These types of engagement activities indicate that Newcastle's translation\u000a      research is generating global interest in innovative poetry-translation\u000a      methods and greater appreciation for `international' culture, which can\u000a      only benefit source poets and cultures. The DFL's translation support\u000a      work, for example, shows how highly the Dutch government values the\u000a      globalisation of its literary output via agents such as Jones. This is\u000a      exemplified in the DFL list, from which all literary translations\u000a      receiving state funding must choose a translator. Since 1985, Jones has\u000a      acted as an assessor for this list, providing formative feedback for\u000a      submissions and helping the DFL to assure the quality of the Netherlands'\u000a      cultural exports (IMP3).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Jones's research-led translations expertly and innovatively communicate\u000a      Bosnian, Serbian and Dutch poetry to English-reading poetry audiences\u000a      (including poets) worldwide. His translations enable poets whose reach has\u000a      previously been limited to single-language areas to expand towards\u000a      English-reading audiences, thus enriching these audiences' cultural\u000a      experience and enhancing Bosnian\/Serbian\/Dutch citizens' pride in their\u000a      domestic literary heritage.\u000a    Jones's publications are the recognised English translations of these\u000a      works. From 2008 to 2013, they have been used in numerous publications and\u000a      websites as well as stimulating `onward' translations. His output has\u000a      served as a catalyst for new events celebrating the poets, poems and\u000a      cultures that he has worked on. The techniques developed as part of\u000a      Jones's research also underpin expert-seminar leadership and\u000a      translator-assessment work. This has influenced other translators' methods\u000a      and enabled them to communicate poetry more effectively across linguistic\u000a      barriers to increasingly larger audiences.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    Newcastle University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Newcastle upon Tyne (University of)","InstitutionName":"Newcastle University","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North East","UKPRN":10007799}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2759794","Name":"Amsterdam"},{"GeoNamesId":"3023141","Name":"Courbevoie"},{"GeoNamesId":"3191281","Name":"Sarajevo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2747891","Name":"Rotterdam"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

This often implies a political stance\u000a        (e.g. opposing the `ethno-nationalist' politics that fuelled the 1990s\u000a        post- Yugoslav wars) (1, 2, 3). The research argues that teams\u000a        should strive for an ethics of `allowing otherness' in translations and\u000a        how they are presented (2). Other findings are that: teams' main\u000a        allegiances are typically to the source (rather than target) culture;\u000a        translations may send political\/cultural signals to both target-culture\u000a        and source-culture readers; and translations may increase a poet's source-country\u000a        prestige. (3).\u000a    \u000a    The following research findings and conclusions feed particularly\u000a      strongly into the two ways of delivering impact mentioned above and in\u000a      Section 5:\u000a    \u000a      Poetry translators should prioritise recreating the source's\u000a        underlying intent, voices and texture in an effective target-language\u000a        poem, even if this is less literal or if it breaches target-culture\u000a        norms.\u000a      `Natural' target-language poetic texture is central to translations'\u000a        success amongst readers.\u000a      Input from others is crucial: source poets, fellow translators and\u000a        target-language poets, etc.\u000a      Poetry translators should not be afraid to support intercultural and\u000a        political aims, if these enhance tolerance and understanding, and if\u000a        translators openly admit to them (e.g. in a Translator's Introduction).\u000a        This underlies, for instance, Jones's translations in support of a non-\u000a        ethnicized view of Bosnian society from 1999 to date: Dizdar's Stone\u000a          Sleeper (Section 4) and other works.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21800","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As a special advisor to The Surreal House exhibition at the\u000d\u000a      Barbican in London, Fotiade directed\u000d\u000a      new ways of presenting the link between Surrealist film and architecture &#8212;\u000d\u000a      one of the key aims of\u000d\u000a      the show.

The Barbican's senior curator contacted\u000d\u000a      Fotiade after reading her\u000d\u000a      contributions to specialist books on Surrealist visual art and the 1998\u000d\u000a      issue of Screen\u000d\u000a      magazine\u000d\u000a      devoted to Surrealist cinema which Fotiade edited. Fotiade was approached\u000d\u000a      as the UK's foremost\u000d\u000a      expert on Surrealist cinema and was selected as one of four international\u000d\u000a      special advisors invited\u000d\u000a      to contribute to the exhibition and catalogue.\u000d\u000a    The 42,500+ visitors to the Barbican's exhibition had an opportunity to\u000d\u000a      experience firsthand some\u000d\u000a      of the best-known installations and visual art works related to the early\u000d\u000a      Surrealist period (including\u000d\u000a      paintings by Dali, Miro and Ernst) alongside later developments in the\u000d\u000a      Anglophone and American\u000d\u000a      post-war art world. The show\u000d\u000a      brought together over 170 works, many of which had not been shown\u000d\u000a      before in the UK, including &#8212; in addition to paintings &#8212; drawings,\u000d\u000a      photography, installations and\u000d\u000a      architecture.\u000d\u000a    The Barbican's senior curator was keen to use films as a way of enhancing\u000d\u000a      the visitor experience\u000d\u000a      and Fotiade helped select the film content which became an integral part\u000d\u000a      of the exhibition.\u000d\u000a      Fotiade's choice of films for the Barbican exhibition reflected the\u000d\u000a      evolution of the Surrealist\u000d\u000a      movement in Europe and the USA, with representative illustrations from the\u000d\u000a      work of Maya Deren,\u000d\u000a      Jean-Luc Godard's celebrated Le M&#233;pris, and Andrei Tarkovsky's\u000d\u000a      last film, The Sacrifice. Fotiade\u000d\u000a      also provided detailed essays for the exhibition\u000d\u000a        catalogue on Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi, Le\u000d\u000a      Facteur Cheval (a postman who built his `ideal palace' out of random\u000d\u000a      stones over 33 years), the\u000d\u000a      Villa Malaparte in Capri, and filmmakers Maya Deren and Andrei Tarkovsky.\u000d\u000a      These essays\u000d\u000a      focused on the interaction between Surrealist art and modern architecture\u000d\u000a      and between\u000d\u000a      architecture and cinema in addition to the legacy of the Surrealist\u000d\u000a      movement in the work of post-war\u000d\u000a      experimental\/art-house filmmakers such as Deren, Godard and Tarkovsky.\u000d\u000a      Fortiade's analysis\u000d\u000a      of Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice was also chosen by the Barbican as\u000d\u000a      the closing statement of the\u000d\u000a      exhibition. The Barbican curator described Fotiade's contribution:\u000d\u000a    Ramona, as one of the Advisors, made an invaluable contribution in terms\u000d\u000a      of helping decide\u000d\u000a      on filmic content for this exhibition. She quickly understood the project\u000d\u000a      and my vision for it. I\u000d\u000a      couldn't have done the exhibition without support from academics with\u000d\u000a      in-depth knowledge of\u000d\u000a      surrealism. I think the films she suggested &#8212; Tarkovsky, Deren and Godard\u000d\u000a      &#8212; were central to\u000d\u000a      the success of the project. It totally relied on the mix of disciplines\u000d\u000a      and cross-generational\u000d\u000a      approach. The idea was that the blend of exhibits would render the whole\u000d\u000a      like a dream. The\u000d\u000a      exhibition far exceeded audience target and was critically acclaimed in\u000d\u000a      many of the major\u000d\u000a      national papers. The book is beautiful and well-researched. Ramona's\u000d\u000a      contribution to that was\u000d\u000a      also incredibly welcome &#8212; her sensitivity to the subject and thorough\u000d\u000a      understanding of the\u000d\u000a      significance of these films to surrealism shines through in the text.\u000d\u000a    The exhibition was of great public interest and reached a wide\u000d\u000a      international audience. The Surreal\u000d\u000a        House was described as an \"excellent opportunity to see rarely\u000d\u000a      exhibited works brought together\u000d\u000a      under an interesting guise.\" It was awarded four out of five stars by\u000d        Time Out\u000d\u000a          London and\u000d\u000a      recommended by the BBC.\u000d\u000a    The significance of the films selected by Fotiade was noted in the\u000d\u000a      reviews. For example,\u000d\u000a      architecture and design magazine Blueprint stated: \"The curators\u000d\u000a      have made an intelligent choice\u000d\u000a      over the use of sound, as a multitude of different voices and sounds from\u000d\u000a      various films situated in a\u000d\u000a      range of locations are allowed to collide and overlap each other creating\u000d\u000a      an atmospheric, confusing\u000d\u000a      and haunting effect.\" Another review, in online magazine Interface,\u000d\u000a      also commended the curation:\u000d\u000a    I found `The Surreal House' to be a satisfying and stimulating exhibition\u000d\u000a      which, although\u000d\u000a      detailed and dense to the extent that it would practically be impossible\u000d\u000a      to watch all the films\u000d\u000a      and examine every item in one visit or for that matter list them all here,\u000d\u000a      the experience of the\u000d\u000a      curation enabled this visitor to read the whole and the detail together\u000d\u000a      and feel compelled to\u000d\u000a      embark on further inquiries into several of the works that stood out for\u000d\u000a      me.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Ramona Fotiade helped shape an exhibition on Surrealism that attracted\u000d\u000a      42,500 visitors to the\u000d\u000a      Barbican Centre, London, and secured extensive positive media coverage.\u000d\u000a      Fotiade was one of four\u000d\u000a      high-profile international special advisors contributing to The\u000d\u000a        Surreal House exhibition, which ran\u000d\u000a      from June to September 2010 at the Barbican, Europe's largest multi-arts\u000d\u000a      centre.

As such the University has been instrumental in\u000d\u000a      shifting educational perceptions that now see BD as a valid subject\u000d\u000a      featuring on syllabi worldwide. The academic effect is international &#8212;\u000d\u000a      courses are now widespread and largely part of university education &#8212; but\u000d\u000a      moreover our research has moved beyond the lecture theatre and into the\u000d\u000a      wider cultural and non-academic world. The shifting perception of BD is\u000d\u000a      set within the context of the central University of Glasgow-based argument\u000d\u000a      that the comic strip is part of broader text\/image culture which has a\u000d\u000a      long, often under-explored tradition.\u000d\u000a    Through key publications, invited lectures and exhibitions, as well as\u000d\u000a      the establishment of the Stirling Maxwell Centre for the Study of\u000d\u000a      Text\/Image Cultures in 2011 and the Centre for Emblem Studies 15 years\u000d\u000a      previously, research at the University of Glasgow has been instrumental in\u000d\u000a      propagating a historical framing of text\/image forms from Renaissance\u000d\u000a      emblem books to modern day comic strips and graphic novels. Sir William\u000d\u000a      Stirling Maxwell (1818-1878) amassed the world's most complete collection\u000d\u000a      of emblem books, the world's most important archive in this field.\u000d\u000a      Research at Glasgow on BD and emblem books helps preserve and\u000d\u000a      contextualise these cultural artefacts and makes them available to a wider\u000d\u000a      public audience. Developed in the 16th century, emblem books\u000d\u000a      were extremely fashionable and had enormous influence on literature and\u000d\u000a      the visual arts. They featured symbolic pictures and text which expressed\u000d\u000a      a moral, political or religious message which was then decoded by the\u000d\u000a      reader. Over the next 200 years, several thousand were issued from\u000d\u000a      printing presses across Europe. Codes, emblem books and emblematic\u000d\u000a      thinking have featured prominently in popular fiction and films, most\u000d\u000a      famously in Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code.\u000d\u000a    Influence on culture and public engagement\u000d\u000a      In 2011 Grove organised an exhibition entitled `Breaking the Renaissance\u000d\u000a      Code: Emblems and Emblem Books' which was on display for three months at\u000d\u000a      the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, Glasgow, attracting 15,414 visitors.\u000d\u000a      The exhibition set emblem books from the Stirling Maxwell Centre alongside\u000d\u000a      contemporary artwork, advertising and BD, exploring the development of\u000d\u000a      emblem books in Europe during the sixteenth century onwards, their decline\u000d\u000a      and subsequent revival in the Victorian Age and the ways in which they\u000d\u000a      have influenced literature and the visual arts in the modern world. In\u000d\u000a      addition to high visitor numbers, the show was well reviewed in the\u000d\u000a      Scottish press, receiving a 4-star rating from The List, being\u000d\u000a      included in the `Hit List' selection of `best' exhibitions, and being\u000d\u000a      selected as Critic's Choice in The Scotsman.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000aFigure 1.

The database\u000d\u000a      resulted from a project, funded by the Arts &amp; Humanities Research\u000d\u000a      Council and led by Adams, to digitise all French emblem books of the 16th\u000d\u000a      century and their Latin versions. The site allows scholars and the\u000d\u000a      interested public to find full text and page scans for these fragile and\u000d\u000a      rare books. A sister site, `Alciato at Glasgow', provides access to 22\u000d\u000a      editions of the work of Andrea Alciato, considered the `father' of the\u000d\u000a      emblem genre.

Their research\u000d\u000a      has created a shift in cultural perceptions towards comics and a greater\u000d\u000a      appreciation and awareness of BD in English-speaking academic and general\u000d\u000a      audiences. Grove has been invited to lecture on BD and text\/image related\u000d\u000a      material at the Universities of Cuenca, UC Dublin, Dundee, Durham,\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh, Grenoble, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Montpellier, Nicosia,\u000d\u000a      Odense, Paris IV-Sorbonne, Portland (OR), Rennes, Strasbourg and the &#201;cole\u000d\u000a      Normale Sup&#233;rieure (Lyon), the BnF and Palais du Luxembourg (Paris).\u000d\u000a    In France, comics and BD are considered far more seriously, often as a\u000d\u000a      way to disseminate political views and encourage serious public debate.\u000d\u000a      However, due largely to University of Glasgow research and dissemination,\u000d\u000a      BD is now widely seen as part of a broader culture of text\/image\u000d\u000a      expression in English-speaking countries, with a historical context beyond\u000d\u000a      that normally attributed to comics. This is demonstrated in the\u000d\u000a      introduction and subsequent widespread adoption of BD as an academic\u000d\u000a      field. The influence of Glasgow research on this development is evidenced\u000d\u000a      by statements from roughly two dozen higher education institutions.\u000d\u000a      Selected statements include that from the Central Saint Martins College of\u000d\u000a      Arts and Design, University of the Arts London:\u000d\u000a    The books by Dr Laurence Grove have been pivotal, and the IBDS is a hub for\u000d\u000a    information and expertise. [...] Glasgow (and Dr Grove) was very much the\u000d\u000a    starting point for what is now a well-established and thriving branch of\u000d\u000a    comics studies.\u000d\u000a    And from Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, USA,\u000d\u000a      My research and teaching of almost an entire decade has been immensely\u000d\u000a      enriched by bande dessin&#233;e-related initiatives issuing to a considerable\u000d\u000a      degree from the University of Glasgow.\u000d\u000a    Examples of courses worldwide that draw upon BD-related material and have\u000d\u000a      been influenced by ideas, contacts and resources gained at Glasgow\u000d\u000a      conferences can be seen at institutions such as the University of Wales\u000d\u000a      Trinity Saint David (since 2009, around 20 students per year), the\u000d\u000a      National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (around 15 students per\u000d\u000a      year), the University of Kentucky (since 2011, around 25 students), Miami\u000d\u000a      OH (since 2004, student numbers increasing from around 20 to 40 in\u000d\u000a      2012-2013) and Central Saint Martin's College of Arts and Design, London\u000d\u000a      (since 1995, around 40 students per class).\u000d\u000a    Undergraduate courses in BD are available in 15-20 universities in the UK\u000d\u000a      and across North America (such courses can be found at, for example, the\u000d\u000a      Universities of Leicester, Brighton, Sheffield, Manchester Metropolitan\u000d\u000a      and Dundee as well as Glasgow in the UK; the University of London\u000d\u000a      Institute in Paris, and Miami OH, Wharton College and University of\u000d\u000a      Michigan in the US). Perhaps just as significantly, BD now features on\u000d\u000a      general cultural courses that are not BD-based. Examples include `Gay\u000d\u000a      Fiction' at University of Pittsburgh, or `Belgian Culture' offered by\u000d\u000a      Queen Margaret University.\u000d\u000a    The National University of Singapore is currently developing a freshman\u000d\u000a      seminar to be introduced in 2015-16 on Comics, BD, and Manga, with Grove's\u000d\u000a      Comics in French: The European Bande Dessin&#233;e in Context assigned\u000d\u000a      as reading.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000aFigure 2.

Following Glasgow-led research and\u000d\u000a      teaching, the study of BD has been accepted as a discipline worthy of\u000d\u000a      intellectual engagement, with BD courses and modules adopted in around 20\u000d\u000a      universities across the UK, Europe and North America. This unique art form\u000d\u000a      and cultural output has also been brought to a much broader public via\u000d\u000a      exhibitions, conferences and media debate, with the emphasis on BD as a\u000d\u000a      social mirror for which the historical context is key.

The use of images and\u000d\u000a      the many translations or multilingual editions of such texts allowed\u000d\u000a      emblem books to circulate across Europe, encouraging a fertile dialectic\u000d\u000a      between specific national traditions and common cultural elements. The\u000d\u000a      huge textual and visual corpus fed by the unparalleled fortune this genre\u000d\u000a      enjoyed in the 16th and 17th centuries has to be\u000d\u000a      considered not only as a sociological and historical document of European\u000d\u000a      culture, but also as an extraordinary, though not yet adequately valued,\u000d\u000a      artistic heritage. The emblem and related Early Modern forms have been\u000d\u000a      applied to broader critical applications of visual culture, and the French\u000d\u000a      comic strip has become a historically situated phenomenon worthy of\u000d\u000a      intellectual discourse.\u000d\u000a    Research in Glasgow has led the field in this notion of `parallel\u000d\u000a      mentalities'.

By assimilating the outlook of the early\u000d\u000a      text\/image era &#8212; the first aetas emblematica &#8212; with that of the BD\u000d\u000a      boom, research from Glasgow has led the field in the notion of `parallel\u000d\u000a      mentalities'. In tangible terms, this has meant a previously unconsidered\u000d\u000a      historical contextualisation of BD, as well as a broader application of\u000d\u000a      the workings of earlier visual forms.\u000d\u000a    Since 1999 Laurence Grove (Senior Lecturer\/Reader in French, University\u000d\u000a      of Glasgow) has been examining the historical and cultural resonance of\u000d\u000a      the BD comic strips\/graphic novels in France and Belgium. Commenting on\u000d\u000a      social issues, politics and news in these countries from the early 20th\u000d\u000a      century, the importance of BD in French cultural studies had been\u000d\u000a      overlooked in the UK and in many countries. He argues that BD should be\u000d\u000a      studied within a historical and cultural narrative that has its roots in\u000d\u000a      the Early Modern emblem, which juxtaposes image with text to set a riddle,\u000d\u000a      improve understanding or provide commentary and which has influenced art\u000d\u000a      and literature through the centuries.\u000d\u000a    In 1999 Grove organised one of the first international conferences on BD\u000d\u000a      at the University of Glasgow, the follow-up conference in 2001, when the\u000d\u000a      IBDS was founded, as well as subsequent conferences in London in 2007 and\u000d\u000a      2009. The 2013 IBDS conference (June 24-28, Glasgow and Dundee) hosted 150\u000d\u000a      participants from six continents and generated 900 tweets. Grove has been\u000d\u000a      a regular contributor to academic discourse over the period, publishing\u000d\u000a      nine books (as sole or co-author or as editor) and many articles in\u000d\u000a      international publications, as well as co-founding and editing the journal\u000d\u000a      European Comic Art in 2008, published bi-annually in association\u000d\u000a      with the American Bande Dessin&#233;e Society and the IBDS. Grove has given\u000d\u000a      keynote speeches at the University of Cambridge (Adaptation Conference,\u000d\u000a      2009), St Joseph's University (the Twentieth Annual St Joseph's Lecture,\u000d\u000a      Philadelphia, 2010), the University of Pittsburgh (The Idea of France\u000d\u000a      Conference, 2011) and the University of Wisconsin Madison (Spiritual\u000d\u000a      Optiks Conference, May 2013).\u000d\u000a    Key researchers in the field at Glasgow have been Laurence Grove (Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer 1995-2011, Reader in French 2011-present); Charles Forsdick\u000d\u000a      (Lecturer in French, 1995-1999) and, specifically with respect to emblem\u000d\u000a      digitisation, Alison Adams (Professor of Emblem Studies 1973-2007,\u000d\u000a      Honorary Professorial Research Fellow 2008-present).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22021","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Ivan Bunin (1870-1953) was the first Russian writer to win the Nobel\u000a      Prize for literature (1933), but he is not particularly well known to\u000a      readers in the West. His works were banned in the former Soviet Union for\u000a      many years, due to his anti-Communist views. Even after immigrating to\u000a      France, Bunin's writing style &#8212; not heavily based on narrative as\u000a      better-known Russian writers were &#8212; made it difficult for translations to\u000a      satisfactorily recreate his works, and so they remained relatively\u000a      unknown. According to Rogatchevski's research the challenge in reading\u000a      Bunin's works has always been his focus on the `minute psychological\u000a      movement of the human soul' and the difficulties this presents to\u000a      translators. As language evolves and changes over time, so does the\u000a      translation of a unique writing style focusing on characters' inner worlds\u000a      rather than their actions.\u000a    Rogatchevski is one of only a handful of experts on Bunin in UK higher\u000a      education. In 2007 he was commissioned by the London-based independent\u000a      publishing company Alma Books\u000a      (established in 2005) to contribute to its Alma Classics \u000a      catalogue. Named Independent Publisher of the Year in 2013\u000a      at the Bookseller Industry Awards, at least 40% of Alma's published titles\u000a      are translations from languages including French, Spanish, Italian, German\u000a      and Japanese. Alma wanted to be the first publisher to reintroduce Bunin\u000a      to contemporary audiences. Editors were introduced to Rogatchevski's\u000a      research (1999-2004) into the Bunin archives and correspondence, including\u000a      the writer's interwar publishers Hogarth Press, by the Curator of the\u000a      Leeds Russian Archive (LRA), Richard Davies MBE (the LRA has significant\u000a      Bunin-related holdings in its possession, and Davies and Rogatchevski are\u000a      currently preparing for publication Bunin's correspondence with the\u000a      Russian &#233;migr&#233; author Aleksandr Amfiteatrov; Rogatchevski gave a talk on\u000a      some aspects of this correspondence in November 2009 at the 41st National\u000a      Convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic\u000a      Studies in Boston).\u000a    Alma Classics commissioned Rogatchevski to contribute a substantial\u000a      section of over 20 pages on Bunin's life and works, along with a\u000a      discussion of film adaptations to be included as an afterword in Dark\u000a        Avenues, translated by Hugh Aplin and published by Alma Classics in\u000a      2008 as part of their OneWorld Classics series. The `extra material'\u000a      section is a feature of the Oneworld Classics books and constitutes one of\u000a      their unique selling points. For less widely known authors such as Bunin,\u000a      the added information and insight can make a significant contribution to\u000a      readers' knowledge. Bunin's reintroduction to UK readers (the last British\u000a      translation in book form before Oneworld Classics was in 1984) required a\u000a      reassessment of his art, and Rogatchevski's research expertise in Bunin's\u000a      life and works served as a specialist foundation.\u000a    These Alma Classics publications are the only English-language versions\u000a      of Bunin's work available. To date (July 2013), 2,266 copies of Dark\u000a        Avenues have been sold, and it was named as one of the New\u000a        Statesman's `Books of the Year' in 2008, with a special commentary\u000a      by John Gray. The East-West Review (the journal of the Great\u000a      Britain-Russia Society) identified Rogatchevski's contribution to the\u000a      volume `extensive' (issue 19, 2008, p. 35). The book was also launched at\u000a      a public talk at the Glasgow University Literary Society focusing on\u000a      Bunin's life and work, delivered by Rogatchevski on 27 October 2008, with\u000a      some 30 people attending.\u000a    The dedicated section on Bunin was reproduced in The Village,\u000a      translated by Hugh and Galya Aplin and published by Alma Classics in 2009,\u000a      also as part of their OneWorld Classics series. The afterword was\u000a      particularly praised by the Times Literary Supplement reviewer,\u000a      Donald Rayfield, in a review published on 4 September 2009: `The valuable\u000a      part of this book is the 20-page sketch by Andrei Rogatchevski of Bunin's\u000a      life and works; rarely is so much information and appreciation neatly\u000a      packed into an afterword.'

He has been instrumental in the first attempt in decades\u000a      to introduce the works of Ivan Bunin to new audiences through the\u000a      inclusion of his research-driven insight into Bunin's work and life in\u000a      texts supporting new translations of the author's short stories and novel.\u000a    Rogatchevski's input to Dark Avenues and The Village was,\u000a      to a significant degree, informed and inspired by the Bunin-related\u000a      archival findings that he made in early 2000. These resulted from a\u000a      research trip by Rogatchevski to the University of Reading in autumn 1999,\u000a      supported by an Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council grant, `S S\u000a      Koteliansky and the Hogarth Press'.

Rogatchevski's access to Bunin's\u000a      correspondence with the Hogarth Press, as well as the publisher's\u000a      accounts, afforded insights into the guiding principles of choosing\u000a      particular pieces for translation and suitable translators &#8212; not to\u000a      mention the publishing costs including Bunin's royalties. An article on\u000a      the history of Bunin's communications with the Hogarth Press, as well as\u000a      his published translations, followed in the first of a series of volumes,\u000a      produced in Russia by a commercial press and devoted to the recently\u000a      discovered data about Bunin, archival and otherwise, supplied with a\u000a      scholarly apparatus.\u000a    In a parallel development, a separate article on Bunin's life and oeuvre,\u000a      appeared in The Slavonic and East European Review.

Press coverage included an STV\u000a      interview with Campbell and Lyle, and a broadcast involving Morrison and\u000a      Lyle on Janice Forsyth's Culture Caf&#233; programme on BBC Radio Scotland, and\u000a      newspaper articles. By 31 July 2013, the Greig-Duncan website had received\u000a      2,205 views &#8212; 1,618 from the UK, with the top 5 international countries\u000a      being the USA, New Zealand, Germany, Canada and Spain (5.9).\u000a    The website has been innovative by showing how songs from the collection\u000a      are performed within the tradition at the modern-day. In recognition of\u000a      this, a newspaper article in The Scotsman (20 July 2013) reported:\u000a      \"Thanks to the website [...] people all over the world can now access\u000a      these YouTube videos of peerless renditions by 16 of Scotland's leading\u000a      interpreters of traditional song\" (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/omxm65l).\u000a    Survivals and Revivals.

The project was run jointly with the University of the\u000a      Highlands and Islands. Digitisation centres were set up in South Uist and\u000a      in the SSA; a team of 30 cataloguers was employed to provide descriptive\u000a      metadata. The research design and implementation has been overseen by a\u000a      steering group including four staff members of Celtic &amp; Scottish\u000a      Studies (C&amp;SS) at the University of Edinburgh: Dr Cathlin\u000a      Macaulay (SSA Archivist), Dr Margaret Mackay (Senior Lecturer until 2010,\u000a      thereafter Hon.

Underpinning this project has been scholarship on how to\u000a      analyse folkloristic and ethnomusicological genres, how to contextualise\u000a      these genres by reference to a range of external source materials and how\u000a      to design and deliver a major online research resource. This constitutes a\u000a      decisive contribution to the intellectual infrastructure of the fields of\u000a      Celtic Studies, Ethnology and Intangible Cultural Heritage (3.1, 3.2).\u000a    The Greig-Duncan Folk Song Collection\u000a    Originating in Aberdeenshire, this is the largest collection of Lowland\u000a      Scots song ever published. The research underpinning vols 5-8 (published\u000a      1993-2003, see 3.3) involved systematic scholarly editing of a disparate\u000a      collection of manuscript materials dating from the early twentieth\u000a      century: folksongs, including associated correspondence, newspaper\u000a      articles and other paratexts. Volumes 5-8 of the collection comprise over\u000a      1,000 separate folk songs, with notes on each song, including references\u000a      to known analogues, and the collectors' own comments. Dr Emily Lyle\u000a      (Senior Research Fellow) was PI. Dr Katherine Campbell (AHRB Research\u000a      Fellow, 2000-02, Lecturer 2005-12, Senior Lecturer 2012-) was a co-author\u000a      of volume 8, which contains analytical studies by Campbell of the music in\u000a      the collection, and by Lyle of the collection's formation. Taken together,\u000a      volumes 5-8 comprise over 2,500 pages of research materials. The\u000a      publication of the collection and of an additional Selection for\u000a        Performers (3.4) has radically altered perceptions of the scope and\u000a      importance of regional song in North-East Scotland.\u000a    The Survivals and Revivals Project\u000a    West leads this research strand, which by analysing the interactions\u000a      between survivals of older styles and revivals by contemporary musicians,\u000a      draws together archival material in SSA and new field-based research. From\u000a      2008-13, a key element of this research has been West's recording, through\u000a      participant observation techniques, of a modern revival in piping and\u000a      singing in progress. This breaks new methodological ground. West's\u000a      work as an internationally recognised performer and broadcaster\u000a      integrates, as practice-based research, with this method. The main\u000a      research findings to date concern lowland bellows-blown piping techniques,\u000a      styles and repertoires, and the importance of key individuals to the\u000a      revival process (3.1, 3.2).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24009","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A key requirement of the Gaelic Language Act is the obligation on public\u000d\u000a      bodies to produce Gaelic language plans, when requested by B&#242;rd na\u000d\u000a      G&#224;idhlig.

Professor Wilson McLeod (appointed\u000d\u000a      Lecturer 2001, Professor 2013-) has studied and animated the policy\u000d\u000a      process leading to the adoption of legislative protection for Gaelic. His\u000d\u000a      research, and also his involvement in working groups and policy reports\u000d\u000a      for Gaelic agencies, played an important role in making the case for the\u000d\u000a      Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act that was passed in 2005.\u000d\u000a    The Act aims to \"secure the status of Gaelic as an official language of\u000d\u000a      Scotland commanding equal respect to the English language\". To this end,\u000d\u000a      it established a language planning board, B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig, which must\u000d\u000a      produce a National Gaelic Language Plan every five years. Since 2005,\u000d\u000a      McLeod's academic research has placed the new policy infrastructure for\u000d\u000a      Gaelic emerging in the mid-2000s in the longer historical context of\u000d\u000a      Gaelic development and in the international context of minority language\u000d\u000a      planning (3.1). He has also assessed the strategic opportunities presented\u000d\u000a      by the Gaelic Language Act, suggesting ways in which it might be most\u000d\u000a      effectively implemented, while analysing the strengths and weaknesses of\u000d\u000a      the first statutory Gaelic language plans developed by public bodies in\u000d\u000a      Scotland (3.2, 3.6).\u000d\u000a    Based on his outstanding record of research concerning the implementation\u000d\u000a      of language legislation, and also his involvement in policy-making, in\u000d\u000a      2010 the B&#242;rd commissioned McLeod to prepare a detailed evaluation of the\u000d\u000a      first nine statutory language plans adopted by Scottish public\u000d\u000a      authorities. This work dovetails with his academic publications on the\u000d\u000a      implementation of the Gaelic Language Act (e.g. 3.5), which uses theoretical\u000a        frameworks in language planning (e.g. Strubell's \"Catherine wheel\"\u000d\u000a      model) to analyse the strategic capacities of different kinds of bodies to\u000d\u000a      enhance their provision for Gaelic and contribute meaningfully to Gaelic\u000d\u000a      revitalisation.\u000d\u000a    Another major strand of McLeod's research centres on Gaelic-language\u000d\u000a      education, from pre-school to adult learners, and involves collaboration\u000d\u000a      with Dr Fiona O'Hanlon (Research Fellow C&amp;SS, appointed Sept. 2010),\u000d\u000a      Professor Lindsay Paterson (School of Social and Political Science,\u000d\u000a      appointed 1998), and partners from the Universities of Stirling and\u000d\u000a      Strathclyde (see e.g. 3.4). Most recently, O'Hanlon, Paterson and McLeod\u000d\u000a      have researched language models used in the delivery of Gaelic\u000d\u000a        education, discovering a significant degree of variation in practice\u000d\u000a      among schools, which was previously unrealised by providers and\u000d\u000a      policy-makers (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/nurg5al).\u000a      Led by O'Hanlon, this report builds on their research and resultant\u000d\u000a      co-authored journal article (2012) on the attainment levels of bilingual\u000d\u000a      pupils educated through Gaelic (3.3). Funded by the ESRC, the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government and the B&#242;rd, O'Hanlon and Paterson have also conducted\u000d\u000a      research on public attitudes to the Gaelic language in Scotland;\u000d\u000a      O'Hanlon developed a special module of questions that were used in the\u000d\u000a      2012 Scottish Social Attitudes Survey, an authoritative study conducted\u000d\u000a      annually by ScotCen Social Research (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/ofq95wl).\u000a      Her expertise in the field of Gaelic policy and Gaelic education (3.3)\u000d\u000a      enabled the creation of questions that inform academic and policy debate\u000d\u000a      about the place of Gaelic in Scotland.\u000d\u000a    As a result of this research expertise at the University of Edinburgh, in\u000d\u000a      2009-10 B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig and the Scottish Government commissioned\u000d\u000a      C&amp;SS, following a competitive tendering process, to carry out three\u000d\u000a      reviews on 1) adult education, 2) Gaelic-medium primary and\u000d\u000a        secondary education and 3) Gaelic early years education\u000d\u000a      (this report was carried out with the University of Stirling; McLeod\u000d\u000a      contributed expertise on the Gaelic language in the education sector).

(Telling\u000a      experienced professionals about the nature of their own work is\u000a      potentially offensive and counter-\u000a      productive; hence the importance of the comparative method and analogy.)\u000a      This took place in two\u000a      phases:\u000a    a) in the major Teaching Hospital in Grenoble (Oct. 2011), where Rogers\u000a      took a leading role in the\u000a      \"Semaine de l'Encadrement\", a week-long professional development\u000a      conference at the IFCS.\u000a    b) at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques (IEP) in Grenoble (April\u000a      and Dec. 2011), where Rogers led\u000a      seminars within the professional training programme for CdS in the region\u000a      (4 groups of 20\u000a      participants), in conjunction with the development programmes provided by\u000a      the IFCS.\u000a    Participants at both sets of seminars were persuaded to see themselves as\u000a      policy \"translators\",\u000a      who must understand and appropriate the varying forms of \"grammar\"\u000a      available in order to provide\u000a      the most effective translation of centrally formulated policy into local\u000a      action. This was illustrated\u000a      through discussion of different modes of appropriating (\"translating\")\u000a      modernisation norms, as well\u000a      as the different ways in which \"regulation\" (economic or social) can be\u000a      interpreted. Rogers drew\u000a      attention to the danger of confusion between means and ends in the focus\u000a      on the attainment of\u000a      quantified targets: the risk of the ethical \"wood\" becoming obscured by\u000a      the \"trees\" of technocracy.\u000a      This risk, which CdS mentioned as a concern, figured prominently in\u000a      Rogers's keynote address to\u000a      the Semaine de l'Encadrement.\u000a    Monika Steffen, Director of the Professional Masters Programme in Public\u000a      Health Policy and\u000a      Management at the IEP, acknowledged the impact of Rogers's comparative\u000a      approach on health\u000a      care professionals, stating that \"through comparison with changes taking\u000a      place elsewhere\", they\u000a      had gained \"insights into the developments taking place within their own\u000a      system and work\u000a      environment\", which \"deepened their understanding of the challenges which\u000a      they face in their\u000a      professional lives\" (5.1).\u000a    During the Semaine de l'Encadrement, Rogers also created a CdS Forum (in\u000a      the form of two\u000a      3-hour workshops), inspired by the Modern Matron Forum, which he analysed\u000a      in his research on\u000a      the NHS (3.2). The forum afforded CdS a rare opportunity collectively to\u000a      confront the causes and\u000a      effects of their malaise. Rogers introduced a text which structured the\u000a      discussion; this approach\u000a      encouraged intense engagement, as CdS shared their experiences concerning\u000a      the problems of\u000a      stress, isolation and \"estrangement\" from the professional nursing body to\u000a      which they initially\u000a      belonged. They also discussed how they coped with contradictory pressures\u000a      in the workplace\u000a      (5.2).\u000a    Stage 2 of engagement with healthcare professionals developed out of\u000a      these activities. The\u000a      Grenoble IFCS invited Rogers to return to their institution in April 2012,\u000a      to contribute to training\u000a      programmes for senior nursing staff who were about to move into front-line\u000a      management as CdS.\u000a      This invitation represented an opportunity to exert influence on the\u000a      attitudes and understanding of\u000a      CdS before they became enmeshed in the administrative \"machine\". Rogers's\u000a      contribution to\u000a      these programmes was informed by the insights he had gained from \"getting\u000a      inside\" the\u000a      organisation. The Grenoble IFCS is the major training centre for CdS in\u000a      the southern part of the\u000a      region. It provides many hospitals with their front-line nursing managers,\u000a      who impart the lessons\u000a      learned in training at the IFCS to their colleagues within these other\u000a      institutions. In a 3-hour\u000a      session with 49 trainee CdS, attended by the Training Officer responsible\u000a      for the design of their\u000a      training programme, Rogers communicated and demonstrated the potential of\u000a      the micro-projects\u000a      integrated into their training programmes for building policy-moulding\u000a      capacity. This session has\u000a      impacted the conceptualisation of training programmes in the region (5.3).\u000a    Building on stage 2, stage 3 began in 2013. Rogers was invited to return\u000a      to the Institute in April\u000a      2013, not only to reinforce his insights with a new cohort of 50 CdS\u000a      trainees, but also to evaluate\u000a      the CdS training programme, as it feeds into the professional practice of\u000a      newly-qualified CdS.\u000a      Rogers has thus spread the message that professionals throughout the\u000a      implementation chain are\u000a      not mere objects of policy, but actors, whose policy translations can have\u000a      a vital influence on the\u000a      conduct of change in healthcare provision.\u000a    The following excerpts (anonymous and translated from French), are an\u000a      indicative sample of\u000a      comments provided by participant trainees after this latest visit:\u000a    \"Your presentation changed my thinking about the potential for front-line\u000a      managers to adapt\u000a      quality performance instruments, using them as a means, rather than an\u000a      end.\"\u000a    \"I found the presentation by Vaughan Rogers particularly interesting and\u000a      thank him for helping me\u000a      to reflect on my professional role, especially the need for caution with\u000a      evaluation mechanisms\u000a      which create an image of our work that does not fit with reality.\"\u000a    \"I particularly appreciated the instructive comparison with another\u000a      country. This presentation was a\u000a      warning, leading me to reflect on the participation of Cadres in the\u000a      construction of norms and\u000a      indicators, to avoid being subjected to their dictatorial authority\"\u000a      (5.4).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Front-line nursing managers in French hospitals are often perceived, by\u000a      themselves and others,\u000a      as cogs in an administrative machine, trapped between conflicting demands\u000a      for increased\u000a      economic efficiency and health-care quality.

This\u000a      research underpins his work with French nursing managers and has produced\u000a      publications, co-\u000a      authored with Philippe Moss&#233; of the French National Scientific Research\u000a      Council (CNRS, see 3.1,\u000a      3.2, 3.3).\u000a    Rogers's work on the NHS mainly involved analysis of primary and\u000a      secondary documents.\u000a      Conversely, knowledge exchange between other academics and practitioners\u000a      enriched his\u000a      research into the French system: the workshops he ran with healthcare\u000a      staff provided him with a\u000a      rare opportunity for lengthy exchanges with these professionals. \"Getting\u000a      inside\" the organisation\u000a      in this way led Rogers to a better understanding of the nature and context\u000a      of their work.\u000a    His findings identify shortcomings in the dominant, top-down explanatory\u000a      models of change,\u000a      management and implementation. They also highlight the importance of\u000a      looking beyond the\u000a      centralised appearance of formal arrangements in order to understand the\u000a      key role of sub-central\u000a      actors in policy implementation. This approach illuminates the need for an\u000a      explanatory model that\u000a      is more open to uncertainty, critical tension and creative arrangements.\u000a    In the book co-authored with Moss&#233; et al. (3.2), Rogers analyses the\u000a      demonstrably unsatisfactory\u000a      quality of care in some NHS hospitals, such as the Mid-Staffordshire\u000a      Foundation Trust. He finds\u000a      that poor quality care is an unintended consequence of local actors'\u000a      predominant focus on\u000a      ministerial economic efficiency targets, and that the failure of\u000a      centralist regulation exacerbates this\u000a      situation further. The 2009 study (3.1) of French Regional Hospital\u000a      Agencies (Agences R&#233;gionales\u000a      d'Hospitalisation) provides a more positive illustration of how\u000a      sub-national actors can become\u000a      policy substance providers, rather than simply executors of\u000a      centrally-determined objectives.\u000a      Rogers highlights the different ways in which sub-central actors can\u000a      appropriate centrally-\u000a      determined norms, which may themselves be mutually antagonistic. The focus\u000a      on implementation\u000a      reveals how actors respond to the uncertainty resulting from such\u000a      pressures from the centre: they\u000a      construct situated compromises, for example, or even clear deviations from\u000a      official policy\u000a      objectives. Rogers finds that the outcomes of this leeway, forged from\u000a      attempts by local and\u000a      regional actors to manage such tensions and turn them into operational\u000a      practice, can be\u000a      advantageous.\u000a    At local level, a 2012 study by Rogers and Moss&#233; (3.3) of two\u000a      care-quality improvement initiatives,\u000a      one in France, one in the NHS, showed how French nursing managers (Cadres\u000a      de Sant&#233;, CdS)\u000a      and English Modern Matrons use the above leeway. In the NHS, the weakening\u000a      of nursing\u000a      management structures at the point of care delivery enables Modern\u000a      Matrons, who implement the\u000a      \"Essence of Care\" initiative, to redefine pre-established, quality-related\u000a      norms. This normative\u000a      capacity can transform formal hierarchies and influence the conduct of\u000a      other professionals,\u000a      including doctors. The capacity for influence of CdS depends on the\u000a      essential role of Nursing\u000a      Management Training Institutes (Instituts de Formation des Cadres de\u000a      Sant&#233;, IFCS): Rogers\u000a      shows how the pedagogical training activities these Institutes conceive\u000a      have significant policy\u000a      implications. Through the appropriation of micro-projects integrated into\u000a      their training programmes,\u000a      CdS participate in the co-construction of care quality norms.\u000a    Rogers's research thus demonstrates how nursing managers can be empowered\u000a      through the very\u000a      way they negotiate competing pressures, and not by the frequently\u000a      requested \"recognition\" from\u000a      the upper echelons of the hospital hierarchy, nor by direct resistance to\u000a      managerial constraints.\u000a      Guidance from front-line training structures, such as the IFCS, can\u000a      support this process of\u000a      empowerment.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24011","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Northern Lights documentary film project, which obtained &#163;250k in\u000d\u000a      grant support from Creative Scotland, was launched on 20 March 2012 by\u000d\u000a      Scottish Minister for Culture, Fiona Hyslop. The key insight of this\u000d\u000a      project is that the creation of audio-visual representations can have\u000d\u000a      transformational effects on the lives of often overlooked and culturally\u000d\u000a      contested individuals and groups. Northern Lights seeks to apply this\u000d\u000a      insight to the whole of Scotland. Going further than any previous research\u000d\u000a      project by attempting to democratise the filmmaking process, it invited\u000d\u000a      members of the public to film their own lives and communities, in any\u000d\u000a      language. Northern Lights thus gave everyone in Scotland the opportunity\u000d\u000a      to participate in the creation of a unique documentary portrait of the\u000d\u000a      nation in 2012.\u000d\u000a    Its impact was to alter the self-perceptions of minority groups in\u000d\u000a      Scotland, and also the mainstream's perception of these groups. Impact was\u000d\u000a      two-pronged: it occurred during the creative process and also afterwards,\u000d\u000a      with the release of the feature film in February 2013. Participant\u000d\u000a      responses, both to the project's preparatory workshops (5.3) and on the\u000d\u000a      project website (http:\/\/wearenorthernlights.com\/submissions\/listen\/),\u000a      testify to the ongoing impact of the creative process and finished product\u000d\u000a      on those who got involved. The project's Facebook and Twitter accounts\u000d\u000a      evidence the ongoing impact of the film on Scottish audiences (5.1).\u000d\u000a    The breadth of the impact is evident in the engagement in the project of\u000d\u000a      many different individuals and social groups. Working with the Black and\u000d\u000a      Ethnic Minority Infrastructure for Scotland (5.8) and the Scottish Mental\u000d\u000a      Health Foundation (5.7), both umbrella groups for hundreds of smaller\u000d\u000a      local organisations, Higgins enabled widespread participation by designing\u000d\u000a      a two-day intensive filmmaking workshop, so that interested parties would\u000d\u000a      know how to make their own films. He delivered 30 workshops to communities\u000d\u000a      across Scotland, and 20 two-hour introductory ideas sessions to members of\u000d\u000a      the general public. For those unable to attend, he created online\u000d\u000a      instructional video tutorials (http:\/\/wearenorthernlights.com\/get-involved\/preparing\/).\u000a      Members of the public were thus enabled to make films about \"their\u000d\u000a      Scotland\" on any format, including mobile phones, video cameras and\u000d\u000a      digital cameras. They then uploaded their footage to the Northern Lights\u000d\u000a      website.\u000d\u000a    The public buy-in to the project was extensive: by the end of the\u000d\u000a      three-month submission period the project had received over 1,500 video\u000d\u000a      submissions, generating over 300 hours of footage, clear evidence of the\u000d\u000a      reach of Higgins's workshops on diverse communities around Scotland,\u000d\u000a      including youth groups and OAPs, Chest, Heart &amp; Stroke Scotland and\u000d\u000a      groups with experience of mental health difficulties. Feedback from the\u000d\u000a      workshops testifies to a sense of empowerment felt by individuals in\u000d\u000a      getting hands-on experience of film as a representative medium: \"I've\u000d\u000a      learned a lot about cameras, how to film, what to shoot and what not to\u000d\u000a      shoot. I'd love to make more films in the future. That's the dream\" (Jamie\u000d\u000a      Price &#8212; STUC Workshop, Glasgow, 5.3). The submitted material was then\u000d\u000a      edited into a 98-minute documentary. For those who provided video\u000d\u000a      submissions, the experience of seeing their own small contribution unified\u000d\u000a      as part of a final audio-visual portrait generated a further level of\u000d\u000a      impact, as the recorded video responses and online testimony show. A\u000d\u000a      typical example of feedback is: \"Thanks to Northern Lights workshop I\u000d\u000a      discovered how to communicate my world with picture and sound!\" (Soozie\u000d\u000a      Tarkenter &#8212; Hearing disability, http:\/\/wearenorthernlights.com\/submissions\/listen\/).\u000d\u000a    The positive effects on participants are thus considerable. Higgins has\u000d\u000a      helped empower individuals to create their own personal media\u000d\u000a      representations that in the process have enriched and expanded their life\u000d\u000a      worlds and imaginations. This effect is especially important for the often\u000d\u000a      disadvantaged and marginalised groups the project targeted. In addition to\u000d\u000a      the impact of making creative and coherent audio-visual sense of their\u000d\u000a      lives, these groups have been positively affected by their inclusion in\u000d\u000a      the project (5.7, 5.8). It has enabled them literally to see themselves\u000d\u000a      alongside other members of society and thus experience a social visibility\u000d\u000a      and recognition that is rare, both in research projects and in wider\u000d\u000a      society. This comes across powerfully in their self-description as film\u000d\u000a      directors: 121 participants list themselves as film directors on the IMDb\u000d\u000a      wesbite (http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt2733992\/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ql_1).\u000d\u000a    Beyond the impact of face-to-face encounters, the Northern Lights website\u000d\u000a      was the main interface for the project. It provided video-making support,\u000d\u000a      and submissions could be viewed on the site. The site received between\u000d\u000a      2,000 and 3,500 unique visitors per day, with an overall total of 55,000\u000d\u000a      site visitors in the 3-month submission period (5.4). The project's\u000d\u000a      Facebook page and Twitter feed created an online community complementing\u000d\u000a      the project's offline activities (5.1). The Facebook page had a weekly\u000d\u000a      reach of 4,000 people, with over 250,000 people talking about the project.\u000d\u000a      The Twitter feed had 1,495 followers, with a reach of many more thousands\u000d\u000a      (5.2).\u000d\u000a    The public impact of the project can also be measured by the considerable\u000d\u000a      print and broadcast press coverage it received, including features on the\u000d\u000a      BBC, STV, Radio Scotland, The Herald, The Sun, and\u000d\u000a      The Mail on Sunday. The film was described as capturing \"the very\u000d\u000a      essence of Scotland. Unmissable\" (Evening Times, 14.2.13), \"a joy\u000d\u000a      to watch\", conveying \"a joyous sense of nationhood\", \"Scotland as it\u000d\u000a      perceives itself, with no voices silenced\" (Eye for Film, 6.2.13)\u000d\u000a      (5.5). Based on viewer and circulation figures, the project reached over 4\u000d\u000a      million people in Scotland and beyond (5.9)\u000d\u000a    The Cineworld cinema chain released the film across Scotland &#8212; the first\u000d\u000a      ever Scottish documentary to receive such distribution. It has screened in\u000d\u000a      New York as part of the Scotland-Tartan Week celebrations, and in June and\u000d\u000a      July 2013 it travelled to rural communities in Scotland with the UK's only\u000d\u000a      mobile cinema, the Screen Machine. In total it has received 196 screenings\u000d\u000a      since its premiere in February 2013. The Scottish Government Culture\u000d\u000a      Secretary has said: \"Northern Lights has set a standard for cultural\u000d\u000a      projects &#8212; it's reached out to our diverse communities and inspired them\u000d\u000a      to think about how they can use culture and creativity &#8212; not only to\u000d\u000a      promote their local identity but to enhance community engagement\" (5.6).\u000d\u000a      On 16 May 2013 the SNP passed a motion to announce that the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Parliament considered that Northern Lights, which it described as \"an\u000d\u000a      excellent initiative\", \"gives a superb range of images of Scotland, [...]\u000d\u000a      including superb scenery and socially challenging issues, such as drug\u000d\u000a      problems\" (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/olzwylf).\u000a      On 8 October 2013 BAFTA Scotland nominated Northern Lights for the\u000d\u000a      Cineworld Audience Award 2013 (5.10).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Northern Lights was a University of Edinburgh research project that\u000d\u000a      engaged members of the Scottish public in documenting their lives on\u000d\u000a      camera. Its objective was to create a novel, multi-perspective documentary\u000d\u000a      portrait of the Scottish nation in 2012. The project had enormous scope:\u000d\u000a      press and media impact reached over 4 million people. Northern Lights made\u000d\u000a      its impact by empowering the 1,500 individuals who contributed video\u000d\u000a      portraits to explore issues such as addiction, disabilities and mental\u000d\u000a      health. Northern Lights thus opened up a unique opportunity for\u000d\u000a      participants to represent their experience, voicing, for themselves and\u000d\u000a      for a wider, national audience, often poorly understood and neglected\u000d\u000a      sectors of society.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    The University of Edinburgh\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Edinburgh (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Edinburgh","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007790}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Links archived at http:\/\/www.wiki.ed.ac.uk\/display\/REF2014REF3B\/UoA+28A\u000d\u000a    \u000aDocumentary Films:\u000d\u000a      3.1 Northern Lights, 2013. www.wearenorthernlights.com\u000d\u000a      Evidence of Quality: Creative Scotland, the National Lottery and\u000d\u000a      the Mental Health Foundation awarded Higgins a \"Once in a Lifetime\" grant\u000d\u000a      of &#163;260k (March 2012 &#8212; Jan. 2013) for this project.\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000a3.2 PI on feature-length documentary (with co-directors Tilda Swinton,\u000d\u000a      Irvine Welsh, Douglas Gordon et al.), The New Ten Commandments: www.newtencommandments.co.uk\u000d\u000a      Evidence of Quality: Scottish Screen, the Scottish Arts Council and\u000d\u000a      BBC Scotland awarded Higgins a grant of &#163;285k for this project (Feb. 2008\u000d\u000a      &#8212; Dec. 2008).\u000d\u000a      Awards:\u000d\u000a      Winner Best Broadcast Award, Refugee Festival, Scotland 2009.\u000d\u000a      Winner Student Jury Award, DokumentART Film Festival, Germany &amp; Poland\u000d\u000a      2009.\u000d\u000a      Screenings:\u000d\u000a      Invited to Screen at the Scottish Parliament in 2009; Theatrical Release:\u000d\u000a      14 cinemas in Scotland (Dec. 2000 &#8212; Feb. 2009); broadcast on BBC Scotland\u000d\u000a      (Dec. 2008); screened at international festivals including premiere at the\u000d\u000a      EIFF in 2008, which was attended by the Minister of Culture.\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000a3.3 A Massacre Foretold, 2008: www.massacreforetold.com\u000d\u000a      Evidence of Quality: This film won the WAAC\/SIGNIS Best Human\u000d\u000a      Rights Film Award 2007 and was Nominated Sky Movies Documentary Award, UK\u000d\u000a      2007.

Questions of mental health, addiction,\u000d\u000a      ethnicity and identity drive his documentary research as well as his\u000d\u000a      written research. Emphasising the creative participation of the film\u000d\u000a      subjects in the filmmaking process, Higgins encourages the\u000d\u000a      self-articulation of marginalised social groups; subsequent screenings\u000d\u000a      have produced the further impact of creating empathy in audiences from\u000d\u000a      across the social spectrum for the experiences of these groups.\u000d\u000a    An early documentary project, Women in Black (2004) explored the\u000d\u000a      challenge of representing a silent, women-only peace protest movement.\u000d\u000a      Higgins sought to capture their experience in documentary form, which\u000d\u000a      resulted in a film that was broadcast on television (2004), a screening at\u000d\u000a      the Nobel Peace Awards in Oslo (2005) and, immediately following\u000d\u000a      broadcast, the creation of three new protest groups in cities across\u000d\u000a      Scotland. The positive impact this research generated inspired Higgins to\u000d\u000a      use the documentary form in another project on the creative and emotional\u000d\u000a      life of the schizophrenic artist extraordinaire, Angus MacPhee. This work\u000d\u000a      won several awards, including best documentary at the Britspotting\u000d\u000a      Festival in Berlin in 2005, and has been viewed by over 3 million people\u000d\u000a      worldwide. Mental health professionals in the UK and USA continue to use\u000d\u000a      the film as a means to explore art and mental illness.\u000d\u000a    In 2007, Higgins completed the film A Massacre Foretold, the\u000d\u000a      result of 5 years of research on the massacre in 1997 of 45 unarmed\u000d\u000a      Indians in Acteal, Mexico (3.3). The feature-length documentary premiered\u000d\u000a      at the Edinburgh International Film Festival (EIFF), screened at\u000d\u000a      over 40 international festivals, has been broadcast on 4 international\u000d\u000a      television stations, and in 2007 won the WAAC\/SIGNIS Award for best Human\u000d\u000a      Rights Documentary.\u000d\u000a    Higgins's interest in the representation of human rights issues led to a\u000d\u000a      further award-winning film in 2008, The New Ten Commandments, a\u000d\u000a      documentary response to the question of individual Human Rights in\u000d\u000a      Scotland (3.2). This project gathered together ten co-directors, including\u000d\u000a      Oscar winner Tilda Swinton and Turner Prize winner Douglas Gordon, and\u000d\u000a      produced an educational publication (3.5).\u000d\u000a    The BAFTA Scotland-nominated Northern Lights (2012), his most ambitious\u000d\u000a      project yet, is the result of several years of refining this approach to\u000d\u000a      documentary film as research tool and output simultaneously (3.1, 5.10).\u000d\u000a      The findings of Higgins's practice-based research are thus twofold: first,\u000d\u000a      they reflect on documentary film as an invaluable research tool for\u000d\u000a      gaining knowledge about neglected social groups; second, because the means\u000d\u000a      of the filmmaking process encourages the creative participation of these\u000d\u000a      groups, the end product of the film captures in a unique manner the voices\u000d\u000a      of the marginalized.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24012","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"630336","Name":"Belarus"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Laura Bradley provided the research input on East German censorship for The\u000d\u000a        Stasi Are Among\u000d\u000a        Us, a two-day event at the Glasgow Film Festival (21-22 February\u000d\u000a      2011) that was conceived and\u000d\u000a      curated by the University of Edinburgh. Susan Kemp (UoE Film Studies)\u000d\u000a      initiated the project and\u000d\u000a      secured its place in the Festival programme; she then co-organized the\u000d\u000a      event with Bradley and\u000d\u000a      Fiona Rintoul (freelance journalist and novelist). The event included six\u000d\u000a      screenings of films by the\u000d\u000a      directors Thomas Heise, Claus L&#246;ser, Hannes Sch&#246;nemann and Rainer Simon,\u000d\u000a      and readings by\u000d\u000a      the writers Johannes Jansen and Gabriele St&#246;tzer (5.4). It was sponsored\u000d\u000a      by the DEFA-Stiftung, a\u000d\u000a      German foundation dedicated to the promotion of GDR film (&#8364;3k); the\u000d\u000a      University of Edinburgh\u000d\u000a      Knowledge Exchange Fund (&#163;4.3k); Gutter magazine (sponsorship in\u000d\u000a      kind); and Glasgow Life\u000d\u000a      (&#163;300).\u000d\u000a    The findings of Bradley's research were crucial for the way in which the\u000d\u000a      event was conceptualised,\u000d\u000a      presented, and run. These findings demanded that the event should present\u000d\u000a      a nuanced view of\u000d\u000a      censorship: the title The Stasi Are Among Us was designed to show\u000d\u000a      the insidious nature of\u000d\u000a      censorship and artists' involvement in censorship processes. Bradley\u000d\u000a      chaired a discussion with\u000d\u000a      Sch&#246;nemann and Simon called \"Working Creatively Under Dictatorship\", and\u000d\u000a      her research on\u000d\u000a      GDR censorship and Stasi surveillance enabled her to elicit key\u000d\u000a      information from the directors and\u000d\u000a      set their comments in context for a non-specialist audience. Bradley and\u000d\u000a      Kemp also published a\u000d\u000a      20-page pamphlet featuring an introduction by Kemp, a 1,300-word essay by\u000d\u000a      Bradley on the GDR\u000d\u000a      authorities' denial of censorship and its impact on control of the\u000d\u000a      performing arts, and information\u000d\u000a      prepared by Bradley on the directors' biographies (see 5.4 below). Bradley\u000d\u000a      collated material from\u000d\u000a      the directors' Stasi files for a wall display, and she produced\u000d\u000a      information sheets on the directors\u000d\u000a      and the censorship of their films (5.4). Allison Gardner, the Artistic\u000d\u000a      Director of the Glasgow Film\u000d\u000a      Festival, comments that this material was \"a level above\" what the\u000d\u000a      Festival would usually provide:\u000d\u000a      the materials gave the audiences \"added ownership\" of the event and\u000d\u000a      \"engaged them in a way\u000d\u000a      that was really important\" (5.1). Without Bradley's research input, the\u000d\u000a      Glasgow Film Festival would\u000d\u000a      not have been able to address such a complex topic, in the presence of\u000d\u000a      directors personally\u000d\u000a      affected by Stasi surveillance and harassment.\u000d\u000a    The Glasgow Film Festival sold 350 tickets to sessions at the event\u000d\u000a      (5.5), and the University's\u000d\u000a      Stasi Are Among Us website received 1,648 hits (5.6). The event\u000d\u000a      attracted new visitors to the Film\u000d\u000a      Festival and the venue: 56.4% of respondents to audience questionnaires\u000d\u000a      stated that it was their\u000d\u000a      first ever visit to the Glasgow Film Festival, and 51.3% said that it was\u000d\u000a      their first ever visit to the\u000d\u000a      Centre for Contemporary Arts (5.3). 94.9% said that they had learned more\u000d\u000a      about GDR culture\u000d\u000a      and\/or censorship from the event (5.3). Allison Gardner argues that\u000d\u000a      \"giving the audience\u000d\u000a      something different that stretched them was a good thing\" (5.1). She\u000d\u000a      explains: \"bringing the\u000d\u000a      research, the filmmakers and the films together for the public gave\u000d\u000a      another dimension. It gave\u000d\u000a      them an insight into a life that [...] was completely different from their\u000d\u000a      own. And it brought\u000d\u000a      everybody together in a communal space where they could share those ideas,\u000d\u000a      share their lives,\u000d\u000a      share their stories\" (5.1). She comments that the audience \"asked really\u000d\u000a      engaging questions. They\u000d\u000a      thought about the films and obviously knew a little bit about the history,\u000d\u000a      perhaps from seeing The\u000d\u000a        Lives of Others at the Glasgow Film Theatre. But this was something\u000d\u000a      completely different. This\u000d\u000a      was real life, and that was fantastic\" (5.1). Responses to the audience\u000d\u000a      questionnaire indicate that\u000d\u000a      viewers were particularly interested in seeing how censorship worked\u000d\u000a      through human interaction\u000d\u000a      and how innocuous the criticisms in the films seem now, and in hearing the\u000d\u000a      directors' personal\u000d\u000a      accounts of their experiences (5.3). One respondent wrote: \"It's brilliant\u000d\u000a      to see an event like this at\u000d\u000a      the Glasgow Film Festival &#8212; a real privilege to get to see these films and\u000d\u000a      hear from the directors\"\u000d\u000a      (5.3). As a result of the event's success, Gardner chose \"Welcome to\u000d\u000a      Germany\" as the country\u000d\u000a      focus for the 2012 Festival and invited Kemp to organize a strand entitled\u000d\u000a      \"Weimarvellous\" (5.1).\u000d\u000a    Following the event, Bradley was invited to collaborate with the\u000d\u000a      Glasgow-based company Theatre\u000d\u000a      Found on two public events campaigning against censorship of the arts. She\u000d\u000a      gave a talk on\u000d\u000a      theatre censorship at Our Narrowing World, hosted at the Tron\u000d\u000a      Theatre, Glasgow, during Scottish\u000d\u000a      Refugee Week (22 June 2011). Bradley's talk set out the challenges that\u000d\u000a      theatre poses to\u000d\u000a      censors, as well as the differences between the censorship of theatre,\u000d\u000a      film and literature. It thus\u000d\u000a      set the context for presentations by the Artistic Director of the Belarus\u000d\u000a      Free Theatre and a human\u000d\u000a      rights activist from Iran. Carrie Newman, the Artistic Director of Theatre\u000d\u000a      Found, explains that\u000d\u000a      Bradley's academic input was essential as the company was only just\u000d\u000a      starting to campaign against\u000d\u000a      censorship: \"coming from a theatre background, we had a real learning\u000d\u000a      curve [to find out] about\u000d\u000a      the subject matter\" (5.2). It was important for the company \"to have\u000d\u000a      support from the academic\u000d\u000a      side to be able to deal with questions which we weren't in a position to\u000d\u000a      answer [...]. It aided us and\u000d\u000a      the audience to feel supported\" (5.2).\u000d\u000a    Bradley created a multimedia GDR strand for Theatre Found's three-day\u000d\u000a      follow-up event on\u000d\u000a      censorship at the Forest Caf&#233; during the Edinburgh Fringe (9-11 August\u000d\u000a      2011). She prepared an\u000d\u000a      hour-long radio drama on GDR theatre censorship, entitled \"To Ban or Not\u000d\u000a      to Ban\" and recorded\u000d\u000a      by Theatre Found. The radio drama presented readings from four plays\u000d\u000a      featured in Bradley's\u000d\u000a      monograph, accompanied by readings of censorship reports on the plays and\u000d\u000a      their productions.\u000d\u000a    Bradley selected and translated this material, and she wrote a commentary\u000d\u000a      that set the extracts in\u000d\u000a      context. Newman explains that this dramatization made the material\u000d\u000a      accessible to the audience: \"it\u000d\u000a      really came to life [...] because it was being said and performed by\u000d\u000a      another human being\"; \"it was\u000d\u000a      dramatised in a manner whereby an audience could make associations and\u000d\u000a      connect with it, and\u000d\u000a      possibly in a more direct way than if they were sitting in the room\u000d\u000a      reading it\" (5.2). Bradley also\u000d\u000a      gave a talk entitled \"East German Theatre Censorship: The Role of the\u000d\u000a      Audience\" and prepared a\u000d\u000a      wall display of poems and songs in which GDR artists challenged\u000d\u000a      censorship. Newman explains\u000d\u000a      that \"the use of the audio [performances] and the displays really brought\u000d\u000a      things together: people\u000d\u000a      were able to contemplate them without feeling rushed, and they really took\u000d\u000a      the time for it and were\u000d\u000a      inspired to hear the talk too, so there were different elements that\u000d\u000a      really added to the experience\"\u000d\u000a      (5.2). By showing how censorship was dismantled recently in the GDR,\u000d\u000a      Bradley strengthened the\u000d\u000a      political argument for combating censorship in other contexts. This came\u000d\u000a      out clearly when Bradley\u000d\u000a      joined Dr John Bates (University of Glasgow) in leading a Q&amp;A session\u000d\u000a      on film clips of the work of\u000d\u000a      the Belarus Free Theatre.\u000d\u000a    On 29 September 2011, Bradley delivered a lecture at the National Library\u000d\u000a      of Scotland (NLS) on\u000d\u000a      \"The Secret of East German Censorship\", in connection with the NLS\u000d\u000a      exhibition Banned Books.\u000d\u000a      The lecture explored why the GDR authorities refused to admit that they\u000d\u000a      practised censorship, and\u000d\u000a      what implications this denial had for East German writers and theatre\u000d\u000a      practitioners; it thus\u000d\u000a      provided a distinctive perspective on censorship that complemented the\u000d\u000a      exhibition. The lecture\u000d\u000a      sold out, with 100 attendees and a waiting list of 20, and the audience\u000d\u000a      survey gave the lecture the\u000d\u000a      top rating of 5, i.e. excellent (5.7). Bradley wrote a short article on\u000d\u000a      artistic responses to the East\u000d\u000a      German ban of the Soviet news digest Sputnik, a publication held\u000d\u000a      by the NLS. The article was\u000d\u000a      published in issue 19 of the NLS magazine Discover (with a print\u000d\u000a      run of 9,000 copies) to coincide\u000d\u000a      with the exhibition (5.8).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Laura Bradley's research on GDR theatre censorship (2006-) enabled the\u000d\u000a      University of Edinburgh\u000d\u000a      to stage The Stasi are Among Us at the Glasgow Film Festival\u000d\u000a      (2011).

She\u000d\u000a      published the monograph\u000d\u000a      Cooperation and Conflict (3.1) and six peer-reviewed articles on\u000d\u000a      censorship during this period\u000d\u000a      (e.g. 3.2, 3.3, 3.4). The monograph investigates how theatre censorship\u000d\u000a      developed between the\u000d\u000a      construction and fall of the Berlin Wall, how it was practised in six\u000d\u000a      regions and how it affected\u000d\u000a      genres ranging from classical tragedy to contemporary drama. The research\u000d\u000a      draws on primary\u000d\u000a      sources from the German Federal Archive, Stasi Archive, seven regional and\u000d\u000a      city archives, and\u000d\u000a      seven theatres, plus Bradley's interviews with theatre practitioners and\u000d\u000a      censors. The sources\u000d\u000a      include policy documents, internal Party and government correspondence,\u000d\u000a      reports by Stasi\u000d\u000a      informers, prompt books, rehearsal notes, audiovisual recordings and\u000d\u000a      transcripts of post-show\u000d\u000a      discussions with spectators. No one has previously attempted a study of\u000d\u000a      GDR theatre censorship\u000d\u000a      on this scale.\u000d\u000a    Since 1990, scholars (e.g. Darnton, 1995) have emphasized the need to\u000d\u000a      replace the value\u000d\u000a      judgements typical of the Cold War with a nuanced understanding of\u000d\u000a      censorship as a process of\u000d\u000a      negotiation. Yet most recent publications on GDR performance come from\u000d\u000a      practitioners with a\u000d\u000a      vested interest in presenting theatre as a centre of resistance to the\u000d\u000a      regime. By focusing on high-profile\u000d\u000a\u0009  disputes, even academic studies (e.g. Braun, 1995; Baker, 2007)\u000d\u000a      perpetuate the notion that\u000d\u000a      conflict between censors and theatres was the norm. Bradley challenges\u000d\u000a      these assumptions by\u000d\u000a      examining cases with different outcomes, ranging from production bans,\u000d\u000a      through uneasy\u000d\u000a      compromises, to official approval. She explores how theatre practitioners\u000d\u000a      participated in\u000d\u000a      censorship and shows that conflicts ran along multiple lines, within and\u000d\u000a      between Party and state\u000d\u000a      institutions, and within theatres themselves.\u000d\u000a    Cooperation and Conflict also breaks new ground by exploring how\u000d\u000a      the authorities' denial of\u000d\u000a      censorship affected the controls on theatre, the decisions made by\u000d\u000a      officials and the room for\u000d\u000a      manoeuvre open to theatre practitioners. Censorship in the GDR was\u000d\u000a      camouflaged and exercised\u000d\u000a      through a complex web of institutions, and a euphemistic language evolved\u000d\u000a      to describe and justify\u000d\u000a      the system. By denying that censorship was practised, the regime could\u000d\u000a      hold theatre practitioners\u000d\u000a      accountable for productions even though they had been filtered through\u000d\u000a      pre-performance controls.\u000d\u000a      This exposed practitioners to considerable risks, leading some to campaign\u000d\u000a      for the legalization of\u000d\u000a      censorship. These findings have implications for our understanding of\u000d\u000a      censorship of all the arts\u000d\u000a      and media in the GDR, not just theatre.\u000d\u000a    Bradley has continued her research on GDR censorship in a series of\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed articles. In\u000d\u000a      an article recently published in the leading North American periodical Theatre\u000d\u000a        Journal, she\u000d\u000a      investigates the roles that audiences played in GDR theatre censorship.\u000d\u000a      This is an original\u000d\u000a      approach: historians of theatre censorship tend to gesture to audiences\u000d\u000a      only in passing, and\u000d\u000a      Bradley's research demonstrates the range of sources that can be used to\u000d\u000a      examine how\u000d\u000a      audiences were implicated in, and responded to, censorship. The article\u000d\u000a      explores how the GDR\u000d\u000a      authorities deployed audiences in censorship debates and tried to\u000d\u000a      influence reception processes.\u000d\u000a      It then considers how actors sought to control audience response during\u000d\u000a      live performances, before\u000d\u000a      focusing on the roles that spectators played during discussions with\u000d\u000a      theatre practitioners, as\u000d\u000a      evidenced in transcripts of rehearsal and post-show discussions. Bradley\u000d\u000a      has extended her\u000d\u000a      examination of censorship from theatre into poetry, music and film. Her\u000d\u000a      latest publications include\u000d\u000a      an article on new works of art that were produced in protest against the\u000d\u000a      GDR government's ban on\u000d\u000a      Sputnik magazine in 1988. These works of art trained their\u000d\u000a      recipients to dissect and subvert GDR\u000d\u000a      media discourse. They testify to the GDR's emerging culture of creative\u000d\u000a      protest, which advertised\u000d\u000a      dissent and lowered resistance to its expression.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24042","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact was achieved first commercially and then in a clinical\u000d\u000a      application.

Taylor (CSTR 1993-2001) founded Rhetorical\u000d\u000a      Systems in 2000, which used\u000d\u000a      Festival as the basis for its commercial product rVoice. Rhetorical\u000d\u000a      Systems was then acquired by\u000d\u000a      Nuance in 2004 for &#163;3.6 million. Taylor then founded follow-on company\u000d\u000a      Phonetic Arts in 2006; in\u000d\u000a      2010 it had a turnover of &#163;154K from products including a unit-selection\u000d\u000a      text-to-speech system\u000d\u000a      closely following the approach in Festival. Google's current speech\u000d\u000a      synthesis group was formed\u000d\u000a      by acquiring Phonetic Arts in 2010 for an undisclosed sum. As their\u000d\u000a      Technical Lead of TTS has\u000d\u000a      stated, the impact of TTS at Google is \"huge,\" with millions of unique\u000d\u000a      users of their TTS systems\u000d\u000a      every day; Festival has been \"highly influential\" for their system, and\u000d\u000a      their speech synthesizer \"has\u000d\u000a      its roots in HTS\" [5.TAY].

The first version was created in 1996 by Black\u000d\u000a      (researcher: 1996-99)\u000d\u000a      and Taylor (researcher; lecturer: 1993-2001) later joined by Caley\u000d\u000a      (developer: 1997-2001).\u000d\u000a      Festival embodies research results from CSTR produced from 1996 onwards by\u000d\u000a      Black, Taylor,\u000d\u000a      Isard (director: left 1999), Clark (PhD student; researcher; lecturer:\u000d\u000a      arrived 1996), King (PhD\u000d\u000a      student; lecturer; reader; professor; director: arrived 1993), Richmond\u000d\u000a      (PhD student; researcher:\u000d\u000a      arrived 1997), and Yamagishi (researcher; lecturer: arrived 2006). These\u000d\u000a      results include significant\u000d\u000a      advances in letter-to-sound prediction, intonation, signal processing,\u000d\u000a      unit selection, etc. (e.g.,\u000d\u000a      Taylor, Black &amp; Caley, 1998; Clark et al, 2007), and were achieved\u000d\u000a      with funding from EPSRC,\u000d\u000a      commercial sources and the EC.\u000d\u000a    The HTS toolkit is for HMM-based systems, used in conjunction\u000d\u000a      with Festival. HTS is co-maintained\u000d\u000a      by CSTR, with annual software releases embodying novel research conducted\u000d\u000a      in\u000d\u000a      CSTR and a few other groups. The key developments underpinning the claimed\u000d\u000a      impact were\u000d\u000a      made at CSTR, with funding from EPSRC and the EC, from 2006 onwards\u000d\u000a      (Yamagishi et al, 2009;\u000d\u000a      Yamagishi et al, 2010; Watts et al, 2010).\u000d\u000a    These developments concern the ability to adapt the statistical model to\u000d\u000a      new speakers using just a\u000d\u000a      few minutes of speech. The technique can be used to create speaking\u000d\u000a      styles, emotions, etc. (e.g.,\u000d\u000a      Watts et al, 2010), opening up novel applications. The major advantage of\u000d\u000a      our techniques over\u000d\u000a      existing methods is the possibility of using lower-quality recordings\u000d\u000a      (e.g., home video), less data\u000d\u000a      (minutes, not hours), and speech that is disordered (e.g., due to Motor\u000d\u000a      Neurone Disease) while\u000d\u000a      still creating normal-sounding, intelligible, personalised synthetic\u000d\u000a      speech. The key breakthrough\u000d\u000a      enabling the use of disordered speech was made at CSTR in the period\u000d\u000a      2008-2012. Initial tests\u000d\u000a      were made in collaboration with the University of Sheffield (Creer et al,\u000d\u000a      2009). CSTR deployed the\u000d\u000a      first \"voice reconstruction\" system in a clinical setting in Edinburgh in\u000d\u000a      2010.\u000d\u000a    This recent clinical application of the technology is underpinned by the\u000d\u000a      sustained earlier period\u000d\u000a      (1996-present) of work on general-purpose TTS, which has itself made a\u000d\u000a      substantial impact on a\u000d\u000a      wider range of applications including telephone services, computer games,\u000d\u000a      and facial animation,\u000d\u000a      via take-up by industry and our spinout companies, as described in section\u000d\u000a      4.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24043","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    FOUND (http:\/\/foundcollective.com)\u000a      are an Edinburgh-based band and art collective founded by Gray's Art\u000a      School graduates, Ziggy Campbell, Tommy Perman and Kev Sim, signed to the\u000a      seminal label, Chemikal Underground. FOUND's work with Kirby starts from\u000a      LEC laboratory findings and explores their relevance in a world of new\u000a      mechanisms for communication, networking, and information storage. FOUND\u000a      ask their audiences: Are we continuing a process of self-domestication?\u000a      Augmenting ourselves with new kinds of memory? Changing the ways\u000a      behaviours evolve? Does the online world, which much of human cultural\u000a      behaviour now inhabits, represent a new kind of evolutionary transition\u000a      like those we have already been through?\u000a    The impacts described below stem from the evolving practices of a\u000a      collective of artists. Unsurprisingly then, this is not a simple linear\u000a      story, so for clarity we present the impact categorised by who has\u000a      been impacted, and within each category we then provide a narrative of how\u000a      one well-defined aspect of the underpinning research has led to a specific\u000a      impact.\u000a    Artists:\u000a    Kirby has been involved with FOUND since 2007, but his collaboration only\u000a      began to have significant impact with the creation of Three Pieces\u000a      in 2008, and all the artworks described here were created between January\u000a      2008 and July 2013. Initially a significant part of the contribution that\u000a      he brought from the experimental work on cultural transmission was\u000a      technical: he helped FOUND develop much more sophisticated interactive\u000a      artworks&#8212;described below&#8212;by deploying the computational skills and\u000a      methodologies developed for laboratory experiments in the LEC. This\u000a      collaboration then led to a further and deeper exchange of ideas, with a\u000a      still-continuing discussion around the concepts of cultural evolution and\u000a      evolutionary transition that has resulted in FOUND's exploration in the\u000a      medium of art of a fundamental research finding of the LEC's work on\u000a      language evolution&#8212;the centrality of the relationship between us as a\u000a      species and our cultural products. Thus the LEC's research on language\u000a      evolution has led to a fundamental change in the art practices of the\u000a      artists who make up the FOUND collective [5.ESW; 5.NMS]. \"His [Kirby's]\u000a      involvement has had a huge impact ... I cannot imagine being able to\u000a      produce any of our subsequent installations without [it]. ... helped us to\u000a      conceptualise our work ... examine some very pertinent issues. ... added\u000a      an extra level of depth to FOUND's work ... missing before\" [5.PER].\u000a    Audiences in galleries:\u000a    The finding that the nature of social networks affects the way structured\u000a      behaviours evolve in populations inspired the creation of Cybraphon\u000a      (2009), an autonomous, emotional, robotic band similar to a Victorian\u000a      orchestrion. Cybraphon's emotional state is driven by an obsession\u000a      with its own online celebrity and online fans (it is perhaps the only\u000a      artwork likely to be emotionally affected by its citation in the REF).\u000a      This engages audiences with questions about how the social online world\u000a      changes the way we communicate, and explores our perceptions of this new\u000a      kind of social networking [5.PRE]. Cybraphon is an enormously\u000a      successful and widely-known artwork, which has attracted extensive media\u000a      coverage in books, newspapers, magazines, and television [5.PRE]. This\u000a      high visibility has in turn given Kirby the chance to explain the\u000a      relationship between artwork and research, in public talks alongside\u000a      high-profile exhibitions (Edinburgh Art Festival 2009, 2011; Glasgow\u000a      International Festival 2010; London Word Festival 2011; De La Warr\u000a      Pavilion 2011) [5.NMS], and in interviews such as the Guardian\u000a        Professional article of July 2013 [5.PRE]. Amongst other awards\u000a      [5.ESW, 5.NMS], Cybraphon won the BAFTA Scotland Best Interactive\u000a      award in 2009, the only time a piece of device art has won a BAFTA, and\u000a      its national importance was recognised in early 2013 by selection for\u000a      display in the permanent collection at the National Museum of Scotland,\u000a      the most visited UK museum outside London.\u000a    A core hypothesis in the research on the cultural transmission of\u000a      language through iterated learning is that central aspects of language as\u000a      it currently exists (such as compositionality) are the product of limitations\u000a      imposed by the nature of the network in which the system is transmitted.\u000a      This hypothesis inspired FOUND's End of Forgetting (2010), which\u000a      explores the possibility that the exponential increase in digital storage\u000a      capacity might be leading to a new transition, by effectively lifting\u000a      limitations on what can be remembered. Exhibited at the Material Rites\u000a      exhibition in Edinburgh and the Royal Society of British Sculptors in\u000a      London [5.ESW], End of Forgetting is a device that records sound,\u000a      mixing it with sound uploaded by anyone in the world, allowing visitors to\u000a      access a seemingly infinite memory. It asks: how should we live in a world\u000a      where the Internet records everything, forgets nothing? FOUND with Simon\u000a      Kirby won the LIST Award for \"outstanding contribution to Scottish art\" in\u000a      2011 against a shortlist including 2011 Turner Prize nominee Karla Black.\u000a    The research theme of limitations on human memory and how they may or may\u000a      not be overcome found further resonance with the art collective which they\u000a      realised as #UNRAVEL (http:\/\/www.unravelproject.com,\u000a      or http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/ozylun3),\u000a      involving celebrated lyricist Aidan Moffat, which invites visitors to play\u000a      records and hear stories from a Narrator's past. Despite the seemingly\u000a      reliable nature of records, the stories change, responding to audience,\u000a      environment, and online opinion, conveying the underlying notion that\u000a      memory is unreliable and constructed through interaction. This work\u000a      received a &#163;42,000 Creative Scotland Vital Spark award in 2011. It was\u000a      initially shown at Inspace (Edinburgh: Jan-Feb 2012) and the Glasgow\u000a      International Festival of Visual Art (April-May 2012). It was then invited\u000a      to the TEDGlobal exhibition (EICC, Edinburgh: June 2012). The total\u000a      audience at exhibitions in 2012 was estimated at around 1000, the 3 online\u000a      videos have over 15000 views to date (July 2013) and there was coverage in\u000a      print media [5.UNR] and two interviews on BBC Radio Scotland.\u000a    Audiences online:\u000a    Cybraphon, End of Forgetting, and #UNRAVEL all engage\u000a      online audiences, leading to a direct engagement with, and impact on, a\u000a      wider public. This is evidenced by a high volume of tweets from the\u000a      public, and Facebook friends of the art works which can be found online.\u000a      While we cannot archive tweets, Cybraphon, for example, had over 4000\u000a      Facebook friends by July 2013.\u000a    Audiences not expecting art:\u000a    The evolution of structured behaviour in populations emerging out of\u000a      individual pairwise interactions, as studied by the LEC, naturally led to\u000a      an art work in which the installation and (unsuspecting) audience formed\u000a      just such an interacting population, with unexpected emergent behaviours.\u000a      In 2008, FOUND with Kirby were commissioned to build an installation using\u000a      musical instruments with small robotic components at the Royal Botanic\u000a      Gardens Edinburgh. Three Pieces reacted to the state of the plants\u000a      and movement of visitors, leading to spontaneous and surprising\u000a      interactions between audience and artwork, as well as among audience\u000a      members [5.PRE]\u000a    Non-traditional audiences for science:\u000a    The nature of FOUND's artworks means that the collective reaches\u000a      audiences quite different to&#8212; and generally much wider than&#8212;those likely\u000a      to attend an academic talk or read about science, even \"popular\" science.\u000a      In Glasgow (May 2012) and at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2012, #UNRAVEL\u000a      was exhibited as a live robot band on stage. Audience members engaged by\u000a      tweeting opinions, which shaped the music (via an implementation of\u000a      automatic sentiment analysis). FOUND were subsequently invited to the\u000a      major art event OFFF, Barcelona 2012 (http:\/\/www.offf.ws\/2012\u000a        or http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/pc6uzo5), where they presented #UNRAVEL to an\u000a      audience of around 2000. Performances and talks relating to #UNRAVEL had a\u000a      total audience over 2,800, and exhibition attendances at least an\u000a      additional 1,000 [5.UNR].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our L[anguage] E[volution] and C[omputation] group investigates culture,\u000a      communication and social networks, focusing on language evolution.\u000a      Communicating the key concepts of cultural evolution to a general audience\u000a      is a challenge imaginatively met through Kirby's collaboration with, then\u000a      membership of, the art collective FOUND.

(2005).\u000a    LEC's primary focus is on explaining the origins and evolution of human\u000a      language, but in the course of its research, emphasis has grown on the\u000a      central importance of cultural evolution in this explanation (Kirby et al.\u000a      2007). There is a long and strong tradition of viewing language as arising\u000a      from a species-specific and domain-specific language faculty shaped\u000a      through natural selection. However, this de-emphasises the role of culture\u000a      in the evolution of language. LEC is best known for its use of\u000a      computational models (Brighton et al. 2005) and laboratory experiments\u000a      (Kirby et al. 2008) that demonstrate that cultural transmission of\u000a      language can lift the burden of explanation from biology, because language\u000a      itself is a complex adaptive system.\u000a    Beyond its impact on behaviour, cultural evolution itself may shape how a\u000a      species evolves biologically. It is widely accepted that when a species is\u000a      domesticated, many selection pressures are essentially removed, with\u000a      remarkable and rapid effects on the species' physical and cognitive\u000a      makeup. Work at LEC has recently been approaching human evolution in this\u000a      light. As shown by modelling work at LEC, culture can \"shield\" genes from\u000a      natural selection, leading to degeneration of strong innate constraints\u000a      (Kirby, Dowman &amp; Griffiths 2007, Smith &amp; Kirby 2008). By comparing\u000a      ourselves to other domesticated species, we can consider whether\u000a      self-domestication has (and continues to have) an effect on our evolution\u000a      as a species.\u000a    This research treats human evolution&#8212;biological and cultural&#8212;in terms of\u000a      major evolutionary transitions (for an overview, see Kirby's recent paper\u000a      on The evolution of linguistic replicators). These have taken\u000a      place throughout the history of life on earth whenever mechanisms for\u000a      information transmission have qualitatively changed. Our relevant research\u000a      here focuses on transitions early in human evolution; one central argument\u000a      is that the development of cultural transmission in a communication\u000a      network was the key change that made human language possible. Thus human\u000a      language is fundamentally shaped by the unique cultural networks that\u000a      characterise human society, while in turn language is the mechanism that\u000a      makes these geographically and temporally extensive networks possible.\u000a    Key findings from this underpinning research that have contributed to its\u000a      influence on FOUND's artistic output are:\u000a    \u000a      The trajectory of the biological evolution of humans has been\u000a        profoundly altered by the emergence of cultural transmission of\u000a        signalling in our species;\u000a      The stage was set for this emergence through a process of\u000a        self-domestication, through which our species shielded itself from some\u000a        of the pressures from natural selection;\u000a      The nature of our social networks affects the way structured\u000a        behaviours evolve in populations.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24044","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Sorace established Bilingualism Matters (BM) in 2008 as a\u000a      public engagement project to use the results of the research in which she\u000a      was engaged, together with other relevant results and her expertise and\u000a      standing accrued as a researcher, to combat negative public perceptions of\u000a      bilingualism. The goal of BM is to change attitudes toward\u000a      multilingualism in all sectors of society by providing research-based\u000a      information in an engaging way. Working towards this challenging goal, BM's\u000a      outreach has had a significant and wide-reaching impact, changing\u000a      attitudes in individuals and strongly influencing educationalists, health\u000a      professionals and policy-makers, within and beyond the UK [5.STA]. BM\u000a      crucially draws on the research described above, but also on the\u000a      researchers' knowledge of the whole field; Sorace's reputation as a\u000a      research leader has given her the credibility to engage convincingly with\u000a      the public, from parents to policymakers.\u000a    BM has grown rapidly in the UK and across Europe, with events,\u000a      consultations with stakeholders, responses to 800+ requests for advice in\u000a      this period and substantial media coverage in British and European\u000a      national newspapers, radio, and television [5.MED]. Individuals have\u000a      confirmed the effect of BM events on their knowledge of and\u000a      attitudes to bilingualism. A questionnaire sent out in 2012 to 90\u000a      individuals representing a wide range of organisations that had hosted a BM\u000a      event achieved a 70% response rate. 89% of respondents \"learnt things\u000a      about bilingualism [they] did not know before\", 91% \"discussed\u000a      bilingualism with colleagues as a result\", 87% had become \"more aware\u000a      [...] bilingualism is a resource\", most \"changed the way [they] relate to\u000a      bilingual children and families\", 73% sought information on bilingualism,\u000a      80% visited the website [5.QUE].\u000a    In what follows we break down the range of impact according to the\u000a      targeted constituencies:\u000a    Families and teachers\u000a    Sorace and others involved in BM have given over 60 talks to\u000a      teachers, parents, children, community groups and cultural institutions,\u000a      which have raised awareness of the benefits of bilingualism among local\u000a      monolingual and immigrant parents. After a talk to 150 students from 5\u000a      Scottish schools, one Head of Modern Languages commented \"Having some\u000a      solid evidence to support the hunch that the learning of languages is a\u000a      good thing can only help the cause of those seeking to promote the\u000a      learning and teaching of languages [...] The existence of BM and\u000a      its promotion of the research it undertakes seems to me essential\"\u000a      [5.STA]. In 2010 Sorace was invited to Brussels by the European Commission\u000a      to give advice on setting up the Piccolingo campaign promoting\u000a      multilingualism. Later that year, BM organised two events in\u000a      Edinburgh with the City of Edinburgh Council, SCILT (Scotland's National\u000a      Centre for Languages), Edinburgh Beltane, and consulates [5.DOW]. Sorace\u000a      led the Scottish partnership in an EU-funded Lifelong Learning project\u000a      that supported children learning a language with their parents; a\u000a      follow-up project recently funded by the EU for three years will take the\u000a      message to schools and immigrant families.\u000a    As part of the University's global strategy, BM and \"Edinburgh\u000a      City of Learning\" also trialled second language learning for pre-school\u000a      and primary children in 9 schools, extending their reach to early second\u000a      language learners from monolingual families. Sending students into schools\u000a      changed those students' attitudes too. The whole project was evaluated\u000a      very positively by HMIe [5.ECL] and a new project run by BM in\u000a      collaboration with official agencies is specifically focused on\u000a      introducing Chinese to first year primary school children. According to\u000a      the convenor of the Scotland China Education Network (one of the partners)\u000a      \"BM [...] makes accessible to practitioners in schools the\u000a      importance of early language exposure and learning and the underpinning\u000a      research. This is what we all hope for from the collaboration between\u000a      universities and schools [...] of which BM is a shining model\"\u000a      [5.STA].\u000a    Health professionals\u000a    If bilingual families are to be encouraged to bring up bilingual\u000a      children, it is crucial that they are not discouraged by contrary advice\u000a      from health professionals such as paediatricians and speech &amp; language\u000a      therapists, who are often unaware of the latest research results on\u000a      bilingualism. In Scotland, BM has provided specific CPD training\u000a      for speech therapists (Murray Royal Hospital, Perth, 2009) and the\u000a      Scottish Childminding Association (2010), and for paediatricians, midwives\u000a      and other health professionals at the hospital of Palmanova del Friuli,\u000a      Italy (2013). Numbers of participants at each event ranged from 20 to 70.\u000a    Policy makers and influential organisations\u000a    Members of BM have organised over 100 information seminars for\u000a      organisations including the European Central Bank, Council of Europe,\u000a      European Commission, and ESRC. These have communicated the benefits of\u000a      bilingualism for businesses and the economy. Sorace has also been\u000a      consulted extensively by the Scottish Government. The Chair of the\u000a      Scottish Government's Working Group on Languages recognised the influence\u000a      of Sorace's input to the group's recommendations, now being implemented in\u000a      the Scottish Government's \"1+2\" plan to introduce two languages in primary\u000a      schools: \"We were greatly impressed by [your work on bilingualism and\u000a      early language learning], which, together with your own research and other\u000a      related research which you pointed us towards, greatly informed the\u000a      thinking and work of the group.\" [5.EER; 5.STA]. Partnerships in Scotland\u000a      between BM and the English as an Additional Language (EAL) Service\u000a      of Edinburgh council, and Children in Scotland, have influenced public\u000a      policy on language learning, reinforcing the message that the home\u000a      languages of immigrant families should be treated as a rich resource; BM\u000a      seminars are often integrated in EAL and Children in Scotland's regular\u000a      provision for staff in-service training and parent workshops [5.EAL].\u000a    Employers\u000a    A successful event with the RSA at the Scottish Parliament, targeting the\u000a      private sector, led to a high-profile event jointly organised by the Financial\u000a        Times and BM in London in February 2013, reported in an\u000a      extended article on 14 March 2013 [5.FTI]. Attendees, including\u000a      high-ranking personnel from Shell, HSBC, Deloitte, Deutsche Bank and\u000a      McKinsey, reported afterwards on the new insights that they had gained\u000a      (\"presentation and discussions on multilingualism were thought provoking;\u000a      particularly in the part this plays in developing people, including\u000a      leaders, with more agile brains, rather than simply an ability to speak\u000a      particular languages\"; \"From my point of view it could not have been more\u000a      interesting, helpful and topical. As I explained, I am determined to find\u000a      a way of embedding language-learning in the development of young people\"\u000a      [5.STA].\u000a    Regional and global language communities:\u000a    BM reaches across Europe via a network of six branches, created\u000a      with other people&#8212;proof that BM is a model that inspires. Branches\u000a      operate in Troms&#248;, Norway; Western Isles, Scotland; Thessaloniki, Greece;\u000a      Trento, Sardinia and Siena, Italy. A seventh branch opens in Reading in\u000a      December 2013. Six more are planned for 2014 as a result of the EU\/FP7\u000a      AThEME grant. As acknowledged publicly on their websites, BM was\u000a      also the acknowledged source of inspiration for the Cambridge Bilingualism\u000a      Network and the Ulster Centre for Multilingualism. Branches coordinate\u000a      with BM to provide advice to local communities, including\u000a      supporting bilingualism with regional minority languages.\u000a    Working together with B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig, BM has influenced Gaelic\u000a      policy in Scotland by providing the impetus for the Curriculum of\u000a      Excellence for Gaelic, a central component of the government's Gaelic\u000a      plan; the official report stresses the importance of BM and\u000a      Sorace's work on bilingualism in several places (\"The research on the\u000a      attainment of [Gaelic Medium Education] pupils and the work of Prof.\u000a      Antonella Sorace, University of Edinburgh, with local authorities, are\u000a      fundamental to the continuing growth of GME and the message of the\u000a      benefits of bilingualism\", and cites her extensively [5.GRE]; the Director\u000a      of Education, Culture and Sport at the Highland Council also recognised\u000a      the impact of the research (\"The research carried out on bilingualism by\u000a      the University of Edinburgh has been enormously helpful for the Highland\u000a      Council in supporting [a] strong and positive message about the benefits\u000a      of bilingualism through [GME]\" [5.STA]).\u000a    Sorace's presentations of her research results, together with the work of\u000a      the local branch of BM, has also led to notable changes in\u000a      Sardinian language policy (e.g. the setting up of training courses for\u000a      Sardinian teachers as preparation for the introduction of Sardinian as a\u000a      medium of instruction in bilingual schools) [5.COR].\u000a    Increasingly, having become aware of the relevance of the results of the\u000a      primary research, institutions are commissioning BM to carry out\u000a      further research on their language communities (e.g. Regione Sardegna;\u000a      Scotland China Education Network), a very welcome development.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Bilingualism Matters (BM) was set up as a proactive public\u000a      engagement programme by Prof. Antonella Sorace in order to make the\u000a      results of her research, showing the benefits of bilingualism, accessible\u000a      and useful to the general public.

Researchers here have contributed important results on the role\u000a      played over the lifespan by factors such as age of first exposure to a\u000a      second language, quality and quantity of input received, and degree of\u000a      similarity between the two languages (e.g. grants 6 and 7 overleaf).\u000a      Further, Edinburgh is unique in bringing together two traditionally\u000a      separate strands of research&#8212;from linguistics and cognitive psychology&#8212;in\u000a      exploring the interaction of language and general cognition for the\u000a      development and use of particular language structures (e.g. grant 2).\u000a      Recent relevant projects have included: language and processing in\u000a      school-age children; simultaneous vs. consecutive early bilingualism;\u000a      effects of L2 learning by children and parents together; effects of\u000a      bilingualism on general cognition at different ages of exposure to L2;\u000a      implications of enhanced cognitive control in early and late bilinguals;\u000a      relationship between early bilingualism and cognitive ageing.\u000a    While bilinguals on average tend to have smaller vocabularies and slower\u000a      lexical access than monolinguals, Sorace's group has demonstrated that\u000a      older bilingual children, exposed to two languages from birth, achieve\u000a      similar levels of grammatical development in both languages as\u000a      monolinguals (Sorace &amp; Serratrice 2009; Sorace et al. 2009), at the\u000a      same time showing processing inefficiency in particular language areas.\u000a      Their recent research comparing simultaneous and successive bilingualism\u000a      in childhood indicates selective differences for some aspects of language\u000a      depending on whether L2 exposure happens before or after age 4 (Unsworth\u000a      et al. 2012); this points to the importance and effectiveness of early L2\u000a      learning in pre-school years and motivates efforts to influence attitudes\u000a      and policies regarding bilingualism. This body of findings motivated the\u000a      establishment of Bilingualism Matters and, together with the\u000a      researchers' first-hand knowledge of the broader research background,\u000a      forms the basis for the dissemination and awareness-raising activities in\u000a      the community by Sorace and the other members of the BM team.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24045","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"366755","Name":"Sudan"},{"GeoNamesId":"7909807","Name":"South Sudan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our work on language resource development has benefitted the speakers of\u000a      these languages in several ways.\u000a    Orthography development: The most significant impact is due to\u000a      Ladd's proposal for improvement of Dinka orthography: Orthographic\u000a        reform in Dinka: some general considerations and a proposal (http:\/\/www.lel.ed.ac.uk\/~bob\/orth.posted.pdf),\u000a      developed 2010-11. The orthographic representation of Dinka presents\u000a      serious challenges. The existing system has problems representing tone and\u000a      vowel length, and this causes ambiguity and interferes with communication,\u000a      affecting education and development. Consultation with [text removed for\u000a      publication], South Sudan, suggested that complicating the writing system\u000a      with full-scale markup using diacritics was unacceptable to language\u000a      users. Moreover, any case for change had to acknowledge the lack of a\u000a      functioning educational system to implement it. Ladd's proposal was\u000a      pragmatic, based on a central principle: limit change to areas of greatest\u000a      confusion.\u000a    In March 2011 Ladd's proposal was disseminated to stakeholders including\u000a      the Dinka Language Development Association (DILDA), SIL Sudan, and South\u000a      Sudan government education officials, with a significant impact on the\u000a      debate on orthography development [5.SIL]. Notably, DILDA initially\u000a      envisioned a complete disambiguation of lexical and morphological\u000a      grammatical contrasts, but have now adopted Ladd's proposals and advocate\u000a      a more limited set of modifications [5.DIL].\u000a    Child literacy: As is often the case in minority languages,\u000a      previous efforts to produce materials for Dinka and Shilluk centered on\u000a      Bible translation. But such translations are not the most useful for\u000a      language learners, especially children. On the basis of our work on\u000a      Shilluk and Dinka we have been able to make a contribution towards\u000a      improving child literacy in South Sudan, a major challenge for the\u000a      society. In 2009, we published a Shilluk translation of Handa's Hen\u000a      [5.MAN], a story set in East Africa, which attracted attention from The\u000a        Times [5.TIM] and was mentioned by the author of the original\u000a      version [5.HAN]. In 2012 we also published a collection of 30 Dinka\u000a      children's songs, known to children, which serve as a bootstrap to\u000a      beginning readers. Both are disseminated by local NGOs, and online through\u000a      MantraLingua [5.MAN]. The Dinka Language Development Association (DILDA)\u000a      has acknowledged the \"direct great contribution\" of these books [5.DIL].\u000a    Dinka songs: Whilst the Dinka lack a written tradition,\u000a      they have a vibrant song culture. Our research on the language enabled us\u000a      to transcribe and analyse songs, supervising the annotation of a large\u000a      number by native-speaker collaborators. The result is a collection\u000a      celebrating and documenting Dinka song tradition (collaboration with\u000a      Angela Impey, ethnomusicologist at SOAS). The collection is archived in\u000a      the DoBeS archive of the Max Planck Institute of Psycholinguistics and in\u000a      Edinburgh DataShare. It constitutes a permanent record of Dinka song\u000a      tradition. We additionally made a YouTube video, and, most importantly,\u000a      created a CD of Dinka songs which, with extensive coverage on BBC3's World\u000a      Routes programme, has introduced Dinka music to the world music scene for\u000a      the first time. Thus, in addition to benefits to the language community\u000a      (orthography; child literacy) we have impacted a much wider community of\u000a      interest [5.BBC]. The letter of thanks from DILDA also mentions the work\u000a      on Dinka songs, the underpinning research on tone, the orthography\u000a      development work and the children's book, acknowledging the benefits of\u000a      \"archiving ... songs\", and the contribution to \"cultural development\"\u000a      [5.DIL].\u000a    Advice: We share with other non-academic users the\u000a      expertise on Dinka and related languages that we have gained through our\u000a      research. In a legal arbitration on the status of Abyei at the\u000a      international tribunal in The Hague, the legal counsel of South Sudan\u000a      consulted Remijsen (6 February 2009 &amp; 9 March 2009) on the meaning of\u000a      place names in Abyei on old maps. \u000a    Capacity building: Through our research projects on these\u000a      languages, we have provided transferable skills in computer use, English,\u000a      Dinka, and Shilluk, to people in South Sudan: Dinka assistants trained and\u000a      employed on our project are now in South Sudan using these skills to wide\u000a      benefit in the community. We have developed and provided other training,\u000a      including teaching at the University of Khartoum and a week-long course on\u000a      Dinka grammar for DILDA in Juba. Evidence of the impact comes from\u000a      positive written feedback after a Dinka Cultural Day event where Remijsen\u000a      made a presentation to several hundred people about non-academic outputs\u000a      of the research. Staff and students attending the presentation commented\u000a      on Remijsen's \"wonderful\" and \"very interesting\" work on Dinka, and the\u000a      need for \"Dinka language to be [taught] in all [states of South Sudan]\"\u000a      [5.FED]. This enthusiastic response can be attested to by the director of\u000a      the British Council in South Sudan, who was also present [5.BRC]. The\u000a      Ministry of Education of Central Equatoria State also wrote in\u000a      appreciation of Remijsen's work on the Bari language, thanking him for\u000a      \"tireless help to the development of our Languages especially to train our\u000a      students of Secondary Schools and the University...\" [5.MOE].\u000a    Given the difficult economic environment of South Sudan, obtaining\u000a      corroborating evidence of impact from language users is a challenge;\u000a      further, the dysfunctional political situation sometimes makes it\u000a      difficult to obtain corroboration from official sources. We offer\u000a      additional sources of corroboration to supplement what is available from\u000a      the people directly impacted by this research.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    When an effective orthography and literacy materials are lacking for a\u000a      language, its speakers are disadvantaged in today's knowledge-based world,\u000a      because education and information cannot be delivered effectively. In\u000a      South Sudan, even the largest language communities are in this\u000a      predicament. Our research results on lexical and grammatical contrasts of\u000a      voice quality, vowel length and tone have enabled us to assist three\u000a      language communities (Dinka, Shilluk, and Bari) to develop literacy\u000a      resources.

We\u000a      carried out combined phonological and phonetic studies of form, to\u000a      evaluate earlier and newly-formed hypotheses. A production study\u000a      corroborated the hypothesis of three-level vowel length in Dinka (Remijsen\u000a      &amp; Gilley 2008). As a result, Dinka now constitutes a compelling case\u000a      for three-level vowel length in the world's languages. A detailed acoustic\u000a      study on Shilluk (Remijsen, Ayoker &amp; Mills 2011) revealed similarities\u000a      between voice quality and Advanced Tongue Root contrasts. Remijsen &amp;\u000a      Ladd (2009) presented a phonological analysis of a Dinka tone system.\u000a    As seen from the examples above, the suprasegmentals fulfill both lexical\u000a      and morphological functions. Because of this, descriptive analysis of the\u000a      morphosyntax of Dinka and Shilluk has played an important role in this\u000a      research programme. This has proved to be of interest in its own right.\u000a      For example, Ladd, Remijsen &amp; Manyang (2009) demonstrated that a\u000a      language can realise a morphosyntactic value with a much higher degree of\u000a      irregularity than previously assumed. We have expanded our investigations\u000a      into dialect variation in Dinka, and also into related languages (Thok\u000a      Reel and Bari).\u000a    This research programme is based on data collected through nine fieldwork\u000a      research trips to Khartoum (Sudan) and Juba (South Sudan), and four\u000a      3-month visits by Dinka and Shilluk native- speaker consultants to\u000a      Edinburgh.

The work done at Whithorn was\u000a      written up by Historic Scotland's Head of Cultural Heritage, who refers\u000a      explicitly to Forsyth's influence on the revisions to the display in his\u000a      paper `The Evolution of an Interpretative Approach', stating that `this\u000a      evolution [in the approach taken] has been significantly influenced by the\u000a      involvement of Dr Katherine Forsyth as consultant to the Historic Scotland\u000a      project team.'\u000a    Implementation of the new policy in specific sites\u000a    Historic Scotland used Forsyth's approach in the redevelopment of Iona\u000a      Museum in 2013 as well as St Vigeans Museum in 2009 and Whithorn Priory in\u000a      2005. Specific findings about individual monuments and about the\u000a      over-arching significance of each collection as a whole underpinned\u000a      Forsyth's interpretative plan for each site and formed the basis for the\u000a      redisplay strategy and design, including the ordering, grouping and\u000a      orientation of monuments, interpretative approach and themes, and content\u000a      for panels and labels, written guide-books and audio-guides and heritage\u000a      management databases.\u000a    Whithorn Priory redisplay\u000a    The sculptured stones at Whithorn Priory include the oldest Christian\u000a      monuments in Scotland, dating from the 5th to the 12th\u000a      centuries. Whithorn is known as the `cradle of Christianity' within\u000a      Scotland, a cultural, political and social centre in the early Christian\u000a      Era and for the next thousand years. The new displays create a more\u000a      accessible experience for visitors and locals, enhancing their\u000a      understanding of and connection with the people who carved the stones. As\u000a      one reviewer noted:\u000a    Early medieval sculpture is notoriously difficult to display with\u000a      complete success, as many museums can testify. For this reviewer the\u000a      sensitive handling of the material served to remind me of how significant\u000a      and regionally distinctive this assemblage of sculptures is. It is a more\u000a      successful approach for example than the similar lapidarium display at\u000a      Margam Abbey, South Wales (CADW) and hopefully bodes well for future\u000a      redisplays of Historic Scotland collections in Meigle, St Vigeans and\u000a      Iona. (`Exhibition Review: Whithorn's Medieval Material Culture on\u000a      Display', Scottish Archaeological Journal, 2005.)\u000a    Forsyth drafted the text for the information boards within the museum\u000a      following her work piecing together the damaged stones and reinterpreting\u000a      them and provided the new layout plan, as well as advising on locating and\u000a      lighting the stones. Between 2008 and 2012 more than 40,000 people had the\u000a      opportunity to view the new displays while visiting the Whithorn Priory\u000a      Museum. The revised display was runner-up in the Museum and Heritage\u000a      Awards for Excellence in 2008, beating entries from much more prominent\u000a      visitor sites throughout the UK.\u000a    Iona Abbey and Museum new display\u000a    Iona is one of the most popular tourist sites in Scotland, and has a\u000a      collection of stones which are unparalleled in Europe. The Museum reopened\u000a      in May 2013. Iona regularly receives 150,000 visitors per year, and the\u000a      Abbey is one of the key attractions. The museum's reinterpretation of the\u000a      history of Iona now reflects Forsyth's work on identifying the most\u000a      significant stones and most notably, her discovery that the layout of the\u000a      original stones was intended to mirror that of holy sites, including\u000a      Calvary and Christ's burial place in the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\u000a      The Head of Cultural Heritage for Historic Scotland says: `it has changed\u000a      the way we look at Iona. Its layout is far more significant than we\u000a      thought... the four key components of Christ's sacrifice on the cross are\u000a      here, because the monks wanted to contemplate the Passion of Christ in\u000a      their workshop.' Forsyth also assisted in piecing together and\u000a      reconstructing the major crosses, which are now on display. Historic\u000a      Scotland notes that her report:\u000a    was groundbreaking and innovative, rich in evidence-based interpretation,\u000a      which was precisely what we required to provide the firm foundation for\u000a      the now completed redisplay of the site museum. That work was completed in\u000a      summer 2012, but since then Kate has continued to play a key role as an\u000a      adviser to the project on an ad-hoc basis. Her work has had a direct and\u000a      positive impact on most aspects of the project `hardware', including the\u000a      new interpretation panels, audio guide, as well as the site museum. The\u000a      museum has attracted plaudits from our visitors, and will successfully\u000a      allow people to engage with the evidence of the distant past and thereby\u000a      take away a far better understanding.\u000a    \u000a   Figure 1.

In particular, she worked to create a new\u000a      record of all the early Christian stones in Munster, building an\u000a      impressive knowledge of early carvings and stonework. On the basis of this\u000a      expertise, in 2001 Historic Scotland invited Forsyth to undertake research\u000a      on some early medieval sculpture (5th-12th century)\u000a      in their care. This led to a total of three projects:\u000a    &#8212; work on a newly recognised ogham-inscribed cross-slab from Dyce,\u000a      Aberdeenshire (2001);\u000a    &#8212; the nationally significant collection of c.50 carved stones from\u000a      Whithorn, Galloway (2003-4); and,\u000a    &#8212; the research potential of 3D laser scanning and replication of early\u000a      medieval sculpture with case studies from Dunadd, Argyll and Dupplin\u000a      Cross, Perthshire (2010-11, in collaboration with the Centre for Digital\u000a      Documentation and Visualization, Glasgow School of Art). Two further\u000a      projects were assisted by Dr Adrian Maldonado, post-doctoral fellow in\u000a      Archaeology, School of Humanities: an internationally significant\u000a      collection of c.120 pieces of sculpture on Iona (2012- 13) and a\u000a      nationally significant collection of c.12 carved stones from Kirkmadrine,\u000a      Galloway (2013).\u000a    Her research drew on the disciplines of epigraphy, archaeology, art\u000a      history and history, involving extensive recording and analysis of\u000a      monuments in the field, and built on previous published work by the\u000a      authors (Forsyth 2001, 2008, 2012). The research focussed on the form,\u000a      function, date and significance of stone sculpture of early medieval date,\u000a      situating it in its landscape context and giving due consideration to the\u000a      complete biography of individual monuments, including their subsequent\u000a      history of reuse and modification. This allowed a complete reassessment of\u000a      the sculpture and its significance which revealed it to be, in each case,\u000a      a far richer and more complex body of material than previously thought.\u000a    Forsyth's work promotes the significance of interpreting the totality of\u000a      the collection at each site, including fragments and apparently lesser\u000a      material, and emphasises the importance of the biographical approach to\u000a      the ongoing use and abuse of sculptured stones. Stone sculpture is a key\u000a      body of evidence for understanding the history and culture of Britain and\u000a      Ireland in this period, not least because in many cases it is the only\u000a      early medieval evidence to survive from a site. Carved stones provide\u000a      insight into, for instance: the nature of post-Roman society and culture\u000a      in Britain, the date and context of Christianisation, the nature and\u000a      spread of monasticism, organisation of craft production, development of\u000a      religious iconography especially the cult of the Cross, relationships\u000a      between secular and ecclesiastical power, ethnic and linguistic change,\u000a      cultural and artistic\/intellectual relations between different regions of\u000a      Britain and between Britain and Ireland, and the monumentalisation of\u000a      burial.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24558","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research has significant and on-going impacts in furthering the\u000d\u000a      public and professional understanding of the historical and contemporary\u000d\u000a      French presence in London. A key objective of the research has been to\u000d\u000a      disseminate its insights and knowledge to interested groups, institutions\u000d\u000a      and the wider public.

The\u000d\u000a      strength of the research convinced the British Library of the need to\u000d\u000a      class the `London French' as a distinct community fulfilling the criteria\u000d\u000a      for inclusion in the UK Web Archive. As a result of these discussions, the\u000d\u000a      Library actively supported the creation of the `London French' digital\u000d\u000a      archive which is also a prime case study in how to use research to create\u000d\u000a      a community web archive that serves the needs of a variety of end-users.\u000d\u000a    The attitude of openness dates from the very start of the project with\u000d\u000a      its public launch event at the French Institute in London in July 2010. It\u000d\u000a      was attended by 70 representatives of the French Embassy and Consulate,\u000d\u000a      the French Chamber of Commerce, French professional associations in\u000d\u000a      London, the British and French media, London museums, galleries and\u000d\u000a      libraries, as well as interested members of the French community in\u000d\u000a      London.\u000d\u000a    The event led directly to a six-part programme series (2011) on French\u000d\u000a      Radio London on the contemporary French in London and press, TV and radio\u000d\u000a      interviews (notably with Le Monde, Ouest-France, Le\u000d\u000a        Journal de Dimanche, Ici Londres, Exapatlive, Le Petit\u000d\u000a        Journal, TV5, L'Echo). During the course of the project,\u000d\u000a      further press interest in its historical aspects has been evident in\u000d\u000a      solicited interviews and contributions to features for BBC London, France\u000d\u000a      24, Agence France Press, and La Croix, notably in 2010 (on the 70th\u000d\u000a      anniversary of de Gaulle's arrival in London during World War Two).

The London French Special\u000d\u000a      Collection in the UK Web Archive is a unique representation of a\u000d\u000a      particular resident community, itself part of the overall socio-cultural\u000d\u000a      make-up of 21st century Britain. The national digital archive\u000d\u000a      is designed to appeal to users across a spectrum of interest and\u000d\u000a      knowledge: the general reader, the teacher, the journalist, the policy\u000d\u000a      maker, the academic and personal researchers; see www.webarchive.org.uk\/ukwa\/info\/about\u000d\u000a      for general information about the UK Web Archive [password access is\u000d\u000a      available for the Special Collection].\u000d\u000a    The research underpinning the impact is interdisciplinary, originating in\u000d\u000a      the fields of cultural history and modern languages, and drawing on\u000d\u000a      migration studies, ethnography and social science methodologies,\u000d\u000a      particularly when focusing on the contemporary French population of\u000d\u000a      London. The research findings provide powerful insights into the\u000d\u000a      composition, motives, experiences and contributions of French migrants to\u000d\u000a      London between the seventeenth century and the present day. A series of\u000d\u000a      thematic areas are identified across the centuries: exile and refuge;\u000d\u000a      opportunity and entrepreneurship, politics and religion; leisure and\u000d\u000a      pleasure; the arts and business. The findings establish new historical and\u000d\u000a      contemporary evidence in several areas which underpin the research: the\u000d\u000a      traffic of social, political and cultural ideas between France and London;\u000d\u000a      the interchange of workers and its effects; the traffic of technological\u000d\u000a      knowledge and design ideas; ideas about French superiority in (for\u000d\u000a      example) fashion, gastronomy, luxury goods; French visitors to London and\u000d\u000a      London's image in France; and commercial, social, political and cultural\u000d\u000a      exchanges on a number of levels. The places frequented and settled by the\u000d\u000a      French, and the effects on those places across the centuries, are mapped\u000d\u000a      comprehensively for the first time. This facilitates the analysis of\u000d\u000a      patterns of the London French according to class, gender, generation,\u000d\u000a      place of origin, historical period, political and religious affiliation\u000d\u000a      and socio-economic status. The findings reveal the complex cultural and\u000d\u000a      socio-economic interactions between French citizens and the British\u000d\u000a      capital over several centuries. Connections are also made between the\u000d\u000a      lives of contemporary French residents and their predecessors thereby\u000d\u000a      giving an historical dimension to contemporary experience. In today's\u000d\u000a      London the research shows that the younger generation of French and\u000d\u000a      francophone residents represent ever-evolving facets of what it means for\u000d\u000a      them to live, work and `be French' in London. By analysing reciprocal\u000d\u000a      exchanges and transformations at the site of the encounter between French\u000d\u000a      and British cultures in a London that is itself constantly changing, the\u000d\u000a      research and its varied and wide-ranging impacts remain open to future\u000d\u000a      developments.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24571","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Researchers at Glasgow have supported the efforts of local partnerships\u000d\u000a      to bring significant\u000d\u000a      financial investment to their communities: &#163;1.7 million to the Lomonds\u000d\u000a      area; and, &#163;2.8 million to the\u000d\u000a      Isle of Bute.

These volumes collected\u000d\u000a      all the place-names of the\u000d\u000a      county of Fife along with their early forms, and subjected them to\u000d\u000a      linguistic and historical analysis,\u000d\u000a      and contextual discussion. In addition, the volumes presented short parish\u000d\u000a      histories and provided\u000d\u000a      access to many original documents. This work enabled UoG researchers to\u000d\u000a      gather momentum\u000d\u000a      towards an extensive survey of place-names. Recent progress includes the\u000d\u000a      publication of The\u000d\u000a        Place-Names of Bute (M&#225;rkus 2012), and the ongoing project `Scottish\u000d\u000a      Toponymy in Transition'\u000d\u000a      (STIT), which will produce three further volumes of survey (Kinross-shire,\u000d\u000a      Clackmannanshire and\u000d\u000a      vol.1 of Perthshire) by the time of its completion. This work has\u000d\u000a      transformed the professional\u000d\u000a      survey of place-names in Scotland. Prior to UoG's work, only one county\u000d\u000a      was surveyed and the\u000d\u000a      findings published to the required scholarly standard, and that had been\u000d\u000a      in the 1940s. In these\u000d\u000a      projects, researchers at UoG have created new standards for survey, as\u000d\u000a      well as conducting the\u000d\u000a      research and publishing the findings.\u000d\u000a    Scotland has one of the most complex linguistic histories of any country\u000d\u000a      in Europe, with five main\u000d\u000a      languages contributing to its long-term heritage. This makes place-names\u000d\u000a      key tools for historians\u000d\u000a      and linguists interested in Scotland's past. However, place-name research\u000d\u000a      in Scotland requires\u000d\u000a      very particular sets of linguistic and historical skills. Only by\u000d\u000a      carefully collecting as many early\u000d\u000a      forms of a place-name as possible can a valid linguistic analysis be made.\u000d\u000a      Such research also\u000d\u000a      requires a large degree of historical contextualisation, particularly\u000d\u000a      regarding secular and\u000d\u000a      ecclesiastical units such as baronies and parishes. The place-name survey\u000d\u000a      volumes are organised\u000d\u000a      by the pre-1975 civil parish, with each parish prefaced by an introduction\u000d\u000a      including key elements of\u000d\u000a      the parish history and important documents. These introductions have\u000d\u000a      proved very useful to local\u000d\u000a      history groups, acting as important sources for new locally-produced\u000d\u000a      parish histories, such as a\u000d\u000a      recently published one for Saline and one in preparation for Ballingry\u000d\u000a      (both west Fife).\u000d\u000a    The research itself has major ramifications for how people understand the\u000d\u000a      languages of Scotland\u000d\u000a      and their histories. For instance, the fine-grained study of Fife\u000d\u000a      place-names revealed that the\u000d\u000a      introduction of Scots was earlier around the burghs than in more landward\u000d\u000a      areas, and that the\u000d\u000a      names of lands held by reformed monastic houses had a tendency to be\u000d\u000a      replaced by Scots names.\u000d\u000a      This, along with other findings &#8212; eg the coining of names using the Gaelic\u000d\u000a      element baile\u000d\u000a      `farm(stead)' &#8212; allowed for the construction of a more nuanced time-frame\u000d\u000a      for the key period of\u000d\u000a      linguistic change in Fife (later 12th and early 13th centuries), and the\u000d\u000a      relationship of languages and\u000d\u000a      names. Importantly in a modern context, it confirms the central role that\u000d\u000a      Gaelic played in the\u000d\u000a      creation of place-names in Fife (the majority of settlement names are\u000d\u000a      derived from Gaelic),\u000d\u000a      allowing modern citizens of Fife to embrace their Gaelic inheritance, as\u000d\u000a      well as expand their\u000d\u000a      understanding of their Scots linguistic heritage.\u000d\u000a    In Bute, M&#225;rkus was able to untangle the relationships of Gaelic, Norse\u000d\u000a      and Scots on the island,\u000d\u000a      making a substantial and detailed contribution towards understanding\u000d\u000a      language and history, both\u000d\u000a      locally and nationally.\u000d\u000a    Work on the Fife and Bute surveys has shown the importance of local and\u000d\u000a      historical\u000d\u000a      contextualisation for place-names, which have in other countries often\u000d\u000a      been treated as primarily\u000d\u000a      linguistic items. It is this localisation which has allowed the place-name\u000d\u000a      research to play its part in a\u000d\u000a      variety of Heritage Landscape Partnerships, community initiatives, and\u000d\u000a      most recently in\u000d\u000a      educational developments.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Thomas Clancy, Lecturer (1995-2002), Reader (2002-5), Professor of\u000d\u000a        Celtic (2005-present).\u000d\u000a      Simon Taylor, Research Associate (2006-12), Researcher in Celtic &amp;\u000d\u000a        Gaelic and English\u000d\u000a        Language (2012-13), Lecturer in Celtic &amp; Gaelic and English Language\u000d\u000a        (2013-present).\u000d\u000a      Gilbert M&#225;rkus, Honorary Research Associate (2002-6), Research\u000d\u000a        Associate (2006-9),\u000d\u000a        Honorary Research Associate (2009-10), Research Associate (2010-13),\u000d\u000a        Lecturer in Celtic &amp;\u000d\u000a        Gaelic (2013-present).\u000d\u000a      Rachel Butter, PhD student (1999-2007), Honorary Research Associate\u000d\u000a        (2007-10), Research\u000d\u000a        Associate (2010-present).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    This research has allowed the Unit to develop the careers of a range of\u000d\u000a      researchers and has\u000d\u000a      enabled the Unit to develop innovative knowledge exchange strategies.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24573","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The CIN model\/process that was developed during the research project can\u000d\u000a      have significant impact in stimulating effective intercultural\u000d\u000a      communication because it questions the very assumptions that producers and\u000d\u000a      consumers from different cultures bring to what constitutes `information'.\u000d\u000a      These questions address the surface notions of neutrality and efficiency\u000d\u000a      that are normally anchored within a deeper, but ultimately\u000d\u000a      mono-dimensional code\/conduit metaphor of language\/ideology of\u000d\u000a      communication. Gallery `interpretation' and educational\/marketing\u000d\u000a      `information' are both re-orientated as part of the `cultural navigation'\u000d\u000a      process developed, which positions each communicative act within a\u000d\u000a      carefully articulated response to audience and context. This is\u000d\u000a      fundamental to the CIN model which is emphatically not about the\u000d\u000a      translation of texts, but precisely about the production and consumption\u000d\u000a      of information across cultures. The research that informs the CIN model\u000d\u000a      now cuts across aspects of translation studies, intercultural studies, and\u000d\u000a      applied language studies together with tourism studies (including tourism\u000d\u000a      and intercultural exchange), museum studies and cultural policy. Put\u000d\u000a      simply, no-one in the gallery and museum sector (and indeed beyond) thinks\u000d\u000a      about audiences in this way.\u000d\u000a    After hearing the findings of the pilot project and focus group research,\u000d\u000a      all of the marketing and communications directors of the institutions\u000d\u000a      involved in the first engagement meeting in November 2006 (Tate Britain,\u000d\u000a      National Gallery, V&amp;A, Westminster Abbey Museum, National Portrait\u000d\u000a      Gallery and British Museum) were receptive to the idea of improving the\u000d\u000a      quality of their information and of increasing their knowledge of how best\u000d\u000a      to support their international visitors with effective communication that\u000d\u000a      meets their cultural and linguistic expectations. Discussion also\u000d\u000a      generated other areas of improvement, such as reorganising information for\u000d\u000a      home visitors and developing the institutions' websites. At the request of\u000d\u000a      National Gallery's Director of Communications, Kelly also gave an invited\u000d\u000a      address to the ALVA Annual Conference, Blenheim Palace, June 2007 (this is\u000d\u000a      the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions whose members represent\u000d\u000a      visitor attractions with over 1 million visitors a year, from Blackpool\u000d\u000a      Pleasure Beach to UK historic houses and stately homes).\u000d\u000a    The purpose of the AHRC-funded workshops (July-December 2007) was\u000d\u000a      primarily to redesign partner museums'\/galleries' information leaflets.\u000d\u000a      The research moved the issue of material targeted at the international\u000d\u000a      audience up the partner institutions' priority list. Each institution\u000d\u000a      (Tate Britain, British Museum, V&amp;A, National Portrait Gallery,\u000d\u000a      National Gallery and Museum of London) worked with a member of the Project\u000d\u000a      Team to produce a culturally-informed, `high-value' leaflet in one\u000d\u000a      language: (from a choice of Arabic; Spanish; French; German; Chinese;\u000d\u000a      Russian). The test material produced in the course of the workshops was\u000d\u000a      also much more positively received by international visitors on whom it\u000d\u000a      was trialled than was the original museum-produced material used in the\u000d\u000a      initial focus groups; if the information provided is targeted and\u000d\u000a      culturally-aware, visitors feel more comfortable, enjoy themselves more\u000d\u000a      and the overall experience is more positive. The National Gallery in\u000d\u000a      particular made changes to its strategy on the provision of information\u000d\u000a      for its international visitors as a result of the project noting that:\u000d\u000a      \"despite the fact that preliminary research [by the pilot study] showed\u000d\u000a      that the quality of its general information guides for international\u000d\u000a      visitors already exceeds that of other leading UK museums and galleries,\u000d\u000a      further research revealed a range of areas for radical improvement\".\u000d\u000a      Following participation in the workshop series, the National Gallery\u000d\u000a      identified \"provision of high-quality, culturally-informed and\u000d\u000a      audience-targeted information as a priority area for development in the\u000d\u000a      current climate of an increasingly competitive global cultural tourism\u000d\u000a      market\" (quote from a further 2008 funding application). The National\u000d\u000a      Gallery also noted that, for its international audiences, the research\u000d\u000a      allowed it to plan more culturally-specific resources &#8212; including\u000d\u000a      guidebooks, audio guides, printed material and online information &#8212; of\u000d\u000a      varying breadth and depth for first-time visitors and for more deeply\u000d\u000a      engaged users. It enabled the Gallery to think about helping people\u000d\u000a      prepare for their visits more effectively, to engage with the collection\u000d\u000a      more during their visit and to continue their engagement after the visit.\u000d\u000a      The Gallery further highlighted that the project was of benefit not only\u000d\u000a      to international audiences, but also to the student community, to those in\u000d\u000a      UK and globally who study culture in an international context, and to\u000d\u000a      domestic multicultural audiences.\u000d\u000a    At the final workshop (December 2007), a wider range of marketing and\u000d\u000a      communications professionals from across the UK visitor sector were\u000d\u000a      invited to share the research findings and to comment on them.

Following these pilots, a project partner\u000d\u000a      engagement meeting was held at Westminster on 1st November 2006\u000d\u000a      as part of the preparation of a funding bid. The series of AHRC-funded\u000d\u000a      research workshops entitled `Museums and Galleries and the International\u000d\u000a      Visitor Experience (MGIVE)' was carried out at Westminster from July to\u000d\u000a      December 2007 (workshops held on July 2nd; October 22nd,\u000d\u000a      December 3rd) with representatives from the sector, firstly in\u000d\u000a      London and then across the UK.

As\u000d\u000a      a result it showed little or no awareness of the needs, expectations and\u000d\u000a      sensitivities of visitors from other cultural areas. It also revealed\u000d\u000a      preconceptions concerning communication and culture &#8212; often negative in\u000d\u000a      subtle ways &#8212; leading to lower outcomes in terms of cultural\u000d\u000a      mission\/economic sustainability. The problem was compounded by the fact\u000d\u000a      that some museums and galleries believed they had developed a `global\u000d\u000a      brand' which obviates the need for different types of information for\u000d\u000a      international visitors. In reality this was often inadequate and did not\u000d\u000a      meet international visitor needs and expectations.\u000d\u000a    The research led to a new way of approaching the creation of\u000d\u000a      high-quality, culturally-informed, audience-targeted information for\u000d\u000a      international visitors which the project team entitled: `Communication for\u000d\u000a      Intercultural Navigation' (CIN). This is an original model developed by\u000d\u000a      the project team to inform the process for the production of high-value\u000d\u000a      information for international visitors for use by linguistic\/intercultural\u000d\u000a      specialists in discussion with the needs of a particular museum or\u000d\u000a      gallery. The model interrogates not only how to communicate most\u000d\u000a      effectively with international visitors, but more generally how to package\u000d\u000a      information meaningfully in the museum\/gallery context. The research model\u000d\u000a      is grounded in theories of intercultural communication and translation\u000d\u000a      studies, and also partially based on semiotic analysis (including the\u000d\u000a      notion of the `semiosphere'). However, it extends beyond texts and\u000d\u000a      translations to issues concerning social interaction and ethnographic\u000d\u000a      encounters, incorporating methodologies from sociolinguistics to inform\u000d\u000a      not only the analysis of texts and their semiotic value, but also,\u000d\u000a      crucially, their production by one culture for consumption by another.\u000d\u000a    A key aim of the research and workshops was to move from strategy to\u000d\u000a      execution. As a result, during the workshops, researchers and academics\u000d\u000a      worked together to draft new material in a range of languages, which were\u000d\u000a      then tested in-house. At the final workshop, a wider range of marketing\u000d\u000a      and communications professionals from across the UK visitor sector were\u000d\u000a      invited to share the research findings and to comment on them.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"25828","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Beneficiaries of the research are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Decision-makers and stakeholders in communication support in the legal\u000d\u000a        sector(e.g. senior members of Judiciary)\u000d\u000a      Police trainers (e.g. Scottish Police College staff)\u000d\u000a      Police Institutional users of interpreting at national and\u000d\u000a        international levels (e.g. Police Forces)\u000d\u000a      Organisations providing communication support (e.g. Happy to\u000d\u000a          Translate)\u000d\u000a      Knowledge exchange bodies in Policing (e.g. Scottish Institute for\u000d\u000a        Policing Research, SIPR)\u000d\u000a      Professional bodies for legal interpreters (e.g. EULITA)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Police investigative communications involving interpreters have been\u000d\u000a      enhanced through the work of CTISS.

Arising from an EU funded\u000d\u000a      project with CTISS (Perez and Wilson) as one of three academic partners,\u000d\u000a      EULITA (European Legal Interpreters and Translators Association) was\u000d\u000a      launched in November 2009. An association of legal interpreters and\u000d\u000a      translators EULITA also holds the EU-wide register of qualified legal\u000d\u000a      interpreters and translators and promotes co-operation between\u000d\u000a      practitioners and researchers (see Source 6). The EULITA website is now\u000d\u000a      the prime EU repository for all information on legal interpreting and\u000d\u000a      translation. EULITA has gone on to lead projects such as TRAFUT on the\u000d\u000a      training of legal interpreters and translators. This project also\u000d\u000a      addressed a number of impediments to the transposition of EU Directive\u000d\u000a      2010. Source 3 notes that following participation in the TRAFUT project,\u000d\u000a      further progress in Scotland will be supported by facilitating the \"observing\u000d\u000a        of interpreter-mediated trials with a view to assessing, and hopefully\u000d\u000a        remedying quality issues to ensure compliance with the European\u000d\u000a        Directive and equal access to justice\". In recognition of her work\u000d\u000a      with EULITA Wilson was invited to join a team of experts that developed\u000d\u000a      the national professional standards which underpin the development of\u000d\u000a      vocational qualifications in interpreting.\u000d\u000a    Recently, appropriate procurement procedures have been identified as a\u000d\u000a      crucial element in the down-stream assurance of quality in police\u000d\u000a      interpreting provision.

The recommendations of\u000d\u000a      the report to the Scottish Minister for Communities and Social Justice\u000d\u000a      informed policy regarding future TICS provision and associated training\u000d\u000a      requirements.

The ImPLI report (B&#246;ser, Wilson et al, 2012, http:\/\/www.isit-paris.fr\/documents\/ImPLI\/Final_Report.pdf)\u000d\u000a      surveys police interpreting practices in six jurisdictions. It provides\u000d\u000a      the first overview of its kind on associated issues and provides a set of\u000d\u000a      related recommendations.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Conceptualising the role of the interpreter in face-to-face\u000d\u000a          investigative communication to support best practice.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Police interviews are the central interactional resource in the\u000d\u000a      investigative process. Little research has been carried out on the role of\u000d\u000a      interpreters in such interactions. Research in CTISS has built on Mason's\u000d\u000a      pioneering conceptualisation of the interpreter's role (2000, 2001, 2006,\u000d\u000a      2009). Applying critical discourse analysis and pragmatics to\u000d\u000a      socially-situated, mediated face-to-face interaction this research\u000d\u000a      identifies a clash between users' perceptions of interpreters as mere\u000d\u000a      \"conduits\" and the active role which interpreters play in the construction\u000d\u000a      of mediated discourse. This process involves complex triadic negotiations\u000d\u000a      of meaning and of the boundaries of the interpreter's role in a context of\u000d\u000a      frequently conflicting expectations by institutional and non-institutional\u000d\u000a      users. CTISS researchers have drawn on this work in their exploration of\u000d\u000a      face-to-face interpreting in the context of the pre-trial stage of legal\u000d\u000a      proceedings. B&#246;ser (2013) shows the impact which specific modes of\u000d\u000a      interpreting have on the realisation of the institutional goals which\u000d\u000a      shape forensic formats of police interviews.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Research based interventions in the advancement of\u000d\u000a          professionalization of Public Service Interpreting (PSI).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The TICS report (2006) highlights the preponderance of conditions (e.g.\u000d\u000a      use of unqualified interpreters) and processes (e.g. modalities of\u000d\u000a      procurement) which jeopardise the provision of a high quality service. The\u000d\u000a      ImPLI report (2012) corroborates and develops these findings at European\u000d\u000a      level. Ricoy (2010) provides an analysis of the interrelationship of\u000d\u000a      elements and constraints in the professionalization of PSI. This\u000d\u000a      interconnectedness of factors informs the interlinked approach to training\u000d\u000a      for all participants in interpreter mediated police settings outlined by\u000d\u000a      Perez and Wilson (2011).\u000d\u000a    Research was carried out with external funding from a variety of sources:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the Scottish Executive for the TICS report (&#163;50,000)\u000d\u000a      DG Criminal Justice for EULITA I and II, ImPLI, TRAFUT,\u000d\u000a        Co-Minor-IN\/QUEST (share of grants, CTISS: &#8364;153,949)\u000d\u000a      AHRC for Negotiating the Ethical Maze in Interpreter-mediated\u000d\u000a          Investigative Interviews (&#163;37,671)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Key researchers: Ursula B&#246;ser, Ian Mason (left in 2010),\u000d\u000a      Isabel Perez, Christine Wilson.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"25829","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2629691","Name":"Iceland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Heriot-Watt's output propels the access agenda for Deaf people in\u000d\u000a      Scotland and beyond.

Heriot-Watt has been the only university represented on\u000d\u000a      BSLLAWG throughout this period, and has \"brought new information to the\u000d\u000a        table and applied research findings informatively to topics across the\u000d\u000a        policy spectrum\" (Source 1). BSLLAWG channels priorities to\u000d\u000a      Government and acts as the policy `think-tank' for improving linguistic\u000d\u000a      access nationally. In August 2009, leveraging contributions from\u000d\u000a      Heriot-Watt research, the Working Group published a BSL `roadmap', setting\u000d\u000a      out the knowledge SG, Local Authorities and public bodies require when\u000d\u000a      setting and implementing policy: \"Insights from Heriot-Watt research\u000d\u000a        influenced the recommendations of the report in all areas of BSL\"\u000d\u000a      (Source 1).

(This had been\u000d\u000a      recognised as critical since 2002, when BSLLAWG produced a blueprint for\u000d\u000a      BSL http:\/\/www.ssc.education.ed.ac.uk\/resources\/deaf\/sasli\/intro.html,\u000d\u000a      underlining that vital expansion of skills was impossible without more BSL\u000d\u000a      teachers and thus teacher-training.)

UK-wide, key\u000d\u000a      institutions have exploited our research similarly: the British Deaf\u000d\u000a      Association notes that our work enables them \"to undergird our\u000d\u000a      campaigning with a strong, evidence-based account of `heritage BSL'. Our\u000d\u000a      campaigns are, above all, designed to carry forward language planning\u000d\u000a      strategies that are significantly informed by Heriot-Watt University's\u000d\u000a      research and policy analysis. We have been assisted in drafting\u000d\u000a      consultation responses and position statements with reference to your\u000d\u000a      work and it is clear that your engagement has advanced public awareness\u000d\u000a      and debate on BSL\" (Source 7).

Informing a 2013 Liberal Democrat conference vote for enhanced\u000d\u000a      BSL recognition, we briefed Westminster MPs on BSL policy challenges\u000d\u000a      (Stephen Lloyd, Mike Crockart http:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/edm\/2010-12\/2549).\u000a      This included digital, remote interpreting services, a commercial field\u000d\u000a      transforming SLTI services (worth a proportionate share of $33 billion\u000d\u000a      globally &#8212; Common Sense Advisory 2012). Market leader SignVideo http:\/\/www.signvideo.co.uk\/\u000d\u000a      consulted us on service delivery. Citing our BSL corpus study (grant i,\u000d\u000a      section 3), they note that this research \"legitimises the status of BSL\u000d\u000a        and by establishing this gives weight to the daily communication\u000d\u000a        barriers faced by deaf BSL users which proves the business case for an\u000d\u000a        instant-access communication solution such as SignVideo.

Impact on governmental policies relating to language\u000a    Crystal's research has led to far reaching and significant impacts on\u000a      governmental policies relating to language usage, planning and\u000a      maintenance, at both national and international level [3.1, 3.2].\u000a    During the REF census period, for instance, Crystal's research has\u000a      impacted on the way UK governmental ministries deploy language in\u000a      communicating with the general public &#8212; part of the so-called \"plain\u000a      English campaign\" conducted under the UK Government's Public\u000a      Administration Select Committee. A public consultation document on the\u000a      state of Local Government Improvement and Development 2001-2010 entitled \"The\u000a        state of the language\" [5.1] was circulated by the Select\u000a      Committee. This document relied, in large part, on Crystal's research on\u000a      language usage, especially his findings relating to official language. He\u000a      was subsequently invited, as one of four experts, and the only linguist,\u000a      to appear before the Select Committee at the House of Commons (9th\u000a      July 2009) [5.2]. He provided advice on the issue of official\u000a      language use, and ways to improve linguistic and communication strategies,\u000a      by government, local and national, in official communications with the\u000a      general public. The ensuing report \"Bad Language: The Use and Abuse of\u000a        Official Language\" (30 Nov. 2009), [5.3] urges \"politicians\u000a      and public servants to use language that is clear, honest and\u000a      understandable\" and relies heavily on Crystal's expertise: Crystal is the\u000a      only one of the expert witnesses consulted cited in the report (56\u000a      citations). The ensuing impact on language usage was felt UK-wide\u000a      throughout the civil service, which was invited to adopt the report's\u000a      recommendation.\u000a    2. Impact on public awareness and greater understanding of the role\u000a        and value of linguistic diversity in culture and society\u000a    Secondly, Crystal's research has significantly enhanced public awareness\u000a      and understanding of the nature and value of linguistic change and\u000a      diversity. This impact is evidenced by Crystal's dissemination of his\u000a      research findings and engagement with the general public. Since 2008,\u000a      Crystal has published seven books translating his research for a general\u000a      audience, with a common theme of the role and value of linguistic\u000a      diversity. Several of these have been translated, such as Txting: the\u000a        gr8 db8 (2008, Oxford: OUP), which appeared in Chinese since (2010).\u000a      He has made over 100 invited TV\/radio appearances to comment and\/or report\u000a      on specific issues relating to language diversity, as well as many invited\u000a      podcasts. These include a BBC Newsnight feature with Jeremy Paxman\u000a      (first aired Nov 2008); an appearance on BBC4's It's only a theory\u000a      (first aired Oct 2009); and recordings for the British Library. Some of\u000a      his broadcasts, have subsequently been deposited on YouTube, attracting\u000a      even greater exposure [5.4]. According to YouTube's statistics on\u000a      typical viewers (by age and gender), the viewers across these YouTube\u000a      postings are predominantly (35-54 year old) men, and (45-54 year old)\u000a      women: distinctly above the usual age for university students. Viewing\u000a      figures (&gt;100,000K [5.4]) reveal that viewings have steadily\u000a      increased over time and that almost every country that has internet access\u000a      has viewed his presentations, with some of the postings having the highest\u000a      proportion of hits in Australia, Spain and parts of South America,\u000a      demonstrating worldwide reach of his work. Further public engagement can\u000a      be found in news coverage, such as, for example, in the Guardian, BBC and\u000a      internationally in the Economist, Huffington Post and on Minnesota Public\u000a      Radio. Crystal's public engagement extends to popular media, such as his\u000a      play Living On (1998) on the plight of minority languages, which\u000a      has been staged by various amateur dramatic companies worldwide, and as\u000a      far afield as Yerevan State University in Armenia (2012) [5.5].\u000a    From Nov 2010 to April 2011, Crystal co-curated a major exhibition at the\u000a      British Library in London. Evolving English: one language, many voices,\u000a      was the first time the Library had presented an exhibition on the English\u000a      language and the planning and selection of content relied heavily on\u000a      Crystal's research. He provided the audio examples of earlier periods of\u000a      English used in the exhibition and wrote the accompanying book with the\u000a      same name (London: British Library, 2010). It proved to be the\u000a      best-attended winter exhibition the Library had ever put on. Over 10,000\u000a      visitors that attended the exhibition contributed a recording of their\u000a      spoken English to the British Library's Sound Archive, which can still be\u000a      enjoyed online [5.6].\u000a    3. Global commercial impact in internet advertising applications\u000a    In 2001, together with David Saunders, Crystal set up his company Crystal\u000a      Semantics, with the aim of developing lexical products, including the\u000a      Global Data Model. Uniquely using context, human linguistic intuition and\u000a      semantic relationships between words, this led ultimately to the\u000a      development of the patented Sense Engine&#8482;, which provides the basis of a\u000a      suite of targeted online technology solutions that currently lead the\u000a      field in web-based advertising to make advertisements relevant to the\u000a      subject of each individual webpage.\u000a    In 2006, Crystal sold Crystal Semantics to Ad Pepper Media International\u000a      &#8212; one of the world's largest online advertising technology solutions\u000a      providers, with a reach of over 4 billion monthly impressions of web and\u000a      email. Ad Pepper incorporated the Sense Engine as a reference frame into\u000a      two new web advertising technologies: The iSense system (launched\u000a      September 2007 in Europe, March 2008 in North America) provided the online\u000a      advertising community with the world's first targeted advertising system,\u000a      allowing adverts to load on the most contextually appropriate webpages,\u000a      and in the most appropriate locations, maximising the potential success of\u000a      the advert. The precise advert placement facilitated by iSense has\u000a      transformed the digital advertising industry. It is currently is available\u000a      in 11 languages, has won numerous awards and is applied by the world's\u000a      leading brands including Volkswagen, IBM and Philips (more brand\u000a      references listed on Ad Pepper's website [5.7]). In 2009, Ad\u000a      Pepper launched the SiteScreen system [5.8, 5.9] that also\u000a      incorporates Crystal's Sense Engine, protecting advertisers by identifying\u000a      potentially objectionable content in various categories and thereby making\u000a      and end to ads loading next to such content.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor David Crystal's world-leading research on language policy,\u000a      diversity and usage, conducted at Bangor since 2000, has led to a\u000a      transformation in terms of public and political attitudes, both nationally\u000a      and internationally, towards the nature and use of language in public and\u000a      private discourse.

The first concerned the nature of language usage, the dangers\u000a      of prescriptivism, and the nature and development of the English language;\u000a      exemplars include The Stories of English, [3.1] and The\u000a        Fight for English [3.2]. The second area relates the\u000a      cultural value and significance attached to linguistic diversity, and the\u000a      negative impact on a culture when a language dies out, represented by his\u000a      book Language Death [3.3]. A further aspect of Crystal's\u000a      research on linguistic diversity focused on new media, as exemplified by Language\u000a        and the Internet [3.4], also submitted in RAE2008. The third\u000a      area concerns Crystal's development of a semantic content classification\u000a      schema for improving online search, leading a team of over 40\u000a      lexicographers, between 1998 and 2004, to assign lexical senses to\u000a      knowledge categories [3.5, 3.6]. The resulting Global Data Model\u000a      was patented in the UK in July 2003 (patent no. GB2345771), and in the USA\u000a      in December 2007 (patent no. 7305415 B2).\u000a    Specific findings\u000a    Crystal's research has given rise to four sets of specific findings that\u000a      have resulted in significant impact during the current REF census period:\u000a    \u000a      Language usage in communicative contexts, such as in official language\u000a        domains: explicit guidelines on best practice in terms of communicative\u000a        factors such as the message being conveyed, selection of lexis and\u000a        grammatical structures, and avoidance of ambiguities [3.1, 3.4].\u000a      Language diversity: demonstrating its benefits to communities,\u000a        cultural life and heritage, adding value to the wider economy, and\u000a        advocating policies of language maintenance [3.1-3.4].\u000a      The English language: a focus on significant variation arising from\u000a        historical contexts and socio-political factors, drawing attention to\u000a        the dangers of linguistic prescriptivism and an exclusive focus on a\u000a        single variety of 'standard' English; there is particular emphasis on a\u000a        global perspective, and to the role of new media in enhancing rather\u000a        than adversely affecting language [3.1-3.4].\u000a      Semantic taxonomy [3.5, 3.6]: the development of a lexical\u000a        semantic frame of reference (or 'sense engine') within which an online\u000a        classification engine can operate. The aim is to ensure that a web page\u000a        is accurately classified, so that its content can be accessed with\u000a        confidence by anyone using the internet, thus improving relevance and\u000a        accuracy in search, appropriateness in advertising placement, and\u000a        protection against insensitive or objectionable subject-matter.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"26215","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The work described in Section 2 has had a significant impact on the\u000d\u000a      resurgence and rejuvenation of the Welsh language since 2008, with\u000d\u000a      specific benefits to poetry, education, community projects and publishing\u000d\u000a      businesses, and has contributed extensively to contemporary debate and\u000d\u000a      current perspectives on the Welsh language. The significance of the impact\u000d\u000a      is in disproportion to the size of this group of researchers and ranges\u000d\u000a      from involvement with national organisations to regional events, from\u000d\u000a      community-based projects to curriculum design, utilising and promoting the\u000d\u000a      Welsh language as a vibrant, living medium throughout.\u000d\u000a    Impact on national and regional poetry celebration and presentation\u000d\u000a          of cultural heritage\u000d\u000a    Between July 2006 and April 2008 Thomas was appointed by The\u000d\u000a      Welsh Academy of Writers (later Literature Wales) as second National Poet\u000d\u000a      of Wales, in recognition of the contribution to Welsh language\u000d\u000a      rejuvenation of his celebrated selected volume of poems, Gweddnewidio.\u000d\u000a      In this capacity, Thomas took a proactive approach to extending\u000d\u000a      the reach of contemporary Welsh poetry and in doing so, interpreting the\u000d\u000a      still-novel role of National Poet. He adopted from the outset a variety of\u000d\u000a      strategies ranging from responding in verse to `news stories' (e.g. the\u000d\u000a      passing of Welsh rugby giant Ray Gravell and the achievements of the often\u000d\u000a      controversial and unconventional North Wales police chief, Richard\u000d\u000a      Brunstrom) to placing unfamiliar poems on beer mats (5.1). Another\u000d\u000a      strategy was the regular translation of his poems into English. Through\u000d\u000a      his poems and wide outreach he raised the profile of Welsh poetry and\u000d\u000a      extended its reach to new audiences throughout Wales and beyond, an impact\u000d\u000a      which extended well beyond the period of his official appointment (5.1).\u000d\u000a    In recognition of his importance for Welsh national identity and his\u000d\u000a      expertise in propagation of the language, Thomas was commissioned\u000d\u000a      in 2009 to write a verse that was inscribed within the structure of the\u000d\u000a      new Snowdon visitor centre, Hafod Eryri. Visited annually by around\u000d\u000a      500,000 visitors from around the world, permanent, worldwide reach of his\u000d\u000a      work and the Welsh language has thereby been secured on this\u000d\u000a      world-renowned summit (5.2). In addition, and in recognition of their\u000d\u000a      significance as writers steeped in the history and heritage of their\u000d\u000a      community, Thomas, Hunter, Price and Wiliams were all\u000d\u000a      commissioned in 2011 to write pieces celebrating the high-profile 60th\u000d\u000a      anniversary of the Snowdonia National Park which annually attracts over 4\u000d\u000a      million visitors (5.3). Their participation in this web-based project\u000d\u000a      demonstrates how these writers utilise a variety of social platforms to\u000d\u000a      ensure extended impact of their work, and in the same year, Hunter\u000d\u000a      and Price were among a select group of 26 authors invited to take\u000d\u000a      part in the National Library of Wales's 26 Treasures celebratory project,\u000d\u000a      part of a wider collaboration with the National Museum of Scotland and the\u000d\u000a      Ulster Museum. The book accompanying the exhibition, including the work by\u000d\u000a      Hunter and Price, has sold between 1000 and 1500 copies to\u000d\u000a      date.\u000d\u000a    Two national bodies that these writers have regularly impacted upon are\u000d\u000a      the National Eisteddfod of Wales, which attracts around 150,000 visitors a\u000d\u000a      year, and the Urdd National Eisteddfod, which draws in the region of\u000d\u000a      100,000 visitors annually (5.4). Hunter won the prestigious Prose\u000d\u000a      Medal in the 2010 National Eisteddfod with his Gwenddydd and the\u000d\u000a      ensuing publicity has ensured a still wider reach. For the 2012 Urdd\u000d\u000a      National Eisteddfod, 'Dan Ein Trwynau' from Tafarn Tawelwch by Wiliams\u000d\u000a      was selected for a 19-25 age-group recitation competition, which in\u000d\u000a      practical terms meant that the poem was learnt by hundreds of youngsters\u000d\u000a      and publically performed in tens of local and area eisteddfodau before\u000d\u000a      reaching the national stage and enjoying simultaneous multiplatform media\u000d\u000a      coverage, including a 47,000 television audience (5.7).\u000d\u000a    These writers have also been involved in a variety of bespoke projects\u000d\u000a      which have extended the reach of contemporary Welsh writing by exposing it\u000d\u000a      to bold new contexts. For example, Davies was commissioned in May\u000d\u000a      2012 to write a poem responding to the coal-inspired exhibition of artist\u000d\u000a      Jonathan Anderson at Oriel Myrddin, Carmarthen. This invitation was a\u000d\u000a      direct result of Davies's depiction of industrial south Wales in\u000d\u000a      `Egni' in 2004. Another impact directly-associated with research, this\u000d\u000a      time on a regional level, occurred during the 2010 Caernarfon-based\u000d\u000a      literary festival, G&#373;yl Arall. Price's Caersaint was\u000d\u000a      central to the author-led walking tour of Caernarfon; a multi-platform\u000d\u000a      game based on the novel, along with a blog, was commissioned and formed a\u000d\u000a      prominent part of the festival's activities, as reported in the regional\u000d\u000a      and national press (5.5, 5.6).\u000d\u000a    Impacts on Welsh language education and literature engagement\u000d\u000a    The impact of these writers ranges from the educational to the\u000d\u000a      recreational. Wiliams's `Efrog Newydd Eto' from Rhwng\u000d\u000a        Gwibdaith a Coldplay was included as a learning aid in Gareth King's\u000d\u000a      popular The Routledge Intermediate Welsh Reader (2013); the text\u000d\u000a      was included as an example of contemporary poetry and used to extend\u000d\u000a      Welsh-learners' linguistic skills. It was described by King as `a telling\u000d\u000a      demonstration of the capacity of this ancient linguistic tradition to find\u000d\u000a      its voice in the wider modern world' (5.8). Price's Caersaint\u000d\u000a      and Hunter's Gwenddydd have been used as set texts, the\u000d\u000a      first for a course in the School of Welsh at Cardiff University and the\u000d\u000a      latter as a set text in Aberystwyth University's Department of Welsh,\u000d\u000a      while Davies's `Egni' has been a set text at both Cardiff and\u000d\u000a      Aberystwyth (5.9). Hunter's Gwenddydd, Price's Caersaint\u000d\u000a      and Wiliams's Rhwng Gwibdaith a Coldplay have been the\u000d\u000a      chosen subject for reading clubs throughout Wales; Caersaint was\u000d\u000a      also chosen by the Welsh Books Council as its Novel of the Month in March\u000d\u000a      2010 and Hunter's Gwreiddyn Chwerw in July 2011, providing\u000d\u000a      evidence for the significant impact of these works on literature\u000d\u000a      engagement in communities throughout Wales (5.4).\u000d\u000a    Impact on media and Small and Medium Enterprises\u000d\u000a    This practice-led research has regularly steered contemporary debate and\u000d\u000a      influenced current perspectives on the Welsh language. The research cited\u000d\u000a      in Section 2 has provided ample subject-matter for numerous television and\u000d\u000a      radio programmes such as S4C's flagship art platform Pethe which\u000d\u000a      regularly draws audiences of between 20,000-50,000 viewers (e.g. March\u000d\u000a      2010, September 2011, June 2012) (5.10) and BBC Radio Cymru's Stiwdio\u000d\u000a      (e.g. July 2012) as well as extensive web presence. Hunter's\u000d\u000a      success with Gwenddydd was the deciding element in having the\u000d\u000a      author selected as the guest for an episode of Dweud Pethe on S4C,\u000d\u000a      an in-depth interview with host Guto Harri. In addition to providing\u000d\u000a      material and setting the agenda for media programmes, works created by\u000d\u000a      this group of writers have provided publishing opportunities leading to\u000d\u000a      economic benefits to various SMEs (5.4), namely Gwasg y Bwthyn, Gwasg\u000d\u000a      Gwynedd and Y Lolfa, which are all located in rural Wales within the\u000d\u000a      Convergence Area designated for Structural Funds from the European Union\u000d\u000a      between 2007-2013. For instance, Hunter's Gwenddydd has\u000d\u000a      sold over 2400 copies and Price's Caersaint over 2000. The\u000d\u000a      fact that these sales continue to grow indicates the lasting public\u000d\u000a      interest in these important works.\u000d\u000a    Extending the reach of Welsh literature through translation\u000d\u000a    An additional important feature of this group's impact is translation\u000d\u000a      (see also REF5, section b), which extends the bounds of contemporary Welsh\u000d\u000a      literature and creates cultural capital far beyond Wales. For example, Price's\u000a      The Life of Rebecca Jones (Gwasg Gomer, 2010, and The MacLehose\u000d\u000a      Press, 2012), a translation of her 2001 O! Tyn y Gorchudd\u000d\u000a      (submitted to RAE 2008), is also available on Kindle. It was praised in The\u000a        Independent &#8212; `Widely hailed as the first Welsh classic of the 21st\u000d\u000a      century, it now stands tall ... as a peak of modern British writing too'\u000d\u000a      (5.11) &#8212; and was chosen as one of the novels of the year by The Irish\u000d\u000a        Times and The Independent. Price has also been\u000d\u000a      invited to discuss the work in venues such as the 2012 Hay Literary\u000d\u000a      Festival and Nottingham Welsh Society.\u000d\u000a    Lloyd Jones's translation of the novel derives from an extended process\u000d\u000a      of creative interaction with the author. In order to translate the novel\u000d\u000a      into six further languages, including German, Romanian and Bengali,\u000d\u000a      similar creative interactions between author and translator have been\u000d\u000a      facilitated by the Wales Literature Exchange, an organization which aims\u000d\u000a      to connect writers, translators and publishers in Wales and abroad (5.12).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Inspired by the pioneering work of Gwyn Thomas since the\u000d\u000a      mid-1960s, writers based in Bangor University's School of Welsh are\u000d\u000a      actively engaged in practice-led research.

This context has permeated his verse and led to a research\u000d\u000a      focus on how a minority language, steeped in tradition, can take up its\u000d\u000a      place within modern society and face up to current global affairs. Since\u000d\u000a      1993 specifically, the motivation driving this creative challenge has been\u000d\u000a      to ensure relevance for his writing, and poetry in particular, within the\u000d\u000a      present world. His work has been extremely influential in challenging\u000d\u000a      fellow writers to connect linguistically, intellectually and emotionally\u000d\u000a      and impacts upon current debate and modern sensibility. Published in 1998,\u000d\u000a      Darllen y Meini (3i) reaffirmed that a quest for accountability has\u000d\u000a      been a constant feature of Thomas's poetics. In July 2000, Thomas\u000d\u000a      published Gweddnewidio (3ii), a retrospective selection of his\u000d\u000a      earlier poems. This selection confirms his essential contribution to\u000d\u000a      contemporary Welsh poetry and his pre-eminent status. His importance in\u000d\u000a      extending the thematic reach of Welsh poetry is suggested by leading poet\u000d\u000a      and critic Alan Llwyd: in his extended review of Gweddnewidio, he\u000d\u000a      states that `everything [as exemplified by the poems of Thomas] is\u000d\u000a      subject-matter for poetry in our modern world, from the songs of Elvis and\u000d\u000a      Roy Orbison to television adverts' (3ii).\u000d\u000a    The same commitment, to tackle new and often contentious material and\u000d\u000a      thereby forcing the Welsh language to face up to modern complexities,\u000d\u000a      characterizes the sustained body of work by other members of this group.\u000d\u000a    In various poems contained within Cydio'n Dynn (1997) and Tafarn\u000a        Tawelwch (2003: 3iii), Prof. Gerwyn Wiliams (joined in 1989)\u000d\u000a      has investigated through his verse various instances of conflict as well\u000d\u000a      as the impact of media coverage on modern perceptions within the global\u000d\u000a      village. `Efrog Newydd Eto', included within Rhwng Gwibdaith a\u000d\u000a        Coldplay (2011: 3iv), was described by Gareth King (author of a\u000d\u000a      popular guide for learners of Welsh) as `a telling demonstration of the\u000d\u000a      capacity of this ancient linguistic tradition to find its voice in the\u000d\u000a      wider modern world' (5i).

While widely referred to as the most Welsh-speaking town in\u000d\u000a      Wales, this is the first novel to present a fictional version of\u000d\u000a      Caernarfon. The interface between private and public spheres is a\u000d\u000a      particular preoccupation for Professor Jerry Hunter (joined in\u000d\u000a      2003) in his Prose Medal-winning novel, Gwenddydd (2010: 3vii).\u000d\u000a      Alluding to the medieval prose tale of Myrddin, this tale of\u000d\u000a      post-traumatic stress disorder set during the Second World War has been\u000d\u000a      described by critics as `an important contribution to war literature in\u000d\u000a      Wales'. Hunter's most recent novel, Gwreiddyn Chwerw\u000d\u000a      (2012), is a ground-breaking novel which addresses the taboo subject of\u000d\u000a      neonaticide, rising to the challenge by adopting the persona of a female\u000d\u000a      first-person narrator.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"26758","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    i) Expanding the domains where Welsh is used by young people: By\u000a      2001, this issue was recognised as a principal strategic theme in language\u000a      planning in Wales. Citing `the research results', C6 acknowledged how\u000a      Gruffudd's research made them aware of the importance of influencing the\u000a      language of young people's languages domains. \u000a    As more and more Mentrau Iaith [Community Language Initiatives] came into\u000a      existence, so did the recognition through earlier experience with Mentrau\u000a      Myrddin that the use of Welsh by young people was a core area for\u000a      community language planning, policy and strategy. Gruffudd's research\u000a      findings were now influencing the planning processes of a variety of\u000a      beneficiaries from the grass roots level, to the Chief Executive of\u000a      Mentrau Iaith Myrddin (C3) and senior Welsh Language Board staff.\u000a    From 2008, planning for the use of Welsh by young people has become\u000a      central within all Mentrau Iaith, as evidenced by annual reports and\u000a      corporate plans (C7). All have appointed specific officers to promote the\u000a      use of Welsh with young people in the last five to ten years. The impact\u000a      of Gruffudd's research in the Carmarthenshire area has been particularly\u000a      noticeable, leading in recent years to Welsh language care clubs, the ownzone\u000a      project, a youth theatre and an innovative pastoral service as evidenced\u000a      in C8. C3 has stated that \"...the strategic development work carried\u000a        out by the Mentrau Iaith in Carmarthenshire with young people was\u000a        largely based on the research into language use by this particular age\u000a        group undertaken by Gruffudd. The model has now been used and adapted\u000a        across Wales, with Mentrau Iaith providing young people with more social\u000a        opportunities to use the language.\"\u000a    Recently, the use of Welsh by children and young people was identified as\u000a      an important strategic area by the Welsh government in `A living\u000a        language: a language for living &#8212; Welsh language strategy 2012-17',\u000a      pp. 28 - 32 (C9).\u000a    (ii) Embedding the tracking of linguistic progression between key\u000a        stages: The underpinning research highlighted marked differences in\u000a      approach in more traditionally Welsh-speaking counties, e.g.\u000a      Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire. The guidance given to parents and\u000a      students here was weak and Gruffudd argued for a more proactive approach.\u000a      As a direct consequence of Gruffudd's report, language progression policy\u000a      was revised. According to C2, the research has \"...ensured that\u000a        consideration of linguistic progression and the language continuum have\u000a        become embedded in the language and education planning processes of\u000a        Welsh county councils from 2008 onwards.\"\u000a    C4 has stated that: \"Ceredigion's Educational Language Strategy was\u000a        launched in 2008. Gruffudd's research was instrumental in informing and\u000a        guiding policy and practice. During the time immediately before the\u000a        blueprint for the Strategy was formed, Gruffudd was invited to visit the\u000a        Ceredigion Education Scrutiny Committee and address it on various\u000a        aspects of the research results. This undoubtedly contributed positively\u000a        towards the Authority's establishment of the Strategy, directly\u000a        informing the Strategy's tracking of Welsh-medium provision and\u000a        progression between different key stages and influencing the whole\u000a        process of establishing new schools in the county.... Recently, the\u000a        strategy was a factor in motivating Ysgol Gynradd Aberteifi to switch\u000a        from being a mixed-medium school to being a Welsh-medium school [...]\u000a        Unquestionably, this dependable body of research advanced the case for\u000a        improving Welsh-medium education in the county.\"\u000a    In 2010, the Welsh government produced its Welsh medium education\u000a        strategy (C10), describing it as `a historic milestone'. For the\u000a      first time ever, the Welsh government tracks and sets progression targets\u000a      for Welsh-medium education, between KS 2 and 3, and KS 3 and 4. `Local\u000a        authorities will be expected to agree targets for Welsh-medium\u000a        education, to be submitted as part of their Welsh in Education Strategic\u000a        Plans to DCELLS for annual monitoring from 2011.' (p.22) This\u000a      national strategy puts in place the proposals made by the research\u000a      commissioned by ACCAC in 2004, along with the previous reports by\u000a      Gruffudd.\u000a    (iii) Expanding Welsh medium school education in the context of\u000a        language policy for the normalisation of a minority language: RHAG [Parents\u000a        for Welsh medium Education] used the underpinning research as a\u000a      basis for its own normalisation plans for Welsh medium education. A\u000a      particular example of this [which can be corroborated by C5] is the 1999\u000a      plan RHAG formulated for the Swansea region. It argued for (i) a sixth\u000a      form at the only Welsh medium secondary school in the area, (ii) a second\u000a      Welsh medium secondary school, and (iii) new schools in areas of the\u000a      authority where lacunae were identified based on an analysis of demand\u000a      using Gruffudd's research's arguments for holistic, geographically\u000a      balanced, normalisation of the provision of Welsh medium primary schools.\u000a      The normalisation plan, again using the template provided by Gruffudd's\u000a      research, was presented in the context of enhancing national language\u000a      policy by contributing to the maintenance of Swansea's percentage of 13%\u000a      Welsh speakers and for the County to measure the demand for Welsh medium\u000a      education. During 2008 - 2013, (i) and (ii) had been embedded in the\u000a      system and a substantial inroad made into (iii) with two new schools\u000a      opening in areas high on the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation in 2011.\u000a      C11 notes a rise in the percentage of 7 year olds receiving Welsh medium\u000a      education in Swansea from 8.6% (2001) to 12.6% (2011).\u000a    Gruffudd's research has informed the activities of RHAG and persuaded him\u000a      to engage in the campaign for Welsh-medium education as the pressure\u000a      group's elected Chair in 2000-03 and 2009. He is presently its research\u000a      officer, and in 2012 was elected Chair of Dyfodol i'r Gymraeg, a\u000a      cross-party pressure group for the Welsh language.\u000a    RHAG has campaigned with parents and local government to develop Welsh\u000a      medium school education across Wales, leading to the opening of 15 new\u000a      Welsh medium primary schools since 2008. C12 provides an evaluation of the\u000a      growth of Welsh medium education 2002 to 2012.\u000a    The Welsh government's Welsh medium education strategy (C10),\u000a      states that it now expects `local authorities to plan effectively for\u000a      Welsh-medium provision' (p.13).

The primary\u000a      research was undertaken by Heini Gruffudd (lecturer in Welsh at Swansea\u000a      University 1990 to 2004) in response to the publication of seminal work by\u000a      the US sociolinguist Joshua Fishman, Reversing Language Shift in\u000a      1991. The underpinning research aimed at exploring issues from a Welsh\u000a      language context and adopted a methodology and rationale that were\u000a      informed by the theory of Reversing Language Shift [RLS] and the\u000a      intergenerational transmission of language.\u000a    This was the first time that research into the use of Welsh by young\u000a      people had been conducted in the context of RLS and in order to inform\u000a      holistic language planning at a community level. The communities looked at\u000a      in the research ranged from areas with low densities of Welsh speakers &#8212;\u000a      Port Talbot, Neath and Swansea city &#8212; to those with high densities &#8212; upper\u000a      Swansea Valley and East Carmarthenshire and found that pupils attending\u000a      16+ Welsh medium education were more likely to establish positive language\u000a      practices than those who had transferred to English medium provision [R1,\u000a      p.170]. Of particular concern were the negative attitudes of those who\u000a      attended comparatively weak forms of bilingual 16+ provision in areas of\u000a      higher densities of Welsh speakers. The main research conclusions informed\u000a      the three strands outlined in the impact summary above:\u000a    \u000a      The need to plan for the development of Welsh medium school education\u000a        in order to normalise the choice of language medium in education for all\u000a        young people in their local communities.\u000a      The need to ensure and track linguistic progression from primary to\u000a        secondary to sixth form levels to maximise positive attitudes to the use\u000a        of Welsh amongst young people at the critical 16+ age.\u000a      The need to provide a critical mass of Welsh speakers at the 16+ age\u000a        range in order to enhance opportunities to use the language in the\u000a        community and provide appropriate community structures.\u000a    \u000a    C1 described the findings of the research as having `...profound\u000a        implications for educational policy'. (Colin Williams (ed.), Language\u000a        Revitalization: Policy and Planning in Wales, (University of Wales\u000a      Press, 2000) p.37 and R5). On the basis of this initial report, Gruffudd\u000a      was commissioned by the Welsh Language Board to carry out further studies\u000a      in two regions of Carmarthenshire (R2 and R3). This was followed by a\u000a      commission by ACCAC (the Qualifications, Curriculum and Assessment\u000a      Authority for Wales) for research on language progression between the\u000a      primary and secondary sectors in Wales (R6). Given that the initial\u000a      research had highlighted strong correlation between community use of Welsh\u000a      and linguistic progression in school, ACCAC was particularly interested in\u000a      this aspect, as it tackled directly a concern of the Government Welsh\u000a      Language strategy document Iaith Pawb (2003: p40), namely that `It\u000a        appears that a drift from first language to second language occurs\u000a        as pupils transfer from primary to secondary school... We shall be\u000a        asking ACCAC.....to examine these issues in more detail.'\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28025","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context As a literary written language, Welsh has a rich and\u000a      unbroken tradition which extends\u000a      back to the middle ages. However, in the socio-political circumstances of\u000a      the Victorian era the\u000a      domains of Welsh remained largely confined to those of religion and\u000a      literature and English was\u000a      enthroned in Wales as the prestige language of education, commerce, public\u000a      administration and\u000a      law. It was not until the second half of the twentieth century that the\u000a      need to enhance the use of\u000a      Welsh beyond its Victorian domains became, first of all, a matter of\u000a      political agitation, and finally,\u000a      by the close of the century, a matter of political consensus in Wales\u000a      (5.3).\u000a    At the level of corpus planning, the enhanced use of Welsh in a growing\u000a      number of domains (e.g.,\u000a      education, law, broadcasting and technology) has necessitated a continual\u000a      process of linguistic\u000a      elaboration and terminological modernisation (5.3). BU's research in the\u000a      areas of lexicography and\u000a      terminology is at the heart of this process (5.3). Since 2008 BU has also\u000a      transformed the delivery\u000a      of such research to non-academic users through the creation of open-access\u000a      on-line databases\u000a      and through the use of other technological platforms (4.5).\u000a    (4.1) Throughout the assessment period of 2008-13, The Welsh\u000a        Academy English-Welsh\u000a        Dictionary (3.1) has been a corner-stone for the diversification of\u000a      the use of Welsh in contemporary\u000a      Wales. It fulfils the need for a major work of reference that has the\u000a      ability to mediate between\u000a      English, the dominant world language, and the growing use of Welsh outside\u000a      the traditional\u000a      domains of religion and literature. The Dictionary provides a standardized\u000a      lexicon extending from\u000a      public administration to nuclear physics. For bilingual public\u000a      administrators, educators,\u000a      broadcasters, editors and translators in Wales, it is the most essential\u000a      of tools to support the use of\u000a      Welsh in dynamic modern contexts (5.3). In offices and homes in Wales, and\u000a      on library shelves\u000a      throughout the English-speaking world, the Welsh Academy English-Welsh\u000a        Dictionary remains the\u000a      standard work on modern Welsh lexicon. In 2008, the Dictionary was\u000a      described by a former editor\u000a      of Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru (the historical Dictionary of the\u000a      Welsh Language) as `undoubtedly the\u000a      single greatest influence on present-day Welsh vocabulary' (5.5).\u000a    (4.3) As a tool that enhances the general use of Welsh, the\u000a      fundamental importance of the\u000a      Dictionary was recognized by the Welsh Language Board, which obtained a\u000a      licence from the\u000a      editors to publish a digital version. The Board, a statutory public body,\u000a      was created through the\u000a      Welsh Language Act of 1993 and its primary legal obligation was to promote\u000a      and facilitate the use\u000a      of Welsh in Wales on the basis of the equal validity of both Welsh and\u000a      English. In the Board's\u000a      Annual Review for 2008-9 it was stated that the `publication of a digital\u000a      version of this dictionary will\u000a      be a very important step in facilitating the use of Welsh, especially in\u000a      the bilingual Workplace' (5.6).\u000a      The fact that this highly prestigious and nationally important\u000a      digitisation project was entrusted in\u000a      2009 to LTU provides clear evidence of the unit's pre-eminence in the area\u000a      of language\u000a      technology.\u000a    In February 2012 the open-access digital version of the Dictionary (3.2)\u000a      was launched. The\u000a      event was marked by news reports on S4C and BBC Radio Cymru (28 February\u000a      2012), an article\u000a      in the weekly journal Golwg (23 February 2012), further coverage\u000a      in Y Cymro (2 March 2012), and\u000a      also an extended item as part of S4C's Pethe series (2 April 2012)\u000a      (5.11). At the time of the launch,\u000a      the Welsh Language Board's Chief-Executive stated that the Dictionary is\u000a      `an essential companion\u000a      to anyone who wishes to use Welsh' and that the digital version moved `the\u000a      Welsh language into a\u000a      completely different modern age' (5.10). This statement accurately\u000a      reflects the significance of the\u000a      impact of this work: between 13 March 2012 and 31 July 2013 the online\u000a      version of the Dictionary\u000a      received 1,756,000 searches, with an average of between 4,000 and 6,000\u000a      recorded during every\u000a      working day.\u000a    (4.4) As a result of the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure of 2011\u000a      the Welsh Language Board was\u000a      abolished on 1 April 2012 and its duties divided between the new Welsh\u000a      Language Commissioner\u000a      and the Welsh Government. The licence to produce a digital version of the\u000a      Dictionary was\u000a      transferred to the Commissioner who has assumed full responsibility for\u000a      maintaining and\u000a      developing the on-line Dictionary. The importance of this lexicographical\u000a      on-line resource is further\u000a      evidenced by A living language a language for living (2012), the\u000a      Welsh Government's Welsh\u000a      Language Strategy for 2012-17 which aims to see `an increase in the number\u000a      of people who both\u000a      speak and use the language'. The strategy states (p.49) that `the Welsh\u000a      Government will ensure\u000a      that the language can benefit from a standardized online Welsh language\u000a      dictionary, based on the\u000a      significant investment it has already committed to this project over time'\u000a      (5.8).\u000a    (4.5) The Termiadur: Standardized Terminology (3.3) was\u000a      commissioned by the Qualifications,\u000a      Curriculum and Assessment Authority for Wales\u000a      which became part of the Welsh Government's\u000a      new Department\u000a        for Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills in 2006. The volume\u000a      provides\u000a      standardized Welsh terminology for the provision of Welsh-medium education\u000a      in Wales and\u000a      provides standardized forms that are to be used in all curriculum\u000a      materials and external\u000a      examinations in Wales (5.1). Supported by the Welsh Government, the\u000a      greatly enhanced on-line\u000a      electronic version (3.4) now covers terms from the primary level right\u000a      through to further education\u000a      and it continues to grow. At the time of its launch in 2012, the Welsh\u000a      Government's Minister for\u000a      Education and Skills hailed the new electronic version as `a great boost\u000a      to Welsh-medium\u000a      education and to the language in general' (5.7).\u000a    The Termiadur Addysg is an essential tool for the provision of\u000a      Welsh-medium Education (5.1). In\u000a      the Welsh Government's Welsh-medium Education Strategy of 2010 the\u000a      need `to ensure that up-to-date,\u000a      standardized Welsh-language terminology is available to support all\u000a      aspects of Welsh-medium\u000a      provision' (p.18) was identified as a strategic objective (5.9). The Termiadur\u000a      in its various\u000a      print and electronic guises meets that objective. Its standardized\u000a      terminology is officially sanctioned\u000a      and used by the Welsh Joint Education Committee &#8212; Wales's national\u000a      examination board &#8212; in all its\u000a      educational and examination activity (5.1). Throughout the REF assessment\u000a      period, the Termiadur,\u000a      therefore, has enhanced the ability of teachers to deliver Welsh-medium\u000a      education with\u000a      terminological exactitude and competence and has enriched the educational\u000a      experiences of all\u000a      pupils in Wales who study their subjects through the medium of Welsh (that\u000a      number stood at\u000a      100,884 in January 2013: 63,192 primary \/ 37,692 secondary) (5.1).\u000a    The Termiadur also places Welsh in the technological world of\u000a      young people. As specified in A\u000a        living language a language for living (see above and 5.8) it is\u000a      `important . . . to facilitate the use of\u000a      Welsh in all aspects of public life, such as in the field of technology'\u000a      (p.49). Since 2012 a free app\u000a      version of the Termiadur has been available from the App Store,\u000a      Google Play and the Amazon App\u000a      Store for mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, that run on\u000a      iOS (iPad\/iPhone) or\u000a      Android. Y Termiadur Addysg is also available within the `ap\u000a        Geiriaduron app that also includes a\u000a      general language dictionary. Since its launch in March 2012, there have\u000a      been 197,394 searches of\u000a      the on-line Termiadur deriving from 33,883 visits. The Termiadur\u000a      has also been downloaded to\u000a      13,486 mobile devices, a statistic comparable with at least 1,500,000\u000a      downloads in an UK-English\u000a      context.\u000a    (4.7) Throughout the assessment period of 2008-13, BU's research\u000a      in the areas of lexicography\u000a      and terminology has been of fundamental importance to all professional\u000a      translators\/editors in\u000a      Wales. Cymdeithas Cyfieithwyr Cymru (The Association of Welsh Translators\u000a      and Interpreters) is\u000a      the national professional association of Welsh\/English translators and\u000a      interpreters. It has, at\u000a      various accreditation levels, 337 members who work in both public and\u000a      private sectors, including\u000a      SME's such as Cwmni Cymen in Caernarfon, Prysg in Cardiff, Trosol in\u000a      Castellnewydd\u000a      Emlyn\/Cardiff, and Trywydd in Carmarthen (5.4). All professional\u000a      translators and editors use the\u000a      Dictionary on a very regular if not daily basis and it is listed among the\u000a      bibliographical items\u000a      recommended for use by translators by the Association (5.4). For example,\u000a      since its establishment\u000a      in 1999 the National Assembly for Wales adheres to a rigorous bilingual\u000a      policy. Its Translation and\u000a      Reporting Service employs 41 translators\/editors and they are responsible\u000a      for the translation of\u000a      text, simultaneous translation and for producing and editing the\u000a      Assembly's Record of Proceedings\u000a      (5.2). During the 2012\/13 financial year they translated 3,353,500 words\u000a      of text, recorded and\u000a      edited 699 hours of Plenary and Committee deliberations and provided a\u000a      simultaneous translation\u000a      service during 2,180 hours of Assembly business and other formal Assembly\u000a      events (5.2). Their\u000a      work, which is given public visibility through National Assembly for\u000a      Wales's bilingual website,\u000a      enhances the use of Welsh in all of the policy areas of devolved power in\u000a      Wales: agriculture,\u000a      economic development, education, health, heritage, housing, industry,\u000a      local government, social\u000a      services, transport, tourism, and the Welsh language. Throughout the\u000a      working day they will\u000a      continually consult the Academy Dictionary. Their ability since 2012 to\u000a      conduct electronic searches\u000a      of the Dictionary has greatly impacted upon their working practices (5.2).\u000a      In the words of the Head\u000a      of the Assembly's Translation and Reporting Service, `it is difficult to\u000a      comprehend how the\u000a      professional translator in Wales could function without this dictionary'\u000a      (5.2).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The case study focuses on work undertaken at Bangor University (BU) in\u000a      two closely related fields,\u000a      Welsh lexicography and terminology.

It was the culmination of a major initiative in\u000a      the field of Welsh\u000a      lexicography instigated by the Welsh Academy and financially supported by\u000a      the Arts Council of\u000a      Wales, the British Academy, and the Welsh Office (of pre-devolved Wales).\u000a      Its publication in 1995\u000a      was hailed as `a milestone for the Welsh language' (Independent on\u000a        Sunday), and as a\u000a      monumental contribution `awesome in extent, scholarship [and] editorial\u000a      competence' (Reference\u000a        Reviews).\u000a    The Dictionary's format is based on the English-French half of Harrap's\u000a        Shorter French and\u000a        English Dictionary, but its 87,000 English headwords &#8212; and around 2\u000a      million words of text &#8212;\u000a      represent a much more ambitious undertaking. Its entries contain a\u000a      remarkable wealth of\u000a      illustrative quotations, exhaustive examples of idiomatic usage and\u000a      guidance throughout regarding\u000a      literary and colloquial registers. The Dictionary's lexicon encompasses\u000a      all areas of language use in\u000a      the modern world, including specialist and technical terms.\u000a    (2.2) Canolfan Bedwyr was established at BU in 1996 in memory of\u000a      Bedwyr Lewis Jones\u000a      (Professor of Welsh at BU between 1974 and 1992). Its aims are to enhance\u000a      the professional use\u000a      of Welsh within the university's administration and to offer professional\u000a      and research services to\u000a      external public and private bodies who wish to enhance the use of Welsh in\u000a      the workplace (see\u000a      REF3a). The Centre's Language Technologies Unit (LTU) is Wales's only\u000a      research unit on Welsh\u000a      terminology and language technologies, and it continues to build upon the\u000a      foundations laid by the\u000a      Welsh Academy Dictionary. In 2009 LTU was commissioned by the Welsh\u000a      Language Board to\u000a      undertake a major digitisation project relating to the Dictionary. In\u000a      February 2012, an on-line open-\u000a      access version of the Welsh Academy Dictionary was launched (3.2) and LTU\u000a      continues to be\u000a      responsible for its technical upkeep and development.\u000a    (2.3) Over the years LTU has made seminal contributions in the\u000a      area of Welsh terminology,\u000a      especially to meet to the needs of bilingual secondary and higher\u000a      education in Wales. What is the\u000a      Welsh for memory-stick, tablet, and fibre optic\u000a        broadband? Indeed, what is the Welsh for impact\u000a        case study and Research Excellence Framework? It is the\u000a      responsibility of BU's LTU to answer\u000a      such questions. Its Guidelines for the Standardization of Terminology\u000a        for the Welsh Assembly\u000a        Government and the Welsh Language Board (2007) have been adopted as\u000a      the official standard for\u000a      all areas of terminology in Wales.\u000a    In 2009 LTU received an European Regional Development\/Welsh Government\u000a      grant to aid the\u000a      translation industry in Wales, leading to the creation of Porth Termau (a\u000a      National Terminology\u000a      Portal for Wales). This is an electronic compendium of twenty terminology\u000a      dictionaries relating to\u000a      different fields (eight of which have been completed since 2007). It has\u000a      also been commissioned\u000a      by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol to undertake the 'Terms for Higher\u000a      Education' project with the\u000a      objective of developing a series of electronic subject dictionaries within\u000a      the priority fields of the\u000a      Welsh Government's national strategy for enhancing Welsh-medium tuition in\u000a      the higher education\u000a      sector.\u000a    (2.4) Y Termiadur: Welsh Terminology (3.3) is an updated\u000a      and much enlarged version of Y\u000a        Termiadur Ysgol (1998), originally commissioned by the\u000a      Qualifications, Curriculum and\u000a      Assessment Authority for Wales. It contains 46,000 entries covering\u000a      subjects taught at schools in\u000a      Wales up to Advanced-Level standard. New terms for inclusion were\u000a      researched and extracted\u000a      from relevant examination papers, syllabuses and text books. The\u000a      prescriptive nature of the\u000a      standardization process necessitated further research into Welsh candidate\u000a      terms and newly\u000a      published and revised ISO terminology standards.\u000a    In March 2012, a new on-line open-access version of Y Termiadur\u000a        Addysg was launched (3.4).\u000a      With 58,000+ terms, it includes a new enlarged version of the text\u000a      published in 2006 and continues\u000a      to grow. It also has additional features to aid searching for standardized\u000a      terms to be used in Welsh\u000a      medium exams and assessments and in resources of all kinds for teachers\u000a      and students.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28112","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context\u000a      Prior to the dissemination of this research, it was generally accepted\u000a      that the formally codified\u000a      prestige variety (Hochdeutsch) was the only acceptable basis for teaching\u000a      GFL. The significant\u000a      impact of this research has been to stimulate debate about whether this\u000a      variety of German is\u000a      actually the only appropriate form of the language to be taught to\u000a      non-native speakers, whether in\u000a      school or for adult instruction. The essential conclusion, which has now\u000a      become generally\u000a      accepted, is that it is no longer appropriate to teach German as it should\u000a      be spoken (i.e. as\u000a      prescribed by the strict codifications laid down in authoritative\u000a      publications, which are widely\u000a      ignored by native speakers), but as it actually is spoken.\u000a    Pathways\u000a      This conclusion became more widely disseminated internationally through\u000a      encouragement by the\u000a      Professor of German Studies at the University of Wuppertal and a senior\u000a      colleague in German\u000a      Linguistics and Translation Studies at the Copenhagen Business School and\u000a      their invitation to\u000a      contribute to a conference in 2004 [5.1] on the status of German and the\u000a      teaching of the language\u000a      organised by the DAAD in Berlin and attended by some two hundred scholars\u000a      from across Europe,\u000a      as well as to a special issue of Der Deutschunterricht (the\u000a      leading publication aimed at teachers of\u000a      German language within Germany [3.5], as well as to a collected volume of\u000a      papers on the\u000a      principles which should underlie the teaching of German as a foreign\u000a      language [3.2]. This volume,\u000a      of some 550 pages, contains 36 papers by leading scholars (30 of\u000a      professorial status) from 12\u000a      European countries, and Japan.\u000a    The views put forward in these papers and presentations of the early- to\u000a      mid-2000s were initially\u000a      rejected by the conservative teaching establishment within Germany, which\u000a      held to the opinion that\u000a      it was the duty of teachers only to impart 'correct' German to non-native\u000a      learners. This opinion had\u000a      informed all previous textbooks despite claims in them that they presented\u000a      actual current usage.\u000a      However, the conclusions were broadly welcomed by secondary and tertiary\u000a      level teachers of GFL\u000a      in other European countries and have proven to play a central role in the\u000a      development of curricula\u000a      [5.2; 5.8]. This is confirmed by the further references to Durrell's\u000a      papers in the volume edited by the\u000a      Professor of German Studies at the University of Wupperta l5.3] in respect\u000a      of changing teaching\u000a      practice at the Goethe Institute in Glasgow. The Goethe Institute is the\u000a      organization which in turn\u000a      influences the teaching of German across the globe.\u000a    Reach and Significance\u000a      In the last few years, the discussions underpinned by the research have\u000a      had increasingly\u000a      substantial impact as the conclusions become more widely accepted for the\u000a      practice of teaching\u000a      GFL. The papers on the language variety to be used in teaching were in\u000a      particular taken up in\u000a      2009 (with a precursor in 2007) as the basis for a debate in the journal\u000a      Info-DaF ] between Werner\u000a      Roggausch, the former head of teaching at the DAAD, and P&#233;ter Maitz\u000a      (Augsburg) with Stefan\u000a      Elspa&#223; (Sakzburg) [5.4]. The debate informs the Project \"Gesprochenes\u000a      Deutsch f&#252;r die\u000a      Auslandsgermanistik\" (Spoken German for the study of German outside\u000a      Germany) at the\u000a      University of M&#252;nster [5.5]. This is funded by the DAAD in order to\u000a      assemble a corpus of authentic\u000a      spoken language material which can be used by teachers of German as a\u000a      foreign language.\u000a    Systematic account is now being taken of the need to base the oral\u000a      component of second\u000a      language instruction in German on the variety which German native speakers\u000a      actually use in\u000a      everyday communication and introduce this variety as well as the prestige\u000a      variety of formal writing.\u000a      Teaching manuals are now being produced which reflect this, notably the\u000a      new textbook Menschen\u000a      which was published in early 2012 by Hueber in Munich [5.6; 5.7]. Hueber\u000a      is the leading publisher\u000a      of instruction manuals for teaching German, and its products are most\u000a      frequently adopted by the\u000a      Goethe-Institute. The impact of Durrell's work in stimulating the\u000a      reassessment on which these\u000a      developments have been based is confirmed by the Heads of the Herder\u000a      Institute in Leipzig (the\u000a      leading university-based institute for Deutsch als Fremdsprache) noting\u000a      the `profound impact on\u000a      German studies and GFL\/GSL' worldwide [5.2] and the Head of the Department\u000a      of Deutsch als\u000a      Fremdsprache at the University of Munich [5.10]. Publications by the lead\u000a      researchers on the\u000a      University of M&#252;nster project, confirm the impact of the research in\u000a      stimulating these developments\u000a      and forming the initiative for the project [5.9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This impact is on educational policy and practice in relation to the\u000a      international teaching of German\u000a      as a foreign language and is based on research into differences in\u000a      linguistic variation between\u000a      England and Germany. The differences lie in: perception of non-standard\u000a      varieties in the two\u000a      countries; the status of the standard language in each; and different\u000a      attitudes towards it. The\u000a      research stimulated debate, in Germany and abroad, about the variety of\u000a      German appropriate for\u000a      use in classroom instruction, and resulted in acceptance that teaching\u000a      only the register of formal\u000a      writing is not adequate to the needs of contemporary communication.

The research led by him took place throughout this\u000a      period, with the first\u000a      major publication in 1999. It investigated qualitative differences in\u000a      linguistic variation in England\u000a      and Germany and the implication of this for the practice of teaching\u000a      German as a foreign language\u000a      (GFL) at all levels in the UK.\u000a    The first stage was a detailed study [3.3] of the different perception of\u000a      non-standard varieties in the\u000a      two countries, and the different status of the standard language. In\u000a      Germany the traditional\u000a      perception, it was found, is of (a) regional dialects -- until very\u000a      recently the primary language of\u000a      most of the population and (b) a rigidly codified standard language\u000a      acquired solely through\u000a      education and not representative of the spoken usage of any section of the\u000a      population. In England,\u000a      the variety regarded as standard lacks the level of codification of German\u000a      and is based on norms\u000a      accepted by a particular social group, whilst non-standard varieties are\u000a      primarily associated with\u000a      particular social strata and regions.\u000a    However, the relative flexibility of the `standard' norms allows for\u000a      significant variation between\u000a      formal and informal discourse in a way that was unusual for standard\u000a      German. A further key finding\u000a      was that there has been a significant recent development in Germany: the\u000a      use of the `traditional'\u000a      regional dialects has declined rapidly since the middle of the twentieth\u000a      century, and the use has\u000a      increased of a spoken form closer to the standard language &#8212; an informal\u000a      register with relatively\u000a      high prestige not dissimilar to that in England, but lacking the\u000a      association with social class typical\u000a      of the situation there.\u000a    A second stage investigated the implication of these findings for the\u000a      teaching of GFL. The results\u000a      of this [3.1; 3.2; 3.4; 3.5] inform the account in the second edition of\u000a      Durrell's Using German [3.6].\u000a      Here the concern was that teaching practice had been determined by the\u000a      `ideology of standard',\u000a      the notion that only the formally codified standard language (so-called\u000a      Hochdeutsch) is `good'\u000a      German and hence the only acceptable basis for classroom teaching, within\u000a      the German speech\u000a      area or outside it. Thus, the German generally taught was not the language\u000a      variety learners would\u000a      be faced with most often in practice.\u000a    This was clearly demonstrated in a survey undertaken in collaboration\u000a      with Dr Nils Langer\u000a      (University of Bristol) [3.4]. This showed that students could be\u000a      penalized for employing forms even\u000a      in speech which, although almost universally employed by native speakers\u000a      in informal situations,\u000a      did not correspond to the prescriptions of the rigidly codified variety of\u000a      formal writing. This variety,\u000a      then, was being taught as if it was also normal usage in everyday speech.\u000a      Learners could therefore\u000a      find it difficult to participate effectively in the type of speech\u000a      situation which they would encounter\u000a      most frequently, the inevitable result being insecurity and demotivation.\u000a      It was also shown that this\u000a      contrasts markedly with the presentation of the language in comparable\u000a      manuals for learning\u000a      English, where the informal spoken register is introduced at an early\u000a      stage and the differences\u000a      between this and formal writing made explicit [3.1; 3.5]\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28113","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context\u000d\u000a    Everett's findings about the Pirah&#227; language has two salient claims that\u000d\u000a      were to have impact on a\u000d\u000a      non-academic audience -- that Pirah&#227; syntax lacks the Chinese-boxes\u000d\u000a      structures of `recursion',\u000d\u000a      and that the language lacks a way of counting or referring to number. This\u000d\u000a      challenged current\u000d\u000a      beliefs about the defining properties of human language and about the\u000d\u000a      relation between human\u000d\u000a      language and cognition. Backed by Everett's explorations and hypotheses,\u000d\u000a      this meant that it\u000d\u000a      touched on what it means to be human and this naturally created curiosity\u000d\u000a      amongst a wide public.\u000d\u000a      Debates around Everett's work continue to change the ways in which\u000d\u000a      language and cultural\u000d\u000a      difference might be thought about.\u000d\u000a    Pathways to impact\u000d\u000a    Professor Everett has carried out fieldwork on the Pirah&#227; language in the\u000d\u000a      Amazon region since the\u000d\u000a      1980s and more recently also on other Amazonian languages. The work has\u000d\u000a      progressed through\u000d\u000a      the research outputs and public events (e.g., at University of Manchester\u000d\u000a      10 May 2006, with the\u000d\u000a      participation of Suya indigenous leaders from Brazil), on into the popular\u000d\u000a      success of Don't Sleep,\u000d\u000a      There are Snakes (Profile Books\/Pantheon Books, 2008) through to Language:\u000d\u000a      The Cultural Tool\u000d\u000a      (Profile Books, 2012). It has incrementally contributed to public\u000d\u000a      discourse and enhanced the public\u000d\u000a      understanding of a range of cultural and linguistic issues.\u000d\u000a    Reach and Significance\u000d\u000a    The reach of Everett's research is clear in the sales figures, which also\u000d\u000a      represent a contribution to\u000d\u000a      economic prosperity. Don't Sleep... had sold nearly 100,000 copies by\u000d\u000a      autumn 2011 and was\u000d\u000a      nominated for US National Book Award.\u000d\u000a    A wide range of people whose work in the media involves initiating public\u000d\u000a      debate and challenging\u000d\u000a      existing conceptions were influenced by the academic work. The fact that\u000d\u000a      they decided to pick it up\u000d\u000a      in media aimed at the public is evidence of the scope of the work and the\u000d\u000a      significance of the\u000d\u000a      impact. The sheer breadth of such activity around this case can be\u000d\u000a      considered indirect evidence of\u000d\u000a      further impact: coverage in the UK newspapers (e.g., The Guardian [5.1]\u000d\u000a      and on the BBC [5.8]) are\u000d\u000a      matched internationally with coverage, for example, on the Finnish\u000d\u000a      Broadcasting company YLE (1\u000d\u000a      June 2007), in The New Yorker [5.2] (in 2007) and in a full-page article\u000d\u000a      on Everett and his work in\u000d\u000a      Frankfurter Algemeine [5.3] (in 2010).\u000d\u000a    The surprising facts relating to numeral expressions and recursion are\u000d\u000a      referred to on individuals'\u000d\u000a      webblogs around the world and in many languages [5.4].

Many of these interviews are picked up on other\u000d\u000a      public debate websites or those\u000d\u000a      of individuals.\u000d\u000a    A documentary film has been made based around Everett's experiences and\u000d\u000a      discoveries entitled\u000d\u000a      The Grammar of Happiness (Essential Media &amp; Entertainment production\u000d\u000a      with ABC Australia and\u000d\u000a      Arte France.

During\u000d\u000a      this time he published a\u000d\u000a      series of theoretical conclusions arising from data collected on nearly\u000d\u000a      two decades of fieldtrips to\u000d\u000a      the Amazon ([3.1] and [3.2] focus on the practicalities of fieldwork,\u000d\u000a      [3.3] and [3.4] on the theoretical\u000d\u000a      conclusions). The research was funded by the ESRC, the AHRB, the National\u000d\u000a      Science Foundation\u000d\u000a      and the EU.\u000d\u000a    Its conclusions go radically against assumptions central to some major\u000d\u000a      linguistic theories and are\u000d\u000a      especially challenging to Chomsky's claim that all human beings are\u000d\u000a      endowed with an innate\u000d\u000a      language faculty or Universal Grammar (UG). Reactions from fellow\u000d\u000a      academics as reported in the\u000d\u000a      press give an indication of how radical the theoretical conclusions were\u000d\u000a      within the academic\u000d\u000a      context, with Steven Pinker (Harvard) referring to Everett's work as `a\u000d\u000a      bomb thrown into the party'\u000d\u000a      [5.2] and Patricia Churchland (University of California, San Diego)\u000d\u000a      declaring herself `thunderstruck\u000d\u000a      by the research on language and its origins' [5.5]. The academic debate is\u000d\u000a      captured, for example,\u000d\u000a      at [3.5 &amp; 3.6].\u000d\u000a    Recursion or recursive embedding refers to the way in which the syntax of\u000d\u000a      a language permits a\u000d\u000a      phrase to occur as part of a phrase of the same category &#8212; for example a\u000d\u000a      clause may occur inside\u000d\u000a      a clause which is in turn inside another clause and so on &#8212; hence giving\u000d\u000a      rise to potentially limitless\u000d\u000a      linguistic expressions. Recursion had been described as `the only uniquely\u000d\u000a      human component of\u000d\u000a      the faculty of language' by Hauser, Chomsky &amp; Fitch (2002:1569)3,\u000d\u000a      but Everett argued that this\u000d\u000a      fundamental property is absent in Pirah&#227;.\u000d\u000a    With respect to number, Everett's claim is that the language does not\u000d\u000a      have a system for referring to\u000d\u000a      the sequence of natural numbers in a way that we would recognise. He\u000d\u000a      argued that his results\u000d\u000a      show that language for exact numbers is a cultural invention rather than a\u000d\u000a      linguistic universal, and\u000d\u000a      that number words do not change our underlying representations of number\u000d\u000a      but instead are a\u000d\u000a      cognitive technology for keeping track of the cardinality of large sets\u000d\u000a      across time, space, and\u000d\u000a      changes in modality.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28114","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This case study's wider impact has been to modify accounts of the\u000d\u000a      changing status of the\u000d\u000a      broadcast media in Russia and Europe more generally (Key Findings, Section\u000d\u000a      2) by (a)\u000d\u000a      complicating notions of the Russian public sphere held by relevant\u000d\u000a      government agencies; (b)\u000d\u000a      reshaping the approach taken by European policy makers and NGOs to\u000d\u000a      inter-ethnic and inter-faith\u000d\u000a      tensions; (c) changing public perceptions of media, diversity and free\u000d\u000a      speech in Russia.\u000d\u000a    The work has exerted influence on policy-makers, through a series\u000d\u000a      of (i) consultancy activities and\u000d\u000a      (ii) workshops, (iii) debates and (iv) training:\u000d\u000a    (i) In February of 2008 the US State Department commissioned a\u000d\u000a      consultancy with Hutchings\u000d\u000a      about the role of new media technology in promoting the Kremlin's\u000d\u000a      political agenda.

A BBC journalist attending\u000d\u000a      was struck by the extent to\u000d\u000a      which the Russian `media follow social agendas' set by the public rather\u000d\u000a      than political dictates.\u000d\u000a      Other comments by attending professionals included an Open Society\u000d\u000a      Foundation representative\u000d\u000a      on journalistic ethics and the director of the Equal Rights Trust on free\u000d\u000a      speech and radical\u000d\u000a      nationalism.

The key researchers were Professor Stephen Hutchings\u000d\u000a      (2006-date) and Professor\u000d\u000a      Vera Tolz (2004-date).\u000d\u000a    Focus of Research\u000d\u000a    The research focused on the relationship between television and power in\u000d\u000a      Russia, accounting for\u000d\u000a      the globalised media environment in which Russian television operates. Its\u000d\u000a      main areas of concern\u000d\u000a      were: (i) the role of broadcasting in the post-Soviet nation building\u000d\u000a      project [3.1, 3.2]; (ii) the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of television as a tool of political consensus management;\u000d\u000a      and (iii) the mediation of\u000d\u000a      multicultural values in the context of the growth of radical Islam within\u000d\u000a      Russia's Southern periphery,\u000d\u000a      and of inter-ethnic tensions in its heartlands, and in comparison with\u000d\u000a      other European broadcasters\u000d\u000a      [3.3]. The time period covered was 2003-2013. Most attention was paid to\u000d\u000a      the main state\u000d\u000a      broadcasters (Channel 1, Rossia, and NTV). For 2006-09, BBC1 and France 2\u000d\u000a      broadcasts were\u000d\u000a      also recorded and analysed.\u000d\u000a    Methods\u000d\u000a    These included the establishment of a corpus of recordings, digitised,\u000d\u000a      annotated and catalogued\u000d\u000a      according to a typology of news categories, enabling the team to generate\u000d\u000a      datasets analysing\u000d\u000a      volumes of coverage, salience, running orders and changing news agendas.\u000d\u000a      These underpinned\u000d\u000a      detailed discourse analyses centring on the role of post-Soviet television\u000d\u000a      genre formats in\u000d\u000a      `localising' global meanings, ideological gate-keeping strategies; the\u000d\u000a      framing and representation of\u000d\u000a      voices; lexical choice; narrative structures; the sequencing of images.\u000d\u000a    Key Findings\u000d\u000a    Established accounts of the changing status of the broadcast media in\u000d\u000a      Russia since 1991 tell of a\u000d\u000a      slow descent into authoritarian state control, including the brutal\u000d\u000a      suppression of facts relating to the\u000d\u000a      crushing of separatist movements in the Islamic North Caucasus. They\u000d\u000a      contribute to the\u000d\u000a      emergence of new cold war tensions between Russia and the West, even as\u000d\u000a      both parties inscribe\u000d\u000a      themselves into the global War on Terror in the context of shared notions\u000d\u000a      of a crisis in\u000d\u000a      multiculturalism, and the growing securitisation of public discourse. The\u000d\u000a      research underpinning this\u000d\u000a      case study challenges these accounts in a number of ways:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Far from the top-down `management' associated with state-controlled\u000d\u000a        media, Russian\u000d\u000a        national television serves as the site of a complex circulation of a\u000d\u000a        plurality of discourses,\u000d\u000a        official, sub-official and unofficial, in which each modifies the other.\u000d\u000a      Project findings enabled the researchers to produce a subtly\u000d\u000a        differentiated `mapping' of\u000d\u000a        Russian media space revealing that state broadcasters varied their\u000d\u000a        output depending on\u000d\u000a        their position in relation to shifting populist discourses of `left' and\u000d\u000a        `right'.\u000d\u000a      This, together with the ability to trace the legacy of Soviet\u000d\u000a        practices, produced further\u000d\u000a        insights into how voices at the extremes of the Russian public sphere\u000d\u000a        (nationalist and\u000d\u000a        liberal) are `mainstreamed' within\/excluded from broadcasting agendas.\u000d\u000a      The team identified parallels linking Russian television\u000d\u000a        representations of Muslims, and\u000d\u000a        those of the BBC and France 2, as well as sharp divergences, including a\u000d\u000a        repression of the\u000d\u000a        Islamic dimension to domestic terrorism.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Islam's prominent role within the securitisation of European public\u000d\u000a      discourse is less the result of\u000d\u000a      media Islamophobia, than of (a) complex inconsistencies in the national\u000d\u000a      value systems\u000d\u000a      broadcasters represent, and (b) difficulties in assimilating competing\u000d\u000a      transnational flows of\u000d\u000a      meaning surrounding the `War on Terror' to national idioms.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28115","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context\u000a      Professor Matras' research has made a major contribution to raising\u000a      awareness and promoting the\u000a      study of the Romani language among general audiences worldwide. The Romani\u000a      are one of the\u000a      most vulnerable and marginalized populations in Europe and the UK and\u000a      little research has been\u000a      carried out into their language. The work of Professor Matras fills a\u000a      significant gap and directly\u000a      contributes to education by informing individuals and authorities about\u000a      Romani cultural heritage\u000a      and language. He has also influenced policy making in European\u000a      organisations in regard to the\u000a      status, regulation and promotion of Romani.\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000a      The results of Professor Matras' research have been disseminated through a\u000a      number of online\u000a      education tools, DVDs and broadcasts on the BBC. The main pathways to\u000a      policy impacts are to be\u000a      found at the European level and are based on research published in a\u000a      peer-refereed journal and in\u000a      a monograph, among other outlets. The importance and visibility of the\u000a      results made European\u000a      policy makers aware of its potential impact. In October 2005 the Expert\u000a      Committee for the\u000a      European Charter on Minority or Regional Languages adopted Matras'\u000a      recommendations to\u000a      encourage the recognition of Romani by member states and to support\u000a      regional codification [5.1].\u000a      The results of Professor Matras' research into linguistic pluralism in\u000a      Romani were also\u000a      disseminated widely within the community of Romani cultural activists via\u000a      the publication Roma\u000a        Rights Quarterly.\u000a    Reach and Significance\u000a      International impact on Romani language education and preservation\u000a      In 2006 Professor Matras launched the Romani linguistics website [5.2] to\u000a      preserve the\u000a      endangered language and culture of one of the world's most marginalised\u000a      and maligned\u000a      populations. The site contains transcriptions of the many Romani dialects\u000a      for the first time and\u000a      allows people to locate different dialects on a world map and listen to\u000a      examples of them. Since the\u000a      launch it's been accessed by an average of 25,000 individuals every year\u000a      and visitors have IP\u000a      addresses from over 40 countries.\u000a    An educational DVD-ROM called `Romani: An interactive journey' was\u000a      created by Professor Matras\u000a      and his team. Over 8,000 hard copies have been sent to educational outlets\u000a      in the UK and abroad\u000a      including 6,500 since January 2008. Over 35,000 have been directly\u000a      downloaded from the website\u000a      since January 2008 and overall 40,000 have been downloaded since its\u000a      publication in May 2007.\u000a    The online Romani dictionary `Romlex' which was developed in\u000a      collaboration with partners at Graz\u000a      University in Austria has become the major reference resource for writers\u000a      and learners of Romani.\u000a      It has been accessed by an average of 70,000 users each year since its\u000a      launch in 2005. By\u000a      simultaneously covering multiple dialects, Romlex has supported the\u000a      process of de-centralised,\u000a      regional codification and language planning by lending support to\u000a      teachers, translators and\u000a      interpreters of the Romani language. The Romlex project also ran a trainee\u000a      programme between\u000a      2003 and 2007 which saw more than 40 individuals of Romani origin receive\u000a      training through work\u000a      placements on projects at the universities of Manchester and Graz. Two of\u000a      these trainees\u000a      continued to postgraduate studies at The University of Manchester in 2007\u000a      and around 10 continue\u000a      to work as part-time research and fieldwork assistants for both\u000a      universities. They set an example\u000a      and a precedent for the integration of young people of Romani background\u000a      into academic research\u000a      on Romani themes at the highest level.\u000a    Impact on national Romani language education and preservation\u000a      Professor Matras' research into Angloromani has raised the awareness and\u000a      promoted the inclusion\u000a      of information on Romani in the media and the education curriculum in the\u000a      UK. In 2007 the BBC\u000a      published a contribution by Professor Matras on Romani on its `Voices'\u000a      website [5.3]. The Audio-CD\u000a\u0009  `Romani Soundbites' produced by Professor Matras and associates was\u000a      broadcast by BBC\u000a      Three Counties Radio in December 2008.\u000a    From 2008 to 2009 outlets of the Ethnic Minority Achievement Unit and the\u000a      Traveler Education\u000a      Services adopted Professor Matras' audio-visual educational tools to\u000a      promote awareness of the\u000a      Romani language for use in schools and other educational and training\u000a      activities. Many thousands\u000a      of pupils have since had access to these tools [5.4]. Testimonies from\u000a      English Romani Gypsies\u000a      collected during the annual fair at Appleby in June 2012 [5.5] document\u000a      the impact that Professor\u000a      Matras' CDs and CD-ROM productions have had on encouraging members of the\u000a      community to\u000a      explore the origins, history and structure of their ancestral language.\u000a    Impact on Policy\u000a      The main impact on policy has been at a European level. As a direct\u000a      outcome of the Expert\u000a      Committee's adoption of Matras' recommendations, annual reports submitted\u000a      as part of the\u000a      monitoring process by national governments of member states who are\u000a      signatory to the Charter\u000a      have since 2008 made regular reference to Romani.\u000a    The Council of Europe's Language Policy Division adopted Professor\u000a      Matras' recommendation to\u000a      support ongoing polycentric and pluralistic approaches to the codification\u000a      of Romani. This includes\u000a      using written forms based on different dialects and with a variety of\u000a      spelling conventions [5.1]. In\u000a      response to Professor Matras' report to the Language Policy Division, it\u000a      set up a working group\u000a      which delivered the European Curriculum Framework for Romani in 2008\u000a      [5.6]. The Framework is\u000a      currently serving as a basis for the development and delivery of Romani\u000a      language programmes in\u000a      10 different countries. The European Union has sponsored two separate\u000a      implementation projects\u000a      devoted to the design of teaching and learning materials on the basis of\u000a      the Framework via its\u000a      Lifelong Learning Programme: RomaniNet (2010-2012) and QualiRom\u000a      (2011-2013) [5.7, 5.8].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research by Professor Yaron Matras produced tools to promote\u000a      awareness of the Romani\u000a      language through popular websites, online documentation, learning\u000a      resources and audio-visual\u000a      educational materials.

It was supported by a research team at the university between\u000a      2000 and 2012. Key\u000a      external collaborators were:\u000a    Dieter Halwachs, the University of Graz, Austria\u000a      Peter Bakker, Aarhus University, Denmark\u000a    The key research steps were:\u000a    \u000a      An assessment of written usages and participant observations on use of\u000a        the Romani\u000a        language in the public domain was carried out. Professor Matras\u000a        concluded that a bottom-\u000a        up process of the expansion of written Romani is taking place. He found\u000a        it has a polycentric\u000a        and pluralistic character which is being aided by new technologies to\u000a        allow the co-existence\u000a        and efficient communication in multiple forms. [3.1, 3.2]\u000a      Data was then collected in over 150 varieties of Romani in 22\u000a        different countries. The\u000a        results were compiled and presented in a universally accessible online\u000a        database\u000a        http:\/\/romani.humanities.manchester.ac.uk\/rms\/.\u000a        The evaluation focused on the extent and\u000a        nature of structural variation among the dialects of Romani and the\u000a        insights that this offers\u000a        for a reconstruction of the language's historical development history.\u000a        [3.3]\u000a      Research into lexical variation in Romani was carried out from\u000a        2001-2005. The procedure\u000a        involved an evaluation of major published dictionaries of Romani,\u000a        supported by targeted\u000a        lexical elicitation among native speakers and an evaluation of a body of\u000a        electronic texts.\u000a        The project created the first-ever online multi-dialectal dictionary in\u000a        any language called\u000a        `Romlex' http:\/\/romani.uni-graz.at\/romlex\/.\u000a        It currently offers an online lexical database of 25\u000a        Romani dialects with search and translation facilities in 14 different\u000a        target languages. The\u000a        targeted documentation of `new vocabulary' has provided further insights\u000a        into the\u000a        codification process in Romani.\u000a    \u000a    Professor Matras and his research team then studied the emergence of a\u000a      mixed variety of Romani\u000a      called `Angloromani'. This is based on Romani-derived vocabulary among\u000a      English and Welsh\u000a      Gypsies. A number of recorded interviews with users in over 40 locations\u000a      in England and Wales\u000a      took place between 2006 and 2008 and the historical, structural and\u000a      conversational features of\u000a      Angloromani were assessed [3.4].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28116","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context\u000a      The research supported a range of activities that helped raise awareness\u000a      of, and promote public\u000a      discourse on language diversity in the context of immigration to urban\u000a      centres. The resulting\u000a      activities supported local public services that were seeking access to and\u000a      communication with\u000a      ethnic and linguistic minorities in Manchester. The authorities were\u000a      seeking to improve the quality\u000a      of their services to this target population through a better understanding\u000a      of the social, cultural and\u000a      emotional aspects of bilingualism.\u000a    Pathways to impact\u000a      The research has been published in leading journals and presented at key\u000a      events. In 2008\u000a      Professor Matras delivered a keynote address at the opening event of\u000a      UNESCO's Year of\u000a      Languages activities [5.1]. An inaugural public event for Multilingual\u000a      Manchester (MLM) (November\u000a      2010) [5.2], in which Matras has a leading role, attracted around 100\u000a      participants from local\u000a      services and city council agencies. An interactive exhibition on\u000a      multilingualism was organised by\u000a      Professor Matras' research team at the Manchester Histories Week at\u000a      Manchester Museum in\u000a      February 2012 [5.3], attended by some 300 people. Responses in social\u000a      media to MLM's work\u000a      have built steadily since 2010 [5.4].\u000a    Impact on the provision of data to agencies and policy makers\u000a      Data on multilingualism in Manchester collected by undergraduate and\u000a      postgraduate students was\u000a      processed by the research team and included in an online archive [5.2].\u000a      Set up in 2010 it aims to\u000a      document, protect and support the languages spoken in Manchester and it is\u000a      now one of the\u000a      world's largest online language archives. It contains over 100 reports on\u000a      multilingualism and\u000a      language minorities in Manchester covering a diverse range of dialects,\u000a      including Chitrali from\u000a      North Pakistan, Konkani from Western India, Dagaare from Ghana and Burkina\u000a      Faso and Uyghur\u000a      from NW China.\u000a    Since its launch in October 2010, the research-driven archive has been\u000a      consulted by some 3,000\u000a      individuals, 80% of them external to The University of Manchester, via\u000a      some 850 service providers.\u000a      Access statistics from Google Analytics [5.5] show interest in the\u000a      resource from Manchester City\u000a      Council, the NHS, and the European Commission as well as academic\u000a      institutions and private\u000a      access through commercial service providers.\u000a    Impact on health care in Manchester\u000a      In July 2012 NHS Manchester consulted Professor Matras on prioritising\u000a      languages for information\u000a      on access to health care. This allowed the underpinning research to form\u000a      the basis of decisions\u000a      taken by the NHS in producing a series of online videos and animations in\u000a      various languages that\u000a      contain health care advice. An interactive exhibition on multilingual\u000a      community issues was\u000a      displayed at Manchester Royal Infirmary as part of Language Awareness Week\u000a      (May 2013) [5.6].\u000a    Impact on education and communities\u000a      Awareness of the research, through the pathways described, led Gorton\u000a      Mount Primary School to\u000a      consult Professor Matras on surveying and identifying language needs and\u000a      strengthening literacy\u000a      acquisition skills among pupils of multilingual background. The launch of\u000a      a website on the Kurdish\u000a      language [5.7] by Matras in September 2011 was followed up by an event in\u000a      the Kurdish\u000a      community of Greater Manchester (November) and the distribution of\u000a      information leaflets about the\u000a      project in the community. As a result, several community members came\u000a      forward to offer their\u000a      assistance in carrying out Kurdish language documentation, either as\u000a      speaker consultants or\u000a      fieldwork assistants. The project has also received attention from the\u000a      Kurdish Regional\u000a      Government and its representatives in Europe. Matras was invited on\u000a      several occasions to visit the\u000a      KRG offices in London and in Paris, and to give a talk at the Kurdish\u000a      Institute in Paris, where the\u000a      project was presented to a large audience in October 2011.\u000a    Reach and significance\u000a      Following on from the initial Pathways, a second public event on\u000a      multilingualism in Manchester in\u000a      October 2012 attracted keynote participants from the education sector,\u000a      Greater Manchester's\u000a      police and fire services and the NHS [5.8] and received local press\u000a      coverage [5.9], adding to the\u000a      pre-existing national coverage [5.9]. All these agencies publicly\u000a      acknowledged the contribution of\u000a      Professor Matras' research into multilingualism in Manchester and the\u000a      impact it has had on the\u000a      delivery of their services especially to ethnic and linguistic minority\u000a      communities. Press coverage of\u000a      the event has prompted debate in the national press which takes the\u000a      project forward:by 15 January\u000a      2013, 270 comments were posted in reaction to coverage in the Daily\u000a        Mail &#8212; many of these\u000a      invigoratingly polarised &#8212; and 176 comments to the Guardian's\u000a      coverage, and 66 responses to that\u000a      in the Manchester Evening News, reporting on how `the findings\u000a      reveal the incredible diversity of\u000a      Manchester &#8212; with Somali, Urdu, and Yiddish being commonly spoken, along\u000a      with more exotic\u000a      dialects including Yoruba, Aramaic, and Armenian' and how `the [project]\u000a      team have interviewed\u000a      hundreds of community groups, businesses, and local people' [5.10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research by Professor Yaron Matras has impacted on the way local\u000a      services communicate\u000a      with minority populations by encouraging them to re-assess language needs.\u000a      It has had its effects\u000a      in the fields of health and welfare, education, and policy making in\u000a      relation public services. In\u000a      particular it has demonstrated the need to base language policy on\u000a      reliable mechanisms of data\u000a      collection and the assessment of such data. One of the key outcomes was\u000a      the establishment of the\u000a      world's largest online language archive, Multilingual Manchester. The\u000a      research also highlighted the\u000a      existence of relatively unknown languages such as Kurdish and Romani in\u000a      Manchester. It has also\u000a      helped explain communication patterns among people who speak related\u000a      dialects, such as\u000a      immigrants from different Arabic-speaking countries, and has shed new\u000a      light on the way in which\u000a      people who are multilingual make use of their languages.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Manchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Manchester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007798}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2988507","Name":"Paris"}],"References":"\u000a    (AOR &#8212; Available on Request)\u000a    \u000a3.1 Matras, Yaron. 1998.

The key researcher was Professor\u000a      Yaron Matras (1995-date),\u000a      who has been supported since 1999 by a team of doctoral and post-doctoral\u000a      researchers. The key\u000a      research steps were:\u000a    \u000a      The initial stage involved data collection and analysis in a series of\u000a        multilingual contexts\u000a        mainly in Europe and the Middle East, as well as among immigrant\u000a        communities living in\u000a        Manchester. This led to the development [3.2-3.5] of a theory of\u000a        multilingualism and\u000a        language contact which was published by Matras in 2009 [3.6].\u000a      Further research was launched into language policy in Manchester\u000a        institutions including\u000a        schools, health services and council information leaflets. Matras and\u000a        his team also studied\u000a        the maintenance of heritage languages in families and communities and\u000a        carried out\u000a        analysis of the linguistic landscapes in Manchester. This was then\u000a        expanded to cover\u000a        online multilingualism and the use of multilingual repertoires in social\u000a        media.\u000a      The research developed [3.3, 3.4] an integrated framework &#8212; looking at\u000a        structures [3.7],\u000a        mental processing, and language change through contact &#8212; that views the\u000a        employment of\u000a        multilingual repertoires by individuals and communities as a dynamic and\u000a        creative process\u000a        that is goal- and function-driven [3.8].\u000a    \u000a    Matras found that resources available to communities and an overall\u000a      acceptance of language and\u000a      culture diversity empowers communities to take collective ownership of\u000a      languages [3.6]. This can\u000a      lead to the launch of language-related services that support businesses in\u000a      targeting specific\u000a      audiences [3.6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28117","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context\u000d\u000a    Romani migration from Eastern European countries to the West triggered\u000d\u000a      huge public debate in the\u000d\u000a      early 1990s. Very little research has been carried out into the causes of\u000d\u000a      and patterns of this\u000d\u000a      migration. Professor Matras' work with Romani communities in Greater\u000d\u000a      Manchester has made a\u000d\u000a      direct contribution to policy making at local and European levels by\u000d\u000a      underpinning a new approach\u000d\u000a      to Romani migrants. This approach seeks dialogue and special consideration\u000d\u000a      of their vulnerability\u000d\u000a      as a marginalized minority that is quick to consider migration as a\u000d\u000a      conflict-evasion strategy in the\u000d\u000a      face of stigmatization and social exclusion.\u000d\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000d\u000a    In 1996 Professor Matras was commissioned by the Council of Europe's\u000d\u000a      Population and Migration\u000d\u000a      Division to compile a report and offer policy recommendations arising from\u000d\u000a      his ongoing research\u000d\u000a      into Romani migrations. The report [5.1] was adopted by the European\u000d\u000a      Committee on Migration\u000d\u000a      (CDMG) at its meeting in April 1997 which invited the Secretary General of\u000d\u000a      the Council of Europe\u000d\u000a      to examine its conclusions. The key recommendations were subsequently\u000d\u000a      adopted by the\u000d\u000a      European Committee of Ministers. A further report was commissioned by the\u000d\u000a      Council of Europe in\u000d\u000a      1998, focusing on the immigration of Czech and Slovak Roma to the UK\u000d\u000a      [5.2].\u000d\u000a    Reach and Significance\u000d\u000a    The work has had an impact on European policy. The above reports\u000d\u000a      led to a fundamental\u000d\u000a      change in the discourse on European Romani migrations and provided a\u000d\u000a      cornerstone for the\u000d\u000a      consideration of Roma migrations in policy papers issued by the Council of\u000d\u000a      Europe (for example,\u000d\u000a      the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Right's report from February\u000d\u000a      2012 and the EU's\u000d\u000a      Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) report from 2009). In June 2012, the\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary Assembly\u000d\u000a      of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on `Roma migrants in\u000d\u000a      Europe' in which it\u000d\u000a      directly took up the points first raised in Professor Matras's earlier\u000d\u000a      research outcomes from 1996\u000d\u000a      and 1998 concerning the distinction between `nomads' and `migrants' and\u000d\u000a      the `de facto expulsion'\u000d\u000a      of Roma. The desire to manage the migration of Roma led to an intense\u000d\u000a      discussion process within\u000d\u000a      European institutions, which culminated in the European Commission's call\u000d\u000a      in April 2011 for a\u000d\u000a      European Framework of National Roma Integration Strategies. Professor\u000d\u000a      Matras' reports on Roma\u000d\u000a      migration formed the basis of his keynote speech at the first academic\u000d\u000a      forum devoted to Roma\u000d\u000a      Migrations at Oxford University in January 2008 [3.3]. It was there that\u000d\u000a      the initiative was introduced\u000d\u000a      to establish a new mode of providing academic research input into the\u000d\u000a      policy debate on Roma at a\u000d\u000a      European level. This was directly followed by the creation in 2010 of the\u000d\u000a      European Academic\u000d\u000a      Network on Romani Studies, of which Professor Matras is a founding member\u000d\u000a      and presently an\u000d\u000a      elected member of the Scientific Committee [5.3]. The Network is sponsored\u000d\u000a      by the European\u000d\u000a      Commission and the Council of Europe and its purpose is to advise\u000d\u000a      policymakers on Roma-related\u000d\u000a      research, to increase the visibility of the scientific knowledge available\u000d\u000a      on the European Roma, and\u000d\u000a      improve the planning and implementation of the policies related to Roma on\u000d\u000a      European, national\u000d\u000a      and local levels. Matras's work bridges these levels and is attested to by\u000d\u000a      the Head of Policy\u000d\u000a      Development Unit [5.4].\u000d\u000a    Impact on Romani in Manchester and on community cohesion\u000d\u000a    In 2009 Manchester City Council's Regeneration Team and other community\u000d\u000a      services adopted\u000d\u000a      Professor Matras' recommendations to facilitate targeted training for a\u000d\u000a      group of young Romani\u000d\u000a      immigrants to act as mediators and interpreters for the community of\u000d\u000a      Romanian Romani\u000d\u000a      immigrants in east Manchester [5.5, 5.6]. The report inspired the creation\u000d\u000a      of two positions for\u000d\u000a      Romani outreach workers, funded by Manchester City Council's successful\u000d\u000a      bid to the government's\u000d\u000a      Migrant Impact Fund. It also led to the part-time employment of Romani\u000d\u000a      support workers by\u000d\u000a      Greater Manchester Police, the International New Arrivals Team and two\u000d\u000a      local schools.

He has been supported by a team of research\u000d\u000a      assistants since 2005.\u000d\u000a    Professor Matras has been investigating the impact of post 1990 Romani\u000d\u000a      migration into western\u000d\u000a      Europe and the responses to it by the authorities and media as well as\u000d\u000a      within the Romani political\u000d\u000a      movement. His original research was based on data and observations\u000d\u000a      collected among immigrant\u000d\u000a      Roma and their support groups.\u000d\u000a    His work [3.1-3.4] emphasises the distinction between `nomadism' and\u000d\u000a      `migration' and points to a\u000d\u000a      cluster of features that characterise the migration of Roma:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The first is what he calls `non-confidence and non-identification with\u000d\u000a        their country of\u000d\u000a        residence'. Roma regard themselves, and are perceived by the majority,\u000d\u000a        as strangers who\u000d\u000a        are not the owners of the territory in which they settle. They are more\u000d\u000a        willing to consider the\u000d\u000a        evasion of conflict and hardships through frequent re-location as viable\u000d\u000a        options than\u000d\u000a        members of the settled majority population.\u000d\u000a      Roma migration seldom involves just individuals or nuclear families,\u000d\u000a        but rather extended\u000d\u000a        families and even family networks. This provides Roma migrants with some\u000d\u000a        form of\u000d\u000a        confidence and a tool to endure economic and social hardships. However,\u000d\u000a        Roma generally\u000d\u000a        do not expect to be welcomed in their new country of residence. They are\u000d\u000a        generally\u000d\u000a        prepared to endure more stigmatisation and isolation and to take greater\u000d\u000a        risks such as\u000d\u000a        conflicts with local residents and the law in order to try to establish\u000d\u000a        themselves in a new\u000d\u000a        environment.\u000d\u000a      Finally, views about Roma in the host countries are negatively\u000d\u000a        influenced by century-old\u000d\u000a        stereotypes. This makes Roma especially conspicuous within the landscape\u000d\u000a        of numerous\u000d\u000a        migrant groups that populate Western Europe's urban centres. From this\u000d\u000a        there results a\u000d\u000a        vicious circle of exclusion, criminalisation and marginalisation\u000d\u000a        followed by a greater\u000d\u000a        willingness on the part of the Roma to take risks. However, they also\u000d\u000a        show a greater\u000d\u000a        vulnerability to exploitation.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Research into the motivations and aspirations of Romani immigrants in\u000d\u000a      Manchester was carried\u000d\u000a      out by Professor Matras and his research team in 2009. It remains one of\u000d\u000a      very few attempts to\u000d\u000a      collect first-hand data in Roma migrant communities. His survey [3.5] of\u000d\u000a      some two thirds of all\u000d\u000a      households of a 500-strong community of Roma from South Eastern Romania\u000d\u000a      covered life\u000d\u000a      experiences in Romania, skills, family size, ages, organisation,\u000d\u000a      employment and access to\u000d\u000a      services, motivation to work and relations with neighbours and\u000d\u000a      authorities. As a result of this\u000d\u000a      research an original assessment of the wave of Roma migration following\u000d\u000a      the EU accession of\u000d\u000a      Romania in 2007 was published as a peer-refereed article [3.4].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28118","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context\u000a    The Manchester dance scene has many talented choreographers and there is\u000a      a dedicated body, Dance Initiative Greater Manchester (DiGM: set up\u000a      November 1999), devoted to promoting dance in the area. However Manchester\u000a      has been poorly served for dance relative to comparable cities. When\u000a      members of the Watching Dance research team were invited to lead a\u000a      discussion event at the Green Room following the Turn prize for new\u000a      choreography in March 2011 [5.2], it became apparent that there was a need\u000a      for greater collaboration between choreographers and between\u000a      choreographers and audiences in order to create a truly supportive and\u000a      dynamic environment for dance in the Manchester area and to grow\u000a      audiences. The Manchester Dance Consortium was set up to this end in 2011\u000a      [5.1].\u000a    Pathways to impact\u000a    Since 2011 the Consortium has been working to implement aspects of the\u000a      underpinning research in ways that can benefit the Manchester dance\u000a      community. It was designed to provide support and development for the\u000a      dance scene, and to augment the impact of choreographic practice in\u000a      performance on audiences. Comprising choreographers, dance spectators and\u000a      representatives of dance venues and local bodies, of which the first\u000a      meeting was held in June 2011 [5.1; 5.2], with 25 invited participants\u000a      from different local dance constituencies and led by Reynolds, Joseph Lau\u000a      (choreographer) and Karen Wood (formerly PhD student on the Watching Dance\u000a      project and now postdoctoral lecturer, researcher and choreographer).\u000a      Following the March 2011 Green Room event Reynolds and Wood were\u000a      commissioned to carry out audience research and produce a report on a new\u000a      experimental dance piece by Julia Griffin at Victoria Baths, Manchester\u000a      (April 2012) [5.3]. This fed into the Consortium's approach to the impact\u000a      of its projects on audiences and dancers and into the design of\u000a      questionnaires for subsequent events, and the planning of those events\u000a      (see below).\u000a    The principal beneficiaries of the research are: choreographers, dancers,\u000a      audiences and dance venues who are able to engage through the formal\u000a      infrastructure that the Consortium has set up [5.1]. A Working Party\u000a      includes choreographers (e.g. Fiske, Griffin, Patrick, Platt, Say) along\u000a      with dance audience members and representatives of agencies and venues\u000a      (DiGM, Z-Arts, Contact). This led to a pilot event, Platform Zero [5.5] in\u000a      March 2012. This gave 6 selected artists (performing 3 duets) the\u000a      opportunity to show work in progress and gain feedback. Selection criteria\u000a      included ability to reflect on processes of making and involve audiences\u000a      and the Consortium worked with artists to structure audience\u000a      questionnaires [5.4].\u000a    In October 2012 the Consortium obtained funding (&#163;10,250) from Arts\u000a      Council England to support its activities with a part-time administrator.\u000a      On 29 November 2012 the Consortium held its second performance event,\u000a      Platform 0.1, again supported by partners DiGM and Z-Arts.\u000a    Reach and Significance\u000a    The Platforms are creative collaborations between choreographers and\u000a      audiences. Choreographers present short works in progress and receiving\u000a      written feedback from audiences on their responses. The Consortium's\u000a      webpage brings together the projects activities, enables audience\u000a      collaboration, and acts as a networking portal [5.8].\u000a    At Platform 0.1 the Consortium decided to extend its networks to include\u000a      music artists. This time the selection criteria stipulated a sound\u000a      component (an important aspect of the underpinning research). The Arts\u000a      Council funding enabled the provision of mentoring for participating\u000a      choreographers by a distinguished composer, Alan Williams.\u000a    Platform 0.2 took place on 14 May 2013 at Contact Theatre, Manchester (45\u000a      feedback forms returned). An on-line review noted how ``All three works\u000a      are great demonstrations of the variety and experimentation, which the\u000a      Manchester Dance Consortium encourages' [5.6]. A 3-day Micro-Choreolab was\u000a      held on 4-6 July 2013 (led by professional artists Niku Chaudhari and\u000a      Emilyn Claidand) with the aim of fostering exploration between dance\u000a      artists and musicians of how to enhance performance and optimize impact on\u000a      audiences and their understanding of the interactions of body, movement,\u000a      feeling, and involvement [5.8: MDC Events\/Past MDC Events link]. One\u000a      choreographer remarks on the uniqueness of the Platforms' contribution to\u000a      dance regionally and is benefit for North-based artists generally. A\u000a      reviewer, a regular attender, speaks of Platforms as contributing to 'the\u000a      region's growing and diverse community of dance artists and [giving] dance\u000a      makers [...] a valuable new space for showing their work to interested\u000a      audiences in the city', resisting 'the conservative and commercial mould\u000a      that increasingly characterises regional theatre and dance especially'.\u000a    The impact of this work is on cultural life, generating new ways\u000a      of thinking about dance and watching dance that influence creative\u000a      practice and change audience sensitivities, and inspiring and supporting\u000a      new forms of expression in dance. The reach of the impact activities is\u000a      local and regional through support to the dance community (choreographers,\u000a      dancers, audiences, venues and agencies) in the Manchester area, and\u000a      through attracting and channelling funding. Through creative interactions\u000a      between choreographers and audiences and also between dance artists and\u000a      artists in other media (beginning with sound artists) the Consortium has\u000a      generated a new optimism, openness and dynamism in the Manchester dance\u000a      scene and provided new performing opportunities (and thus employment;\u000a      as also for the part-time administrator) for emerging choreographers, e.g.\u000a      at the three new Platform events. It is artistically and culturally\u000a      significant as it is generating new ways of thinking that\u000a      influence dance and its audiences, who continue to engage with the issues\u000a      between performances through blog entries, comments, and networking\u000a      opportunities [5.7; 5.8, Events\/Networks links].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact is on dancers and audiences in North West England.\u000a      Choreographic practice in live dance performance was found through a\u000a      collaborative research programme to build particular relationships with\u000a      audiences. Where audience feedback influences the choreographic process\u000a      the subsequent effect on how audiences respond to performances is marked.\u000a      Strong links between audiences and dancers can enhance creativity in\u000a      performers, and enrich and expand the imaginations and sensibilities of\u000a      audiences. On the basis of this kind of empathetic relationship, the\u000a      Manchester Dance Consortium has worked to enhance locally the quality of\u000a      dance as a cultural asset and to intensify the involvement and receptivity\u000a      of dance audiences.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Manchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Manchester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007798}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    (AOR - Available on Request)\u000a    Key outputs:\u000a    \u000a3.1.

This was the stimulus for a\u000a      collaborative, research project funded by the AHRC 2008-11, entitled\u000a      `Watching Dance: Kinesthetic Empathy', which used qualitative research and\u000a      neuroscience to study dance audiences. With Reynolds as PI, the\u000a      Co-researchers were: Dr Matthew Reason (York St John University),\u000a      specialising in audience research, and Professor Frank Pollick, Dr\u000a      Marie-Hel&#232;ne Grosbras and Dr Corinne Jola (Glasgow University) together\u000a      with Dr Anna Kuppuswamy (Imperial College London) in neuroscience.\u000a    Reynold's sole-authored work [3.1] was a study of rhythm in the context\u000a      of the work of three choreographers, Mary Wigman, Martha Graham and Merce\u000a      Cunningham. It argued that kinesthesia and kinesthetic empathy are key\u000a      factors in how dance is received and in its capacity to impact on dominant\u000a      economies of rhythm. The collaborative phase of the research then\u000a      investigated how watching dance impacts on spectators, particularly by\u000a      experiencing movement vicariously, even when spectators are not trained\u000a      dancers. It explored the role of this form of empathy in audiences'\u000a      experience of watching dance and their pleasure in watching; it compared\u000a      responses in non-dancers with different experiences of watching dance; and\u000a      it assessed how music and sound affect the experience of watching dance.\u000a    Qualitative research methods were used to assess motor resonance and\u000a      kinaesthetic responses in non-dancer spectators across a range of\u000a      expertise; questionnaires assessed responses to dance, exploring\u000a      spectators' motivations and how they relate to different kinds of\u000a      kinaesthetic empathy; a contemporary dance piece was choreographed by\u000a      Rosie Kay in collaboration with the Watching Dance team, using different\u000a      soundscapes and the performance was followed by focus groups. The filmed\u000a      piece was later shown to spectators while their brains were scanned by\u000a      fMRI imaging to assess which types of sound-movement relation gave rise to\u000a      shared responses between spectators [3.3].\u000a    Visual and creative writing workshops were held following contemporary\u000a      dance performances. Key Findings were reported in an edited book (2012)\u000a      [3.2] as follow:\u000a      &#8226; Experiencing kinesthetic empathy:\u000a      \u000a      relates strongly to previous exposure to specific dance styles, in\u000a        both motor resonance and verbal articulation;\u000a      is a source of pleasure for spectators in watching dance;\u000a      takes more or less embodied or escapist forms, depending on motivation\u000a      can take new forms when spectators respond imaginatively through their\u000a        own creative processes (visual art, creative writing)\u000a    \u000a    The impact of music\/sound varies according to spectators' motivations but\u000a      many spectators react strongly to sounds produced by the dancers\u000a      themselves, especially breathing.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28157","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context\u000d\u000a      Prior to Professor Phillips' visits to the library (from 2003 for the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research and from 2008 for the cataloguing), no on-site\u000d\u000a      expertise was available for precise identification of the archival\u000d\u000a      material. The archive had been donated to the library in two stages with\u000d\u000a      some prior sorting but without any further rigorous classification.\u000d\u000a      Additionally, without the provision of a sophisticated data-base following\u000d\u000a      the wholesale reorganisation of the archive by Phillips, the archive could\u000d\u000a      not have been made meaningfully available to members of the public. Beyond\u000d\u000a      enabling physical access to the archive's contents, the cultural impact of\u000d\u000a      the catalogue lies in its status as a publicly accessible record, in a\u000d\u000a      provincial municipal library, of an aspect of historical memory often\u000d\u000a      underestimated in France &#8212; the visible presence of vibrant Catholic\u000d\u000a      cultural activity in the whole of the country, down to the remotest\u000d\u000a      villages. In this sense, it gives rise to the interpretation and\u000d\u000a      understanding of cultural capital in linking local activity &#8212; particularly\u000d\u000a      in Auxerre and Burgundy &#8212; to grassroots participation in national and\u000d\u000a      international frameworks [5.1].\u000d\u000a    Pathways to impact\u000d\u000a    The research mapped connections between\u000d\u000a      individual, grassroots Catholics in France, theatrical activity, and the\u000d\u000a      construction of a sense of Catholic culture. With Brochet at the centre of\u000d\u000a      this, and the presence of the resource of the fonds, a key step\u000d\u000a      was the design of a means of opening up pubic perspectives on the\u000d\u000a      construction of this culture. Two public lectures on the work were given\u000d\u000a      in 2004 [5.2] and one in 2009. The conceptual organisation of the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research constituted a major factor in the approach to the\u000d\u000a      material in the preparation of the catalogue and it directed the entire\u000d\u000a      physical reordering of material. Phillips's research and scholarly\u000d\u000a      expertise, and his accrued contacts with the library and the community fed\u000d\u000a      directly into the scoping and detailed design of the catalogue as a portal\u000d\u000a      onto this core aspect of French cultural life. In addition, the research\u000d\u000a      undertaken for publication [3.3] allowed for informed classification of\u000d\u000a      material outside France connected to Brochet.\u000d\u000a    A major benefit to users of the material is a highly organised and\u000d\u000a      informed level of accessibility. This is enhanced by the nature of the\u000d\u000a      catalogue which is constructed according to a fully searchable data-base\u000d\u000a      with the material connected via a wide variety of links according to\u000d\u000a      person, text, nature of object, date, author, troupe and other rubrics.\u000d\u000a      The catalogue's immediate material impact lies thus in its dynamic form, a\u000d\u000a      great rarity in the world of local, even national, French archives. As few\u000d\u000a      as four key words allow the whole archive (106 boxes of material) to be\u000d\u000a      navigated [5.3 catalogue tab]. No extensive academic knowledge is\u000d\u000a      therefore required. As the Librarian responsible for Departmental Archives\u000d\u000a      attests, one early reader \"was delighted to find quickly what he\/she was\u000d\u000a      looking for, and [noted] that there were a large number of things ready\u000d\u000a      for further exploitation\" [5.4].\u000d\u000a    Details and types of impact\u000d\u000a      The impact on members of the public accessing the catalogue through the\u000d\u000a      library's web site [5.3: link tab], or on-site, falls squarely in the\u000d\u000a      domain of preserving, conserving and presenting cultural heritage\u000d\u000a      in a local, national and international context. Readers in the local\u000d\u000a      community are able to discover aspects of their municipal and regional\u000d\u000a      culture through access to the activities and writings of Brochet and those\u000d\u000a      around him, while the scope and significance is enhanced through networked\u000d\u000a      availability and easy visualisation. An important aspect of the catalogue\u000d\u000a      as an act of conservation is the provision of illustrations of maquettes\u000d\u000a      and posters (a complete photographic record of the latter compiled by\u000d\u000a      Phillips obviates the need for physical contact with often very fragile\u000d\u000a      objects).\u000d\u000a    The archive has been made usable by amateur and professional researchers:\u000d\u000a      in the words of the Head Librarian at Auxerre, the catalogued archive \"has\u000d\u000a      become a point of reference for all those interested in this particular\u000d\u000a      domain and several researchers have already consulted the archive in\u000d\u000a        situ\" as well, more extensively, as on-line [5.1; also 5.2].\u000d\u000a      However, the importance of the archive lies precisely in its status as a\u000d\u000a      publicly accessible witness to local and national cultural activity of\u000d\u000a      importance to the community. It opens up knowledge of the work and person\u000d\u000a      of Brochet as, in the words of the Deputy Mayor, a local and regional\u000d\u000a      presence of significance to \"local heritage\" [5.2]; and it has impact on a\u000d\u000a      wider interested audience, accessing the catalogue off-site [5.3] in the\u000d\u000a      context of a clear underpinning contribution from the University of\u000d\u000a      Manchester, with access to Phillips's work highlighted for users [5.5].\u000d\u000a    The impact relates to tourism and heritage in the local and\u000d\u000a      regional economy as well as to cultural memory. Henri Brochet was based in\u000d\u000a      Auxerre from 1933 to his death and his house served as a reminder of the\u000d\u000a      family's artistic heritage &#8212; through exhibitions (also accessed through\u000d\u000a      the catalogue pages) of his painter\/sculptor son Fran&#231;ois and of other\u000d\u000a      Burgundian cultural figures -- until 2013, and thereafter by the\u000d\u000a      commemorative plaque (part of a wider of public memorialisation of this\u000d\u000a      family in the city). Part of the the private collections of Fran&#231;ois\u000d\u000a      Brochet is in process of being moved to V&#233;zelay (an important focus of\u000d\u000a      tourism, especially for its positioning on the Camino de Santiago) for\u000d\u000a      exhibition and archiving. The Head Librarian at Auxerre [5.1] confirms the\u000d\u000a      significance and attraction of the archive itself, thus contextualised.\u000d\u000a    The catalogue reflects a distinctive feature of the underpinning research\u000d\u000a      represented in [3.1), by expanding historical imagination and awareness\u000d\u000a      through attention to Catholic theatre culture. An unusual picture emerges\u000d\u000a      of the Third Republic in a provincial public institution belonging to a\u000d\u000a      continuing but at the same time changing cultural landscape, thus heavily\u000d\u000a      nuancing or even challenging the dominant narrative of modern French\u000d\u000a      history and making a powerful contribution to public education.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The product of the underpinning research is a dynamically searchable,\u000d\u000a      on-line catalogue of the archives of theatrical producer, critic and\u000d\u000a      cultural promoter Henri Brochet (1898-1952). Preservation and\u000d\u000a      interpretation of historical memory is a major part of the impact, which\u000d\u000a      comes from the discovery of an aspect of grassroots Catholic activity in\u000d\u000a      France.

The first journal article [3.2)\u000d\u000a      laid the ground for the investigation into correspondence between cultural\u000d\u000a      promoters and the book Le Th&#233;&#226;tre catholique en France au XXe si&#232;cle\u000d\u000a      [3.1], is a full-scale treatment of the questions around the significance\u000d\u000a      of theatre in Catholic French life, leading to impacts on civic and\u000d\u000a      cultural life. The key researcher was Professor Henry Phillips (1995-date)\u000d\u000a      assisted by two research associates, Aude Pichon (2001-3) and Louis-\u000d\u000a      Georges Tin (2004-5).\u000d\u000a    The research aimed to explore the unprecedented collaboration between the\u000d\u000a      French Catholic Church as an institution and a variety of individual\u000d\u000a      Catholics and Catholic organisations. This collaboration came after\u000d\u000a      centuries of religious hostility to, and suspicion of, theatre. The\u000d\u000a      organisations were aspiring to produce forms of public theatre which would\u000d\u000a      be both acceptable to a believing public and would demonstrate the\u000d\u000a      existence of a serious Catholic culture in the perceived context of a\u000d\u000a      dechristianised France. An investigation of this scale had never\u000d\u000a      previously been attempted, or the subject seriously considered in\u000d\u000a      scientific terms.\u000d\u000a    The initial stages of the research involved identifying relevant archival\u000d\u000a      material and other sources, in most cases little known or undiscovered,\u000d\u000a      including correspondence [3.2], some of this held in the fonds Brochet.\u000d\u000a      The research, once completed, resulted in the monograph [3.1] and articles\u000d\u000a      in British, French and Canadian journals (including [3.3] and [3.4]).\u000d\u000a    The research demonstrated the degree to which the French Catholic theatre\u000d\u000a      movement counted not only on the support of major theatrical figures but\u000d\u000a      also on the active collaboration of members of the clergy, including major\u000d\u000a      episcopal figures. A key finding was the existence of a vibrant amateur\u000d\u000a      theatrical culture at the level of diocese and parish throughout France,\u000d\u000a      organised nationally by a legally constituted association with its journal\u000d\u000a      and elected officials. Within this context, the research also highlighted\u000d\u000a      the major contribution over 30 years from 1922-1952 of Henri Brochet,\u000d\u000a      especially his theatrical and personal collaboration with playwright and\u000d\u000a      critic Henri Gh&#233;on, which aspired to produce a performable repertoire for\u000d\u000a      professionals but especially for amateur troupes in cities and in the\u000d\u000a      remotest corners of France.\u000d\u000a    From 1933, Brochet was located in Auxerre where he produced a journal, Jeux,\u000a        tr&#233;teaux et personnages, until his death in 1952. He led a troupe in\u000d\u000a      his Paris years, which he later supported from Auxerre, the `Compagnons de\u000d\u000a      Jeux'. This amateur troupe toured throughout France, but also in Belgium,\u000d\u000a      the Low Countries and Spain. Brochet and Gh&#233;on were intimately connected\u000d\u000a      with major Canadian and Belgian figures in the Catholic theatre movement,\u000d\u000a      and both corresponded frequently with amateur practitioners throughout\u000d\u000a      France and abroad. Professor Phillips' published work in this area as a\u000d\u000a      whole concentrates on France in particular but also on Gh&#233;on's and\u000d\u000a      Brochet's international undertakings, as well as Brochet's wider network.\u000d\u000a      One major contribution of the research is to offer a picture of Catholic\u000d\u000a      presence and visibility in a Third Republic with a determined laicising\u000d\u000a      agenda.\u000d\u000a    A British Academy research grant [3.5] to develop this work in a\u000d\u000a      specifically designed catalogue represents the final bridge between the\u000d\u000a      research work of the early-to mid-2000s and the subsequent impact.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30234","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The project was conceived and delivered with the intention to reach and\u000a      to influence the wider\u000a      public.

Collaboration\u000a      with the Estorick was\u000a      crucial. The director Roberta Cremoncini and staff member Christopher\u000a      Adams co-curated the\u000a      exhibition with Pieri, Gundle and Storchi of the project team. The\u000a      Estorick itself also contributed\u000a      &#163;34,000 to the &#163;45,000 cost of the exhibition, which brought numerous\u000a      works by major artists\u000a      (Guttuso, Mafai, Maccari etc) to London, together with lesser known works\u000a      discovered by the\u000a      project team (from, among others, the Tono Zancanaro archive in Padua, The\u000a      Enrico Sturani\u000a      Collection in Rome, and the Wolfson Collection in Genoa).\u000a    The exhibition was widely reviewed, especially in the Italian press.

These talks offer clear and informative\u000a      analysis for a non-specialist\u000a      audience. They focus on art works brought to London for the exhibition\u000a      which were produced\u000a      during the Fascist era, and emphasise the decline of the cult in the years\u000a      immediately following\u000a      Mussolini's fall from power in 1943, when there was widespread destruction\u000a      of Fascist symbols\u000a      and images of Mussolini. Pieri's research on the official iconography of\u000a      the regime and the\u000a      multifaceted representations of Mussolini underpinned the analysis and put\u000a      into context the\u000a      ridiculing of Mussolini in the works and their condemnation of the\u000a      violence and brutality of the\u000a      regime.\u000a    Documentary films:\u000a    The research has led to the creation of teaching resources (3 documentary\u000a      films) which have\u000a      improved the quality of the learning experience in HE and FE-level\u000a      education around the world for\u000a      students learning about European History and Fascism. The three\u000a      documentaries the project\u000a      delivered received public screenings (University College London, 11\u000a      February 2011) and in\u000a      Mussolini's home town of Predappio (25 February 2011; but note that the\u000a      films are designed for\u000a      use as DVDs in schools as educational resources). There was extensive\u000a      newspaper coverage of\u000a      the Predappio event, reflecting one of its intended functions as a means\u000a      of engaging with and\u000a      challenging Italian audiences and making a contribution to the process of\u000a      memorialisation and\u000a      reconciliation.

It was conducted with\u000a      co-investigators Prof.\u000a      C. Duggan (Reading) and Prof. S. Gundle (Warwick) and a team of\u000a      postdoctoral research\u000a      assistants (Simona Storchi, Sofia Serenelli, Vanessa Roghi and Paola\u000a      Bernasconi) and PhD\u000a      students (Alessandra Antola and Eugene Pooley) as part of the AHRC-funded\u000a      research project\u000a      The Cult of the Duce: Mussolini and the Italians 1918-2005. The\u000a      focus on Mussolini has proven\u000a      illuminating to a non-academic audience curious about the relationship\u000a      between politics, society\u000a      and culture. Pieri's contribution to the project focused on aesthetics and\u000a      the visual components of\u000a      the cult, especially the fine arts (painting and sculpture). Using little\u000a      known material drawn from\u000a      private collections and archives Pieri was able to show that seemingly\u000a      contrasting iconographic\u000a      references, encompassing Classical, Renaissance, Modernist and Avant-Garde\u000a      models, were in\u000a      fact used to highlight facets of Mussolini's public persona. Images of\u000a      Mussolini, whether in\u000a      propaganda or works by prominent artists, embraced the principle of\u000a      `organised confusion' &#8212; an\u000a      approach which gave a misleading sense of stylistic freedom in the art\u000a      produced in Fascist Italy.\u000a    Two major outputs of the project were especially informed by Pieri's\u000a      research (and also achieved\u000a      impact): Pieri's co-curation of an exhibition, and a series of documentary\u000a      films exploring aspects\u000a      of the cult of the Duce both during and after Fascism, a hitherto\u000a      underexplored field. Pieri's work\u000a      revealed the mechanisms that allowed the creation and development of the\u000a      official iconography\u000a      of Mussolini, and generated new interpretations of the reception of images\u000a      of the Duce in the\u000a      postwar period, and of the role of the arts in the fall of the\u000a      dictatorship. The exhibition `Against\u000a      Mussolini: Art and the Fall of a Dictator', which has a permanent online\u000a      presence at\u000a      www.mussolinicult.com, was\u000a      held at the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art in London, one\u000a      of the most significant venues for modern Italian art outside Italy, and\u000a      was jointly curated with the\u000a      Estorick's curatorial team. The organisation of the exhibition and the\u000a      selection of material to be\u000a      exhibited, for which Pieri wrote the accompanying labels and notes, and\u000a      which included many\u000a      works previously unseen in public and never before seen in the UK, arose\u000a      directly out of Pieri's\u000a      research in the project. The focus on the role of the Fine Arts is an area\u000a      which has hitherto been\u000a      marginalized in studies of Fascist and Anti-Fascist propaganda.\u000a    Pieri's contributions to the volume The Cult of the Duce and two\u000a      of the three documentary films\u000a      produced for the project (Fascism and the Cult of the Duce; and Mussolini\u000a        after Mussolini), both\u000a      featuring interviews with Pieri, offer new insights into two key,\u000a      understudied areas in the personality\u000a      cult of Mussolini: the iconography of Mussolini, which is more complex and\u000a      nuanced than\u000a      previously thought, and the postwar cult of Mussolini. which cast new\u000a      light on the way in which\u000a      ideological discourses in the postwar period influenced the critical and\u000a      public reception of\u000a      Mussolini's image.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30235","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Professor Longerich is co-chair (together with Dr. Juliane Wetzel, TU\u000a      Berlin) of the Unabh&#228;ngiger\u000a      Expertenkreis Antisemitismus (Independent Expert Committee on\u000a      Anti-Semitism), commisioned by\u000a      the German Parliament in 2008 to coincide with the 70th anniversary of Kristallnacht.\u000a      The\u000a      Committee was commissioned to produce an unprecedented, detailed account\u000a      of the extent,\u000a      nature and effects of anti-Semitism in German society today, and to advise\u000a      on possible strategies\u000a      for combating it and for further promoting Jewish life in Germany. This\u000a      report (more than 200\u000a      pages in length) was completed in October 2011 and discussed at a cabinet\u000a      meeting of the\u000a      German government on 2 November 2011. It was presented and recommended to\u000a      the German\u000a      Parliament (Bundestag) on 23 January 2012. Its findings include the claim\u000a      that `latently' anti-\u000a      Semitic attitudes, discernible in different ways in as much as 20% of the\u000a      German population,\u000a      remain deeply ingrained in mainstream German society. The report argues\u000a      that previous strategies\u000a      have failed in part because they lacked co-ordination and a clear\u000a      understanding of what constitutes\u000a      `anti-Semitism' and recommends that a co-ordinated strategy for dealing\u000a      with anti-Semitism be\u000a      introduced and put into practice across a spectrum of social strata,\u000a      including the justice system, the\u000a      police, the education system, politics, and sport. It was the subject of a\u000a      full parliamentary debate on\u000a      17 October 2012. The report includes at its conclusion a detailed account\u000a      of suggested measures\u000a      to prevent anti-Semitism, a number of which, in areas such as education\u000a      and sport, are now being\u000a      acted upon. In this way Longerich's body of research, which demonstrates\u000a      the ways in which an\u000a      ideological position such as anti-Semitism, if left unchallenged, can come\u000a      to exercise a malign\u000a      influence, often indirectly, throughout a society, has led to a very\u000a      concrete impact on a crucial area\u000a      of policy making and on civil society in one of Europe's major nations.\u000a    Longerich has acted as an external advisor (member of the\u000a      Wissenschaftlicher Beirat) to the City\u000a      of Munich in the planning of a `Document Centre on Nazism in Munich'.\u000a      Longerich's work on\u000a      National Socialism is underpinned by his particular expertise in the\u000a      administrative documents that\u000a      the Nazis were often meticulous about. A particular achievement of his\u000a      authoritative studies of the\u000a      subject, evident in their bibliographies, has been their use of relevant\u000a      primary sources that are\u000a      often scattered widely across Europe and the USA, and held in many\u000a      different public and private\u000a      collections. He has thus been very well placed to advise on the design\u000a      concept of a major, publicly\u000a      funded, specialised archival resource in Germany. The Centre is currently\u000a      being built by the City, to\u000a      the recommendations made by Longerich and his fellow advisors, in\u000a      conjunction with the State of\u000a      Bavaria und the Federal Republic of Germany, and is scheduled to open in\u000a      2014. The finalized\u000a      plan to which Longerich and the advisory team have contributed is binding\u000a      for the work of the\u000a      Centre, which will include a permanent exhibition, learning facilities and\u000a      a pedagogical service.\u000a    This is an example of Longerich's body of research leading to an impact\u000a      on the commissioning,\u000a      design and realisation of a major educational project designed to improve\u000a      the wider public's\u000a      understanding of historical and political issues.\u000a    Longerich's major publications have been translated into several\u000a      languages and have been very\u000a      widely reviewed in popular (non-academic) media around the world. In the\u000a      German-speaking\u000a      world, his publications have prompted major features in high-circulation\u000a      publication such as Die\u000a        Zeit and Der Spiegel. This degree of public awareness of his\u000a      research forms the basis for his\u000a      frequent invitations to comment on matters relating to history and\u000a      society, to deliver public lectures,\u000a      to appear on radio and television programmes, to act in advisory roles for\u000a      television\u000a      documentaries, and to give interviews in newspapers and other public\u000a      contributions. These\u000a      activities amount to a significant form of cultural impact. An example of\u000a      this type of activity saw\u000a      Longerich as an invited keynote speaker, alongside the European Commissar\u000a      for Science and\u000a      Israel's Minister for Education, at the launch of the EHRI project\u000a      (European Holocaust Research\u000a      Institutes Network), November 2010. The event was attended and reported on\u000a      by representatives\u000a      of the European news media.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Through his research on Nazi Germany and on the causes of the Holocaust\u000a      Professor Peter\u000a      Longerich has made a substantial contribution to CULTURE and to PUBLIC\u000a      DISCOURSE\u000a      internationally. He addresses globally important and controversial\u000a      questions, including the\u000a      relationship between anti-Semitism and the commission of mass murder, and\u000a      the degree of\u000a      responsibility born by Germany as a nation for the Holocaust. His work has\u000a      been debated in high\u000a      profile media forums, such as Der Spiegel and Die Zeit.\u000a    Longerich's research has also led to impacts on both CIVIL SOCIETY and\u000a      POLICY MAKING in\u000a      Germany, for example through his appointment as the chair of the\u000a      Independent Expert Committee\u000a      on Anti-Semitism, an advisory group established by the German government,\u000a      and on\u000a      EDUCATION: in 2011 he was commissioned to help design a public `document\u000a      centre' focused on\u000a      the history of National Socialism in Munich.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Royal Holloway, University of London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Royal Holloway, University of London","InstitutionName":"Royal Holloway, University of London","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"London","UKPRN":10005553}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2950159","Name":"Berlin"},{"GeoNamesId":"2867714","Name":"München"},{"GeoNamesId":"2867714","Name":"Munich"},{"GeoNamesId":"2951839","Name":"Bavaria"}],"References":"\u000a    Key Single-authored monographs by Longerich:\u000a    \u000a1.

He was appointed as a\u000a      member of academic staff\u000a      in Royal Holloway's German Department, now part of the School of Modern\u000a      Languages,\u000a      Literatures and Cultures, in 1993. His research focus on the history of\u000a      National Socialism and the\u000a      Holocaust is of unique importance, and the significance of his work is\u000a      acknowledged both by\u000a      historians and the wider public in Europe and beyond. His research is\u000a      distinguished through a\u000a      particular depth of knowledge, evident in the evaluation of an\u000a      extraordinary range of primary\u000a      sources, and through Longerich's ability to synthesize these into a highly\u000a      readable form, with\u000a      clearly drawn and often provocative conclusions. His landmark study Politik\u000a        der Vernichtung\u000a      (1998), now comprehensively revised in an English edition (Holocaust\u000a      (2010)), attempts to do\u000a      justice to a complex phenomenon and challenge simplifications, for example\u000a      the assumption that\u000a      the Holocaust was an inevitability once the Nazis had attained power and\u000a      the expectation that a\u000a      definitive single `moment', in which Hitler's genocidal `final solution'\u000a      was decided upon, could and\u000a      should be identified by historians. His most recent work, such as his\u000a      biographical studies Himmler\u000a      (2008) and Goebbels (2010), has further developed this approach,\u000a      making extensive use of little-\u000a      known primary sources, such as the minutes recorded at the daily meetings\u000a      of high-ranking\u000a      officials, the documentation held by the numerous offices of the Nazi\u000a      Party, reports from\u000a      contemporary media, letters and diaries.\u000a    Longerich's work offers a consistent and persuasive line of argument in\u000a      which anti-Semitism is\u000a      interpreted as an ideology that was of central, underpinning importance to\u000a      National Socialism, and\u000a      which was fundamental to the formation and delivery of politics and policy\u000a      (Politik) under Hitler,\u000a      including the decision to go to war, the attempt to drive Germany (and the\u000a      spurious notion of\u000a      `Germandom' (Deutschtum)) eastwards, and the eventual emergence of\u000a      a practice of mass-murder\u000a      as a `solution' to the `problem' of a Jewish population for which there\u000a      was no place in the `utopian'\u000a      vision of a future German empire. The range of issues explored in his\u000a      work, which also relates to\u000a      questions of `guilt', complicity and knowledge, and national identity,\u000a      themes that are most directly\u000a      addressed in his `Davon haben wir nichts gewu&#223;t' (2006), is of\u000a      ongoing and vital relevance in an\u000a      age of continued social tensions and political conflict. Longerich's\u000a      wide-ranging and prolific\u000a      scholarship has produced a body of research that has addressed all of\u000a      these and more,\u000a      meticulously and in depth. It is original both in its uncovering of\u000a      uncomfortable truths relating to\u000a      forms of collective guilt and responsibility, and in the precision of its\u000a      scrutiny of the lives,\u000a      personalities and careers of high-ranking Nazis such as Himmler and\u000a      Goebbels, the historical\u000a      reality of whom has sometimes become obscured by their notoriety and by\u000a      myths.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30236","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research is a collaborative project which from the outset has\u000a      involved the British Library. In so doing it makes a contribution to the\u000a      areas in which the Library is a leading institution: CULTURAL LIFE,\u000a      EDUCATION, CIVIL SOCIETY. The aim of the British Library Themed\u000a      Collections series is to open up underused parts of the collections to\u000a      readers by enhancing the information available. In this case, this was\u000a      achieved through the creation of a special subset or database relating to\u000a      that material (a first version went live in 2007 and has been in\u000a      development since that date). The Italian Academies database is easily\u000a      accessible from the main, Integrated Catalogue. The database is located on\u000a      the BL server and is thus accessible to all users both within the BL and\u000a      externally, and can also be accessed online by those who are not\u000a      registered readers of the BL. The interface has been configured for ease\u000a      of use by all readers\/users, including the visually impaired.\u000a    The software model designed by the project team in conjunction with the\u000a      BL IT department (eIS) has subsequently, in a very welcome impact that was\u000a      unforeseen in the planning stages of the project, influenced the revisions\u000a      of other catalogues. BL staff involved in the replacement of the on- line\u000a      catalogue of western manuscripts chose the Themed Collections architecture\u000a      for the new catalogue system. The Head of Manuscripts (BL) comments: `One\u000a      particularly successful example [of Themed Collections] was the Italian\u000a      Academies Project. We noted how it was possible to customise fields to\u000a      hold the required data elements [...], to create links and structure the\u000a      data to make provision for simple and advanced searches. Through their\u000a      experience of working on the system in partnership and gaining external\u000a      validation, our in-house experts were well able to support our\u000a      requirements and deliver value for money.' The Italian Academies project\u000a      has therefore made a clear contribution to informing expert systems for\u000a      enhanced library on-line cataloguing and to improving the methods used\u000a      within a profession.\u000a    Beneficiaries therefore not only include scholars in a wide range of\u000a      disciplines working on early modern European history and culture but also\u000a      include British Library staff in collections and in systems, as well as\u000a      readers and members of the general public with similar interests, in the\u000a      UK, Italy, the USA and more widely. The database reveals the extensive\u000a      intellectual networks of the period and plays a role in the development of\u000a      an understanding of European cultural heritage. The impact on public\u000a      discourse has been on-going since the publication of the first stages of\u000a      the database in 2007. Through presentations in the UK and Italy to members\u000a      of the general public there has been a significant effect on the awareness\u000a      and understanding not only of the Italian Academies and their achievements\u000a      but of the idea of intellectual and social networks more generally, a\u000a      theme that is of continued interest and relevance to audiences in today's\u000a      digital age. The parallels the team has drawn with Facebook and other\u000a      forms of social networks have caught the public's attention, evident in\u000a      responses to presentations and in press articles in several countries,\u000a      including Italy and Brazil.\u000a    A series of public events has helped to engage with users and with the\u000a      wider public since the project launch as an event (attended by ca. 80\u000a      people) at the British Library in January 2009. A number of BL staff and\u000a      readers attended the major project conference held at the BL in September\u000a      2012. Subsequently the lectures and papers delivered have been made\u000a      available via podcast on the project webpages (www.italianacademies.org).\u000a      In December 2012 the database was presented to a BL `Bite Size' seminar\u000a      attended by BL staff, designed to brief them on the interlinks between\u000a      fields in the database, the incorporation of digitised images, and the\u000a      structure and navigation of the database. On feedback forms for the event\u000a      those attending emphasised that the presentation would enhance their use\u000a      of the database. One commented: `I think it is a fabulous database and\u000a      excellent worthwhile work'.\u000a    In Spring 2012 Professor Everson presented the project in Latina\u000a      (southern Italy) to an audience which included some 60+ school children\u000a      and their teachers, and in January 2013 Dr Testa presented to 50 secondary\u000a      school pupils in Bologna; feedback collected reflects clear enthusiasm for\u000a      and interest in the visual and networking dimensions of the database. The\u000a      reactions of the Italian school students again highlight the attraction to\u000a      the general public of the parallels with modern social media.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The AHRC-funded research project `The Italian Academies 1525-1700' (phase\u000a      1 (2006-09): 'A Themed Collection Database', and phase 2 (2010-): `The\u000a      First Intellectual Networks of Early Modern Europe') under the direction\u000a      of principal investigator Professor Jane Everson (Royal Holloway) has\u000a      established a significant public resource on the Italian Academies.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Italian\u000a      Academies were responsible for promoting debate and discussion in a range\u000a      of disciplines, from language and literature, through the visual and\u000a      performing arts, to science, technology, medicine and astronomy &#8212; yet\u000a      scholars have often struggled to attain a real overview of the complex\u000a      networks of relations that were central to the way in which the Academies\u000a      functioned. The collaborative research project `The Italian Academies\u000a      1525-1700' has addressed this problem and has pioneered the comparative\u000a      and critical study of the Academies using innovative scholarly and\u000a      technological methods.\u000a    a.

The\u000a      findings in the report were supported by a practitioner survey and an\u000a      academic conference, and\u000a      were based in part on Fenoulhet's earlier study of the development of\u000a      Dutch Studies.\u000a    The report resulting from that commission was generated specifically to\u000a      provide policy advice to\u000a      the Netherlands' Committee of Ministers, which oversees the work of the\u000a      Dutch Language Union.\u000a      Through this report the RNTL, which sets the DLU's policy direction,\u000a      sought to revitalise a\u000a      discipline which was increasingly seen by its practitioners as divided and\u000a      stagnating, and\u000a      especially to redress the disjuncture between intra muros (that\u000a      is, `home countries') practitioners,\u000a      regarded as occupying the centre of the disciplinary field, and those extra\u000a        muros: practitioners\u000a      operating in its periphery. Publications arising from the research\u000a      described in section 2 had, in fact,\u000a      already emphasised the importance of supporting two-way academic exchange\u000a      between intra and\u000a      extra muros practitioners, and suggested pathways to achieve this.\u000a      Fenoulhet et al's\u000a      recommendations for a move to an international or transnational\u000a      (rather than a merely\u000a      national[istic]) approach within Dutch Studies &#8212; as well as for the steps\u000a      required to effect this &#8212;\u000a      were incorporated wholeheartedly into the RNTL policy advice document Naar\u000a        een internationale\u000a        en interdisciplinaire neerlandistiek, published in March 2009 [2]\u000a      and submitted to the Flemish\u000a      Minister for Culture, Youth and Sport [3].\u000a    This document prompted a paradigm shift in the field of Dutch Studies,\u000a      notably the International\u000a      Association for Dutch Studies, a key channel for the distribution of\u000a      funding from the DLU and\u000a      crucial player in catalysing change in Higher Education teaching and\u000a      research. The\u000a      recommendations to which Fenoulhet's work contributed enabled the DLU to\u000a      instigate long-desired\u000a      change in the field. The DLU has subsequently integrated these\u000a      recommendations into policies\u000a      and work plans.\u000a    Policy reorientation at the DLU\u000a    Policy recommendations in the RNTL document linked to Fenoulhet's\u000a      research include: [2]\u000a    - Stimulating international cooperation and developing joint curricula\u000a      (3.1.1)\u000a    - Reducing administrative obstructions to cooperation between\u000a      universities (3.1.2)\u000a    - Furthering international collaboration in teaching (3.1.3)\u000a    - Supporting the research community outside Netherlands and Belgium\u000a      (3.2.1)\u000a    - Supporting journals of international Dutch studies (3.2.2)\u000a    - Supporting joint PhD supervision (3.2.3)\u000a    - Encouraging\/ supporting opportunities for public and international\u000a      research (3.2.4)\u000a    The extent of the DLU's policy reorientation relating to its definition\u000a      and promotion of Dutch Studies\u000a      was demonstrated by its new efforts to support debate and dialogue, on an\u000a      equal footing, between\u000a      practitioners intra and extra muros. The RNTL policy\u000a      advice document was launched by the Chair\u000a      of the RNTL and the Director-General of the DLU in August 2009 at the\u000a      University of Utrecht, at the\u000a      17th conference of the International Association of Dutch Studies, a body\u000a      part-funded by the DLU,\u000a      which supports Dutch Studies teaching around the world. Following\u000a      recommendation 3.2.4, and in\u000a      recognition of its importance for the direction of the discipline as a\u000a      whole, the Association devoted\u000a      to it a special issue of its journal Internationale neerlandistiek\u000a      (`International Dutch Studies'),\u000a      formerly known as the Neerlandica extra muros (the journal for\u000a      `outsiders'; renamed 2008) [4],\u000a      funded by the DLU.\u000a    Furthermore, Fenoulhet and the chair of the Association selected key\u000a      papers from the 2009\u000a      conference which represented the multidisciplinary way forward for Dutch\u000a      Studies. These formed\u000a      the first volume in a new series entitled Lage Landen Studies (Low\u000a      Countries Studies), intended to\u000a      provide publication opportunities for researchers practising the new\u000a      transnational discipline.\u000a      Volume 1, edited by Fenoulhet and Renkema, bears the programmatic title Internationale\u000aneerlandistiek:\u000a        een vak in beweging (International Dutch Studies: a discipline on\u000a      the move [e]). By\u000a      2013, six volumes had been published, demonstrating the lively response\u000a      from the field. [4]\u000a    Changes in policy on the support and practice of Dutch Studies\u000a    The DLU's reorientation led to several specific changes in the ways in\u000a      which Dutch Studies are\u000a      funded and designed. In 2010, Fenoulhet was appointed as the only\u000a      international academic\u000a      advisor to the 12-member RNTL policy advice body, with a watching brief\u000a      covering Dutch Studies\u000a      as a worldwide academic subject [5]. Many of the recommendations she has\u000a      made both in her\u000a      research outputs and within that forum are reflected in subsequent\u000a      decisions taken by the RNTL,\u000a      including in its new five year plan (2012) advising on priorities for the\u000a      allocation of its budget of &#8364;60\u000a      million during 2013-17 [5]. Thus, for example, despite budgetary cuts\u000a      prompted by the financial\u000a      crisis the plan includes, as a key innovation, the provision of funding\u000a      for digital access, a priority\u000a      which reflects recommendation 3.2.1 that the needs of professionals\u000a      outside the Dutch language\u000a      area be supported through the provision of an excellent digital\u000a      infrastructure. In 2012, for example,\u000a      the DBNL was (the digital library of Dutch literature, an important\u000a      resource for Dutch Studies\u000a      worldwide) granted &#8364;[text removed for publication] in the DLU budget [6].\u000a    The current five-year plan also give a high priority to support for\u000a      literary translation through support\u000a      for the expansion of a new bi-national Masters in Literary Translation at\u000a      the Universities of Utrecht\u000a      and Leuven, to be launched in September 2013, and to include the\u000a      participation of Dutch Studies\u000a      outside the language area [10]. UCL and the University of M&#252;nster were\u000a      proposed as initial\u000a      international partners. International meetings to discuss these\u000a      developments were funded by the\u000a      DLU via the Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen (Centre of Expertise in\u000a      Literary Translation) [5, p.\u000a      58-9] from 2012.\u000a    Following the revision to its approach to the promotion of Dutch Studies\u000a      in 2010 [7], the DLU made\u000a      available funding opportunities according to the needs of international\u000a      Dutch Studies. Support to\u000a      encourage contacts between researchers inside and outside the language\u000a      area was developed, for\u000a      instance, a fund to enable research visits to the Netherlands or Flanders\u000a      of up to 6 months to fulfil\u000a      the objectives of supporting young researchers, promoting Dutch Studies\u000a      and contribute to its\u000a      independence internationally, and promote accredited departments [7].\u000a    Changes in how Dutch Studies is practised\u000a    The DLU's change in orientation led to support for new forums where\u000a      practitioners from around the\u000a      word could engage in dialogue, on an equal footing regarding the future of\u000a      their field. The open\u000a      discussions facilitated by these forums are also a pathway for broader\u000a      change within the discipline,\u000a      prompting a move towards collaboration for which the report proposed\u000a      channels and the DLU's\u000a      changed priorities provide material support [11]. See, for example the\u000a      digital platforms hosted by\u000a      the International Association for Dutch Studies: in particular, the\u000a      platform on Internationale\u000a      Historische Neerlandistiek which hosted informal international debate\u000a      among colleagues and\u000a      ultimately gave rise to volume 6 in the Lage Landen Studies\u000a      series, Beatrijs de wereld in, a study\u000a      of translations of the medieval Dutch text in several European languages\u000a      [11].\u000a    In 2010, the University of Amsterdam launched the peer-reviewed\u000a      English-language Journal of\u000a        Dutch Literature, in line with recommendation 3.2.2. As its website\u000a      states: `With its methodological\u000a      and frequently interdisciplinary approach, the journal places Dutch\u000a      literature in an international\u000a      context, treating literary phenomena against the broader perspective of\u000a      international literary\u000a      research' [8], an approach that accords entirely with Fenoulhet's research\u000a      and policy\u000a      recommendations. Similarly, an international interdisciplinary conference\u000a      (the 18de Colloquium\u000a      Neerlandicum) held at the University of Antwerp in August 2012 with\u000a      funding from the DLU [9]\u000a      aimed to stimulate relevant changes in teaching. The conference included a\u000a      programme of\u000a      facilitated discussion on the nature of the Dutch Studies curriculum at\u000a      universities around the\u000a      world, and its future shape to ensure the internationalisation of the\u000a      material taught as well as transnational co-operation between universities [9].\u000a    There have been significant changes since 2009 in the extent of and\u000a      significance attached to\u000a      translation studies. Previously frequently considered peripheral to Dutch\u000a      Studies, its role in\u000a      intercultural exchange is now accepted, as is the role of departments\u000a      outside the language area\u000a      which are now seen as capable of producing good translators. In the\u000a      current 5-year plan [5 p58-9],\u000a      literary translation is identified as a site of dynamic exchange which\u000a      strengthens the study of a\u000a      language and culture. Since the publication of that report:\u000a    - In 2012 Utrecht, Ghent and other universities launched talks on\u000a      developing a new joint\u000a      masters programme in literary translation. [10]\u000a    - At UCL itself, in 2012 the DLU, via the Steunpunt Literair Vertalen,\u000a      supported a workshop\u000a      on Literary Translation, to bridge the gap between university study and\u000a      literary translation\u000a      as a career. Fourteen students from all over the UK were selected. The\u000a      DLU, through the\u000a      Expertisecentrum Literair Vertalen, contributed 40% of the total costs\u000a      which came to\u000a      &#8364;10,000.[10]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research on the discipline of Dutch Studies conducted at UCL contributed\u000a      to recommendations\u000a      from the Raad voor de Nederlandse Taal en Letteren (Council for Dutch\u000a      Language and Literature),\u000a      providing policy advice to the Committee of Ministers overseeing the Dutch\u000a      Language Union, the\u000a      intergovernmental organisation responsible for the internal and external\u000a      language policies of the\u000a      Netherlands and Flanders.

They\u000a      focused particularly on the nature of the boundary between the disciplines\u000a      of history and literature\u000a      and the role of literary history in the curriculum and in research carried\u000a      out by Dutch Studies\u000a      departments. Two key aims of the research were i) the internationalisation\u000a      of university curricula in\u000a      Dutch Studies by using post-structuralist theory to challenge assumptions\u000a      about the rigidity of\u000a      these disciplinary boundaries, thus paving the way for a more fluid\u000a      conceptualisation of Dutch\u000a      Studies, and ii) to provide a critical perspective from outside the\u000a      Netherlands and Flanders [b], [d].\u000a    An early study (2004, [a]) contrasted internal and external perspectives\u000a      on Dutch literary history,\u000a      while subsequent research (2005-6) explored a historiographical shift to\u000a      narrativism and renewed\u000a      interest in the historical context of literature in the last decades of\u000a      the twentieth century [b]. It\u000a      examined the prefaces and introductions to histories of Dutch literature\u000a      since 1925 to track shifts in\u000a      the relationship of historicist thought to the study of literature.\u000a      Demonstrating the fluidity of this\u000a      relationship, the research recommended a renewed emphasis on cultural,\u000a      social and political\u000a      history within the Dutch Studies curriculum worldwide. A more practical\u000a      study demonstrated the\u000a      role that literature and literary history can play in university curricula\u000a      outside the Netherlands and\u000a      Flanders [c]. Thus the follow-up study (2007-8) focused on disciplinary\u000a      practices outside the\u000a      Netherlands and Flanders, using the UK as a case study [d]. Using research\u000a      undertaken by\u000a      Professors of Dutch Studies at the University of London between 1919 and\u000a      1970, this genealogical\u000a      study again focused on the boundaries between the disciplines of history\u000a      and literature. More\u000a      specifically, it tracked their separation from the nineteenth-century area\u000a      of study known as Letters\/\u000a      Letteren &#8212; which persisted longer in the Netherlands than in the UK &#8212; into\u000a      distinct academic\u000a      disciplines.

Fulbrook's\u000d\u000a      work on the German dictatorships has contributed to enhanced understanding\u000d\u000a      among a range of beneficiaries, including regional government\u000d\u000a      representatives, students in secondary, further and higher education,\u000d\u000a      families of survivors and perpetrators, and members of the public\u000d\u000a      nationally and internationally.\u000d\u000a    Fulbrook's research has reached an international public audience, and\u000d\u000a        in doing so has increased public engagement with an important but little\u000d\u000a        discussed topic: not only the experiences of victims, but also the\u000d\u000a      role of functionaries in keeping the machinery of the Third Reich running,\u000d\u000a      as well as later self-representations. This impact was conveyed through\u000d\u000a      the publication of a widely read book, substantial media appearances\u000d\u000a      (including on television and radio and in newspapers) reaching several\u000d\u000a      million people between 2012 and July 2013 alone [1].\u000d\u000a    In the few months between publication (September 2012 in the UK, December\u000d\u000a      2012 in the USA) and July 2013, A Small Town near Auschwitz, sold\u000d\u000a      5,145 copies worldwide (hardback and ebook). It received acclamatory\u000d\u000a      reviews in the international literary press. The New York Review of\u000d\u000a        Books called it a `milestone in Holocaust historiography' (20 June\u000d\u000a      2013; circ. 135,000). The Times Literary Supplement (15 February\u000d\u000a      2013, circ. 100,000) suggested that `few bring the professional and the\u000d\u000a      personal into such compelling conjunction'. Jonathan Yardley, reviewing\u000d\u000a      what he called `this fine book' in the Washington Post (1 December\u000d\u000a      2012, digital and print daily readership 474,767), says that the account\u000d\u000a      is `absolutely necessary to an understanding' of the events and their\u000d\u000a      wider significance. The Methodist Recorder (8 March 2013, 22,000)\u000d\u000a      stated the book had relevance for understanding the human capacity for\u000d\u000a      `complicity in evil acts' [1].\u000d\u000a    The reach of this engagement was widened through radio programmes in\u000d\u000a      several countries, including BBC Radio 3 Night Waves (27 September 2012;\u000d\u000a      1.9m weekly station listeners); City Talk 105.9 (24 October 2012: 60,000);\u000d\u000a      Radio City 97.7 (24 October 2012; 428,000) Newstalk Radio, Dublin (237,000\u000d\u000a      daily listeners);. Circulation figures for newspaper coverage, in addition\u000d\u000a      to the above, include: The Guardian (digital and print monthly\u000d\u000a      readership 8.95 million), The Observer (223,588); BBC History\u000d\u000a        magazine (80,009); Who Do You Think You Are? Magazine\u000d\u000a      (22,642); Camden New Journal (69,323). Cross-media posting further\u000d\u000a      widened visibility e.g. the Washington Post review was posted on\u000d\u000a      the Auschwitz Museum Twitter feed (1 December 2012, 3,256 followers) and\u000d\u000a      included in the American Society for Yad Vashem's bi-monthly journal Martyrdom\u000a        and Resistance (January-February 2013). An interview with Marshall\u000d\u000a      Poe for the `New Books in History' website was downloaded 34,500 times\u000d\u000a      between December 2012 and July 2013.\u000d\u000a    Between November 2012 and July 2013 Fulbrook also delivered public talks\u000d\u000a      at home and abroad, including two of the biggest UK literary festivals at\u000d\u000a      Oxford and Hay-on-Wye where audience numbers averaged some 400 and\u000d\u000a      included members of the general public, along with historians, educators\u000d\u000a      and people with personal connections to the Holocaust. Other events were\u000d\u000a      organised by: the Pears Institute for the Study of Antisemitism; Spiro\u000d\u000a      Ark; the Wiener Library; and the Institute for Jewish Studies. In New\u000d\u000a      York, Fulbrook was invited to speak to public audiences at the Jewish Book\u000d\u000a      Council in May 2012; Queens New York Jewish Community Council on 28 March\u000d\u000a      2013; and the Fraternal Order of Bendiner-Sosnowicer on 31 March 2013,\u000d\u000a      where survivors and members of families from the B&#281;dzin area were present\u000d\u000a      [4].\u000d\u000a    The significance of this impact was as diverse as the audiences.\u000d\u000a      Individuals from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds around the world\u000d\u000a      have emphasised how much the book has affected their understanding of\u000d\u000a        themselves, their families and communities. In the German press, for\u000d\u000a      example, an open letter to Fulbrook in a Rheinland newspaper thanked her\u000d\u000a      for both enlightening the writer about the `the big question of how it was\u000d\u000a      ever possible for the \"Third Reich\" to have developed in what was a\u000d\u000a      \"Kulturnation\"` as well as making aspects of the writer's own troubled\u000d\u000a      relationship with his `ordinary perpetrator' father more comprehensible.\u000d\u000a      Fulbrook has also received many personal e-mails. One German wrote: `On a\u000d\u000a      personal level it was a veritable eye opener of how we as a family have\u000d\u000a      rationalised my own grand-father's role in the fascist system'. An\u000d\u000a      American wrote: `Most importantly, you have made me ask myself a very\u000d\u000a      uncomfortable question. Where in 2012 are our blinkers?' A child of\u000d\u000a      survivors wrote that this is `a personal and important book that should\u000d\u000a      generate a lot of discussion about the German organizational structure\u000d\u000a      that allowed the murder of our Polish Jewish families to happen with\u000d\u000a      bureaucratic precision and antiseptic decision-making. And then convinced\u000d\u000a      themselves that they were innocent.' Many more could be quoted [5].\u000d\u000a    Fulbrook's research also contributed to changing the way in which the\u000d\u000a        legacy of a German administrator was commemorated by his successors.\u000d\u000a      Central to Fulbrook's research [d] was the complicated legacy of Udo\u000d\u000a      Klausa (the former Nazi civilian administrator of B&#281;dzin and the first\u000d\u000a      post-war Director of the Rhineland Regional Council (LVR) in North-Rhine\u000d\u000a      Westphalia 1954-1975). On 30 May 2012 Fulbrook delivered a public lecture\u000d\u000a      at D&#252;sseldorf University to an audience including current representatives\u000d\u000a      of the Rhineland Regional Council. As a result of Fulbrook's research the\u000d\u000a      Rhineland Regional Council withdrew from their website an adulatory\u000d\u000a      biography of Klausa and amended their public exhibitions [6].\u000d\u000a    Research on the GDR also reached a wide public through panel events and\u000d\u000a      media presentations, leaving an online legacy in podcasts and transcripts.\u000d\u000a      These ranged from an event with the President of the Humboldt University\u000d\u000a      Berlin, through small discussions with former dissidents and Christians in\u000d\u000a      a church in East Berlin, to an interview with Geraldine Doogue on\u000d\u000a      `Saturday Extra', Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, 7\u000d\u000a      November 2009 (weekly audience 126,000). The significance of Fulbrook's\u000d\u000a      work on `perfectly normal lives' in the GDR for German self-understandings\u000d\u000a      and public debates is reflected in both popular and scholarly reviews,\u000d\u000a      including the prestigious daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (14\u000d\u000a      Jan 2009), the G&#246;ttingen Institute for Research on Democracy (18 May 2010)\u000d\u000a      and the Institute for Civic Education [7].\u000d\u000a    Fulbrook's research has influenced the teaching of modern German\u000d\u000a        history in secondary schools, and been used to develop widely\u000d\u000a        used educational resources. In 2007, she released a documentary film\u000d\u000a      on the GDR, Behind the Wall: `Perfectly Normal Lives' in the GDR,\u000d\u000a      based on the AHRC-sponsored collaborative research project and using\u000d\u000a      archival material, location footage, and oral history interviews. 1,000\u000d\u000a      copies of the film were distributed and it has been adopted for teaching\u000d\u000a      and extracurricular purposes in universities and public education centres\u000d\u000a      in the USA, Europe and the UK, such as Queen Mary University of London\u000d\u000a      (QMUL); benefits for learning outcomes include the `appeal to students to\u000d\u000a      learn about individual experience via filmed interviews' [8]. Sections of\u000d\u000a      the film were also adopted as teaching materials for the OCR A Level\u000d\u000a      history syllabus.\u000d\u000a    Fulbrook was requested to write chapters 5 and 6 in Dictatorship and\u000d\u000a        Democracy in Germany 1919-1963 (Heinemann: OCR History A Level,\u000d\u000a      2008), and collate research-based sources for the accompanying LiveText\u000d\u000a      materials and CD Rom. These materials were based on Fulbrook's GDR\u000d\u000a      research, and constituted a major section of the module `Germany under\u000d\u000a      Democracy and Dictatorship' in the OCR History A Level Board's revised\u000d\u000a      syllabus. Since its adoption in 2008, over 6,500 copies have been sold and\u000d\u000a      the newly revised materials have been positively reviewed by secondary\u000d\u000a      educators for The Historical Association [9].\u000d\u000a    Between 2008 and 2013 Fulbrook delivered 15 lectures in Sovereign\u000d\u000a      Education programmes around the UK to audiences averaging 200-300 A level\u000d\u000a      students and teachers. Sovereign Education state that her presentations\u000d\u000a      `have always been a highlight for the students and their teachers' and\u000d\u000a      that students and teachers `are aware of the valuable contribution she has\u000d\u000a      made to their A level understanding and performance'. Indeed, `many go\u000d\u000a      away inspired to continue their studies in history at university'. Their\u000d\u000a      evaluation records cite an `animated and enthusiastic speaker who engaged\u000d\u000a      the students with a good range of useful, relevant material and ideas'\u000d\u000a      [10].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The research has had an impact on public understanding of the contested\u000d\u000a      German past.

Fulbrook and her team argued (for example\u000d\u000a      [a], [b] below) that, in contrast to dichotomous approaches focussing on\u000d\u000a      `state' versus `society', or `regime' versus `people', it is crucial to\u000d\u000a      explore transformations of social attitudes and behaviour, and the ways in\u000d\u000a      which East Germans were actively involved in a `participatory\u000d\u000a      dictatorship'.\u000d\u000a    Her research on generations in Germany from 1905 to 1995 [c], sought to\u000d\u000a      bring together the levels of historical events and structures with\u000d\u000a      patterns of behaviour and culturally filtered subjective experiences,\u000d\u000a      analysed from the perspective of social generations. This research\u000d\u000a      analysed the experiences of different age cohorts across the century, but\u000d\u000a      focussed on two: the first `war youth generation', born in the first\u000d\u000a      decade of the twentieth century, many of whom proved to be crucial\u000d\u000a      carriers of Nazism (and a small minority of whom were among the founding\u000d\u000a      fathers of the GDR); and the `1929ers', born in the later years of the\u000d\u000a      Weimar Republic and socialised primarily under Nazism, but who in an\u000d\u000a      extraordinary historical twist became the most reliable and committed\u000d\u000a      supporters of the subsequent communist dictatorship, the GDR. By analysing\u000d\u000a      the lives of selected individuals facing challenges distinctive to their\u000d\u000a      generations, this project developed a new interpretation of experiences of\u000d\u000a      living through the Third Reich and GDR, and, more generally, a new\u000d\u000a      historical approach as `history from within'.\u000d\u000a    In A Small Town near Auschwitz: Ordinary Nazis and the Holocaust\u000d\u000a      [d], Fulbrook explored the development of Nazi racist policies and\u000d\u000a      genocide in B&#281;dzin, a small town and county in Eastern Upper Silesia, just\u000d\u000a      25 miles north of Auschwitz. Some 85,000 Jews were deported through the\u000d\u000a      linked ghettos of B&#281;dzin-Sosnowiec; almost all the Jewish citizens of\u000d\u000a      B&#281;dzin, around half the total population of this town, were murdered as a\u000d\u000a      result of Nazi oppression; yet it has virtually escaped the attention of\u000d\u000a      historians. Moreover, the role of mid-level civilian functionaries in\u000d\u000a      creating the preconditions for the Holocaust has only recently become the\u000d\u000a      subject of historical research. Civilian administrators have also almost\u000d\u000a      entirely escaped public conceptions of `perpetrators', who are generally\u000d\u000a      seen as those engaged in direct physical acts of violence rather than the\u000d\u000a      behind-the- scenes administration of ghettoization and policies of\u000d\u000a      stigmatisation, exploitation, expropriation and starvation. Fulbrook's\u000d\u000a      research focused primarily on the role and later self-representations of\u000d\u000a      the Landrat (chief executive or principal civilian administrator)\u000d\u000a      of B&#281;dzin, Udo Klausa, who went on to a successful postwar career in the\u000d\u000a      West German civil service as the first Director of the Rhineland Regional\u000d\u000a      Council. Based on a range of sources, including private letters from the Landrat's\u000a      wife during the war, contemporary archival sources, the records of\u000d\u000a      subsequent legal investigations, the Landrat's 1980 memoirs, and\u000d\u000a      survivor testimonies and oral history interviews, the book explores the\u000d\u000a      implications of `systemic violence' and the role of German civilian\u000d\u000a      administrators as `Hitler's willing functionaries'. It also reflects on\u000d\u000a      the character of later memories, in an effort to probe beyond the familiar\u000d\u000a      focus on acts of physical violence and atrocities, and on the subjective\u000d\u000a      role of the historian in confronting this history.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34806","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Philippe Marli&#232;re's research and analysis of the 2012 French presidential\u000a      election extended the range and improved the quality of evidence about\u000a      this important election, notably through his contributions to media\u000a      coverage of that election in Britain and France. It provided the vital\u000a      contextualisation required for the British media &#8212; especially the BBC &#8212; to\u000a      present a more nuanced and informed picture of the changing French\u000a      political landscape in their coverage of the presidential election and, in\u000a      turn, helped to inform the British public of likely electoral and\u000a      political outcomes and the social and political contexts in which they\u000a      would occur. In particular, his research facilitated an improved public\u000a      and media understanding of the role of third party candidates in both the\u000a      election itself and the political landscape thereafter.\u000a    Contributions to French coverage of the 2012 presidential election:\u000a      The first round of the presidential election was held in France on 22\u000a      April 2012. Nicholas Sarkozy, the incumbent and leader of the centre-right\u000a      Union pour un mouvement populaire (UMP), sought re-election to a\u000a      second five-year term against a presidential challenge from Fran&#231;ois\u000a      Hollande of the increasingly centre-left Parti socialiste (PS).\u000a      The election was widely held to be a two-horse race between these\u000a      candidates, and was treated almost exclusively as such by the UK media.\u000a      However Marli&#232;re argued, on the basis of the research outlined above, that\u000a      Jean-Luc M&#233;lenchon (Left Front) and Marine Le Pen (National Front) would\u000a      also perform well. In 2010-2011, he shared these insights with a broad\u000a      non-academic audience through a series of articles for Le Monde,\u000a      the world's principal French language daily with a circulation of some\u000a      340,000 copies per issue, 35,000 of which are distributed outside of\u000a      France [1]. In those articles, Marli&#232;re analysed M&#233;lenchon's potential to\u000a      be an important figure in the 2012 election, the PS's transformation into\u000a      a de-ideologised `catch-all' party, and the likelihood that the left would\u000a      defeat Sarkozy. He also contributed regular blog posts to Mediapart, a\u000a      major left-leaning French journal. These posts, which commented on the\u000a      French elections and were likewise informed by the research outlined above\u000a      typically attracted over 20 comments each, with analyses of M&#233;lenchon and\u000a      the socialist primaries garnering 118 and 154 respectively [2].\u000a    Transfer of expert knowledge informing British media coverage and UK\u000a      public understanding of the presidential election: In the British\u000a    press, M&#233;lenchon's campaign went virtually unreported until the Guardian's\u000a    publication in April 2012 of two lengthy opinion articles &#8212; one by Marli&#232;re,\u000a    the other by Seumas Milne. Both argued that the popularity of M&#233;lenchon's\u000a    ideas and policies was attributable to the fact that no other major\u000a    candidate was engaging working-class voters. Marli&#232;re further suggested that\u000a    although M&#233;lenchon's policy proposals might be described as `radical' they\u000a    were sufficiently coherent to be taken seriously [3]. Both articles, in a\u000a    newspaper with a print and online readership approaching 2m [3], received a\u000a    great deal of attention: Marli&#232;re's attracted 320 comments, and Milne's 562,\u000a    most of them sympathetic to this view. The electronic version of Marli&#232;re's\u000a    article was tweeted over 200 times, and shared over 1,800 times on Facebook\u000a    [3]. Those impacts were compounded by Marli&#232;re's production of an election\u000a    diary, which appeared in 11 instalments between 23 April and 4 May 2012 on\u000a    OpenDemocracy, a leading UK news website with over 3.5m unique views per\u000a    year. Here, Marli&#232;re used research findings to demonstrate the potential for\u000a    `small' candidates to capitalise on both negative factors (the unpopularity\u000a    of the main candidates and their very similar policy proposals) and positive\u000a    factors (good campaigning by the Left Front and an improved image for the\u000a    National Front) [5].\u000a    Recognising and seeking to redress the imbalance and gaps in its own\u000a      coverage, the BBC's Analysis and Research Unit invited Marli&#232;re to brief\u000a      journalists during the run-up to the election. This off-the-record\u000a      briefing was delivered to some 50 journalists, anchors, UK and Europe\u000a      reporters, programme editors and researchers on 4 April 2012 at White City\u000a      Television Centre (London), a month before the first round of the\u000a      election. It comprised a forty-minute talk providing context on developing\u000a      issues and contacts for further insights, followed by questions from the\u000a      floor. Explaining that his analysis showed no strong political momentum\u000a      for the main candidates (Sarkozy, Hollande and Bayrou, a centrist),\u000a      Marli&#232;re predicted rises that both the left-wing candidate Jean-Luc\u000a      M&#233;lenchon and the extreme-right candidate Marine le Pen would rise in the\u000a      polls and eventually come in third and fourth position.\u000a    This intervention helped BBC journalists understand the major issues at\u000a      stake in the election and significantly increased the attention they paid\u000a      to the `smaller' candidates who, as Marli&#232;re predicted, did eventually\u000a      fare better than had been suggested by the media at the start of the\u000a      campaign [10]. The event organiser noted the very positive feedback from\u000a      journalists, who had found it `useful', `interesting', `relevant' and\u000a      `well-timed'. Marli&#232;re himself received personal thanks from several\u000a      journalists, who said that they would take his advice on board when\u000a      reporting the election. Indeed, such was its usefulness that the BBC used\u000a      the original briefing as the basis for its development of digitalised\u000a      resources for use by its journalist: thus the College of Journalism, which\u000a      oversees training for BBC editorial staff, filmed two clips for an\u000a      internal website accessible only to BBC journalists. The briefing\u000a      organiser also made an audio recording and transcription of the session.\u000a      These valuable information and resources were subsequently accessed at\u000a      least 100 times by journalists working on the election [10]. Coverage of\u000a      the election on the BBC's website, which had previously almost entirely\u000a      excluded consideration of M&#233;lenchon's election prospects, showed a\u000a      markedly increased inclination after Marli&#232;re's briefing to provide much\u000a      fuller treatment [6].\u000a    Marli&#232;re's analysis proved accurate, and thus instrumental in ensuring\u000a      that BBC journalists covered the election fairly and accurately. Le Pen\u000a      eventually received over 15% of the share of the votes nationally and came\u000a      third, while M&#233;lenchon received over 11%.\u000a    The value of the briefing to BBC journalists is further suggested by the\u000a      numerous requests for interviews and comment from Marli&#232;re. Media\u000a      appearances during the election run-up included:\u000a    - BBC Radio 4 Westminster Hour, 22 April 2012. On the 2012 French\u000a      presidential results (first round), reaching over 10.5 million (RAJAR all\u000a      regions, 3 months ending June 2012).\u000a    - BBC Radio 5, Breakfast Programme, 2 May and 7 May 2012. On the\u000a      television debate between Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran&#231;ois Hollande, and on\u000a      the second round of the French presidential election, reaching over 6\u000a      million (RAJAR all regions, 3 months ending June 2012).\u000a    - BBC World, 6 May and 15 May 2012. Special programme on the\u000a      election (including live coverage of election results), and contribution\u000a      to coverage of Hollande's inaugural ceremony (on air 9am-12.30pm): BBC\u000a      World TV attracts a global audience of 97m [7].\u000a    These led, in turn, led to appearances on other international news\u000a      outlets, notably including Sky (on `Adam Boulton and Co', 15 May 2012) and\u000a      the American public broadcaster NPR (on Background Briefing Production:\u000a      thirty-minute interviews on 23 April and 6 May 2012). Meanwhile, M&#233;lenchon\u000a      himself was invited to a series of media appearances, reflecting the new\u000a      recognition in the UK of his role as a left-wing player in French\u000a      politics. These included a video interview with the Guardian (416\u000a      viewer comments [8]), and interviews for the New Statesman and\u000a      OpenDemocracy.\u000a    Subsequent contributions to UK public understanding of the French\u000a        political landscape: The contribution made by the research to\u000a      enhancing UK public understanding of the French political landscape\u000a      continued even after the election ended. On 6 December 2012, in\u000a      collaboration with the European Institute at UCL, Marli&#232;re invited\u000a      M&#233;lenchon to present his ideas as a prominent French politician to a mixed\u000a      audience of some 440 students, academics, ambassadors, politicians,\u000a      trade-unionists, journalists and members of the public. Marli&#232;re was\u000a      responsible for deciding the terms of the event and, in his introduction,\u000a      presented an analysis of the role of left wing politics in France in\u000a      austerity Europe. The event gave UK journalists and the public a rare\u000a      opportunity to hear at first hand the views of a French leftist\u000a      politician; the academic contextualisation of those views provided a\u000a      nuanced assessment of the French political landscape.\u000a    The event was extremely successful: though organised at short notice all\u000a      tickets, in three separate issues, sold out immediately. In total 440\u000a      people attended, though emails received by the European Institute suggest\u000a      that as many as 650 ticket requests were made [11]. The benefits from this\u000a      presentation of information and analysis were maximised by its live\u000a      streaming, and the development of information and learning resources whose\u000a      online accessibility extended the reach of the original benefits to a much\u000a      wider public. More than 2,500 viewers watched the live stream and the\u000a      video on UCL's Vimeo account showed it had been played over 7,000 times by\u000a      31 July 2013, including over 3,000 from Facebook alone [12]. Partly thanks\u000a      to the increased understanding of M&#233;lenchon's position among British media\u000a      professionals, the event was well attended by journalists, including\u000a      representatives from the Independent, Guardian, OpenDemocracy,\u000a      the New Statesman and the Morning Star. Although\u000a      M&#233;lenchon's speech was delivered in French, OpenDemocracy recognised its\u000a      importance and had it transcribed and translated for its own website\u000a      (15\/1\/13); it also published an interview with the candidate (11\/1\/13), as\u000a      did the New Statesmen (12\/12\/12), the UK's biggest political\u000a      website, with over 1.1m unique users [13].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Philippe Marli&#232;re's research on social democracy in Europe, and\u000a      particularly in France, extended the range and quality of information\u000a      regarding the French presidential election (2012), and thus made an\u000a      important contribution to public understanding in both the UK and France.\u000a      This was achieved through a series of high profile press publications in\u000a      Le Monde, Mediapart, the Guardian, OpenDemocracy and other outlets, which\u000a      were both widely read and led to substantial debate online and on social\u000a      media.

He became Professor of French and European Politics in September\u000a      2010. Since 1994, his scholarly work on French and European politics has\u000a      been translated into fifteen languages and has appeared in 29 countries.\u000a      The research specifically underpinning impacts and described here falls\u000a      into two key areas.\u000a    In work on Social Democracy and European politics Marli&#232;re has\u000a      particularly considered the question of whether social democracy may be\u000a      considered an homogeneous `party family' across Europe, such that it is\u000a      possible to draw a typology of the New Social Democracy beyond national\u000a      differences. In a comparative study undertaken between 1997 and 1999,he\u000a      established that there was, indeed, a movement of ideological and policy\u000a      convergence across Europe. This was further demonstrated by research\u000a      undertaken from 1996 on the `Third Way' in Britain and `Modern Socialism'\u000a      in France, in which Marli&#232;re showed that the emergence of more consensual\u000a      relationships between centre-left and centre-right parties would create a\u000a      political space liable to exploitation by both left-wing and extreme-right\u000a      parties.\u000a    With Robert Ladrech (Keele), Marli&#232;re co-edited Social Democratic\u000a        Parties in the European Union. History, Organisation, Policies\u000a      (Macmillan 1999), a project drawing on the expertise of 16 European\u000a      specialists on the subject. Following the publication of this seminal\u000a      volume, and of several peer-reviewed articles and book chapters on the\u000a      topic, Marli&#232;re was awarded the Marcel Liebman Chair of political science\u000a      at the Universit&#233; Libre of Brussels (ULB) in 2007, in recognition of his\u000a      contribution to the study of European social democracy. The lectures took\u000a      place daily between 19 February and 24 February at ULB and were on the\u000a      following topics: \"From the Labour Party to New Labour: a new type of\u000a      party\"; \"The Third Way: theoretical considerations and debates\";\u000a      \"Blairism, from theory to practice: the economy and Europe\"; \"Is Blairism\u000a      the future of European social democracy?\" Following these lectures Aden\u000a      Publishers (Brussels) asked him to turn them into a book (La\u000a        Social-d&#233;mocratie domestiqu&#233;e, 2008).\u000a    In research published in 2009 and 2010 and more specifically focused on French\u000a        political ideas and party politics, Marli&#232;re tracked the convergence\u000a      of France's two major parties, the centre-right Union pour un\u000a        mouvement populaire (UMP) and the centre-left Parti socialiste\u000a      (PS) to the political centre [a]. For instance, in [b] he discussed the\u000a      French Socialist Party's ambivalent and uneasy relationship to European\u000a      integration and concluded that despite its ambivalence, the PS's stand on\u000a      Europe was actually falling in line with the economically `moderate' and\u000a      `pro-market' orientation of mainstream social democracy in Europe. He also\u000a      documented the rise of parties further to the left or right, for instance,\u000a      analysing the political results of French political parties at the 2009\u000a      elections, and explaining the reasons for the rise of `smaller' parties on\u000a      the left and on the right of the political spectrum [c]. This work on\u000a      political ideologies and conflicts in France enabled him to anticipate the\u000a      rise of political forces to the left of Fran&#231;ois Hollande's PS and to the\u000a      right of Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP in the 2012 presidential election. Notable\u000a      among the specific research findings supporting his this insight were\u000a      expounded in two co-edited journal issues. The edited issue on the French\u000a      left [e] showed that the rise of Jean-Luc M&#233;lenchon's Left Front was\u000a      largely responsible for Fran&#231;ois Hollande's shift to the left during the\u000a      presidential campaign. The issue on the Sarkozy presidency [f] explained\u000a      how the incumbent president's shift to the right has enabled Hollande to\u000a      occupy the political centre ground, a winning position in the two-round\u000a      French presidential election. This analysis is being further developed in\u000a      current research on the Left Party, to appear from Palgrave-Macmillan in\u000a      2014, as The Left Front and the Revival of Left-Wing Radicalism in\u000a        France.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34807","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Nordic Noir Crime Fiction Book Club (NNBC) exists as an online\u000a      community and also hosts\u000a      regular events in London. It was founded to enhance viewers' experience of\u000a      Nordic crime literature\u000a      and television by providing relevant background information and\u000a      facilitating discussion about\u000a      Scandinavian culture and society, through engagement with the research\u000a      described in section 2.\u000a      Since its launch in February 2011 to coincide with the arrival of the\u000a      Danish television series The\u000a        Killing in the UK, and up to 31 July 2013, there were a dozen NNBC\u000a      events, averaging 40-50\u000a      attendees, in settings including cafes, community centres, arts venues,\u000a      museums, and the Danish\u000a      Embassy [1]. From this initial aim of deepening the enjoyment of a defined\u000a      online and face-to-face\u000a      community of fans by enhancing contextual understanding, NNBC has expanded\u000a      its reach to\u000a      provide similar benefits to a wider audience, through the national and\u000a      international press, and\u000a      through invited participation in public events.\u000a    The reach of the NNBC is demonstrated by its high profile\u000a        online and on social media: the\u000a      accompanying Wordpress blog, featuring commentary and event summaries, had\u000a      51,841 visits\u000a      from individuals in 105 countries between January 2011 and July 2013 [2].\u000a      Podcasts of selected\u000a      events on UCL iTunesU were downloaded or streamed 392 times in the first\u000a      month they were\u000a      launched (September 2011) and have sustained popularity, with 639\u000a      downloads\/streams between\u000a      January and July 2013. The NNBC Facebook page attracted over 500 `likes'\u000a      by July 2013, while\u000a      NNBC and Department of Scandinavian Studies (which retweets NNBC material\u000a      and vice versa)\u000a      had a combined reach of over 1,300 Twitter followers [3].\u000a    Within this larger pool of beneficiaries was the core group consisting of\u000a      some 300 active London-\u000a      based fans of Nordic crime fiction and television, who attended events and\u000a      joined our mailing list,\u000a      and participated in discussion and knowledge exchange via our social media\u000a      platforms. Member\u000a      profiles included various professions (from psychotherapist to civil\u000a      servant, to radio researcher),\u000a      with ages ranging from teens to 70s. Around half of participants at each\u000a      event were repeat\u000a      attendees, demonstrating that this is a sustainable and growing\u000a        community. To attract an\u000a      enthusiastic audience, most events for NNBC members featured a visiting\u000a      Nordic author or\u000a      director. The guest speaker's contribution was complemented with lively\u000a      and accessible\u000a      presentations by UCL researchers, and hosted by a UCL researcher whose\u000a      expertise matched the\u000a      thematic or national focus, and thus stimulated discussion between\u000a      audience and speakers.\u000a    For example: The Bridge Briefing (2.5.2012) attracted a paying audience\u000a      of 45, and responded to\u000a      UK interest in the Danish-Swedish crime co-production Broen (The\u000a      Bridge). This series centres on\u000a      the relationship between Danish and Swedish detectives, and crucial to the\u000a      UK viewers' enjoyment\u000a      of the series are many implicit regionally-specific tensions and\u000a      practices, spanning language, law,\u000a      culture and political norms (the fictional killer's motive is to spark\u000a      debate on social and legal\u000a      injustices). The event was planned by crowd-sourcing via Twitter what\u000a      kinds of background\u000a      information UK viewers needed. Four 20-minute presentations by invited\u000a      speakers covered\u000a      Danish-Swedish cross-linguistic communication (a key narrative device in\u000a      the series); an overview\u000a      of the portrayal of the region in crime fiction; and the political and\u000a      architectural context of the\u000a      &#216;resund Bridge and regional development. The event was hosted by Thomson,\u000a      who drew on her\u000a      published and ongoing work on the cultural, literary, filmic and social\u000a      history of the region [e, f] to\u000a      identify emerging themes, plant relevant questions, and facilitate\u000a      audience discussion [1].\u000a    Feedback received during and after such events was uniformly\u000a      positive. Qualitative evidence of\u000a      impact was gathered using feedback forms, and the Wordpress blog. Comments\u000a      include: `Another\u000a      excellent event [...] thanks to Jakob, I understand the fine distinctions\u000a      between the (seemingly)\u000a      hundreds of Danish political parties (where Right is Left and Left is\u000a      Right)' (Barry Forshaw, blog,\u000a      19.2.12, after Borgen Briefing event); `I hadn't appreciated the closeness\u000a      of the community -\u000a      people knowing each other quite so much. The need for the sidekick in\u000a      literature was already\u000a      documented but to explain so much of Icelandic history\/geography not\u000a      previously appreciated'\u000a      (anonymous feedback form, June 2011, after NNBC meeting with Icelandic\u000a      author Yrsa\u000a      Sigurdardottir) [1].\u000a    NNBC attendees thus benefited from an improved understanding of the\u000a        social, political,\u000a        historical and linguistic issues pertinent to the Nordic crime\u000a      fiction and television they enjoyed.\u000a      They benefited from provision of background information which assisted in\u000a      satisfying\u000a      interpretations of plot, setting and characterisation, and were involved\u000a      in collective reflection, with\u000a      likeminded attendees, authors and UCL researchers on issues related to\u000a      reading, viewing, writing,\u000a      translating and programming. The meetings stimulated subtle and detailed\u000a      public debate on issues\u000a      central to crime fiction &#8212; criminality, ethics, social change, ethnic and\u000a      gender identities &#8212; which play\u000a      out in distinctive but comparable ways in Scandinavia and Britain.\u000a    Beyond our London events and our blog, our research and the mediation\u000a      model developed through\u000a      NNBC resulted in numerous invitations to participate in public events\u000a        and media stories in\u000a      Britain and abroad, demonstrating the significance of our research-led\u000a      contribution through NNBC\u000a      to this popular subject. For example, in March 2012 Stougaard-Nielsen was\u000a      invited to discuss\u000a      Scandinavian crime fiction's popularity in Britain at Horsens Bogmesse, a\u000a      major Danish book\u000a      festival held in a former prison [4], based on his research for [d]. In\u000a      March 2012 he appeared in the\u000a      BBC4 documentary Time Shift: Nordic Noir (2011), on BBC5 Live\u000a      Saturday Edition [5] - the\u000a      RAJAR listener figures for the station in March 2012 were 6 million and\u000a      the programme has had\u000a      58,659 views on YouTube. His UCL Lunch Hour Lecture for the public on the\u000a      relationship between\u000a      the welfare state and crime fiction (drawing on [c]) has had 662 views on\u000a      UCL Youtube and the\u000a      resulting SoundCloud podcast was listened to 2,700 times during the impact\u000a      period. He also\u000a      contributed material on crime fiction to two Brain Train podcasts on the\u000a      environment and\u000a      sociopathy, which together have had 2,922 listeners [5].\u000a      Stougaard-Nielsen's research has also\u000a      enhanced the commercial offerings of Arrow Films, the main distributor of\u000a      Scandinavian drama in\u000a      the UK. Arrow Films commissioned a 1000-word commentary from him in March\u000a      2012 [text\u000a      removed for publication] [10].\u000a    The reach of this work extends across Europe: Stougaard-Nielsen has been\u000a      interviewed in the\u000a      Danish, Italian, Finnish, Slovenian, Greek and UK press. A powerful\u000a      example of synergy between\u000a      media and NNBC came about in Stougaard-Nielsen's interviews with\u000a      Slovenia's largest daily\u000a      newspaper Delo and in the Italian online newspaper\u000a      Affaritaliani.it in July 2011, assessing the\u000a      power of crime fiction to diagnose and mediate racism and extremism after\u000a      the terrorist attacks in\u000a      Norway. These in turn proved to be of interest to NNBC members: when\u000a      extracts were translated\u000a      into English and posted on the NNBC blog, they were viewed 546 times [5].\u000a      Meanwhile Thomson\u000a      was invited to chair a Nordic Noir panel at the London media industry\u000a      event ProMax 2012 as a\u000a      result of NNBC events, and was interviewed by the Danish broadsheet Politiken\u000a      (daily print run of\u000a      94,169, Dansk Oplagskontrol; 800,000 monthly web visitors, wikipedia)\u000a      about the popularity of\u000a      Danish culture in the UK (20.8.2012) [6]. Hilson was invited by the Nordic\u000a      Horizons parliamentarian\u000a      interest group to speak on 27.10.2011 at a sold-out (100-capacity) seminar\u000a      at the Scottish\u000a      Parliament on the Nordic welfare model in the context of growing UK\u000a      (especially Scottish) interest\u000a      in the culture and society of the region [7]. Such discussions require us\u000a      to explain to a\u000a      Scandinavian audience the popularity of Nordic popular culture in the UK\u000a      (drawing on research\u000a      such as [b] in section 3), or to explain aspects of Nordic culture to a UK\u000a      or international audience\u000a      (drawing on research such as [a], [c-f] listed in section 3).\u000a    A significant instance of audience expansion was our video for The\u000a        Guardian Online, conceived\u000a      by Thomson and Vicky Frost (Television and Radio Editor at The\u000a        Guardian), and presented by\u000a      Jesper Hansen, Teaching Fellow in Danish. Planned in conjunction with the\u000a      UK launch of The\u000a        Killing III in November 2012, the video enhanced the viewing\u000a      experience of readers by providing a\u000a      language-focused cultural briefing. The video attracted [text removed for\u000a      publication] 260\u000a      comments from readers, including: `just wanted to say that I wish all\u000a      foreign language learning\u000a      materials were as interesting and fun as this mini-lesson' (GavinRoberts,\u000a      16.11.12). [8]. This video\u000a      was followed by a Q&amp;A feature hosted by The Guardian's Radio\u000a      &amp; TV blog (14.12.2012), which\u000a      featured Hilson, Stougaard-Nielsen and Hansen answering readers' queries\u000a      about the Danish\u000a      culture underlying The Killing [9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Nordic Noir Crime Fiction Book Club (NNBC) responds to the current\u000a      intense UK interest in\u000a      Scandinavian crime writing and television.

In particular, Hilson (with\u000a      Andersson [b]) has investigated\u000a      how the exceptionalism of the Nordic welfare states, particularly Sweden,\u000a      has led to Scandinavia\u000a      being idealised internationally as a utopia of social equality, with its\u000a      virtues sometimes exaggerated\u000a      for politically expedient reasons. Notably, with the decline of the\u000a      Swedish model, recent decades\u000a      have seen a comprehensive renegotiation of myths and images of Sweden, at\u000a      home and abroad;\u000a      new and contested narratives about Swedishness and Nordicness have emerged\u000a      from cultural and\u000a      political struggles over globalisation, the EU, and immigration.\u000a    While Hilson's collaborative projects focus on historiography and\u000a      political and popular discourse,\u000a      literary fiction is also a powerful locus for the emergence and\u000a      exportation of images of the Nordic\u000a      nations. Jakob Stougaard-Nielsen (Lecturer 2010-2013, Senior\u000a      Lecturer 2013-) has researched\u000a      the role of crime and other literary genres in interrogating and\u000a      re-negotiating the relationship\u000a      between the Nordic (especially Danish) citizen and the welfare state [c].\u000a      His research investigates\u000a      reading practices amongst crime fiction audiences: the circulation and\u000a      consumption of books,\u000a      engagement in social media and other communities, the cognitive and bodily\u000a      aspects of reading.\u000a      His work is an example of how pathways to impact can themselves help\u000a      researchers to develop\u000a      and sharpen their research questions [d].\u000a    Research by Claire Thomson (Lecturer 2007-2013, Senior Lecturer\u000a      2013-) investigates the role\u000a      of visual culture, especially the public information film and similar\u000a      genres, in reflecting and shaping\u000a      the identity of a citizen of the Danish Welfare State. A particular focus\u000a      is how welfare state\u000a      principles and practices were instantiated in the architecture of the\u000a      transnational Danish-Swedish\u000a      &#216;resund region, the setting for much contemporary popular crime\u000a      literature, television drama and\u000a      documentary, and how this in turn functions as visual metaphor and\u000a      physical environment in which\u000a      national and transnational norms are negotiated [e]. Tying together the\u000a      department's collective\u000a      interests in political discourse and literary and cinematic fiction,\u000a      Thomson also researches the mid-\u000a      twentieth-century phenomenon of the kulturfilm: cultural or\u000a      educational short films commissioned\u000a      by the State or by non-governmental organisations. Her work [f]\u000a      investigates the role of the\u000a      cinematic style and affective impact of these short films made to inform,\u000a      to educate, and to\u000a      influence the behaviour of citizens.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35299","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Fowler has succeeded in improving the quality of evidence employed to\u000a      enhance public\u000a      understandings of Mexico's complex past. His research on Santa Anna has\u000a      influenced current\u000a      public discourse in Mexico, by offering a revised interpretation of\u000a      Mexico's historical capital that\u000a      has presented the country's cultural heritage in a new light,\u000a      contributing, in so doing, to Mexico's\u000a      processes of commemoration and memorialisation. The knowledge of\u000a      individuals, groups of\u000a      individuals, and relevant beneficiary communities of place and interest\u000a      has thus been enriched,\u000a      resulting in a measurable public questioning of Mexico's \"official\u000a      history.\" In the words of His\u000a      Excellency the Mexican Ambassador in the UK, Fowler's work as a historian:\u000a      \"helps all of us\u000a      understand the present and to clarify the past of our country.\" (31 May\u000a      2012) [S1].\u000a    The impact of Fowler's research on Santa Anna was evidenced mainly in the\u000a      spheres of Mexican\u000a      culture and society, and was articulated through the researcher's active\u000a      interaction with a range of\u000a      beneficiaries and users outside academia, including those members of the\u000a      general public who\u000a      attended the state-government-sponsored events that were organized\u000a      throughout Mexico, and\u000a      which Fowler participated in, between 2008 and 2011, in the build-up to,\u000a      and as part of, the\u000a      Bicentenary of the War of Independence in 2010. The user feedback provided\u000a      in questionnaires at\u000a      the end of several of Fowler's public lectures confirmed that 81.3% of the\u000a      161 audience members\u000a      who completed the forms agreed that Fowler's research was making Mexicans\u000a      revise the way they\u000a      viewed Santa Anna and their country's past, and that 71.1% believed that\u000a      Fowler's research would\u000a      result in changes in the way that history was taught in primary and\u000a      secondary schools in Mexico\u000a      [S9].\u000a    The evidence of impact was most obvious in the wealth of articles,\u000a      interviews, and reviews that\u000a      Fowler's findings generated in the media (press, radio, TV, and online\u000a      blogs), which are listed\u000a      below and in turn provide a particularly meaningful and resonant measure\u000a      of the extent to which\u000a      his research has resulted in a major mind-shift in the manner in which the\u000a      Mexican public domain\u000a      has come to regard Santa Anna.\u000a    Users belonging to the policy-making community such as the deputy and\u000a      president of the Special\u000a      Support Commission of the Celebrations of the Bicentenary of Independence\u000a      and Centenary of the\u000a      Revolution of the State Congress of Puebla also interacted with Fowler\u000a      during his impact-generating\u000a      public engagements, producing documents and statements that embraced the\u000a      researcher's revisionist interpretation of this long misrepresented and\u000a      misunderstood historical\u000a      figure [S6].\u000a    Other beneficiaries have included a novelist, author of Santa Anna,\u000a        El Lencero y yo. As&#237; me lo\u000a        cont&#243; Antonio L&#243;pez de Santa Anna (Mexico City: SITESA, 2010), in\u000a      whose mind \"the Mexican\u000a      people's understanding of Santa Anna is beginning to change, in no small\u000a      measure thanks to\u000a      works such as Fowler's biography,\" [S3], and a playwright, author of Santa\u000a        Anna, la tentaci&#243;n del\u000a        enga&#241;o, who has gone as far as to state that \"Santa Anna of\u000a        Mexico is one of many worthy works\u000a      that are paving a new road for democratic education in Mexico\" [S3]. Both\u000a      authors have\u000a      acknowledged, moreover, that their creative activities and fictional\u000a      portrayals of Santa Anna were\u000a      significantly influenced by Fowler's biography. Santa Anna's descendants,\u000a      who did not know of\u000a      each other's existence until Fowler put them in touch with each other,\u000a      because they were ashamed\u000a      to let it be known that they were related to the general, have since\u000a      actively participated in public\u000a      engagements that have drawn on Fowler's research to vindicate their\u000a      ancestor [S4, S5]. As noted\u000a      by the descendant of Santa Anna's younger daughter, \"Fowler's balanced\u000a      account has allowed me\u000a      to stand up for my ancestor in public, as his findings and interpretation\u000a      of Mexico's past have\u000a      started to significantly impact upon the manner in which the educated\u000a      population of the country\u000a      have come to understand his actions\" [S5].\u000a    Fowler's interaction with his beneficiary communities of place and\u000a      interest in Mexico arose, initially,\u000a      organically and without a conscious impact-driven strategy. His research\u000a      on Santa Anna had, in\u000a      fact, started to make a cultural impact beyond academia as his findings\u000a      were cited, reviewed, and\u000a      reported outside academic literature in Mexican national newspapers such\u000a      as Cr&#243;nica (26\/01\/05),\u000a      and in a series of TV and radio interviews which culminated in Fowler's\u000a      appearance in the TV\u000a      documentary film Presidentes mexicanos, shown on the weekly\u000a      \"Archivo Abierto\" programme at\u000a      9.00 pm on Canal 11 TV (6\/2\/2005). However, it was in 2008, coinciding\u000a      with the book launch of\u000a      Gobernantes mexicanos3, which took place in the\u000a      auditorium of the Fondo de Cultura Econ&#243;mica's\u000a      Octavio Paz bookshop in Mexico City (24\/11\/08), that, building on the\u000a      noted earlier interactions,\u000a      Fowler's research started to receive significant national coverage in the\u000a      media with interviews\u000a      featuring in several leading national newspapers and cultural magazines\u000a      (e.g., El Universal,\u000a      26\/11\/08 and Metapol&#237;tica, vol. 62 [November-December 2008] [S7]).\u000a      The fact that he was one of\u000a      three Mexicanist scholars invited to represent British academia at the\u000a      State Banquet that was held\u000a      in Buckingham Palace on 30 March 2009 in honour of the State visit of\u000a      Mexican President Felipe\u000a      Calder&#243;n is in itself evidence that his work on Santa Anna and Mexican\u000a      presidents was beginning\u000a      to have a cultural impact in Mexico.\u000a    Having said this, it was throughout 2010, following the publication of\u000a      the translation of Santa Anna,\u000a      and benefitting from the School of Modern Languages' impact strategy (see\u000a      REF3a) that Fowler's\u000a      interpretation of the man and his times really started to resonate in the\u000a      public domain. The\u000a      publication of Santa Anna, integrated as part of the Mexican state\u000a      government-sponsored events\u000a      organized to mark the Bicentenary of Mexico's independence from Spain, was\u000a      carefully planned by\u000a      the author, publishers, and his allocated St-Andrews-based impact-team, in\u000a      order to maximise the\u000a      impact, making the most of the general interest in memorializing Mexico's\u000a      past that was generated\u000a      by the 2010 celebrations. Fowler gave a series of public lectures in high\u000a      profile cultural locations,\u000a      namely, the Cultural Centre IVEC (Veracruz), the Anthropology Museum of\u000a      Xalapa, the State\u000a      Congress of Puebla, the Universidad Iberoamericana in Puebla, and the\u000a      Sal&#243;n de Actos of the\u000a      UNAM (Mexico City). The book presentations and lectures were covered in\u000a      the media (press and\u000a      radio) and generated widespread interest on the internet, inspiring\u000a      several blogs as well as the\u000a      creation of a Santa\u000a        Anna Facebook page and group\u000a      [S8]. By the time Fowler returned to Mexico in\u000a      November 2011 to give a further series of nine public lectures in Mexico\u000a      City, Morelia, Zamora, and\u000a      San Luis Potos&#237;, it was clear that his research was reshaping the\u000a      Mexicans' understanding of\u000a      Santa Anna's historical role. As may be appreciated from the newspaper\u000a      headlines that appeared\u000a      in 2010 and 2011, Fowler's view that Santa Anna was not the villain he had\u000a      been made out to be\u000a      resonated in the public domain, featuring prominently in an extensive\u000a      range of regional and\u000a      national newspapers: \"Historian rehabilitates the image of Santa Anna,\" (Plumas\u000a        libres, 18\/10\/10);\u000a      \"Santa Anna did not sell half of the country, states William Fowler\" (E-Consulta.com,\u000a      19\/10\/10);\u000a      \"Santa Anna was not a traitor: Fowler\" (Milenio, 22\/10\/10); \"Santa\u000a      Anna was no traitor, states\u000a      Scottish Academic Will Fowler in controversial book\" (Azteca 21,\u000a      22\/10\/10); \"Neither a monster nor\u000a      a saint\" (Mi espacio libre, 25\/10\/10); \"Interview with British\u000a      historian Will Fowler.

Other contemporaneous\u000a      publications included articles in prestigious academic journals on\u000a      different aspects of Santa Anna's\u000a      political career4-6.\u000a    Research for these publications, undertaken in regional and national\u000a      archives in Mexico, as well as\u000a      in Britain, Spain, and the United States, was carried out by Prof. Will\u000a      Fowler at the University of St\u000a      Andrews from 1999 onwards. Prior to the dissemination of Fowler's\u000a      findings, General Antonio\u000a      L&#243;pez de Santa Anna (1794-1876) had been consistently depicted as a\u000a      traitor, a turncoat and a\u000a      tyrant in the U.S. to justify the Texan 1835-36 War of Independence and\u000a      the U.S. military\u000a      intervention of 1846-48, and in Mexico to explain and account for the\u000a      country's traumatic defeat in\u000a      the Mexican-American War. Since the late nineteenth century, he was\u000a      therefore presented as the\u000a      traitor who allegedly recognized the independence of Texas in captivity\u000a      (1836), lost the Mexican-American\u000a      War (1846-48) for a fistful of dollars, and shamelessly sold parts of\u000a      Mexico to the United\u000a      States in the Gadsden Purchase (1853). He was also consistently depicted\u000a      as an opportunistic\u000a      turncoat who changed sides whenever it suited him, without upholding any\u000a      distinguishable political\u000a      ideals. Last but not least, he was repeatedly portrayed as the despotic\u000a      dictator who terrorized the\u000a      country following independence: \"a curse upon Mexico\".\u000a    The importance of Fowler's biography lies in the way that this\u000a      inaccurate, simplistic and Manichean\u000a      view has since been significantly revised in the historiography and in\u000a      Mexico more widely. It has\u000a      challenged cultural values and assumptions in Mexican civil society which,\u000a      until recently, had\u000a      chosen not to think about the early republican period (because it was too\u000a      painful), and, when it\u000a      had, blamed Santa Anna for everything that went wrong after independence\u000a      (including Mexico's\u000a      defeat in 1848 &#8212; mistakenly claiming Santa Anna lost the conflict on\u000a      purpose, &#8212; and the traumatic\u000a      loss of half of the country's territory to the United States &#8212; erroneously\u000a      [and deliberately] pretending\u000a      he sold it). Fowler's research has forced Mexicans to revise such an\u000a      interpretation. It has shown\u000a      how Santa Anna was neither a traitor nor a turncoat. Nor was he always a\u000a      tyrant. Instead, the\u000a      Santa Anna that emerges from Fowler's work was a general, a landowner, and\u000a      a nineteenth-century\u000a      caudillo whose political ideas evolved with time and who tried to prosper\u000a      personally and\u000a      help his country develop at a time of severe and repeated crises, as the\u000a      colony that was New\u000a      Spain gave way to a young, troubled, besieged and beleaguered Mexican\u000a      nation.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35300","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This impact narrative has inspired a wide variety of local, national and\u000a      international audiences to reflect on how and why art is produced, and how\u000a      we consume it both financially and intellectually. It has contributed to\u000a      cultural life and education beyond the HEI in which the research took\u000a      place thanks to (1) collaboration with interpreters and creators of\u000a      cultural capital (2) engagement with school pupils (3) public lectures and\u000a      lecture-recitals.\u000a    (1) Collaboration with interpreters and creators of cultural capital:\u000a        performing and creating new works\u000a    Evans rediscovered a series of song settings to which his research has\u000a      drawn new attention and which, with the collaboration of professional\u000a      musicians (mezzo-soprano and piano), he has brought to wider audience\u000a      attention for the first time. Charles Koechlin's 1890s settings of\u000a      Banville's Rondels include some fine examples of late C19th French\u000a      song setting of which only one &#8212; `Le Th&#233;' &#8212; features as part of the common\u000a      repertoire. Evans and the mezzo-soprano (S1) have presented this material\u000a      in public concerts and lectures, `A Celebration of French Song' (St\u000a      Andrews, 10th April 2013) and `The Night Translated' (Brook\u000a      Theatre, Chatham, Kent, 8th May 2013). They commissioned a\u000a      young composer (S2) to set the three remaining Banville poems which\u000a      Koechlin neglected to set, thereby completing the song cycle with\u000a      challenging contemporary works. These pieces were premiered at the spring\u000a      2013 concerts, at which the composer himself was present for discussion,\u000a      and recorded for public consumption on soundcloud, where they have been\u000a      heard over 200 times (S2). Additional concerts in London have taken this\u000a      material to an even wider audience, and the composer plans for this new\u000a      music to be performed in a series of future concerts in the USA. In this\u000a      way, the project has had an impact on the cultural lives of audiences,\u000a      composer and performers by bringing little-known works back into the\u000a      spotlight and creating new, original works within a framework of\u000a      cross-cultural and transhistoric dialogue. The project `stretched the\u000a      musicianship and performance skills' of the singer, inspiring `a number of\u000a      new performance devices' while `cross-discipline discussions' encouraged\u000a      new `critical and reflective thinking about programme development' (S1).\u000a      As for the composer, this `discourse on interpretation, idiomatic writing\u000a      and the visceral physicality of performance', with researcher and\u000a      performer, has led to his `first serious, opus-numberable compositions'\u000a      and offered new ways of thinking about `the compositional process and the\u000a      choice of poetic material' (S2). Audience feedback (S3) highlighted the\u000a      importance of the way in which the academic research was integrated into\u000a      these cultural events in order to `contextualise the text and historical\u000a      setting in comparison with contemporary society', asking `questions which\u000a      have been reiterated by artists to this day', and inspiring the audience\u000a      `to listen differently to the programme'.\u000a    (2) Engagement with school pupils\u000a    Evans ran a cross-curricular project with Scottish Highers pupils of both\u000a      French and Music at a local school, Madras College (2 hrs school visit per\u000a      week, Sept.-Dec. 2012) involving poetic and musical analysis, translation\u000a      and composition, culminating in a concert in the school for 70 younger\u000a      pupils as well as guests from the town (Dec. 2012). The music pupils\u000a      studied a wide range of C19th poems and song settings, inspiring them to\u000a      work on their own compositions; the texts for these compositions emerged\u000a      from Evans' work with the languages pupils, who analysed and translated a\u000a      selection of poems which challenged them to go beyond the narrow\u000a      requirements of their examination curriculum. The concert featured\u000a      readings by the languages pupils of poetry both in the original language\u000a      and translation, and performances by University Music Centre students of\u000a      songs set both by major composers and the school pupils themselves.\u000a      Feedback from pupils and staff alike attests that this activity is\u000a      extremely rewarding for all concerned since, in the terms of the REF\u000a      criteria, it creates and interprets cultural capital in such a way that it\u000a      enriches and expands the imaginations of everyone involved. As the\u000a      teacher's report states, `this interdisciplinary approach exemplifies the\u000a      best modern practice with regard to Curriculum for Excellence, making\u000a      links between subjects in a manner which stimulates a life-long interest'\u000a      (S4).\u000a    (3) Public events: How is aesthetic value constructed? How do we\u000a        consume art?\u000a    Evans has delivered a wide range of public lectures on his research into\u000a      musico-poetics over the last few years, including `Debussy, Banville and\u000a      the Problem with Fixed-Form Poems' at a public event at Gresham College\u000a      (London, 2012), available on YouTube (S6) since August 2012, which has\u000a      attracted 320 views (by 31 July 2013). In St Andrews, he has spoken at the\u000a      Franco-Scottish Society (2008, 2011, 2012), the University Open\u000a      Association (2011), the Music Centre's Summer Organ School lecture series\u000a      (2011), and the international poetry festival StAnza (2013). Furthermore,\u000a      in Dec. 2010 Evans also ran a masterclass on French song (Faur&#233;, Berlioz),\u000a      in conjunction with the University Music Centre, at which high calibre\u000a      professional musicians &#8212; well-known pianist and soprano &#8212; explored\u000a      performance issues with an audience comprising members of the public and\u000a      students of Evans' final year module `Music in C19th French Poetry'. The\u000a      impact of the research in each case was a greater public understanding of\u000a      the powerful social, economic, political, and aesthetic forces which may\u000a      be seen to influence the way in which artists compose, and the ways in\u000a      which audiences respond to those artworks. As one audience member (S5)\u000a      writes, `Bringing students and townspeople together, as Dr Evans has done\u000a      here [...] is a most important and worthwhile exercise', and that these\u000a      events are `backed by serious research of the subject [...] and a real\u000a      desire to make the subject available to an audience of people of varied\u000a      experience and abilities'.\u000a    With these three intertwined strands, this impact study established clear\u000a      links between original academic research into new corpuses and\u000a      methodologies, the wider public, performers and schools, generating new\u000a      interest in languages, translation and music education. The project has\u000a      altered the way its beneficiaries perceive poetry, music and song; offered\u000a      opportunities for rediscovering music and expanding the repertoire;\u000a      allowed for greater dialogue between performers of music and students of\u000a      text; built bridges between music and poetry from diverse contexts around\u000a      a central intellectual theme; and invited the creation and performance of\u000a      new musical works.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This study, based on Dr David Evans' work on C19th French poetry,\u000a      encompasses a wide variety of schools outreach, recordings, concerts,\u000a      workshops and public talks in Scotland and England, bringing practising\u000a      musicians, schools and concert audiences together with academics and\u000a      students, to explore the relationship of words to music, and song as a\u000a      mode of artistic expression and intercultural exchange.

His findings deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind\u000a      the production of works of art, and how those artworks are to be\u000a      interpreted in terms of both aesthetic and economic value. Following the\u000a      French Revolution, as long-held beliefs over absolute values were\u000a      collapsing, aesthetic value was no longer a given; in reaction to\u000a      increasing industrialisation and the commodification of art, poets began\u000a      to define their art in terms which could not be reduced to reproducible\u000a      formulae: namely as music, an art which, paradoxically, is wordless. These\u000a      poems had a profound influence on composers, who either set them to music\u000a      (Faur&#233;, Debussy, Duparc, Poulenc, Britten) or wrote instrumental music\u000a      inspired by them (Debussy's Pr&#233;lude &#224; l'apr&#232;s-midi d'un faune, and\u000a      piano pieces). This research builds on Evans' first monograph Rhythm,\u000a        Illusion and the Poetic Idea (Rodopi, 2004), which showed how the\u000a      revolution in French verse forms of the late C19th illustrated a shift\u000a      away from previous aesthetic certainties and towards an exciting period in\u000a      which artists created art which asked questions of its very status as art.\u000a      Evans has since demonstrated that, when composers such as Debussy and\u000a      Faur&#233; write music inspired by these texts, they create new harmonic worlds\u000a      which encourage similar reflections on the limits of our definition of\u000a      `the musical'. Over the last eight years, Evans has presented this\u000a      research at over twenty international conferences in the UK, France and\u000a      USA, such as the annual meetings of the Society of Dix-Neuvi&#233;mistes and\u000a      the Society for French Studies, including the papers `What Might \"Music\"\u000a      Mean?

This work has been presented in\u000a      Evans' special edition of the internationally recognised\u000a      journal Dix-Neuf dedicated to Banville (2010), 4 book chapters\u000a      (2006-2013) and 14 conference papers.

Questionnaires [corroborating\u000d\u000a      source &#8212; CS6] for the purpose of gauging impact were only introduced in\u000d\u000a      the 8th meeting of the LDA (25.11.11). These directly asked\u000d\u000a      those in attendance if the lectures had made them think differently about\u000d\u000a      the significance of Dante. Responses to this question varied across\u000d\u000a      meetings but generally between 60% and 80% of those who replied had had\u000d\u000a      their ideas about Dante changed in some way. Individual responses testify\u000d\u000a      to the significant contribution of the series to enriching the cultural\u000d\u000a      life of St Andrews. A member of the public who has regularly attended\u000d\u000a      provided an individual statement about his experience [CS1] in which he\u000d\u000a      states `Now thanks to the Lectura I have been able to widen and deepen\u000d\u000a        my understanding of this extraordinary poem'. Another indicative\u000d\u000a      comment left on the LDA facebook page [CS10] states: `The riches we\u000d\u000a        take home each time from these meetings cannot be underestimated. ...\u000d\u000a        The big surprise is how contemporary with ourselves Dante feels.'\u000d\u000a    The Website:\u000d\u000a      An important feature of the lectura tradition is its locality,\u000d\u000a      reflected in the name of each lectura &#8212; romana, turicensis\u000d\u000a      etc. However, since St Andrews is small, and not easily accessible, so\u000d\u000a      that the audience at the lectures is mainly local (although people have\u000d\u000a      also travelled from, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, Leeds, Dublin and Belfast)\u000d\u000a      the website is important to widen access. We decided early on to video\u000d\u000a      record all lectures as a strategy to widen access to the series. Thus\u000d\u000a      video recordings of the lectures are subsequently made available on the\u000d\u000a      LDA website in order to reach a worldwide audience. From September 2011\u000d\u000a      (when the site began) until the 31st of July 2013 it has been\u000d\u000a      visited by people from 707 different cities and towns in 68 different\u000d\u000a      countries worldwide (on all 5 continents) [CS9]. Since there is no general\u000d\u000a      feedback section on the website, this is primarily evidence of\u000d\u000a      geographical reach.\u000d\u000a    The LDA has developed the traditional Lectura Dantis model to\u000d\u000a      include complementary events alongside the lecture series, bringing\u000d\u000a      research on different aspects of Dante's work to bear on contemporary\u000d\u000a      issues and creative activity. The main activities in the census period\u000d\u000a      have been:\u000d\u000a    `The Dante Debate 1 &amp; 2' (22.4.2012 and 29.4.2012). These\u000d\u000a      public discussions on topics of perennial interest used Dante's text as a\u000d\u000a      starting point for consideration of two questions from a variety of\u000d\u000a      perspectives. The first discussion was on the nature of sin and evil; the\u000d\u000a      second on punishment, forgiveness, and redemption. The format of the\u000d\u000a      discussion was a presentation first by one of the LDA organisers (RW) of\u000d\u000a      Dante's view on sin and evil \/ punishment and redemption &#8212; specifically on\u000d\u000a      the moral structures of his imagining of hell and of Purgatory, directly\u000d\u000a      informed by the speaker's current research on this within the LDA. Against\u000d\u000a      this backdrop invited speakers gave a short reflection on this from their\u000d\u000a      perspective, a philosopher, CEO of Sacro (a Community Justice Voluntary\u000d\u000a      Organisation) \/ a lawyer working with The Howard League for Penal Reform\u000d\u000a      Scotland (a Penal Reform charity) \/ the press officer for Victim Support\u000d\u000a      Scotland \/ the Project Manager of Circle (charity working with families of\u000d\u000a      offenders). The discussion was then opened up to the public in a question\u000d\u000a      time format.\u000d\u000a    The impact of these events was to demonstrate how a 14th\u000d\u000a      century Italian text dealt with issues which still confront us today,\u000d\u000a      bringing together a range of speakers and members of the public, with the\u000d\u000a      research questions on Dante's moral structuring of Hell as the central\u000d\u000a      starting point of discussion and reflection. This offered all\u000d\u000a      participants, speakers and the audience drawn from the public, either an\u000d\u000a      entirely new perspective on these issues, or advanced their awareness and\u000d\u000a      understanding of the issues. Held in Glasgow's largest Art Gallery on two\u000d\u000a      Sunday afternoons [CS3b] these events reached a wide public audience as\u000d\u000a      shown in the video recordings of both sessions now on the LDA website\u000d\u000a      [CS9], and questionnaire returns [CS7]. In questionnaires 66% of\u000d\u000a      respondents at the first meeting indicated that the sessions had made them\u000d\u000a      re-think their views on the issues. One respondent commented `You can\u000d\u000a        talk back, it was a live debate'. One of the\u000d\u000a      speakers, the CEO of SACRO (formerly Deputy Chief Constable of Lothian and\u000d\u000a      Borders Police) [CS2] commented both on the personal benefit of\u000d\u000a      participating, `All of this experience enabled me to personally reflect\u000d\u000a        on my life experience and the role I undertake in civic society, with\u000d\u000a        much benefit gained by informing and reinforcing the value base from\u000d\u000a        which I begin', and on the contribution the event made to public\u000d\u000a      awareness, `There was clearly much reflection and indeed some\u000d\u000a        repositioning of attitudes among the sizable audience who attended. One\u000d\u000a        woman approached me at the conclusion and praised the event for bringing\u000d\u000a        a measured and reasoned discussion to a topic that is so often\u000d\u000a        dramatically polarised in the popular media, increasing public anxiety\u000d\u000a        over evil and its place in our society.' In addition the Glasgow\u000d\u000a        Life organisation was a direct beneficiary of this collaboration in\u000d\u000a      which the LDA organised and provided the event. The Learning and Access\u000d\u000a      Curator [CS3] noted that the events met Glasgow Life's social and cultural\u000d\u000a      objectives, and commented in particular `We at Kelvingrove were\u000d\u000a        delighted by the quality of the Lectura Dantis events and were impressed\u000d\u000a        by the number of visitors who attended. Our visitors engaged in a high\u000d\u000a        level with the debates and the debates attracted adults of all ages.'\u000d\u000a    `My Dante'. In collaboration with Stanza 2012 (Scotland's\u000d\u000a      International Poetry Festival), the LDA organised a session on 16.3.2012\u000d\u000a      in St Andrews in which invited speakers and members of the public read and\u000d\u000a      commented on their preferred passages from Dante.

First,\u000d\u000a      the research activity of the organisers (the key researchers) prior to the\u000d\u000a      setting up of the LDA series; second, the lectures (and\u000d\u000a      complementary events), which continuously and simultaneously\u000d\u000a      underpin the impact of the project at every meeting, and subsequently in\u000d\u000a      the published volumes (with the University of Notre Dame Press) which will\u000d\u000a      follow.\u000d\u000a    The key researchers responsible for the LDA are Dr Robert\u000d\u000a        Wilson and Dr Claudia Rossignoli, lecturers in the Italian\u000d\u000a      Department of the School of Modern Languages since 1995 and 2004,\u000d\u000a      respectively. Both have been researching and publishing on Dante and Dante\u000d\u000a      reception over a number of years (detailed in section 3), leading to the\u000d\u000a      LDA project. The analysis of patterns of prophecy and diachronic vs\u000d\u000a      synchronic readings in Dante's Commedia (RW) touches on key issues\u000d\u000a      at the heart of the Lectura Dantis tradition as a critical\u000d\u000a      approach. Research on the Dante commentary tradition (CR) is crucial to\u000d\u000a      the production of new readings, the substance of the LDA. The key\u000d\u000a      researchers have delivered seven of the fifty-two lectures in the LDA\u000d\u000a      series up to July 2013 (almost the half-way point). The lectura on\u000d\u000a      Inferno Canto 11 (RW) discussing the moral basis of Dante's\u000d\u000a      organisation of hell fed directly into the public discussion events in\u000d\u000a      Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery.\u000d\u000a    The Lectura Dantis as a research activity is a traditional format\u000d\u000a      with a 700 year old history, which is well established and recognised in\u000d\u000a      the field of Dante Studies, and in Italian culture more generally.\u000d\u000a      However, it does not fit more traditional models for research in which the\u000d\u000a      normal trajectory is publication, dissemination\/engagement, then impact.\u000d\u000a      The modern format is a series of individual public lectures on all 100\u000d\u000a      cantos of Dante's Divina Commedia, which are subsequently\u000d\u000a      collected and published. Thus the area of research is very precisely\u000d\u000a      circumscribed &#8212; the individual canto of the Commedia &#8212; and takes\u000d\u000a      place within a very clearly defined tradition of study: Dante Studies in\u000d\u000a      general and previous Lecturae of the same canto in particular. It\u000d\u000a      is in the nature of the Lectura that directly related research is\u000d\u000a      followed immediately by public engagement and impact in the lectures\u000d\u000a      themselves, followed afterwards by further dissemination\/public engagement\u000d\u000a      through publication. The impact will be more fully described in\u000d\u000a        section 4, but has to be mentioned here precisely because research and\u000d\u000a        impact are inseparable in this tradition.\u000d\u000a    Within the period to the end of July 2013, the LDA has brought directly\u000d\u000a      to the public thirty-eight speakers from twenty-five different\u000d\u000a      institutions in the USA, Australia, Italy, the UK and Ireland, from some\u000d\u000a      of the most established scholars as well as some of the newest researchers\u000d\u000a      on Dante. In each lecture the public are presented with established ideas\u000d\u000a      alongside new insights and interpretations as varied as the speakers. The\u000d\u000a      series is thus characterised by diversity and a combination of tradition\u000d\u000a      and innovation. The particular format of the LDA adds a new dimension to\u000d\u000a      the research. The lecturae are presented in a series of day-long\u000d\u000a      meetings, normally with four different speakers, concluding with a round\u000d\u000a      table discussion open to the public. There is thus an in-built\u000d\u000a      facilitation of the discussion and shaping of research not just through\u000d\u000a      interaction with other experts but with the general public too.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35302","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Media coverage of Culpin's English translation and critical edition of\u000a      Boniface's Narrative of the Shipwreck of the Eole began even prior\u000a      to the publication and launch of the book, in November 2012, having\u000a      previously featured in articles in the Daily\u000a          Maverick (3\/8\/11,estimated daily readership 237,000), and the\u000a      South African Sunday\u000a          Times (14\/11\/11, estimated weekly readership 3.2 million) [S5].\u000a      These articles disseminated interest in the story so that, by the time the\u000a      book was launched, Culpin's willingness to engage with the public enabled\u000a      the book to have considerable cultural, public and economic impact both in\u000a      South Africa and, to a lesser degree, in Scotland.\u000a    1. Impact on Cultural Life\u000a    Prior to the launch of the book, Culpin was invited by the French\u000a      Institute in South Africa to present the book at the Open Book Festival in\u000a      Cape Town as part of the `French Season in South Africa' in September\u000a      2012. He participated in a public discussion at the Fugard Theatre and a\u000a      presentation at Belville Library before audiences of about three dozen on\u000a      both occasions. The book launch itself took place at the National Library\u000a      in Cape Town on 1\/11\/2012 before an invited audience of about 200 people\u000a      from across South Africa including media, individuals from education, the\u000a      arts and the world of libraries and museums (including the Deputy Head of\u000a      the NLSA). At the launch, two professional South African musicians\u000a      (guitarist and soprano), performed a selection of the music from\u000a      Boniface's Ariettes\u000a      not heard since the early 19th century [S6]. In consequence of this\u000a      discovery Boniface's music also became the basis of a research project\u000a      into `Domestic Music in Cape Town in the 1820s' by the Head of Musicology\u000a      at the University of Cape Town'. The book launch saw the opening of a\u000a      major exhibition at the National Library in Cape Town entitled `Boniface\u000a      and His World: the Cape and Beyond in the 1820s', sponsored by the NLSA.\u000a      Culpin wrote the exhibition guide, and chose the exhibits, including\u000a      manuscript letters and original music arranged by Boniface. In parallel,\u000a      the South African Museum organized an exhibition about the French explorer\u000a      Fran&#231;ois Le Vaillant, and visitors to each exhibition were directed to the\u000a      other, thereby enhancing exposure of the research to the general public.\u000a      The Boniface exhibition ran from 1\/11\/2012 until 31\/3\/2013, during which\u000a      time the Library attracted 14,184 visitors. The French Consul at Cape Town\u000a      writes that Culpin's project `brought about in a masterly way the\u000a      rediscovery and promotion of French culture in South Africa [and] made it\u000a      possible for a large number of people in South Africa to discover the\u000a      French vision of that pre-colonial period, but also to transform their\u000a      perception of the French presence at the Cape in the nineteenth century' [S1].\u000a      The Deputy National Librarian of the NLSA writes of the book that `It did\u000a      not only reveal the literary treasures within in our documentary heritage,\u000a      but succeeded in enriching our history', adding that `The translation of\u000a      the book into English was a major breakthrough'. Her letter concludes, `Dr\u000a      Culpin has left an indelible mark in the field of research and a sense of\u000a      pride in National Library and Information Services'. The interest\u000a      generated by the book launch and exhibition created opportunities to reach\u000a      wider audiences in different parts of South Africa. A second launch of the\u000a      book was held at the Cory Library, part of Rhodes University in\u000a      Grahamstown, which is the national centre for research into the history of\u000a      the Eastern Cape and is located in the area where the events surrounding\u000a      the shipwreck of the Eole took place.\u000a    In Scotland, an exhibition based on Culpin's research was also mounted in\u000a      St Andrews at the Museum of the University of St Andrews (MUSA), organized\u000a      jointly with Special Collections at the University Library, situating\u000a      Boniface's Narrative in the context of travel writers in the long\u000a      18th century. The exhibition ran from January until March 2013 attracting\u000a      3,049 visitors during winter opening times of only 16 hours per week. In\u000a      association with this exhibition, Culpin gave two lectures at MUSA, one to\u000a      a combined meeting of the St Andrews and Perth branches of the\u000a      Franco-Scottish Society, the other to the general public in a lecture\u000a      series organized by MUSA.\u000a    2. Impact on Civic life and Public Discourse\u000a    Culpin's extensive research and immersion into South African life allowed\u000a      him to capture public interest and reveal the relevance of this story to\u000a      modern South Africa, particularly on issues of cultural memory,\u000a      reconciliation and social justice. The book was well received and reviewed\u000a      in the regional and national South African press, including The Herald\u000a      (estimated readership 256,000), and a full-page article (`Gained in\u000a      translation. Rare account of life at the Cape in the 1800s') in the Cape\u000a        Times [S6] (estimated readership 316,000). In order to extend\u000a      the discourse to Afrikaans speakers, Culpin gave a 25 minute interview,\u000a      partially in Afrikaans, on the programme `Skrywersen\u000a        Boeke' (`Writers and Books') broadcast on 5\/12\/2012 on Radio Sonder\u000a      Grense (RSG), the national Afrikaans station (estimated audience 2\u000a      million) [S7]. Culpin also gave the keynote speech launching\u000a      Library Week on 19\/3\/2013 at the NLSA in Pretoria. The event focused on\u000a      the role of libraries in ensuring freedom of information. Approximately\u000a      320 people were present for this event, including diplomats from various\u000a      African countries, lawyers specializing in human rights, representatives\u000a      from libraries across South Africa, and pupils from local schools. The\u000a      Deputy National Librarian of the NLSA writes that Culpin's work is\u000a      important in the context of South Africa's `painful history of oppression\u000a      where land was taken from its original inhabitants' [S2]. She adds\u000a      that, following the publication of this book, `The Amaxhosa can actually\u000a      use this narrative as further proof that their forefathers lived and owned\u000a      land in that area on the 1800s'. Finally, the Chair of the National\u000a      English Literary Museum writes `Having been involved in a variety of South\u000a      African academic and research networks, and with various institutions, I\u000a      can make an unqualified claim: very few scholarly discoveries, and their\u000a      elaboration have been brought to a public's attention as widely and\u000a      significantly as the Boniface narrative.' [S3]\u000a    The primary significance of the book was felt in South Africa, but in\u000a      Scotland it was not without interest. According to questionnaires filled\u000a      in by the audiences attending the talks and visiting the exhibition in St\u000a      Andrews (see above), 100% of respondents agreed that they had been made to\u000a      think differently about the issues discussed, and for 82% this change was\u000a      significant [S8]. The events also attracted an interview with the\u000a      Arts Correspondent of BBC Scotland resulting in an item featured in three\u000a      radio programmes on Tuesday 12 February 2013, namely: Good Morning\u000a      Scotland (BBC Radio Scotland); the John Beattie programme (BBC Radio\u000a      Scotland); and Kingdom FM news. Finally, the project's websites had been\u000a      accessed by more than 1500 visitors from 34 countries on every continent\u000a      by 31\/7\/2013 [S9]. Culpin's work also corrected a major error in\u000a      existing biographies of Boniface, which suggest that one of the survivors\u000a      of the Eole had a child by Boniface's slave, whereas this child was\u000a      Boniface's own. Through these sites Culpin was contacted by the\u000a      great-great-great grandson of that child, and has been able to act as a\u000a      focal point for passing on genealogical details to other descendants of\u000a      the author [S10].\u000a    3. Impact on Education\u000a    In 2013 Culpin gave a series of 20 educational talks at a variety of\u000a      venues. The audiences included historical societies (the Cape Town\u000a      Bibliophiles and the Van Plettenberg Society), branches of the University\u000a      of the Third Age (at George and Plettenberg Bay), the Institut Fran&#231;ais\u000a      (in Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg), and Nelson Mandela Metropolitan\u000a      University. In addition, and in part within the schools outreach programme\u000a      organized by the National English Literary Museum in Grahamstown, Culpin\u000a      addressed pupils at two French Lyc&#233;es (Cape Town and\u000a      Johannesburg), two Afrikaans-speaking schools (in Pretoria), one\u000a      English-speaking High School, and one Xhosa-speaking High School in a\u000a      township (both in Grahamstown). This opportunity was particularly valuable\u000a      because, since the change of government in 1994, history teaching in High\u000a      Schools has focused on the apartheid years. Colonial history has only\u000a      recently returned to the syllabus and teachers were therefore grateful for\u000a      input in this field. According to the Chair of the National English\u000a      Literary Museum in South Africa: `Historical manuscripts, no matter how\u000a      important, are difficult to publicize and disseminate. The time that Prof.\u000a      Culpin has spent in South Africa has been immeasurably important in this\u000a      regard. Accompanied by the Museum's education\/outreach officer, he visited\u000a      one of the underprivileged schools outside Grahamstown, and spoke to a\u000a      large group of learners. Apart from this occasion Prof. Culpin has spoken\u000a      to six other schools. These are diverse in their constituencies, ranging\u000a      from the most established and best known South African schools, to some in\u000a      emerging areas. A conservative estimate would be that he addressed [...]\u000a      about 1500 South African learners between the ages of 13 and 18. Given the\u000a      limited readership of an academic article, this public - especially in a\u000a      context in which redress is so significant - suggests a considerable and\u000a      unique endeavour on Prof. Culpin's part.' [S3]\u000a    4. Economic Impact\u000a    Proceeds of the book sales go to the NLSA, and the Deputy National\u000a      Librarian writes: `The bookshops and the general public have shown great\u000a      interest. We continue to receive orders from [...] as far as Netherlands.\u000a      Arrangements are underway to sell the book online.' [S2]. Economic\u000a      impact has also been achieved through the promotion of tourism in the\u000a      Eastern Cape since, after 18 months of research, Culpin was able to\u000a      identify the site where the Eole was shipwrecked, at Sandy Point.\u000a      Subsequently, in conjunction with the Wavecrest Hotel (which overlooks the\u000a      spot where the shipwreck occurred), he obtained permission from the\u000a      Provincial Government of the Eastern Cape to erect a commemorative\u000a      monument at the site. This was unveiled on 11\/6\/2013 by the French Consul\u000a      at the Cape on behalf of the French Ambassador to South Africa, in the\u000a      presence of the Deputy-Head of the NLSA, chiefs of the local Xhosa\u000a      community, the Methodist bishop of the Eastern Cape, representatives of\u000a      the Department of Parks and Tourism (who are featuring the site in their\u000a      international promotional material), and the press, leading to full-page\u000a      articles in the Weekend Dispatch (readership 148,000) and The\u000a          Witness (readership 171,000) which cover the entire eastern\u000a      half of South Africa [S11]. The Wavecrest Hotel now gives\u000a      prominence to Culpin's research on its website\u000a      and the economic impact is confirmed by the hotel's Assistant Manager who\u000a      writes: `When I [...] learned from Dr Culpin that the site of our hotel\u000a      [...] was within sight of the spot where the Eole was wrecked I\u000a      immediately saw the commercial opportunities that this offered, and was\u000a      keen to associate the Wavecrest Hotel with the project' [S4]. He\u000a      confirms that officials of the Provincial Government of the Eastern Cape\u000a      `also recognized the importance of this project', adding: `We have already\u000a      had keen interest shown by guests that have visited, who have [...] read\u000a      articles in the newspaper. These articles have directly translated into\u000a      some accommodation bookings already.' Visitors to the site can enjoy an Eole\u000a        on Rocks, the cocktail (named in honour of the wreck) that is now\u000a      served at the hotel [S2].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research has had a significant influence on: (1) cultural life,\u000a      through a major exhibition at the National Library in Cape Town and\u000a      promotion of forgotten French cultural heritage in the Cape; (2) civic\u000a        life and public discourse, through a major series of talks, as\u000a      keynote speaker at a public event organized by the National Library of\u000a      South Africa (NLSA) focused on cultural memory, commemoration and\u000a      reconciliation, press coverage and radio broadcasts in the UK and South\u000a      Africa; (3) education, through visits to secondary schools; and\u000a      (4) economic prosperity, through the promotion of tourism in the\u000a      Eastern Cape of South Africa.\u000a\u0009  \u000a\u0009  `New Chapter for Forgotten Shipwreck' (Eastern Province Herald, 12 June\u000a      2013)\u000a\u0009  \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of St Andrews\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"St Andrews (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of St Andrews","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007803}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2853209","Name":"Plettenberg"},{"GeoNamesId":"3874787","Name":"Punta Arenas"},{"GeoNamesId":"1000501","Name":"Grahamstown"},{"GeoNamesId":"2063523","Name":"Perth"},{"GeoNamesId":"964712","Name":"Plettenberg Bay"},{"GeoNamesId":"993800","Name":"Joburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"964137","Name":"Pretoria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1085593","Name":"Eastern Cape"},{"GeoNamesId":"993800","Name":"Johannesburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"3369157","Name":"Cape Town"},{"GeoNamesId":"964420","Name":"Port Elizabeth"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Culpin (in post since 1995),\u000a      Reader in French at the University of St Andrews, principally in Special\u000a      Collections at King's College London and the NLSA in Cape Town between\u000a      October 2009 and January 2012. The underpinning research relates to the\u000a      discovery of an important but forgotten French text, the Narrative of\u000a        the Shipwreck of the Eole by C.E. Boniface, originally published in\u000a      Cape Town in 1829. The narrative is concerned with the equally forgotten\u000a      shipwreck of a French vessel in the Eastern Cape earlier that year, and\u000a      tells the story of the survivors' walk, barefoot and without food, through\u000a      200 miles of unknown territory until they reached Cape Colony, and it is\u000a      completed by a description of their reactions to life in Cape Town.\u000a    In 2009 South African academics, recognizing Culpin's expertise on the\u000a      reception of French literature in 19th-century anglophone\u000a      colonies, suggested that he examine early South African collections now in\u000a      the Special Collections of the NLSA. In 2010 an exploratory grant (R2a)\u000a      made possible initial research at the NLSA during which Culpin unearthed 5\u000a      of the 9 extant copies of the Boniface text. His attention was drawn to\u000a      the document due to the fact that it was published in French in Cape Town\u000a      in 1829, at a time when the official languages were English and Dutch, and\u000a      that no copies were held in the British Library, the Biblioth&#232;que\u000a      Nationale and other major international libraries. On the strength of\u000a      these indicators, a larger grant (R2b) allowed further research in\u000a      2010, and Culpin began learning Afrikaans in order to read the few\u000a      scholarly works dedicated to Boniface written in that language. This\u000a      research showed that: (1) this is the first French book and the first\u000a      travel narrative to have been published in South Africa; (2) it is one of\u000a      a very small number of texts to describe encounters between Europeans and\u000a      the indigenous African population; (3) it offers a rare and very early\u000a      portrait of locations in South Africa that, in 1829, were recently founded\u000a      settlements but are now major centres; (4) it provides a unique commentary\u000a      on important political changes introduced by the English government in the\u000a      1820s into the administration of the Colony; and (5) it includes\u000a      biographical information about the French author who was a leading figure\u000a      in the literary and musical life of Cape Town in the 1820s, and gives an\u000a      insight into the literary and intellectual culture that underpins this\u000a      text and his other writings. Research continued in 2011 (R2c &amp;\u000a      R2d) when Culpin prepared a critical edition, incorporating an\u000a      English translation of the text, plus notes and scholarly apparatus. In\u000a      2011 The NLSA decided to publish the book [R1a] because it made\u000a      available for the first time this important piece of South African history\u000a      and culture. The original French version was republished shortly\u000a      thereafter in January 2013, with Culpin's French translation of his\u000a      critical apparatus (R1b) by the Modern Languages Research\u000a      Association, thus making available a valuable addition to the vast travel\u000a      literature of the early 19th century, only about 7% of which deals with\u000a      Africa.\u000a    Additional material about Boniface that Culpin unearthed during his\u000a      research is made freely available on the internet on a St\u000a        Andrews webpage, WordPress,\u000a      YouTube,\u000a      SoundCloud and Facebook.\u000a      This includes important but forgotten musical items written by Boniface,\u000a      notably his collection of Ariettes,\u000a      which expand upon the musical references included in the shipwreck\u000a      narrative.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36238","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Prior to this research, the Allied bombing of France had received little\u000d\u000a      formal discussion within France. The research has therefore raised\u000d\u000a      critical awareness among French people of the ambiguities and effects of\u000d\u000a      the Allied bombing of their country. This has happened at a time when\u000d\u000a      memories of World War II have been gaining in salience as the generation\u000d\u000a      that lived through it approach the end of their lives. Equally, the\u000d\u000a      effects of Allied bombing on France had been marginalised from most\u000d\u000a      military histories of the war.\u000d\u000a    Within this general perspective, the main impact of this research has\u000d\u000a      been threefold.\u000d\u000a    (a) Among French television producers\u000d\u000a    Firstly, the growing public interest in these events in France stimulated\u000d\u000a      French television documentary makers to invest in documentaries on the\u000d\u000a      subject. The first, Dominique Monteiro, contacted Knapp after finding the\u000d\u000a      Le Havre article on the internet; the second, Catherine Monfajon, did the\u000d\u000a      same after similarly finding the Dodd\/Knapp article. The first programme\u000d\u000a      was broadcast on FR3's regional and national networks (September\/November\u000d\u000a      2012 &#8212; audience of over 300,000), and the second on prime time national TV\u000d\u000a      (to be broadcast in May 2014). Knapp's research was key to the successful\u000d\u000a      production of these documentaries: `He has brought to the film the\u000d\u000a      knowledge of a historian, distancing the story from the emotions it\u000d\u000a      carries and placing it within a wider context' (Producer, October 2012);\u000d\u000a      `I think that without him, it would have been extremely difficult to move\u000d\u000a      forward with any confidence in this ambitious film in which it was vital\u000d\u000a      to have a robust historical framework ... in order to tell the public this\u000d\u000a      extremely important but delicate history with the greatest possible\u000d\u000a      accuracy' (Director, October 2012). In both cases, the research performed\u000d\u000a      an empowering function, ensuring that the producer and director could rely\u000d\u000a      on a firm and impartial basis of historical knowledge. The Producer is\u000d\u000a      currently in discussion with a second documentary maker with a view to\u000d\u000a      preparing a film on Le Havre, again with Knapp's close involvement.\u000d\u000a    (b) Among the US military\u000d\u000a    The second major impact of this research has been on the teachers of\u000d\u000a      military officers at the US Army Command and General Staff College, Fort\u000d\u000a      Leavenworth, Kansas. The analysis of the bombing of `friendly'\u000d\u000a      populations, victims of collateral damage as enemy military objectives are\u000d\u000a      targeted, has relevance for twenty-first century conflicts such as those\u000d\u000a      in Iraq and Afghanistan: liberal democracies typically claim to fight wars\u000d\u000a      to further the well-being of foreign peoples &#8212; whom they nevertheless bomb\u000d\u000a      and kill in the course of military operations. A Professor of the US Army\u000d\u000a      Command and General Staff College first contacted Knapp after the\u000d\u000a      publication of the article on Le Havre; since then his pupils have been\u000d\u000a      stimulated by it to integrate the perspectives of civilians into their\u000d\u000a      courses on planning for military operations. `I routinely assign (Knapp's)\u000d\u000a      narrative of the bombing of Le Havre to illustrate the effects of poor\u000d\u000a      planning to my mid-grade officers, all who will serve as planners at\u000d\u000a      senior headquarters following graduation' (October 2012). As one of these\u000d\u000a      students reported, the research `has made a difference in my life in the\u000d\u000a      way that I think of war and more importantly, how to think about the\u000d\u000a      effects of war' (US Air Force Major, May 2010).\u000d\u000a    (c) Among `live' French audiences, including survivors of bombing\u000d\u000a    Pre-publication circulation of Knapp's article `The Destruction and\u000d\u000a      Liberation of Le Havre in Modern Memory' led to an invitation to speak at\u000d\u000a      a French Defence Ministry conference in June 2007, which included\u000d\u000a      academics and survivors of bombing, and thence to a publication of a\u000d\u000a      French version of the piece. Subsequent public lectures and talks (the Le\u000d\u000a      Havre Historical Research Centre, June 2010; the M&#233;morial de Caen, March\u000d\u000a      2012, Marseille municipal archives, October 2013) brought together those\u000d\u000a      interested in the Second World War French bombing experience, giving\u000d\u000a      members of the French public &#8212; often survivors of the events, or\u000d\u000a      second-generation relatives of these survivors &#8212; an exceptional\u000d\u000a      opportunity to place their own personal and local memories in a broader\u000d\u000a      historical framework. Le Havre's local paper (Presse Havraise, 30\u000d\u000a      June 2010) reported on a lecture given by Knapp attended by over 150\u000d\u000a      people, mostly in their fifties or older, noting the strong participation\u000d\u000a      of survivors in the discussions. The head of the Le Havre Historical\u000d\u000a      Research Centre noted that Knapp's `methodical and quantitative history,\u000d\u000a      founded on both French and British archives', impressed an audience which\u000d\u000a      was also `moved by this sensitive subject' (Wuthrick, October 2012).\u000d\u000a      Similarly, and given the continuing political sensitivities of the\u000d\u000a      subject, the Director of the M&#233;morial de Caen pointed out how vital it had\u000d\u000a      been to demonstrate publicly that a British historian was undertaking this\u000d\u000a      work, `so that at last the public in Normandy, who suffered so much as a\u000d\u000a      result of Anglo-American bombing, can talk freely with a British\u000d\u000a      historian' (Simonnet, October 2012). For these groups, the research was an\u000d\u000a      acknowledgement of their suffering from a citizen of one of the nations\u000d\u000a      that inflicted it: not an apology, but a statement that if the Allies had\u000d\u000a      had their reasons, those did not justify each and every raid.

First,\u000d\u000a      although it was partly concerned with the strategies of the belligerent\u000d\u000a      powers undertaking the bombing, its chief focus was on how the states and\u000d\u000a      the peoples on the receiving end coped. Thus although some archival\u000d\u000a      research was done at the National Archives, Kew, most was undertaken in\u000d\u000a      Paris, and (above all) in French provincial towns. In addition, a doctoral\u000d\u000a      student working on the project under Knapp's supervision (Lindsey Dodd)\u000d\u000a      conducted interviews with survivors of bombing. Second, the research\u000d\u000a      broadened the coverage from the (relatively) familiar stories of the Blitz\u000d\u000a      and of the Allied offensive against Germany, to include the less\u000d\u000a      well-known cases of France and Italy. Third, the project took a\u000d\u000a      comparative approach throughout. It found that many of the experiences of\u000d\u000a      European peoples under air attack were very similar, as were the\u000d\u000a      challenges faced by governments, in terms of protecting civilian\u000d\u000a      populations and providing relief for bombed-out households. However, their\u000d\u000a      success in meeting these challenges depended on the solidity and\u000d\u000a      legitimacy of the state machinery.\u000d\u000a    Knapp's major contribution to the project was a comparative study,\u000d\u000a      undertaken with the other co-investigator Claudia Baldoli (University of\u000d\u000a      Newcastle) and based on archival research, of the French and Italian\u000d\u000a      cases. The major findings of the research were as follows.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The Allies dropped a quantity of bombs on France and Italy greatly\u000d\u000a        exceeding the tonnage dropped by the Luftwaffe on the UK, and amounting,\u000d\u000a        altogether, to over one-third of the total Allied bombing effort on\u000d\u000a        Europe in World War 2.\u000d\u000a      The civilian death toll, amounting to nearly 60,000 in each country,\u000d\u000a        was comparable to that sustained in the UK as a result of German\u000d\u000a        bombing. The material damage was considerably greater, with some\u000d\u000a        localities suffering in excess of 80% destruction.\u000d\u000a      The historiography of the war years in each country, dominated by a\u000d\u000a        narrative in which liberation by the Allies in partnership with national\u000d\u000a        resistance forces is a climax, tends to marginalise the cross-cutting\u000d\u000a        story of bombing, which inevitably presents the Allies in a less\u000d\u000a        favourable light.\u000d\u000a      The Allies did show concern to avoid civilian casualties and\u000d\u000a        unnecessary damage, but military necessity &#8212; real or perceived &#8212; usually\u000d\u000a        trumped these concerns. In addition, senior Allied military figures\u000d\u000a        admitted privately that some raids had been unnecessary.\u000d\u000a      Of the two states, Vichy France responded more effectively than\u000d\u000a        Fascist Italy. In France, though often hampered by scarce resources,\u000d\u000a        efforts to provide shelters, to maintain basic services, and to look\u000d\u000a        after bombed-out families continued almost to the fall of Vichy. In\u000d\u000a        Italy, the state apparatus often fell apart after really major raids and\u000d\u000a        proved incapable of implementing consistent policies towards, for\u000d\u000a        example, evacuation.\u000d\u000a      French civil society, like the French state, proved the more\u000d\u000a        resistant, demonstrating rather greater cohesion and solidarity than the\u000d\u000a        Italians, and without necessarily supporting the Vichy regime.\u000d\u000a      In both countries, the bombing generated contradictory reactions,\u000d\u000a        including hopes for a speedy end to the war, but also fierce resentment\u000d\u000a        of the Allies after the heavier raids, which the Resistance movements in\u000d\u000a        France and Italy found increasingly hard to justify. In neither case,\u000d\u000a        however, did Allied bombing significantly increase support either for\u000d\u000a        the German occupiers or for the Vichy or Fascist authorities.\u000d\u000a      In present-day international law, at least some raids on France and\u000d\u000a        Italy would be considered as war crimes because, while directed against\u000d\u000a        military targets, they caused disproportionate and foreseeable\u000d\u000a        destruction to civilian lives and property.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Dodd (now a lecturer at the University of Huddersfield) completed her\u000d\u000a      thesis in 2011 on the topic of `Children under the Allied Bombs: France\u000d\u000a      1940-1945'.

The\u000d\u000a      tacit assumption seemed to be that most international wars are fought with\u000d\u000a      allies, and against enemies, who obligingly speak our own language.

In specific terms, the research pointed to :\u000d\u000a    - The need to recognise and problematise the role of translation in\u000d\u000a      intelligence gathering and assessment;\u000d\u000a    - The importance of languages in developing satisfactory relationships\u000d\u000a      between military interveners and civilian populations;\u000d\u000a    - Weaknesses in the language policies which military authorities\u000d\u000a      typically make for war, particularly in their plans to recruit and deploy\u000d\u000a      language\/cultural mediators;\u000d\u000a    - The vulnerabilities of locally recruited interpreters in war and the\u000d\u000a      relative lack of professional and welfare structures to protect them\u000d\u000a      during and after the particular conflict;\u000d\u000a    - The role which languages play in post-conflict peace building and\u000d\u000a      refugee relief.\u000d\u000a    This latter point was further developed through the establishment of a\u000d\u000a      network to explore the role of languages for humanitarian organisations\u000d\u000a      operating in conflict areas, Languages and International NGOs:\u000d\u000a        Cultural Knowledge in Communities in Crisis (supported by an AHRC\u000d\u000a      Translating Cultures Development Grant, 2012; PI Footitt, CI Dr. Vanessa\u000d\u000a      Pupavac, Nottingham).

His first book &#8212; La\u000a        mafia durante il fascismo (1986) &#8212; on the campaign of the fascist\u000a      regime against the Sicilian mafia,\u000a      was the focus of a national debate after being reviewed in the Corriere\u000a        della Sera (10\/1\/1987 and\u000a      26\/1\/1987) by the writer and politician Leonardo Sciascia. To mark the\u000a      twentieth anniversary of the\u000a      national debate it had generated the book was reissued in 2007 with\u000a      Sciascia's articles and an\u000a      essay by the writer Gaetano Savatteri. Duggan's study of Francesco Crispi,\u000a      Creare la nazione (`To\u000a      create the nation'), published first in Italian in 2000, received much\u000a      media coverage, especially in\u000a      relation to what were perceived as being Italy's ongoing problems with\u000a      establishing a stable nation-\u000a      state. Extensive reviews appeared in e.g. La Stampa (14\/1\/2001), Avvenire\u000a      (14\/1\/2001), Il\u000a        Gazzettino (21\/1\/2001), Corriere della Sera (30\/1\/2001), Sole\u000a        24 Ore (18\/2\/2001), La Repubblica\u000a      (6\/4\/2001), The newspaper Il Giornale, owned by Silvio\u000a      Berlusconi's brother, sought (29\/7\/2001;\u000a      author's reply 22\/9\/2001) to suggest that the book demonstrated that only\u000a      a charismatic leader\u000a      could unite the country. One of the central themes of the book &#8212; the\u000a      relationship between nation-\u000a      building and war &#8212; aroused strong reactions (e.g. the review by Giuseppe\u000a      Giarrizzo, L'Acropoli,\u000a      August 2002, which objected furiously to the idea that Crispi had an\u000a      aggressive foreign policy). For\u000a      responses to the book &#8212; and the issue of nation-building and war in\u000a      particular &#8212; in the UK, see, for\u000a      instance the long review in the TLS, 2 May 2003 (pp. 3-5).\u000a    Duggan's book, The Force of Destiny, was published in Italy in\u000a      November 2008. It was the subject\u000a      of an hour-long public debate with the author on state national television\u000a      (RaiUno) on the evening\u000a      of 5 December 2008. Hosted by the journalist Gianni Riotta, the studio\u000a      audience included\u000a      academics and writers (Sergio Luzzatto, Franco Cardini, Vincenzo Mollica,\u000a      Karima Moual) as well\u000a      as members of the public. There were also interventions from politicians\u000a      such as the Minister of\u000a      Defence, Ignazio La Russa. The book was discussed in a series of public\u000a      events from 27-30\u000a      January 2009. In Rome it was presented by the former prime minister,\u000a      Giuliano Amato, and former\u000a      Minister of Education Tullio De Mauro, and debated with the author by some\u000a      forty historians. In\u000a      Turin the public debate was led by the editor of La Repubblica,\u000a      Ezio Mauro and in Milan by the\u000a      historian and diplomat, Sergio Romano. There were twenty-two newspaper\u000a      reviews of the book\u000a      and several articles and interviews (e.g., La Repubblica,\u000a      25\/11\/2008, Corriere della Sera,\u000a      30\/1\/2009). At the Estoria festival in Gorizia on 24\/5\/2009 the author\u000a      discussed the themes of the\u000a      book in a charged atmosphere with the writer and historian Ernesto Galli\u000a      della Loggia. Galli Della\u000a      Loggia claimed subsequently, in an editorial in the Corriere della\u000a        Sera (7\/1\/2011), that the book\u000a      was damaging Italy's international standing by presenting a `caricature'\u000a      of the country's history.\u000a      The first edition of the book (6,000 in hardback) sold out in six weeks. A\u000a      new paperback edition\u000a      was brought out in 2011 to mark the 150th anniversary of\u000a      Italian unification. In recognition of the\u000a      author's contribution to the study of Italian history, the President of\u000a      the Italian Republic, Giorgio\u000a      Napolitano, conferred on him the title of Commendatore in 2008. The\u000a      President and his Diplomatic\u000a      Adviser, Ambassador Stefano Stefanini, discussed the book personally with\u000a      Duggan at a meeting\u000a      in Oxford on 29 June 2011.\u000a    Impact on public understanding of Italian history and its present-day\u000a        relevance\u000a      In the UK Duggan's work has engaged with audiences beyond university\u000a      circles.

Duggan\u000a      was invited by the BBC to work with the journalist Misha Glenny on a\u000a      forthcoming series (starting\u000a      14\/10\/13) for Radio 4 on Italian history (`The Invention of Italy').\u000a    Duggan's more recent research on fascism &#8212; exploring the role of the cult\u000a      of the Duce in the\u000a      process of nationalisation in the inter-war years &#8212; has been disseminated\u000a      through three\u000a      documentary films (screened in the UK and Italy) and an exhibition at the\u000a      Estorick Collection in\u000a      London (22 September - 19 December 2010: 4,850 visitors). A film of this\u000a      exhibition, with\u000a      commentary, is available on: www.youtube.com\/user\/mussoliniexhibition.\u000a    Duggan is also frequently asked by national newspapers in the UK and\u000a      Italy for articles or\u000a      interviews on aspects of contemporary Italy and how current problems\u000a      relate to broader historical\u000a      trends.

This work challenged a\u000a      common view that fascism\u000a      had been successful in tackling organised crime and highlighted the depth\u000a      of problems faced by\u000a      the Italian state in establishing its authority.\u000a    Duggan explored the theme of the relationship between state and society\u000a      further in his research\u000a      into the career of Francesco Crispi (1818-1901), carried out between 1990\u000a      and 1999. As with the\u000a      research on the mafia, he found his work raised questions about what Italy\u000a      chose to remember (or\u000a      not remember) about its past in ways that impacted on current political\u000a      debates.\u000a    The study of Crispi involved extensive archive work in a number of\u000a      countries. It was the first full-\u000a      length academic biography of this key political figure in 19th century\u000a      Europe. It showed how\u000a      Crispi's long career hinged on his concern to effect `moral' as well as\u000a      `material' cohesion and unity\u000a      in Italy and underscored the preoccupation of the Italian elites with\u000a      nation-building. The sense of\u000a      how fragmented Italy was (culturally and economically, for example),\u000a      combined with the realisation\u000a      that unification in 1860 had not commanded widespread support, left the\u000a      country's leaders acutely\u000a      conscious of the need to generate a sense of patriotism and commitment to\u000a      the institutions of the\u000a      state (such as parliament and the crown). The research examined the\u000a      various instruments that\u000a      were deployed in trying to construct a national community in Italy: the\u000a      development of collective\u000a      memories, the creation of national icons (e.g. the king, Garibaldi), the\u000a      army (as well as schools) as\u000a      a tool for educating the masses, and engagement in an expansionist and\u000a      aggressive foreign policy.\u000a      The stress in the research on the pursuit of war as a tool of national\u000a      integration challenged long-\u000a      held assumptions about the character of the Italian liberal state.\u000a    The theme of nation-building in Italy was expanded to the entirety of\u000a      Italian history from the French\u000a      revolution to the present in the research Duggan undertook in 2001-6 for\u000a      his book The Force of\u000a      Destiny (2007). This work explored how Italy's ruling classes set about\u000a      trying to create the kind of\u000a      national community envisaged by patriots in the Risorgimento, and\u000a      indicated that these efforts at\u000a      nation building culminated in the fascist experiment of the 1920s and\u000a      1930s. The final part of the\u000a      book looked at the situation in Italy since 1945 and suggested that the\u000a      nationalising impulses that\u000a      had driven Italian history since the 19th century had been severely\u000a      attenuated with a resultant\u000a      weakening of the nexus between nation and state and between public and\u000a      private values.\u000a    Much of Duggan's recent research (2006-12) was conducted within the\u000a      framework of a multi-\u000a      disciplinary AHRC-funded project The Cult of the Duce: Mussolini and the\u000a      Italians, 1918-2005 (for\u000a      which he was Co-I). It looked in detail at how the fascist regime set out\u000a      to generate a sense of a\u000a      national community. Using unpublished private diaries and letters, it\u000a      investigated to what extent\u000a      and why fascism resonated with ordinary Italians. It suggested that the\u000a      cult of the charismatic\u000a      leader, and the deployment of emotionally charged religious categories\u000a      such as `faith' and\u000a      `sacrifice', were successful in generating the kind of cohesion that had\u000a      eluded the country in\u000a      previous decades.\u000a    Duggan joined the University as a Lecturer in 1987 and became a Professor\u000a      in 2002.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36979","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"174982","Name":"Armenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"272103","Name":"Lebanon"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research has had significant and wide-reaching impact for a\u000d\u000a      relatively small amount of research funding (a total of &#163;24,381 over 2\u000d\u000a      awards).

However, knowledge\u000d\u000a      and understanding of policy, practice and challenges in areas such as\u000d\u000a      training, materials, and classroom conditions is at best sketchy. This\u000d\u000a      project, focusing on young learners aged 7-11, therefore aimed to:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      discover what policy\/syllabus documents inform TEYL practices around\u000d\u000a        the world;\u000d\u000a      investigate and map the major pedagogies that teachers use;\u000d\u000a      better understand teachers' perceptions of their roles and\u000d\u000a        responsibilities, including the challenges they face;\u000d\u000a      identify how local solutions to pedagogical issues can be effective\u000d\u000a        and how these may resonate globally;\u000d\u000a      develop an innovative research tool for transnational research with\u000d\u000a        limited funding.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Two research methods were used. A survey, using opportunity sampling,\u000d\u000a      resulted in 4,446 responses from primary school teachers in over 140\u000d\u000a      countries with responses from all continents. Five case studies,\u000d\u000a      comprising interviews with teachers and classroom observations, were\u000d\u000a      carried out in Colombia, Italy, Korea, Tanzania and the UAE. Data were\u000d\u000a      analysed using a number of tools including a predictive analysis to\u000d\u000a      identify key variables that influence classroom practice (survey closed\u000d\u000a      questions), corpus analysis to classify the range of challenges teachers\u000d\u000a      face (survey open questions) and coding (interviews) to identify\u000d\u000a      cross-contextual themes.\u000d\u000a    Major findings (linked to publications in S3)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The predictive analyses revealed a complex picture in which a number\u000d\u000a        of significant factors influencing practice were identified. These were\u000d\u000a        geographical location, age of learners, and teachers' level of English\u000d\u000a        proficiency.\u000d\u000a      Classroom practices are influenced less by pedagogical theories\u000d\u000a        underpinning government policies and more by the materials and resources\u000d\u000a        available (S3.1).\u000d\u000a      While teachers' practices are framed within government or\u000d\u000a        institutional policy documents and many are aware of them, the most\u000d\u000a        influential documents reported to underpin practices are the coursebook\u000d\u000a        and teachers' own lesson plans (S3.1).\u000d\u000a      Teachers of young learners face challenges that are generally\u000d\u000a        neglected in the young learner literature. Teaching speaking, motivating\u000d\u000a        learners, dealing with large classes, mixed levels and discipline\u000d\u000a        problems were all identified by teachers as particularly challenging\u000d\u000a        (S3.4,S3.5).\u000d\u000a      Teachers themselves are clearly important agents in developing local\u000d\u000a        solutions to the demands of teaching young learners. Observed practices\u000d\u000a        included varying the activities during a single lesson, using different\u000d\u000a        visual and aural resources, introducing meaningful local cultural\u000d\u000a        artefacts, activities that recycle language points, using strategies to\u000d\u000a        control discipline and maintain attention and motivation, and planning\u000d\u000a        for short concentration spans (S31, S3.2, S3.4).\u000d\u000a      Previous research has focused on teachers' lack of English\u000d\u000a        proficiency. However, this research has shown a far more complex picture\u000d\u000a        in which confidence, attitude, the role of native speaker teachers and\u000d\u000a        the persistent view that achieving native speaker competence is\u000d\u000a        necessary all influence classroom practice (S3.1, S3.2, S3.4, S3.5).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36980","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1821275","Name":"Macao"},{"GeoNamesId":"1821275","Name":"Macao"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Professor Sch&#228;ffner's research on translation competence development has\u000a      had an impact above\u000a      all on policy makers and institutions in the European Union by providing\u000a      expert advice and thereby\u000a      influencing policy and practice.\u000a    Transforming policy\u000a      As a result of the underpinning research cited above, Professor Sch&#228;ffner\u000a      was invited in 2007 by\u000a      the European Commission's Directorate General for Translation (DGT) to be\u000a      a member of an\u000a      Expert Group for the European Master's in Translation (EMT) project. This\u000a      Expert Group consisted\u000a      of eight members from several European countries.

This initiative was motivated by the difficulty the DGT\u000a      experienced in hiring qualified\u000a      translators. The Expert Group worked intensively between 2008 and 2009 on\u000a      producing\u000a      documentation for the DGT, the most important one outlining the Translator\u000a      Competence Profile\u000a      (see S5.1) This profile document specifies competences translators need to\u000a      have in order to work\u000a      successfully in the field of multilingual and multimedia communication.\u000a      The underpinning research\u000a      cited above (especially S3.1, S3.5) contributed to the development of this\u000a      competence profile,\u000a      which was adopted by the DGT in 2009.\u000a    Since its adoption, the Translator Competence Profile has served as a\u000a      benchmark for postgraduate\u000a      programmes applying to be admitted to the EMT network. With more than 90\u000a      applications from\u000a      across Europe in the first round in 2009, 34 programmes were admitted to\u000a      the network. There were\u000a      a further 64 applications in the second round in 2010\/11, of which 20\u000a      programmes were admitted\u000a      (bringing the current total to 54 programmes from 20 countries). The\u000a      profile document also serves\u000a      as a guideline for universities across Europe that wish to develop\u000a      translator training programmes.\u000a      The DGT invited Professor Sch&#228;ffner to be a member of the evaluation\u000a      committee for applications\u000a      to join the EMT Network for both rounds (2009, 2011).\u000a    In 2010 Professor Sch&#228;ffner was invited to become a member of the\u000a      OPTIMALE Steering\u000a      Committee (Optimising professional translator training in a multilingual\u000a      Europe, see S5.2), an\u000a      Erasmus academic network funded by the Directorate-General for Education\u000a      and Culture (total\u000a      grant of &#8364;249,904.00).

In November 2010,\u000a      she gave a plenary talk\u000a      at the 6th Asian Translators Forum of FIT (F&#233;d&#233;ration Internationale des\u000a      Traducteurs), held at the\u000a      University of Macao on the topic `Translation Competence &#8212; Training for\u000a      the Real World' (S5.3).\u000a      The audience included researchers, trainers of translators, professional\u000a      translators, and\u000a      representatives of education ministries from China and other Asian\u000a      countries.

An\u000a      increasing translation volume poses challenges to specifying quality\u000a      criteria for translation services,\u000a      in particular because the translation profession is not regulated. The\u000a      translation industry, and also\u000a      the EU institutions, have experienced difficulties in recruiting qualified\u000a      translators which has\u000a      highlighted the need to establish criteria for defining and assessing\u000a      translation competence and\u000a      thus raise the standard of translator training.\u000a    The research conducted by Christina Sch&#228;ffner, Professor of Translation\u000a      Studies, and employed at\u000a      Aston University since 1992, has been devoted to translation competence\u000a      and its development.\u000a      Her initial work was concerned with investigating the nature of\u000a      translation competence (S3.1).\u000a      Based predominantly on critical engagement with literature on this topic,\u000a      translation competence\u000a      was defined as complex and consisting of sub-competences, viz\u000a    \u000a      \u000atranslation service provision competence &#8212; the ability to\u000a        produce and offer a translation\u000a        appropriate to client specification;\u000a      \u000alinguistic competence &#8212; knowledge of the languages concerned,\u000a        comprising communicative\u000a        competence and metalinguistic competence;\u000a      \u000aintercultural competence &#8212; general knowledge of historical,\u000a        political, economic and cultural\u000a        contexts and other aspects of the respective countries and communities;\u000a      \u000atextual competence &#8212; knowledge of regularities and conventions\u000a        of texts, genres, text types;\u000a      \u000athematic competence &#8212; knowledge of the relevant subject, the\u000a        area of expertise;\u000a      \u000a(re)search competence &#8212; a general strategic competence whose\u000a        aim is the ability to resolve\u000a        problems as prerequisite for decision-making, including the ability to\u000a        use tools and search\u000a        engines effectively\u000a    \u000a    As a result of ongoing research (esp. Research outputs S3.5, S3.6),\u000a      translation competence was\u000a      further specified as a combination of knowledge (knowing what), skills\u000a      (knowing how) and ability to\u000a      reflect (knowing why). It also includes interpersonal aspects (awareness\u000a      of the social role of\u000a      translators, knowing the standards applicable to the service provision,\u000a      complying with professional\u000a      ethics), as well as entrepreneurial aspects (the organization of client\u000a      relationships, work and\u000a      budget planning, time management).\u000a    In view of this complexity, translation competence cannot be developed\u000a      through standard language\u000a      programmes. Translator training is not merely a skill-producing activity:\u000a      it requires customized\u000a      translator training programmes which cater for the complexity of\u000a      translation competence,\u000a      coherently linking programme content, learning and teaching methods, and\u000a      assessment to the\u000a      development of each sub-competence. Given this context, Professor\u000a      Sch&#228;ffner's research at Aston\u000a      University evaluated which learning, teaching, and assessment methods are\u000a      most effective in the\u000a      development of translation competence. Her focus was on the links between\u000a      teaching methods\u000a      and the development of the specific sub-competences, such as textual\u000a      competence (S3.2),\u000a      thematic competence (S3.3), service provision competence (S3.6). This\u000a      research was informed by\u000a      engaging with existing literature and based on empirical studies,\u000a      especially observation of\u000a      classroom activities and analysis of student performance as a result of\u000a      changes in teaching and\u000a      assessment methods. The results of these empirical studies served as basis\u000a      for the design and\u000a      modification of translator training programmes (S3.4, S3.5).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36981","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    CFL impact claimed here falls into two main areas &#8212; forensic casework and\u000a      improvement in police policy, training and practice in their investigative\u000a      interviews.\u000a    1. Forensic casework:\u000a      Impact through casework: Reports for forensic investigations, and\u000a      provision of opinion and evidence for police investigations, criminal\u000a      trials and civil proceedings, have all contributed to verdicts of guilt or\u000a      innocence and to judgements in civil and appeal Courts.\u000a    MC, TG and NM are on the UK Serious and Organised Crime Agency Expert\u000a      Advisors' database and are regularly involved in casework on stalking,\u000a      sexual assault, murder and terrorism. This work involves analysis and\u000a      expert report writing, sometimes followed by appearances in Court [Section\u000a      5: 1, 2, 3, 8]. In addition CFL has provided evidence in civil cases\u000a      involving copyright infringement and unfair dismissal. We regularly\u000a      communicate to police and wider user groups through training events and\u000a      the media [Section 5: 8].\u000a    Our casework clearly has considerable significance for the victims of\u000a      crime, for the accused, and for those engaged in civil battles. Evidence\u000a      of impact can be found not only in guilty and innocent verdicts but also\u000a      in summings-up and judgements. In one case involving fraud and extortion\u000a      [R v Alder 2008 Peterborough Crown Court] the judge commented that \"Dr\u000a      Grant, the linguist for the prosecution, provided convincing and measured\u000a      evidence [...] This evidence contributes considerably to the case against\u000a      Mr Alder\" [Section 5: 2]. Further, in a murder case where an appeal\u000a      against conviction was lodged against the linguistic evidence provided by\u000a      Prof. Coulthard, the Court of Appeal upheld the evidence [Hodgson, D. v\u000a      [2009] EWCA Crim (31 March 2009)] indicating that Prof Coulthard's\u000a      evidence was suitably cautious and, as appropriate, did not extend beyond\u000a      the research base [Section 5:3]. This judgement provides a significant\u000a      precedent for the continued acceptance of linguistic evidence in the\u000a      Courts.\u000a    2. Policy development and training.\u000a      Impact through policy development and training: Research findings have\u000a      changed police practice in interviewing witnesses and suspects, and\u000a      specifically in cases where there is an interpreted interview. Changes to\u000a      Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) taking of non-native English speaker\u000a      witness statements represents a significant, concrete example.\u000a    Interpreter-mediated interviews are of specific interest to the UK police\u000a      [Section 3: 6] and, although interviewers report difficulty with these\u000a      interviews, national training structures do not address this problem. We\u000a      have delivered courses in Greater Manchester Police, Gwent Police, and\u000a      South Yorkshire Police (amongst other forces) to sensitise police officers\u000a      to the complex issues involved and offer advice to interviewers on how to\u000a      manage interpreter-mediated interaction [Section 5: 4, 8]. A good example\u000a      of policy development has been with Greater Manchester Police who changed\u000a      their processes and documentation for dealing with non-English speaking\u000a      witnesses when signing their English language witness statements [Section\u000a      5: 5].\u000a    Directly as a result of CFL research in police interviewing [Section 3:\u000a      4,5,6], CFL became a founding partner of the International\u000a        Investigative Interviewing Research Group (iIIRG) dedicated to\u000a      promoting interaction between police interviewers and researchers. Nearly\u000a      half of the 400 members of iIIRG are drawn from police forces from within\u000a      the UK and 23 other countries, creating a forum for reaching police\u000a      interviewers with the most relevant recent academic findings in the area.\u000a      TG gave the plenary address at the inaugural meeting of iIIRG in 2008, and\u000a      in 2009 CFL delivered the first iIIRG MasterClass for an international\u000a      group of police officers. This MasterClass fed back to police interviewers\u000a      our research findings on linguistic insights into investigative\u000a      interviewing such as those described above. Feedback from this\u000a      MasterClass, received from an FBI agent nearly two years after the event,\u000a      included the comment that \"[the MasterClass] literally changed my life! Or\u000a      at least how I do my job! [...] I use what I gleaned from the MasterClass\u000a      all the time\" [Section 5: 6].\u000a    CFL also draws on its research base to deliver bespoke courses with\u000a      either a general or specific purpose. General courses include the annual International\u000a        Summer School in Forensic Linguistic Analysis (ISSFLA) attended by\u000a      police and other practitioners and academics. The ISSFLA has led directly\u000a      to the propagation of forensic linguistic modules and programmes in\u000a      universities internationally, and has built links with professional units\u000a      in the German Federal Police, the FBI and UK police forces. One example of\u000a      more specific training is that provided on the West Midlands Police\u000a      On-line Undercover Policing Operations programme (run for groups of\u000a      experienced undercover officers three times a year since 2010). This\u000a      programme has changed the practice of officers engaged in undercover\u000a      online work [Section 5: 7, 8].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out at the Centre for Forensic Linguistics (CFL)\u000a      at Aston has achieved the following significant impacts:\u000a    \u000a      Casework: Reports for forensic investigations, and provision of\u000a        opinion and evidence for police investigations, criminal trials and\u000a        civil proceedings, have all contributed to verdicts of guilt or\u000a        innocence and to judgements in civil and appeal Courts.\u000a      Policy development and training: Research findings have changed police\u000a        practice in interviewing witnesses and suspects, and specifically in\u000a        cases where there is an interpreted interview.

Development of theory and methods in forensic text analysis [Section\u000a      3: 1, 2, 4]. To meet criteria for the admissibility of evidence, forensic\u000a      methods must be shown to be reliable and well-founded in theory.\u000a    a) In addressing the theoretical requirement &#8212; MC [Section 3: 1] provides\u000a      an understanding of idiolect and linguistic uniqueness and argues that\u000a      this provides an essential underpinning to forensic authorship\u000a      identification work. TG [Section 3: 2] addresses Coulthard and\u000a      problematises the idea of a theory of idiolect in the context of\u000a      linguistic evidence for a murder case, arguing here and elsewhere that\u000a      authorship analysis rests on the lighter observation of individual\u000a      consistency and distinctiveness of style.\u000a    b) Forensic casework requires valid, reliable and rigorous methods.

Investigative interviews and the use of interpreters in legal\u000a      settings.\u000a    a) Primary research on manipulation by interviewers of rape-victim\u000a      witness-talk [NM, Section 3: 4], and on the interview as a speech event\u000a      and the evidential function of the interview [KH, Section 3: 5],\u000a      complements and extends understandings derived from psychological research\u000a      into the investigative interview, which tend to miss linguistic insights.\u000a      For example, we track the transformations and reformulation of interview\u000a      data as it passes from interview room to courtroom with conversions from\u000a      spoken to written modes and back to spoken. Discursive analysis of\u000a      interviews additionally reveals differences between interviewer and\u000a      interviewee in their orientation to the future evidential uses of the\u000a      data. Analysis of both the format and function of police-suspect\u000a      interviews exposes potential flaws in their use and interpretation as\u000a      evidence, especially given s.34 CJPOA 1994. Such research demonstrates how\u000a      distortions can be largely overcome through increased awareness of the\u000a      linguistic factors involved and this forms the basis of our police\u000a      training;\u000a    b) Research shows the role of the interpreter in legal settings is rarely\u000a      acknowledged and poorly understood by interviewing officers [KK, Section3:\u000a      6]. As detailed in section 4, these insights have produced training for\u000a      interviewers and policy changes leading to improved practice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37244","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Whilst there is no doubt that GPC is the single most valuable\u000d\u000a      resource available to scholars of the Welsh language and its literature\u000d\u000a      (its primary purpose) and the most frequently cited work in that field,\u000d\u000a      its impact reaches many other disciplines within HE in the Arts, Sciences\u000d\u000a      and Social Sciences, other areas of the education system generally, and\u000d\u000a      many spheres of public and commercial life.

Part-of-speech information\u000d\u000a      is given, including gender and plural form(s), singulative or diminutive\u000d\u000a      forms, transitivity of verbs, etc. Major senses are subdivided into sense\u000d\u000a      paragraphs, together with a Welsh definition and English synonyms, and a\u000d\u000a      number of carefully selected quotations arranged in chronological order to\u000d\u000a      illustrate the use of the word, its various forms, figurative use, and\u000d\u000a      colloquial forms and meanings. Variant forms of the headword are treated\u000d\u000a      separately and illustrated with quotations, as are significant\u000d\u000a      collocations, proverbs, etc. Cross-references are given to related\u000d\u000a      entries.\u000d\u000a    GPC benefits from a number of contributors who read texts\u000d\u000a      voluntarily to add to the collection, and the staff can call on the advice\u000d\u000a      of specialist consultants in various fields, including three\u000d\u000a      internationally renowned Celtic etymologists, who volunteer their\u000d\u000a      services. Volunteer proof-readers, including senior academics and former GPC\u000d\u000a      staff, provide invaluable feedback on the proofs.\u000d\u000a    The essential foundation of the work is the citation collection (now\u000d\u000a      numbering about 2.5 million paper slips), which has been augmented by an\u000d\u000a      extensive corpus of electronic texts of all periods, by a 120-million word\u000d\u000a      Web corpus, and by advanced on-line searching techniques. A website has\u000d\u000a      been used to promote the project and its publications since 1997. A\u000d\u000a      concise version of 6,000 pages was published online as a free resource in\u000d\u000a      2003, which has been downloaded thousands of times by scholars and other\u000d\u000a      users for local searching. A &#163;100,000 investment by the University of\u000d\u000a      Wales has recently enabled the conversion of the data to XML and the\u000d\u000a      installation of a modern editing system. An online version of the full\u000d\u000a      dictionary will soon be freely available, and future revision will be\u000d\u000a      online only, allowing for the addition of new vocabulary anywhere in the\u000d\u000a      alphabet.\u000d\u000a    The first edition was published in 61 parts from 1950 to 2002 and\u000d\u000a      contains a total of 7.3 million words of running text in 3,949 pages,\u000d\u000a      forming four substantial volumes arranged under more than 84,000 headwords\u000d\u000a      with almost 350,000 dated citations exemplifying the use of the words from\u000d\u000a      the year 631 to 2002, and over 320,000 Welsh definitions and 290,000\u000d\u000a      English synonyms. The parts of the dictionary published since 1 January\u000d\u000a      1993 are those from the word pallter (part XLIII) onwards, and the\u000d\u000a      second edition of A-B (31 parts in all).\u000d\u000a    The importance of the Dictionary was acknowledged by its inclusion in Eureka\u000a        UK!, a volume published by Universities UK in 2006 listing `100\u000d\u000a      discoveries and developments in UK universities that have changed the\u000d\u000a      world over the last fifty years', such as the momentous discovery of the\u000d\u000a      double-helix structure of DNA.

The project of\u000d\u000a      Hurried Steps is also the subject of a TED talk in December 2013\u000d\u000a      and is currently being published\u000d\u000a      as a performance text by Oberon Books. Options for linking the play and\u000d\u000a      performance with Routes\u000d\u000a      into Language initiatives are currently being explored. Each performance\u000d\u000a      has been followed by a\u000d\u000a      one-hour extensive discussion between the general public and a panel of\u000d\u000a      local stakeholders,\u000d\u000a      service providers and policy makers in order to bring into a local context\u000d\u000a      a phenomenon of global\u000d\u000a      importance that transcends social and cultural boundaries. The production\u000d\u000a      is still on tour across\u000d\u000a      the UK and has now (to July 2013) been seen by over 4,000 people in 12\u000d\u000a      different venues.\u000d\u000a    The performance plus discussion format of the staging aims both to raise\u000d\u000a      awareness of this\u000d\u000a      significantly under-reported situation which transcends national, ethnic,\u000d\u000a      class and religious\u000d\u000a      boundaries, and to address issues such as funding, prioritisation and\u000d\u000a      service provision at a local\u000d\u000a      level. The British Crime Survey, for example, reports that two women a\u000d\u000a      week are murdered by their\u000d\u000a      partner or ex-partner, while `femminicidio', the murder of women, has been\u000d\u000a      a topic of intense\u000d\u000a      debate in Italy over the past few months See The Guardian\u000d\u000a      12\/2\/2013 article by Jessica Abrams\u000d\u000a      with contribution from Wood's PhD student M.

The information, experience and contacts gained are\u000d\u000a      coalescing into a\u000d\u000a      broader partnership between the academy and service providers. National\u000d\u000a      and local government\u000d\u000a      personnel are invited to performances, and in the context of widespread\u000d\u000a      cuts to services around\u000d\u000a      domestic violence, the play has acted as a conduit for discussion while\u000d\u000a      the theatre company's\u000d\u000a      website hosts links to key service providers, ensuring continuity of\u000d\u000a      access to information and\u000d\u000a      assistance.\u000d\u000a    Audience response is monitored through individual evaluation forms to\u000d\u000a      raise the awareness both of\u000d\u000a      practitioners and participants (5b). The impact of Hurried\u000d\u000a        Steps, a dyptich of performance and\u000d\u000a      discussion, has been considerable. Performances have been acclaimed in the\u000d\u000a      national press and\u000d\u000a      elsewhere (5a) `Nicolette Kay directs the often exhilarating\u000d\u000a      proceedings...a production of real and\u000d\u000a      moving character' The Guardian; `There are fine performances in\u000d\u000a      this gripping but measured\u000d\u000a      production' Evening Standard; `It's beautiful work from the\u000d\u000a      Finborough, the actors, director and\u000d\u000a      designers ...'

Extra!\u000d\u000a    Audience feedback is overwhelmingly positive: 97% would recommend others\u000d\u000a      to see the show;\u000d\u000a      over 90% felt their understanding of the issues was deepened. Respondents\u000d\u000a      also appreciated the\u000d\u000a      work as a piece of art, not merely agit-prop. Average rating was 4.4 out\u000d\u000a      of 5. Comments suggested\u000d\u000a      that audience members also re-evaluated their attitude towards live arts,\u000d\u000a      and this was particularly\u000d\u000a      significant among potentially excluded\/ self-excluded audiences (5g). `It\u000d\u000a      is very intense so makes\u000d\u000a      you think about women's rights in different cultures'; `I would like my\u000d\u000a      friends to see it so they can\u000d\u000a      be aware of the extent of violence against women'; `eye-opening'; `the\u000d\u000a      play gives you an\u000d\u000a      international insight into the whole issue'. After seeing the play in\u000d\u000a      Brighton, a group of young\u000d\u000a      women from local housing estates worked with New Shoes to produce\u000d\u000a      a work of theatre which\u000d\u000a      would tell their own stories, staged in May 2012.\u000d\u000a    Fayard makes a significant contribution at an institutional level\u000d\u000a      to the way rape is understood and\u000d\u000a      dealt with, and highlights the significant and transformative political\u000d\u000a      power of support organisations.\u000d\u000a      Her article on the Jimmy Savile case, `Apr&#232;s le cas Savile', aimed at the\u000d\u000a      European lay audience,\u000d\u000a      has appeared on French NGO websites and been widely disseminated within\u000d\u000a      NGOs membership\u000d\u000a      infrastructure (5c). Her identification of new areas of consensus\u000d\u000a      and contention around sexual\u000d\u000a      violence has led to plans for a pan-European network of organisations\u000d\u000a      concerned with the\u000d\u000a      prevention of violence against women and the provision of victim support.\u000d\u000a      This collaboration is\u000d\u000a      working towards the production of a dataset which will enable objective\u000d\u000a      transnational comparisons\u000d\u000a      interpretations of rape and its consequences, which will inform and\u000d\u000a      potentially influence EU\u000d\u000a      legislation. International campaigns against rape will be initiated\u000d\u000a      through the sharing of good\u000d\u000a      practice, with Fayard, as bilingual researcher, strategically placed to\u000d\u000a      coordinate. The network (Co-ordinated\u000d\u000a      Action on Rape in Europe &#8212; CARE) will enable groups to share knowledge and\u000d\u000a      expertise, enhancing understanding and improved policies and practices in\u000d\u000a      this field. Practitioners\u000d\u000a      and support agencies working in this area have spoken of the benefits of\u000d\u000a      taking part in the\u000d\u000a      research and of joining the network, testifying to its value in terms of\u000d\u000a      shaping policy and legislative\u000d\u000a      debate, learning from international practices and experiences, and\u000d\u000a      challenging perceptions and\u000d\u000a      orthodox analyses of the issues underlying rape.\u000d\u000a    The work has already raised the awareness of the groups and key\u000d\u000a      individuals in this field, through\u000d\u000a      its identification of factors contributing to the continuing failure of\u000d\u000a      the socio-political processing of\u000d\u000a      rape including the justice system. A representative of the French gender\u000d\u000a      equality pressure group\u000d\u000a      Mix-Cit&#233;s stated: \"As a result of [our exchange] I feel I have come a\u000d\u000a        long way, I have asked myself\u000d\u000a        questions on things to which I did not use to give much thought before,\u000d\u000a        well, I would say as far as\u000d\u000a        the aggressors are concerned\" (5e).

Each of these events\u000d\u000a      included a visit to a site in the care of Cadw, Valle Crucis Abbey, Raglan\u000d\u000a      Castle and Strata Florida Abbey, supporting Cadw's mission to promote\u000d\u000a      appreciation of such monuments. The programmes brought architectural\u000d\u000a      historians into dialogue with literary scholars in order to contextualise\u000d\u000a      the poetry associated with the site. Cadw's Lifelong Learning Manager has\u000d\u000a      testified that our forum at Raglan in 2011, and specifically Edwards's\u000d\u000a      paper on feasting in Guto's poetry, inspired her to put on a medieval\u000d\u000a      wine-tasting at the castle, and to propose joint organisation of the open\u000d\u000a      day at Strata Florida in May 2012 (an event repeated in September 2013).\u000d\u000a      Edwards subsequently provided information on wines mentioned in the poetry\u000d\u000a      to the wine merchant responsible for the wine-tasting event at Raglan\u000d\u000a      Castle in 2012.\u000d\u000a    The final project conference in September 2012 included an evening of\u000d\u000a      performances of some of the new texts of Guto's poems by Datgeiniaeth, a\u000d\u000a      group specialising in recitals of medieval Welsh strict-metre poetry to\u000d\u000a      accompaniment based on the music of the Robert ap Huw manuscript. This\u000d\u000a      event built on a workshop on performance of poetry held at Bangor\u000d\u000a      University in May 2009 which was co-organised by Dafydd Johnston under the\u000d\u000a      AHRC `Beyond Text' scheme (see articles by Johnston and Peter Greenhill in\u000d\u000a      Studia Celtica 45, 2011). The project has thus helped performers to\u000d\u000a      develop and promote their work.\u000d\u000a    The conference in September 2012 was also the occasion for the launch of\u000d\u000a      the electronic edition, Guto'r Glyn.net. Although this website has only\u000d\u000a      been available for less than a year of the impact period, statistics from\u000d\u000a      Google Analytics indicate that usage has been increasing gradually, with\u000d\u000a      1,750 unique users from 38 different countries around the world. Students\u000d\u000a      of Celtic Studies from outside Wales particularly appreciate the bilingual\u000d\u000a      site, the option to view text and translation in parallel, and to listen\u000d\u000a      to a reading showing how the poem would have sounded (testimony from\u000d\u000a      Professor of Celtic Studies at University of California Los Angeles).\u000d\u000a    The edition is also being used in HE teaching in Wales (Cardiff,\u000d\u000a      Aberystwyth, Swansea), increasing the resources available for the study of\u000d\u000a      medieval Welsh poetry and providing students with the material for\u000d\u000a      independent in-depth study of various aspects such as manuscripts,\u000d\u000a      language and historical background. A module on 15th-century\u000d\u000a      Wales based on Guto'r Glyn.net and Guto's Wales has been introduced by Dr\u000d\u000a      Rhun Emlyn of the School of History and Welsh History at Aberystwyth\u000d\u000a      University, 'Dweud y Gwir? Ceisio Lleisiau'r Oesoedd Canol' (code\u000d\u000a      HA32120).\u000d\u000a    The value of Guto'r Glyn's poetry for understanding of attitudes towards\u000d\u000a      rivers and flooding in medieval Wales and potential lessons about human\u000d\u000a      responses to natural disaster has been demonstrated by the collaboration\u000d\u000a      between Eurig Salesbury and Dr Hywel Griffiths of the School of Geography\u000d\u000a      at Aberystwyth which resulted in a joint article in the Journal of\u000d\u000a        Historical Geography (available online from 6.12.12, see references\u000d\u000a      above), and presentations by Salisbury at the Climate Change Consortium of\u000d\u000a      Wales workshop at Gregynog in April 2013 and at the Future Climate\u000d\u000a      Dialogues symposium in Aberystwyth in June 2013.\u000d\u000a    The Guto'r Glyn website was on a short-list of three online resources in\u000d\u000a      the 16-19 age-group category of the Welsh Government's National Digital\u000d\u000a      Learning Awards in June 2013.\u000d\u000a    Non-academic user responses to the website include enquiries from family\u000d\u000a      historians, and we have established a partnership to exchange information\u000d\u000a      with the `Dating Old Welsh Houses Group', a volunteer organisation\u000d\u000a      recording historic houses in Gwynedd (www.datingoldwelshhouses.co.uk).\u000d\u000a    The discovery of King Richard III's skeleton in 2012\/13 led to increased\u000d\u000a      interest in our work on Guto'r Glyn, since Guto's poem in praise of Sir\u000d\u000a      Rhys ap Thomas (Guto'r Glyn.net, poem 14) contains contemporary evidence\u000d\u000a      relating to Richard's death. When the wounds on the skull were revealed in\u000d\u000a      February 2013 Johnston realized that Guto's account of `shaving the boar's\u000d\u000a      head' could be understood literally as a reference to a ritual cutting of\u000d\u000a      the hair of a man whose emblem was the white boar. This information was\u000d\u000a      passed on to the team working on the skeleton at Leicester University, was\u000d\u000a      reported on the BBC Wales news, and was published by Johnston in the Welsh\u000d\u000a      Poetry Society journal Barddas (April 2013).\u000d\u000a    Barry Lewis is quoted in an article in The Observer (10.2.13) on\u000d\u000a      the threat posed by the HS2 line to the site of the battle of Edgecote\u000d\u000a      (Banbury), citing the poetry of Guto'r Glyn and others as evidence of the\u000d\u000a      historic significance of the site for the Welsh.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This project has contributed to Welsh culture by increasing appreciation\u000d\u000a      of the poetry of one of the finest exponents of the bardic tradition, by\u000d\u000a      using that poetry to promote understanding of the literature and history\u000d\u000a      of medieval Wales, and by collaborating with other organisations to\u000d\u000a      further their promotion of Wales's cultural heritage.

It was then recommended by Alexander McCall\u000a      Smith in the Christmas\u000a      Scotsman. The book and CD were re-launched with a performance\u000a      `event' in the Edinburgh Book\u000a      Festival 2008. Approximately 200 attended. The book has sold out twice and\u000a      is being reprinted,\u000a      and together with the CD with data files, editorial information, sound\u000a      files and graphics is being\u000a      widely used by scholars, specialists and performers. The further\u000a      development of discrete topics\u000a      within the thesis and book since 2008 has led to invitations to address\u000a      particular constituencies.\u000a      For impact, these demonstrate reach in terms of diversity of audiences and\u000a      outreach in terms of\u000a      effective dissemination to local communities; for example, Hugh Cheape was\u000a      asked to address the\u000a      Conference of the P&#236;obaireachd Society in 2010, a specialist group of\u000a      about 200, on the music of\u000a      the Mackays of Raasay, and the same topic was then used for a\u000a      performance-lecture in the\u000a      National Piping Centre `Piping Live' Festivals in 2010 and 2011 and in the\u000a      Island of Raasay on\u000a      29.06.13 This has led to a two-way process of knowledge exchange whereby\u000a      specialist research is\u000a      fed into communities in Skye and Raasay (as cradles of traditional\u000a      Highland piping) and the\u000a      knowledge base is strengthened in turn by contextual and collateral\u000a      information assimilated from\u000a      language and primary sources within the region.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This work, summarised in published form, has reshaped the history,\u000a      musicology and sociology of\u000a      the bagpipe as a high profile, popular and international musical\u000a      instrument, enlarging\u000a      understanding of a misunderstood and stereotyped phenomenon of the\u000a      nation's culture.

A national collection of a national instrument and CD-ROM\u000a      (National Museums Scotland\u000a      2008). Foundations had been laid in preliminary fieldwork to gauge levels\u000a      of understanding and to\u000a      test research questions in public spheres e.g. Edinburgh Festival\u000a      Exhibition, `Pipes, Harps &amp;\u000a      Fiddles' (1976) and `Check-list' catalogue published by Edinburgh\u000a      University (1983. ISBN 0\u000a      907635 09 1). This field of research was prompted by the need to challenge\u000a      and expand both\u000a      popular and specialist knowledge, and to promote interest, debate and\u000a      further research into a\u000a      musical culture and its sociology that had remained outside significant\u000a      intellectual and\u000a      musicological scrutiny. Data collection and analysis were the drivers for\u000a      research which was based\u000a      on the preliminary need to supply a musicology of the bagpipe as an\u000a      international phenomenon in\u000a      order to overturn prejudice and preconception. The primary source of a\u000a      substantial collection of\u000a      instruments and associated material &#8212; an `organology' &#8212; has never existed\u000a      in the UK and had\u000a      never been scrutinised because it was dispersed and `invisible' or ignored\u000a      because it did not fit a\u000a      stereotype. The early stages of the research and data collection resulted\u000a      in the `Museum of Piping'\u000a      in the National Piping Centre (1995) and publication of a SCRAN database\u000a      (2003). These outputs\u000a      put an organology for the bagpipe into the public domain and encouraged a\u000a      new critical awareness\u000a      of a multi-facetted instrument. The organology has now been supplemented\u000a      by more data and\u000a      these remain as `clean' data for continuing research and\u000a      re-interpretation.\u000a    Between 1993 and 2008, the research was tested against every major\u000a      European public museum\u000a      and conservatoire collection, including specialist overseas collections\u000a      such as the Crosby Brown\u000a      Collection in the New York Met, the Mus&#233;e des Instruments de Musique in\u000a      Brussels, and\u000a      collections in France and Spain. A sustained stream of outputs included\u000a      lectures, broadcasts,\u000a      exhibitions and demonstrations. Ongoing research was summarised in The\u000a        Book of the Bagpipe\u000a      (Appletree Press 1999, 80-pages, illustrated) written for a general\u000a      readership, and formulated in a\u000a      series of 32 specialist articles (to date, 2013), disseminating the\u000a      research for peer-review in both\u000a      scholarly and performer communities, while also maintaining a flow of 21\u000a      further published items to\u000a      distil information verbally and graphically for the widest possible\u000a      audience.\u000a    The subject itself (i.e. the musicology) advanced into different research\u000a      pathways such as scrutiny\u000a      of a varied and changing status for the instrument in Scotland (as opposed\u000a      to a readily assumed\u000a      autonomous and fixed `traditional' element in Scottish culture) and\u000a      evident links to the bagpipe as\u000a      international phenomenon in Ireland, Britain and `borrowing on' the wider\u000a      Europe. Other research\u000a      insights included the understanding of a more complex and nuanced\u000a      surviving musical culture in\u000a      Scotland and roots in both Gaelic tradition and the European Neo-Baroque.\u000a      Between 2008 and\u000a      2013, the research was actively disseminated (in line with UHI community\u000a      engagement) with Hugh\u000a      Cheape and Decker Forrest giving lectures and performances in Skye and\u000a      Raasay. This\u000a      exemplifies a two-way process of knowledge exchange and community\u000a      engagement.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38046","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Cuairt Mhic'IlleMh&#236;cheil is a BBC radio series of 8x30-minute\u000a      programmes, researched, scripted,\u000a      and presented by Dr Sti&#249;bhart, tracing the life and works of the major\u000a      Gaelic folklore collector\u000a      Alexander Carmichael (1832-1912), broadcast thrice over the past five\u000a      years. As a result:\u000a    \u000a      new insights from academic research were reinterpreted for a popular\u000a        audience;\u000a      significant, hitherto undiscovered cultural capital was returned to\u000a        marginalised minority\u000a        communities in the Scottish G&#224;idhealtachd;\u000a      a foundation was laid for sustained, mutually beneficial collaboration\u000a        with individuals and\u000a        groups within the region.\u000a    \u000a    BBC Radio nan G&#224;idheal does not record exact listening figures. The\u000a      programmes' significance,\u000a      however, for listeners and the broadcasting institution itself, can be\u000a      gauged by the fact that Cuairt\u000a      was repeated twice during the time covered by the REF, given a permanent\u000a      website (G), and\u000a      enthusiastically endorsed by the then head of Radio nan G&#224;idheal (C).\u000a    Throughout his career Dr Sti&#249;bhart has demonstrated a commitment to\u000a      bringing research insights\u000a      to a wider audience, through broadcast media and work with community\u000a      organisations and\u000a      societies, especially in vulnerable marginal communities in the\u000a      G&#224;idhealtachd whose cultural\u000a      confidence is fragile, where academic involvement remains relatively\u000a      uncommon and\u000a      correspondingly meaningful. Previous engagement with diverse `communities\u000a      of interest' in these\u000a      areas &#8212; historians, genealogists, and community animateurs &#8212; had already\u000a      elicited valuable\u000a      feedback and long-term cooperation, enriching a shared understanding of a\u000a      complex cultural\u000a      heritage.\u000a    Cuairt thus represented a continuation of Dr Sti&#249;bhart's\u000a      professional practice. Its subject met BBC\u000a      Radio nan G&#224;idheal's established commitment to educate and empower\u000a      listeners whose formal\u000a      education had rarely taken account of their own Gaelic culture and\u000a      heritage, and to challenge\u000a      prevailing anglocentric cultural values and social assumptions (C).\u000a    The series was recorded on location throughout the G&#224;idhealtachd, in\u000a      districts where Alexander\u000a      Carmichael lived and\/or collected (C). Despite Carmichael's cultural\u000a      significance, little was known\u000a      about the man himself, his controversial achievements, or his involvement\u000a      with the contributors'\u000a      own areas (C, D, F). With this in mind, Dr Sti&#249;bhart supplied contributors\u000a      with contextualised\u000a      transcripts from Carmichael's unpublished manuscripts in Edinburgh\u000a      University Library. This new\u000a      material prompted contributors to make crucial connections between\u000a      Carmichael's informants and\u000a      living Gaelic tradition. This led to further dialogue with Dr Sti&#249;bhart,\u000a      inspired fresh research, and\u000a      elicited novel interpretative frameworks (A&#8212;F, H). Feedback testifies to\u000a      the diverse impacts\u000a      resulting from Cuairt Mhic'IlleMh&#236;cheil and Dr Sti&#249;bhart's ongoing\u000a      engagement with series\u000a      contributors.\u000a    Research to be published next year by John MacFarlane, Taynuilt, on the\u000a      topography, history, and\u000a      cultural heritage of his native Mid-Lorn &#8212; he is the last native Gaelic\u000a      speaker there &#8212; has been\u000a      greatly facilitated by discussion with Dr Sti&#249;bhart. Collaboration with Dr\u000a      Sti&#249;bhart enabled Mr\u000a      MacFarlane to trace the biography of a major local bard, as well as to\u000a      unearth an associated song\u000a      for public performance. Mr MacFarlane is presently using material supplied\u000a      by Dr Sti&#249;bhart\u000a      concerning a currently endangered holy well in Appin to alert interested\u000a      parties throughout the\u000a      world to the threat (E).\u000a    Dr Sti&#249;bhart supplied Calum Laing, Alness, with crucial information\u000a      concerning two great-uncles:\u000a      the Rev. John MacRury, the most prolific Gaelic writer of the nineteenth\u000a      century, and his brother\u000a      Seonaidh. This allowed him to compile his important, recently published\u000a      bio-bibliography of the\u000a      former (H), as well as to identify the latter as a hitherto unknown, and\u000a      still to be fully researched,\u000a      assistant of Carmichael who supplied him with exceptionally significant\u000a      charms reworked and\u000a      showcased in Carmina Gadelica (A).\u000a    Ongoing work with Alasdair MacEachainn, Benbecula, has clarified the\u000a      identity of Carmichael's\u000a      island informants, many of whom have descendants there today. It has also\u000a      revealed the origins of\u000a      an internationally significant archaeological find acquired by the\u000a      folklorist: a Pictish stone from\u000a      Sunamul, an island once inhabited by MacEachainn's family. This\u000a      information has been used by\u000a      the contributor in local lectures and community walks (D).\u000a    Sustained collaboration with the Seallam!

Alexander Carmichael\u000a      (1832-1912), the subject of the\u000a      project, is one of the most significant, and controversial, figures in\u000a      late nineteenth-century\u000a      European folklore and ethnography (4, 5, 6). The research focused upon\u000a      Carmichael's manuscript\u000a      archive, held in Edinburgh University Library, a collection of\u000a      international importance, the product\u000a      of a lifetime's assiduous recording throughout his native Highlands,\u000a      especially in the Outer\u000a      Hebrides where he worked as an exciseman for nearly twenty years.\u000a    The first two volumes of Carmichael's magnum opus, Carmina\u000a        Gadelica [1900], represent a major\u000a      ethnographic and artistic achievement of the turn-of-the-century Celtic\u000a      Revival movement. At a\u000a      popular level, this bilingual compendium of charms, blessings, and prayers\u000a      proved highly influential\u000a      as a representation of so-called `Celtic spirituality', and a principal\u000a      inspiration for the contemporary\u000a      Celtic Christianity movement. In scholarly circles, however, Alexander\u000a      Carmichael's legacy came\u000a      to be regarded as hopelessly compromised, mired in doubts over its\u000a      authenticity; the chaotic state\u000a      of his archive and his near illegible hand discouraged further\u000a      investigation (5).\u000a    Dr Sti&#249;bhart's research, in an ongoing series of papers and articles,\u000a      offers a decisive intervention\u000a      in heated disputes that `provided Scottish Gaelic studies with its\u000a      liveliest debate of the century, a\u000a      debate akin in many ways to the Ossianic controversy 200 years before'\u000a      [Ronald Black (ed.), An\u000a        Tuil (Edinburgh, 1999), 711]. Over several years Dr Sti&#249;bhart was\u000a      able to identify and analyse 23\u000a      original field notebooks; in collaboration with archivists at Edinburgh\u000a      University Library, he\u000a      catalogued nearly 4,000 separate items in the notebooks, and investigated\u000a      the family background\u000a      and biographies of 272 named individual informants (1, 3, 6).

Because of his record of research in the publishing\u000a      industry of the Spanish Enlightenment, S&#225;nchez Espinosa was engaged to\u000a      investigate and elucidate the historical context in which the Ibarra Real\u000a      font was first created and used. The aim of this contextualisation was to\u000a      provide the historical, political and social rationale to support the\u000a      reintroduction of the font as an emblem of Spanish distinctiveness and to\u000a      validate the claim of the typeface to be truly representative of Spanish\u000a      culture. By locating the original font within the political and cultural\u000a      environment of the period, S&#225;nchez Espinosa was able to create a robust\u000a      link between the new typeface and a period of high ambition and cultural\u000a      vision in Spanish history.\u000a    The font's cultural significance was conveyed to its intended users,\u000a      namely, publishers, typographers and the general public, through public\u000a      exhibitions and a companion book describing the history and use of the\u000a      typeface; these two elements also generated considerable publicity for the\u000a      project and attracted press attention, including trade journals, to\u000a      highlight the reintroduction of the font. S&#225;nchez Espinosa played a key\u000a      role in the development and realisation of both the exhibition and the\u000a      book. He was primarily responsible for selection and cataloguing of the\u000a      Imprenta Real items and artefacts that appeared in the exhibition and in\u000a      the book, and he contributed a major chapter to the book on the origins of\u000a      the font.\u000a    The particularity of the font was central to the agendas of the project's\u000a      funders. The project supported Microsoft's ethical agenda which aims to\u000a      sustain linguistic and cultural diversity in national and regional\u000a      languages through localisation of its products. The Marketing and\u000a      Operations director of Microsoft Spain, Enrique Fern&#225;ndez-Laguilhoat,\u000a      remarked at the launch of the project that it underlines Microsoft's\u000a      `strong commitment to the respect of the cultural identities' of the\u000a      countries in which it operates (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/bn2sw9m).\u000a      The Spanish Ministry of Industry and the Spanish International Cooperation\u000a      and Development Agency were also among the funders for the project; they\u000a      were also concerned with supporting and developing a\u000a      distinctive Spanish design industry in which Espinosa's contextualisation\u000a      was central. The success of the cultural identity agenda has been remarked\u000a      upon by several commentators. The prominent designer Enric Satu&#233; describes\u000a      the inclusion of the font in Microsoft's catalogue as 'without a doubt,\u000a      the best indication so far of Spanish participation in the international\u000a      graphic design scene' (Arte en la tipograf&#237;a: 25), and Cocoliso,\u000a      writing on the graphic design blog, Unos tipos duros, remarks on\u000a      the luxury of being able `to use a font which is truly Spanish'\u000a      (17.8.2010). The graphic designer J.-M. Ribagorda observes that the\u000a      project's exhibition `connects design with culture and technology through\u000a      the enhancement of national heritage [and] the pursuit of formal identity\u000a      of the Spanish language' and acknowledges that it is `the Royal Spanish\u000a      Press, its historical contribution in the past, and its future\u000a      contribution' to the world of graphic design that binds the whole\u000a      narrative together (Unos tipos duros, 1 December 2009).\u000a    Ibarra Real has been included in the Microsoft font catalogue since March\u000a      2010, and its software can be downloaded for free for Windows, Apple Mac\u000a      and Linux. Figures for Microsoft downloads are commercially sensitive and\u000a      have not been released, but the fact that some 4000 sites worldwide offer\u000a      it for download provides an indication of its reach.\u000a    In addition to the downloadable version, the font was intended from the\u000a      start to be rolled out as a classic font to print media. Spanish and Latin\u000a      American book and graphic designers are already using the Ibarra Real\u000a      typefaces in a significant variety of genres. For example, it has been\u000a      used in institutional publications such as the book for the Prince Felipe\u000a      of Spain's 2009 Prize for Management Excellence, Premios Principe\u000a        Felipe a la excelencia empresarial (2009), see http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/cta7sct;\u000a      in academic publications such as K.

Las versiones neocl&#225;sicas (Murcia: Murcia University\u000a      Press, 2011); in creative and artistic publications such as the Chilean\u000a      Vicente Reyes's La isla (2011) and the recent bibliophile edition\u000a      of Sor Juana In&#233;s de la Cruz, Primero sue&#241;o (Valladolid: Gato\u000a      Gris, 2012). It has been adopted by the main Spanish\/Hispanic publishing\u000a      house, Editorial Planeta, for some of the annotated Renaissance classics\u000a      belonging to its series Espasa Cl&#225;sicos (for example, the recent\u000a      editions of Amad&#237;s de Gaula and Orlando Furioso), and for\u000a      their special editions, like the 3 volume Cortes y Constituci&#243;n de\u000a        C&#225;diz. 200 a&#241;os (2012), an academic collective work commemorating\u000a      the first Spanish constitution. The Ibarra Real typeface and font have\u000a      also been used in the graphic image and text displays of other recent\u000a      exhibitions of historical artefacts, such as Corona y Arqueolog&#237;a en\u000a        el Siglo de las Luces (Royal Palace, Madrid, 15 April-11 July 2010).\u000a      See http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/ctsja4p.\u000a    The project's exhibition, Imprenta Real, fuentes de la tipograf&#237;a\u000a        espa&#241;ola, was shown at two major venues in Spain and Mexico with a\u000a      total recorded footfall specifically for this exhibition of 45,000,\u000a      namely:\u000a    \u000a      The Royal Academy of Arts, Madrid (December 2009-February 2010): 9266\u000a        visitors.\u000a      Museo Regional de Guadalajara, Mexico (November-December 2010): 35222\u000a        visitors.\u000a    \u000a    The exhibition in Guadalajara attracted large numbers of bibliophiles and\u000a      booksellers as it was timed to coincide with the International Book Fair\u000a      held in the city.\u000a    The Ibarra Real project has inspired similar projects, such as the 2010 Exp&#243;sitos,\u000a        La tipograf&#237;a en Buenos Aires, 1780-1824. This project aimed to\u000a      reconstruct the typeface used in the Real Imprenta de Ni&#241;os Exp&#243;sitos, the\u000a      first printing house in Buenos Aires during the last years of the Spanish\u000a      colony. A free downloadable book has been produced that contextualizes the\u000a      birth of this printing house, its political significance in relation to an\u000a      increasing Argentinean identity, its material production, and the steps\u000a      taken in the reconstruction of the font (see http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/d2fsvkz).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The aim of the Ibarra Real Project was to fashion a distinctive Spanish\u000a      font for use in contemporary print and digital media in order to create a\u000a      twenty-first century typographic identity that was firmly rooted in\u000a      Spanish culture.

S&#225;nchez Espinosa has been a\u000a      member of the project since its inception in 2005. His role in the team\u000a      was to research the historical context in which the Ibarra Real font was\u000a      produced. Based on extensive archival and library research, he explored\u000a      the political and ideological background to the creation of the\u000a      eighteenth-century Royal Publishing House (Imprenta Real), its\u000a      administrative organization, working practices, cultural programme,\u000a      material production, and technological and socio-political significance\u000a      (S&#225;nchez Espinosa 2009, 2011, 2012).\u000a    S&#225;nchez Espinosa's research reveals that the publication programme of the\u000a      Royal Publishing House can be interpreted as a record of the political,\u000a      social and cultural changes that occurred in Spain during the 1760s and\u000a      1770s. The creation of Madrid's Imprenta Real satisfied the Spanish\u000a      Crown's need to control the political information then being disseminated\u000a      by periodical publications while simultaneously providing an outlet for\u000a      the elite's own publications. From the mid-1760s, the Spanish government,\u000a      following the example of other European royal presses, funded Imprenta\u000a      Real's programme of publications of cultural, scientific, and political\u000a      significance. S&#225;nchez Espinosa demonstrates that the work and structure of\u000a      Imprenta Real fell completely under government control after 1780. The\u000a      revamped Imprenta Real showed a significant improvement in the materials,\u000a      production methods, and quality of illustrations, accompanied by a growing\u000a      number of presses. It set the standard for book production in the period\u000a      1780-1808 (the beginning of the Peninsular War), in constant competition\u000a      with and emulation of the best private Spanish presses such as Ibarra and\u000a      Sancha, as well as what was being produced in the rest of Europe. But\u000a      S&#225;nchez Espinosa's study also hints at the negative consequences that the\u000a      privileged and growingly monopolistic position of the publicly funded\u000a      Imprenta Real caused for medium-sized Madrid publishing houses which saw\u000a      their production diminish during the 1790s as they could not compete with\u000a      the prestige and the technical superiority of the state-sponsored\u000a      institution.\u000a    The Project was directed by the font designer Dr J.M. Ribagorda (Madrid's\u000a      Complutense University), who was the curator of the exhibition, Imprenta\u000a        Real. Fuentes de la tipograf&#237;a espa&#241;ola.

Its remit, therefore, was to bring tangible\u000d\u000a      linguistic and cultural\u000d\u000a      benefits to the local community (in particular, the enrichment of cultural\u000d\u000a      life, the enhancement of\u000d\u000a      public understanding, and the promotion of cultural diversity) and to\u000d\u000a      contribute to a sense of\u000d\u000a      connected communities and shared space. Throughout the course of its\u000d\u000a      existence it has provided\u000d\u000a      an extensive outreach programme of lectures and seminars (over 50 in the\u000d\u000a      census period), all of\u000d\u000a      which draws on its underpinning research, and has contributed\u000d\u000a      significantly to cultural enrichment\u000d\u000a      in Northern Ireland (and to the creative industries) through participation\u000d\u000a      in TV and radio\u000d\u000a      documentaries and interviews.

The most significant of these, the\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Land\u000d\u000a        and Property Services, was initiated in 2004. NIPNP's research\u000d\u000a      database of historical evidence\u000d\u000a      and place-name analysis has been enhanced by the provision of detailed and\u000d\u000a      technologically-advanced\u000d\u000a      mapping by LPS in our collaborative online website (www.placenamesni.org).\u000d\u000a      This has\u000d\u000a      also enriched and added a cultural dimension (for the first time) to the\u000d\u000a      work of LPS with the result\u000d\u000a      that the general public can now easily access (on a single site)\u000d\u000a      geographical, historical, linguistic\u000d\u000a      and cultural information on the places where they live or visit. The link\u000d\u000a      between onomastic\u000d\u000a      research and mapping providers is unique, and could be followed as a model\u000d\u000a      elsewhere, in the\u000d\u000a      United Kingdom. The research continues and a new version of the website\u000d\u000a      (including new data)\u000d\u000a      was officially launched by the Minister of Finance and Personnel at the\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland Assembly\u000d\u000a      in January 2013. The event provoked considerable media interest and the\u000d\u000a      website has had a total\u000d\u000a      of 172,696 interactive page views in the six months since the launch (as\u000d\u000a      of the end of July 2013).\u000d\u000a    The second major collaboration is in the realm of street names and this\u000d\u000a      has contributed to\u000d\u000a      the embedding of cultural diversity in civil society (through increased\u000d\u000a      visibility for minority\u000d\u000a      indigenous languages) and the enrichment of cultural life. Our street-names\u000d\u000a        project was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the all-Ireland statutory language body, Foras na Gaeilge,\u000d\u000a      in 2005-06 and the\u000d\u000a      origins of over 6,000 street-names in selected urban districts (in 12\u000d\u000a      local council areas) were\u000d\u000a      published online (www.ulsterplacenames.org)\u000d\u000a      in the course of 2008. As a result of the project's\u000d\u000a      scholarly research, the Irish versions of names which appear on public\u000d\u000a      signage can be accepted\u000d\u000a      as authoritative and definitive. Work on street names is ongoing. NIPNP is\u000d\u000a      consulted on a regular\u000d\u000a      basis by local councils in response to requests from the community for\u000d\u000a      bilingual signage;\u000d\u000a      subsequently, the names provided are included in urban maps. The most\u000d\u000a      recent edition of the\u000d\u000a      Belfast Street Map (2010) includes 82 Irish-language versions of names\u000d\u000a      provided by NIPNP which\u000d\u000a      appear in street signage and a further 30 names have been provided to\u000d\u000a      Belfast City Council over\u000d\u000a      the past year which will appear in future editions of the street map and\u000d\u000a      on signage. Moreover, in\u000d\u000a      2011, a cross-community project (funded by Belfast City Council's Good\u000d\u000a      Relations Unit) on Belfast\u000d\u000a      street and district-names invited members of the community to explore\u000d\u000a      their local place-names and\u000d\u000a      respond with further information gleaned from oral and other sources. The\u000d\u000a      engagement between &#211;\u000d\u000a      Mainn&#237;n and the local community was recorded and broadcast on local radio,\u000d\u000a      Radio F&#225;ilte, and\u000d\u000a      resulted in the production of a CD for dissemination to community groups\u000d\u000a      across the city.\u000d\u000a    The most significant of the many collaborations with community-based\u000d\u000a      groups in the\u000d\u000a      census period is that which involved the Lough Neagh Partnership\u000d\u000a      (www.loughneaghheritage.com) &#8212; comprised of stakeholders with an interest in the largest\u000d\u000a      freshwater lake in Britain and Ireland (and drawing representation from\u000d\u000a      local authorities, and\u000d\u000a      statutory and community organisations). It commissioned NIPNP to research\u000d\u000a      place-names which\u000d\u000a      would be encountered by cyclists on the Sustrans Cycle Trail around the\u000d\u000a      lake in order to develop\u000d\u000a      the site for cultural, educational and tourism purposes. By including\u000d\u000a      names of diverse linguistic\u000d\u000a      origin (Irish, English and Scots), this collaboration created space for\u000d\u000a      the engagement of civil\u000d\u000a      society with cultural diversity in the Lough Neagh region, increased\u000d\u000a      public understanding of local\u000d\u000a      history and heritage, and enriched cultural life. The research, published\u000d\u000a      in Lough Neagh Places\u000d\u000a      (2007), enabled the Partnership to pursue further research within the\u000d\u000a      census period in the form of a\u000d\u000a      local history and archaeology project (of eighteen months duration) in\u000d\u000a      2009-10 and so further\u000d\u000a      develop the amenity (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/owmx6nt).\u000d\u000a      The place-names work also drew public attention\u000d\u000a      to the area. Muhr was interviewed on BBC radio as part of a special\u000d\u000a      programme on Lough Neagh\u000d\u000a      which was broadcast across the UK (23\/01\/09), and staff delivered a\u000d\u000a      programme of lectures at\u000d\u000a      local venues, including Lisburn Historical Society (04\/02\/09), Craigavon\u000d\u000a      Museum (07\/03\/09) and\u000d\u000a      Bangor Family History Society (21\/01\/10), all of which engaged with\u000d\u000a      aspects of the research\u000d\u000a      conducted on the Lough Neagh region. Place-names research also fed into\u000d\u000a      the wider cultural\u000d\u000a      environment through participation in BBCNI's acclaimed six-part series Sruthanna\u000d\u000a      (2012), to which\u000d\u000a      both Toner and &#211; Mainn&#237;n contributed.\u000d\u000a    Other forms of engagement which have increased public understanding and\u000d\u000a      enriched\u000d\u000a      cultural life have continued during this period. The Regeneration of South\u000d\u000a      Armagh community\u000d\u000a      group used NIPNP's research in the booklet on local townland names (2008)\u000d\u000a      with funding from the\u000d\u000a      Heritage Lottery Fund.

In\u000d\u000a      order to establish the original form and meaning of each name, over\u000d\u000a      130,000 historical citations\u000d\u000a      (with accompanying source references and other contextual information)\u000d\u000a      were gathered\u000d\u000a      from sources ranging from the 6th century down to the Ordnance Survey\u000d\u000a      records of the 19th\u000d\u000a      century. The resulting historical profile of each name was analysed in the\u000d\u000a      light of the local\u000d\u000a      pronunciation which was transcribed phonetically from recordings in the\u000d\u000a      field. The pronunciations\u000d\u000a      form a unique component of the Project's archive and are crucial in the\u000d\u000a      process of elucidation of\u000d\u000a      names coined in Irish as they preserve the original stress pattern. The\u000d\u000a      analysis was further\u000d\u000a      informed by evidence drawn from archaeology, history, topography and folk\u000d\u000a      tradition.\u000d\u000a    In its ten published volumes (eight during the census period), NIPNP has\u000d\u000a      produced detailed\u000d\u000a      original analyses of approximately 4,000 place-names.

It is primarily through this mechanism that he has achieved\u000d\u000a      impact beyond academia. His translation work led him to become engaged\u000d\u000a      with theatre publishers and with professional theatre practitioners,\u000d\u000a      including actors, directors and theatre companies, with whom he has\u000d\u000a      developed collaborative workshops, readings etc. His translation\u000d\u000a      strategies have brought invigorating new performance pieces to the\u000d\u000a      English-speaking world through which he has challenged the cultural values\u000d\u000a      and assumptions of his audiences. The translations and performances have\u000d\u000a      produced revenue streams for publishers, Hispanic playwrights, theatres,\u000d\u000a      theatre companies, and theatre practitioners\u000d\u000a    Cultural Life and Civil Society: Johnston's work has made a\u000d\u000a      major contribution to the diversification of the repertoire of\u000d\u000a      English-language theatre, thereby increasing opportunities for\u000d\u000a      theatre-goers to experience different cultures and alternative lived\u000d\u000a      experiences that may challenge their own cultural prejudices and\u000d\u000a      assumptions. This impact has been achieved in the first instance through\u000d\u000a      his work as a practising translator (for example, through his translations\u000d\u000a      of Lope de Vega and Lorca), in which his understanding of ethical\u000d\u000a      performability informs and invigorates the translation process. The reach\u000d\u000a      and extent of his impact is considerable. Since 2008, eight of Johnston's\u000d\u000a      translations from Spanish (and one from French) have received thirty-three\u000d\u000a      professional, twelve amateur and eight educational productions, 55% of\u000d\u000a      them in the UK and Ireland; 29% in the US; 10% in Australia and New\u000d\u000a      Zealand, and 6% in Canada. He has established a performance tradition in\u000d\u000a      English for Lope's theatre in particular: between 1900 and 2006 Thacker\u000d\u000a      counts only 22 Lope productions in the UK but Johnston's translations have\u000d\u000a      received 6 professional and three amateur\/semi-professional productions in\u000d\u000a      the last five years alone. He brought Lope's Dog in the Manger to\u000d\u000a      the Washington Shakespeare Company in 2008 where it won five Helen Hayes\u000d\u000a      Awards nominations, including Best Play (1). The Washington\u000d\u000a        Post, acknowledging Johnston's strategy of engineering cultural\u000d\u000a      encounter, observed that `the comedy and characters manage to seem of\u000d\u000a      their own time and ours' (2). Since the RSC season, Dog in the\u000d\u000a        Manger has become the first Spanish Golden Age play to enter the\u000d\u000a      amateur repertoire, receiving ten amateur productions since 2008. His Madness\u000d\u000a        in Valencia (Lope) was re-staged in London in 2009 by a new company\u000d\u000a      &#8212; Black and White Rainbow. It was nominated Time Out's Critic's\u000d\u000a      Choice and Show of the Week and transferred to the West End (3).\u000d\u000a    Johnston's research-led practice has increased the diversity of the\u000d\u000a      repertoire through the introduction of previously unknown plays to the\u000d\u000a      market. Since 2008 Johnston has been commissioned by theatres such as\u000d\u000a      London's Gate and the Royal Court to write translations of plays by\u000d\u000a      writers such as Edgar Ch&#237;as and Juan Mayorga. Since bringing Mayorga, for\u000d\u000a      example, to the attention of the English-speaking spectator, Johnston has\u000d\u000a      brought four more of his plays to production (Nocturnal, Gate\u000d\u000a      Theatre, Hamelin in Toronto, Melbourne and Belfast, The Boy at\u000d\u000a        the Back, in London, and The Le Brun Method of Happiness in\u000d\u000a      a special edition on National Spanish Radio). Johnston's translation of\u000d\u000a      Mayorga's Way to Heaven, for example, has been performed\u000d\u000a      professionally eleven times since 2008, including a nine-month run in New\u000d\u000a      York (4). Its run in the Odyssey Theatre, Los Angeles, received\u000d\u000a      five LA Weekly nominations and won two awards. Translations of\u000d\u000a      modern classics, such as Lorca's Blood Wedding and The House\u000d\u000a        of Bernarda Alba, have received a range of productions (four\u000d\u000a      educational, two professional). Johnston's translations of Lorca have been\u000d\u000a      profiled in the New Statesman, where the writer recognizes\u000d\u000a      Johnston's approach to translation, noting that Bernarda Alba\u000d\u000a      `works well because it avoids falling into the trap of trying to localise\u000d\u000a      or foreignise the performance' (5).\u000d\u000a    An important strand in his impact strategy is direct engagement with\u000d\u000a      theatre companies, directors, actors, and students. He has collaborated\u000d\u000a      closely in the development and production of his translations with major\u000d\u000a      theatres and institutions in the UK and Ireland, including the Royal\u000d\u000a      Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre, Gate Notting Hill, Lyric\u000d\u000a      Theatre Belfast, Rough Magic and Galloglass of Dublin, the Royal Court\u000d\u000a      London, and RADA, e.g. through involvement in workshops and rehearsals. As\u000d\u000a      well as numerous educational productions of his translations (see above),\u000d\u000a      he works directly with future and emerging artists to explore the\u000d\u000a      significance of the shape and tone of his translations. His The Lady\u000d\u000a        Boba (Lope) received a workshop reading at the London Academy of\u000d\u000a      Music and the Dramatic Arts (LAMDA) in January 2013 prior to its\u000d\u000a      professional premiere in the Theatre Royal, Bath, and he delivered\u000d\u000a      training seminars (January 2012 and June 2013) to LAMDA staff and\u000d\u000a      students, as well as a seminar to MRes Creative Writing students at the\u000d\u000a      University of Birmingham (February 2013). He also led post-show\u000d\u000a      discussions after student productions of his translations at the\u000d\u000a      Universities of Warwick (2008) and Birmingham (March 2013), with combined\u000d\u000a      audiences of around 200. His work has increased the accessibility of\u000d\u000a      Spanish theatre for students and has, for example, made possible the\u000d\u000a      introduction of a module in Spanish Golden Age theatre as part of the MA\u000d\u000a      in Classical Theatres in Performance at LAMDA. Johnston also promotes\u000d\u000a      awareness and understanding of Spanish theatre among practitioners through\u000d\u000a      the `Out of the Wings' website which has been live since 2010 (6).\u000d\u000a      This resource, which emerged from a project funded by the AHRC on which\u000d\u000a      Johnston was CI, has become the first point of reference for theatre\u000d\u000a      translation in Spanish and attracted 18,557 unique visitors in the period\u000d\u000a      1 Jan-1 May, 2013.\u000d\u000a    Creative Economy: Johnston has generated wealth in the\u000d\u000a      creative sector through the publication of translations, the staging of\u000d\u000a      plays and increased international exposure and copyright revenue for\u000d\u000a      Hispanic playwrights. The publishing industry has benefited through the\u000d\u000a      publication of new translations (four since 2008) and repeat sales of\u000d\u000a      older translations: five translations published by Oberon have sold over\u000d\u000a      9000 copies in the census period, and his translation of Blood Wedding,\u000d\u000a      published by Hodder, is currently in its thirty-third impression.\u000d\u000a      Productions of Johnston's work have generated substantial audiences for\u000d\u000a      theatre companies and houses and an estimated gross revenue of &#163;1.5\u000d\u000a      million. Dog in the Manger, for example, has played professionally\u000d\u000a      to over 20,000 spectators in the US, Australia and New Zealand, while Madness\u000d\u000a        in Valencia played to over 3000 spectators in London. Returns from\u000d\u000a      theatres for professional productions of Mayorga and Lorca indicate a\u000d\u000a      combined audience for these plays in excess of 30,000 spectators since\u000d\u000a      2008, while his translation of On Insomnia and Midnight, by the\u000d\u000a      previously unknown (in English) Mexican writer Edgar Ch&#237;as, has now played\u000d\u000a      to over 19,000 spectators around the world (including in Mexico), and is\u000d\u000a      published in British and American editions. In the Irish context,\u000d\u000a      Johnston's translation of Moliere's The Miser, that transferred\u000d\u000a      from the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry to the Lyric Theatre in Belfast in\u000d\u000a      2010, gave the Lyric its first ever all-Ireland tour, playing to over 7000\u000d\u000a      spectators (7).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study describes the impact generated by new thinking on the\u000d\u000a      representation of the foreign in translation for the theatre.

The strategies\u000d\u000a      underpinning this are established in Stages of Translation (1).\u000d\u000a      This and subsequent publications analyse how the `performability' of the\u000d\u000a      foreign-language play in English may be secured. The theoretical bases of\u000d\u000a      the performability of translation are set out for the first time in\u000d\u000a      Johnston's work (see 2); previously, the task of rendering a play\u000d\u000a      performable was generally attributed to the director (see the work of\u000d\u000a      Susan Bassnett in this regard). Johnston's research proposes an enriched\u000d\u000a      sense of the term `performability', encompassing strategies of\u000d\u000a      localization (see 3) and concepts of cultural visibility by which\u000d\u000a      the play's principal thematic concerns are modulated to articulate the\u000d\u000a      unfamiliar in terms of the familiar (4). In this way Johnston's\u000d\u000a      research proposes a translation methodology that draws both upon theatre\u000d\u000a      practice and translation theory (5). Theatre pragmatism,\u000d\u000a      accordingly, should be enriched by a commitment to translation as an\u000d\u000a      ethical regime, so that translations should work on stage as fluent and\u000d\u000a      engaging pieces of theatre, as well as inviting mainstream audiences on a\u000d\u000a      journey that will offer a new perspective on their own historically- and\u000d\u000a      culturally-contingent state. In that way this translation practice seeks\u000d\u000a      to resist a notable tendency of the professional English-speaking theatre,\u000d\u000a      which is to erode cultural and linguistic difference (6). In short,\u000d\u000a      the interdisciplinary nature of Johnston's work brings the ethical\u000d\u000a      anxieties of Translation Studies &#8212; revolving around the representation of\u000d\u000a      cultures alien to us &#8212; into creative tension with the pragmatism of\u000d\u000a      commercial stage practice, a theoretical position that has been generally\u000d\u000a      credited for bringing theatre translation (described by Lefevere in 1992\u000d\u000a      as the `cinderella of translation theory') into the theoretical mainstream\u000d\u000a      (7).\u000d\u000a    Johnston's work represents a qualitative shift in stage translation in\u000d\u000a      that it establishes the translated text not as second-order creation, but\u000d\u000a      rather as an opportunity for a different quality of reception, one that is\u000d\u000a      enriched through the heightened impact of cultural encounter (8).\u000d\u000a      By analysing the dramaturgical consciousness (rather than philological\u000d\u000a      training) that underpins a commercially and artistically successful\u000d\u000a      translation practice, Johnston's work provides a detailed response to the\u000d\u000a      first of the research questions articulated above, and in doing so\u000d\u000a      provides the basis for theatre translation as a writing practice. Beyond\u000d\u000a      this, his emphasis on translation ethics &#8212; namely, that plays in\u000d\u000a      translation, appropriately negotiated by the translator, can and should\u000d\u000a      bring the dynamic possibilities of cultural encounter into the auditorium\u000d\u000a      &#8212; prompts translators, including himself, to produce texts that will\u000d\u000a      challenge and enrich the spectator experience. As the section on impact\u000d\u000a      will show, the creative tension between these two aspirations lies at the\u000d\u000a      heart of the multiple and continuing productions that his translations\u000d\u000a      have enjoyed.\u000d\u000a    The body of underpinning research for which impact is claimed was carried\u000d\u000a      out by Johnston since 1996 while employed at Queen's as Professor of\u000d\u000a      Spanish.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38636","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact 1.

She introduced La caza (Saura, 1966)\u000d\u000a      to a public audience of 116 people. Linked to research for his monograph\u000d\u000a      on Kassovitz, which also deals with broader questions of multicultural and\u000d\u000a      immigrant identity in French cinema (3.5), Higbee was\u000d\u000a      invited to participate in a symposium `Cinemas of the Maghreb' as part of\u000d\u000a      the 2010 Carthage Film Festival (JCC).The symposium attracted c.100\u000d\u000a      attendees, a mixture of academics, journalists and industry professionals,\u000d\u000a      and was reported on the Africultures website (5.8). Handyside\u000d\u000a      organised a `Beaches' film season at the Plymouth Arts Centre centre in\u000d\u000a      2012.

Working\u000d\u000a      in collaboration with the Picturehouse's national programmer and the\u000d\u000a      manager of the cinema in Exeter, film specialists from the College of\u000d\u000a      Humanities design a programme of fortnightly screenings, deliver\u000d\u000a      introductions to each film and host a discussion with members of the\u000d\u000a      public after the screenings. Faulkner, Handyside, Higbee and Hipkins\u000d\u000a      have delivered six introductions between September 2012 and June 2013 as\u000d\u000a      part of the `Hidden Classics of European Cinema' strand of the Exeter\u000d\u000a      Screen Talks, attracting a total of 210 spectators. The project also has\u000d\u000a      impact beyond the region, particularly through the use of social media\u000d\u000a      (Facebook and Twitter) as well as the blog entry (written by the academic\u000d\u000a      giving the talk) that is published online at least a fortnight before the\u000d\u000a      screening and remains on the blog as an archive of each talk (5.10).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by film specialists in Modern Languages (ML) at the University\u000d\u000a      of Exeter promotes the artistic value, diversity and continuing social,\u000d\u000a      cultural and political relevance of European cinema to a variety of\u000d\u000a      audiences in the UK and abroad.

In fact, as the popular success in this country in\u000d\u000a      the past 20 years of directors such as Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Alejandro\u000d\u000a      Amen&#225;bar, Agn&#232;s Jaoui, Mathieu Kassovitz and Tom Tykwer, as well as stars\u000d\u000a      such as Javier Bardem, Juliette Binoche and Audrey Tautou shows, European\u000d\u000a      cinema's cultural and economic reach is actually much wider. European\u000d\u000a      cinema has also always been a cultural space in which filmmakers have\u000d\u000a      explored, and in which audiences have engaged with, key contemporary\u000d\u000a      socio-political issues. Reflecting this diversity, the interdisciplinary\u000d\u000a      research outputs and projects by ML film specialists have led to impact\u000d\u000a      beyond academia, covering a wide range of both popular and art cinema in\u000d\u000a      Europe from the 1920s to the present day, and drawing on a range of\u000d\u000a      historical, sociological, industrial, and cultural approaches to these\u000d\u000a      films and filmmakers. This research can broadly be divided into three\u000d\u000a      areas:\u000d\u000a    1) The place of the audience in European cinema\u000d\u000a    This strand of research pays particular attention to how public\u000d\u000a      discourses around films are shaped and consumed by audiences and is\u000d\u000a      directly related to the AHRC collaborative research project `In Search of\u000d\u000a      Italian Cinema Audiences in the 1940s and 1950s: Gender, Genre and\u000d\u000a      National Identity' for which Dr Danielle Hipkins (Senior Lecturer,\u000d\u000a      Italian; appointed 2004) is the CI, working with colleagues from Bristol\u000d\u000a      and Oxford Brookes Universities (&#163;693,950 awarded, 3.7). The\u000d\u000a      research focuses on memories of cinema-going in Italy in the 1940s and\u000d\u000a      1950s, addressing the ways cinema audiences are understood within local\u000d\u000a      and national community frameworks (3.1).\u000d\u000a    2) Studies of popular European cinema (genres and stars)\u000d\u000a    This includes AHRC-funded research (3.8) by Professor Susan\u000d\u000a        Hayward (Professor of French and film studies 1996-2000; currently\u000d\u000a      emeritus Professor) on the popular French star Simone Signoret as cultural\u000d\u000a      sign (3.2), which has fed into her more general work on\u000d\u000a      stardom and genre in film theory (3.3) and her more recent\u000d\u000a      publications and British Academy-funded research on the hitherto ignored\u000d\u000a      political significance of French Costume Dramas of the 1940s and 1950s.\u000d\u000a      Similarly, Dr Will Higbee (Senior Lecturer, French; appointed\u000d\u000a      2002) published an AHRC-funded study (3.9) of the transformation of\u000d\u000a      the popular in contemporary French cinema as symptomatic of wider shifts\u000d\u000a      in French popular culture in the works of director Mathieu Kassovitz (3.4).\u000d\u000a      In addition, Professor Sally Faulkner (Associate Professor,\u000d\u000a      Spanish; appointed 2001) has completed AHRC-funded research into popular\u000d\u000a      Spanish cinema of the 1960s (3.5 and 3.10), as well as\u000d\u000a      further AHRC-funded research into middlebrow cinema in Spain (3.11),\u000d\u000a      which she is currently developing in international contexts. Faulkner's\u000d\u000a      research has been recognised in the award of the 2013 Philip Leverhulme\u000d\u000a      Prize.

As the only editing project on this author\u000a      that is currently available, it has redefined Gutzkow's place in the\u000a      literary canon, transformed public access and raised Gutzkow's public\u000a      profile. The project website was launched 22 Jan 2001. From January 2008\u000a      to June 2011, it is calculated from earlier figures that the site received\u000a      more than 3,000 hits. In July 2011 a new counter was installed, which\u000a      reveals 4,750 hits from that date to 30 July 2013 (5.3), suggesting\u000a      increasing interest as the number of texts and commentaries available has\u000a      expanded. Evidence of this transformed public profile can be found in the\u000a      press. Germany's leading daily broadsheet Frankfurter Allgemeine\u000a        Zeitung, which has a daily circulation of approximately 362,000 and\u000a      the highest distribution abroad of any German broadsheet, highlighted\u000a      Gutzkow's relevance for today's readers on Gutzkow's bicentenary, 17 March\u000a      2011, stressing his `concept for a modern novel'. In addition, the project\u000a      has revolutionised the Gutzkow corpus, placing journalistic texts and\u000a      critical commentaries alongside his more widely-known literary works for\u000a      the first time.\u000a    (a) Media Reports (Press and Radio)\u000a    When the project was first launched, non-academic reviews appeared in the\u000a      international press, which highlighted the innovative nature of its peer\u000a      editing and the re-location of Gutzkow in the public sphere rather than\u000a      specialist literary domains; these aspects continue to attract interest in\u000a      articles of leading papers up to the present day (5.7, 5.8), which\u000a      call the concept behind the edition `ingenious' (5.7).\u000a    In 2008, an article in the leading German weekly newspaper Die Zeit\u000a      (distribution of 500,000), took the publication of Gutzkow's influential\u000a      novel Der Zauberer von Rom as a welcome opportunity to celebrate\u000a      the fact that Gutzkow's `remarkable novels were being made available\u000a      again' and this time for a wider audience and with a commentary (5.8).\u000a    The 2011 Gutzkow bicentenary was a further catalyst for public engagement\u000a      with Gutzkow. Vonhoff and Lauster's 3.5 is the foundation of the\u000a      project. This, together with the 9 volumes published so far (one of which\u000a      is in its 2nd edition), is acknowledged in the leading Swiss\u000a      daily Tages-Anzeiger (distribution of 550,000) (5.7). The\u000a      article refers to the `innovative concept of an \"edition in progress\",\u000a      which uses the internet to produce publications that are financially\u000a      affordable and are at the same time of the highest scholarly standard'.\u000a      The columnist highlights the importance of the commentaries, `as without\u000a      them readers will not be able to understand the works adequately any\u000a      longer'.\u000a    Project member Ute Schneider was also interviewed by a regional German\u000a      radio programme on SWR2, a culture channel produced for Baden-W&#252;rttemberg\u000a      and Rheinland-Pfalz, but broadcast nationwide with an estimated audience\u000a      of 300,000 per day (5.9). She was asked about the conference in\u000a      Mainz that celebrated Gutzkow's bicentenary, and acknowledged the role the\u000a      Gutzkow edition has played for the revival of the author.\u000a    (b) Non-academic Readers\u000a    The project's combination of edited texts available in print and online,\u000a      alongside the documents and commentaries published exclusively online, has\u000a      proved particularly successful in drawing the attention of non-academic\u000a      users. There has been a sea-change in readers' perceptions of Gutzkow.\u000a      Readers' testimonies comment on peer editing; for example, a member of the\u000a      Redaktion SPRACHKUNST made a suggestion for additional material in October\u000a      2009, and praised `the great potential' he saw in `the interactive online\u000a      approach for commentaries' (5.2). A scientist reader from CERN (the\u000a      European Organization for Nuclear Research), Switzerland, contacted the\u000a      project leaders in July 2008 with information about a reading of Gutzkow's\u000a      novel Die Ritter vom Geiste in the \"Klassikerforum\", an online\u000a      reading group (5.2, 5.4). Between 31\/5\/2008 and 24\/9\/2008 these\u000a      forum users produced more than 15 pages of comments on their reading\u000a      experience (5.4). Contributions include a general recognition of\u000a      the importance of the novel as well as the author, the discussion of\u000a      individual characters, and the frustration about not having a reliable\u000a      edition of it easily available. A web counter shows more than 35,000 hits\u000a      in this exchange between non-professional readers over this period, and\u000a      the exchange led to direct approaches to various members of the project\u000a      team. Other users of the edition contributed to the open-question section\u000a      of the edition.\u000a    For the bicentenary, Vonhoff, alongside other leading researchers in the\u000a      field, was invited to contribute two essays to the popular and\u000a      highly-regarded online literary magazine literaturkritik.de (5.5).\u000a      The March 2011 issue was dedicated specifically to Gutzkow. Together the\u000a      two articles have been visited by 4,337 readers between 11 March 2011 and\u000a      30 July 2013.\u000a    The project is also referenced on a literary blog in December 2010 (5.6);\u000a      the popularity of this blog in general is evidenced by its web counter\u000a      which shows more than 900,000 hits since July 2010.\u000a    (c) Arts Organizations \/ Libraries and Archives\u000a    A member of the Landesarchiv Baden-W&#252;rttemberg informed the project of a\u000a      newly discovered letter exchange (May 2009) (5.2).\u000a    From 2008 to 2013, the Universit&#228;tsbibliothek Johann Christian\u000a      Senckenberg (Frankfurt\/Main), which holds the literary estate of Gutzkow,\u000a      spent 19,826 Euros on the conservation and restauration of archived\u000a      letters to and from the author (21,500 pages), a direct consequence &#8212; as\u000a      the Director of the Manuscript Department attested &#8212; of the increased\u000a      interest in and usage of these holdings (5.1).\u000a    Impact 2: Request for full integration into a linguistic database of\u000a        principal German texts from 1600 to 1900\u000a    In October 2012, the Deutsches Textarchiv in Berlin\u000a      (Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften), an\u000a      interdisciplinary linguistic digitization project, requested access to the\u000a      texts of the Gutzkow edition with the aim of fully integrating the results\u000a      of the editorial work on Gutzkow's texts within their linguistically\u000a      annotated public database.

It uniquely combines editorial progressiveness (internet-based work\u000a      in progress) and technological innovation (the Kronos electronic\u000a      publishing platform) with a critical interrogation of a largely neglected\u000a      literary and journalistic corpus. Gutzkow had been the figurehead of the\u000a      Young German movement which introduced European liberalism into German\u000a      cultural life after the death of Goethe and Hegel. His writings\u000a      continually promoted these moderate values when, after the failed\u000a      revolution of 1848\/49, the German intellectual elite broadly split into\u000a      conservatism and socialism and as an effect sidelined his liberal agenda.\u000a      This first modern edition of his complete works aims to re-establish\u000a      Gutzkow as a major contributor to 19th-century German culture.\u000a    In 2001, Lauster and Vonhoff launched the online-edition and edited the\u000a      first volume introducing the Gutzkow project to the public (3.5).\u000a      Since then both have acted as co-directors of the international Gutzkow\u000a      project and secured external funding (3.7, 3.8). Lauster's main\u000a      research interests in comparative literature of the nineteenth century,\u000a      with a particular focus on the 'journalistic revolution' that began to\u000a      affect all forms of writing and publishing from 1830 onwards, supports her\u000a      research into Gutzkow's journalistic enterprises. A 2007 monograph\u000a      reassessed the status of journalistic writing in nineteenth-century Europe\u000a      (3.3) and forms the basis of her editing text and commentary of\u000a      Gutzkow's contemporaneous overview Die Zeitgenossen in 2010. She\u000a      is currently working on the development of intercultural networks of\u000a      knowledge in the nineteenth century, and the place of Gutzkow within those\u000a      networks.\u000a    Vonhoff's long-standing research interests in prose fiction and\u000a      narratology and in scholarly editing have combined to bear fruit in the\u000a      Gutzkow Editionsprojekt. An internationally recognised Gutzkow specialist\u000a      (3.1, 3.6), Vonhoff focussed on setting up the hybrid\u000a      edition in its early years (developing the website; securing a publishing\u000a      contract). Together with Lauster, he now directs the Exeter-based website\u000a      of the edition. In his 2007 monograph (3.4) Vonhoff developed\u000a      categories which help to describe narrative evolution in a social context;\u000a      this research helps specify Gutzkow's standing within narrative fiction.\u000a      The efforts to raise the author's profile were rewarded by an excellent\u000a      field of participants joining a conference held in Exeter in 2010 in\u000a      anticipation of the bi-centenary of Gutzkow's birth; the proceedings were\u000a      then published on the bi-centenary in March 2011 (3.2) with the\u000a      support of Forum Vorm&#228;rz Forschung, one of the leading literary\u000a      societies for the 19th century. Vonhoff is currently working on\u000a      Gutzkow's novellas and literary criticism with the aim of enlarging the\u000a      understanding of the innovative contexts of the 1830s. His major\u000a      Leverhulme-funded research project (3.7) focuses on widening the\u000a      reception of narrative prose after 1850 and will help to re-establish\u000a      Gutzkow's place within our memory of the 19th century.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38704","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact 1: Educational Practices and Policy\u000a    Boughton's and Coveney's research has helped shape educational practices\u000a      and policy, specifically with regard to the teaching of both French\u000a      Linguistics (in H.E.) and practical French Language (H.E. and schools).\u000a    Partly because of the social and\/or communicative significance of the\u000a      topics they analyse, several research publications by Coveney and Boughton\u000a      feature prominently on syllabuses and reading lists for advanced\u000a      undergraduate\/graduate courses in French Sociolinguistics at universities\u000a      in the UK and abroad (5.1). Coveney's research has also impacted on\u000a      major textbooks for French linguistics and of general sociolinguistics,\u000a      which have been widely used in 2008-13. He is the third most frequently\u000a      cited researcher in French: A linguistic introduction (Fagyal et\u000a      al., C.U.P, 2006), and has more publications in the bibliography than any\u000a      other French specialist, apart from Fagyal herself; he is the most\u000a      extensively cited researcher on European French in Sociolinguistics:\u000a        method and interpretation (Milroy &amp; Gordon, Blackwell, 2003);\u000a      his results on ne-omission are the principal example of\u000a      quantitative research on French presented by F. Gadet in her popular\u000a      textbook, La variation sociale en fran&#231;ais (2nd ed.,\u000a      Ophrys, 2007). Coveney's impact in teaching resources is further\u000a      exemplified by the reading and correcting he has done for major textbooks\u000a      (as confirmed in the Acknowledgements or Prefaces), which have continued\u000a      to be widely used throughout 2008-13: Exploring the French Language\u000a      (Lodge et al., Arnold, 1997), described as \"accessible to students while\u000a      at the same time providing a wealth of sound, up-to-date information on\u000a      linguistic principles and methods\" in French Review (the journal\u000a      of the American Association of Teachers of French); The French\u000a        Language Today (Battye, Hintze &amp; Rowlett, Routledge, 2nd\u000a      edition 2000), which the reviewer on Linguist List considered to\u000a      be \"an excellent introduction to French linguistics\"; and Sociolinguistics:\u000a        method and interpretation (Milroy &amp; Gordon, Blackwell, 2003),\u000a      described by a reviewer on Amazon as \"a valuable resource not only for\u000a      students but also for experienced researchers\".\u000a    The web pages of the Committee for Linguistics in Education, a resource\u000a      for the training and support of teachers of Modern Foreign Languages\u000a      (launched in 2007) includes a link, in the section on `French: variation\u000a      and sociolinguistics', to a Guardian article on Boughton's\u000a      research on social-regional accent variation. Coveney contributed a\u000a      significant amount of the other material on French linguistics and\u000a      sociolinguistics to this web page, which had 6,518 hits between 1.1.08 and\u000a      31.7.13, according to StatCounter.com. (For corroboration, see 5.2.)\u000a      The influence of Coveney's work on French phonetics (3.4) is\u000a      acknowledged in a significant DVD resource for French pronunciation\u000a      practice, available in both French-language and English-language versions,\u000a      aimed at learners in H.E. and schools, respectively (5.3). The\u000a      resource's website states that Coveney (2001) was one of the main\u000a      scholarly sources used in the development of the course. (The author of\u000a      the DVDs reports that 1,100 sets of them were sold up to 31.7.13.)\u000a    A 2009 assessment of language teaching practices (Etienne &amp; Sax,\u000a      `Stylistic Variation in French: Bridging the Gap Between Research and\u000a      Textbooks', The Modern Language Journal, 93\/4, 584-606), discusses\u000a      how stylistic variation is treated in current French language textbooks,\u000a      concluding that insufficient attention is paid to non-standard variants\u000a      (such as on for `we', and ne-omission). The authors argue\u000a      for greater focus on stylistic variation, referring extensively to\u000a      Coveney's research (e.g 3.3), thereby confirming its impact in the\u000a      field of language learning.\u000a    Impact 2: Social Cohesion through Language\u000a    Linguistic research has policy implications for social cohesion and\u000a      well-being, language contact situations, and immigration. As a result of\u000a      his on-going research (leading to 3.5, for example), Goglia was\u000a      invited in 2008 to advise on linguistic aspects of a pilot programme on\u000a      African culture for children of African immigrants in the Veneto, Italy (5.4).\u000a      His expertise in language contact in immigrant communities helped inform\u000a      public educational policy as part of a scheme to enhance social cohesion\u000a      through improved educational attainment among disadvantaged immigrant\u000a      groups. He advised specifically on the most appropriate medium of\u000a      instruction, resulting in the eventual choice of English over Italian or\u000a      West African pidgin English.\u000a    Coveney's research publications led to him giving key advice and support\u000a      for the initial phase (September 2006 to mid-2008) of a new\u000a      sociolinguistic survey of Parisian speech (5.5). His letter of\u000a      support for the project helped unlock funding of 12,000 euros from the\u000a      Mayor of Paris' public research initiative, aimed at improving social\u000a      welfare and social cohesion: the website of this initiative specifies\u000a      priorities such as cultural heritage, integration and solidarity. The\u000a      sociolinguistic survey gave rise to a website with a substantial set of\u000a      recordings and transcripts, in which a cross-section of Parisians speak of\u000a      their experience of living in different districts of Paris. From its\u000a      creation in May 2009, the project's web-site had 16,071 visits (the site's\u000a      web counter).\u000a    Impact 3: Public Appreciation of Language Matters\u000a    Coveney's research has also contributed to the enhancement of the public\u000a      appreciation of spoken French. His work on interrogatives (e.g. 3.3)\u000a      was referred to several times during a 2011 Radio France\u000a        Internationale broadcast, on variation in French questions (5.6).\u000a      The programme's guest, a French Professor of Linguistics, explained that\u000a      Coveney's research has shown, for example, how different interrogative\u000a      structures in French are not interchangeable for all communicative\u000a      functions.

Their focus is on real language in its social\u000a      context, paying particular attention to non-standard and immigrant speech\u000a      varieties, and drawing on extensive corpora and experimental types of\u000a      data. An important aim is to enhance the public perception of such\u000a      varieties and of multilingualism, and to combat the negative stereotypes\u000a      and stigmatization that are often associated with them and the communities\u000a      concerned.\u000a    Aspects of the research also aim to make information about the nature of\u000a      real, everyday language available to those involved with the teaching and\u000a      learning of these languages. Important findings from the research concern\u000a      the systematic nature of non-standard and contact-based varieties, issues\u000a      of social mobility and cohesion, and the integration of immigrants into\u000a      communities. The relevance of the research to real-world issues is\u000a      reflected in, for example, the invitation to Goglia, referred to in Impact\u000a      2.\u000a    In the field of language variation, Boughton's research focuses\u000a      on diversity and processes of uniformisation in social-regional accents\u000a      within France, and how the accents are perceived. She has demonstrated\u000a      that accent levelling in north-west France is greater than in the\u000a      north-east (3.1) and that the use of authentic speech stimuli in\u000a      tests of accent identification and evaluation reveals discrepancies\u000a      between real and imagined difference, thereby undermining stereotypical,\u000a      potentially harmful, attitudes towards accents (3.2). Coveney's\u000a      main focus is on variation in the grammar and pragmatics of spoken French,\u000a      especially forms and structures that have strong communicative and social\u000a      significance (e.g. 3.3). His work on interrogatives, negation,\u000a      subject doubling and subject pronouns has demonstrated the frequency with\u000a      which non-standard forms are used in everyday speech in France, together\u000a      with aspects of their social differentiation, and the linguistic and\u000a      pragmatic factors influencing speakers' choices. Coveney's monograph on\u000a      French articulatory phonetics (3.4) analysed instrumental evidence\u000a      for variations in articulation (including intersegmental coordination),\u000a      and reviewed social and regional variation at different points in the\u000a      phonological system.\u000a    Research on contact linguistics and multilingualism in Italy is conducted\u000a      by Goglia, who has investigated communicative strategies\u000a      (including code-switching) in Italian spoken by Igbo-Nigerian immigrants\u000a      in Padua, as a case of non-guided adult language acquisition (3.5).\u000a      He has also worked on the project `Emerging Multilingualism in Italy',\u000a      examining language use among children with immigrant backgrounds. This\u000a      study is among the first to explore the role of Veneto dialect (a regional\u000a      language), alongside Italian and immigrant languages in the linguistic\u000a      repertoire of children of immigrant origin. These projects in contact\u000a      linguistics have attracted several grants (3.ii - 3.vi).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38713","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Increased public understanding of medieval game cultures and European\u000d\u000a        manuscript production (Impact 1)\u000d\u000a    Based on her research into manuscript culture, Cayley won\u000d\u000a      REACT-HEIF funding (&#163;6,250), and a REACT Project fund grant (&#163;30K) to\u000d\u000a      create an iPad App to introduce school age pupils (Years 6-13) to medieval\u000d\u000a      manuscript culture and to the celebrated Exeter Book (c. 950) in\u000d\u000a      particular.

The initial stages of the project saw over 2,000 individuals\u000d\u000a      explore and engage with their medieval cultural history. A previous public\u000d\u000a      exhibition (`The Treasures of Exeter Cathedral Library and Archives',\u000d\u000a      July- September 2009; c.7,350 visitors over 7 weeks) organised jointly by\u000d\u000a      Cayley and the Cathedral to coincide with the Eleventh Biennial Early Book\u000d\u000a      Society Conference held at Exeter from 9-12th July 2009\u000d\u000a      (selected papers were published as part of item 3.1), laid the groundwork\u000d\u000a      for further collaboration between the University and Cathedral which has\u000d\u000a      culminated in mutually beneficial research and grant income. Following\u000d\u000a      Cayley's involvement, Exeter Cathedral secured a Heritage Lottery Fund\u000d\u000a      (HLF) of &#163;763,000 to support the Cathedral's education and learning\u000d\u000a      programmes over three years (from Dec 2011-14). This followed a previous\u000d\u000a      award from the HLF in October 2010 of &#163;45,800. Exeter Cathedral used\u000d\u000a      recent collaborations with the University, including that with Cayley, as\u000d\u000a      part of their application materials. The grants have enabled the creation\u000d\u000a      of a dedicated education space in the Cathedral for the first time, and\u000d\u000a      the employment of specialist education and archives staff.

The festival, which combined\u000d\u000a      productions of well-known plays by Samuel Beckett with a range of scripted\u000d\u000a      and devised work by professional and amateur groups, was conceived in\u000d\u000a      dialogue with community groups including Clyst Vale Community College,\u000d\u000a      Exeter College and Uncommon Players. Jones engaged with practitioners in\u000d\u000a      preparation for the festival, bringing a research perspective to\u000d\u000a      productions of Endgame and Breath. Jones acted as academic\u000d\u000a      advisor to the Festival Director, and fed insights from Jones 3.5 into the\u000d\u000a      staging of Breath (dir. Bull), conceiving the piece as straddling\u000d\u000a      installation and performance spheres. The Festival Director confirms the\u000d\u000a      value of Jones' research to his staging of the performances, \"Discussing\u000d\u000a      your insights into Beckett's pre-occupations was helpful to me in the\u000d\u000a      period of early rehearsals, challenging [...] my thinking, and your\u000d\u000a      participation in the discussion sessions added some serious theoretical\u000d\u000a      gravitas to our programme, which was borne out in the interest shown in\u000d\u000a      the discussion itself\" (email cited in 5.7). In the wider conception of\u000d\u000a      the festival, the creation of `Beckett's Snug' brought discussion of\u000d\u000a      Krapp's Last Tape into the space of the auditorium and helped\u000d\u000a      bridge the divide between practitioners, academic and audience by hosting\u000d\u000a      sessions like `Fervent Thoughts' and further post-show discussions.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research led by Cayley (the Exeter Manuscripts Project) has enhanced\u000d\u000a      appreciation of medieval manuscript culture, drawing upon unique Exeter\u000d\u000a      holdings, and has increased public understanding of medieval game\u000d\u000a        cultures and European manuscript production (Impact 1).

Her\u000d\u000a      previous publications on French, English, and broader European medieval\u000d\u000a      manuscript culture, funded by bodies such as the Leverhulme Trust\u000d\u000a      (Research Fellowship 2007) underpin this new project. Cayley has\u000d\u000a      considerable expertise in text-editing, codicology and palaeography:\u000d\u000a      skills which she brings to a sector that understands the benefits of\u000d\u000a      academic input and content in driving forward innovation and\u000d\u000a      functionality. In 2011, Cayley secured seedcorn funding (from the Exeter\u000d\u000a      Open Innovation Platform's Link Fund) to develop a relationship with\u000d\u000a      Antenna International, a global leader in handheld audio and multimedia\u000d\u000a      tours that help museums, historic and cultural sites and national parks\u000d\u000a      shape and enrich their visitors' experiences. This led to a pilot project\u000d\u000a      funded by REACT-HEIF, and then a significant injection of funding from the\u000d\u000a      AHRC-funded REACT hub through a collaborative PhD studentship and a REACT\u000d\u000a      Project Fund grant to develop a prototype App. Cayley is working in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Antenna International to create the App which will\u000d\u000a      reveal the secrets of medieval literature to a new audience.\u000d\u000a    Professor Hugh Roberts' (Personal Chair; appointed 2005)\u000d\u000a      collaborative AHRC-funded research on obscenity in Renaissance France, his\u000d\u000a      critical edition (3.3), with Dr Annette Tomarken (Miami University of\u000d\u000a      Ohio, retired), of the early seventeenth-century French comedian known as\u000d\u000a      Bruscambille, and his work on his current AHRC research grant, `Gossip and\u000d\u000a      Nonsense: Excessive Language in Renaissance France' (Co-Investigator, Dr\u000d\u000a      Emily Butterworth, King's College London), all underpin his impact-related\u000d\u000a      activities. In addition to an open access database of French Renaissance\u000d\u000a      obscenities, Roberts is collaborating with an Exeter-based artist, who is\u000d\u000a      creating striking adaptations of obscenities, as well as nonsense, in\u000d\u000a      visual form (see details in 4 below). For instance, Roberts' philological\u000d\u000a      research into Bruscambille's printed speeches has revealed a large number\u000d\u000a      of often hitherto unknown French expressions, which have proved suggestive\u000d\u000a      for visual re- interpretation, as has an early seventeenth-century\u000d\u000a      nonsense love poem, which Roberts uncovered in a manuscript in Paris (see,\u000d\u000a      e.g. http:\/\/gossipandnonsense.exeter.ac.uk\/?p=278).\u000d\u000a    Professor David Jones (Associate Professor; appointed 2005) has\u000d\u000a      published widely on Samuel Beckett, trauma, the archive and\u000d\u000a      intermediality, and the impact recorded here is underpinned by AHRC-funded\u000d\u000a      research (AHRC Research Leave, 2007-08). The intermedial methodologies\u000d\u000a      elaborated in Samuel Beckett and Testimony (2011) were\u000d\u000a      subsequently developed in new contexts. In particular, 3.5 demonstrates\u000d\u000a      the convergence between the `archival' strategies of Beckett's work, in\u000d\u000a      which personal objects are the prosthetic foil to failing memory, and\u000d\u000a      works of installation art. Just as Christian Boltanski mimics the archival\u000d\u000a      preservation of personal effects, Beckett explicitly dramatises the\u000d\u000a      situation of the self-archivist in Krapp's Last Tape. Jones'\u000d\u000a      continuing work on visual archives has led to a major award under EU\u000d\u000a      INTERREG IV (&#8364;1 million approx); within the project 1914FACES2014\u000d\u000a      (2012-15), Jones is currently working with artist Paddy Hartley and with\u000d\u000a      the Archives d&#233;partementales de la Somme.

The work\u000a      was drawn into the public sphere by the growing electoral success of\u000a      right-wing populists in Europe, including in countries such as Finland,\u000a      France and the UK, as well as their accession to government (or\u000a      availability to provide external support to governments), in countries\u000a      such as Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland. In the\u000a      specific cases of Italy and Finland, the research gained particular\u000a      relevance following, respectively, the accession to power of the Northern\u000a      League alongside Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom in 2008, and the\u000a      electoral success of the True Finns in 2011. In light of such\u000a      developments, Albertazzi's work, already well known in the public domain,\u000a      attracted increased interest (source 3) from journalists and left-wing\u000a      parties\/organisations seeking critical reflection on the nature of\u000a      right-wing populism, as well as the strategies the left should deploy to\u000a      respond to the actions of populists in government and\/or their electoral\u000a      success. The impact of the research, further discussed and evidenced in\u000a      the two sections below, was thus to a large extent driven by its\u000a      consumers.\u000a    1) Improving public understanding of contemporary European populism by\u000a        influencing media reports, including those reaching policy makers.\u000a    Albertazzi has been relied upon as a source of expertise by\u000a      journalists\/media practitioners, and has established a sustained\u000a      relationship with prominent organisations which regularly draw on his\u000a      research when covering the parties he writes about. These include, among\u000a      newspapers and magazines: in the UK, The Observer (which quoted\u000a      from Twenty-First Century Populism in its editorial of 30th\u000a      March 2013), The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph; in\u000a      Italy, La Stampa and Liberazione; in Brasil, O Estado\u000a        de S. Paulo; in China, Sanlian Life Weekly Magazine; and, in\u000a      Finland, Helsingin Sanomat. Moreover, Albertazzi has also commented\u000a      on right-wing populism for Italian, British and Australian public service\u000a      broadcasters, Radio France Internationale, Channel NewsAsia and the\u000a      newsletter of `The Civic Institute', a think-tank financed by the Polish\u000a      political party `The Civic Platform'. The impact of Albertazzi's work on\u000a      media practitioners and their audiences is evidenced by the many emails\u000a      and letters he has received from journalists (source 3). For instance, a\u000a      journalist writing for De Groene Amsterdammer (The Netherlands),\u000a      stated that Albertazzi provided him with very useful analysis on populism,\u000a      which allowed him to show that `the PVV [i.e. the Party of Freedom] is\u000a        not an isolated Dutch phenomenon and that there are similarities between\u000a        European nations'. Two interviews given by Albertazzi to De\u000a        Groene Amsterdammer were copied and distributed among all Dutch MPs\u000a      in the daily `Reader of media articles' produced for Dutch\u000a      Parliamentarians. The first of these interviews was also quoted\u000a      extensively by one Dutch MP in his blog; the second saw a very high number\u000a      of responses on the magazine's website (source 3). Further proof of impact\u000a      is provided by the statements made by a journalist writing for Vremya\u000a        Zavishennih Trebovaniy &#8212; a high profile newsletter through which\u000a      ideas were discussed in the period leading to the Global Policy Forum:\u000a      'The Modern State in the Age of Social Diversity', held in Yaroslavl\u000a      (Russia) in September 2011. The journalist said that Albertazzi `provided\u000a      insight into the nature and characteristics of populism in Europe and helped\u000a        the audience gain a better understanding of the detachment between\u000a        voters and &lt;&lt;the elites&gt;&gt;' (source 3). Copies of Vremya\u000a        Zavishennih Trebovaniy featuring Albertazzi's interview were\u000a      distributed to Russian policy makers, including the Administration of the\u000a      Russian Presidency, and other government institutions, with about 3000\u000a      copies being sent to experts on international politics around the world. A\u000a      journalist writing for the magazine Marteen!, argues that\u000a      Albertazzi's availability to discuss populism helped her to `understand\u000a        more of the nature of populism in the UK and the different\u000a      definitions that are used when discussing populism', while a reporter from\u000a      O Estado de S. Paulo (Brazil) states that, by contacting\u000a      Albertazzi, she developed a better understanding of `the political\u000a        context in Italy that time' [i.e. under the fourth Berlusconi\u000a      government].\u000a    2) Influencing political debate in Italy and Finland. The success\u000a      of right-wing populist parties in Italy and Finland in recent years has\u000a      spurred interest in Albertazzi's research among observers of these\u000a      countries' politics, leading to invitations to contribute to high-profile\u000a      events attended by diverse audiences, which have impacted on political\u000a      debates in these countries. The following are prominent examples of such\u000a      events:\u000a    a) The One-day Conference: `Berlusconi and Beyond: Prospects For Italy',\u000a      held in Birmingham on 12 February 2010, and organised by The Open\u000a      University. Albertazzi participated as a roundtable panellist, alongside\u000a      speakers such as the former editor of The Economist, Bill Emmott.\u000a      The event was attended by journalists from La Stampa, La\u000a        Repubblica and Liberazione, academics, think- tank\u000a      researchers, students and the general public (audience c. 60), and focused\u000a      on the strategies adopted by Italian populists in government from 2001\u000a      onwards. The discussion, which uncovered the lack of an effective strategy\u000a      by the Italian opposition to the Berlusconi government, led to the\u000a      compilation by panellists of a list of `Ten questions for Italy's\u000a      opposition'. Due to the exposure enjoyed by the event in the Italian media\u000a      &#8212; the list was published by four Italian newspapers, including the best\u000a      selling La Stampa and La Repubblica &#8212; Enrico Letta, then\u000a      vice-chairman of the major party of opposition, the Democratic Party,\u000a      agreed to be interviewed on the matter by La Stampa. In the\u000a      interview, published on 14 February, Letta provided answers to each of the\u000a      `Ten questions' raised at the conference, thus publicly reflecting on his\u000a      party's response to the populist challenge in the country, its identity\u000a      and policy proposals. It was the first time that a very prominent Italian\u000a      politician &#8212; Letta eventually became prime minister in April 2013 &#8212; agreed\u000a      to engage directly and publicly with criticism of his party voiced at an\u000a      event of this nature. The public debate on these matters continued in the\u000a      following days, ignited by Letta's response, and led to a lively debate\u000a      about the strategies of the Italian Left. For instance: the `Ten\u000a      questions' were published in Italian on one of La Stampa's\u000a      official blogs and were commented upon by 60 readers (source 4), while on\u000a      the Open Democracy website the English translation of the `Ten questions'\u000a      attracted a further 19 comments from readers across the world (ibid.). In\u000a      addition to this, La Stampa's editorial of 21 February was also\u000a      dedicated to Letta's response.\u000a    b) On 10 November 2011, Albertazzi gave a key-note address to the\u000a      conference `6th Research and Policy Days &#8212; the State of\u000a      Democracy', organised at the Parliament House in Helsinki (audience c.\u000a      120). The event was organised by two think-tanks funded by Social\u000a      Democratic parties: The Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS)\u000a      and the Kalevi Sorsa Foundation. Speakers included: the former Social\u000a      Democratic Prime Minister of Finland and Candidate in the Presidential\u000a      Elections of 2012, Paavo Lipponen, members of the Finnish Parliament, and\u000a      policy analysts from a variety of European organisations and think tanks.\u000a      In the words of one of the organisers, conference attendees came `from a\u000a      variety of backgrounds, ranging from party activists, politicians and\u000a      policy makers, to representatives from civil society organisations, NGOs,\u000a      trade unions and people with an academic background' (source 1).\u000a      Albertazzi's contribution, based on article R6 focused on the consequences\u000a      of populist rule for Liberal Democracy and the strategies Social\u000a      Democratic parties should adopt in responding to the populist challenge. The\u000a        discussion contributed to political debate in Finland in the period\u000a        leading to the Presidential election of January 2012, which was also\u000a      contested by the populist True Finns party. The media provided extensive\u000a      coverage of the event (source 1), with Helsingin Sanomat\u000a      interviewing Albertazzi on the nature and characteristics of populism in\u000a      Europe.\u000a    c) On 25 November 2011 Albertazzi delivered a key-note speech informed by\u000a      the findings of his Twenty-First Century Populism (R1) to the\u000a      conference `Populismo in Europa', a two-day event held in Rome and\u000a      funded by Italy's largest Union, the CGIL (audience c. 200). The\u000a      conference brought together members of civil society such as Union\u000a      representatives, political activists, researchers, academics and students\u000a      to interrogate the impact of right-wing populists in government on social,\u000a      welfare and immigration policies, as well as the left's response to them.\u000a      According to the organiser of the event (source 2), it provided `a very\u000a        useful forum for a thorough analysis of policies promoted by populists'.\u000a      Its proceedings were published in a special issue of La Rivista\u000a        Italiana delle Politiche Sociali and were made available on U-Tube,\u000a      where Albertazzi's contribution has been seen by 108 users so far (source\u000a      5).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The principal forms of impact flowing from this body of research lie in\u000a      two interconnected areas:\u000a    a) Improving public understanding of right-wing populism, by\u000a      influencing how journalists around the world and their international\u000a      audiences, including policy makers, have interpreted its success in Europe\u000a      and its characteristics (see source 3 below);\u000a    b) Informing political debate in Italy and Finland concerning\u000a      populist parties and the strategies the Left should adopt in response to\u000a      the actions of populists in government (sources 1 and 2). By contributing\u000a      to such debates, the research has influenced the way members of\u000a      civil society (such as trade unionists and NGO activists, among others)\u000a      see right-wing populism in the aforementioned countries.

The outcomes that have led to the impact\u000a      have derived mainly from the analysis of the structural factors that have\u000a      facilitated the emergence of successful right-wing populist parties in\u000a      some countries, the discussion of the agency of party leaders, the study\u000a      of the relationship between leaders and the grassroots and the examination\u000a      of the actions of populists in power (especially the policies they pursue,\u000a      their relationships with coalition partners and their communications\u000a      strategies). The main conclusions of this work have attracted the\u000a      attention of researchers, members of civil society, policy makers and\u000a      media practitioners, thus leading to the impact. They can be summarized as\u000a      follows:\u000a    (1) Right-wing populists are not necessarily destined to suffer electoral\u000a      decline or internal splits as a result of participating in government.\u000a      This is due to their ability to achieve some at least of their key goals\u000a      whilst in power.\u000a    (2) A crucial factor determining the success of right-wing populists in\u000a      government is their ability to focus strongly on a small selection of key\u000a      themes and impose a framework of interpretation of events regarding these\u000a      on their lower representative ranks and grassroots members;\u000a    (3) Parties such as the Northern League in Italy and the Swiss People's\u000a      Party still rely heavily on voluntary work done by activists. This is\u000a      essential to their success;\u000a    (4) Right-wing populists have posed serious threats to fundamental\u000a      principles of Liberal Democracy through their actions in government. These\u000a      have been highlighted and discussed by the research.\u000a    Some of these findings contradict the conclusions reached by much of the\u000a      available literature on populism. In particular, the research: a) challenges\u000a      the claim that government participation tends to negatively affect the\u000a      electoral performance of right-wing populists and the very unity of their\u000a      parties; b) questions the alleged ineffectiveness of right-wing\u000a      populists in the field of policy making; c) demonstrates the\u000a      crucial importance of activism and of effective communication between\u000a      leaders and the grass roots for the success of some of the parties\u000a      analysed.\u000a    The research was carried out by Daniele Albertazzi, permanent member of\u000a      staff at Birmingham, either as sole or as principal investigator. Duncan\u000a      McDonnell, an externally funded research fellow at Birmingham between 2008\u000a      and 2010, and honorary research fellow from 2011 onwards, collaborated in\u000a      the researching\/writing of some of the outputs listed in Section 3. Resisting\u000a        the Tide (R2) was co-edited with two members of the UoA (Clodagh\u000a      Brook and Charlotte Ross); R6 mentioned in Section 3 was co-written with\u000a      Sean M&#252;ller (University of Kent). The research was carried out from 2004\u000a      onwards, and is still ongoing. It has been conducted mainly through the\u000a      following methods:\u000a    \u000a      Study of party archives and media material;\u000a      Analysis of selected policies and legislative proposals, leader\u000a        statements, media appearances, speeches and electoral data;\u000a      Extensive use of interviews, focus groups and questionnaires with\u000a        representatives and grassroots members from relevant parties.\u000a    \u000a    The latter is the most significant (and original) aspect of the research\u000a      methodology, since little attention has been paid so far to the study of\u000a      party members at the micro level, and even less specifically to the views\u000a      and values of the members of right-wing populist parties. The research has\u000a      uncovered the experiences of members within the selected parties and their\u000a      views concerning the strategies deployed by their organisations\u000a      (especially when in government).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38885","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Nature and extent of the impact:\u000a      Given the persistence of widespread homophobia on most levels of Italian\u000a      society, and its overt\u000a      and covert endorsement from many quarters (Church, press, politicians,\u000a      everyday rumour-mills), it\u000a      is obviously very difficult to influence public attitudes, language and\u000a      practices. For related reasons,\u000a      organised action for change in Italy has secured fewer changes to\u000a      legislation than elsewhere. Yet\u000a      precisely these difficulties indicate the importance of any impact that\u000a      can be achieved through\u000a      research and related activities. Two main avenues are open to\u000a      interventionist thinking in this area.\u000a      One involves working directly with members of the LGBTQ population in\u000a      specific locations. The\u000a      other lies in targeting key opinion-formers and helping them better to\u000a      understand the nature of the\u000a      problems and the reasons for their persistence and, in consequence, to\u000a      develop new forms of\u000a      discourse and actions aimed at incremental change. This case study claims\u000a      only that the research\u000a      and the social actions related to it have contributed demonstrably to what\u000a      is likely to be a very long\u000a      and slow process of re-shaping public consciousness. It has done so in the\u000a      following ways:\u000a    a) It has supported LGBTQ community initiatives. Ross's research (R3) has\u000a      contributed to\u000a      renewed activity in community initiatives such as the lesbian\u000a      cultural centre and housing\u000a      provision for older lesbians currently being developed by the Associazione\u000a      Desiderandae in Bari.\u000a      The 21 lesbian-identified participants in the research told her explicitly\u000a      that discussions with her\u000a      and her analysis of their experiences had inspired them to invest more\u000a      energy in the project and to\u000a      adopt a more critically-reflexive approach to the initiatives that they\u000a      are planning [see source 2\u000a      below]. One interviewee in Bari commented: `the material you are gathering\u000a      for this research will\u000a      become a useful tool for us in the future'. Another said that `the\u000a      fact that you are here, asking us\u000a      to reflect on our project Lesbizio, has already encouraged us to\u000a      get things moving again'. This\u000a      publication has also informed the Wikipedia article for `Imagined\u000a      Communities', thus enabling the\u000a      creation of a widely accessible online resource that pays attention\u000a      to LGBTQ rights and\u000a      cultures.\u000a    b) It has helped LGBTQ individuals to meet societal challenges and\u000a      thereby improved their well-being.\u000a      Ross's research has been widely disseminated, for example through free\u000a      public events,\u000a      using social media, and through her bilingual Italian\/English blog. The\u000a      published research has\u000a      informed the content of 6 free public talks and events in\u000a        Italian and English. As a result, it has\u000a      impacted positively on the well-being of a variegated demographic in\u000a      several ways. The talk that\u000a      she gave in Bologna in April 2013, on `lesbian' literature was felt to be\u000a      important both for lesbians\u000a      and women in Italy more broadly, since it galvanised groups and\u000a      individuals who feel\u000a      disenfranchised by national politics and the mainstream media [7].The blog\u000a      has had a positive\u000a      effect on some individuals' self esteem. One follower commented: `It makes\u000a      me feel stronger\u000a        about my identity, knowing this research is happening and being\u000a      discussed'. Ross's talks as part\u000a      of the Shout Festival of Queer Culture in Birmingham have contributed to\u000a      the success of this\u000a      initiative in improving the well-being, self-confidence, self-esteem,\u000a        health, feeling of security\u000a        and social integration of LGBTQ individuals in the Midland area.\u000a      Research on the impact of\u000a      the festival indicates that it has had a positive effect on those who\u000a      attended events, but also on\u000a      those who simply knew about them, as well as on their families, friends\u000a      and associates. It has\u000a      enabled more transparent cultural discussion of issues that are often\u000a      treated as though they are\u000a      somehow shameful, and contributed to lowering levels of social isolation,\u000a      depression, and alcohol\u000a      use (see report Worth Every Penny, [8] below).\u000a    c) It has increased public awareness and understanding of human\u000a      rights infringements\u000a      experienced by LGBTQ individuals in Italy. Individuals with whom Ross has\u000a      developed\u000a      relationships and shared her research since 2006 have confirmed that her\u000a      analysis has had a\u000a      positive effect on their understanding of LGBTQ cultures and\u000a      experiences in Italy, enabling them\u000a      to gain a new\/different\/more nuanced and theoretically-informed view. The\u000a      following public talks\u000a      have been delivered: a discussion in Italian at the Circolo Mario Mieli, a\u000a      Rome-based LGBT\u000a      association, March 2011; a talk in Italian as part of a study day on\u000a      lesbian histories in Italy,\u000a      Florence February 2011 (webcast available online, [1]); a talk in English\u000a      as part of the Birmingham\u000a      Shout Festival, November 2011; a talk in Italian on lesbian cultural\u000a      visibility at the `Immaginaria'\u000a      cinema festival, as part of Lesbiche Fuori salone, Milan, November 2012; a\u000a      discussion in English of\u000a      a documentary on lesbian representation in the Italian media as part of\u000a      the Birmingham Shout\u000a      festival, March 2013; a talk on `lesbian' literature in Bologna, April\u000a      2013. Ross also disseminates\u000a      her research in both English and Italian via her blog ([6]). This\u000a      includes posts, film reviews,\u000a      reflections on her work and an opportunity for comment. While audiences\u000a      for the talks have been\u000a      relatively small on the whole (25-150), making the research available\u000a      through the web has\u000a      increased its reach: the page featuring the webcast of the talk given in\u000a      February 2011 has had\u000a      57,874 visitors (September 2013); the blog has had 4,149 visits. These\u000a      visitors are mostly based in\u000a      the UK or Italy, but some are based in other countries, including Japan\u000a      and Iran (statistics available\u000a      on request).Audiences and followers have commented on the lack of\u000a      available literature on this\u000a      topic and thanked Ross for opening up channels of debate: `I am finding\u000a      [the blog] a very\u000a      interesting and important project as it really does fill a big gap'\u000a      [6]. One heterosexual respondent\u000a      explained that reading the blog had helped him\/her to rethink his\/her\u000a        attitude towards lesbians in\u000a      relation to broader culture: `the blog is challenging my prejudice that\u000a      lesbianism = `inward-looking\u000a      culture' [6]. This remark shows how the research has deconstructed\u000a      ungrounded assumptions that\u000a      may be held by the broader population about the inward-looking character\u000a      of lesbian culture.\u000a      Responses to questionnaires for the Shout talk on `lesbian' literature\u000a      (November 2011 [4])\u000a      confirmed that audience members had learnt a great deal about lesbian\u000a      cultural representation in\u000a      Italy. Respondents declared that they would broaden their reading\u000a        practices and seek out the\u000a        texts discussed that are available in English translation (novels\u000a      and dvds with subtitles). They\u000a      explained that they had been inspired to reflect on how the Italian texts\u000a      relate to their own\u000a      experiences and readings from different cultures. One attendee noted: `As\u000a      an Asian it has ignited\u000a      my interest in tracing Asian lesbian historical depictions'. In\u000a      conversation with Ross, attendees\u000a      confirmed that they had not previously been aware of the disparity between\u000a      the legal rights and\u000a      standing of LGBTQ individuals in the UK and in Italy. Similar comments\u000a      were made during the\u000a      discussion of the documentary that Ross chaired for Shout in March 2013.\u000a      Respondents to an\u000a      event questionnaire [5] stated that it had made them `much more aware\u000a      of the homophobia in\u000a      Italy'. It inspired a thirst for more information: `it made me want to\u000a        research it [lesbian\u000a      representation in Italy] and find out more'. It sparked a desire to think\u000a      in more detail about `visibility\u000a      issues and media shaping of the discourse [on lesbian identity]'. These\u000a      events challenged\u000a      assumptions that the experiences of LGBTQ individuals are roughly\u000a      comparable across Europe\u000a      and stimulated audiences to do their own research on the subject.\u000a    d) It has generated publications and debates on the incorporation\u000a      of the term `queer' in Italian\u000a      discourses. Ross's peer reviewed publications (2010), have led to a\u000a      discussion on the reception\u000a      and adoption of the Anglophone term `queer' in Italy. Part of this debate\u000a      has been published as\u000a      Queer in Italia, ed Marco Pustianaz (Pisa: Edizioni ETS, 2011),\u000a      involving the participation of 21\u000a      activists and scholars. This book is aimed at a general audience\u000a      and has been presented to the\u000a      public in Rome and other major Italian cities. It is widely available in\u000a      bookshops and on the web.\u000a      References in the book Queer In Italia state that the project was\u000a      inspired by the special issue of\u000a      Italian Studies which Ross co-edited and by questions that she\u000a      raised (p.143). A video of the\u000a      presentation of the book in Bologna, September 2011, is available on\u000a      YouTube and has been\u000a      viewed 236 times [3].\u000a    e) It has directly influenced the writing practice of a\u000a      contemporary Italian novelist and indirectly\u000a      her readership. Ross's research on lesbian literature, disseminated via\u000a      talks based on her\u000a      publications (e.g. 2012a above) has impacted on a contemporary novelist,\u000a      inspiring her to rethink\u000a      her approach to lesbian cultural representation: `you have had a\u000a        positive influence on my\u000a        creative process' [7]. Specifically, this novelist is rethinking her\u000a      current project in light of Ross's\u000a      reflections on the political importance of positive visibility for lesbian\u000a      populations. This direct\u000a      influence on cultural production will indirectly impact on the broader\u000a      readership of this novel.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research has had a demonstrable impact in Italy, in the UK, and\u000a      elsewhere, in the areas of\u000a      Civil Society, Public discourse, and Cultural Life.\u000a      Specifically, it has a) supported LGBTQ\u000a      community initiatives; b) helped LGBTQ individuals to meet societal\u000a      challenges and thereby\u000a      improved their well-being; c) increased public awareness and\u000a        understanding of human rights\u000a      infringements experienced by LGBTQ individuals in Italy; d) generated publications\u000a        and debates\u000a      on the incorporation of the term `queer' in Italian discourses; e)\u000a      directly influenced the writing\u000a        practice of a contemporary Italian novelist and indirectly her\u000a      readership.

Specifically, it\u000a      addresses an important but under-researched area of Italian social and\u000a      cultural life, namely the\u000a      lived experiences and social and cultural perceptions of LGBTQ\u000a      communities. By the innovative\u000a      application of cultural-analytic methods and by forging new critical\u000a      arguments, the work has thrown\u000a      critical light on the political and cultural discrimination of LGBTQ\u000a      individuals in Italy. The findings\u000a      demonstrate the persistence of widespread homophobic attitudes and\u000a      practices in this society\u000a      where, despite the provisions of the 1997 EU Amsterdam Treaty,\u000a      anti-discrimination legislation\u000a      remains inadequate and ineffective, so that LGBTQ individuals remain\u000a      vulnerable to frequent\u000a      discrimination, while same-sex couples still have no right to legal\u000a      recognition of their relationships.\u000a      Conversely, the research has also shown the positive role played by\u000a      cultural representation in\u000a      many forms in changing individual and collective perceptions of these\u000a      issues.\u000a    The research has included both textual analysis and ethnographic\u000a      fieldwork, which has taken the\u000a      form of interviews with members of activist communities, and innovative\u000a      Social Network Analysis of\u000a      a lesbian community in Bari. Ross conducted fieldwork in Turin, Bari,\u000a      Rome, Milan and Bologna,\u000a      which informed peer-reviewed publications on the following issues: 1) the\u000a      socio-cultural\u000a      construction of lesbian identities and lesbian cultural visibility in\u000a      Turin; 2) the relationship between\u000a      LGBTQ identifies and public spaces in Turin; 3) the political strategies\u000a      employed by LGBTQ activist\u000a      groups during Berlusconi's term as Prime Minister 2001-06; 4) initiatives\u000a      around lesbian and gay\u000a      ageing in Italy. Textual analysis includes critical evaluation of the\u000a      following: 5) discourses of\u000a      `lesbian' identities and desire between women in Italian literature; 6)\u000a      media representation of\u000a      gender and sexuality in Italy.\u000a    Through ethnographic fieldwork and the analysis of cultural\u000a      representations, the research has\u000a      revealed the importance of social and cultural visibility to LGBTQ\u000a      communities. Visibility functions\u000a      as a means of gaining socio-cultural status and recognition, which may\u000a      improve the `liveability' of\u000a      LGBTQ lives, by increasing confidence, facilitating `coming out' and\u000a      challenging homophobia.\u000a      Visibility may also lend vital strength to political campaigns to improve\u000a      human rights for these\u000a      populations. Through qualitative interviews with social actors, research\u000a      has explored the\u000a      relationship of LGBTQ populations to public spaces, showing how while the\u000a      majority of public\u000a      spaces in Italy are dominated by heteronormative and even homophobic\u000a      discourses, these\u000a      discourses can be challenged and subverted, for example through a pride\u000a      parade or a public\u000a      presence of LGBTQ populations (Ross 2013). This can have a positive effect\u000a      on the well-being of\u000a      such individuals. Through interviews with LGBTQ activists and politicians\u000a      as part of the British\u000a      Academy funded project `Resisting the Tide: Cultures of Opposition during\u000a      the Berlusconi Years',\u000a      Ross revealed and analysed the range of approaches adopted by activist\u000a      groups in their struggle\u000a      to secure improved human rights for LGBTQ communities in Italy (see output\u000a      R1 below). Further\u000a      qualitative interviews and Social Network Analysis have revealed how\u000a      lesbian and gay community\u000a      initiatives, in particular projects which seek to address the needs of\u000a      ageing populations, can\u000a      improve cultural transmission between generations, help isolated\u000a      individuals, through resilient\u000a      social networks that offer a model for wider society (R3). Textual\u000a      analyses have critiqued Italian\u000a      mainstream media for its narrow, homophobic approach to sexuality, and\u000a      discussed alternative\u000a      media forms, such as LGBTQ community magazines and websites. Ross has also\u000a      published\u000a      groundbreaking articles on the representation of lesbian identities and\u000a      desire between women in\u000a      Italian literature (R4).\u000a    The research was conducted at the University of Birmingham by Charlotte\u000a      Ross, Senior Lecturer in\u000a      Italian Studies, as sole author. She collaborated as co-editor with\u000a      Susanna Scarparo (Monash\u000a      University) for the 2010 special issue of Modern Italy (R4), and\u000a      with Daniele Albertazzi and\u000a      Clodagh Brook (both at University of Birmingham) on the volume Resisting\u000a        the Tide (R1).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38886","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The publication of the intensely personal testimonies of Guilarte and\u000a      Beneyto, together with other\u000a      forms of public engagement (including use of the film documentary), has added\u000a        to public\u000a        understanding of the Francoist period, but it has been particularly\u000a      effective in helping Franco's\u000a      victims share common experiences, and to discuss them with other\u000a      social groups and members\u000a      of younger generations, and has helped to promote dialogue about\u000a      new ways of responding to\u000a      the past. This comes at a crucial moment, as first-hand testimony is\u000a      becoming ever scarcer just\u000a      when the recovery of the past appears more urgent than ever. The fact that\u000a      each of the women\u000a      came from parts of Spain where fierce debates about centralism and\u000a      regional autonomy continue\u000a      unabated has added a further (often controversial) dimension to the\u000a      reception of their testimonies.\u000a      Thanks to the use of various platforms, the results of the research have\u000a      reached new (non-academic)\u000a      audiences at public events in Spain, Mexico and the UK; through viewings\u000a      of a film\u000a      documentary; and through an accompanying blog.\u000a    The strength of public interest in recent work on exile and the Civil War\u000a      is evident from the range of\u000a      institutions sponsoring the events at which Jato has sought to encourage\u000a        engagement with these\u000a      testimonies, and by the fact that the publication of Cuentos para d&#237;as\u000a        de lluvia was sponsored by\u000a      the Instituci&#243;n Alfonso El Magn&#225;nimo, funded by the Government of\u000a      Valencia, while the publication\u000a      of Un barco cargado de... was funded by Tolosa Council. The making\u000a      of essential contacts began\u000a      with an official Homage to Guilarte in November 2011 (where Jato was\u000a      invited to speak by Ana\u000a      Mar&#237;a Ruiz &#8212; Guilarte's daughter) sponsored by the Mayor and Deputy for\u000a      Culture of Tolosa and\u000a      attended by local residents who contributed valuable testimonies of their\u000a      own. The event resulted\u000a      in engagement with sections of the community interested in memorialisation\u000a      as a current social\u000a      and political process.\u000a    The second stage of public engagement involved fostering\u000a        reconciliatory dialogue with the\u000a        past through presentation of the `lost' memories in diverse fora.\u000a      Jato organised public discussions\u000a      of Un barco cargado de... and reading group activities on Cuentos\u000a        para d&#237;as de lluvia both in Spain\u000a      and the UK. In order to make the research and Guilarte's memories more\u000a      accessible to wider and\u000a      diverse audiences, Jato produced an accompanying film documentary [see\u000a      source 1 below]. Like\u000a      Guilarte's boat with its cargo of memories, the book and the film called\u000a      at various locations in Spain\u000a      and the UK, delivering her testimony and collecting new memories from the\u000a      participating public.\u000a      The accompanying blog acted to further engage the public with the\u000a      research, as well as providing a\u000a      forum for discussion, feedback and reflection upon the impact of these\u000a      activities on their perception\u000a      of the past [2]. In the period to July 2013, the blog had received almost\u000a      3000 hits since its creation\u000a      a year before [3].\u000a    The blog traced the journey of the boat\/book as it set off from the\u000a      Cultural Centre in Montorn&#233;s\u000a      (Catalonia, 28\/06\/2012) before travelling on to a variety of national\u000a      museums and local community\u000a      centres. These included:\u000a    \u000a      the Centro de Mayores Miguel de Cervantes, London (17\/10\/2012)\u000a      the Cultural Centre and the EPA (School of Adult Education) in Tolosa\u000a        in the Basque Country\u000a        (24\/10\/2012)\u000a      the Centre of the Anarchist Syndicate, San Sebastian (22\/12\/2012)\u000a      the Museum of History of Catalu&#241;a (Barcelona) (07\/02\/2013)\u000a      the Museum of Exile (La Junquera, Catalu&#241;a) (09\/02\/2013)\u000a      the Arts and Sciences Festival, University of Birmingham (18\/03\/2013)\u000a      the Universidad Aut&#243;noma de Barcelona, Bellaterra (04\/04\/2013)\u000a      the Centro de Personas Adultas de Santander (09\/04\/2013)\u000a    \u000a    Audiences were strictly non-academic members of the public, with a total\u000a      of over 300 people\u000a      attending. Feedback from audiences indicated that Jato's events and the\u000a      documentary screening\u000a      aided the recovery of memory, facilitated dialogue about and changed\u000a        opinions of exile [4].\u000a    The material was also incorporated into other public events where memory\u000a      work was an urgent\u000a      contemporary concern. Thus, for example, the film was shown throughout the\u000a      `Semana cultural\u000a      republicana' in Tolosa (8-14 April 2013). Jato's public talks at the\u000a      Museum of History of Catalunya\u000a      and the Museum of Exile were part of the cultural programme organised by\u000a      the `Memorial\u000a      Dem&#242;cratic de la Generalitat de Catalunya' a public institution `aiming to\u000a      recover, celebrate and\u000a      promote democratic memory between 1931 and 1980', including the\u000a      encouragement of inter-generational\u000a      dialogue.\u000a    The value of both testimonies for promoting trans-national\u000a      dialogue is demonstrated in two\u000a      ways. Firstly by the inclusion of the Guilarte documentary in the\u000a      commemorative events held in\u000a      Mexico to celebrate the 82nd Anniversary of the Proclamation of\u000a      the Spanish Second Republic,\u000a      hosted by the Ateneo Espa&#241;ol de M&#233;xico. Secondly, through a series of\u000a      reading events based\u000a      upon a translation of one of the stories from Beneyto's collection, \"Una\u000a      historia que es Historia\".\u000a      Organised by Jato, the story was used in the activities of four groups,\u000a      mainly of older readers, at\u000a      local libraries in Birmingham in Summer 2013 (Weoley Castle Library,\u000a      Erdington Library, Quinton\u000a      Library, Brasshouse Language Centre) leading participants to reflect\u000a        on women's wartime\u000a        experiences (including their own) [5]. Feedback from the groups (a\u000a      total of around 360\u000a      participants), also indicated improved understanding about the Spanish\u000a        Civil war and in\u000a        particular the challenges faced by women [5].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact of the research has been achieved principally in the areas of\u000a      education, public\u000a        awareness, political engagement, and the processes of\u000a        identity-formation in contemporary\u000a      Spanish society. This has been done by engaging the public with hitherto\u000a      suppressed material\u000a      from the Francoist period. Interaction with the target user groups has\u000a      been effected by making the\u000a      results of the research widely available on a range of platforms,\u000a      including: new annotated editions\u000a      of biographical and literary texts in reader-friendly format; a film\u000a      documentary; an internet blog;\u000a      public talks and debates in cultural centres and museums; activities at\u000a      Adult Education centres and\u000a      with reading groups. The ensuing lively (and at times heated) debates and\u000a      discussions have in turn\u000a      fed back into an evolving dialogue between researchers and the public. In\u000a      this case, impact, like\u000a      the research, is a continuous process, not a single event.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Birmingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Birmingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10006840}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2509954","Name":"Valencia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3110044","Name":"Donostia-San Sebastián"},{"GeoNamesId":"2972315","Name":"Toulouse"},{"GeoNamesId":"3128760","Name":"Barcelona"},{"GeoNamesId":"3110044","Name":"San Sebastian"},{"GeoNamesId":"3336901","Name":"Catalunya"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000aR1.

The core of the research, conducted by Dr M&#243;nica\u000a      Jato (Senior Lecturer at\u000a      the University of Birmingham) between 2006 and 2013, has concentrated on\u000a      two collections of\u000a      literary and biographical texts which remained unpublished for over 50\u000a      years as a result firstly of\u000a      Francoist censorship and then of the so-called `Pact of Forgetting' in the\u000a      1970s. The passing of the\u000a      `Law of Historical Memory' on 31st October 2007 served merely\u000a      to re-ignite rather than dampen\u000a      public anger about the Civil War and its consequences. Since then the\u000a      processes of debate and\u000a      national self-examination have become sharply focused on issues of\u000a      commemoration,\u000a      memorialisation and reconciliation, as Spaniards of different generations\u000a      confront the country's\u000a      deeply troubling history. These controversies and their historical origins\u000a      define the social and\u000a      political contexts with which Jato's research aims to engage.\u000a    The research has involved tracking down, assembling and editing (largely\u000a      from manuscripts)\u000a      documents of a suppressed past, and providing the detailed commentaries\u000a      necessary to explain\u000a      their historical context to today's readers. The research also entailed\u000a      holding interviews and\u000a      discussions with victims of the Spanish Civil War, with relatives of the\u000a      victims, with organisations\u000a      such as the International Brigades, `Basque Children of 37', and with\u000a      communities of Spanish\u000a      expatriates in the UK. The research has continued through the processes of\u000a      public engagement\u000a      and will feed into further planned publications [see source 6 below].\u000a    The two editions present the testimonies and cultural\/literary\u000a      representations of political and social\u000a      exile as experienced by two Republican women, namely Cecilia Garc&#237;a de\u000a      Guilarte, who went into\u000a      political exile in Mexico, and Mar&#237;a Beneyto, one of the `inner exiles'\u000a      who remained in Spain under\u000a      Franco's dictatorship. Guilarte's articles in Un barco cargado de...,\u000a      (R1 below) began to be\u000a      published in La voz de Espa&#241;a in 1972, but for political reasons\u000a      publication was ended after just 16\u000a      articles had appeared. Eight of the short stories included in Maria\u000a      Beneyto's Cuentos para d&#237;as de\u000a        lluvia (R2) likewise remained unpublished for more than 50 years (as\u000a      a result of self-censorship).\u000a    The editorial and analytic work on this material has thrown new light on\u000a      women's experiences of\u000a      war, the Francoist regime and the different types of exile to which it\u000a      condemned so many. Despite\u000a      the recent expansion of studies of memory, exile and the legacy of the\u000a      Civil War, the textual basis\u000a      of discussion has been limited to a number of `canonical' authors. The\u000a      edited testimonies of\u000a      Beneyto and Guilarte aim to extend the corpus of relevant material, so\u000a      that other, non-canonical\u000a      voices can be heard.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38887","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6254930","Name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Professor Speirs' translations of Weber and Nietzsche are having\u000a      sustained and demonstrable impact upon educators, students, the general\u000a      public, and on the publishing industry in the UK and abroad.

Speirs while Senior Lecturer at the\u000a      University of Birmingham in 1992-3 (Weber) and 1997-98 (Nietzsche)\u000a      respectively. Each edition was a joint, inter-disciplinary undertaking.\u000a      Speirs co-edited Nietzsche with the philosopher Raymond Geuss, University\u000a      of Cambridge. Speirs co-edited Weber with the political scientist Peter\u000a      Lassman, University of Birmingham. Translation and linguistic commentary\u000a      were entirely the work of Speirs.\u000a    The detailed work of translation was preceded by a period of extensive\u000a      and intensive reading and systematic analysis of the characteristic lexis\u000a      and syntax of each author, as evidenced both in the texts chosen for\u000a      translation and in the much larger body of writings produced by each of\u000a      these very prolific thinkers. The writings of each author had in turn to\u000a      be studied in and related to the context of the cultural and intellectual\u000a      communities in which they were framed, in order to reflect the discursive\u000a      usage to which Nietzsche and Weber made reference and in relation to which\u000a      they defined their own views of the topics they were writing about.\u000a    The aim was not to transfer the work of Nietzsche or Weber out of their\u000a      original German intellectual and cultural context and into an English one,\u000a      but rather the opposite: to build a bridge which would allow English\u000a      readers access to an intellectual and rhetorical culture that many would\u000a      find unfamiliar in significant respects. The translations therefore\u000a      knowingly sacrificed elegance for the sake of bringing the reader as close\u000a      to the source texts as possible. If this meant that the English reader\u000a      would have to concentrate hard to follow Weber's complex periods, for\u000a      example, so be it; Weber's original essays do not make easy reading in\u000a      German either.\u000a    For purposes of consistency, it was particularly important to examine\u000a      closely the meaning or range of meanings attached by each author to a\u000a      number of recurrent key terms in their arguments across a range of\u000a      contexts in order to establish whether they could be rendered by a single\u000a      term in English or whether different emphases in different situations\u000a      called for a variety of translational equivalents. Where no single\u000a      one-for-one (approximate) equivalence was available, key terms were marked\u000a      by an asterisk in the text, referring the reader to an explanatory\u000a      glossary.\u000a    This approach to translation was a particular desideratum for a new\u000a      translation of Weber's political writings, not only because some important\u000a      texts were being translated for the first time, but also because\u000a      English-speaking readers had access to Weber until that point mainly\u000a      through translations into American English made in the 1930s by Talcott\u000a      Parsons, where the terms used to render Weber were too often taken from\u000a      the specific kind of (functionalist) sociological discourse inhabited (and\u000a      largely shaped) by the translator. In addition to the research embedded in\u000a      the many linguistic decisions made when translating the texts, each\u000a      edition included numerous brief explanatory footnotes (historical or\u000a      conceptual).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39938","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3562981","Name":"Cuba"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Kapcia's unparalleled knowledge of Cuban politics makes him recognised as\u000a      `one of the top Cuba experts in the UK' (5.1). In addition to the examples\u000a      below, this knowledge has been drawn on in (i) 28 international media\u000a      interviews (since 2008), adding accuracy and insight to public\u000a      understanding of Cuba (5.2), and (ii) regular consultations by journalists\u000a      over a sustained period of time, consultations which have proved\u000a      `indispensable' to their understanding of the country and the region\u000a      (5.3).\u000a    The narrative below describes the influence of Kapcia's research on\u000a      policy-makers and intelligence units: the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\u000a      (FCO), the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the Center for Strategic and\u000a      International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., and The Cuba Initiative,\u000a      demonstrating the comprehensive reach of Kapcia's research and the\u000a      different ways in which it informs and influences policy and practice\u000a      nationally and internationally.\u000a    Informing and shaping UK and US government policy towards Cuba\u000a      Workshops and briefings presented by Kapcia have enriched the\u000a      knowledge-base of policy-makers in the UK and the US and have contributed\u000a      materially to how these two countries understand and make decisions about\u000a      their relationships with Cuba.\u000a    The Senior Principal Research Analyst of the Americas Research Group in\u000a      the FCO considers that Kapcia has provided significant assistance to the\u000a      FCO for many years as an external expert on Cuba. Discussions with FCO\u000a      officials and other external experts during his regular invitations to the\u000a      FCO in London are considered to be `important in the development of\u000a      government policy towards Cuba'. These meetings are often organised around\u000a      the briefing of senior staff being posted to Cuba: Kapcia has been a key\u000a      participant in the briefing of the last two Ambassadors who have been\u000a      posted there. The briefings have covered the future of Cuba after the\u000a      Castro brothers, the prospects for the economic reforms in Cuba, and the\u000a      relationships between Cuba and other countries, for which Kapcia has been\u000a      able to draw on research insights from the published outputs listed in\u000a      section 3. During these sessions, Kapcia's remit is always to focus on\u000a      explaining and making judgements on the current political situation in\u000a      Cuba and assessing possible future developments. This initial briefing has\u000a      always been followed up subsequently by the British Embassy in Havana,\u000a      which takes advantage of Kapcia's visits to Cuba to arrange meetings to\u000a      discuss current Cuban politics and to exchange ideas with the Ambassador,\u000a      and the First and Second Secretaries of the Embassy. In addition, on four\u000a      occasions, Kapcia has been invited by the FCO to participate in small\u000a      seminars run by the FCO's Americas Research Group, with the explicit\u000a      purpose of providing orientation for new FCO researchers on current Cuban\u000a      issues. The latest such invitation was in February 2013 (5.1).\u000a    Through his contribution to a panel on `Ra&#250;l in Power: What to Expect'\u000a      (October 2008) Kapcia fulfilled a similar advisory role for the Americas\u000a      Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in\u000a      Washington, D.C. The panel in which Kapcia participated was part of a\u000a      series of seven panel discussions between October 2008 and July 2009\u000a      examining a wide range of topics related to Cuba and U.S.-Cuba relations.\u000a      As CSIS's former Director explains, each panel discussion was attended by\u000a      `an invited audience of U.S. government officials, foreign diplomats,\u000a      academicians, representatives of international organizations,\u000a      Washington-based think tanks, civil society and the private sector and was\u000a      open to the public in general'. The director commented that `Prof.\u000a      Kapcia's presentation on Ra&#250;l Castro's relationship with the Cuban\u000a      Communist Party and the link between the Party and the Revolutionary Armed\u000a      Forces of Cuba was outstanding, providing an excellent perspective on the\u000a      role of those key institutions in Cuban governance looking forward. His\u000a      comments provided an excellent framework for discussion on the nature of\u000a      the exercise of power in Cuba and set the stage for subsequent panels to\u000a      follow.' The publication pursuant from the panels received `very wide\u000a      electronic distribution and was also available in hard-copy'. It was\u000a      primarily targeted at the policy community in Washington and abroad (5.4).\u000a    Providing intelligence on Cuba to business agencies, diplomatic\u000a        missions and journalists\u000a      Kapcia has provided political updates and analyses on Cuba to the\u000a      Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) (the research unit owned by the\u000a      Economist Group) which, through their use by academics (40%), financial\u000a      services (28%), government and NGOs (including diplomatic missions) (25%),\u000a      corporate sector organisations (5%) and professional services (1%), and\u000a      international journalists, have been a significant element in informing\u000a      external analyses of the country. \u000a    The EIU specialises in preparing focussed `country reports' on current\u000a      political and social developments in given countries. The reports contain\u000a      extensive analysis and forecasts of political, policy and economic\u000a      conditions to help clients understand the current situation and likely\u000a      future political and economic developments. Given the level of specialist\u000a      expertise, these reports are highly respected and valued for their depth\u000a      of analysis, the EIU reports on Cuba being frequently singled out by\u000a      members of the diplomatic community and journalists as especially\u000a      perceptive and well-informed, reaching into areas of the Cuban political\u000a      and economic scene which those observers are less able to cover (5.5). The\u000a      Regional Director for the EIU suggests that `the continually firm demand\u000a      for our Cuba products suggests that clients value the product, and in turn\u000a      the insights that our contributors provide' (5.6).\u000a    The Head of the Reuters Office in Havana sees the EIU's reports as the\u000a      means through which Kapcia has `always helped Reuters to understand the\u000a      country and events'. A reduction in the flow of economic information (both\u000a      through official channels and leaks) that has characterised President Ra&#250;l\u000a      Castro's term in office means that journalists increasingly rely for\u000a      information on two key public sources (of which the EIU is one), and in\u000a      many cases make decisions based on that information. He considers the\u000a      information provided by Kapcia through the EIU reports to be `currently\u000a      indispensable' (5.3).\u000a    The Cuba Initiative (CI) is part of the Caribbean Council. It fosters\u000a      trade, investment and deve-lopment in the Caribbean and promotes the\u000a      region's interests internationally (5.5). Kapcia's contributions to the CI\u000a      (through discussion groups and a broader advisory role) have provided `an\u000a      unbiased understanding of the Cuban political system', and have helped the\u000a      CI `in arriving at the considered advice we have to give to investors, the\u000a      private sector, government, the European Commission and others who are\u000a      involved in the day to day working relationship with Cuba and its\u000a      Government and enterprises'. Like the EIU, the CI particularly values\u000a      Kapcia's advice in the current context of Cuba where there is limited\u000a      access to senior figures in Government, officials and others. It sees\u000a      Kapcia as being able to provide alternative views or opinions `based on\u000a      well-founded and realistic research against which we can measure our own\u000a      opinions' giving Kapcia's work a `unique practical application in as much\u000a      as it also enables us at the Caribbean Council to better consider the\u000a      impact of new thinking in Cuba on the rest of the Caribbean' (5.5).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken by Professor Antoni Kapcia has had far-reaching\u000a      influences on policy formation (internationally) and has improved the\u000a      intelligence base on Cuba for journalists, business organisations and\u000a      diplomatic missions.

Its seminars and annual conferences\u000a      (involving the Cuba Research Forum, a network of national and\u000a      inter-national specialists), and its regular group discussions for Centre\u000a      participants, have all informed Kapcia's research, enabling it to draw on\u000a      inputs from postgraduates and postdoctoral researchers, and from\u000a      colleagues in Cuba, through joint seminars and collaborations.\u000a    The research underpinning the findings below has focussed on five areas:\u000a    \u000a      The main and most consistent strand has been the focus on the\u000a        evolution of Cuban revolutionary ideology (carried out between\u000a        1994-2000, resulting in reference 3.1) and of Cuban debates about, and\u000a        definitions of, national identity (carried out between 2000-2008,\u000a        resulting in references 3.2 &amp; 3.3);\u000a      The second focus, clearly emanating from the first, is on the\u000a        nation-building dimension of the transformations in Cuba after 1959,\u000a        with special and increasing attention being paid to the concept and role\u000a        of cultural nationalism and the nature and role of popular participation\u000a        (1998-present, resulting in references 3.3 &amp; 3.4);\u000a      A further consistent strand of Kapcia's research has been a focus on\u000a        the nature, mechanisms, structures and actors of the Cuban political\u000a        system (1992-present, resulting in reference 3.5 &amp; 3.9), and current\u000a        work (for Zed Press) on political leadership since 1959;\u000a      Following on from the previous three, a more recent focus has been on\u000a        the contradictory nature of post-2000 Cuban politics, especially the\u000a        so-called Batalla de Ideas (Battle of Ideas) strategy and the question\u000a        of political succession (2000-present, resulting in references 3.6, 3.7,\u000a        3.8, 3.9 &amp; 3.10);\u000a      Finally, as a result of the post-2005 Leverhulme Trust project, the\u000a        most recent focus has been on the evolution and role of the book and of\u000a        literature and literary culture within Cuban processes of political\u000a        transformation and nation-building from 1961 (2004-present, resulting in\u000a        reference 3.4).\u000a    \u000a    From those different, but closely related research strands, the main\u000a      insights and findings which have resulted have been:\u000a    i) That the post-1959 Cuban Revolution is best understood as a delayed\u000a      process of radical nationalist nation-building, and, within a wider\u000a      context, not so much as an example of 1945-89 Communism as of post-1947\u000a      decolonisation in the developing world, i.e. seeing post-1959 Cuba as a\u000a      special case of post-colonial nation-building; this is an interpretation\u000a      which, thanks to the dissemination of Kapcia's research, has become more\u000a      widely accepted among Cuba specialists;\u000a    ii) Therefore, that ideology in post-1959 Cuba should be seen not so much\u000a      as `Communism' (in its more conventionally understood forms) but rather as\u000a      a unique and evolving fusion of radicalism and nationalism, still\u000a      irrevocably shaping Cuban political culture;\u000a    iii) That the Cuban political system should be seen not as a case of a\u000a      monolithic state but rather as a more complex, multi-layered,\u000a      quasi-corporatist matrix, characterised by processes of constant\u000a      negotiation and structured participation;\u000a    iv) That political protagonism in that system should not be understood in\u000a      terms of individuals and the force of personality but rather in the\u000a      context of continual debates and negotiation within a leadership, more\u000a      collective than the conventional `Fidel-centric' focus would suppose;\u000a    v) That literacy, books, reading and literature as elements in policy and\u000a      as social activities have all been fundamental to the post-1961 processes\u000a      of political socialisation in Cuba.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39939","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"3474414","Name":"Falkland Islands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    McGuirk's insights into the ways that cultural production has articulated\u000a      ideas and challenged accepted (partisan) opinion about the\u000a      Falklands-Malvinas war created channels for enhanced understanding of the\u000a      self, conflict, military identity, sovereignty, nationalism and political\u000a      discourse. Specifically, it helped veterans begin a dialogue that would\u000a      lead to healing and reconciliation, and it helped to effect a broadening\u000a      in the political and cultural perspective underpinning Argentinian\u000a      diplomatic training and practice. It has also influenced the approach to\u000a      reporting of two prominent journalists.\u000a    Contributing to processes of reconciliation and healing for veterans\u000a        of the Falklands\/ Malvinas conflict\u000a    McGuirk's research has helped soldiers to overcome the battlefield trauma\u000a      they experienced during their involvement in the Falklands-Malvinas\u000a      conflict. By bringing together veterans from both sides in mediated\u000a      encounters under the auspices of the ICSPRR (beginning in 2006 and\u000a      continuing through to 2013), dialogue was initiated that has led to a\u000a      sustained process of healing (subsequently continued through a veteran-led\u000a      online support forum and on-going meetings of the ICSPRR's veteran forum\u000a      the Grupo Nottingham\/Malvinas) (5.1). Discussions at ICSPRR\u000a      encounters built on McGuirk's research insights into the literary and\u000a      cultural representation of issues such as the nature of military identity,\u000a      the physical and mental traumas of war, and the nature of the nation and\u000a      sovereignty (3.1, 3.2, 3.4).\u000a    Reflecting on the impact of the work and regular meetings of the ICSPRR\u000a      between 2006 and 2012, a veteran Commander (Capit&#225;n de Fragata) of the\u000a      Argentine Navy commented that `McGuirk's research has helped change\u000a        many a mind of adult soldiers [sic] and bring them to consider each\u000a        other from a more humanized perspective. Though this effect is\u000a      unwanted when at war, it is crucial to build a durable peace'. A\u000a      journalist (ex-editor of the Soldier magazine) observed a veteran\u000a      come face to face with his old adversaries: `There's a picture of them\u000a      eyeing each other up and it was all very tense, but by the end everything\u000a      had thawed and they were talking as friends.' A retired British Major and\u000a      veteran of the conflict commented that, after the sessions, soldiers\u000a        approached him to say how therapeutic it was and how it had helped them\u000a        get over events. The President of the Argentine War Veterans\u000a      Association observes that the bringing together of former enemies: `...\u000a      probably represents one of the most important events regarding the\u000a      Malvinas issue. Argentine military personnel and their British\u000a      counterparts met, saw each other's human dimension and found out what\u000a      really happened during the hand-to-hand bloody battles [...] To be\u000a        able to give a great hug to my erstwhile opposite number, with whom I\u000a        had previously only had written contact, was a most rewarding and\u000a        uplifting experience.' One Argentine veteran describes the act of\u000a      bringing together ex-combatants to exchange experiences and points of\u000a      views as `revolutionary', and another says that `it helped me obtain a\u000a        broader view of the Malvinas-Falklands conflict and reconcile some\u000a        issues I struggled with. More generally, Professor McGuirk's\u000a      research has helped me consider the Malvinas-Falklands conflict as a\u000a      possible spring-board for a better relation between Britain and Argentina\u000a      and has engaged my interest into areas that I would probably never have\u000a      considered' (5.2). ICSPRR meetings are also attended by journa-lists,\u000a      academics, and doctors specialising in PTSD. A Norwegian Psychiatrist and\u000a      Professor in traumatic stress (a world authority on the\u000a      psycho-traumatology and psychological support aspects of war) observed\u000a      after one meeting in 2012 that the veterans `obviously profited' from\u000a        the encounters (5.3).\u000a    The statements above illustrate how the work of the ICSPRR has contributed\u000a        decisively to processes of reconciliation, effectively filling the\u000a      gap left by the absence of official support mechanisms and infrastructure\u000a      for Falklands-Malvinas veterans in both the UK and Argentina. It has\u000a      provided a sympathetic environment, enabling dialogue between\u000a        ex-soldiers from both sides. The statements included above from key\u000a      military personnel involved in the conflict attest to the degree to which\u000a      the encounters helped them to reflect on and discuss their personal\u000a        experiences of the trauma of war in a way that moved them towards\u000a        personal reconciliation. A retired British Major comments that `I\u000a      don't think you can put a price on the reconciliation of veterans. War\u000a      isn't an impersonal thing to do, wounds run very deep and hatred runs very\u000a      deep, so to get people around the table and to get them engaging is\u000a        something extraordinary' (5.2).\u000a    The impact which McGuirk's research has had directly through the ICSPRR\u000a      has been amplified through the (subsequent) independent collaboration of\u000a      the veterans from both sides in the Grupo Nottingham\/Malvinas.\u000a      Its regular meetings between veterans in the years since 2006 (on-going\u000a        after 2008) have led to significant amelioration of trauma and mental\u000a        problems. Its online social media presence constitutes a sustainable\u000a      source of support for veterans and their families (5.4).\u000a    Influencing the understanding and perspectives of the Argentine\u000a        Ambassador\u000a    Complementing the work with veterans described above, McGuirk has\u000a      collaborated with H.E. the Ambassador of the Republic of Argentina to the\u000a      Court of St James, and with the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs. For\u000a      this collaboration, McGuirk focused on the areas of his research which\u000a      alerted the Ambassador to post-82 debates and took her beyond the limited\u000a      political agendas of both nations. He was able to bring to her attention\u000a      writers' and cartoonists' views of the conflict which challenged popular\u000a      and nationalistic positions and with which she was not familiar. That\u000a      approach was aimed at broadening perspectives and shifting perceptions\u000a      about political discourse in both countries. This research with its\u000a      balanced, non-partisan insights into the nature of the 1982 war (and its\u000a      political, cultural and psychological effects) has been warmly appreciated\u000a      by the Embassy and has influenced the Ambassador's approach to her\u000a        role in the UK: McGuirk was invited to brief her in the approach to\u000a      the thirtieth anniversary of the conflict in 2012 on both British and\u000a      international perspectives. Subsequently, in May 2012, the Ambassador\u000a      attended a colloquium in Nottingham on Anglo-Argentine relations\u000a      1982-2012, at which she met Argentine and British veterans of the conflict\u000a      and Falkland Islanders. That visit was followed by five reciprocal\u000a      invitations to McGuirk (2012-2013) to address Argentine and Latin American\u000a      diplomats and historians at the Argentine Embassy in London. Her repeated\u000a      requests for briefings and her recommendation of McGuirk for a training\u000a      role with future Argentine diplomats indicates the degree to which she\u000a      values his understanding of the issues and the constructive potential in a\u000a      broad approach which goes beyond narrow political and ideological\u000a      interests.\u000a    The Ambassador was instrumental in the issuing of an invitation to\u000a      McGuirk to lead a course for the Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs'\u000a      National Institute of the Foreign Service to instruct trainee diplomats on\u000a      UK foreign policy and Anglo-Argentine reconciliation and post-conflict\u000a      reconstruction (Buenos Aires, April 2013). Based on the success of this\u000a      initial encounter (5.5), he has been invited to return to lead another\u000a      such course, in collaboration with a fellow member of the ICSPRR (also\u000a      Chief Executive of Juniper Productions, former Director of political\u000a      programming at BBC TV, Member of the BBC Board of Governors): `Further to\u000a      the success of Professor McGuirk's acceptance of the Ambassador's proposal\u000a      that he visit and instruct the trainee diplomats at ISEN, at the\u000a      Chancellery in Buenos Aires, in Spring 2013, I am aware that another such\u000a      visit involving myself and Professor McGuirk is being considered by the\u000a      Embassy as an appropriate extension of the impact made by our respective\u000a      dealings with the Embassy since 2012.' He adds that in his capacity as a\u000a      producer and director of television programmes and as a media specialist\u000a      whom McGuirk had introduced to the Ambassador, `I regularly consult with\u000a      [the Ambassador] and her fellow diplomats on these matters. This on-going\u000a        involvement in a high-impact area in current Anglo-Argentine relations\u000a        stems in the first instance from the Embassy's awareness of McGuirk's\u000a        published research and up-to-the minute expertise in such matters\u000a      since the 1982 Falklands-Malvinas conflict and its reliance on his network\u000a      of specialist advisors in academe and the media' (5.6).\u000a    Providing new perspectives for broadcasters and journalists on war\u000a    Complementing this work with veterans and the Argentine Embassy,\u000a      McGuirk's research also influenced the approach of broadcasters and\u000a      journalists producing work on the Falklands-Malvinas conflict,\u000a      contributing to expanded perspectives for viewers and readers. With a\u000a      worldwide readership and a monthly circulation in excess of 250,000, Soldier\u000a      is the official magazine of the British Army and was voted best internal\u000a      news magazine in Britain in 2008, 2009 &amp; 2010 (5.7). Read extensively\u000a      by all ranks, the magazine has an annual feature on the conflict. The\u000a      former editor of the publication has significant experience in reporting\u000a      defence and security issues, including working in operational theatres and\u000a      troubled areas of the world. He says of the ICSPRR group: `It's changed\u000a        how I report, yes. It's given me an insight into the complexities of\u000a        things, especially for something like the Falklands-Malvinas, with the\u000a        huge resonance that it has' (5.8). Shah concurs: `Professor\u000a      McGuirk's research has been of great value in informing programming\u000a        ideas and proposals for documentary production. His examination of\u000a      the Falklands-Malvinas conflict in terms of representation in the media,\u000a      in literature and other forms of expression has contributed to our own\u000a        coverage of the story in political programmes made by Juniper and in\u000a      documentary proposals put to the BBC and Channel 4' (5.6).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Work with veterans, diplomats, trauma specialists and journalists under\u000a      the auspices of the International Consortium for the Study of\u000a      Post-Conflict Reconciliation and Reconstruction (ICSPRR) has allowed\u000a      Professor Bernard McGuirk's research to contribute to processes of\u000a      reconstruction and reconciliation between Argentina and the UK.

It has a Managing Board including international\u000a      experts on human rights law, diplomacy and international relations,\u000a      military history, trauma psychiatry and the media. There is an associated\u000a      imprint, Critical, Cultural and Communications Press, under the editorship\u000a      of McGuirk and McDonald Daly, which publishes the series Studies in\u000a        Post-Conflict Cultures. Its seminars and annual conferences have all\u000a      informed and been informed by McGuirk's research, enabling it to draw on\u000a      specialist inputs from researchers internationally through\u000a      jointly-organized events and institutional and individual collaborations.\u000a    The research began as a response to the then forthcoming twenty-fifth\u000a      anniversary in 2007 of the Falklands-Malvinas conflict in the South\u000a      Atlantic. In particular, McGuirk began by exploring the growing number of\u000a      Argentine publications which centred on ways of conceptualising defeat and\u000a      victory, and on the dangers of abjection and triumphalism. His research\u000a      into poetry, novels, plays and military memoirs focused on political,\u000a      cultural and personal questions connected with conflict and developed to\u000a      embrace more popular forms such as songs and television programmes. In\u000a      identifying equivalent cultural expressions in English he found that there\u000a      was a significant overlap in the area of military memoirs.\u000a    The underpinning research of this case study has concentrated on three\u000a      strands:\u000a    i) The principal strand has focused on the political and cultural impact\u000a      of the 1982 conflict in the South Atlantic. Primarily, McGuirk has\u000a      examined literary and cinematographic representations of the war over\u000a      twenty-five years. The materials analysed include a wide range of work\u000a      from the UK, Argentina and elsewhere, including theatrical performance,\u000a      veterans' memoirs, TV soap operas, popular fiction and music, children's\u000a      literature, protest song and accounts of trauma psychiatry. Some of the\u000a      principal issues examined include the interface between propaganda and\u000a      literary and cultural expression, the transmutation of historical events\u000a      into public mythologies and the formation of national(istic) imaginaries.\u000a      In analysing the different cultural texts about the war and its aftermath\u000a      McGuirk has also explored questions of individual identity, trauma,\u000a      perceptions of the nation and the experience of war (3.1).\u000a    ii) The second strand, arising directly from the first, has examined a\u000a      variety of responses to the experience of war and has challenged the ways\u000a      in which different political and military protagonists have sought to make\u000a      sense of the conflict and its consequences (3.2).\u000a    iii) The third strand has centred on the role of the political cartoon in\u000a      conflict and post-conflict cultures. Working with cartoons from the UK,\u000a      Argentina and elsewhere, McGuirk has explored the generic qualities of the\u000a      cartoon and its capacity for political intervention, the nature of the\u000a      critical perspectives presented and the capacity of the cartoonist to say\u000a      what others might not dare to (3.3, 3.4 and 3.5).\u000a    From these distinct but closely related research strands, the main\u000a      insights and findings have been:\u000a    \u000a      That the strained relations between the UK and Argentina from 1982 to\u000a        the present can be productively reassessed by analysing the damaging\u000a        cultural mythologies constructed around key polarisations such as:\u000a        winner\/loser, end of dictatorship\/entrenchment of Thatcherism,\u000a        territorial sovereignty\/community self-determination;\u000a      That the UK and Argentina need to pay closer attention to the\u000a        continuing plight of veterans and PTSD sufferers, not least because of\u000a        the high number of suicides of ex-combatants on both sides;\u000a      That, while there has been some public debate about the on-going\u000a        resonance of the conflict, it is cultural and artistic work which has\u000a        underlined the need to deal with veterans' trauma and suffering;\u000a      That a key effect of reflection on the conflict is to reassess the\u000a        relationship between politicians and the military, and consequently to\u000a        question the relationship between sovereignty and the interests of the\u000a        nation;\u000a      That the political cartoon provides a relatively under-analysed\u000a        vehicle for critique of the manipulated political and cultural\u000a        assumptions that have underpinned politicians' discourse in the UK and\u000a        Argentina in the years since the end of the conflict in the South\u000a        Atlantic.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39940","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This early-stage impact narrative describes the effect of Yuan's research\u000d\u000a      on changes in practice amongst key figures within large global mediation\u000d\u000a      organisations (representing many thousands of practitioners).

It\u000d\u000a      allowed them to develop new networks and to challenge some assumptions\u000d\u000a        underpinning their own practice. They felt that cultural aspects of\u000d\u000a      mediation had previously been under-researched and often overlooked\u000d\u000a      professionally, and that there was much to be gained in terms of improving\u000d\u000a      their practice by this bringing together of practitioners (mediators and\u000d\u000a      transla- tors) with theorists (academics): `Many of the issues neglected\u000d\u000a      so far have now been put on the table. Many other conferences look at the\u000d\u000a      same sort of things but the interdisciplinarity is missing most of the\u000d\u000a      time'; `Serious academic research...

The Centre was launched in 1990\u000d\u000a        with the support of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and\u000d\u000a        leading law firms, business and public sector organisations. It is the\u000d\u000a        largest independent alternative dispute resolution body in Europe, has\u000d\u000a        access to over 5000 mediators and neutrals worldwide. CEDR\u000a          Skills offers high-level expertise in consultancy, mediation\u000d\u000a        training, and coaching, including the leading,\u000d\u000a        internationally-recognised Mediator\u000a          Skills Training programme. A legal adviser at the CBI and a senior\u000d\u000a        mediator at CEDR says that the exchanges with academics facilitated\u000d\u000a        through Yuan's network have improved his understan- ding of Chinese\u000d\u000a          cultural characteristics that can affect Chinese people's negotiation\u000d\u000a          behaviour, and have changed how he approaches negotiation in his\u000d\u000a          professional practice: `From the academics' work, I can appreciate\u000d\u000a        for example that when a Chinese person says 'yes', it does not\u000d\u000a        necessarily mean that he or she is agreeing with the other party. It\u000d\u000a        could merely be a filler, like 'well' in English, used to communicate\u000d\u000a        their understanding of what the other says. Now when I mediate with\u000d\u000a        Chinese parties, I try to explore with them whether they genuinely agree\u000d\u000a        or just intend to elicit more information when they say 'yes'. Moreover,\u000d\u000a        In China, the person who attends the mediation does not always possess\u000d\u000a        the necessary authority to settle, which can be different from his or\u000d\u000a        her European counterpart. Now I try to explain to the other party that\u000d\u000a        this cultural difference may change the pace of mediation to help them\u000d\u000a        adjust their expectations' (5.4). He also commented on the `costly and\u000d\u000a        difficult' process of trying to resolve cross-border commercial disputes\u000d\u000a        through a court process, and the increasing reliance on mediation as a\u000d\u000a        way of mitigating this. As such, the commercial impact of\u000d\u000a          improvements to mediation in cross- border disputes is very\u000d\u000a          considerable (5.4).\u000d\u000a      The International Mediation Institute (IMI) is the only\u000d\u000a        organization in the world to transcend local jurisdictions and to\u000d\u000a        develop global, professional standards for experienced mediators,\u000d\u000a        advocates and others involved in collaborative dispute resolution and\u000d\u000a        negotiation processes (5.5). Through her presentation of the key\u000d\u000a        findings at the IMI's workshop on intercultural mediation (7- 8\/07\/12),\u000d\u000a        and at CEDR's mediation skills training courses in London (5-11\/12\/12),\u000d\u000a        Yuan provoked fruitful discussions amongst other participants who found\u000d\u000a        the research findings `enlightening', `stimulating' and `empowering'.\u000d\u000a        The research led them to rethink their approach to the intercultural\u000d\u000a        aspects of mediation and the use of interpretation in mediation.\u000d\u000a        Mediators reported that `the research had provided them with a\u000d\u000a          powerful tool to understand the cultural challenges in international\u000d\u000a          mediation, and helped them reconsider how to handle the\u000d\u000a          challenges with informed intellectual knowledge and skills'\u000d\u000a        instead of from an instinctive basis. The Director of the Netherlands\u000d\u000a        Mediation Institute (NMI) expressed his determination to `take what he\u000d\u000a        had learnt from the researchers back to Holland and further stimulate\u000d\u000a        discussion and collaboration there' (5.2).\u000d\u000a      The Union Internationale des Avocats (UIA) (5.6) is the oldest\u000d\u000a        global association of lawyers in the world, formed in 1927. Most bar\u000d\u000a        associations and solicitor organisations around the world are members.\u000d\u000a        The UIA has various commissions, including the Mediation and Conflict\u000d\u000a        Prevention Commission. In 2001 the World Forum of Mediation Centres was\u000d\u000a        formed as a sub-commission of the Mediation and Conflict Prevention\u000d\u000a        Commission.

The President of UIA Mediation\u000d\u000a        Centres says that Yuan's work `informed the practitioners of the major\u000d\u000a        social roles and powers that an interpreter possesses in conflict\u000d\u000a        management, challenging mediators' preconceptions of interpreters as\u000d\u000a        mere language conduits. This served to influence their practice and\u000d\u000a          helped them to improve and achieve successful co-working with\u000d\u000a          interpreters for the benefit of not just mediators but also\u000d\u000a        parties in disputes' (5.7).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    A series of cross-sectoral workshops brought together for the first time\u000d\u000a      professional mediators and translators with academics to share knowledge\u000d\u000a      and experience of the cultural aspects of mediation.

In addition, it analyses the influence of cultural variables on\u000d\u000a      people's interactional behaviour. It was developed with a view to\u000d\u000a      investigating how politeness\/face phenomena, which embody interpersonal\u000d\u000a      relationship management behaviour, are characterised in Chinese and\u000d\u000a      English films respectively and how they are represented in audio-visual\u000d\u000a      translation (AVT). A key aspect of the research was to gauge the effect of\u000d\u000a      translation on viewers' interpreta- tion of interpersonal dynamics\u000d\u000a      presented on screen. That effect was examined via audience res- ponse\u000d\u000a      experiments. The research carried out at Nottingham after 2010 built on\u000d\u000a      Yuan's doctoral work and, in the preparation of her book in which this\u000d\u000a      area culminated (3.1), significantly streng- thened the theoretical\u000d\u000a      framework. In particular, two of the book's core aspects &#8212; her composite\u000d\u000a      model of Face Management and her analysis of politeness in the Far East -\u000d\u000a      were substantially developed in Nottingham and inform the whole book.\u000d\u000a    The second major area has been research on translating cultures in\u000d\u000a      international mediation. In this area, Yuan has been leading an\u000d\u000a      AHRC-funded interdisciplinary research network investigating how to manage\u000d\u000a      translation and cultural challenges in international mediation (3.2). The\u000d\u000a      network is composed of scholars in translation, communication, business\u000d\u000a      studies and intercultural studies, and professional mediators and\u000d\u000a      interpreters.\u000d\u000a    The third area of research, emanating from the first, has been a project\u000d\u000a      on face management in literary texts and readers' response to its\u000d\u000a      representation in translation (presented in a forthcoming publication: X.\u000d\u000a      Yuan, `Face Management in Literary Translation', in New Voices in\u000d\u000a        Translation Studies). In this research, interdisciplinarity is\u000d\u000a      reflected not only in bridging intercultural studies and translation\u000d\u000a      studies, but also in applying research methods drawn from psychology to\u000d\u000a      trans- lation studies via the use of reader response experiments.\u000d\u000a    The fourth and most recent research area has been a project on the\u000d\u000a      interpreter's role in political communication and focuses specifically on\u000d\u000a      how face management is manipulated by interpreters in the context of press\u000d\u000a      conferences to enable them to align themselves with the institutional\u000d\u000a      employer and to achieve professional effectiveness.\u000d\u000a    The key research insights produced by the four areas of research\u000d\u000a      highlight the following points:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The importance of effectively representing face features in subtitling\u000d\u000a        to enable audiences' full comprehension;\u000d\u000a      The importance of educating mediators in the cultural impact of\u000d\u000a        language use in conflict management;\u000d\u000a      The importance of educating mediators and interpreters in their\u000d\u000a        overlapping functions in coordinating interactions;\u000d\u000a      The importance of educating interpreters in the use of face management\u000d\u000a        strategies for professional effectiveness.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39941","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3625428","Name":"Venezuela"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A database of narratives of women who participated in the Latin American\u000d\u000a      Wars of Independence (3.1) underpinned three strands of international\u000d\u000a      public engagement activity which have effected changes in public awareness\u000d\u000a      (transnationally), contributed to community cohesion (locally) and\u000d\u000a      inspired pride and reflection for young migrant women.\u000d\u000a    Davies presented the Libertadoras project and its database (3.1)\u000d\u000a      to the directors of the Latin American Women's Rights Service (LAWRS) in\u000d\u000a      London, the Women's Museum in Buenos Aires, the New Art Exchange (NAE),\u000d\u000a      Nottingham, and Southwark Council along with key research findings\u000d\u000a      (3.1-3.5). The programmes which were subsequently developed with these\u000d\u000a      partners drew directly on these outputs and followed the theme of women's\u000d\u000a      historical struggle for independence in Latin America and the impact of\u000d\u000a      gendered political discourse. They engaged specifically with the critique\u000d\u000a      of androcentric historiography and political discourse (3.2 &amp; 3.3),\u000d\u000a      and the recovered names and stories of women who participated in the Wars\u000d\u000a      of Independence, translating the research insights and findings into\u000d\u000a      cultural and community events to highlight the continued relevance of the\u000d\u000a      Libertadoras to a contemporary audience (3.2-3.5).\u000d\u000a    Sharing recovered histories to create new knowledge and raise\u000d\u000a        awareness\u000d\u000a    A range of cultural activities developed in collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      Women's Museum in Buenos Aires and based on Davies' research included\u000d\u000a      readings and workshops using primary historical sources, round-table\u000d\u000a      discussions, an exhibition of historical and contemporary art, theatre\u000d\u000a      productions and a community translation programme in which volunteers\u000d\u000a      translated the biographies of the women in the database from English into\u000d\u000a      Spanish. The programme attracted 300 visitors from Buenos Aires, and from\u000d\u000a      Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Colombia, giving people new knowledge\u000d\u000a        about and new perspectives on their history, challenging\u000d\u000a      androcentric narratives of the Wars of Independence. Participant feedback\u000d\u000a      (which demonstrates a palpable sense of excitement) includes the following\u000d\u000a      comments: `I am sure there are important women from the independence\u000d\u000a      struggles [in my region]. I am going to find them!'; `[The material] helps\u000a        us to recognise difficulties from the past that are also present in the\u000d\u000a        current day'; `I intend to carry out readings with the women at the\u000d\u000a      public library where I participate in events', and `I certainly learned a\u000d\u000a      lot and I was reminded of things I had studied at university. I learnt\u000d\u000a        to value the work of women that exists \"behind\" grand events. For\u000d\u000a      example during war. Women are essential!' (5.1).\u000d\u000a    The programme of events, Libertadoras 19th C to 20th\u000d\u000a        C: A Century of Struggle, 15th August to 22nd September\u000d\u000a      2012, generated widespread national media coverage in Argentina, extending\u000d\u000a      the reach of the research into a wider public domain. Radio stations that\u000d\u000a      covered the events included Rock Nacional, Universidad de Buenos Airies,\u000d\u000a      Radio Gr&#225;fica and several shows specifically targeted at women including Monday\u000a        Again and Mothers' Voice. The National News Agency of\u000d\u000a      Argentina, national newspaper El Comercial, and Yahoo Mexico's\u000d\u000a      news page also all covered the exhibition (5.1). The Museum Director\u000d\u000a      reflected on how Davies' research (3.1-3.6), which had been embedded in\u000d\u000a      the activity, had stimulated discussion, particularly around\u000d\u000a        Independence, and the relationship between `national' and `personal'\u000d\u000a        independence. The participants were `keen to express opinions and to\u000d\u000a      deconstruct official points of view influenced by liberal, misogynist\u000d\u000a      history that hides the participation of women in historical crises' (5.2).\u000d\u000a    Increasing confidence and self-esteem within a community of young,\u000d\u000a        first-generation Latin American women in London\u000d\u000a    Young Latin American migrant women in London engaged with a programme of\u000d\u000a      cultural workshops (with outputs including exhibitions and theatre\u000d\u000a      performances) that had profound personal impacts on them. The\u000d\u000a      Director of LAWRS commented that `using the vehicle of Las Libertadoras\u000d\u000a      to explore issues of identify and belonging, and cultural pride, has had a\u000d\u000a      notable impact on these young women's sense of self and their social\u000d\u000a      engagement more broadly. The project has rescued the value and courage of\u000d\u000a      the libertadoras to inspire [...] all of us so that we can follow\u000d\u000a      their example' (5.3). The LAWRS Development and Outreach Officer said: `It\u000d\u000a      was clear the young women had been inspired by the libertadoras\u000d\u000a      and that they identified with them. This can be seen clearly in the photos\u000d\u000a      too' (5.4).\u000d\u000a    The impact of the performance and the exhibitions that were the outcome\u000d\u000a      of the LAWRS activity extended beyond the individual women involved, to\u000d\u000a      the audiences who engaged with the work through its performance\/display,\u000d\u000a      providing new awareness of the nature and experiences of the immigrant\u000d\u000a        Latin American community in London. The play, written and produced\u000d\u000a      by the young women (with the support of a drama teacher and LAWRS youth\u000d\u000a      workers), was entitled `Razones por las que luchar' (Reasons for\u000d\u000a      Fighting). It was based on re-enactments of the lives of individual Libertadoras\u000d\u000a      that the women had selected from the database (3.1). The play was\u000d\u000a      performed at the LAWRS AGM (November 2012) with an attendance of c. 150\u000d\u000a      women from the Latin American community and at the Institute of the\u000d\u000a      Americas, UCL (May 2013) to an audience of c. 50 including parents and\u000d\u000a      friends. Attendees' feedback focussed on the link between the histories\u000d\u000a      presented and contemporary politics and culture: `...the performance was\u000d\u000a      important for young Latin Americans who were born in the UK to remember\u000d\u000a      their roots. [These projects are] an awakening for our Latin American\u000d\u000a      community, for us to improve our conditions and have a better future';\u000d\u000a      `[...] it is good to get back in touch with history in order to\u000d\u000a        understand and change the political processes of the present' (5.5).\u000d\u000a    4,040 attended the exhibition Empowerment through Art: Photography\u000d\u000a        and Latin American Girls, at the NAE in March\/April 2013 and at\u000d\u000a      Southwark Council premises in May\/June 2013 (curated by British-Mexican\u000d\u000a      photographer Pablo Allison in collaboration with Roxana Allison). The\u000d\u000a      exhibition featured 11 portraits of the girls and their own photographs on\u000d\u000a      the theme of women's independence. The girls were photographed in the pose\u000d\u000a      of `heroines' having seen the images of `hero&#237;nas' in the image bank.\u000d\u000a      Visitor feedback attested to the effect of the work in raising awareness\u000d\u000a      about Latin American culture in general, and about gender identity within\u000d\u000a      the Latin American community more specifically: `The exhibition provoked\u000a        me to reflect on gender and ethnic identities'; `I learned about new\u000d\u000a      depths and richness in terms of Latin culture, history and identity'; `I\u000d\u000a      had no idea there were so many Latin Americans in the UK and that the\u000d\u000a      girls need support.' Visitors who spoke to the young women `got a real\u000d\u000a      sense that the project had raised the awareness, but also expectations, of\u000d\u000a      the young women involved' (5.6). A Southwark Councillor and cabinet member\u000d\u000a      for communities and economic wellbeing said: `We are thrilled to have\u000d\u000a      supported such an imaginative and inspiring project. I hope visitors of\u000d\u000a      all backgrounds will be encouraged by the stories and go on to fulfil\u000d\u000a      their own potential in a way that positively impacts upon the local\u000d\u000a      community' (5.7). The NAE curator reported that `audience feedback was\u000d\u000a      positive and the idea of how art can be a tool for empowerment especially\u000d\u000a      for recent immigrants was appreciated by all those who saw the exhibition'\u000d\u000a      (5.8).\u000d\u000a    Contributing to community cohesion in Southwark: the cultural and\u000d\u000a        language exchange\u000d\u000a    Southwark Council identified a need to improve communication with Latin\u000d\u000a      American migrants to their community, and invited Thomas (a Post-doctoral\u000d\u000a      researcher working with Davies on the project) to run a series of\u000d\u000a      workshops for its employees. The aim was to help them better understand\u000d\u000a      the cultural, linguistic and social profile of its Latin American\u000d\u000a      community. As part of these workshops, participants were introduced to the\u000d\u000a      image bank and database (3.1). Feedback from council employees\u000d\u000a      demonstrates the wide-ranging influence of the talks, which they praised\u000d\u000a      for increasing knowledge and understanding, helping the teams to build\u000d\u000a      networks with the Latin American community and identify contacts within\u000d\u000a      it. A council employee commented: `The sessions have definitely helped\u000d\u000a        with my job as I now have contacts with South American organisations\u000d\u000a      that I can refer some of our private tenants to [...]. The sessions have helped\u000a        my team to build networks with the South American community in Southwark'.\u000a      A Development Manager for the Safeguarding Children Board said `The\u000d\u000a      photographic presentation and meeting [with the Director of] LAWRs [...]\u000d\u000a      really gave me insight into Spanish and Latin American culture. It\u000d\u000a      also gave me a good connection with the LA community which I know I will\u000d\u000a      be returning to in my professional life.'

In the period leading up to 2010\u000d\u000a      and subsequently there was increased public interest in women's role in\u000d\u000a      the Wars of Independence generated by the celebrations of the\u000d\u000a      Bicentenaries of Independence and by women's unprecedented contemporary\u000d\u000a      prominence in Latin American politics since there were at the time women\u000d\u000a      Presidents in Brazil, Costa Rica, Argentina and Chile. The research,\u000d\u000a      funded by the AHRB\/AHRC 2001-2006, 2012-13 and by the University of\u000d\u000a      Nottingham, made a seminal contribution to revisionist accounts of\u000d\u000a      Independence. The project's website (3.1) is the first consolidated and\u000d\u000a      comprehensive resource making publicly available information about women's\u000d\u000a      participation in the Wars of Independence.\u000d\u000a    The three core strands in the project were: a) the study of women's\u000d\u000a      political culture; b) the discovery and evaluation of women's activities\u000d\u000a      and writings between 1810 and 1850; and c) the analysis of the textual\u000d\u000a      construction of gender in political discourse. In particular, the research\u000d\u000a      addressed four key research questions: (i) how the category `woman' was\u000d\u000a      produced discursively and politically in Spanish America at the time; (ii)\u000d\u000a      in what ways women were constructed ambi-guously as subjects and objects\u000d\u000a      in political discourse; (iii) what women's responses were to the\u000d\u000a      republican discourse of individual rights that equated individuality with\u000d\u000a      masculinity; and (iv) why, after Independence, political rights were still\u000d\u000a      denied to over half the population according to the criterion of sexual\u000d\u000a      difference.\u000d\u000a    The key findings and insights were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      that women had a hitherto unacknowledged and significant role in\u000d\u000a        Spanish American culture and history between 1810 and 1850 (3.1 to 3.4);\u000d\u000a      that there were shifts in gender parameters and discourse about gender\u000d\u000a        throughout the period in which the wars were fought but that\u000d\u000a        subsequently there was a return to earlier positions, which have\u000d\u000a        persisted until recently (3.1 to 3.4);\u000d\u000a      that aggressive and violent masculinity in militarized,\u000d\u000a        post-Independence societies had a profound cultural impact and shaped\u000d\u000a        the social norms deemed appropriate for women (3.2);\u000d\u000a      that the textual and visual representation of women as mythical\u000d\u000a        figures and literary tropes (e.g., liberty, `patria') rather than real,\u000d\u000a        historical figures rendered their exclusion from the public sphere\u000d\u000a        natural and acceptable (3.2, 3.4);\u000d\u000a      that patriarchal nationalist agendas were a driving force in\u000d\u000a        male-centred historiography (3.1, 3.2, 3.3);\u000d\u000a      that there was a significant number of hitherto unstudied writings by\u000d\u000a        women, including letters and educational texts (3.1-3.5) which revealed\u000d\u000a        forgotten aspects of women's contribution to the Independence struggles.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In addition to the research outputs, there were two research meetings\u000d\u000a      which helped to develop the scope of the research: an international\u000d\u000a      conference co-organized with Anthony Macfarlane (War-wick), `Unequal\u000d\u000a      States: Gender and Race at Latin America Independence', funded by the\u000d\u000a      universities of Warwick and Nottingham, 2004; and an international\u000d\u000a      symposium, `Women in Latin American Independence: History, Society,\u000d\u000a      Culture', at the Institute for the Study of the Americas, London, 2012,\u000d\u000a      funded by JISLAC in collaboration with Sara Beatriz Guardia, Director of\u000d\u000a      the Centro de Estudios la Mujer en la Historia de Am&#233;rica Latina\u000d\u000a      (Universidad de San Mart&#237;n de Porres, Lima).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39942","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    4.1 The pathway to impact\u000d\u000a    4.1.1 Bamforth's research on the manuscript and printed editions of\u000d\u000a      Boaistuau's Histoires prodigieuses [3.1; 3.2], and his status as a\u000d\u000a      scholar of marvels in 16th-century Europe [3.3], led to an invitation to\u000d\u000a      collaborate in a major French exhibition, A New World-The Birth of\u000d\u000a        Modern Lorraine, which took place 4 May-4 August 2013 at the Mus&#233;e\u000d\u000a      Lorrain, Nancy [5.1]. The exhibition was part of `Renaissance Nancy 2013',\u000d\u000a      a programme of activities designed to celebrate and recreate the\u000d\u000a      `Renaissance effect': to bring alive the rich past of Lorraine, to promote\u000d\u000a      pride in its Renaissance heritage and, by building on Renaissance themes\u000d\u000a      of curiosity, wonder and discovery, to inspire the inhabitants of Lorraine\u000d\u000a      to look at their region, which has lost its industrial base, in new,\u000d\u000a      positive ways. Having `greatly admired' Bamforth's edition of Boaistuau\u000d\u000a      [3.2], the curator asked him to contribute his research findings to\u000d\u000a      further the exhibition's aim of shedding new light on a curiosity rooted\u000d\u000a      in traditions and superstitions local to Lorraine [2.6]. The 16th-century\u000d\u000a      experience of marvel was recreated for the visitor through visual impact\u000d\u000a      [2.5], through the juxtaposition of bizarre everyday objects with wondrous\u000d\u000a      objects from the world of scientific enquiry [2.3], and through the\u000d\u000a      prominence of books and book illustration [2.5].\u000d\u000a    4.1.2 Bamforth, one of just two UK members of a large team of curators\u000d\u000a      and scholars, wrote a 5,000-word illustrated essay (one of a total of 14)\u000d\u000a      for the 400-page exhibition catalogue Un nouveau monde. Naissance de\u000d\u000a        la Lorraine moderne (Mus&#233;e Lorrain\/&#201;ditions Somogy, 2013) [5.3].\u000d\u000a      Bamforth's essay, `Marvels and the marvellous in the sixteenth century'\u000d\u000a      (pp. 156-67) articulates in an accessible manner not just how central the\u000d\u000a      concept of marvel is to the process of inquiry in the Renaissance [2.1],\u000d\u000a      but how marvel is woven visually into the experience of the everyday [2.2;\u000d\u000a      2.5]. He also curated seven exhibits for a room devoted to `Prodigies,\u000d\u000a      presages and signs: the supernatural' (cats. 110-16, printed catalogue pp.\u000d\u000a      280-83 [5.3]). They were chosen to exemplify the centrality of marvel as a\u000d\u000a      feature of the cultural landscape of 16th-century Lorraine, both as object\u000d\u000a      (in terms of cultural heritage) and wondrous response (a way of\u000d\u000a      experiencing and interrogating the immediate world) [2.4]. The\u000d\u000a      predominance of a place-specific marvellous [2.6] was shown by two statues\u000d\u000a      and an everyday, ironwork object relating to the local legend of the\u000d\u000a      dragon Graoully, native of Metz. The omnipresence of the marvellous in\u000d\u000a      everyday life [2.2] was illustrated by the ironwork support of a cooking\u000d\u000a      brazier in the form of a flame-dwelling chimera. Finally, the way marvel\u000d\u000a      is intrinsic to learned as well as popular enquiry [2.3], and the crucial\u000d\u000a      role of book illustration in its propagation [2.5], were demonstrated by a\u000d\u000a      tome on giants (considered an extinct earlier form of humanity), an\u000d\u000a      illustrated plate representing the `Monstrous Pig of Metz', born in\u000d\u000a      Lorraine [2.6] with 8 legs, 4 ears and a dog's head (from a treatise on\u000d\u000a      monstrous births by anatomist and surgeon Ambroise Par&#233;), and a copy of a\u000d\u000a      1576 edition of Boaistuau's Histoires prodigieuses, the\u000d\u000a      illustrated compilation of natural wonders and monstrosities at the centre\u000d\u000a      of Bamforth's research [3.1; 3.2].\u000d\u000a    4.1.3 On receipt of the catalogue essay, the curator wrote: `Thank you\u000d\u000a      once more for your very fine text on the supernatural, prodigies and the\u000d\u000a      marvellous, which is sure to become an essential point of reference.

Two exhibition reviews\u000d\u000a      in the national press stressed this dimension: `It's the richness of a\u000d\u000a      past that combines darkness and new light that the inhabitants of Nancy\u000d\u000a      and Lorraine are invited to reappropriate and defend' (Le Monde,\u000d\u000a      20.6.13 [5.6]); `We celebrate the past of a magnificent town and the\u000d\u000a      beauty of its heritage.

In its printed form, this compilation\u000d\u000a      was a Renaissance best-seller, re-published 24 times, greatly expanded in\u000d\u000a      successive editions, and translated into English, Dutch and Spanish. It is\u000d\u000a      the single most important Renaissance work on monsters, prodigies and\u000d\u000a      monstrous births. Bamforth's discovery, an academic event that attracted\u000d\u000a      public interest and media coverage, led to a luxury Italian edition,\u000d\u000a      simultaneously published in French\/English, French\/Spanish and\u000d\u000a      French\/Italian, edited and annotated by Bamforth with facsimile\u000d\u000a      reproduction of the illuminations [3.1].

A significant feature of the edition, which\u000d\u000a      reproduced the original woodcuts, was Bamforth's detailed\u000d\u000a      contextualisation and interpretation of the illustrations, and his\u000d\u000a      exploitation of the illuminated manuscript to establish their genesis.\u000d\u000a      This focus on the centrality of the visual dimension of the marvellous, of\u000d\u000a      which the Lorraine region offers particularly rich and striking examples,\u000d\u000a      is an integral thread of his ongoing research on the scientific wonder in\u000d\u000a      Early Modern Europe [3.3].\u000d\u000a    The relevant findings of Bamforth's research are as follows:\u000d\u000a    2.1 Marvel is intrinsic to the process of enquiry in the 16th century\u000d\u000a    2.2 The exceptional and the anomalous are categories of everyday\u000d\u000a      experience\u000d\u000a    2.3 The marvellous is a shared theme in terms of learned culture and\u000d\u000a      popular culture alike\u000d\u000a    2.4 Marvel is both object and emotional response, so that the concept of\u000d\u000a      the marvellous revolves around the question of transmission and reception\u000d\u000a    2.5 The experience of marvel is primarily a visual experience and book\u000d\u000a      illustration, as well as that of popular pamphlets, has a crucial role in\u000d\u000a      its propagation\u000d\u000a    2.6 The notion of the marvel and the prodigy is often place specific and\u000d\u000a      rooted in local tradition, oral, written and visual\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39943","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"49518","Name":"Rwanda"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    4.1 The pathway to impact:\u000d\u000a    4.1.1 As indicated in section 2, Hitchcott's research on fictional\u000d\u000a      responses to the 1994 Rwanda\u000d\u000a      Genocide uncovered the significance of memorials as a focus for literary\u000d\u000a      production [2.1].

The title of Hitchcott's\u000d\u000a      article `Writing on Bones'\u000d\u000a      [3.2] alludes to the parallel commemorations of the Murambi Memorial\u000d\u000a      Centre, which displays\u000d\u000a      mummified bodies, skeletons and skulls at the site of the massacre [5.2],\u000d\u000a      and that of Diop's novel,\u000d\u000a      which inscribes both the massacre and its material memorial within its\u000d\u000a      writing.

As part of\u000a      her research interests, Marsh sought access to the posters through the\u000a      University's Manuscripts\u000a      and Special Collections (MSC) team, thus setting in motion a chain of\u000a      events that would eventually\u000a      lead to their physical exhibition and subsequent transformation into a\u000a      permanent, digitised, interactive\u000a      online resource, preserving an element of Soviet cultural heritage whose\u000a      physical fragility had\u000a      previously precluded the public from accessing it directly. 10,250 people\u000a      have thus far visited the\u000a      exhibition in either its physical or online form (5.1).\u000a    Initiated and curated by Marsh in close collaboration with the MSC team\u000a      at the University, Windows\u000a        on War: Soviet Posters 1943-45 took place at the Weston Gallery (the\u000a      University's public-facing\u000a      Lakeside Arts Centre, which draws 90% of its audience from beyond the\u000a      University) from\u000a      December 2008 to March 2009. The exhibition was underpinned by Marsh's\u000a      pre-1993 published\u000a      research on poetry and painting and on the ways in which painting inspired\u000a      pictorial passages in\u000a      Russian 19th-century prose, and her more recent exploration of\u000a      visual culture (3.1 &amp; 3.4), bodily\u000a      presence (3.2) and spatial awareness (3.2) in the theatre; and the\u000a      translation of culture through\u000a      the medium of theatre (3.4 &amp; 3.5). This was complemented by recent, as\u000a      yet unpublished research\u000a      on the nature of the ephemerality of the posters arising from their\u000a      fragility as artefacts of material\u000a      culture. This research shaped the focus of the exhibition in terms of the\u000a      topics highlighted, the\u000a      manner in which the material was displayed and the captions created to\u000a      guide visitors' under-standing.\u000a    The exhibition attracted nearly 5000 visitors (substantial for the\u000a      recorded footfall of the venue) and\u000a      provoked national and local press interest, attesting to its role in\u000a      raising public awareness of and\u000a      contributing to a wider public understanding of this previously\u000a      un-exhibited aspect of Soviet cultural\u000a      heritage.

The extent of the collection, its\u000a      rarity, and specifically its Nottingham location also stimulated the\u000a      interest of the local press (5.2).\u000a      Visitors to the exhibition found it to be an 'excellent living memory of\u000a      war childhood' and a 'peep\u000a      into history through war posters'. There were also comments on how the\u000a      posters' combinations of\u000a      image and text affected Russian emotions toward the enemy, and their\u000a      sentiments about home. A\u000a      primary school teacher commented that his\/her charges learned (after\u000a      stencilling in teams) `how\u000a      mass production of images can be quite uncreative!' (5.3).\u000a    Linked public lectures and education activities engaged children, adult\u000a      learners and a broader\u000a      general public, contributing to increased knowledge about, awareness of\u000a      and interest in Soviet\u000a      visual culture, and specific issues such as preservation through\u000a      digitisation, and the processes\u000a      involved in the creation of the posters. Feedback has been referenced\u000a      where this was sought at\u000a      the time (5.3):\u000a    \u000a      \u000aPublic lectures, such as `The Soviet War Posters in the Context\u000a        of History', by Professor Steven\u000a        White (Glasgow) ( 27.01.09; 120 attendees) traced the Russian poster\u000a        tradition's frequent reference\u000a        to history (e.g. the Napoleonic invasion) providing insights into the\u000a        specifically Russian,\u000a        rather than Soviet, sense of history in WW2.\u000a      \u000aA lunchtime talk attracted an audience of 40 people and covered\u000a        topics such as preservation\u000a        and digitisation as a repair tool; the provenance of a collection saved\u000a        by chance; reproducing\u000a        posters en masse in wartime conditions; and the paradox of the posters'\u000a        war role.\u000a      \u000aSchool education days (for 386 children and their teachers)\u000a        were organised by the Lakeside\u000a        Education Officer. Children were introduced to an archive, had a guided\u000a        tour of the exhibition,\u000a        and made their own posters. They learnt how to stencil and how teams\u000a        created the original posters.\u000a        Teacher comments: 'the children gained an insight into the poster\u000a        collection, and were\u000a        especially aware of how violent and aggressive the anti-Nazi campaign\u000a        was in Russia. They\u000a        produced very striking, if bloodthirsty, graphic images in black and red\u000a        paint' (23.2.09). Transforming\u000a        their existing knowledge, the children learnt about `persuasive picture\u000a        making' (23.02.09);\u000a        and also ' learnt a few words of Russian' (23.02.09).\u000a      \u000aAdult study day (28.02.09; 35 attendees, organised by Marsh).\u000a        Speakers gave a comprehensive\u000a        overview of the posters' role in war, their artistic inheritance as\u000a        against contemporary art policy\u000a        and their cultural legacy: The day concluded with a guided tour of the\u000a        exhibition. Participants\u000a        found the day to be `excellent', answering `a good number of questions'.\u000a      The material was utilised by a professional trainer in her\u000a        acculturating programme for businessmen\u000a        visiting Russia who considers it to have had `a great impact on me and\u000a        my work'. The trainer\u000a        was preparing a speech on `Russia at War' and subsequently visited the\u000a        archive to undertake\u000a        further research on the posters which she considered `too striking to\u000a        omit!' She has subsequently\u000a        embedded the material into three specialist talks she provides (to lay\u000a        audiences and the national\u000a        Arts charity National Association of Decorative &amp; Fine Arts\u000a        Societies (NADFAS)) (5.4).\u000a    \u000a    Using digitisation to widen access and to ensure conservation\u000a    Digitisation and online display have provided the ideal medium for the\u000a      exhibition of the fragile posters,\u000a      addressing what can otherwise be the opposing needs of public access and\u000a      conservation. The online\u000a      resource (5.1) has transformed the reach of the material, attracting new\u000a      audiences to this unique\u000a      element of Soviet cultural heritage. Its development called more deeply on\u000a      Marsh's research, since\u000a      each of the 45 posters has been fully annotated with comments on\u000a      provenance, on its role in the\u000a      war situation, on the artistic roots of the image and on the artist and\u000a      writer (where appropriate), as\u000a      well as commentary on the visual and verbal content of each poster.\u000a      Interest and use of the site\u000a      has been further stimulated by press coverage (5.2).\u000a    According to MSC's Digital Development Officer, the resource is proving\u000a      to be `exceptionally self-sustainable'\u000a      (5.5), already generating interest from educators (5.6), and from a\u000a      diverse range of\u000a      cultural organisations. It has been endorsed by groups including,\u000a      Nottingham Contemporary, the\u000a      Irish Association for Russian, Central and Eastern European Studies, the\u000a      Russian Embassy in\u000a      London, the Soviet Space Program and Academia Rossica &#8212; the Russian Arts\u000a      and Culture\u000a      Foundation.

As a\u000a      result, there is frequently\u000a      an element of spectatorship in the reception of literary forms which\u000a      relate to the visual arts. This\u000a      research necessitated detailed study of the history of Russian art as well\u000a      as of literature in the\u000a      nineteenth and early twentieth century up to 1930 (research references\u000a      pre-1993).\u000a    Secondly, in her work on Russian theatre, Marsh has focused on the\u000a      relationship between text and\u000a      performance, and, more specifically, on the factors which are the source\u000a      of a visual mode for the\u000a      written dramatic word. She has demonstrated that the key to understanding\u000a      this mode lies in an\u000a      awareness of the spatiality inherent in the dramatic text. This dimension\u000a      is seen in the visual\u000a      impact of the implied staging and the implied fictional worlds (3.1).\u000a      Spatiality can also be seen in\u000a      the use of quotation, in all its forms, and its effects on physical\u000a      performance style (3.2). Finally,\u000a      visual impact is also found in the exploration of the structural aspects\u000a      of the dramatic text which are\u000a      central to performance, such as repetition, power relationships among\u000a      characters and how these\u000a      factors determine the spatial positioning in a performance (3.3). These\u000a      characteristics are central\u000a      to what Marsh sees as the 'theatricality' of a staged dramatic text. A\u000a      significant challenge in this\u000a      research is that the manifestation of these aspects in given productions\u000a      is always, due to their\u000a      performative nature, ephemeral.\u000a    Thirdly, in her study of translated Russian theatre in Britain she has\u000a      shown the complex changes\u000a      which a dramatic text with all its visual implications undergoes in the\u000a      transfer from source to target\u000a      culture. The changes brought to a text in transmission by the chain of\u000a      practitioners who work on a\u000a      production have already been recognised, but Marsh has shown how implied\u000a      stereotypes, for\u000a      example, can fail to migrate successfully from the source culture or are\u000a      added by the target culture\u000a      and occlude aspects of the source text (3.4 &amp; 3.5).\u000a    The key findings from this research base which influenced the original\u000a      exhibition and the on-line\u000a      version are:\u000a    \u000a      the power generated by linking text and image as the posters do;\u000a      the function of text\/image in the posters and its effect on\u000a        spectatorship;\u000a      the centrality of spatial awareness in the visual composition of the\u000a        posters themselves, in\u000a        other words their 'theatricality';\u000a      the posters as vehicles of cultural transfer (however biased);\u000a      the nature of the ephemerality of the posters arising from their\u000a        fragility as artefacts of\u000a        material culture and from their status as responses to the rapidly\u000a        changing events of war.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40314","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Beumers has developed this research base to explore technologies which\u000a      were ground-breaking for their time; they are, however, no longer usable\u000a      for adequate demonstration today as the projection technology is no longer\u000a      available. These films (which have never been shown before) have therefore\u000a      been digitised and restored in order to display the original effects.\u000a      Thus, various other types and levels of impact can be measured:\u000a    \u000a      the impact on audience expectations of animation and of special\u000a        effects\u000a      the impact on animators' quests to find new and more effective ways of\u000a        achieving special effects\u000a      the impact on a comparative evaluation of the effect achieved in\u000a        different technologies, for example at Aardman and Nukufilm. This seems\u000a        particularly pertinent in the context of Aardman's announcement\u000a        (November 2011) concerning the outsourcing of stop-frame animation.\u000a    \u000a    The impact created by this research is visible in two areas:\u000a    \u000a      a two-day event at the film festival `Encounters 2012', which included\u000a        two film programmes, a workshop, and roundtable discussions.\u000a      the restoration and development of the technologies used as an\u000a        interactive museum Touch Table exhibit, also freely available as an iPad\u000a        app on Apple's App Store.\u000a    \u000a    Encounters 2012\u000a    The internationally recognised film festival `Encounters' hosted the\u000a      screening of two programmes (both on 19 September 2012), some of which\u000a      would not have been restored and digitised without Beumers' work. The\u000a      first showing consisted of 3D films, including a colour fragment from the\u000a      first stereoscopic film, and three animated films made in the\u000a      Oscar-awarded Stereo-70 system in the 1970s. The second screening\u000a      presented five animated films created during the 1930s in a three-colour\u000a      technique developed by Pavel Mershin. The screenings were held in the\u000a      largest and most prominent screen in the festival complex, and were\u000a      attended by 154 people in total (71 at the first screening and 83 at the\u000a      second) [a]. As well as providing the audience with the opportunity to see\u000a      the first ever screening of these films outside of Russia, the event\u000a      enhanced the audience's knowledge of the inter-cultural nature of film and\u000a      of how this has shaped the films we see today.\u000a    David Sproxton, Chairman of `Encounters', commented that `for many in the\u000a      audience the technical expertise and imagination of the story-telling came\u000a      as a wonderful surprise and reminded us all that films, especially\u000a      animated films, can transcend the perceived barriers of national culture\u000a      and contemporary trends' [b]. The screenings also paved the way for future\u000a      impact, as Beumers agreed with Gosfilmofond and Nukufilm (who own the\u000a      films' copyright) that she may propose the pro-gramme to other festivals,\u000a      thereby achieving a broader impact on audiences, animators and film\u000a      makers. The films have since been shown at Orosz Animacios Filmnapok,\u000a      Budapest (March 2013) and the Flatpack Festival, Birmingham UK (March\u000a      2013). The films were also programmed for the Abandon Normal Devices\u000a      Festival, Liverpool (3-5 October 2013) [c].\u000a    The screenings were followed by a workshop on film restoration (attended\u000a      by 22 people) and a roundtable on 3D in contemporary animation (attended\u000a      by 25 people), both held on 20 September 2012. Informal discussions after\u000a      the two public debates were crucial to developing the future impact of\u000a      this project; first steps were made towards projects that will see the\u000a      restoration of kinopanorama and the inclusion of Estonian\u000a      animation in `Encounters' in 2013 with `Estonian Dreams', 6 films made\u000a      2008-12 and scheduled for showing on 21 September 2013 [d].\u000a    In recognition of this work Beumers was given an `Award for the\u000a      Popularization of Russian and Soviet Cinema' by Gosfilmofond on 1 February\u000a      2013 [e].\u000a    Developing new technologies\u000a    Alongside Julia Bracegirdle (Animation Department, UWE), Beumers has been\u000a      collaborating with Aerian Studios Ltd to develop further these animation\u000a      techniques and produce a Touch Table. A prototype of this technology was\u000a      presented at the Research and Enterprise in the Arts and Creative\u000a      Technology (REACT) Showcase on 28 September 2012. The Touch Table is on\u000a      permanent display at the Theatre Collection of Bristol University's\u000a      Department of Drama but has also been shown at the Museo del Precinema\u000a      in Padua (April-July 2013) [f], which specialises in early cinematic\u000a      techniques. The research team have created a forward programme which\u000a      includes the Stummfilmtage in Bonn (August 2013) [g], the Watershed Arts\u000a      Centre, Bristol (September-October 2013) and the National Media Museum,\u000a      Bradford (November 2013). The Touch Table enables visitors to the museums\u000a      to use this innovative technology to explore the functionality of early\u000a      optical devices, such as the zoetrope, phenakistoscope and kinora;\u000a      visitors can view films of their choice by spinning them, thus replicating\u000a      the tactile experience of the original device through digital\u000a      technologies. The School of Modern Languages works closely with the\u000a      museums to ensure that the impact of the exhibit is measured through\u000a      qualitative questionnaires and by collecting visitor numbers.\u000a    In addition to attracting visitors to the museums and impacting on these\u000a      visitors, Aerian Studios have benefitted from the opportunity of learning\u000a      about and working with these new technologies, using this new expertise to\u000a      generate new Touch Table commissions from other museums, providing\u000a      significant new business revenue. In Aerian's view, `the project helped\u000a      raise awareness of the skills and ambition of our company, as well as\u000a      acting as inspiration to staff and existing clients &#8212; pushing us further\u000a      into the innovation space' [h].\u000a    The software, design and content of the Touch Table have been adapted for\u000a      a free iPad application, `Walking Pictures', which was launched in July\u000a      2013.

Her research has promoted the\u000a      restoration and digitisation of rare historical materials, permitting\u000a      their distribution to a wide audience in the UK, Germany and Italy.\u000a    External partners involved with the digitisation process have developed a\u000a      3D system used in animation today in Russia and Estonia. The research has\u000a      permitted the development of a prototype animation Touch Table with local\u000a      company Aerian Studios Ltd. The Touch Table, which animates old optical\u000a      devices, has been on public display at museums and film festivals. A\u000a      resulting iPad application `Walking Pictures' is freely available on the\u000a      App Store.

During the course of this research, Beumers discovered a\u000a      privately owned archive in St Petersburg, containing unique footage of\u000a      both drawn animation on paper and the earliest puppet animation in the\u000a      history of cinema (made between 1906 and 1909, thus preceding historically\u000a      known films by three years). These were made for amateur purposes but were\u000a      produced to extremely high standards. These research findings were\u000a      published in outputs 1, 2 and 5 listed below. The films were presented at\u000a      Pordenone Silent Film festival in 2008 and toured (along with an\u000a      exhibition and major animation and film events) in Europe and the US: see\u000a      http:\/\/avs.kinokultura.com for\u000a      events and responses.\u000a    Through her work rescuing and analysing the Shiryaev film archive,\u000a      Beumers has placed the origins of Russian film in a wider context of key\u000a      moments of technical innovation in film history. This work has generated\u000a      two lines of impact: a demonstration of `how pictures learnt to walk',\u000a      drawing extensively on the archive, and the development of animation\u000a      technologies. The project has spearheaded the restored Shiryaev archive,\u000a      with the paper films restored digitally by David Sproxton (Aardman,\u000a      Bristol) and some 17.5mm trick films digitised by Prestech (London).\u000a    Beumers' ongoing research builds on this work on early animation.\u000a      Investigating stop-frame techniques and other techniques, Beumers'\u000a      research developed into areas of special effects, especially in Soviet\u000a      cinema of the 1930s-70s. During this period, numerous unique and labour-\u000a      intensive effects were created: thus, for example, the appearance of\u000a      weightlessness in space and interplanetary journeys were copied by\u000a      American cinema when producer Roger Corman bought the rights to several\u000a      Soviet films and re-edited them for American distribution.\u000a    This research explored the first experiments with colour and 3D in Soviet\u000a      cinema, notably in animation (which serves as the `cradle' for special\u000a      effects), in the 1930s and 1970s respectively. Soviet film studios created\u000a      colour animation by using three-colour film strips - a technique that can\u000a      no longer be projected, but after digital restoration these films can be\u000a      seen again in their original intended form. In the 1970s the Scientific\u000a      Research Film- and Photo Institute (NIKFI) in Moscow also developed a\u000a      technique for 3D films, which can likewise no longer be projected on\u000a      standard projectors, but it is now possible to capture the films\u000a      digitally. On the basis of this body of research, the Estonian Ministry of\u000a      Culture (because animated 3D films were made at Tallinn's Nukufilm in the\u000a      70s), NIKFI Moscow, and the Russian State Film Archive Gosfilmofond have\u000a      agreed to accelerate the digitisation of films.\u000a    Beumers joined the University of Bristol as a Lecturer in 1994 and was\u000a      Reader in Russian Studies when she left the institution in 2012. The\u000a      research referred to here was carried out whilst she was employed by the\u000a      University of Bristol, and the impact is a direct result of this research,\u000a      which has been published in the form of authored and edited books and as\u000a      journal articles and book chapters in Russian and English.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40315","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The `Remembering Dictatorship' conference held in Bristol in summer 2011\u000a      was intended to expand the organisers' research interests beyond their\u000a      shared roots in GDR studies into memories of the Eastern Bloc, and to\u000a      provide a launch-pad for the further research and impact set out below.\u000a      Our research suggested that migrants to the UK from the post-socialist\u000a      sphere often feel that their voices are not heard or understood by their\u000a      new local community, which increases the difficulties they experience in\u000a      becoming integrated. We applied the findings of our research in order to\u000a      further multi-cultural awareness in the face of considerable prejudice\u000a      against such migrants; prejudice exacerbated by significant economic\u000a      difficulty and sometimes linked to anxieties over British identities. The\u000a      project has had, and continues to have, impact on three user-groups:\u000a    (1) The Participants\u000a    Forty-two Eastern European migrants, from eight different post-socialist\u000a      states, have participated in the project. Initially, they were asked to\u000a      share their memories in written narratives, which were posted onto the\u000a      project website for others to view and comment on (January-February 2012).\u000a      They then attended two social events, the first focused on objects from\u000a      the past (March 2012) and the second on British perceptions of Eastern\u000a      Europe (July 2012). The participants completed a questionnaire after each\u000a      event, describing their experiences of discussing their memories with\u000a      other Eastern Europeans. Following the events, ten participants took part\u000a      in semi-structured interviews where they discussed their overall\u000a      experience of participating in the project and how they would like to its\u000a      outcomes to be disseminated (August-October 2012).\u000a    The impact within this group is visible in two ways; first, their\u000a      experiences of sharing their stories with others of a similar background,\u000a      and second, the chance for them to shape and take part in the\u000a      dissemination of their views to the wider public. In their feedback,\u000a      participants typically commented that they had enjoyed discussing their\u000a      memories with a group who had similar experiences, and that this was a\u000a      rare opportunity in the UK. One participant wrote, `exchanging experiences\u000a      and thoughts is important and gives the feeling of similar experiences in\u000a      different Eastern European countries', and another, `I love talking about\u000a      my life in East Germany because I am really worried that people are just\u000a      going to forget about it. [...] I was just so happy that somebody is\u000a      interested and very, very happy to keep it alive'. The majority of\u000a      participants claimed that they now felt better informed about other\u000a      Eastern European countries. Typical comments included: `that's the\u000a      interesting part as some experiences were very similar to mine and some\u000a      completely different', a comment on new insights into the differences\u000a      between Eastern Bloc political cultures (`I thought they had the same\u000a      ideology'), reflections on differences in perspective that participants\u000a      had not previously been aware of, and `I could see something that we\u000a      couldn't see in Hungary because we didn't have much experience with other\u000a      Eastern Europeans'.\u000a    The participants' enthusiasm for helping to organise the public events\u000a      associated with the project reflects their keenness to air their stories\u000a      publicly. As well as working alongside the researchers to design the\u000a      format of the public exhibition and schools workshops, they donated an\u000a      impressive number of objects to be displayed at the exhibition, and\u000a      frequently suggested other ways in which their stories could be shared.\u000a      When discussing the idea of producing a documentary, for example, one\u000a      participant stated: `I am sure there are plenty who would be willing to\u000a      talk about their story [...], and say, \"okay, when I speak to my English\u000a      friends they avoid that topic, they always think that\"...they'll all have\u000a      that English person saying I thought this, not that'.\u000a    (2) The local community\u000a    In May 2012, Pinfold and Hyland curated a public exhibition at the MShed,\u000a      the new museum of Bristol life. This showcased the outcomes of the project\u000a      to date, a range of objects donated by the participants, and a selection\u000a      of findings from our individual research (Pinfold, for example, exhibited\u000a      a number of socialist children's books, each accompanied by a description\u000a      providing historical and social context). This event was intended to\u000a      encourage people to think beyond media stereotypes about Eastern European\u000a      migrants by providing an insight into the ways in which the group\u000a      remembers their state socialist past and views Britain. The one-day event\u000a      was visited by eighty-seven members of the public, who were able to view\u000a      the exhibits, participate in interactive activities (e.g. a quiz testing\u000a      their knowledge of Eastern Europe), and talk to the researchers and\u000a      participants (at least one researcher and one participant were present\u000a      throughout the day).\u000a    Every visitor was asked to complete a questionnaire on the event. The\u000a      feedback was over-whelmingly positive; the majority commented on how much\u000a      they had learned about Eastern Europe and migrant communities living in\u000a      Bristol, and how much they had enjoyed talking to someone with first-hand\u000a      experiences of state socialism. Remarks about the educational aspect of\u000a      the event ranged from comments on specific details to more general\u000a      insights, such as, `it was interesting to find out about the positives in\u000a      communist societies, also interesting to see an \"outside\" view of\u000a      capitalist society' - or, conversely, the `opportunity to see how life was\u000a      in the former Eastern Bloc, not from the Western point of view, but from\u000a      the Eastern one!', and `it was interesting to be made to think more about\u000a      engagement (or not) with official politics before 1989, and about mixed\u000a      attitudes pre-and post-1989 towards communism. Also interesting to think\u000a      about Western attitudes'.\u000a    (3) Secondary schools\u000a    An important activity for delivering the project's impact of raising\u000a      awareness of Eastern European life are a series of workshops at local\u000a      secondary schools based on the material provided by the participants and\u000a      the underpinning research. The first workshop was successfully piloted at\u000a      the University of Bristol's `Languages Day' in June 2012 in the `East\u000a      Meets West' session attended by sixteen A-level pupils. The feedback\u000a      highlights the development of the students' knowledge of everyday life\u000a      under state socialism, and in particular, of the experiences and\u000a      perceptions of Eastern European migrants in Bristol. The ideas students\u000a      took away from the session typically included, `contrasts between\u000a      socialist and capitalist societies', and, `first-hand opinions of people\u000a      who lived in Eastern European cultures' (cf. letters of support).\u000a    In June 2013 Pinfold spoke about post-1990 representations of GDR\u000a      childhood at an event attended by 45 pupils taking A-level history at 5\u000a      local schools. Participant narratives from the `East meets West' website\u000a      were used in interactive small group work following Pinfold's talk, in\u000a      order further to challenge the students' stereotypical preconceptions\u000a      about life in the former Eastern Bloc. Feedback from both pupils and their\u000a      teachers was extremely positive. A number of pupils referred to acquiring\u000a      `new' and `interesting' perspectives, with one noting that he was\u000a      surprised at 'how [...] normal daily life was under communism and how it\u000a      was better, in some respects, than western society.' Several teachers also\u000a      requested further resources and information about future workshops for\u000a      their own schools.\u000a    On 9 July 2013 Pinfold and Allinson conducted a full day school workshop\u000a      for year 7 pupils at Bristol Metropolitan Academy. The event was run in\u000a      collaboration with staff from the modern languages and humanities\u000a      departments and consisted of formal presentations, group discussion, and\u000a      role plays on everyday activities in both capitalist and socialist\u000a      societies, including shopping and voting, Feedback from staff and students\u000a      was highly enthuasiastic: comments on student questionnaires included `I\u000a      didn't know what communism was but now I do and how it was like'; `I\u000a      learned about the differences between socialism and capital that the\u000a      capital had more luxuries but some jobs were not paid well'; `we got to\u000a      see what it was like to shop in both capitalism + socialism. It was the\u000a      best thing ever!'; [I learned] `the East side was not so bad'; and `It was\u000a      fantastic!'\u000a    A series of secondary school resources for teachers of Personal, Social,\u000a      Health and Economic Education (PSHE), history, German and Eastern European\u000a      languages has been made available on the project's website. The website\u000a      will provide statistics on the number of downloads, and teachers have been\u000a      asked to comment on the webpage to ensure a mix of quantitative and\u000a      qualitative evidence of impact arising from the resources created.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact of this on-going project has been to raise cultural awareness\u000a      of Eastern European history and life behind the Iron Curtain by bringing\u000a      together communities of former Eastern European citizens in Bristol. It\u000a      has given those communities the opportunity to share their stories with a\u000a      group with many common experiences.

It draws on the research\u000a      of four colleagues:\u000a    \u000a      Dr Debbie Pinfold (Senior Lecturer in German), a literary \/ memory\u000a        studies scholar specialising on the literature and representations of\u000a        childhood in the GDR.\u000a      Dr Mark Allinson (Senior Lecturer in German), a historian specialising\u000a        on social and political life in the GDR.\u000a      Dr Sara Jones (Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the University of\u000a        Bristol, 2009-2011, now University of Birmingham), who worked on the\u000a        representations of the GDR \/ former Eastern Bloc in different cultural\u000a        media.\u000a      Dr Claire Hyland (Teaching and Research Fellow at the University of\u000a        Bristol, 2011-2012), who completed her doctoral thesis on perceptions of\u000a        `East-Germanness' in Berlin at the University of Bath in Spring 2012.\u000a    \u000a    All of those named were founder members of the AHRC-funded `After the\u000a      Wall' network (http:\/\/afterthewall.bangor.ac.uk,\u000a      Pinfold as CI) and have contributed to a collective publication that\u000a      presents the underpinning research for this case study.\u000a    The research approach shared here focuses on the ways in which countries\u000a      from the former Eastern Bloc, in particular East Germany, are remembered\u000a      and represented today. Allinson's work takes a historical perspective,\u000a      exploring the politicised nature of everyday life in the GDR. Pinfold and\u000a      Jones analyse processes of remembering in autobiographical literature and\u000a      in public representations, such as museums and exhibitions. Hyland focuses\u000a      on the identity construction of these post-socialist groups. All four\u000a      researchers have contributed academic work on the multiple perspectives\u000a      held within and about post-socialist states, and the ways in which these\u000a      perspectives are influenced by dominant discourse, which frequently\u000a      corresponds to conventional stereotypes about socialism and communism.\u000a      This dominant discourse all too frequently uses simplistic binaries\u000a      (victim \/ perpetrator; the oppressive state \/ private lives) that are\u000a      inadequate to explain the politicised nature and complexity of individual\u000a      citizens' everyday lives. By focusing on a range of individual memory\u000a      narratives from a range of different socialist states, the `East meets\u000a      West' project challenges conventional western images of life under state\u000a      socialism and contributes to a more nuanced public understanding of the\u000a      post-socialist community living in Bristol and beyond.\u000a    The underpinning research was collaborative in its nature and\u000a      dissemination. Pinfold was Co-Investigator (with Dr Anna Saunders, Bangor\u000a      University) on the interdisciplinary network `After the Wall:\u000a      Reconstructing and Representing the GDR' (http:\/\/afterthewall.bangor.ac.uk),\u000a      funded by the AHRC, which ran from 2009 to 2011 and applied a memory\u000a      studies approach to the GDR. Pinfold has co-edited a network volume\u000a      entitled Remembering and Rethinking the GDR: Multiple Perspectives\u000a        and Plural Authenticities (published in 2013, after a rigorous\u000a      peer-review process, by Palgrave Macmillan; cf. [1], [2], [3] below).\u000a      Underlying research by Pinfold and Jones was also published in two leading\u000a      peer-reviewed journals (see [4] and [5] below). The research project\u000a      unearthed views from multiple perspectives still held about the GDR by\u000a      those who experienced it first-hand. It also brought researchers at\u000a      Bristol into contact with a well-defined group of eyewitnesses, creating a\u000a      symbiotic relationship between researcher and research subject. This\u000a      contact with eyewitnesses was consolidated and extended by a conference\u000a      co-organised by Pinfold and Jones in summer 2011, entitled `Remembering\u000a      Dictatorship: Socialist Pasts in Post-Socialist Presents'. Pinfold and\u000a      Jones conducted an introductory meeting for those interested in\u000a      participating in the `East meets West' project as the final event of this\u000a      conference, which had also provided a number of public engagement events\u000a      to secure the interest of a wider Bristol and immigrant community.

His research grew out of extensive practical experience\u000d\u000a      of the genre,\u000d\u000a      which led to numerous television and radio programmes with the BBC and the\u000d\u000a      teaching of\u000d\u000a      Chanson fran&#231;aise as a very popular final year undergraduate\u000d\u000a      teaching option between 1993\u000d\u000a      and 2008 at the University of Bristol. In addition, Hawkins presented his\u000d\u000a      work at a number of\u000d\u000a      academic conferences in the UK and France, often supplemented with actual\u000d\u000a      performance of\u000d\u000a      Ferre's work.\u000d\u000a    `En France, tout finit par des chansons' is a well-known phrase which\u000d\u000a      sums up the\u000d\u000a      importance of chanson for the French. A song tradition that goes\u000d\u000a      back to the Middle Ages\u000d\u000a      and troubadours of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, chanson\u000d\u000a      is part of the texture of\u000d\u000a      everyday life in France &#8212; a part of the national identity and a barometer\u000d\u000a      of popular taste. In\u000d\u000a      the first academic study of chanson in English, Chanson: The\u000d\u000a        French Singer-Songwriter from\u000d\u000a        Aristide Bruant to the Present Day [3], Hawkins examines the\u000d\u000a      background to the genre and\u000d\u000a      the difficulties in defining what is and what is not chanson. The\u000d\u000a      focus of his monograph then\u000d\u000a      moves to the development of the singer-songwriter of chanson from\u000d\u000a      1900 to the present day.\u000d\u000a      This period saw the emergence of national icons from Aristide Bruant at\u000d\u000a      the end of the\u000d\u000a      nineteenth century through to internationally recognized musicians such as\u000d\u000a      Jacques Brel and\u000d\u000a      Serge Gainsbourg in the mid-twentieth. The book provides bibliographies,\u000d\u000a      discographies and\u000d\u000a      details of video recordings for each of the singer-songwriters whose work\u000d\u000a      it analyses. It is an\u000d\u000a      essential reference guide to the genre, an in-depth case history of the\u000d\u000a      adaptation of an\u000d\u000a      ancient form to the demands of the modern mass media and a model for the\u000d\u000a      analysis of the\u000d\u000a      cultural and aesthetic contribution of important song writers. The book &#8212;\u000d\u000a      widely referenced in\u000d\u000a      a 2003 collection of essays on French popular music (ed. Dauncey and\u000d\u000a      Cannon) and\u000d\u000a      described there as `the most recent and arguably most authoritative study\u000d\u000a      of the chanson'\u000d\u000a      and `an invaluable study' (p. 244) - continues to sell even after more\u000d\u000a      than a decade.\u000d\u000a      Research was also disseminated via academic and popular lecture.

He\u000d\u000a      is the least well-known of the major practitioners of the genre in the\u000d\u000a      Anglophone world, and in\u000d\u000a      several articles and conference papers Hawkins documented the reasons for\u000d\u000a      his influential\u000d\u000a      status in France. Whereas the other defining figures, such as Jacques Brel\u000d\u000a      and Georges\u000d\u000a      Brassens, had been the subject of academic studies (Poole, 2000; Tinker,\u000d\u000a      2005) and had\u000d\u000a      been translated and performed in English, Ferr&#233; had not been given\u000d\u000a      comparable attention. Of\u000d\u000a      all the figures in the chanson genre, Ferr&#233; has the strongest\u000d\u000a      links to the French poetic\u000d\u000a      tradition of the previous century, and illustrates the incorporation of\u000d\u000a      poetry into the electronic\u000d\u000a      mass media in contemporary France.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40317","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"3625428","Name":"Venezuela"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3658394","Name":"Ecuador"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the research, which is expected to continue into 2014 and\u000a      beyond, forms two related strands, as set out below.\u000a    Dissemination and changing public perceptions of the subject\u000a    50 descendants of the 19th-century adventurers contacted Brown after\u000a      using his database in the course of tracing their ancestors in South\u000a      America.Some have located new memoirs which are in press as a result.\u000a      Brown was approached by Verso publishers to provide a new and accessible\u000a      translation and edition of the writings of Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var. This was\u000a      published in 2009 [= 3 above].The Venezuelan Embassy in London consulted\u000a      with Brown to select a group of memoirs written by British and Irish\u000a      mercenaries, to be translated into Spanish for the first time and\u000a      published in 2014 as part of the bicentenary of Venezuelan independence by\u000a      Monte Avila Editores in Caracas. These popular editions will be widely\u000a      distributed to ensure maximum dissemination of these new perspectives on\u000a      the geopolitical context of independence, as part of the Venezuelan\u000a      government's own academic impact agenda [a].\u000a    Brown has given ten invited public lectures as part of the commemoration\u000a      of the bicentenaries of independence, for example in Medell&#237;n (2007 &amp;\u000a      2011), Salamanca (2009), London (2009, 2010, 2012), Paris (2010), Bogot&#225;\u000a      (2010) and Caracas (2011). The lectures in Medell&#237;n were financed by the\u000a      Mayor of Medell&#237;n, while the lectures in Caracas were financed by the\u000a      British Council in Venezuela. One event was hosted by the Venezuelan\u000a      Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was the subject of a tweet in which the\u000a      Minister for Latin America, Temir Porras, drew the attention of his then\u000a      13,000 followers to the `shared history' of Britain and Venezuela, and was\u000a      considered valuable by the British Embassy in Caracas [b]. In April 2011,\u000a      Brown spoke at the Venezuelan Solidarity Campaign conference `Defending\u000a      the Majority, Not Punishing the Poorest' in London, discussing the history\u000a      of bilateral solidarity movements. At the other end of the political\u000a      scale, in April 2012, Brown spoke at the Annual Meeting of the\u000a      Anglo-Venezuelan society, leading a discussion chaired by the head of\u000a      Diageo Latin America on how the historical relationship between the two\u000a      countries can be a basis for contemporary business relations. A total of\u000a      700 people, from members of the general public and political activists to\u000a      diplomats and business leaders, have attended these talks. This major\u000a      public engagement initiative has led to changing cultural perceptions of\u000a      independence and Britain's role in it. Press reports and audience reaction\u000a      documenting this impact are available on the Bolivarian Times blog\u000a      [h], which was launched in October 2011 and as of 11 November 2013 had\u000a      received 10,529 hits. Users accessing the blog (published in English and\u000a      Spanish) come from across the world, including Spanish America, the US and\u000a      Europe. The blog has brought the research to the attention of new groups,\u000a      including French divers and archaeologists investigating the shipwreck of\u000a      the `Indian', which crashed off the coast near Brest in 1817, the\u000a      descendants of several volunteers from the 1810s, and an American family\u000a      who found an unpublished travel diary from 1819 and plan to transcribe and\u000a      publish it on the blog.\u000a    In September 2012, Brown organised `Britain and the Independence of the\u000a      Bolivarian Republics', a one-day event at Canning House in London. One\u000a      hundred people attended, including (according to questionnaires)\u000a      economists, engineers, retired diplomats, teachers, academics, filmmakers,\u000a      FCO researchers, social workers and community organisers, with a 50\/50 mix\u000a      of Britons and Latin Americans. The first session featured papers from the\u000a      leading global academic researchers on the subject: Racine (Guelph,\u000a      Canada), Gutierrez (Externado, Colombia) and Mondolfi (Metropolitana,\u000a      Venezuela). The second session was an open debate about Britain's links\u000a      with Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, led by public historians Quintero\u000a      (UCV, Caracas) and Sobrevilla (Kent) and by the serving ambassadors from\u000a      Venezuela and Colombia. Every word spoken at the event was transcribed and\u000a      published on Bolivarian Times in both Spanish and English. This\u000a      included a Public Letter agreed by the audience at the event and addressed\u000a      to the U.K. Minister for Latin America, Hugo Swire MP. Audience members\u000a      stated that their preconceptions had been overturned. Typical comments\u000a      from the audience questionnaires include [g]: `this has kindled my\u000a      interest both in the history and in the present' (retired teacher);\u000a      `plenty of stimulating ideas on how to strengthen relations and take this\u000a      forward' (serving FCO diplomat); `I was surprised by the influence on\u000a      emerging South American republics of English institutions and practices'\u000a      (retired engineer); `I enjoyed the excellence of historically-based\u000a      research [combined with] political insights' (Director-General, Canning\u000a      House); `Very interesting to see the extent of interest and the common\u000a      interest in finding a historical basis for promoting good international\u000a      relations today' (business person); `it was very interesting and has\u000a      inspired me to read more about the period [...]. I was surprised at how\u000a      many people were interested in Mary English (my great great great great\u000a      grandmother) and had read my grandmother's book about her. Also I had not\u000a      heard before about the discovery of the wreck of the Indian' (legal\u000a      publishing editor).\u000a    In December 2012 Hugo Swire MP replied to the letter: `I would like to\u000a      congratulate you on your successful event on 5 September. I know that a\u000a      number of officials from Americas Directorate at the FCO attended the\u000a      event and thought it was excellent. There was an impressive and\u000a      distinguished turnout and a discussion of many useful themes. We are\u000a      pleased that attendees wanted to see stronger relations between the UK and\u000a      Latin America'. As a direct result of the success of this event, the FCO\u000a      supported Canning House in organising a series of ten historical lectures\u000a      on Latin America in 2013: Brown gave one of these, attended by 50 people\u000a      including the family of Thomas Cochrane, one of the mercenaries discussed\u000a      in the original research. The Minister concluded his letter thanking the\u000a      event for its `suggestions on how we might further strengthen our\u000a      relations with Latin America' and promising to pass on ideas regarding\u000a      language and history plans to `forge modern, adaptive relationships in the\u000a      region' [d].\u000a    In late September 2012, Brown was interviewed by the BBC website on this\u000a      subject. There were 427 comments, which led to a spike in hits on the\u000a      blog.\u000a    In November 2012, Brown was a major academic contributor to BBC Radio 4's\u000a      `The Invention of Spain' series on the independence of Latin America.\u000a      Other contributors were recorded by the BBC at the 5\/19\/12 Canning House\u000a      event. The programme attracted 2 million listeners and attracted wide\u000a      enthusiasm across the UK and Spain, with typical online comments being\u000a      that `it should be required listening for anyone wanting to understand\u000a      Spanish and Latin American history'. The success of this programme has led\u000a      to a role for Brown as a regular media commentator on Latin American\u000a      issues, e.g. on the death of Hugo Ch&#225;vez (BBC World Service, BBC Bristol,\u000a      BBC News24, March 2013) and on social unrest in Brazil (BBC Scotland\u000a      Newsweek, June 2013).\u000a    In December 2012, Brown was invited to work with teachers of Spanish in\u000a      UK schools on this subject, specifically to help them incorporate coverage\u000a      of it into their teaching in order to revitalise students' interest in\u000a      Latin American history. The seminar was organised and funded by the\u000a      Prince's Teaching Institute. A London schoolteacher said in her feedback\u000a      that `[a]s someone with a very keen interest in Latin America I couldn't\u000a      have been more interested or inspired by your talk' [i].\u000a    British Policy towards Latin America\u000a    The era studied in this research project constitutes the last period of\u000a      clear British policy towards Latin America (which, in brief, was to\u000a      influence local politicians in order to secure preferential trade\u000a      relations, with a strict emphasis on the abolition of the slave trade and\u000a      establishing independence from all European imperial powers, especially\u000a      France). Greater knowledge of the implementation of that policy in\u000a      Colombia and Venezuela has been drawn upon in recent reconfigurations of\u000a      British Latin America policy, and in diplomatic bilateral representations\u000a      more generally [e]. The effect of Brown's research can be seen in the\u000a      House of Lords debate on the subject (24 June 2010) [j].\u000a    At the annual conference of the Society for Latin American Studies,\u000a      hosted by the University of Bristol in April 2010, there was a\u000a      high-profile public debate sponsored by Santander Group. Speakers included\u000a      the then Minister for Latin America, Chris Bryant MP, H.E. Samuel Moncada,\u000a      the Venezuelan Ambassador to the UK, and representatives of the NGOs Oxfam\u000a      and Transform. The subject was `British Policy in Latin America: Is there\u000a      one, and what should it be?' This forum led to direct public policy\u000a      declarations from the minister regarding Latin America, specifically on\u000a      covert involvement in the Colombian violent conflict, which had never\u000a      happened before. When he became Foreign Secretary after the 2010 election,\u000a      William Hague MP made a policy speech on Latin America (the first Foreign\u000a      Secretary to do so), the first page of which drew implicitly on Brown's\u000a      research on Britain in Latin America during the independence period [c].\u000a    The FCO has been one of the most enthusiastic promoters of Brown's\u000a      research. In July 2011, Brown travelled to Caracas to give a week of talks\u000a      on the subject of this research as part of the British Embassy \/ British\u000a      Council events to commemorate independence. In January 2012, he was\u000a      invited to speak to Latin-Americanist desk-officers at the FCO on the\u000a      subject.\u000a    The event at Canning House in September 2012 referred to above led to the\u000a      writing of an open letter to the new Secretary of State with\u000a      responsibility for Latin America, Hugo Swire, outlining how best Britain\u000a      could build on its historic relationship with Colombia, Venezuela and\u000a      Ecuador.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Politicians and diplomats in Britain and Latin America, together with\u000a      descendants of the 7,000 British and Irish mercenaries who served under\u000a      Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var between 1810 and 1830, have benefited over the past five\u000a      years from fresh insights into how Britain helped Colombia and Venezuela\u000a      achieve independence from colonial rule.

Led by Sim&#243;n Bolivar, these struggles involved mercenaries from\u000a      Britain and Ireland and still have resonance today.\u000a    The key researcher, Matthew Brown, now Reader in Latin American Studies\u000a      at the University of Bristol, laid the foundations for this research\u000a      through archival studies he conducted internationally between 2000 and\u000a      2004 while a doctoral student at University College London. He was a\u000a      Teaching Fellow in Bristol's Department of Hispanic, Portuguese and Latin\u000a      American Studies in 2004-05, and was appointed Lecturer in July 2005.\u000a      Brown conducted further substantive archival research in Colombia, Spain,\u000a      Venezuela and the UK in 2004 - 2011, during which period he became Senior\u000a      Lecturer and then Reader at Bristol. All of the qualitative and\u000a      quantitative analysis that shaped the relevant publications and their\u000a      impact was done after his employment at Bristol began in 2005, drawing on\u000a      contextual information and the preliminary analyses advanced in his\u000a      doctoral thesis.\u000a    Nature of the research\u000a    Before this research project began, little was known about British\u000a      participation in the independence of Colombia and Venezuela, although some\u000a      military officers were commemorated in Bogot&#225; and Caracas because of their\u000a      heroic involvement in certain key battles of the armed conflict. Brown\u000a      undertook quantitative analysis of military service records in Colombia,\u000a      Venezuela and the UK and created a Filemaker Pro database of the lives and\u000a      careers of over 3,000 of the mercenaries which went beyond the military\u000a      focus and anecdotal nature of previous research. His qualitative analysis\u000a      explored the social, cultural, economic and political interventions of the\u000a      British and Irish mercenaries in the region &#8212; a topic hitherto untouched\u000a      by scholars.\u000a    The research outputs (detailed below) were underpinned by the\u000a      construction of a prosopographical database of foreign mercenaries who\u000a      served in the wars of independence in Colombia and Venezuela, published\u000a      online as a genealogical tool at http:\/\/www.bris.ac.uk\/hispanic\/latin\/research.\u000a      The database contains previously unpublished information on origins,\u000a      names, dates of birth and death, professions and activities of all the\u000a      known participants in the expeditions which assisted Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var. Other\u000a      outputs using this information include a monograph and several articles on\u000a      the subject, analysing the encounter between the British and Colombians\u000a      with particular regard to subjects such as honour codes, marriage,\u000a      pensions, race, slavery and national identity. This research led to Brown\u000a      being invited to organise and edit a new release of biographies for the Oxford\u000a        Dictionary of National Biography (2009) on `Britons and Latin\u000a      America', including researching and writing six of the biographies\u000a      himself, with two further biographies commissioned for 2014.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40823","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2629691","Name":"Iceland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Angouri's research has had impact on two levels, (a) on the way teamwork\u000a      and team communication is understood by the project team and (b) on\u000a      training that was developed as a result of the study. More specifically:\u000a    Economic and societal impacts:\u000a    The team's findings have been used to revise and update relevant guidance\u000a      and chapters in the 2nd Edition of the PROMPT 2 (PRactical Obstetric\u000a      Multi-Professional Training) course manual, which is used for\u000a      multi-professional training of maternity staff in the South West, the UK\u000a      and around the world (corroborating source CS1). The manual is part of a\u000a      training package focused on obstetric emergencies.\u000a    The team's findings have been used in three course programmes: (a) local\u000a      PROMPT courses at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, (b) a train-the-trainers\u000a      days at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and (c)\u000a      SMASH (Saving Mothers with Advanced Simulation scenarios for High-risk\u000a      situations) course.\u000a    Specifically:\u000a    A. Multi-professional teams from individual maternity units attend a\u000a      PROMPT Train the Trainers day and take the package back to their own unit\u000a      to train all of their maternity staff. By July 2013 PROMPT had reached\u000a      most maternity units in England. The trainees are Obstetricians,\u000a      Anaesthetists, and Midwives (all trainers in their own respective units).\u000a    The team's findings have been used in the Teamwork Chapter of the manual\u000a      and have been used for teamwork and leadership training generally threaded\u000a      throughout debriefing in all practical sessions (discussions being 5-10\u000a      minutes at 6 drills stations). The courses have been held every two months\u000a      at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, and 50-60 participants were trained each\u000a      time, a total of over 300 per year (or 900 since 2009-2010). They have\u000a      therefore had impact both regionally and nationally. Feedback forms (CS2)\u000a      indicate that the participants have developed awareness of the\u000a      significance of teamwork and team communication for improved clinical\u000a      practice.\u000a    B. Teamwork, as elucidated in our findings, has been a central part of\u000a      train-the-trainers courses held at the Royal College of Obstetricians and\u000a      Gynaecologists. Teamwork is a chapter in both the Trainee and the Trainers\u000a      manuals (Trainee manual, Module 1 Teamwork p1-13 but also thread\u000a      throughout the manual; Trainer manual, Module 3 Teamwork p17-25 and\u000a      throughout). These courses have been held four times per year with 8-16\u000a      teams of trainers from maternity units around the UK, and also around the\u000a      world, being trained. In this area again the research's impact has had\u000a      both national and international reach. The second edition of PROMPT 2 was\u000a      introduced in June 2012. 52 UK maternity units (208 multi-professional\u000a      trainers) have already been trained. Feedback forms (CS3) show that the\u000a      courses met the needs of the participants and were relevant to the\u000a      trainees' everyday practice.\u000a    C. The team's findings have also informed the regional advanced SMASH\u000a      (Saving Mothers with Advanced Simulation scenarios for High-risk\u000a      situations) course for senior maternity staff (labour ward leaders). This\u000a      is a one-day course held yearly. The course started with a lecture on\u000a      teamwork and leadership (delivered by a team member) based on our\u000a      findings. The PowerPoint slides (CS4) for this course drew directly on the\u000a      research. These were followed by six stations with extensive 20-30 minutes\u000a      debriefing between stations, using formative checklists based on our work.\u000a      Anaesthetists, Obstetricians, and Midwives have attended (20-25\u000a      participants). The course feedback indicates high satisfaction and\u000a      relevance to improving clinical practice (see letter of support from\u000a      trainee, corroborating source CS5).\u000a    PROMPT has had a national and international impact on medical\u000a      professionals' training. Outside the UK, PROMPT 2 is used in Australia,\u000a      New Zealand, Hong Kong, China, USA, Iceland, Belgium and Ireland. The\u000a      PROMPT 2 edition, which includes the teamwork research jointly led by Dr\u000a      Angouri, is listed as the fastest-selling book ever published by the RCOG\u000a      Press.

NHS litigation costs have also been\u000a      associated with poor teamwork. Teamwork has therefore been identified as a\u000a      training priority (e.g. the UK House of Commons report on the need for NHS\u000a      to improve team work). However, teamwork training does not draw on any\u000a      standard curriculum. A model borrowed from aviation-related studies on\u000a      teamwork training is often used as the basis for training. Since joining\u000a      the University of the West of England (UWE), Bristol, as a Senior Lecturer\u000a      (2007-2013) Dr Jo Angouri has conducted research in health-care discourse.\u000a      Since 2009 she has been collaborating with a multidisciplinary team on the\u000a      project that led to the impact presented here. The project was carried out\u000a      in 2009-10. Angouri was a core team member, the only linguist on the team,\u000a      and oversaw the analysis of the discourse. She was line manager for one\u000a      Research Associate, Dr Katherine Bristowe (UWE, Nov 2009 &#8212; Oct 2010).\u000a      Angouri's (UWE) input led to a change of mindset in relation to the\u000a      importance of team talk and to the breadth and depth of linguistic\u000a      analyses in the design.\u000a    The aim of the underpinning research was to investigate what makes\u000a      certain ad hoc teams interactionally more effective than others in\u000a      the hospital context and what this means for clinicians and patients.\u000a    Overall we found that the following patterns were associated with\u000a      significantly better team performance: using structured handovers,\u000a      declaring what the emergency is early and following a linear interactional\u000a      pattern in which the team leader directed a message to a named\u000a      interlocutor who acknowledged, executed and confirmed task completion.\u000a      Explicit information about the nature of emergency, condition of baby and\u000a      mother and treatment plan was also associated with better teamwork by\u000a      patient actors.\u000a    During the life of the project we conducted three studies which are\u000a      discussed in detail below.\u000a    Studies A and B built on the Simulation and Fire-drill Evaluation\u000a      (SaFE) study, a randomised controlled trial which investigated the\u000a      effectiveness of training for obstetric emergencies. In Study A,\u000a      108 randomly selected maternity professionals in 18 teams in six hospitals\u000a      in Southwest England were videoed managing a patient-actor in a simulated\u000a      emergency. The team set the administration of an essential drug as a\u000a      surrogate, from a clinical perspective, for team efficiency and patient\u000a      outcome. Clinically better teams were likely to have stated the emergency\u000a      earlier and were more likely to have used a tight control of the floor\u000a      with the addressor allocating tasks and the message being directed to an\u000a      addressee, acknowledged, executed and confirmed. Better teams also tended\u000a      to have more structured handovers.\u000a    Study B found that there was a significant correlation between\u000a      patient-actor perception of communication, and the number and duration of\u000a      communication episodes. Patient-actor perception of safety was better when\u000a      the content of the communication episodes included: possible cause(s) of\u000a      the emergency, the condition of their baby, and the ultimate treatment\u000a      (need to expedite delivery).\u000a    Study C aimed to go beyond simulated data and analyse the\u000a      perceptions of health care professionals about effective teamwork in\u000a      medical emergencies. Focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed by\u000a      Bristowe (UWE), and coded and analysed (by Angouri\/Bristowe, UWE, Hambly,\u000a      Frenchay Hospital, Siassakos, Southmead Hospital). Findings indicated that\u000a      awareness of the clinical situation, the patient's needs, and of the team\u000a      members' roles were perceived as crucial for team performance and clinical\u000a      outcome. The availability of senior clinicians also emerged as central for\u000a      the management of emergencies.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40828","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Sakel's research on Moset&#233;n has benefitted the speakers, as well as the\u000a      wider community, in two\u000a      distinct ways:\u000a    a) establishing bilingual education programmes, and;\u000a    b) raising awareness and changing attitudes.\u000a    Both of these have contributed to the maintenance and long-term\u000a      sustainability of the Moset&#233;n\u000a      language.\u000a    a) Sakel's research made it possible to establish bilingual education\u000a      programmes for the\u000a      Mosetenes [6]. This was in part facilitated by Sakel's accessible\u000a      Spanish-language\u000a      grammar for the language, as well as Sakel's training of Moset&#233;n speakers\u000a      in the\u000a      preparation of educational materials. For example, Sakel's main Moset&#233;n\u000a      collaborator [1],\u000a      was involved in the preparation of a number of these educational materials\u000a      [6], based on\u000a      his status as `bilingual educator' due to his work with Sakel [1], as well\u000a      as his previous\u000a      experience in developing a range of teaching materials for Moset&#233;n in\u000a      collaboration with\u000a      Sakel [4]. Sakel arranged for these materials to be shared online [4], to\u000a      be accessed by the\u000a      speakers and educators (as well as found via a simple Google search) [5].\u000a    b) Sakel's work has raised awareness of the Moset&#233;n language and has\u000a      contributed to a\u000a      change in attitudes towards the language by its speakers as well as by\u000a      outsiders. According\u000a      to the evidence given by a German Aid worker based in Bolivia who wrote\u000a      her PhD thesis\u000a      about conflicts between Mosetenes and other actors in the region [2], the\u000a      Spanish-\u000a      language grammar has given the speakers a way of authenticating the fact\u000a      that they speak\u000a      a full language, not a mere dialect. It has put Moset&#233;n on the Bolivian\u000a      map alongside much\u000a      larger and dominant indigenous languages, such as Aymara and Quechua.\u000a      Sakel's work on\u000a      Moset&#233;n has led to a measurable change in mind-set and identity amongst\u000a      the speakers of\u000a      Moset&#233;n. While the language can still be considered endangered today, many\u000a      speakers\u000a      have become aware of the value of Moset&#233;n, both as a good among the people\u000a      themselves, but also as a marker of ethnic identity that can be exploited\u000a      in their newly\u000a      developed projects of eco-tourism. This change in attitudes towards the\u000a      Moset&#233;n language\u000a      was documented by the German Aid worker in her study of the conflicts and\u000a      relations\u000a      between peoples in the region, in which the status of the Moset&#233;n language\u000a      played a\u000a      central role [2] (originally in Spanish). She concluded that \"a new\u000a      awareness of the\u000a      importance of the native language\" has arisen as a result of Sakel's work.\u000a    It is possible to measure the impact of Sakel's research in the following\u000a      ways:\u000a    Testimonials.\u000a    1) by a prominent Moset&#233;n speaker who became a locally recognised\u000a      authority and bilingual\u000a      educator through his work with Sakel [1].\u000a    2) by an Austrian neurologist, who worked with the Mosetenes during\u000a      2012-13 and who testifies to\u000a      the use of Moset&#233;n today, as well as the status of [1] as an authority in\u000a      his language through his\u000a      work with Sakel [2].\u000a    3) by a German geographer based in Bolivia, who wrote her PhD thesis\u000a      (2010) on conflicts\u000a      between Mosetenes and settlers in the Moset&#233;n region and who is now\u000a      working as an aid worker\u000a      in lowland Bolivia. She testifies to Sakel's influence in changing\u000a      attitudes towards the Moset&#233;n\u000a      language, which she both encountered through her own research on the\u000a      group, as well as by living\u000a      in the community and gaining an in-depth knowledge of the people and their\u000a      language. She\u000a      comments that \"the current Bolivian Government tries to introduce\u000a      bilingual education in the\u000a      regional native languages... and this would be impossible without the\u000a      professional materials\u000a      provided by Dr Sakel\" [3].\u000a    Statistics from Sakel's Academia profile\u000a    These show the access to materials made available online by Sakel and\u000a      include educational\u000a      materials provided by Huasna and Sakel [4], as well as a pre-publication\u000a      version of Sakel's\u000a      Spanish-language grammar of Moset&#233;n and Chimane [5].

Comparing the basic\u000a      aspects of the grammar of both languages, Sakel set out to highlight the\u000a      overall similarities and\u000a      differences between the languages. These were summarised and presented in\u000a      a Spanish-\u000a      language grammar of the two languages [1]. The intended audiences for this\u000a      grammar were\u000a    (a) the speakers of the languages, and\u000a    (b) the Bolivian and general Spanish-speaking public.\u000a    The grammar was also produced to inform efforts to introduce bilingual\u000a      education into Moset&#233;n\u000a      schools. For these reasons grammatical terminology was kept to a basic\u000a      level with clear\u000a      explanations.\u000a    Related to this, Sakel conducted further work on the Moset&#233;n language.\u000a      Sakel looked at the way\u000a      the argument systems of Moset&#233;n and Chimane are built up [2], comparing\u000a      these to other\u000a      languages of the world. The insights from this research were also informed\u000a      by the work on the\u000a      Spanish-language grammar [1], as this is a part of the grammar where the\u000a      two languages differ.\u000a      Additionally, Sakel studied the verbal system of Moset&#233;n in greater\u000a      detail, looking at the ways in\u000a      which verbs can be classified into different categories [3].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41269","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The first stage of the impact predates the REF period, but is important\u000d\u000a      as a model for subsequent\u000d\u000a      impact. The RSC's Spanish Golden Age Season sold out in Stratford,\u000d\u000a      Newcastle, Madrid (where it\u000d\u000a      won the prestigious Critics Award), and in London's West End, and the RSC\u000d\u000a      views House of\u000d\u000a        Desires `as one of the great successes of the RSC's award winning\u000d\u000a      season of Spanish Golden Age\u000d\u000a      Plays' (5.1.2). Within the REF period, there have been at least six known\u000d\u000a      productions of House of\u000d\u000a        Desires in the UK and USA, including three university productions\u000d\u000a      and three commercial ones, and\u000d\u000a      a number of further readings. Each corroborative statement cites Boyle's\u000d\u000a      translation as the\u000d\u000a      motivation for the production: the director of the Duke University\u000d\u000a      production saying that `Catherine\u000d\u000a      Boyle's contemporary translation makes the piece very accessible for\u000d\u000a      modern audiences' (5.1.3),\u000d\u000a      and a University of Massachusetts Sor Juana calls the translation `by far\u000d\u000a      the best' of those\u000d\u000a      available (5.3.1). In 2012, the Royal Shakespeare Company returned to Sor\u000d\u000a      Juana In&#233;s de la Cruz,\u000d\u000a      in Heresy of Love, a play by Helen Edmundson based on her life\u000d\u000a      story (audience figures: 7,641).\u000d\u000a    The author indicates Boyle's `invaluable contribution' to the play,\u000d\u000a      saying that `it was after seeing\u000d\u000a      Catherine Boyle's translation of Sor Juana's play ... at the RSC ... that\u000d\u000a      I became interested in the\u000d\u000a      life of Sor Juana and decided I wanted to make her the subject of a play'\u000d\u000a      (5.3.2). Boyle acted as\u000d\u000a      academic expert for the company through discussions with the director and\u000d\u000a      writer, and workshops\u000d\u000a      with the actors, and `really inspired everyone to further reading and\u000d\u000a      research' (5.3.2).\u000d\u000a    The impact of cultural and historical research on the practice of\u000d\u000a      rehearsing the translated text was\u000d\u000a      tested through the process of developing Boyle's translation of Las\u000d\u000a        brutas \/ Beasts by Juan\u000d\u000a      Radrig&#225;n (Chile). Development took place in the context of the\u000d\u000a      `Translating Cultural Extremity'\u000d\u000a      project, and a dramatised reading performed for an audience of theatre\u000d\u000a      professionals, students\u000d\u000a      and researchers at King's College London (2010). In 2010 the script won an\u000d\u000a      `Everyone has the\u000d\u000a      Right' award in the competition run by iceandfire theatre and Amnesty\u000d\u000a      International, one of five\u000d\u000a      plays chosen `following an overwhelming response for development and\u000d\u000a      performance at Amnesty\u000d\u000a      International's Human Rights Action Centre' (5.2.1). The development of\u000d\u000a      the work through\u000d\u000a      sustained dialogue between academic research, the process of rehearsal and\u000d\u000a      active engagement\u000d\u000a      with new theatres and audiences &#8212; led to the programming of a full\u000d\u000a      production at Theatre 503,\u000d\u000a      London (2011). The run attracted an audience of more than 3000 and\u000d\u000a      received consistently\u000d\u000a      excellent reviews, being a Guardian critics' recommendation for the entire\u000d\u000a      run, and also received\u000d\u000a      press coverage in Chile (5.2.3). Premiered in the aftermath of the London\u000d\u000a      riots, its resonance with\u000d\u000a      contemporary Britain was noted by a number of critics: `the play resounds\u000d\u000a      strongly in today's\u000d\u000a      political climate' (5.2.3); `the production as a whole makes a case for\u000d\u000a      the play as a work of\u000d\u000a      considerable power and importance' (5.2.3); `Beasts is a demanding,\u000d\u000a      passionate play, and with\u000d\u000a      deprivation and marginalisation so high on the current domestic agenda,\u000d\u000a      its UK premiere could not\u000d\u000a      come at a better time' (5.2.3). Another said: `The kind of production that\u000d\u000a      gnaws away at the soul,\u000d\u000a      Las brutas is rarely easy but beautifully haunting and highly\u000d\u000a      recommended' (5.2.3). A series of\u000d\u000a      talks engaged the theatre-going community, and a young director was\u000d\u000a      mentored (through an Out of\u000d\u000a      the Wings competition) in the staging of a reading of a second Radrig&#225;n\u000d\u000a      play, Hechos consumados\u000d\u000a        \/ When All is Said and Done.\u000d\u000a    In 2012, Boyle joined the advisory board of the CASA Festival of Latin\u000d\u000a      American theatre, and has\u000d\u000a      co-curated a series of readings of Latin American plays in translation,\u000d\u000a      most of which are sourced\u000d\u000a      through the Out of the Wings database. According to the CASA director,\u000d\u000a      around `500 people have\u000d\u000a      discovered new Latin American plays that have come about thanks to OOTW,\u000d\u000a      while about 3000\u000d\u000a      have seen my version of Fuenteovejuna that was so influenced by\u000d\u000a      OOTW resources' (5.3.3). The\u000d\u000a      OOTW project is described by CASA as `an essential database for the\u000d\u000a      heritage of Spanish and\u000d\u000a      Latin Americans living in the UK' and as `supporting CASA to evolve as an\u000d\u000a      organisation by opening\u000d\u000a      the possibilities for interdisciplinary and cross cultural projects'\u000d\u000a      (5.3.3).\u000d\u000a    Out of the Wings created the opportunity for a young director to do a\u000d\u000a      full production of a play from\u000d\u000a      the archive through an open competition, judged by London theatre\u000d\u000a      professionals. The winning\u000d\u000a      group, Silver Lining Theatre company, premiered the translation of a play\u000d\u000a      by the major Argentine\u000d\u000a      dramatist Griselda Gambaro, Los siameses \/ Siamese Twins, by\u000d\u000a      King's-based Out of the Wings\u000d\u000a      Post-doctoral Research Assistant, Dr Gwen MacKeith. The director gives\u000d\u000a      testimony of the impact\u000d\u000a      of the `phenomenal' experience on her practice, her understanding of\u000d\u000a      theatre traditions and of `a\u000d\u000a      greater understanding and confidence in a method of translating\u000d\u000a      Spanish-language texts through\u000d\u000a      workshops with actors' (5.3.5).This expanded the impact of the research\u000d\u000a      into the formation of\u000d\u000a      young directors and actors through: mentoring in the translation process;\u000d\u000a      the introduction of the\u000d\u000a      play work to a new demographic (also through its publication by Oberon\u000d\u000a      Books); diverse\u000d\u000a      opportunities for public engagement.

The\u000d\u000a      initial research on which this case study is based was carried out by\u000d\u000a      Boyle for her PhD thesis on\u000d\u000a      Chilean theatre in dictatorship, the publication of which (as Chilean\u000d\u000a        Theater, 1973 - 1985.\u000d\u000a        Marginality, Power and Seflhood, 1992) and all subsequent research\u000d\u000a      have been completed since\u000d\u000a      Boyle joined King's. The study of theatre as in a complex relationship\u000d\u000a      with the context from which\u000d\u000a      iit emerges,and sustained engagement with practice through translation and\u000d\u000a      performance have\u000d\u000a      opened up innovative ways of exploring Hispanic theatre. An\u000d\u000a      inter-disciplinary methodology\u000d\u000a      engages with cultural history and the socio-political, intellectual and\u000d\u000a      creative contexts for the\u000d\u000a      formation of new writing and new theatre audiences and environments.\u000d\u000a      Through this approach\u000d\u000a      Boyle has forged methodologies for the study of theatre as a complex\u000d\u000a      process of production, and it\u000d\u000a      is this `thickness' of cultural analysis that in turn informs the approach\u000d\u000a      to translation and\u000d\u000a      performance. The researcher becomes an active mediator between cultures,\u000d\u000a      and academic\u000d\u000a      knowledge is positioned in interaction with creative processes. Shadowing\u000d\u000a      theatre translation in\u000d\u000a      practice, the language of research has to communicate across the different\u000d\u000a      stages of interpretation\u000d\u000a      and interrogation of the text that form the process of the movement of the\u000d\u000a      theatre text from one\u000d\u000a      place to another. The research is informed by the desire that is at the\u000d\u000a      heart of all translation: to see\u000d\u000a      the text brought to life in a new place and time, forcing engagement with\u000d\u000a      a new complexity of\u000d\u000a      production and research.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research and methodology was called on by the Royal\u000d\u000a      Shakespeare Company\u000d\u000a      for their Spanish Golden Age Season in 2004. Boyle was called upon as an\u000d\u000a      academic expert on\u000d\u000a      Latin American theatre and as the translator of Los empe&#241;os de una\u000d\u000a        casa (House of Desires [3.2])\u000d\u000a      by Sor Juana In&#233;s de la Cruz, a play for which she had already\u000d\u000a      acted as academic advisor and\u000d\u000a      dramaturge (Battersea, 1993). The model of research and collaboration\u000d\u000a      developed through this\u000d\u000a      season, which defied the usual distinctions between `academic' and\u000d\u000a      `creative', was explored in a\u000d\u000a      edited volume of essays [3.3] and was the source of the AHRC-funded\u000d\u000a      project, `Spanish and\u000d\u000a      Spanish American Theatre in Translation.

With Boyle as PI, and co-investigators Professor\u000d\u000a      David Johnston [Queen's University Belfast], Dr Jonathan Thacker\u000d\u000a      [University of Oxford] (both of\u000d\u000a      whom worked on the RSC season) and Paul Spence [Digital Humanities, King's\u000d\u000a      College London],\u000d\u000a      the project has created a virtual Spanish-language theatre environment,\u000d\u000a      designed to emulate a\u000d\u000a      `real' theatre environment. That is, it provides the body of knowledge\u000d\u000a      that informs the\u000d\u000a      understanding of theatre production within specific cultures, and is\u000d\u000a      structured around research\u000d\u000a      expertise across the Hispanic world in theatre historiography, translation\u000d\u000a      theory and methodologies\u000d\u000a      for performance.\u000d\u000a    In the context of this project, Boyle gained further funding for the\u000d\u000a      development of work with\u000d\u000a      practitioners on `Translating Cultural Extremity' (3.1). Three core areas\u000d\u000a      of investigation inform this\u000d\u000a      project: i) the linguistic translation of culturally distant theatre; ii)\u000d\u000a      the `transportation' of plays from\u000d\u000a      perceived cultural extremity; iii) the development of a process of\u000d\u000a      translation that engages the\u000d\u000a      academic as a practitioner in the rehearsal room. Two plays have been\u000d\u000a      developed using this\u000d\u000a      research: Babilonia, by Armando Disc&#233;polo and Las brutas \/\u000d\u000a        Beasts by Juan Radrig&#225;n, the latter\u000d\u000a      reaching a full professional production in 2011. The specific impact\u000d\u000a      described here relates to the\u000d\u000a      translation and performance of Latin American theatre through the\u000d\u000a      mobilisation of academic\u000d\u000a      research in theatre practice.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41270","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    a) Understanding and Challenging the Far-Right\u000a      The conclusions of the research described above have been integrated into\u000a      a variety of fora, and\u000a      have focused on two areas. Firstly, Wolfreys has raised public awareness\u000a      of how the success of\u000a      the contemporary extreme-right in France is the result of its\u000a      modernisation of a `classic' fascist\u000a      tradition. Secondly, and more specifically, his work and activity have led\u000a      to an enhanced\u000a      awareness of the importance of `unofficial' networks and grass roots\u000a      organizations in building\u000a      broad-based campaigns targeting the far-right with the aim of preventing\u000a      its entry into mainstream\u000a      politics. Thus, academic research on the history of fascism and of the\u000a      Front National, as well as\u000a      analyses of its contemporary form and of the responses to it in France and\u000a      across Europe, have\u000a      impacted on the political consciousness of individuals and groups actively\u000a      engaged in anti-fascist\u000a      and anti-racist politics.\u000a    The arguments developed and proposed in the publications listed above\u000a      have been presented at\u000a      various fora over the past decade and sought to influence not just debate\u000a      but also activity. In\u000a      particular, Wolfreys has written five prominent blog pieces analysing\u000a      contemporary political issues\u000a      for the Guardian Online (5.1). For example, in 2009 he wrote a piece\u000a      contributing to the extensive\u000a      media debate on Nick Griffin's appearance on Question Time with a\u000a      comparison of Le Pen and the\u000a      Front National's use of the media in France. This led to a discussion\u000a      among readers with 139\u000a      comments. And in 2010 Wolfreys' research on the FN fed into his Guardian\u000a      Online analysis of the\u000a      BNP's election manifesto, arguing that it exhibited an adaptation of\u000a      fascism to contemporary\u000a      conditions. The discussion that followed involved 383 comments. Other fora\u000a      where Wolfreys has\u000a      reached large audiences include an interview conducted with him by Adam\u000a      Boulton on Sky News\u000a      (3\/5\/12), which dealt with the French presidential election, the\u000a      relationship between mainstream\u000a      parties and the Front National and the consequences of making concessions\u000a      to racist arguments;\u000a      and an interview with Wolfreys on French radio (Europe 1, 18\/2\/13)\u000a      explaining why mobilisations\u000a      were taking place in Cambridge to contest the public platform given to\u000a      Marine Le Pen in February\u000a      2013 by the Cambridge Union (5.2)\u000a    As well as contributing to public debate and understanding, Wolfreys'\u000a      research has also informed\u000a      activists involved in debates and campaigns over denying political\u000a      legitimacy to the BNP\u000a      (particularly following its success in the 2009 European elections).\u000a      According to former Unite\u000a      Against Fascism press officer Anindya Bhattacharyya: `UAF campaigned with\u000a      the public and\u000a      lobbied journalists to persuade them that the BNP was an unrepentant\u000a      fascist group despite its\u000a      attempts to appear respectable. This culminated with a battle of opinion\u000a      over BNP leader Nick\u000a      Griffin's invitation onto the BBC's Question Time... Throughout this\u000a      period Jim Wolfreys's articles\u000a      and research provided useful ammunition for those of us arguing that the\u000a      BNP had not changed its\u000a      core politics and that it remained a fascist organisation with strong Nazi\u000a      sympathies. Jim's\u000a      comparisons with the Front National in France were particularly useful,\u000a      both in terms of explaining\u000a      the BNP's ruses and in terms of warning what might happen if they were\u000a      treated as a legitimate\u000a      populist organisation rather than as fascists and pariahs. Here is a\u000a      message we sent out on Twitter\u000a      at the time highlighting one of Jim's Guardian articles: the Guardian\u000a        has a must-read piece from\u000a        Jim Wolfreys re BNP on QT : Nick Griffin follows Le Pen's lead http:\/\/bit.ly\/1odzcw\u000a      #bbcqt.\u000a      In\u000a      summary I'd say Jim's research played an important role in helping\u000a      anti-racists win the argument\u000a      against the BNP at a crucial point when the fascists were on the cusp of\u000a      unprecedented\u000a      mainstream success. This kind of academic research plays an invaluable\u000a      role in complementing\u000a      and bolstering the work of campaigners and activists against racism and\u000a      fascism.' Wolfreys' work\u000a      also impacted on campaigners during the Barking election in 2010.\u000a      According to one of the\u000a      organisers of the 2010 mass canvassing campaign in Barking, where the BNP\u000a      held twelve council\u000a      seats and were hoping to elect Nick Griffin to parliament: `Jim's work\u000a      positively spurred our\u000a      campaign, by providing a clear and steadfast analysis of the rise of the\u000a      BNP locally. His\u000a      contributions filtered into conversations on the doorsteps, helping us to\u000a      invert the BNPs attempted\u000a      logic and reverse their historic and singular electoral victory' (5.7).\u000a      Wolfreys' arguments were also\u000a      used by the UAF on its website in calls for a demonstration against Marine\u000a      Le Pen's invitation to\u000a      the Cambridge Union in 2013 (5.3).\u000a    b) Unofficial Networks: the EAN\u000a    Wolfreys' research on neoliberalism and its critics has led to the\u000a      development of a threefold critique\u000a      of neoliberalism in relation to i) mainstream political parties; ii) new\u000a      managerialism in the workplace\u000a      and iii) the marketization of the public sector. His research on the role\u000a      of French social movements\u000a      in contesting this agenda, notably with regard to the role of unofficial\u000a      coordination committees in\u000a      supplementing the work of official labour movement organisations,\u000a      contributed to the formation and\u000a      development of the Education Activist Network (EAN) from 2009. This body,\u000a      established during a\u000a      400-strong conference at King's College London, became a national\u000a      organisation uniting students,\u000a      university staff and local communities in defence of public education.\u000a      Mark Bergfeld (NUS\u000a      Executive Officer 2010-12, EAN activist and a prominent figure in the\u000a      student demonstrations of\u000a      2010), describes the importance of Wolfreys' research in the development\u000a      of the EAN: `The\u000a      Education Activist Network is ... at one and the same time a social\u000a      movement and an organisation.\u000a      During the process of contestation and mobilisation (i.e. the 2010 UK\u000a      student movement, labour\u000a      disputes) it moved between these two poles stretching traditional notions\u000a      of \"organisation\" and\u000a      \"organising\". It drew on concepts of social movement unionism and\u000a      formulated a novel form of\u000a      organising. This makes it unique in today's British social movement\u000a      environment. Dr Jim Wolfreys\u000a      helped to develop this model of social movement organisation.' (5.8)\u000a    Between February 2009 and October 2012 EAN organised public meetings,\u000a      protests, conferences,\u000a      teach-ins and co-ordinations which involved several thousand people. EAN\u000a      fora were held in\u000a      scores of schools, FE colleges and universities. EAN was one of the\u000a      principal contacts for news\u000a      and comment pieces on the tuition fee debate, with subscribers to its\u000a      email list including The\u000a      Times, The Guardian, The Independent, The Financial Times, The Washington\u000a      Post, The Sun and\u000a      The Mirror, along with TV stations including BBC News, Channel 4, Sky News\u000a      and Al Jazeera.\u000a      Messages of support and requests for information were received from\u000a      hundreds of individuals\u000a      worldwide (5.4). At the grass-roots level, the EAN involved 12\u000a      decentralised local groups and also\u000a      30 affiiliate groups which included the National Union of Students. The\u000a      reach of the network is\u000a      shown by its email subscription list (over 7000 subscribers), its facebook\u000a      organising group (over\u000a      2500 members) and its twitter account (over 5000 followers; for social\u000a      media statistics, see\u000a      Bergfeld's statement, 5.8). EAN also produced a series of educational\u000a      materials, disseminated\u000a      through local groups and affiliated bodies, geared towards the elaboration\u000a      and dissemination of\u000a      practical tools for resisting neo-liberal ideas and policies in the public\u000a      sector, notably in the form of\u000a      the 2011 HE White Paper. Wolfreys' briefing on the White Paper,\u000a      `Universities for Hire', sold\u000a      between 2000 and 3000 copies, with orders and invitations to speak on it\u000a      received from dozens of\u000a      universities.\u000a    Bergfeld has described the importance of Wolfreys' research to the EAN:\u000a      `From the initial meetings\u000a      onwards, Dr Wolfreys drew upon his extensive academic knowledge of the\u000a      organisation of the\u000a      French public sector work stoppages against the Jupp&#233; government in 1995\u000a      and the anti-CPE\u000a      protests against precarity. This knowledge was an invaluable resource for\u000a      younger activists and\u000a      less experienced social movement participants [...] Dr Wolfreys acted as a\u000a      facilitator and helped to\u000a      oversee this new project from its formation onwards. His arguments and\u000a      insights allowed the\u000a      network to be maintained as open as possible without collapsing into a\u000a      traditional organisation. [...]\u000a      Wolfreys enabled the network to stand in its own right within social\u000a      movements and several labour\u000a      disputes at the time. The fact that a number of organisations such as the\u000a      Campaign for the Public\u000a      University and OUCHE! (Oxford University Campaign for Higher Education)\u000a      modelled themselves\u000a      on this example is further testimony to Wolfreys innovative and\u000a      intellectual quality.' (5.8)\u000a    Wolfreys' research in this area also impacted on the University and\u000a      College Union (UCU).\u000a      According to senior trade union official Michael MacNeil, UCU's National\u000a      Head of Higher\u000a      Education, `Between 2010 and 2012 there were major debates within the\u000a      University and College\u000a      Union about ... union policy in response to the Government's neo-liberal\u000a      reforms...The positions\u000a      adopted were the result of real tensions within the union and Dr.\u000a      Wolfreys' work, was influential on\u000a      significant groupings of activists and members within the University and\u000a      College Union. He was\u000a      instrumental in the development of the Education Activists' Network, which\u000a      seemed to exemplify a\u000a      practical application of his academic analysis.' (5.8)\u000a    Other fora where Wolfreys' research in this field reached a wide audience\u000a      include interviews with\u000a      Europe 1 (17\/11\/11), on the relationship between mobilisations in defence\u000a      of public education and\u000a      the strikes by public sector trade unions over pension reform, and with\u000a      French radio station France\u000a      Culture (30\/11\/10, 4\/5\/11) on the relationship between students and\u000a      education workers and their\u000a      potential to unite in defence of universal access to higher education. The\u000a      latter interviews focused\u000a      specifically on Wolfreys' role as a researcher on social movements and\u000a      participant in them (5.6).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Wolfreys' research has had impact in areas of public discourse and civil\u000a      society.

Wolfreys\u000a      contributed the majority of material for the expanded and updated 2003\u000a      edition of The Politics of\u000a        Racism and France (3.6), with Peter Fysh contributing half the\u000a      chapters to the original 1999\u000a      edition. The book sets out the following arguments: 1) the French Front\u000a      National is the product of a\u000a      reshaping of the heritage of inter-war fascism to contemporary conditions\u000a      involving a recalibration\u000a      of core themes of fascist ideology and propaganda, notably a shift in\u000a      emphasis from racial to\u000a      cultural exclusion and the courting of electoral respectability in order\u000a      to attract a wide periphery to\u000a      the far-right, whose aim was to expand its own hard-core of fascist\u000a      activists. 2) the consensus view\u000a      among French commentators and historians, that the FN was a\u000a      `national-populist' form of muscular\u000a      conservatism, masked the threat posed by the organisation and obscured the\u000a      need for\u000a      mobilisations to isolate it and prevent it from operating in public space.\u000a      3) French Republican\u000a      attitudes to questions of race and ethnicity act as a barrier to the\u000a      creation of a united campaign\u000a      focused on opposition to the FN. Such campaigns would need to generalise\u000a      across Europe beyond\u000a      the electoral arena if the rise of the far-right is to be stemmed. 4) The\u000a      rise of social movements\u000a      hostile to neoliberalism from the mid-1990s was symptomatic of a crisis of\u000a      `official' politics and\u000a      heralded the emergence of `unofficial' networks as a potential challenge\u000a      to the established\u000a      mediating structures of mainstream politics and civil society.\u000a    This fourth element has formed part of the analytical core of several\u000a      other articles by Wolfreys (3.1,\u000a      3.4, 3.5). These identify neoliberal managerialism as a defining feature\u000a      of contemporary public life,\u000a      characterised, paradoxically, by a lack of positive affiliation to its\u000a      values. This opens up spaces for\u000a      contestation and heterodoxy. The steady erosion of active affiliation to\u000a      mainstream political\u000a      institutions implies that this contestation has more chance of success if\u000a      framed and shaped by\u000a      unofficial networks and grass-roots associations, working alongside\u000a      `official' bodies. The relative\u000a      success of anti-fascism in Britain, forging broad unity to isolate\u000a      far-right groups, is therefore\u000a      instructive with regard to France, where affiliation to Republican values\u000a      has inhibited mobilisations\u000a      uniting activist milieux with Muslim youth. Conversely, the experience of\u000a      unofficial coordination\u000a      committees in France, working in parallel to official structures, and the\u000a      subsequent establishment\u000a      of a national network of local committees (notably during the 2005 EU\u000a      referendum and 2006\u000a      protests against the `CPE' (the contrat premi&#232;re embauche,\u000a      instituting the casualization of youth\u000a      labour) grouping together trade unionists, members of grass roots\u000a      associations and political\u000a      activists from diverse organisations, provides a model of successful\u000a      `unofficial' mobilisation capable\u000a      of offering an alternative leadership to that provided by traditional\u000a      labour movement organisations.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41271","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The significance and timeliness of the research was quickly recognised,\u000d\u000a      as evidenced by Dr Brian\u000d\u000a      Klug's announcement, in a magisterial review article, that the concept of\u000d\u000a      Islamophobia has `come\u000d\u000a      of age' [5.1].

One MCB activist\u000d\u000a      commented on the\u000d\u000a      importance of Vakil's initiatives in `building a better understanding\u000d\u000a      across disciplines and silos with\u000d\u000a      a focus on problem solving rather than just issue raising' [5.2].\u000d\u000a      Contributions to broad public activist\u000d\u000a      initiatives have included panel presentations and workshops at meetings\u000d\u000a      such as the `Confronting\u000d\u000a      Anti-Muslim Hatred in Britain and Europe' European Conference (London\u000d\u000a      Muslim Centre, 21 May\u000d\u000a      2011), and the `Celebrate Diversity, Defend Multiculturalism, Oppose\u000d\u000a      Islamophobia and Racism'\u000d\u000a      National Convention, organised by One Society Many Cultures and United\u000d\u000a      Against Fascism (15\u000d\u000a      October 2011) [5.4]. The corroborating statement from the MCB confirms\u000d\u000a      that, in his capacity as an\u000d\u000a      invited speaker at a variety of fora, Vakil `has made a direct\u000d\u000a      contribution to the emergence of a civil\u000d\u000a      society coalition including the trade unionists that is now confronting\u000d\u000a      Islamophobia in different\u000d\u000a      settings, from the shop floor to the senior common room.' [5.2]\u000d\u000a    The reconceptualisation of Islamophobia proposed in the book has also\u000d\u000a      informed Vakil's\u000d\u000a      participation and contributions to closed network and information exchange\u000d\u000a      meetings organised by\u000d\u000a      other civil society organisations. These include the October 2010 `End the\u000d\u000a      Isolation: Building\u000d\u000a      solidarity networks against Islamophobia in Europe', organised by the\u000d\u000a      Institute of Race Relations;\u000d\u000a      the `Far Right and the EDL, challenges for us all' round table at the\u000d\u000a      Muslim College London (31\u000d\u000a      May 2012), and post-Woolwich crisis meetings such as the London Muslims\u000d\u000a      Community Forum (12\u000d\u000a      June 2012), an advisory body for the London Metropolitan Police, and the\u000d\u000a      `Woolwich and Beyond:\u000d\u000a      Future Directions' Workshop convened by the Coventry University Centre for\u000d\u000a      Social Relations,\u000d\u000a      Faith Matters and the National Association of Muslim Police (London, 27\u000d\u000a      June).\u000d\u000a    In terms of political life and policy, the book's findings have reached\u000d\u000a      MPs particularly interested\u000d\u000a      in these issues, including at two Westminster initiatives to launch an All\u000d\u000a      Party Parliamentary Group\u000d\u000a      on Islamophobia; the first by the MCB, with the Muslim Safety Forum, the\u000d\u000a      Cordoba Foundation,\u000d\u000a      and the European Muslim Research Centre (3 March 2010), and the second by\u000d\u000a      Engage, at a\u000d\u000a      meeting hosted by Lord Mohammed Sheikh (12 October 2010) where Vakil spoke\u000d\u000a      as expert\u000d\u000a      witness. He is also cited in recent written evidence to the APPG [Allen,\u000d\u000a      2011 in 5.8].

In a Portuguese\u000d\u000a      context where Islamophobia is absent from anti-racist discourse, Vakil's\u000d\u000a      interview in the national\u000d\u000a      daily newspaper P&#250;blico, and his commentary on the 2009 European\u000d\u000a      Parliament meeting and\u000d\u000a      debate on Islamophobia, broke new ground by firmly positioning the\u000d\u000a      discussion of Islamophobia in\u000d\u000a      terms of racism and racialization [5.6]. Young professional audiences in\u000d\u000a      particular were reached\u000d\u000a      through a workshop on Islamophobia in August-September 2011 at the 2nd\u000d\u000a      United Nations\u000d\u000a      Alliance of Civilizations Summer School in Lisbon [5.7], involving recent\u000d\u000a      graduates from across the\u000d\u000a      Middle East and North Africa and Eastern Europe.\u000d\u000a    Vakil's University of Helsinki Public Lecture (`Dreams of Europe Without\u000d\u000a      Muslims') occasioned\u000d\u000a      two interviews on Islamophobia in the Finnish and Swedish press [5.6].

The first stage\u000d\u000a      in its development, informed by a comparison of the French and British\u000d\u000a      contexts, was a critical\u000d\u000a      review of the literature and debates on Islamophobia and the\u000d\u000a      identification of their conceptual\u000d\u000a      weaknesses, limitations and gaps [3.2]. The second stage was a research\u000d\u000a      Workshop convened by\u000d\u000a      Sayyid and Vakil at the University of Leeds in May 2008, where briefing\u000d\u000a      contributions by 12\u000d\u000a      researchers were debated in a day-long discussion involving some 20\u000d\u000a      academic and non-academic\u000d\u000a      participants (published as a CERS Working Paper in 2008 [3.2]). The third\u000d\u000a      stage,\u000d\u000a      following the selection of some of these papers, was the commissioning of\u000d\u000a      new essays for an\u000d\u000a      edited collection of 25 chapters by 28 authors published (in January 2011)\u000d\u000a      as Thinking Through\u000d\u000a        Islamophobia: Global Perspectives. Two prefatory and afterword\u000d\u000a      chapters by the editors concisely\u000d\u000a      set out the thrust of the volume's critical intervention [3.1].\u000d\u000a    Four fundamental approaches are advanced in the underpinning research as\u000d\u000a      concentrated in\u000d\u000a      this book and in subsequent interventions, for which the researcher's\u000d\u000a      comparative investigation of\u000d\u000a      the Muslim Question in the lusophone and Anglophone worlds has offered\u000d\u000a      original perspectives\u000d\u000a      and insights: an evaluation and critique of the term Islamophobia, with\u000d\u000a      reference to its history,\u000d\u000a      usage, limitations and potential; a broadly framed comparative\u000d\u000a      perspective, in disciplinary, legal,\u000d\u000a      policy and national terms; a global approach broadening the debate beyond\u000d\u000a      Western contexts\u000d\u000a      where most of the debate and analysis has been centred, and the inclusion\u000d\u000a      of Islamophobia in\u000d\u000a      Muslim majority contexts in particular; and a historicist approach\u000d\u000a      identifying Islamophobia as a\u000d\u000a      specifically postcolonial phenomenon. In particular, the research locates\u000d\u000a      Islamophobia in critical\u000d\u000a      racism studies, which shifts the terms of discussion of Muslims into\u000d\u000a      questions of politics,\u000d\u000a      racialization, rights and recognition.\u000d\u000a    A 2012 Workshop (Islamophobia@2012: Challenges &amp; Strategies, Vakil\u000d\u000a      and Laachir)\u000d\u000a      complemented the development of the underpinning research and its\u000d\u000a      dissemination with a\u000d\u000a      comprehensive multidimensional assessment of the current situation and\u000d\u000a      debates [5.9]\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41272","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In 1982, the film theorist Christian Metz famously conceptualized film\u000d\u000a      comment as a `third machine' of meaning production that functions\u000d\u000a      alongside industry and film text to structure cinema audience response.\u000d\u000a      Both Carter's current research (5.5), and the impact described here, draw\u000d\u000a      inspiration from Metz's understanding of the culturally generative\u000d\u000a      function of film commentary. Impact activities are thus designed to help\u000d\u000a      shape Anglophone discourse on, and reception contexts for, German-language\u000d\u000a      film. They build on Brady and Carter's shared core expertise in German\u000d\u000a      cinema studies, and on a keen commitment to public engagement that has\u000d\u000a      yielded, across a time-span of over two decades, extensive curatorial\u000d\u000a      work, film talks and exhibition programming at national and regional\u000d\u000a      venues including the Goethe-Institut (Brady x 4, 1991\/ 1998: Carter 1996),\u000d\u000a      the ICA (Carter, as ICA Talks Director 1986-8), Tate Gallery (Brady 1991),\u000d\u000a      National Film Theatre\/NFT (Carter 2006), BAFTA (Carter 2010) and Plymouth\u000d\u000a      and Warwick Arts Centres (Brady 1996; Carter 1995-2010).\u000d\u000a    During the assessment period, this shared expertise in public engagement\u000d\u000a      has provided the foundation for extended impact initiatives. Following\u000d\u000a      Brady's successful collaborations since 2008 with the British Film\u000d\u000a      Institute (BFI), the Cannes and London Film Festivals, Tate Modern,\u000d\u000a      Serpentine Gallery, and Goethe-Institut, Carter's 2011 appointment allowed\u000d\u000a      the UoA to consolidate impact activities around a joint project, the\u000d\u000a      German Screen Studies Network (GSSN). The backdrop is one of audience\u000d\u000a      underdevelopment. German-language productions garner under 0.1% of UK box\u000d\u000a      office, with successes largely limited to historical dramas or auteur\u000d\u000a      productions. Market research, however, registers audience growth in\u000d\u000a      contexts which foster relevant public discourse. 50% of respondents to a\u000d\u000a      2010\/11 UK-wide exhibitor survey name special cinema events as audience\u000d\u000a      magnets, and acknowledge the importance of media coverage, festivals,\u000d\u000a      symposia and talks in audience development (5.1-4). Academics who\u000d\u000a      participate in and shape such events thus not only fulfil the cultural\u000d\u000a      role described by Metz, but also have a market function in creating\u000d\u000a      reception infrastructures. Carter and Brady's efforts to fulfil that dual\u000d\u000a      function have taken the following three forms:\u000d\u000a    Impact 1:Translation and Interpreting as intercultural discourse\u000d\u000a        (Brady)\u000d\u000a      Brady's impact activities have long centred on translation, interpreting,\u000d\u000a      and public critical commentary as forms of intercultural mediation that\u000d\u000a      shape public discourse. His research focus on modernism has led him\u000d\u000a      repeatedly to anticipate the future promise of key modernist or\u000d\u000a      experimental cineastes, and to promote their work to initially sceptical\u000d\u000a      Anglophone audiences. During the assessment period, this work centred on\u000d\u000a      directors Michael Haneke, Ulrich Seidl and Alexander Kluge. Brady first\u000d\u000a      worked with Haneke on Benny's Video (1993). The film never\u000d\u000a      achieved national theatrical release, but Brady contributed to its public\u000d\u000a      recognition when he conducted a one-hour interview with Haneke for a 1993\u000d\u000a      ICA Video edition, which he also subtitled. Work on mediating Haneke's\u000d\u000a      work to UK audiences continued with further interviews, including a live\u000d\u000a      ICA event on Cinema and Violence to contextualize UK screenings of\u000d\u000a      Haneke's controversial Funny Games (1997). Brady's prominence, ten\u000d\u000a      years on, as a specialist advocate for Haneke was illustrated in the\u000d\u000a      assessment period when he translated live at Haneke's 2009 Guardian\u000d\u000a      Interview, as well as a BFI In Conversation event (www.bfi.org.uk\/live\/video\/153:\u000d\u000a      subtitles by Brady). He also translated on Haneke's 2009 White Ribbon\u000d\u000a      DVD and, following the 2012 release of the Academy Award-winning Amour,\u000d\u000a      contributed voice-over for a 2012 BBC Radio 4 Front Row interview with\u000d\u000a      Haneke which reached 802,000 listeners.\u000d\u000a    Further 2012 activities included Brady's live interpreting for Haneke for\u000d\u000a      the London Film Festival Gala Screening of Amour, and also at the\u000d\u000a      Cannes Festival, where Amour won the Palme d'Or. His\u000d\u000a      reputation as an expert interpreter, in the broadest sense, of Austrian\u000d\u000a      film has been further cemented by collaborations with auteur-director\u000a      Ulrich Seidl. Brady's position as Seidl's sole UK translator began in\u000d\u000a      1994, and culminated in 2013 with two events for which his participation\u000d\u000a      was explicitly solicited: a two-day Danish Film School seminar; and a\u000d\u000a      European Film College masterclass to which Seidl consented only \" provided\u000d\u000a      that [Dr Brady] will be able to translate&#187; (EFC email, 11.1013). The\u000d\u000a      grounds for Seidl's choice are illustrated by Brady's October 2011\u000d\u000a      appearance alongside directors Markus Schleinzer and Michael Glawogger at\u000d\u000a      a London Film Festival special panel event, `New Austrian Cinema.' The\u000d\u000a      event was the platform for a detailed extemporary analysis by Brady of\u000d\u000a      Anglo-Austrian film-cultural relations as the pertinent reception context\u000d\u000a      for work by Austrian practitioners including Schleinzer and Glawogger. It\u000d\u000a      features on the BFI website, and its 63 views by September 2013, alongside\u000d\u000a      671 views for the BFI:Live vodcast of Haneke's LFF interview, and 2844\u000d\u000a      views for BFI:Live's extract of Haneke's Guardian event, attest to the\u000d\u000a      continued significance and reach of Brady's mediating activities for\u000d\u000a      Austrian film.\u000d\u000a    An early response by Alexander Kluge to his collaboration with Brady\u000d\u000a      places those activities in the larger context of film audience\u000d\u000a      development. In 2006 and 2009, Brady was recruited by Serpentine Gallery\u000d\u000a      curator Hans Ulrich Obrist to translate films by Kluge in a live\u000d\u000a      performance in the director's presence. The 2009 event comprised short\u000d\u000a      films and lectures, as well as screened extracts from Kluge's News\u000d\u000a        from Ideological Antiquity: Marx-Eisenstein-Das Kapital. Kluge's\u000d\u000a      enthusiasm for this form of `expanded cinema' is evident from his comments\u000d\u000a      on the 2006 event : \" An overwhelming response from the London audience. A\u000d\u000a      direct public space. I myself was astonished at the intermedial\u000d\u000a      transposition. I had produced the films at different times for separate\u000d\u000a      broadcasts on TV... I had never seen them before with a live audience.\u000d\u000a      [...] That is alchemy. I now understood better what constitutes a film\u000d\u000a      programme. Also how film programmes in early cinema must have functioned.\u000d\u000a      [...] Without meeting places of this kind experience lacks self-awareness.\u000d\u000a      &#187; (5.7)\u000d\u000a    Impact 2:Developing research-based public understanding of German\u000d\u000a        cinema\u000d\u000a      Kluge's comments suggest an intriguing parallel between film in a live\u000d\u000a      performance with interpreter and director, and early cinema screenings\u000d\u000a      whose audience impact derived as much from the presence of live film\u000d\u000a      lecturers, as from the silent images on screen. The significance of\u000d\u000a      intercultural mediation in shaping film reception is further evident in\u000d\u000a      Brady and Carter's activities as curators and public critics. In this\u000d\u000a      impact cycle, research by Brady and Carter has led directly to their\u000d\u000a      recruitment as collaborators by arts and cultural institutions seeking\u000d\u000a      expert support in projects on German-language film. A 2013 BFI talk by\u000d\u000a      Carter on Herzog's sublime landscapes was prompted by her Herzog essay\u000d\u000a      (3.6), described in an email invitation as an `insightful and engaging'\u000d\u000a      discussion of Herzog's work (David Edgar, BFI Public Programmes Curator).\u000d\u000a      Brady's curatorial collaboration with the Goethe-Institut and Tate Modern\u000d\u000a      drew similarly on his long-standing research on political film, and on his\u000d\u000a      established reputation for informed public comment. His co-curated\u000d\u000a      November 2012 retrospective of films by the much-neglected documentarist\u000d\u000a      Peter Nestler (5.6 &amp; 5.11) is described in a corroborating statement\u000d\u000a      by the Goethe-Institut Film Officer as resting on a `long history' of\u000d\u000a      Goethe-Institut collaboration with Brady. She continues: `we have always\u000d\u000a      found that his introductions added an important element to our film\u000d\u000a      programmes and contributed to their appreciation by the audience.' Hence\u000d\u000a      the invitations to Brady to introduce four of the ten Tate and\u000d\u000a      Goethe-Institut screenings, as well as to publish an online Nestler\u000d\u000a      introduction in the art magazine Afterall. As the Goethe-Institut\u000d\u000a      further comments : `[This] comprehensive article on the work of Peter\u000d\u000a      Nestler, one of the first....published in English, has proven very useful\u000d\u000a      in drawing attention to our film season and its continuous online presence\u000d\u000a      ensures that valuable information about this filmmaker remains widely\u000d\u000a      available'.\u000d\u000a      (5.6).\u000d\u000a    Impact 3: Network-building &#8212; the German Screen Studies Network\u000d\u000a      Carter's arrival at King's has allowed the UoA to maximise its influence\u000d\u000a      as an opinion leader and reception platform for German-language film. The\u000d\u000a      key focus has been the German Screen Studies Network (GSSN), a forum for\u000d\u000a      informed comment and German-language film promotion amongst educators,\u000d\u000a      film professionals, and the interested public. The network, launched in\u000d\u000a      partnership with the Goethe-Institut, is currently financed by the German\u000d\u000a      Department and seven HEI partners. 2012-13 activities to build the network\u000d\u000a      included discussions with and\/or presentations to the Gesellschaft f&#252;r\u000d\u000a      Medienwissenschaft, Deutsches Institut f&#252;r Film, Goethe-Institut, Austrian\u000d\u000a      Cultural Forum, German Embassy, Oxford German Network, and the Leeds-based\u000d\u000a      German Film Learning Initiative (http:\/\/germanfilm.co.uk);\u000d\u000a      two postgraduate workshops; and website development (www.germanscreenstudies.co.uk).\u000a      Activities culminated in `The Return of the Real,' a three-month\u000d\u000a      Goethe-Institut film season, and a July 2013 symposium with 50 attendees\u000d\u000a      including cultural officials, industry practitioners, US\/UK academics,\u000d\u000a      students, and lay participants. Of the 38% of participants who returned\u000d\u000a      feedback questionnaires, 89% reported `enhanced' knowledge and\u000d\u000a      understanding as a result of the event; 79% were more likely to engage in\u000d\u000a      future with German-language film; and 68% offered help co-organising\u000d\u000a      future events (questionnaires available on request). According to the\u000d\u000a      Goethe-Institut: `From our point of view public screenings at the\u000d\u000a      Goethe-Institut with films from the Goethe-Institut Film Archive that\u000d\u000a      related to the symposium theme provided an ideal opportunity to place our\u000d\u000a      archive films into a specific context and to possibly find a wider\u000d\u000a      audience for them'. The German Embassy Deputy Head of Culture and\u000d\u000a      Education, Dr Susanne Frane, has pledged future support (email, 11.10.13);\u000d\u000a      and current discussions with the Goethe-Institut and network members on\u000d\u000a      follow-up events at Leeds (2014) and Cambridge (2015) confirm the GSSN's\u000d\u000a      success as a long-term, strategically focussed project to consolidate not\u000d\u000a      only Brady and Carter's impact activities, but German film-related\u000d\u000a      initiatives nationally, and in so doing, to build a sustainable `third\u000d\u000a      machine' for German-language film.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Deriving from Brady's research on modernist cinema, and Carter's on film\u000d\u000a      reception, the impact focuses on the development of UK reception contexts\u000d\u000a      for German-language film.

His research\u000d\u000a      on political modernism and recent work on contemporary German-language\u000d\u000a      film (3.4-5) have led to his recruitment as an expert commentator,\u000d\u000a      translator, interpreter and intercultural mediator in contexts including\u000d\u000a      the DVD editions, festival events, film talks, performances, and\u000d\u000a      curatorial and online publishing activities detailed in Section 4. These\u000d\u000a      activities are underpinned by research on Brechtian cinema and political\u000d\u000a      modernism, in particular on cinematic techniques of estrangement and\u000d\u000a      distanciation developed from Brecht's dramatic theory and practice\u000d\u000a      (3.2-3). Brady has written both on the philosophical issues underpinning\u000d\u000a      political modernist cinema &#8212; examples are his various essays on Walter\u000d\u000a      Benjamin, Theodor Adorno and film (e.g. 3.1) &#8212; and on the Brechtian roots\u000d\u000a      and context of German-language film. His 2010 monograph (3.5) explores how\u000d\u000a      collaborations between dramatist Peter Handke and cineaste Wim Wenders\u000d\u000a      prefigure the return to Brechtian aesthetics that occurred in the Young\u000d\u000a      and New German Cinema, and that still marks contemporary German-language\u000d\u000a      film. His collaborations with key contemporary auteurs including\u000d\u000a      Michael Haneke, Peter Nestler, Ulrich Seidl and Alexander Kluge are\u000d\u000a      grounded in ongoing research on the Brechtian roots and context of\u000d\u000a      contemporary film (3.2 and 3.3). His collaboration with filmmaker and\u000d\u000a      media theorist Kluge is further rooted in research on Kluge's extensive\u000d\u000a      engagement in his film practice with Frankfurt School cultural theorists,\u000d\u000a      including Adorno (3.1), and in Brady's (co-)translation of numerous books\u000d\u000a      and articles by Kluge, including Cinema Stories (2007), and the\u000d\u000a      forthcoming History and Obstinacy.\u000d\u000a    The UoA's commitment to research on German cinema was consolidated with\u000d\u000a      the appointment of Erica Carter as Professor in 2011. Her arrival expanded\u000d\u000a      the range of the UoA's German-language film expertise to include an\u000d\u000a      emphasis on audience and critical reception. Carter's article on Werner\u000d\u000a      Herzog and the sublime (3.6: written and published after 2011), forms part\u000d\u000a      of an ongoing project on reception aesthetics and audience. Research on\u000d\u000a      reception began with Carter's 2004 monograph Dietrich's Ghosts. The\u000d\u000a        Sublime and the Beautiful in Third Reich Film, and continues with\u000d\u000a      forthcoming articles on the poetics of film criticism (Screen 2014,\u000d\u000a      Hagener 2014). Her commitment to the practice as well as the theory of\u000d\u000a      audience formation is concretized both in her UK impact activities with\u000d\u000a      Brady, and in her research collaborations with film institutions in\u000d\u000a      Germany, including the Deutsches Institut f&#252;r Film\/Deutsches\u000d\u000a        Filmmuseum, Frankfurt-am-Main (in 2013, she co-organised a\u000d\u000a      postgraduate spring school with Filmmuseum curator Andrea Haller,\u000d\u000a      who is also contributing an article to the forthcoming second edition of\u000d\u000a      Carter et al.'s BFI German Cinema Book); and Cinegraph\u000d\u000a      Hamburg, for whom Carter has served as jury member for the\u000d\u000a      Willy-Haas-Preis, awarded annually for the year's best publications and\u000d\u000a      DVD editions on German film history.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41273","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As Assistant Director of the Poetry Translation Centre, Boll had seen\u000a      that arts organizations often choose to translate poets because of\u000a      personal friendships or a deference to foreign governments' promotion of\u000a      an official national literature. His commitment to translation criteria\u000a      based instead on a research-led understanding of the poets' significance\u000a      and potential to engage British audiences provided the foundation for a\u000a      successful application to Arts Council England (ACE) for a Grant for the\u000a      Arts worth &#163;41,000 (2009). He applied both his research and previous\u000a      experience at the Poetry Translation Centre to the presentation of Bracho\u000a      and Huerta to the UK public.\u000a    Boll had earlier represented the Centre on Respond in Practice, a\u000a      flagship scheme organized by ACE dedicated to audience development. For\u000a      the Mexican Poets' Tour, the Centre used that experience to create a\u000a      programme of events that would appeal to a variety of audiences: the\u000a      general poetry-reading public (Manchester, Grasmere, Glasgow, Edinburgh\u000a      and the PEN Free the Word Festival in London); specialist opinion-formers\u000a      (the London Book Fair, the universities of Oxford and Leeds); and Spanish\u000a      speakers living in England (the Cervantes Institute and a `meet the poets'\u000a      community event in London). The poets read to 500 people (5.1). Boll\u000a      presented the poets at the London Book Fair, Manchester, Leeds and\u000a      Edinburgh, and participated in Q&amp;A sessions, leading discussion on the\u000a      translation process.\u000a    Readings also targeted regional audiences whose exposure to foreign\u000a      literature events has traditionally been restricted. Local collaborating\u000a      organizations were enthusiastic about the impact of the tour on their own\u000a      programmes: `The Poetry Translation Centre does wonderful work in enabling\u000a      us to bring international poets to Grasmere who we otherwise wouldn't be\u000a      able to hear' (Literature Officer, Wordsworth Trust) (5.1); `Wonderful\u000a      opportunity to hear these voices and have the regional \"offer\" of poetry\u000a      and readings so vibrantly expanded' (Audience member, Chetham's Library\u000a      Manchester) (5.1); `We were delighted by the audience engagement in this\u000a      event &#8212; most people seemed to linger afterwards for the chance to chat to\u000a      the poets. Such events emphasise the Scottish Poetry Library's\u000a      international outlook and serious intent to widen the kinds of poetry\u000a      experience available to our audience' (Director, Scottish Poetry Library)\u000a      (5.3).\u000a    Audience responses indicate that the primary aim of the tour, to foster\u000a      public engagement with a foreign culture, was achieved: `The translated\u000a      poems are truly a bridge between cultures' (Audience member, Cervantes\u000a      Institute London) (5.1); `Enjoyable, inspiring and necessary for British\u000a      audiences to hear Mexican\/Isthmus Zapotec poetry. A wonderful event'\u000a      (Audience member, Exeter College Oxford) (5.1).\u000a    The events were supplemented by a permanent digital record which is\u000a      freely available on the PTC's website. Visitors to the site can download\u000a      print-on-demand versions of the chapbooks, read the poems in three\u000a      different versions (Spanish, literal and poetic English translation), view\u000a      videos of the events and listen to podcasts of the poets reading and\u000a      discussing their work (5.2). Between 1st March and 31st May 2010 the\u000a      website pages featuring the tour poets received approximately 7,500 unique\u000a      pageviews (5.1). The Chief Executive of Writers' Centre Norwich was asked\u000a      to assess David Huerta's podcast and chapbook for ACE: `One gets immediate\u000a      access to the poet's voice and presence &#8212; often the most powerful aspects\u000a      of readings when one cannot access the original language. I thought this\u000a      was an excellent piece of work that made the best use of the technologies\u000a      available to bring new work into the mainstream' (5.1).\u000a    The Tour aimed to provide not only an experience of a foreign culture but\u000a      also an understanding of the ways it relates to domestic traditions. Boll\u000a      employed his research knowledge to provide explanatory material that\u000a      accompanied the translations. He wrote a digital essay for the PTC\u000a      website, which placed the stylistic and thematic preoccupations of Bracho\u000a      and Huerta in the context of recent Mexican history (5.2). He also\u000a      produced introductions to the bilingual chapbooks of their work which the\u000a      PTC published to coincide with the tour. In addition, radio interviews\u000a      with David Huerta on BBC Radio 3's Night Waves, the World Service's The\u000a      Strand, Radio Netherlands Worldwide and Deutsche Welle Radio provided not\u000a      only publicity but an important contextualization of the poetry (5.1).\u000a    Comments on the PTC website reveal that the material appeals to a variety\u000a      of users. Secondary-school students have left appreciative comments: `it\u000a      was a really nice poem im doin a poem project and im choosin this to be\u000a      one of my three favorite poems` (Bracho, `Water of Jellyfish') (5.2): `I\u000a      Liked It How U Explained It And How U Used Some Spanish This Will Help\u000a      With My Topic!!!!' (Huerta, `Aural') (5.2). It has also stimulated a\u000a      creative response, including further translation activity: `One of the\u000a      poets in the audience who writes in Shetlandic has tried her hand at\u000a      translating one of Coral Bracho's poems' (Director, Scottish Poetry\u000a      Library) (5.3); `This is such a beautiful poem. I recently took a\u000a      photograph that I am now convinced was made to accompany this poem. I've\u000a      featured them together on my blog' (Bracho, `Thread in a Spider's Web')\u000a      (5.2).\u000a    Some of the more extensive comments articulate both enthusiasm and a\u000a      reflective engagement with the translations. One reader writes\u000a      appreciatively about the perceptual disorientation of Bracho's `Water of\u000a      Jellyfish': `Each word makes each of my senses dance-and at the same time!\u000a      So I'm not sure if I'm tasting, seeing, hearing or feeling. My senses are\u000a      at their confused best but what a delightful state to be in' (5.2).\u000a      Another reflects further on Bracho's capacity to present a world which is\u000a      conceptualized as much as experienced: `This is a poet of immense visual\u000a      and tactile imagination. We never hear, smell or taste the water, but what\u000a      a feast for our eyes and skin sense of water in all its shifting shapes,\u000a      moods and colors, its settings and its inhabitants' (5.2). Such responses\u000a      bear out Boll's concern with the philosophical aspect of the poets' work,\u000a      identified in his research as the key innovation and challenge for\u000a      English-speaking audiences.\u000a    Besides this direct impact on readers, Boll's promotion of Bracho and\u000a      Huerta has also led to a wider recognition of their work in established\u000a      outlets for English poetry publication. Translations of Huerta have\u000a      appeared in Modern Poetry in Translation 3, 12 (2009) and Poetry Review\u000a      100, 2 (2010); and Bracho has been published by Enitharmon Press (2008)\u000a      and Poetry Review 95, 3 (2005) and 100, 1 (2010) (5.4).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study demonstrates how translation has fostered engagement\u000a      between contemporary Latin American poetry and British audiences using the\u000a      agency of arts organizations, public events and the media.

The Mexican Poets' Tour drew on insights from two projects\u000a      during this period: research for his monograph, Octavio Paz and T.S.\u000a      Eliot: Modern Poetry and the Translation of Influence (Legenda, 2012)\u000a      (3.1); and archival research on the translation of Spanish American poetry\u000a      by Penguin Books. This research informed three aspects of the tour: the\u000a      selection of poets; the process of translation; and the presentation of\u000a      the poets' work to live and digital audiences.\u000a    The work on Boll's monograph during this period focused on a comparative\u000a      analysis of Eliot's Anglo-American and Mexican reception. This\u000a      investigation into the divergences between Mexican and Anglo-American\u000a      modernism established both the challenges and new perspectives that\u000a      Mexican poetry can offer to English readers. Anglo-American criticism has\u000a      habitually stressed Eliot's hostility to romanticism, downplaying the\u000a      philosophical reflection on language that is a key characteristic of the\u000a      European avant-garde. Eliot's Mexican reception, however, reveals a poetic\u000a      tradition that embraces the explicitly philosophical concerns of the\u000a      romantics, symbolists and surrealists.\u000a    Coral Bracho and David Huerta were selected to participate in the Mexican\u000a      Poets' Tour as outstanding recent examples of this tradition. They both\u000a      appeared in the definitive anthology of Latin American neo-baroque poetry,\u000a      Medusario (M&#233;xico: Fondo de Cultura Econ&#243;mica, 1996). Their work combines\u000a      the densely metaphorical practice of the baroque with reflection on\u000a      language, perception and selfhood inspired by the new French critical\u000a      theory. Although this theoretical context is familiar in British\u000a      universities, it has not filtered through to mainstream British poetic\u000a      practice, which remains mistrustful of a Continental, explicitly\u000a      philosophical tradition. The Poet's Tour would therefore introduce British\u000a      audiences to recent Mexican poetic innovation while challenging the\u000a      domestic culture.\u000a    Boll had invited Coral Bracho to participate in an earlier Poetry\u000a      Translation Centre Tour. The initial translations that he produced in\u000a      collaboration with the English poet Katherine Pierpoint revealed the\u000a      pressure that domestic norms exert on the translation process. In an\u000a      article that was published shortly before he began at King's, `Abstract\u000a      and Concrete: Translating Coral Bracho' (3.4), he enumerates the\u000a      resistances of English poetic practice to the Spanish American\u000a      neo-baroque.\u000a    In subsequent articles produced at King's on the translation of C&#233;sar\u000a      Vallejo and Pablo Neruda (3.2 and 3.3), Boll reflects more extensively on\u000a      different translation methods and the philosophical basis of divergent\u000a      attitudes to metaphor in the Latin and Anglo-American avant-garde. This\u000a      research informed a change of approach when he produced further\u000a      translations of Bracho and David Huerta for the Mexican Poets' Tour of\u000a      2010. Boll was able to intervene in his collaboration with Pierpoint and\u000a      Jamie McKendrick, identifying the presence of domestic norms in their\u000a      early drafts: a fear of conceptual abstraction, a tendency to attenuate\u000a      metaphor and the erasure of purposefully erudite registers in favour of\u000a      more accessible colloquial language. He explained and negotiated these\u000a      points of contention throughout the translation process, directing the\u000a      poets beyond their first choices to a more culturally informed recognition\u000a      of the Spanish texts.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42280","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has resulted in significant changes in professional\u000a      education and training of clinical psychologists. The results of the\u000a      research have been incorporated by the University of Social Sciences\u000a        and Humanities, Warsaw into the training programme for\u000a      specialisation in clinical psychology for clinicians in the Lower Silesia\u000a      region of Poland (equivalent of the English programmes training for the\u000a      Doctorate in Clinical Psychology). Modules focusing on exploring\u000a      experiences of mental illness, insight, interview techniques and\u000a      note-taking were introduced. The assumptions behind the research have also\u000a      informed the latest recruitment strategy for new candidates for the\u000a      programme. Considerably more weight was given to assessment of candidates\u000a      focusing upon the narrated experiences of their patients. The reach of\u000a      these changes is very significant - approximately 20% of all specialists\u000a      in clinical psychology in Poland are now trained within the Programme.\u000a    The research has also been disseminated to professionals (psychologists\u000a      and psychiatrists) as lectures and workshops in a number of venues in\u000a      Poland, and most particularly:\u000a    \u000a      Psychiatric Clinical Hospital of the Wroclaw Medical University\u000a        (October, 2009)\u000a      Polish Psychiatric Association (October, 2009)\u000a      General Psychiatric Hospital, Lubliniec (April, 2009).\u000a    \u000a    The research has also been used by the NHSBT Consent Workshop (chaired by\u000a      Emma Winstanley, National Referral Centre Manager, NHSBT, Speke), tasked\u000a      with reviewing the consent process in terms of language, deceased donor\u000a      family requirements and legislation. This resulted in improving the\u000a      process of obtaining consent for organ and tissue donation in the United\u000a      Kingdom. In particular, the impact consists in the panel's adoption of\u000a      wide-ranging recommendations as to the language of consent documentation\u000a      and leaflets. The recommendations were aimed at explicating and changing\u000a      the discursive `structure of faith' behind the documentation to be used by\u000a      the NHSBT. Most recommendations were adopted by the panel, directly\u000a      impacting upon the form of the consent forms and leaflets for the bereaved\u000a      families. Apart from this immediate impact, this activity is expected to\u000a      have a long-term impact upon the level and quality of information received\u000a      by the families being asked to give consent for retrieval of their\u000a      relatives' organs and tissues, and in the process of the care for those\u000a      involved in giving consent for organ and tissue retrieval.\u000a    The influence of these changes is far-reaching. 7,500 people are waiting\u000a      for a transplant in the United Kingdom (1,000 die as a result of not\u000a      receiving a transplant every year). Approximately 3,500 people die in\u000a      circumstances where they can donate.

It focuses on:\u000a    \u000a      the discursively constructed experience of mental illness (depression,\u000a        ICD10: F31-32, and schizophrenia, ICD10: F20; Galasinski 2008 &amp;\u000a        2010, respectively),\u000a      the therapeutic process and other professional practices (Galasinski,\u000a        2008, 2011; Galasinski &amp; Kozlowska, 2010, 2012)\u000a      professional practice (Galasinski, 2012; Galasinski &amp; Opalinski,\u000a        2012)\u000a    \u000a    At its most general, this research shows that discourse analysis (and its\u000a      critical strand, CDA), with its anchoring in a lexico-grammatical analysis\u000a      of the data, can give clinicians a firmer empirical basis for their\u000a      professional judgement. By providing insight into the linguistic form,\u000a      CDA's microanalysis is based on phenomena (such as passive voice or\u000a      nominalisation) which are independent of those who observe, analyse and\u000a      interpret them. In such a way, qualitative discourse analytic research can\u000a      help clinicians in understanding the complexities of the experience of\u000a      mental illness; enhancing their sensitivity to the linguistic form of\u000a      their patients' stories promotes deeper reflection thereon. Moreover,\u000a      discourse analysis can offer more sophisticated answers to the questions\u000a      of what it means to be a patient, to be mentally ill, to be in psychiatric\u000a      care, and, in the process, it can build on a sound empirical basis to\u000a      change and improve the care received by the most vulnerable. In the same\u000a      way, examination of the discursive mechanisms underpinning the therapeutic\u000a      process offers a better understanding thereof, which leads to its\u000a      improvement.\u000a    The research flagged up a number of hitherto unexplored issues in the\u000a      study of the discourses of mental health care. More specifically, it:\u000a    a. questioned the relevance of the so-called `depressed mood' in the\u000a      clinical presentation of the depressive episode in men, adding\u000a      empirically-based support to the calls for differentiating diagnostic\u000a      criteria for depression for men and women;\u000a    b. suggested discursiveness (with the consequences of its performativity\u000a      and anchorage in the local narrative context) of insight into\u000a      schizophrenia;\u000a    c. showed a very weak `lived' understanding of clinical significance (a\u000a      crucial concept in psychiatric diagnosis) amongst psychiatrists;\u000a    d. demonstrated significant weaknesses in psychometric testing, offering\u000a      evidence both for poor understanding of a major test of gauging severity\u000a      of depressive symptoms (the Beck Depression Inventory), and showing the\u000a      negotiative nature of the discursive position of the questionnaire\u000a      respondent;\u000a    e. showed a significant hiatus between how psychiatrists understand\u000a      insight and the body of research into it.\u000a    The second and much newer avenue of the research focused upon in this\u000a      case study is an analysis of narrated experiences of bereaved families\u000a      refusing consent for transplantation of their deceased relatives' organs\u000a      (Sque &amp; Galasinski, 2013). This is the first text-orientated discourse\u000a      analytic study of the transplantation experience. This research showed the\u000a      importance of the insights offered by discourse analytic microanalysis in\u000a      understanding the experience of transplantation. It produced results that\u000a      were novel and potentially ground-breaking in the social science of\u000a      transplantation medicine.\u000a    More specifically, the research offered a new understanding of the\u000a      decision process involved in the refusal of organ and tissue donation.\u000a      While the literature before the study assumed that families followed the\u000a      wishes of their deceased relatives, and, later, that the refusal was based\u000a      on the family's wish to keep their relative's body intact, the study\u000a      questioned these assumptions. The analysis of the families' narratives\u000a      showed that in fact those who take the decision are far more concerned\u000a      with their own feelings about and perceptions of organ retrieval.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42281","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aHermes Traducciones y Servicios Ling&#252;&#237;sticos, SL, established in 1991, is a leading translation\u000d\u000acompany with 100% Spanish capital, specialising in software and hardware localisation and also\u000d\u000aundertaking a broad range of other translation projects.

It is therefore clear that reducing the cost of the post-editing practice is a priority for them.\u000d\u000aNLP Technologies Inc (NLPT) is a Canadian company specialised in NLP that offers accurate and\u000d\u000areliable certified translation services and technologies by employing Computer Aided Translation\u000d\u000a(CAT).

In the past,\u000d\u000aHermes and NLPT would optimise their translation workflows, including their domain adaptation\u000d\u000astrategies, towards semi-automatic metrics of translation evaluation such as HTER (an edit\u000d\u000adistance between a cheaply obtainable draft translation and its human post-edited version).\u000d\u000aHowever there is no guarantee that HTER and other state-of-the-art metrics correlate well with the\u000d\u000areal effort spent on post-editing as they are only an estimate of the real edits made.\u000d\u000aIn 2012 Hermes achieved a 31% reduction in post-editing, whilst 2013 saw a 34% reduction. This\u000d\u000awas accomplished by combining two uses of PET as follows:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aoptimising domain adaptation strategies towards a combination of post-editing time and edit\u000d\u000adistances (accurately measured editing time is one of the original outcomes of PET);\u000d\u000acollecting data from the post-editing practice (PET's novel detailed effort indicators) that\u000d\u000aallowed them to learn an \"aptitude profile\" of their post-editors to the different types of texts\u000d\u000a(e.g. legal documents, movie subtitles, etc.). Such profiles were consulted before tasks\u000d\u000awere assigned so that the human subjects involved in a task were chosen depending on\u000d\u000atheir aptitude for that task.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aIn a similar experiment that took place in the last quarter of 2011, NLPT used PET to assess their\u000d\u000aown domain adaptation in order to maximise their own efficiency. They report a study in which four\u000d\u000aprofessional post-editors worked on documents translated using different domain adaptation\u000d\u000astrategies. PET allowed them to objectively tune their strategies towards time savings in a\u000d\u000acontrolled experiment. They have found that an average of 66 seconds could be saved per\u000d\u000asentence (for over 78% of the cases) if their models were optimised towards editing time as\u000d\u000aopposed to HTER. These savings can be extrapolated to future tasks compatible with the domains\u000d\u000aanalysed by matching their goal (time savings) with their evaluation methodology in a short and\u000d\u000anon-expensive analysis using PET.\u000d\u000aThe PET tool has also had an impact in education. In 2012-2013 DTIC introduced post-editing as\u000d\u000apart of their Master's programme and they chose PET due to its unique effort indicators as well as\u000d\u000aits flexibility in dealing with both human translation and post-editing. In their practical sessions,\u000d\u000astudents participate collectively in experiments aiming at contrasting human translation and post-\u000d\u000aediting in terms of (i) quality, (ii) productivity, and (iii) typically encountered errors. While students\u000d\u000aare introduced to state-of-the-art translation and post-editing practices, they are also assessed in\u000d\u000aterms of (a) how thoroughly they apply guidelines, (b) the quality they achieve, (c) their own\u000d\u000aproductivity, and (d) the errors they identify. PET's effort indicators, explicit assessments and\u000d\u000ahistory of edits are used for both purposes, namely, teaching (i-iii) and assessment (a-d).\u000d\u000aSince 2012, thanks to PET, DTIC's Master's students have been learning about and experimenting\u000d\u000awith post-editing, a practice that is of increasing importance in the translation industry and which is\u000d\u000abecoming indispensable to any modern translation professional.

Post-editing cost is a function of word count\u000d\u000aand editing time; that is, the longer it takes, the more it costs.\u000d\u000aRGCL developed PET [2], a stand-alone tool that allows the post-editing of output from any MT\u000d\u000asystem and records the following information at the segment level: post-editing time, customisable\u000d\u000aquality scores, time-stamped events, keystrokes, and the edit distance between the original MT\u000d\u000aoutput and the revised version. The collection of this type of information has been largely neglected\u000d\u000aby other editing tools and enables the assessment of translation quality, diagnosis of translation\u000d\u000aproblems, and estimation of the cost (and remuneration) of post-editing services.\u000d\u000aPET can also be used to set fine-grained constraints on a post-editing task, such as limits on the\u000d\u000atime allowed for editing or on the character\/word length of the final document (relevant for subtitling\u000d\u000a[1], for instance). Independent of any specific MT system, PET makes it possible to collect post-\u000d\u000aediting\/revision information in a controlled way for multiple MT\/TM systems. PET was first\u000d\u000aselectively released under non-disclosure terms in 2011 by Aziz and Specia, and is under continual\u000d\u000adevelopment. On the 27th of July 2012 the tool was publicly released under LGPL and by\u000d\u000aNovember 2013 there were 281 registered downloads (35% from industry) and 2,124 visits to its\u000d\u000amain page (67.85% new visitors) according to Google Analytics. The tool has also been listed by\u000d\u000aTAUS Tracker, a free directory for MT, TM and language technology tools. To date, the original\u000d\u000apaper describing PET has received at least 21 citations according to Google Scholar.\u000d\u000aRGCL then proposed the use of post-editing time as an objective quality discriminator [1].\u000d\u000aThe assumption is that good-quality MT should require little time to be post-edited. That is well\u000d\u000aaligned to the notion of productivity and how MT is used in practical\/commercial scenarios.\u000d\u000aMoreover, in 2011, RGCL successfully proposed the optimisation of quality predictors towards\u000d\u000apost-editing time, as opposed to traditional subjective human scoring [5] and, for our findings, we\u000d\u000aearned the best paper award at EAMT-2011.\u000d\u000aMeasuring post-editing time may not be sufficient due to the variation in competence and cognitive\u000d\u000aabilities of different translators. For this reason, since 2011, RGCL has investigated ways in which\u000d\u000atime- and edit-based effort indicators gathered by PET can be used for the purpose of assessing\u000d\u000aand predicting translation quality and productivity [3, 4].\u000d\u000aIn previous research, only rudimentary efforts have been made to explore possible effort indicators,\u000d\u000athese usually being restricted to automatic edit distances that i) do not reflect the real edits\u000d\u000aperformed by users, and ii) do not consider the necessary time and underlying cognitive effort\u000d\u000anecessary to perform the task.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"42282","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dickie's research on the history of criminal organisations in Italy has\u000a      had direct impacts on the training and practice of law enforcement and\u000a      judicial professionals, and of civil society organisations in Italy. The\u000a      work has also directly engaged wide public audiences both beyond and\u000a      within Italy, both through its publication in accessible texts bought and\u000a      read by a global non-specialist readership, and through its contribution\u000a      to international media discourse about Italian mafia and the social and\u000a      political implications of their operations.\u000a    Since the mafias are distinguished from ordinary gangs by their\u000a      historical continuity, understanding this history and how the\u000a      organisations have changed &#8212; or not &#8212; is a prerequisite for successful\u000a      anti-mafia work. The most powerful mafia in Italy today, the `ndrangheta,\u000a      remains under-researched: for example, before Dickie's work, there was no\u000a      adequate explanation of its origins. Moreover, since 1992, both Italy's\u000a      police forces and its prosecutors have been organised in specialised\u000a      anti-mafia teams, coordinated nationally. This new level of specialisation\u000a      means that, unlike the past, it is now a regular occurrence for both\u000a      police and magistrates to work on combatting different mafias in different\u000a      phases of their careers, and to work on several mafias contemporaneously.\u000a      Dickie's comparative research on mafia history provides a single\u000a      historical narrative of all the mafias together that is adequate to this\u000a      new, broader perspective.\u000a    The use of Dickie's research as a resource for practitioners has\u000a      ensured the considerable impacts of the research on professional\u000a        understanding and practice among anti-mafia officials in Italy.\u000a      However, the nature of Italian law enforcement, particularly in anti-mafia\u000a      work, is such that much of this influence occurs through informal channels\u000a      such as meetings, emails and telephone calls. The most dedicated\u000a      magistrates and law enforcement officers take it upon themselves to read\u000a      around the subject. Accordingly, law enforcement officials and judicial\u000a      practitioners routinely refer either to Dickie himself and\/or to the\u000a      written outputs of his research in seeking to better understand these\u000a      organisations' operation and evolution. As such, the research has made\u000a      significant contributions to the professional preparation and development\u000a      of law enforcement officers engaged in front-line work against the mafias.\u000a      The unique comparative approach used by Dickie to contextualise and\u000a      understand Italy's three principal mafia organisations sets his work apart\u000a      from comparable books, ensuring its widespread use at all levels of the\u000a      Italian law enforcement and judiciary services [1, 2].\u000a    This use of research has supported the successful investigation and\u000a        prosecutions of mafia members through its use to establish\u000a      correlations between contemporary investigations and the history of mafia\u000a      activities. Describing its general utility in this context, a magistrate\u000a      involved in anti-mafia investigations, and with experience investigating\u000a      both Sicilian and Calabrian organised crime, explains that: `[Dickie's]\u000a      research has confirmed empirical data that has emerged from investigations\u000a      I have carried out in Calabria' [1]. A Captain in the Carabinieri's ROS\u000a      section (which specialises in organised crime and terrorism) with\u000a      experience of front-line operations against both Cosa Nostra and the\u000a      `ndrangheta similarly attests to his use of Dickie's work `to confirm\u000a      dates or people involved in particular crimes' [2].\u000a    A specific example of this occurred in 2010 by magistrates in Reggio\u000a        Calabria to build a case by prosecuting the `ndrangheta as a whole under\u000a        Italian mafia laws as part of `Operation Crimine', a national police\u000a      operation that led to the arrest of some 300 suspected members. The\u000a      assumption that the Calabrian mafia constituted only a loose collection of\u000a      local gangs had previously meant that each `ndrangheta trial had to start\u000a      from scratch by proving the existence of the particular local gang in\u000a      question. This was a serious impediment to effective law enforcement.\u000a      Operation Crimine sought to remedy this by providing the first evidence of\u000a      the existence of a coordinating body known as the Crimine (the Crime).\u000a      Dickie used both Mafia Brotherhoods and supplementary\u000a      documentation communicated personally to the Assistant Chief Prosecutor of\u000a      Reggio Calabria to demonstrate that the Crimine (or something very like\u000a      it) may already have existed in the 1930s and is perhaps even as old as\u000a      the `ndrangheta itself. This information was used, in the prosecutor's\u000a      words, `to analyse the results of [police and judicial] investigations and\u000a      to construct hypotheses based on that evidence which, particularly in\u000a      relation to the complex project known as Crimine, have so far met with\u000a      substantial confirmation in the rulings issued by a number of Italian\u000a      judges in trials that have taken place in both Milan and Reggio Calabria'\u000a      [3]. The trials resulting from Operation Crimine are still ongoing. Once\u000a      the judicial process is complete, it is hoped that they will establish a\u000a      precedent for recognising the `ndrangheta as a single, unified criminal\u000a      association, allowing for collective prosecution under Italy's 1982\u000a      anti-mafia law no. 416bis - a huge step forward that will parallel that\u000a      achieved by the famous maxi-trial against Cosa Nostra in 1992.\u000a    Dickie's expert research insights are widely and frequently used to inform\u000a        understanding and practice within anti-mafia civil society organisations.\u000a      These include the Sicilian organisation Addiopizzo, which takes a\u000a      revolutionary approach to fighting the mafia by bringing together\u000a      businesses that refuse to pay protection money to Cosa Nostra with\u000a      consumers who want to make sure that the money they spend does not end in\u000a      the mafia's coffers. The organisation's officers and volunteers use\u000a      Dickie's work to better understand the history and operation of the mafias\u000a      and thereby to enhance the services that they provide to both local\u000a        communities and tourists. Addiopizzo Travel, for example, requires\u000a      all of its trainees to read Cosa Nostra as preparation for\u000a      delivery of organised tours of Palermo's `sites of memory' in relation to\u000a      the mafia and the city's fight against it [4]. Dickie's books have also\u000a      promoted Addiopizzo's work and objectives among a wider public audience:\u000a      many non-Sicilian tourists have been introduced to Addiopizzo by reading Cosa\u000a        Nostra in its various translations, and have become involved in its\u000a      efforts as a result, including, for instance, by donating money and\u000a      choosing hotels that do not pay protection. Addiopizzo uses Cosa\u000a        Nostra to introduce young Sicilians to the history of the Mafia\u000a      including, for example, a three-year project (2008 to 2010) sponsored by\u000a      the Ministry of Education, in which Addiopizzo worked with secondary\u000a      school students to research the history of the mafia in an effort to\u000a      reduce its influence on day-to-day Sicilian society [4].\u000a    The reach of the books' impacts on public engagement with and\u000a        understanding of mafias is considerably enhanced by the fact that Cosa\u000a        Nostra, Mafia Brotherhoods and Mafia Republic are\u000a      written for non-specialist audiences, presenting both original and\u000a      established research to a global audience in an accessible while still\u000a      academically rigorous manner. As a Financial Times article (June\u000a      2011) described the narrative of Mafia Brotherhoods, it `bowls\u000a      along, powered by the sort of muscular prose one associates with great\u000a      detective fiction' [5].\u000a    The books' reach across international public readerships is suggested by\u000a      the number of translations and sales. This is particularly so for Cosa\u000a        Nostra, which has appeared in 21 languages plus Braille since\u000a      publication in 2004; by Spring 2011 it had sold 750,000 copies worldwide.\u000a      The book's yearly English language sales (excluding the US market) from\u000a      2008 to 2011 exceeded 60,000, with sales peaking in 2008 (16,371) and 2011\u000a      (16,465) [6]. The book's continued relevance to broad non-academic\u000a      audiences is further demonstrated by renewed contracts for continued\u000a      publication in countries including Holland, Spain, Norway, and Germany;\u000a      and sales and translations have flourished in new markets such as Finland,\u000a      China, Poland. Mafia Brotherhoods has likewise been widely\u000a      translated into Dutch (2011), Italian (2012), Czech (2012), and Chinese\u000a      (2013) and sold over 39,000 copies since 2011. Mafia Republic,\u000a      published in the UK in May 2013, is already contracted for publication in\u000a      the same territories. While contracts to produce single volumes combining\u000a      the two books had been signed in Germany and the US [6]. Cosa Nostra's\u000a      reach, moreover, extended well beyond casual readers: in June 2008, a\u000a      filmed raid on a Russian mob boss's palatial villa in Rome found the book\u000a      on his bedside table!\u000a    However, the most significant channel for the broader impacts of the\u000a      research on public engagement with the issues covered in Dickie's books is\u000a      their coverage by media outlets around the world. Mafia Brotherhoods\u000a      was subject to extensive media coverage surrounding its publication in\u000a      2011, ensuring the communication of its key insights to a huge audience,\u000a      including interviews on BBC Radio 5 Live's Up All Night (6m\u000a      listeners per week) and Newstalk 106-108 FM (12% audience share in\u000a      Dublin); and a major July 2011 book tour in Australia &#8212; where the\u000a      `ndrangheta has long had a presence &#8212; including appearances on Late Night\u000a      Live with Philip Adams (over 300k listeners) [7]. As recently as 2012, Cosa\u000a        Nostra was the book club selection by the influential American\u000a      pundit David Frum on the hugely popular Daily Beast website which receives\u000a      18 million visitors per month. [8]\u000a    Dickie's provision of expert advice to media professionals through\u000a      informal consultations and organised events has also informed and\u000a        enhanced media professionals' knowledge about &#8212; and thereby the accuracy\u000a        of global media discourse on &#8212; mafias, which are often reported in\u000a      sensationalist terms. Dickie's books frequently inform coverage of mafia\u000a      stories by providing relevant historical and societal information. This is\u000a      gleaned not only from use of the published work, but also through Dickie's\u000a      presentations to media professionals of expert insights gained through his\u000a      research. On 2 September 2009, for example, he drew on research later\u000a      published in Mafia Brotherhoods and Mafia Republic to\u000a      deliver an invited presentation on mafias and the media to some 150 news\u000a      professionals at the annual conference of the European Broadcasting\u000a      Union's radio news group in Turin. Media interest in his work recently\u000a      extended to the production of two related television documentaries based\u000a      on it: the first of these, Mafia Bunker, was transmitted on\u000a      History Channel Italia in April 2013; the second, The Mafia's Secret\u000a        Bunkers, aired on BBC2 on 1 May 2013. The latter, according to its\u000a      Executive Producer, used Dickie's research not only as a credible source\u000a      of support for the original commission, but to move `beyond an engaging\u000a      current affairs piece into the most detailed and informative piece on the\u000a      `Ndrangheta Mafia in Calabria that there has been on international\u000a      television' [9]. It was watched by 1.23 million (5.27% audience share) and\u000a      was recommended by the Telegraph, Daily Mail, the Times,\u000a      Observer and the Sun. The Italian version pulled in 114,000\u000a      viewers, doubling History Channel Italia's average audience, and also\u000a      received positive advance notices in the Italian press [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at UCL spread public understanding of mafias around the world,\u000a      contributed to the professional preparation and development of law\u000a      enforcement officers and investigating magistrates engaged in front-line\u000a      work against the mafias, provided historical evidence supporting\u000a      magistrates in Reggio Calabria seeking to create a legal precedent for the\u000a      successful prosecution of the `ndrangheta under anti-mafia laws.

The three\u000a      major mafias &#8212; the well-known Cosa Nostra mafia of Sicily; `ndrangheta, a\u000a      Calabrian mafia organisation believed to control a large proportion of the\u000a      European Union's drug traffic who, in recent decades, have surpassed their\u000a      better-known Sicilian counterparts in spread and earnings; and the\u000a      camorra, their Neapolitan counterparts &#8212; constitute a major threat to\u000a      Italy's stability and democracy. Understanding these organisations\u000a      inevitably has implications far beyond academia.\u000a    John Dickie (full-time researcher in UCL Italian since 1993; Professor of\u000a      Italian Studies since 2009) has been researching these mafias in Sicily\u000a      and Southern Italy since 2001, focusing particularly on examining their\u000a      history and organisation as a means of better understanding how they have\u000a      prospered for so long. His more recent (post-2007) work in this area is\u000a      underpinned by an innovative comparative approach to the long history of\u000a      the three mafias, and draws on documentation unearthed by him on important\u000a      phases of their history. It particularly explores a new `unitary' approach\u000a      to the `ndrangheta's history, which had long been believed to be a\u000a      collection of gangs rather than an organised group. As with all\u000a      `large-canvas' narrative history, Dickie's approach involves blending\u000a      existing work with new research, often drawing on newly discovered sources\u000a      to provide overarching narrative syntheses intended to be accessible to\u000a      specialist and non-specialist academic, as well as to professionals and\u000a      the general public.\u000a    His 2004 monograph, Cosa Nostra [a, section 3], exemplifies this\u000a      approach in its synthesis of the best academic work then extant in the new\u000a      sub-discipline of Sicilian mafia history with recent insights from the\u000a      judiciary, law enforcement and journalists, and localised areas of fresh\u000a      research. Dickie drew on these myriad sources to produce an academic\u000a      consensus around the history and evolution of the Sicilian mafia and to\u000a      bring this specialist understanding to as wide an audience as possible.\u000a    Work undertaken between 2007 and 2013 and supported by a Leverhulme\u000a      fellowship (2009-11) led to the publication in 2011 and 2013 respectively\u000a      of Mafia Brotherhoods [c] and Mafia Republic [d], a\u000a      two-volume history of organised crime in Italy, from its origins to the\u000a      present day. Inasmuch as they draw on existing research, these texts seek\u000a      to reproduce for the other major criminal organisations (the camorra of\u000a      Campania and Naples, and the `ndrangheta of Calabria) what Cosa Nostra\u000a      does for the Sicilian mafia. However they rely much more heavily than did\u000a      Cosa Nostra on first-hand research of archival and other sources.\u000a      Dickie's comparative methodology allowed him to set out new theses in\u000a      these texts on, among other things: the origins of the `ndrangheta; the\u000a      transformation of its relationship to kinship groups; the persistence of\u000a      coordination between its local cells; and the likely existence in the\u000a      distant past of a coordinating body, known today as the Crime or Great\u000a      Crime, and which has only just been discovered by law enforcement. The\u000a      work particularly challenged a previous perception of the Calabrian mafia\u000a      as a loose collection of local gangs.\u000a    A short biography based on newly discovered sources of Ermanno Sangiorgi,\u000a      a nineteenth-century police chief involved in mafia operations also\u000a      emerged from this research project [b].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42554","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research at UCL Scandinavian Studies has provided a means by which Nordic\u000d\u000a      cultural organisations can mediate their works to UK audiences and has\u000d\u000a      created an environment in which new modes of mediation can develop. This\u000d\u000a      is achieved both through organised events attracting diverse London\u000d\u000a      audiences, and by developing new channels through which partnerships are\u000d\u000a      strengthened with a range of collaborators, such as embassies, publishing\u000d\u000a      houses, translator networks and theatre companies. This activity has been\u000d\u000a      facilitated through the application of Thomson's and Stougaard-Nielsen's\u000d\u000a      research expertise in digital technology and medium-specificity to the\u000d\u000a      development of multi-platform publishing and cultural mediation.\u000d\u000a    Working with the London embassies of Denmark and Sweden and Nordic\u000d\u000a      cultural institutions such as the Danish Agency for Culture, our research\u000d\u000a      enhances public awareness of Scandinavian cultural heritage and\u000d\u000a        produces new cultural resources. We are regularly called upon by\u000d\u000a      such institutions to collaborate on developing effective and innovative\u000d\u000a      modes of engaging UK audiences with the aspects of Scandinavian culture\u000d\u000a      they wish to promote, and we often lead on the design and delivery of such\u000d\u000a      activities through multiple channels which, during the impact period,\u000d\u000a      included exhibitions and talks, theatre collaborations, translation and\u000d\u000a      publication of important literary works, and the development of networks\u000d\u000a      of translators, illustrators and publishers who benefit from our research\u000d\u000a      insights in mediating these works to Anglophone audiences. Our research\u000d\u000a      combines expertise in `classic' Scandinavian literature and cinema with\u000d\u000a      new insights into the cultural and technological contexts in which they\u000d\u000a      emerged: we thus assist cultural institutions to re-interpret and mediate\u000d\u000a      Scandinavian cultural capital for British audiences in ways which speak to\u000d\u000a      contemporary interests and media consumption practices.\u000d\u000a    A recent and major example of this collaboration &#8212; in this case with the\u000d\u000a      Embassy of Sweden in London &#8212; was the exhibition and event series Strindberg's\u000d\u000a        Red Room at UCL [1-3]. This exhibition was commissioned and funded\u000d\u000a      entirely by the Embassy of Sweden in London, which provided total funds of\u000d\u000a      c. &#163;5000. It took place in UCL's North Lodge exhibition space from 22\u000d\u000a      September to 22 October 2012, and featured 22 events as well as a core\u000d\u000a      exhibition including materials provided by the Swedish Institute and the\u000d\u000a      Nordic Museum in Stockholm. Curated by Thomson, this exhibition provided\u000d\u000a      an introduction to the life and work of August Strindberg to mark the\u000d\u000a      centenary of his death, but was characterised by a concern, rooted in\u000d\u000a      Thomson's research, with Strindberg's creative output across media, genres\u000d\u000a      and fields (e.g. plays, photography, painting, science essays). Visitors\u000d\u000a      thus benefited from an enhanced knowledge and understanding of the\u000d\u000a      significance and range of Strindberg's oeuvre, but could also hear\u000d\u000a      presentations (e.g. one based on Stougaard-Nielsen's research on Hans\u000d\u000a      Christian Andersen [c]), engage in discussion, and be exposed to artefacts\u000d\u000a      and images on related topics such as the production of scientific\u000d\u000a      knowledge, the role of chance in art, and nineteenth-century photographic\u000d\u000a      experimentation. In addition to some 230 visitors in situ, the Red Room\u000d\u000a      website had by 31.7.2013 attracted 6500 page views from 61 countries [1].\u000d\u000a      Visitor comments [2] included: `impressive and inspirational exhibit';\u000d\u000a      `enlightening and thought-provoking'; `very stimulating'. Another element\u000d\u000a      in this commission was a special issue of the magazine Swedish Book\u000d\u000a        Review [4] (including an essay by Thomson on Strindberg's\u000d\u000a      photographic experiments [f]), published by Norvik Press and distributed\u000d\u000a      to 380 subscribers. The Swedish Embassy confirms [3] that Strindberg's\u000d\u000a        Red Room at UCL achieved two key goals: the centenary was marked in\u000d\u000a      the UK in an innovative multidisciplinary academic frame, and in physical\u000d\u000a      settings which brought Strindberg to audiences beyond the Embassy's\u000d\u000a      established contacts.\u000d\u000a    The application of our research to enhancing public awareness and\u000d\u000a      enjoyment of cultural heritage also extends to more straightforward forms\u000d\u000a      of mediation. Thomson's introduction to a screening of Vinterberg's Festen\u000d\u000a      at London's Nordic Film Festival 2012 at Riverside Studios, attended by 68\u000d\u000a      people, drew directly on her monograph [d] and was positively reviewed in\u000d\u000a      Kettle Magazine [5]. Her Bright Club podcast on Nordic cinema\u000d\u000a      including Dogme 95 was downloaded 1114 times (Feb 2011-Jan 2012). She also\u000d\u000a      wrote and performed two research-based comedy sets on Danish film for\u000d\u000a      Bright Club, UCL's academic comedy night, at Bright Club LIFE (4.2.2011,\u000d\u000a      audience of 554, set and interview filmed by BBC [6]), and at Bright Club\u000d\u000a      READING (9.5.2013, audience of 230) [7].\u000d\u000a    Our research has catalysed changes to existing businesses which has,\u000d\u000a        in turn, benefited our cultural partners. Central to this endeavour\u000d\u000a      has been the relocation to UCL in 2010 of a specialist Scandinavian\u000d\u000a      publishing house, Norvik Press, first established at the University of\u000d\u000a      East Anglia in the 1980s. Leveraging the support structures provided by\u000d\u000a      UCL Advances and UCL Enterprise, more commonly used by STEM researchers\u000d\u000a      commercialising discoveries, Thomson, as a Director of Norvik Press, has\u000d\u000a      worked to create synergies between emerging print technologies, the\u000d\u000a      department's collective expertise in Scandinavian culture, and its public\u000d\u000a      engagement activities, in order to develop modes of mediating Scandinavian\u000d\u000a      literature that are sustainable, cost-effective, inflected by research,\u000d\u000a      and sensitive to readers' attachment to books as attractive material\u000d\u000a      objects.\u000d\u000a    In 2010-11, Thomson was appointed a UCL Knowledge Transfer Champion (KTC)\u000d\u000a      to apply her research insights on digital technology and\u000d\u000a      medium-specificity to the development of multi-platform publishing. This\u000d\u000a      KTC award funded a research assistant post (held by Marita Fraser) to\u000d\u000a      provide the necessary expertise in production technology. Thomson also\u000d\u000a      worked with UCL Advances to broker the appointment of Norwegian literature\u000d\u000a      specialist Elettra Carbone as a Knowledge Exchange Associate seconded to\u000d\u000a      Norvik Press to manage and evaluate the transition to digital\u000d\u000a      print-on-demand (PoD) technology as Norvik's mode of production and\u000d\u000a      distribution. PoD obviates the need for expensive storage of back stock\u000d\u000a      and streamlines the ordering process. This had a critical impact on\u000d\u000a      Norvik's dissemination of Nordic literature: sixteen books, including\u000d\u000a      several key projects in collaboration with Nordic institutions, were\u000d\u000a      published as PoD in the period 2011-13.\u000d\u000a    An important example is the translation series `Lagerl&#246;f in English',\u000d\u000a      edited by Helena Fors&#229;s-Scott (researcher at UCL, retired 2010). Five\u000d\u000a      volumes in the series have so far been published via PoD, all classic\u000d\u000a      Swedish works that would not otherwise be in print in English. Building on\u000d\u000a      the department's research emphasis on books as intermedial objects, this\u000d\u000a      series also provided a framework to promote Swedish artists in the UK: the\u000d\u000a      Embassy brokered a competition to design book covers for the series, in\u000d\u000a      partnership with Beckmans College of Design, Stockholm. This provided UK\u000d\u000a      exposure for the winner, Sture Pallarp. Similarly, illustrations for a new\u000d\u000a      translation of the two-volume children's classic Nils Holgersson's\u000d\u000a        Wonderful Journey (trans. Peter Graves, Norvik Press, 2013) were\u000d\u000a      selected via open call. The selected artist, Bea Bonafini, benefited not\u000d\u000a      only financially from use of her images but also in terms of artistic\u000d\u000a      development, as evinced by her essay (included in the book [8]) discussing\u000d\u000a      her conceptual engagement with the translated text. The cultural impact of\u000d\u000a      the availability of this novel by Selma Lagerl&#246;f, the first female Nobel\u000d\u000a      Laureate in Literature, was powerfully expressed by critic Paul Binding in\u000d\u000a      his TLS review: \"my own life is unimaginable without Nils\u000d\u000a      Holgersson\" [9]. The synergies between UCL's public engagement activity\u000d\u000a      and Norvik Press are further exemplified by Norvik's use of the Strindberg\u000d\u000a      exhibition as an environment in which to re-launch and contextualise Peter\u000d\u000a      Graves' translation of the Strindberg novel The Red Room (first\u000d\u000a      published in 2009; 645 copies sold to date) [4]. These, and similar\u000d\u000a      projects, have enabled Nordic cultural organisations to ensure that UK\u000d\u000a      readers have access to significant works of Nordic fiction through an\u000d\u000a      established and sustainable channel whose publication strategies are\u000d\u000a      informed by UCL's research in Scandinavian culture and book history.\u000d\u000a    A second, and related, example of our contribution to business\u000d\u000a      development is our ongoing collaboration with the semi-professional\u000d\u000a      theatre company Foreign Affairs. Our Strindberg centenary activities\u000d\u000a      included the publication by Norvik of a volume of 4 one-act plays by\u000d\u000a      Strindberg, an initiative designed with the Swedish Embassy and\u000d\u000a      coordinated under the auspices of our Impact Studentships (see below) to\u000d\u000a      provide opportunities for networking and skills development for\u000d\u000a      Swedish-English translators. Experienced translation mentors were assigned\u000d\u000a      to aspiring translators, who worked in pairs on the translations,\u000d\u000a      consulting Foreign Affairs on the performability of the resulting texts.\u000d\u000a      Two of these plays were then produced by Foreign Affairs, premiering on 19\u000d\u000a      October 2012 at the Bloomsbury Theatre Studio (2 performances, c. 60\u000d\u000a      attendees). This translation project thus expanded the young company's\u000d\u000a      repertoire with two new productions of Strindberg's lesser known plays.\u000d\u000a      This collaboration is acknowledged by the co-founder of Foreign Affairs,\u000d\u000a      Trine Garrett, as a watershed for the company, crystallising its focus on\u000d\u000a      translated material and artistic collaborations. Foreign Affairs' income\u000d\u000a      from the Strindberg productions funded the group's membership of the\u000d\u000a      Independent Theatre Council and its incorporation as a company [10].\u000d\u000a    That our contribution to the mediation of Nordic culture in the UK is\u000d\u000a      regarded by our partners as a sustainable and valuable exchange of\u000d\u000a        skills, knowledge and resources is evinced by significant financial\u000d\u000a        investment on their part, not only for specific events but also in\u000d\u000a      the form of scholarship funding. Three doctoral studentships have been\u000d\u000a      part-funded by Nordic cultural institutions under the UCL Impact PhD\u000d\u000a      Studentship scheme, which couples research with impact-generating\u000d\u000a      activities; this partnership scheme is otherwise predominantly used in\u000d\u000a      STEM research. In 2010, two PhD studentships in Swedish-English\u000d\u000a      translation were brokered by Thomson and the Swedish Embassy's Cultural\u000d\u000a      Counsellor, and co-funded by the Swedish Academy, the Barbro Osher Pro\u000d\u000a      Suecia Foundation, and Mr Stefan Olsson (a total of &#163;64,575) [3]. These\u000d\u000a      PhD projects draw on Thomson and Stougaard-Nielsen's research in print\u000d\u000a      culture, intermediality and cultural transfer. The projects have enhanced\u000d\u000a      the public's and cultural institutions' understanding of the agency of\u000d\u000a      translators and other actors in the translation, publication and promotion\u000d\u000a      of Swedish literature, and developed and sustained networks between\u000d\u000a      stakeholders in the UK and overseas, via such channels as the students'\u000d\u000a      contributions to Swedish Book Review, presentations on Radio\u000d\u000a      Wales, at the Gothenburg Book Fair, the British Centre for Literary\u000d\u000a      Translation Summer School, and at London events such as the Nordic Noir\u000d\u000a      Book Club and New Swedish Fiction Book Club, as well as the collaborative\u000d\u000a      drama translation project outlined above. A third Impact Studentship in\u000d\u000a      2013 demonstrates that this model is recognised as successful and\u000d\u000a      sustainable. With the intention of building on existing literature-focused\u000d\u000a      collaboration in London with the Danish Embassy, the Danish Arts Council's\u000d\u000a      Committee for Literature contributed &#163;32,353 in summer 2013 to co-fund an\u000d\u000a      Impact PhD studentship focusing on the role of social media in the\u000d\u000a      promotion of new Danish fiction in the UK [11], with the practical remit\u000d\u000a      of establishing a new network for Danish-English translators.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Working in close collaboration with a range of non-academic partners,\u000d\u000a      research insights into the connections between technological change and\u000d\u000a      narrative and visual culture inform the mediation of Scandinavian literary\u000d\u000a      and cinematic classics to UK and international audiences.

The research falls\u000d\u000a      into two inter-related categories.\u000d\u000a    First, several research publications have applied media-specific analysis\u000d\u000a      to literature and visual culture in innovative ways. This includes, but is\u000d\u000a      not restricted to, the study of works which self-consciously call\u000d\u000a      attention to their own material instantiation. This category includes\u000d\u000a      Claire Thomson's monograph [d] on the seminal Danish film Festen\u000d\u000a      (dir. Thomas Vinterberg, 1998), the first commercial feature film to be\u000d\u000a      shot on digital video, which was nonetheless transferred to and\u000d\u000a      distributed on 35mm analogue film. Thomson argues that the film employs\u000d\u000a      the conceptual and visual tension produced by this clash of media to\u000d\u000a      produce a new hybrid aesthetic fundamental to the film's emotional impact.\u000d\u000a      She also examines the aesthetically productive tension arising from\u000d\u000a      intermediality in her article on a 1942 Danish novel which reflects on its\u000d\u000a      own material instantiation in book form to construct an imagined national\u000d\u000a      community [e]. Thomson's analysis of August Strindberg's experimentation\u000d\u000a      with indexicality in his essays and his photography [f] examines the\u000d\u000a      engagement of a canonical nineteenth-century Scandinavian author with the\u000d\u000a      cutting-edge media of his day, as does Jakob Stougaard-Nielsen's work on\u000d\u000a      the intermedial influence of periodicals and scrapbooks in the narrative\u000d\u000a      form of H. C. Andersen's fairytales [c]. This research demonstrates how\u000d\u000a      materiality is part and parcel of textuality in our own age and in earlier\u000d\u000a      technological eras.\u000d\u000a    A second focus of the underpinning research is how technological shifts\u000d\u000a      affect the aesthetics, production and reception of visual and literary\u000d\u000a      texts. The current cultural and technological transition into the digital\u000d\u000a      age is important here: Thomson's monograph [d] examines the influence of\u000d\u000a      Dogme 95 on late twentieth-century filmmaking and its impact on popular\u000d\u000a      anxieties about digital technology. Stougaard-Nielsen's article for the\u000d\u000a      journal Kritik [a] explores the policies and practices entailed by\u000d\u000a      digital storage and mediation of collective memory and cultural heritage.\u000d\u000a      A ground-breaking and wide-ranging reconsideration of the relations\u000d\u000a      between publishing, technology, translation and Nordic literature is\u000d\u000a      provided by a substantial theme issue of the journal Scandinavica\u000d\u000a      [b], edited by Stougaard-Nielsen with Elettra Carbone, a UCL Teaching\u000d\u000a      Fellow.\u000d\u000a    The research described here was conducted by Claire Thomson (Lecturer\u000d\u000a      2007-2013, Senior Lecturer 2013-), and Jakob Stougaard-Nielsen (Lecturer\u000d\u000a      2010-2013, Senior Lecturer 2013-).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42775","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3042362","Name":"Guernsey"},{"GeoNamesId":"1899402","Name":"Cook Islands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2139685","Name":"New Caledonia"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Through her research into Guernesiais and wider approaches to endangered\u000d\u000a      language protection,\u000d\u000a      Sallabank has for many years been actively involved with officials and\u000d\u000a      endangered language\u000d\u000a      community members in Guernsey, providing advice and practical support to\u000d\u000a      their attempts to\u000d\u000a      revitalise this almost extinct language.\u000d\u000a    In 2009 and 2010, she led groups of SOAS MA students to Guernsey, working\u000d\u000a      with the Language\u000d\u000a      Officer, Yan Marquis, to `kick-start' documentation and raise awareness of\u000d\u000a      language shift; both\u000d\u000a      trips attracted considerable attention from local media. In 2012,\u000d\u000a      Sallabank was also the recipient of\u000d\u000a      a small grant from the British Academy for a project on the \"Development\u000d\u000a      of Electronic Language\u000d\u000a      Corpus and Pedagogical Support Materials: Guernsey, Channel Islands,\"\u000d\u000a      allowing her to continue\u000d\u000a      documenting Guernesiais, in association with Guernsey Museums Service and\u000d\u000a      Mr Marquis (now a\u000d\u000a      freelance researcher and teacher). As part of this research they are\u000d\u000a      collaborating to investigate the\u000d\u000a      needs and motivations of learners of Guernesiais; the findings will be\u000d\u000a      used to develop appropriate\u000d\u000a      learning materials. Often schools are the focus of revitalisation efforts,\u000d\u000a      but for many small\u000d\u000a      languages there are few fluent teachers or materials. Effective adult\u000d\u000a      language learning is thus a\u000d\u000a      vital step in re-establishing speaker communities. Research into this area\u000d\u000a      is of great significance\u000d\u000a      since standard models\/frameworks for teaching major languages are not\u000d\u000a      applicable.\u000d\u000a    Her research into language attitudes has both reflected and fostered\u000d\u000a      greater awareness of\u000d\u000a      language issues in the Channel Islands and elsewhere. As well as\u000d\u000a      interviewing government\u000d\u000a      officials, she has collaborated with NGOs such as L&#233; Comit&#233; d'la Culture\u000d\u000a      Guern&#233;siaise (an\u000d\u000a      umbrella body for language support groups) and La Soci&#233;t&#233; Guern&#233;siaise, a\u000d\u000a      scientific\/cultural\u000d\u000a      association (1 and 2, below). Data from her research is used by officials\u000d\u000a      in language planning and\u000d\u000a      she was commissioned to write a paper (based on her doctoral research) for\u000d\u000a      the Guernsey Ministry\u000d\u000a      of Culture and Leisure in 2007, whose recommendations were implemented in\u000d\u000a      the appointment of\u000d\u000a      a Language Officer. From 2007 to 2011 she advised the Language Office and\u000d\u000a      was a member of\u000d\u000a      the Language Advisory Panel.\u000d\u000a    Since early 2013, she has been advising the new Guernsey Language\u000d\u000a      Commission (GLC) on\u000d\u000a      language planning (3). In July 2013 Sallabank was invited to attend a\u000d\u000a      meeting with the GLC's\u000d\u000a      members; in the invitation email, it was stated that Sallabank's input was\u000d\u000a      requested based on the\u000d\u000a      need for `high level advice on strategy.' Sallabank's recommendations and\u000d\u000a      findings were\u000d\u000a      distributed to all members following the meeting. These included: a need\u000d\u000a      for collaboration at\u000d\u000a      strategic level; the lack of younger speakers is a major concern (she\u000d\u000a      knows of only 5-6 under 60,\u000d\u000a      the youngest aged 45), thus a core of proficient younger adult speakers\u000d\u000a      needs to be developed to\u000d\u000a      take the language into the future; she recommends a mentor system to go\u000d\u000a      with adult education;\u000d\u000a      and the development of integrated, usage-based materials &#8212; Sallabank is\u000d\u000a      currently compiling a\u000d\u000a      corpus of audio language samples to create a multimedia dictionary of\u000d\u000a      Guernesiais. Sallabank is\u000d\u000a      listed as a partner in the GLC's `Business Plan' with particular respect\u000d\u000a      to plans to research and\u000d\u000a      record the language, to raise awareness of it, and to develop effective\u000d\u000a      teaching of Guernesiais.\u000d\u000a      Sallabank's publications are also listed on the GLC website.\u000d\u000a    Sallabank is also in frequent contact with the Language Offices in the\u000d\u000a      Isle of Man and Jersey.\u000d\u000a      Research conducted on the teaching of Jersey's indigenous language,\u000d\u000a      J&#232;rriais, in 2012 was sent to\u000d\u000a      L'Office du J&#232;rriais in Jersey's Department for Sport, Language and\u000d\u000a      Culture (4). In their response,\u000d\u000a      the Office described her research as excellent and has invited Sallabank\u000d\u000a      to run a short course on\u000d\u000a      how J&#232;rriais lessons can be improved. Her research has been shared with\u000d\u000a      multiple people involved\u000d\u000a      in the preservation and promotion of J&#232;rriais throughout the island.\u000d\u000a    Sallabank's wider expertise on endangered languages more broadly has also\u000d\u000a      resulted in demand\u000d\u000a      for her expertise by organisations unrelated to the Channel Islands. In\u000d\u000a      June 2011 she was invited\u000d\u000a      to join a Panel of Experts on language diversity at UNESCO in Paris (5).\u000d\u000a      Additionally, on 7th Nov\u000d\u000a      2013, she addressed a ministerial meeting of the British-Irish Council\u000d\u000a      (intergovernmental agency\u000d\u000a      set up to further collaboration and best practice in regional affairs) on\u000d\u000a      legislation in support of small\u000d\u000a      languages.\u000d\u000a    Moreover, in March 2013, Sallabank visited New Caledonia to conduct\u000d\u000a      research into language\u000d\u000a      attitudes following an invitation to attend a meeting of L'Acad&#233;mie des\u000d\u000a      Langues Kanak (which\u000d\u000a      oversees language planning) (6). She is currently planning surveys into\u000d\u000a      language attitudes and\u000d\u000a      shift in New Caledonia and the Cook Islands, collaborating with local\u000d\u000a      researchers.\u000d\u000a    Finally, in 2010 Sallabank participated in BBC Radio 4's \"Word of Mouth\"\u000d\u000a      programme about\u000d\u000a      endangered languages (7), heard by a 6th-form pupil in the UK\u000d\u000a      who then researched Sallabank and\u000d\u000a      came across an interview with a BBC News report from 2010 (8).

Sallabank works closely with the island's endangered language\u000d\u000a      community and is\u000d\u000a      currently working on a British Academy-funded project into learning\u000d\u000a      Guernesiais with a local\u000d\u000a      collaborator, having previously held an Endangered Languages Documentation\u000d\u000a      Programme grant\u000d\u000a      to document Guernesiais. A Norman language strongly influenced by Norse\u000d\u000a      and English at\u000d\u000a      different points in its history, Guernesiais has just 6-7 proficient\u000d\u000a      speakers under age 60; under 2%\u000d\u000a      of Guernsey's population speaks Guernesiais fluently (2001 census).\u000d\u000a      Guernesiais does not have\u000d\u000a      official recognition or status, nor does it have an official name, often\u000d\u000a      being referred to as a dialect.\u000d\u000a      It is also rarely heard or written in the media. Sallabank's work is thus\u000d\u000a      concerned with how the\u000d\u000a      language might be revitalised, protected and preserved.\u000d\u000a    Sallabank has examined approaches to endangered language revitalisation\u000d\u000a      employed in other\u000d\u000a      contexts to determine whether they could be applicable to Guernsey.\u000d\u000a      Specifically, in output a,\u000d\u000a      Sallabank assessed the concept of `polynomic' languages, a pluralistic\u000d\u000a      language model with no\u000d\u000a      prescriptive standard and open to functional distinctions, which has been\u000d\u000a      employed in the teaching\u000d\u000a      of Corsican. Sallabank's research has shown that many in Guernsey view\u000d\u000a      regional variation of\u000d\u000a      Guernesiais as enriching for the language, suggesting therefore that the\u000d\u000a      polynomic approach could\u000d\u000a      be an appropriate model. Such an approach, however, is problematised by\u000d\u000a      the increasing trend\u000d\u000a      towards linguistic purism. Taking into account such challenges,\u000d\u000a      Sallabank's article compared the\u000d\u000a      language planning of Guernsey and Corsica to determine the feasibility of\u000d\u000a      the polynomic model of\u000d\u000a      language planning in the former.\u000d\u000a    Sallabank also investigated how changes in attitudes towards Guernesiais\u000d\u000a      among Guernsey\u000d\u000a      residents might result in increased measures to protect it. In output b,\u000d\u000a      Sallabank traces shifts in\u000d\u000a      language ideology in Guernsey from a monolingual ideal to the more recent\u000d\u000a      recognition of a\u000d\u000a      bi\/trilingual linguistic heritage. Sallabank examines to what extent this\u000d\u000a      shift has led to official\u000d\u000a      support and concrete language planning measures. Sallabank also compares\u000d\u000a      Guernesiais with\u000d\u000a      other Norman languages of the Channel Islands (output c), comparing the\u000d\u000a      success of their\u000d\u000a      respective revitalisation measures.\u000d\u000a    Sallabank's extensive research into the languages of the Channel Islands\u000d\u000a      has fed into her recently\u000d\u000a      published monograph, Attitudes to Endangered Languages: Identities and\u000d\u000a        Policies. Using a\u000d\u000a      combination of ethnographic research and quantitative surveys, the book\u000d\u000a      examines language\u000d\u000a      revitalisation efforts in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man, identifying\u000d\u000a      and confronting issues\u000d\u000a      frequently faced by practitioners and researchers working in these\u000d\u000a      communities. The book also\u000d\u000a      assesses the implications of ideologies, identity and language-related\u000d\u000a      beliefs and practices for\u000d\u000a      such revitalisation measures.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42791","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    ELAR was established through a &#163;20-million sponsorship of the Endangered\u000d\u000a      Languages Project by Arcadia in 2002. This enabled research and practice\u000d\u000a      in documentary linguistics to provide direct benefit to a range of users\u000d\u000a      through the various activities of the archive. ELAR is not only part of\u000d\u000a      the forefront project to document and support endangered languages\u000d\u000a      worldwide, but is also an acknowledged leader in applying new media\u000d\u000a      technologies in support of the goals of language documentation (1, below).\u000d\u000a    ELAR's catalogue serves an average of over 400 unique visitors per day\u000d\u000a      with 1.4 million page-views per year. ELAR has a registered membership of\u000d\u000a      1,040 people from 85 countries, with membership increasing by about 5% per\u000d\u000a      month (2, 3). Along with linguists, professional members include a number\u000d\u000a      of anthropologists, archivists, and language teachers. In addition, a\u000d\u000a      growing number of language and culture enthusiasts use the archive. A\u000d\u000a      prominent example is the well-known New York-based poet Bob Holman who has\u000d\u000a      used ELAR in 2012 and 2013 to create Lost Wor(l)ds: an Endangered\u000d\u000a        Cento, a collage poem in which each line reproduces a single line of\u000d\u000a      poetry from one of the world's endangered languages (4, 5).\u000d\u000a    Holman learned of ELAR as a visitor to \"Endangered Languages Week\" (ELW)\u000d\u000a      at SOAS. Initiated by ELAR and the Endangered Languages Academic Programme\u000d\u000a      in 2007, the annual week-long series of outreach events &#8212; which includes\u000d\u000a      demonstrations, talks, performances and films &#8212; attracts hundreds of\u000d\u000a      participants and audience members (6).\u000d\u000a    Of ELAR's membership, endangered language community members\u000d\u000a      comprise 10%; for ELAR, such engagement of members of endangered language\u000d\u000a      communities is vital, both as documenters of their own languages and as\u000d\u000a      users of the archive. Eli Timan, a native speaker of the highly endangered\u000d\u000a      and now globally dispersed Jewish Iraqi dialect of Arabic, provides an\u000d\u000a      excellent example (7). Jews lived in Baghdad for more than 2,500 years and\u000d\u000a      by the early 20th century they comprised one-third of the city's\u000d\u000a      population. Of 137,000 Jews in Iraq in the 1940s, 124,000 had fled by 1952\u000d\u000a      as victims of persecution following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. When Timan\u000d\u000a      began documenting his native language in 2005, it was virtually a language\u000d\u000a      of the diaspora alone, with only 10 Jews remaining in Baghdad. The last\u000d\u000a      seven Jews in Iraq were named by Wikileaks in 2011, applying further\u000d\u000a      pressure on them to flee.\u000d\u000a    Having learned of the Endangered Languages Project from a newspaper\u000d\u000a      article, Timan visited SOAS in 2005, motivated to preserve his spoken\u000d\u000a      language and create oral documentation of the recent history of Iraqi\u000d\u000a      Jews. He took early retirement from a career in accountancy to visit\u000d\u000a      diaspora communities in the UK, Canada and Israel to record his language\u000d\u000a      and culture. Having successfully applied for funding, Peter Austin, David\u000d\u000a      Nathan and others provided training in historical linguistics, phonetics,\u000d\u000a      phonology, morphology, language revival, database management, and the use\u000d\u000a      of recording equipment and linguistic documentation software.\u000d\u000a    Timan writes: \"My life has been transformed since then as I embarked on\u000d\u000a      my most important and interesting project.\" He has completed much of his\u000d\u000a      project, and has deposited 34 fully-documented stories and interviews in\u000d\u000a      the language with ELAR. He confirms the importance of this archived\u000d\u000a      material to his community and beyond:\u000d\u000a    \"Other members of the community have commented favourably on the material\u000d\u000a      I deposited. They do not see it as a language project, but rather as a\u000d\u000a      \"Living history project\". Recently there has been a great interest in\u000d\u000a      \"Iraqi Jews\" from fellow Muslim Iraqis challenging the taboos of 35 years\u000d\u000a      of Saddam's reign where nothing about us was allowed to be published as we\u000d\u000a      were branded \"Zionist spies\". It may be that the archive will prove more\u000d\u000a      valuable to those Iraqi Muslims anxious to discover a vital element of\u000d\u000a      Iraq past history.\"\u000d\u000a    Crucial to Timan is the knowledge that his work is properly archived at\u000d\u000a      ELAR and will remain accessible regardless of changes in technology. He\u000d\u000a      has deposited materials with other Jewish Iraqi centres in the diaspora,\u000d\u000a      but because they lack technical expertise, that work remains inaccessible.\u000d\u000a    Endangered language community members who wish to reconnect with and\u000d\u000a      learn more about the languages their parents and older family members\u000d\u000a      spoke are also users of the archive.

It takes advantage of developments in information, media and\u000d\u000a      communication technologies and is concerned with the theoretical,\u000d\u000a      methodological, technological and ethical frameworks for documentation,\u000d\u000a      preservation, support and dissemination of digital samples of endangered\u000d\u000a      languages and cultures. Documentary Linguistics also directly supports\u000d\u000a      endangered language speakers and communities by ensuring that outcomes are\u000d\u000a      useful for their language and heritage goals, through encouraging\u000d\u000a      collaboration, through respect for their rights in recorded materials, and\u000d\u000a      by providing managed access to materials that they consider private,\u000d\u000a      sacred or sensitive.\u000d\u000a    The development of the online Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR) at SOAS\u000d\u000a      occurred in parallel with the growth of Documentary Linguistics to which\u000d\u000a      Professor Peter Austin and David Nathan have contributed substantially.\u000d\u000a      The six publications listed below, dating from 2005, when ELAR was created\u000d\u000a      by them and their team, are representative of their many, often\u000d\u000a      foundational research outputs in the field, which treat both theoretical\u000d\u000a      and practical topics that have guided the development of ELAR.\u000d\u000a    Output a, for example, explores how language documentation materials can\u000d\u000a      be better described, discovered, and interpreted. Metadata records (which\u000d\u000a      categorise and describe electronic materials) when implemented in\u000d\u000a      traditional fixed, limited schemas are insufficient to provide the level\u000d\u000a      of contextualisation, understanding and access control needed for complex\u000d\u000a      and diverse materials. Austin and Nathan propose a broader approach to\u000d\u000a      metadata, enabling enhanced articulation of knowledge about the creation,\u000d\u000a      context and content of resources, to reflect the perspectives of various\u000d\u000a      participant and user groups, especially endangered language speakers. As a\u000d\u000a      result, ELAR supports a flexible, nuanced approach to metadata. Output f\u000d\u000a      extends this argumentation to apply to \"metadocumentation\" of the language\u000d\u000a      documentation process itself.\u000d\u000a    With the advent of Web 2.0 and social networking, Nathan investigated how\u000d\u000a      an archive can provide a platform for information-sharing relationships\u000d\u000a      between depositors, users, language speakers and others. ELAR implemented\u000d\u000a      such a platform in 2009. Output e of 2010 motivates and describes this\u000d\u000a      platform, proposing that social networking channels incorporated into ELAR\u000d\u000a      provide ways for users to access sensitive materials through negotiation\u000d\u000a      with depositors in conjunction with endangered language speakers.\u000d\u000a    Threaded through the underpinning research is the issue of access\u000d\u000a      protocol &#8212; the collection and implementation of information about\u000d\u000a      private\/sensitive materials, necessary because language documentation\u000d\u000a      typically consists of recordings of spontaneous private conversations. As\u000d\u000a      one of the emerging archives for language documentation, ELAR had to deal\u000d\u000a      with the sensitivities associated with the private, personal, sacred or\u000d\u000a      other sensitive content of many archived recordings. ELAR was the first\u000d\u000a      archive to research the needs for access management and to implement them\u000d\u000a      using contemporary social networking architecture. ELAR's innovative\u000d\u000a      platform allows depositors and users to negotiate directly about access as\u000d\u000a      well as to share information about the archived languages, thus redefining\u000d\u000a      the archive as a platform for information-based relationships between\u000d\u000a      information providers and users. ELAR's unique system of graduated and\u000d\u000a      negotiated access safeguards the rights of language speakers and also\u000d\u000a      opens new exchange channels between those providing, and those wishing to\u000d\u000a      access, materials (see ELAR's access protocol http:\/\/www.elar-archive.org\/using-elar\/access-protocol.php)\u000d\u000a    Other themes directly relevant to the design and development of ELAR in\u000d\u000a      the underpinning research include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      sustainability (ensuring long-term preservation and usability of\u000d\u000a        electronic resources);\u000d\u000a      maximising the quality of language documentation through informed\u000d\u000a        methodologies, enhanced skills, and understanding of equipment and\u000d\u000a        digital document technologies;\u000d\u000a      progress towards enhanced metadata and \"meta-documentation\",\u000d\u000a        especially related to the goals, history, processes, methods, dynamics\u000d\u000a        and structures of language documentation projects.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43362","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Three linked elements generate the impact of this project: the impact of\u000a      Marcus's films themselves, as he develops his techniques for exploring\u000a      time, place and trauma; the impact of his exploration of other filmmakers'\u000a      techniques through the interviews of The Director's Cut and the\u000a      archive that it creates for future researchers; and the impact of The\u000a        Director's Cut's associated events, particularly the public\u000a      masterclasses at Aberdeen's art cinema, The Belmont Picture House, and the\u000a      Junior Director's Cut competitions which encourage schoolchildren\u000a      to become involved in filmmaking.\u000a    The films of the In Time of Place project have led to over 40\u000a      invited talks, keynotes and public talks with audiences in the fields of\u000a      Architecture, Divinity, Film and Visual Culture, History, Jewish and\u000a      Holocaust Studies, Memory Studies and Philosophy, underscoring the\u000a      research project's interdisciplinary significance. Public screenings and\u000a      talks have included the Irish Film Institute in Dublin (2009), and public\u000a      lectures in Antigonish and St. John's, Nova Scotia (2010) in tandem with\u000a      Remembrance Day and the anniversary of Kristallnacht, and a screening and\u000a      talk for archivists at the Museum for the History of the Polish Jews in\u000a      Warsaw (2011). The Cemetery (2010) was selected for screening at\u000a      the largest annual documentary conference in 2013, VEXX in Stockholm, and\u000a      was followed by a discussion of its experimental ethnography that was\u000a      chaired by the VEXX conference director and involved leading documentary\u000a      theorists, including Bill Nichols (1991, 2001), Michael Renov (1993, 2004)\u000a      and Catherine Russell (1999), while The Memorial was the only UK\u000a      entry selected for screening at the largest annual international film\u000a      conference in 2012, organized by the Society for Cinema and Media Studies\u000a      in Boston.\u000a    The Director's Cut has attracted significant local attention, not\u000a      only in terms of the numbers regularly attending the events, but in terms\u000a      of its high profile in the local press. The Aberdeen Press and Journal,\u000a      for instance, in reporting on Nicolas Roeg's participation, stated: `film\u000a      fanatics gathered in their hundreds in Aberdeen last night for a special\u000a      presentation by a world leader in international cinema' (April 2008). Roeg\u000a      directed the landmark films, Walkabout, Don't Look Now and The\u000a        Man Who Fell to Earth. In covering The Director's Cut event\u000a      with Sir David Attenborough, the same newspaper recorded that, `a hugely\u000a      popular series of talks celebrating the art of the filmmaker reached a new\u000a      high yesterday as one of the world's most famous naturalists was welcomed\u000a      to the fold' (July 2008). The impact of the series can be measured in part\u000a      by its longevity - commencing in 2007 it has increased in frequency and in\u000a      popularity in each succeeding year and major events are planned for 2014\u000a      and 2015 - as well as by its transfer to other parts of Scotland e.g. the\u000a      2010 Glasgow Film Festival invited Alan Marcus to stage a Director's\u000a        Cut at the Glasgow Film Theatre featuring Academy Award-winning\u000a      director Kevin Macdonald (Touching the Void, Last King of Scotland),\u000a      which was subsequently broadcast on BBC Radio.\u000a    These impacts are enhanced by the practice-based offshoots of The\u000a        Director's Cut in the masterclasses held in the Belmont Picturehouse\u000a      to give local filmmakers the opportunity to learn from visiting directors,\u000a      and in the Junior Director's Cut filmmaking competitions,\u000a      organised in conjunction with Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire schools in 2009\u000a      and 2012. The Director's Cut has also developed significant\u000a      external partnerships which include the Norwegian Embassy, Glasgow Film\u000a      Festival, Scottish Screen, Creative Scotland, Picturehouse Cinemas, BBC\u000a      Radio and BAFTA Scotland, many of whom have used the series to promote\u000a      their own public engagement agendas, as well as with Aberdeen City\u000a      Council, which selected In the Birch Grove (2012) and In Place\u000a        of Death (2008) for a special screening and workshop in\u000a      commemoration of Holocaust Memorial Day. The City Council has also\u000a      commissioned a series of documentary films on local artists, made by\u000a      recent graduates of the University and overseen by Marcus, as part of its\u000a      bid to become `City of Culture'.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study examines the impact of Alan Marcus's work as documentary\u000a      film director, practice-based researcher and organiser of a series of\u000a      events known as The Director's Cut, in which he interviews\u000a      internationally renowned filmmakers, script writers, composers, actors and\u000a      animators to bring out, for a public audience, the paradigms, creative\u000a      influences and innovations that shape their work.

research combines the creative, technical and research expertise\u000a      of someone who has worked in both British and American broadcasting with a\u000a      profound interest in the afterlife of places of traumatic historical\u000a      experience. His In Time of Place films (2008-2010, www.abdn.ac.uk\/timeofplace)\u000a      explore the relationship between places of traumatic memory and their\u000a      contemporary `banal' reality, in order to chart the ways in which modern\u000a      societies have rendered the horrors of their recent histories into\u000a      consumable events. The films evoke survivor experiences but relate them to\u000a      the de-traumatised landscapes shaped by modern urban design, mass tourism\u000a      and a globalised culture in which memory does not confront us with horror\u000a      but distances us from it. The research underpinning the films is thus\u000a      historical (the detailed investigation of the source of trauma),\u000a      sociocultural (the residue of past events as they are memorialised in\u000a      particular places) and ethnographic (how people live in or visit such\u000a      places in the present); it is also self-reflexive about how picture and\u000a      sound can dramatise the relationship between place, time and memory.\u000a    The films are based on extensive archival research, interviews with\u000a      survivors and holocaust scholars, together with detailed architectural,\u000a      environmental and ethnographic exploration of the locations on which they\u000a      are focused. Thus In the Birch Grove took its inspiration from an\u000a      interview with Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel at his\u000a      offices in New York, and its form from Marcus's encounter with Johann\u000a      Kremer's diary during a week-long investigation into the archives of the\u000a      US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The film, with its long shots\u000a      of the remains of Auschwitz, is punctuated by texts from Kramer's diary\u000a      that underline the `banality of evil' (in Hannah Arendt's famous phrase),\u000a      but also the banality of the aftermath of evil. Each of the films explores\u000a      that banality by different visual and aural techniques, so The\u000a        Cemetery employs a form that Marcus describes as `snapshot\u000a      ethnography', which adopts the formal structure of the snapshot in order\u000a      to capture scenes in which all the participants are using cameras and\u000a      cameraphones to capture their own presence in a Jewish cemetery in a city,\u000a      Prague, that was virtually cleared of Jews in the Second World War. These\u000a      `film meditations' in places such as Munich\/Dachau (In Place of Death,\u000a      2008), Venice (The Ghetto, 2009), Prague (The Cemetery,\u000a      2010) and Boston (The Memorial, 2010) have achieved international\u000a      recognition and are now held by major museums (e.g. the Museum of Modern\u000a      Art, New York; the Getty Center; the Huntington Museum) and Holocaust\u000a      memorial institutions (e.g. The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity, New\u000a      York; the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington; the Imperial War\u000a      Museum, London). Marcus has himself analysed the content and style of his\u000a      `practice-based research' in book chapters such as `A Tale of Two Cities:\u000a      Dachau and KZ Munich' (in Kroeck, ed., The City and the Moving Image:\u000a        Urban Projections, 2010) and `Beautiful Dachau's Contested Urban\u000a      Identity' (in Marcus and Neumann, eds, Visualizing the City,\u000a      2008).\u000a    Marcus uses his own personal experience of the research involved in\u000a      making film to inform his interviews in The Director's Cut series\u000a      with prominent filmmakers, script writers and animators, in order to bring\u000a      out the paradigms that inform their films, the creative influences which\u000a      have shaped their conception of film as a medium and the ways they try to\u000a      evoke particular reactions from their audiences. Commencing in November\u000a      2007 with Europe's most prolific avant-garde director, Raul Ruiz, the\u000a      series aims to foster dialogue between practitioners, academic staff,\u000a      students and members of the public. It is the only one of its kind in the\u000a      UK, and in over 30 events it has explored methodological innovation in the\u000a      work of filmmakers such as Sir David Attenborough, John Akomfrah, Craig\u000a      Armstrong, Simon Callow, Gurinder Chadha, Alex Cox, Guy Hamilton, David\u000a      Mackenzie, Kevin Macdonald, Hans Petter Moland, Pawel Pawlikowski, Malcolm\u000a      Ritchie, Nicolas Roeg and Jane Treays. Each event involves underpinning\u000a      research by Marcus into the work of his interviewee in order to focus what\u000a      is most distinctive about the individual's contribution to film practice.\u000a      These interviews attract very large audiences into the University of\u000a      Aberdeen (regularly over two hundred, nine hundred in the case of Sir\u000a      David Attenborough), requiring at times an audio-visual feed to an\u000a      overflow location, and most of the events are archived as webcasts\u000a      on-line, thereby serving as a public resource and attracting thousands\u000a      more viewers. Marcus's interview with Gordon Cameron of Pixar attracted\u000a      the largest single audience of any event at the University's May Festival\u000a      in 2013.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43363","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"1062947","Name":"Madagascar"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2589581","Name":"Algeria"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As part of the TNMUNDI project, the team organised two cultural events on\u000a      `Music and Migration' in Rabat (10-14 November 2008) and Southampton\u000a      (12-17 October 2009). [1] The events involved a range of participants and\u000a      audiences, including representatives of cultural institutions (the\u000a      Moroccan Ministry of Culture, the Institut Fran&#231;ais-Morocco and the\u000a      British Council-Morocco); the music industry (Casablanca-based recording\u000a      studio manager and festival organisers); the media (Hit Radio in Rabat,\u000a      Chief Editor of Songlines magazine in the UK); infant and primary\u000a      schoolchildren (at the Southampton event); and the general public (in\u000a      Morocco and the UK). Their aim was to increase understanding of the\u000a      processes of transnational networking amongst migrants, and demonstrate in\u000a      practice some of the more positive possibilities of transnational\u000a      migration.\u000a    At both events, a musicians' residency lasting three days brought\u000a      together migrant musicians who had participated in the project's empirical\u000a      research, and who also performed in public concerts. Conferences\u000a      consisting of academic papers and round table discussions were open to the\u000a      general public. The event in Rabat comprised 6 artists of Moroccan\u000a      background resident in Europe and Morocco, and the final event in\u000a      Southampton brought together 15 artists, 7 of Malagasy, and 8 of Algerian\u000a      and Moroccan origin. Kiwan was the principal organiser of the\u000a      Rabat event and co-organiser of the Southampton event. In both Rabat and\u000a      Southampton, specially devised concerts were curated by Zafimahaleo\u000a      Rasolofondraosolo (known as Dama), a leading musician, politician and\u000a      cultural activist from Madagascar who also served as one of the TNMUNDI\u000a      project consultants. The concert in Rabat attracted an audience of\u000a      approximately 80-100. At the Southampton event, two public concerts by\u000a      Malagasy and North African musicians each attracted an audience of\u000a      approximately 200. The first was a lunchtime concert featuring the\u000a      Madagascar All Stars. It was followed by a masterclass with the musicians\u000a      open to university music students. The second was an evening concert\u000a      showcasing work from the three-day residency between the North African and\u000a      Malagasy musicians. A number of the musicians also took part in workshops\u000a      in three infant and junior schools in Southampton and Portsmouth which\u000a      involved approximately 90 school children in years 3 and 5.\u000a    The TNMUNDI project impacted on civil society because it\u000a      influenced the form and content of associations between migrant musicians.\u000a      In doing so, it presented an alternative view of migration to the wider,\u000a      non-academic public. It also contributed to continuing personal and\u000a      professional development of the artists involved in the residencies. For\u000a      example, the Rabat event created a link between Dama, the London-based\u000a      musician Farid Nainia from the Moroccan group Momo, and the Paris-based\u000a      group Binobin, which subsequently was reconfirmed in their collaborating\u000a      in the final event in Southampton; and the event in Southampton itself\u000a      sparked off a new connection between London-based oud player Yazid Fentazi\u000a      from Algeria and R&#233;gis Gizavo from Madagascar. Similarly, since the\u000a      Southampton event took place, the Malagasy musicians have gone onto play\u000a      again at the Turner Sims Concert Hall and at the Songlines Encounter\u000a      Festival. [2] Furthermore, the Rabat event contributed to the professional\u000a      development of one of the musicians involved (Badre Belhachemi) in that it\u000a      allowed him to further develop the cultural enterprise, ABSAWT, of\u000a      which he is a founding member. ABSAWT's aim is to promote Moroccan\u000a      musicians across Africa, Europe and Canada and the Rabat `Music and\u000a      Migration' event which took place as part of the TNMUNDI project is listed\u000a      as one of their main public activities on the ABSAWT website. [3] In\u000a      addition, the partnership between the researchers and the Turner Sims\u000a      Concert Hall continued and led to a further EU funding bid in 2013\u000a      involving Kiwan, Meinhof and the Turner Sims Concert Hall. Quantitative\u000a      indicators of impact are the funding for our cultural events. The Rabat\u000a      event was funded by the British Council, the Institut Fran&#231;ais, the Conseil\u000a        de la Communaut&#233; marocaine &#224; l'&#233;tranger and the Fondation Hassan II,\u000a      Rabat. After the Rabat event, the director of the Institut Fran&#231;ais noted\u000a      that `In Rabat, the organisation was very professional [...] I attended a\u000a      good concert (essentially thanks to the work done by the musicians and\u000a      thanks to you'. [4] For the final event in Southampton, the Arts Council\u000a      England provided a grant for the two public concerts at the Turner Sims\u000a      Concert Hall.\u000a    The TNMUNDI project impacted on cultural life by generating new\u000a      ways of thinking that influenced the creative practice of the artists\u000a      involved; by creating, inspiring and supporting new forms of musical\u000a      expression from them; and by presenting their cultural heritage to\u000a      different audiences. Evidence for this is provided by testimonials from\u000a      the musicians and cultural sector professionals involved in both events.\u000a      With regards to the Rabat event, one of the Paris-based Moroccan musicians\u000a      said: `As artists, we have a tendency to function by instinct and\u000a        passion. Encounters of this type allow us to see things with more\u000a        distance and objectivity. This allows us to move forward in our work\u000a        thanks to the experiences of others.' [5] The co-founder of one of\u000a      Africa's largest urban music festivals, Le Boulevard des jeunes\u000a        musiciens in Casablanca, observed of the Rabat event that: `It's\u000a        very rewarding to stimulate the interest of researchers and academics. I\u000a        realise that our adventure with the Boulevard has become a real societal\u000a        phenomenon. It's also an opportunity to learn about other experiences,\u000a        which is very enriching for us.' [5] Finally, the curator of the\u000a      Rabat concert commented that: `The arts are an excellent vector of\u000a        communication which go beyond chauvinism and create bonds between people.'\u000a      [5] The TNMUNDI's impact on cultural life is further demonstrated by the\u000a      following comments from the Turner Sims Concert Hall manager in\u000a      Southampton: `The week's activities had an energy and enthusiasm unlike\u000a        almost anything else that we present here. There was a genuine feeling\u000a        among the musicians that they wanted to create something different and\u000a        meaningful rather than a repeat of what they might have done elsewhere\u000a        and this came across on all the occasions I met them.' [6]\u000a    The TNMUNDI project impacted on public discourse by presenting a\u000a      very different picture of `the migrant' to researchers, arts and cultural\u000a      professionals, public policy representatives and the general public. The\u000a      vast majority of research on migration is socio-economic in character.\u000a      Very often, migrants are portrayed by the media and governments as a\u000a      source of economic, cultural and social problems for the receiving\u000a      society, with migrants often being depicted as victims or fraudulent\u000a      (whether they be political exiles, students, economic or postcolonial\u000a      migrants). By focusing on artists in general and musicians in particular,\u000a      TNMUNDI demonstrated how migrants have a positive influence on the quality\u000a      of life of individuals and communities locally, nationally and\u000a      internationally. Evidence for this impact is demonstrated in the comments\u000a      of the Head of Southampton Music Services regarding the Madagascar All\u000a      Stars lunchtime concert, held at the Turner Sims Concert Hall: `I\u000a        thought the Allstars demonstrated beautifully how music works across\u000a        cultures and generations, presenting an ethos of inclusivity and\u000a        belonging.' [6] The impact on public discourse can also be\u000a      demonstrated in the following commentary from the moderator of a public\u000a      round-table discussion organised as part of the Southampton event,\u000a      entitled `Moving music, roots and routes: the artists' view'. The\u000a      moderator, (Co-editor of the Rough Guide to World Music and\u000a      Editor-in-Chief of Songlines Magazine, a major UK world music\u000a      publication), said: `I've seen a lot of performers from Madagascar, but\u000a        I've enjoyed none as much as the Madagascar Allstars who basically came\u000a        together thanks to this project. Great artists, from inside and outside\u000a        the country, making totally compelling music together. The collaboration\u000a        with the Moroccans was put together in a few days and had more rough\u000a        edges &#8212; which everybody admitted and that was the point. What was\u000a        interesting was the areas in which they met &#8212; often conceptual rather\u000a        than musical &#8212; the experience of being an &#233;migr&#233; and of missing your\u000a        homeland. In the Round Table both Moroccan and Malagasy artists spoke of\u000a        how they became more Moroccan or Malagasy as a result of being outside\u000a        the country. One of the most moving songs in the concert was when this\u000a        was expressed musically in a haunting Moroccan song of nostalgia. Having\u000a        been at the collaborative concert and chairing the discussion I could\u000a        see how beneficial the shared experience was for the musicians, but also\u000a        for us as the audience of a one-off concert.' [6] Further confirming\u000a      its impact on public discourse, the Southampton event was listed as part\u000a      of Southampton city's Black History Month in October 2009. The aims of\u000a      Black History Month are `to promote knowledge of black history and\u000a      experience, to disseminate information on positive black contributions, to\u000a      heighten confidence and awareness of black people in their cultural\u000a      heritage'. The TNMUNDI Music and Migration Conference was listed in the\u000a      Black History Month Guide as an event which contributed to these aims. [7]\u000a    The TNMUNDI project impacted on education by informing and\u000a      influencing the education of university students from Morocco, Europe and\u000a      North America who participated in the Rabat concert and conference. The\u000a      project also had an educational impact on primary school-age pupils in\u000a      Southampton, as the following testimonial regarding a workshop held with\u000a      Kiwan and three Moroccan musicians (14\/10\/2009) demonstrates: `The\u000a        children particularly enjoyed handling the instruments as some were\u000a        familiar and others totally new to us. [...] The multi cultural aspect\u000a        was an eye opener for our children who have little opportunity to meet\u000a        enthusiastic people\/musicians from different countries and cultures.'\u000a      [6] The workshops fed into the primary pupils' music curriculum and Ludlow\u000a      Junior school in particular have continued to build on their international\u000a      links following the workshop.\u000a    The TNMUNDI project impacted on policymaking at European level.\u000a      Kiwan and her colleagues were invited in 2007 by the Directorate General\u000a      for Internal Policies of the Union to report on Cultural Diasporas to the\u000a      European Parliament. They produced a 70-page policy document which\u000a      discusses and analyses aspects of the TNMUNDI project findings.[8] Drawing\u000a      on her TNMUNDI research on North African cultural diasporas, Kiwan was a\u000a      contributing author to this policy report, which was subsequently read by\u000a      European Members of Parliament.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Events organised as part of the TNMUNDI research project in 2008 and 2009\u000a      set out to increase understanding of the processes and practices of\u000a      migration among a range of audiences, including cultural practitioners,\u000a      public policy representatives, school children and the general public. The\u000a      research team focused on migrant musicians and their transnational\u000a      networks through concerts and workshops held in Rabat and Southampton,\u000a      demonstrating how transnational musicians create their professional\u000a      networks and how, in turn, they use these to make positive contributions\u000a      to the social and cultural well-being of nation-states inside and outside\u000a      Europe. At both events, the researchers discussed the cultural and\u000a      artistic impacts of transnational migration with representatives from\u000a      educational and cultural institutions, NGOs, the media, the music industry\u000a      and the artists themselves. As a result of the project, new professional\u000a      and cultural networks have been formed and the researchers provided input\u000a      to the development of European cultural policy.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Aberdeen\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Aberdeen (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Aberdeen","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007783}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2538475","Name":"Rabat"},{"GeoNamesId":"2553604","Name":"Casablanca"}],"References":"\u000a    Research Outputs\u000a    \u000aKiwan, N. and Meinhof, U.

Dr Nadia Kiwan\u000a      (in post at the University of Aberdeen since 1 January 2006) was\u000a      Co-Investigator, working with Professor Ulrike Meinhof (University of\u000a      Southampton) as Principal Investigator. Building on previous research by\u000a      the team on migrant musicians in European capital cities (Kiwan 2007;\u000a      Kiwan and Meinhof 2006; Kiwan and Kosnick 2006), the project investigated\u000a      the transnational networks of migrant musicians. It considered how artists\u000a      and cultural practitioners originating from North Africa and Madagascar\u000a      are able to construct or enter complex and diverse networks across Africa\u000a      and Europe; and how networking affects their own personal and professional\u000a      lives and those with whom they come into contact. Kiwan and Meinhof showed\u000a      that artists who create or enter such networks make use of, but go far\u000a      beyond, the traditional diasporic links which tie them to their countries\u000a      of origin (Kiwan and Meinhof 2011a; Kiwan and Meinhof 2011b; Meinhof,\u000a      Kiwan and Gibert 2010). Instead, they follow a different logic of\u000a      translocal or transnational networking. The project extended existing\u000a      transnational network research by providing systematic examples drawn from\u000a      empirical research, including substantive accounts of forty musicians and\u000a      musical groups originating from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt; forty\u000a      musicians and musical groups originating from Madagascar; and other arts\u000a      professionals, entrepreneurs and institutions with whom they come into\u000a      contact.\u000a    The researchers used the material gathered to re-theorize migration\u000a      networks. They elaborated the concept of `transcultural capital' (Kiwan\u000a      and Meinhof 2011), understood as the cultural knowledge, skills and\u000a      resources which transnational migrant musicians mobilise in order to\u000a      develop and sustain their artistic practice, and developed new\u000a      methodological approaches based on `hubs' of interconnection between key\u000a      individuals, places and cultural institutions across transnational spaces.\u000a      Of particular significance was the study's ability to demonstrate the\u000a      complex movements of migration, including settled migrant musicians in\u000a      their new countries of residence; migrant musicians who move\u000a      transnationally between their country of origin and new country of\u000a      residence; and those migrant musicians who move within and across `sending\u000a      and receiving' countries. The project's focus proved vital in achieving a\u000a      much more complex picture of the reach and impact of globalization.\u000a      Consequently, it produced an in-depth understanding of the various flows\u000a      and cycles of migration: country-internal migration, transnational\u000a      migration, and return migration. For example, it highlighted the\u000a      country-internal migrations of rap artists moving between Fes and\u000a      Casablanca; the transnational `to-ing and fro-ing' of one particular\u000a      musician between Lyon and Tunis; and the return migration of two female\u000a      musicians from Morocco, who had been based in France and Turkey before\u000a      returning `home'. Their network model thus embraced a much wider set of\u000a      interconnections than is usually the case in migration studies, and\u000a      provided a range of empirical material linking artists, cultural\u000a      institutions and civil society organisations in Madagascar, North Africa\u000a      (mainly Morocco and Algeria) and many countries in Europe (the UK,\u000a      Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43364","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The major milestones of the impact have been:\u000d\u000a    (i) the adoption of a Gaelic Language Act by the Scottish government in\u000d\u000a      2005. Scottish nationalism\u000d\u000a      is not, like Basque or Catalan nationalism, founded on defence of a\u000d\u000a      threatened language, and\u000d\u000a      there was no imperative, therefore, for a Labour and Liberal coalition\u000d\u000a      government in Scotland to\u000d\u000a      adopt a Gaelic language policy for political reasons. Rather, the\u000d\u000a      Government came to approach the\u000d\u000a      issue in terms of European policies in support of minority languages, a\u000d\u000a      European approach to\u000d\u000a      which the research of Dunbar, himself a lawyer, had significantly\u000d\u000a      contributed. Providing a legal\u000d\u000a      framework for the support of a minority language brought Scotland in line\u000d\u000a      with other European\u000d\u000a      jurisdictions in a non-politicised context (the bill received cross-party\u000d\u000a      support);\u000d\u000a    (ii) the establishment of the University of the Highlands and Islands as\u000d\u000a      a research university with a\u000d\u000a      strong commitment to Gaelic language research. This was in significant\u000d\u000a      part an outcome of the\u000d\u000a      SOILLSE initiative, but its broader aim has been to normalise the\u000d\u000a      use of Gaelic for academic\u000d\u000a      research, in the communications of public bodies and in the delivery of\u000d\u000a      outreach education for\u000d\u000a      adults as well as in Gaelic-medium education for children. The Rannsachadh\u000d\u000a      na G&#224;idhlig\u000d\u000a      conference held in Aberdeen in 2010 and the SOILLSE conference in\u000d\u000a      2011 witnessed\u000d\u000a      considerable increase in the number of papers about language planning\u000d\u000a      delivered through the\u000d\u000a      medium of Gaelic itself, and part of the result is the development of a\u000d\u000a      terminology which has been\u000d\u000a      disseminated into daily usage by those engaged in promoting the language\u000d\u000a      at grass-roots level;\u000d\u000a    (iii) Aberdeen leads on the `Community and Family Language Usage' strand\u000d\u000a      of SOILLSE's\u000d\u000a      activities. Macleod has directed two research projects in this\u000d\u000a      area: the first examined the working\u000d\u000a      patterns of community language development officers, and aimed at\u000d\u000a      improving their effectiveness\u000d\u000a      by providing training in project planning and the assessment of outcomes.\u000d\u000a      This was a `cascade'\u000d\u000a      project, dealing initially with 15 of the key professionals in the field\u000d\u000a      who could relay what they had\u000d\u000a      learned to others at more diversified levels of language delivery.\u000d\u000a        Macleod was also involved with\u000d\u000a      SOILLSE colleagues in a commissioned research project into the CPD\u000d\u000a      needs of professionals\u000d\u000a      working in Gaelic language development in the community.

A project on\u000d\u000a      the Delivery of Gaelic to\u000d\u000a      adults through &#217;lpan was commissioned by B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig in order to\u000d\u000a      inform their policy on\u000d\u000a      supporting adult learners: the report will shape future delivery\u000d\u000a      mechanisms. A second has been\u000d\u000a      designed to support Gaelic medium education delivery in primary schools\u000d\u000a      and the researchers\u000d\u000a      have worked alongside teachers in developing the project so that the end\u000d\u000a      results will properly\u000d\u000a      support the teachers in their work. They have also undertaken primary\u000d\u000a      research into the use of\u000d\u000a      Gaelic in specific environments (e.g. MacLeod's on Gaelic Language\u000d\u000a      Skills in the Workplace' and\u000d\u000a      Macleod's on community language workers and national strategies)\u000d\u000a      which have helped shape the\u000d\u000a      agenda of B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig.\u000d\u000a    The impact thus ranges from influence on national language strategies\u000d\u000a      down to the local\u000d\u000a      organisation of the delivery of language training in specific\u000d\u000a      environments.

This was achieved in\u000d\u000a      2011, with the University of\u000d\u000a      Aberdeen validating UHI's research degrees (Macleod was part of the\u000d\u000a      validation team).\u000d\u000a    Delivering the infrastructure which would support such an institution,\u000d\u000a      however, required research\u000d\u000a      into the ways in which Gaelic language teaching was provided, how Gaelic\u000d\u000a      language research at\u000d\u000a      tertiary level could be sustained, and the means by which Gaelic could be\u000d\u000a      the language for the\u000d\u000a      delivery of academic research. This became the third element of\u000d\u000a      underpinning research, in the\u000d\u000a      examination of how specific policy objectives could be met by practical\u000d\u000a      implementation at a grass-roots\u000d\u000a      level. Macleod and MacLeod's work on Gaelic language use\u000d\u000a      in the classroom, on Gaelic\u000d\u000a      language skills in the workplace, on the delivery of Gaelic to adult\u000d\u000a      learners through &#217;lpan (a\u000d\u000a      programme run on behalf of B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig) and on Continuous\u000d\u000a      Professional Development for\u000d\u000a      Language Workers, has helped inform policy for a variety of organisations\u000d\u000a      seeking to implement\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Government's language framework.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43408","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"51537","Name":"Somalia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Patrick was one of the authors involved in producing the 2004 Guidelines\u000d\u000a      for use of LADO, which are aimed at a lay audience and outline best\u000d\u000a      practice. The guidelines have been the focus of court cases in which\u000d\u000a      Patrick has drawn on his empirical sociolinguistic research background and\u000d\u000a      forensic linguistic experience to provide advice to legal teams. He has\u000d\u000a      also disseminated expertise to professionals and been instrumental in\u000d\u000a      establishing dialogue between academics and a range of practitioners.\u000d\u000a    The development of guidelines for the use of LADO\u000d\u000a    Patrick is among 19 authors of the 2004 Guidelines for the Use of\u000d\u000a        Language Analysis in relation to Questions of National Origin in Refugee\u000d\u000a        Cases, which are aimed at lawyers, administrative judges, asylum\u000d\u000a      activists, and government agencies making asylum decisions. The Guidelines\u000d\u000a      address the complexity of issues of language variation and socialisation,\u000d\u000a      speech community, and nationality, arguing expertise should come from\u000d\u000a      qualified experts. The head of Dutch LADO firm De Taalstudio notes that\u000d\u000a      \"His [Patrick's] influence is very visible in the Guidelines, as\u000d\u000a      they stress the central relevance of sociolinguistic research to LADO\u000d\u000a      cases, laid out in terms understandable to lay people and acceptable to\u000d\u000a      professional linguists\" [corroborating source 1]. Patrick assisted in\u000d\u000a      securing endorsement of the Guidelines by twelve national and\u000d\u000a      international linguistic associations [corroborating source 2]. Further to\u000d\u000a      this, the Guidelines have been made available through the UN High\u000d\u000a      Commissioner for Refugees' RefWorld service to legal and NGO\u000d\u000a      practitioners worldwide, largely through Patrick's efforts in August 2010\u000d\u000a      [3]. The need for LADO evidence in asylum cases to comply with the Guidelines\u000d\u000a      has been a contentious legal issue, especially in Scotland, where Patrick\u000d\u000a      has advised on a notable case.\u000d\u000a    Advising legal teams and writing expert reports for asylum tribunals\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, Patrick has submitted over 60 linguistic expert reports\u000d\u000a      (15-25 pages) to UK asylum tribunals in appeals cases. His\u000d\u000a      sociolinguistic, variationist and creolist research background qualifies\u000d\u000a      him legally as an expert and is crucial in writing reports. As confirmed\u000d\u000a      by the head of De Taalstudio, Patrick's research expertise in variation in\u000d\u000a      Creole languages is particularly vital, as many LADO cases involve Creole\u000d\u000a      speakers [1]. His involvement as an expert in many UK asylum cases is\u000d\u000a      cited repeatedly by judges in case determinations. In 2011, he was one of\u000d\u000a      two linguists (the only one based in the UK) commissioned to provide\u000d\u000a      expert testimony in a High Court appeal. The Upper Tribunal returned the\u000d\u000a      cases for re-hearing by lower courts, partly due to Patrick's report [4].\u000d\u000a      The appealing QC has distributed Patrick's report amongst a network of UK\u000d\u000a      asylum lawyers as a model of expert arguments relating to language\u000d\u000a      elements in asylum cases [5].\u000d\u000a    The highest-profile case that Patrick has been involved with has been\u000d\u000a      that of a Somali asylum-seeking woman (known as K.A.S.Y.), which had been\u000d\u000a      referred to the Inner House of the Court of Sessions (the Scottish\u000d\u000a      equivalent to England's Court of Appeal). Patrick was recruited by an\u000d\u000a      advocate working on the case in order to provide expert guidance for an\u000d\u000a      appeal because of his record of producing reports for asylum cases in\u000d\u000a      England [6]. The case involved a specific challenge to the use of SPRAKAB\u000d\u000a      language reports in asylum cases &#8212; such reports are commissioned by the\u000d\u000a      Home Office, but do not comply with the Guidelines. Patrick\u000d\u000a      attended a case consultation with the legal team, led by Michael Howlin\u000d\u000a      QC, in order to provide advice and analysis. The advocate, who worked as\u000d\u000a      part of this team, writes:\u000d\u000a    \"I have no hesitation in saying that Professor Patrick's input at that\u000d\u000a      consultation was to prove absolutely invaluable. He provided us with the\u000d\u000a      scientific analysis of LADO that essentially formed the basis of Mr.\u000d\u000a      Howlin's submission, which is reproduced at paras. [37] &#8212; [42] of the case\u000d\u000a      report in M.Ab.N. &amp; K.A.S.Y. The analysis there set out,\u000d\u000a      subsequently adopted and approved by the Inner House, was based almost\u000d\u000a      entirely on the guidance and advice imparted by Professor Patrick at the 1st\u000d\u000a      November consultation\" [6].\u000d\u000a    The appeal was heard in December 2012 and January 2013, with the decision\u000d\u000a      being issued on 12th July 2013 [7]. The judgement found that\u000d\u000a      the Guidelines are the yardstick by which LADO evidence should be\u000d\u000a      assessed and that the use of SPRAKAB reports can be challenged. Therefore,\u000d\u000a      as a result of this case there are, as of July 2013, conflicting\u000d\u000a      precedents in Scotland and England. The advocate acknowledges that the\u000d\u000a      Home Office may appeal the decision in the UK Supreme Court but he states\u000d\u000a      that the judgement \"is of immense significance\" and adds:\u000d\u000a    \"If this decision stands, thousands of adverse asylum decisions will be\u000d\u000a      invalidated, and where persons affected remain in the UK, then their cases\u000d\u000a      will need to be re-opened... And if my client does end up getting\u000d\u000a      permission to stay in the UK, she will owe that almost entirely to the\u000d\u000a      work of Professor Patrick\" [6].\u000d\u000a    Dissemination of expertise to professionals\u000d\u000a    Patrick has convened or participated in colloquia on LADO in the\u000d\u000a      Netherlands, Switzerland, Ireland, Sweden, the US and UK. He has ensured\u000d\u000a      that the practitioner\/researcher dialogue becomes firmly established in\u000d\u000a      this field by giving LADO seminars to a diverse range of professionals.\u000d\u000a      The four ESRC Research Seminars he convened in 2011-12 hosted participants\u000d\u000a      from Africa, Australia, North America and Europe, and included\u000d\u000a      sociolinguists, language specialists, immigration lawyers and judges,\u000d\u000a      doctors, geneticists, anthropologists, human rights practitioners, police,\u000d\u000a      psychoanalysts, forensic scientists, four commercial LADO firms, and six\u000d\u000a      government bureaux (Austrian, Belgian, Dutch, Norwegian, Swiss, UK) [8].\u000d\u000a      The seminars provided a platform to exchange expertise and focus on\u000d\u000a      developing and achieving acceptance of professional linguistic standards\u000d\u000a      and best practice in the asylum sphere. Writing about the seminars, a\u000d\u000a      former head of LINGUA, a LADO unit that is part of the Swiss Federal\u000d\u000a      Office for Migration, has praised Patrick's ability to bring practitioners\u000d\u000a      and academics together and writes that his efforts \"have proven very\u000d\u000a      valuable to LINGUA\" [9]. The head of De Taalstudio comments that \"thanks\u000d\u000a      to Patrick's role in the preparation and conduct of the ESRC meetings, a\u000d\u000a      highly polarised debate, characterised by processes of exclusion, has\u000d\u000a      turned into a constructive dialogue involving all stakeholders\" [1].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Essex research on language variation has been central to the development\u000d\u000a      of the best-practice Guidelines for Language Analysis for\u000d\u000a      Determination of Origin (LADO) &#8212; an instrument used to determine whether\u000d\u000a      an asylum seeker's claim of origin is genuine.

Patrick's\u000d\u000a      work has been vital in establishing the core concepts of speech community\u000d\u000a      and language socialisation in the sociolinguistic analysis of every LADO\u000d\u000a      case. Models of speaker membership patterns in multi-variety speech\u000d\u000a      communities, discussed in Patrick (2002), provide grounds for reports\u000d\u000a      arguing that courts must recognise complex language socialisation\u000d\u000a      patterns, and see beyond folk notions of bilingualism and simplistic\u000d\u000a      expectations (e.g. that language and national boundaries will cohere). His\u000d\u000a      work on LADO is underpinned by a large body of research on language\u000d\u000a      variation, which he makes central to establishing the credibility of\u000d\u000a      asylum claims.\u000d\u000a    Patrick's research utilises sociolinguistic methodology and quantitative\u000d\u000a      variationist analysis to investigate structural variability. It examines\u000d\u000a      how such variation patterns with social influences to delimit and\u000d\u000a      characterise speech communities in linguistic terms. He has undertaken\u000d\u000a      variationist research on Creoles and dialect speech communities, and has\u000d\u000a      then applied methodologies from this variationist research to inform his\u000d\u000a      work in LADO.\u000d\u000a    Patrick and Straw (2007) used acoustic phonetic methods to study the\u000d\u000a      forms, variation and social distribution of \/t\/ in two matched samples of\u000d\u000a      Barbadian- and Anglo-ancestry communities of British English speakers in\u000d\u000a      Ipswich. They problematized one of the UK's best-studied phonological\u000d\u000a      variables, found that Ipswich does not follow a widely-hypothesised\u000d\u000a      diffusion pattern of phonological constraints, and demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      dialect acquisition occurs only in the third generation of Barbadian\u000d\u000a      migrants. Such methods are widely applicable to features allegedly\u000d\u000a      distinctive between speakers of varieties A and B, where native speakers\u000d\u000a      born in A qualify for asylum and those in B do not.\u000d\u000a    Patrick's variationist research in Creoles has explored the nature of\u000d\u000a      inherent variation in Jamaican Creole grammar, linking it to age, class,\u000d\u000a      education and gender (Patrick, 1999). The edited volume, Comparative\u000d\u000a        Creole Syntax (Holm and Patrick, 2007), to which Patrick contributed\u000d\u000a      the analysis of Jamaican Creole, provides comparative analysis of the\u000d\u000a      grammar of 18 Creoles and is frequently cited in reports where asylum\u000d\u000a      cases involve speakers of relevant Creoles. Patrick's survey of variation\u000d\u000a      in Pidgin and Creole languages (2008) examined how much variability\u000d\u000a      contact languages can exhibit, and related such claims to creolisation and\u000d\u000a      nativisation &#8212; crucial factors to take account of in LADO cases, where\u000d\u000a      someone is argued to be (or to not be) a speaker of language X because\u000d\u000a      variation has not been adequately attended to. Finally, Patrick (2010), in\u000d\u000a      the first edited volume specifically on LADO, showed how linguistic\u000d\u000a      uniformity and sociolinguistic norms define the speech community, and\u000d\u000a      examined the range of competence of native speakers in this light. He\u000d\u000a      argued for general application of variationist methods to develop the\u000d\u000a      research basis for determining LADO cases.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43477","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Note: research references are cited as [x], corroborative sources as\u000a        {x}.\u000a      The main beneficiary of the impact is our collaborating laboratory, J P\u000a      French Associates, the UK's largest lab for forensic speech and audio\u000a      analysis and widely recognised as a world leader in the field. Our\u000a      research also benefits other forensic speech analysts, and judicial\u000a      systems in the UK and internationally. The impact of the research base is\u000a      felt in several ways:\u000a    1. Professional support to J P French Associates (JPFA)\u000a    \u000a      Foulkes, Llamas and Watt act as consultants for JPFA, conducting\u000a        casework and\/or providing research-led insights to casework conducted by\u000a        JPFA (especially via expert insight into Scottish and northern\/midlands\u000a        English dialects, variables for analysis, distribution of features and\u000a        extent of expected variability of features). York staff were consulted\u000a        in over 30 cases in 2008-13. {8}\u000a\u000a      Methodologies developed in sociophonetics have been applied to\u000a        forensic casework by JPFA and York staff. For example, formal\u000a        quantification of sociolinguistic variables was integral to a 2009 case,\u000a        establishing that an evidential recording was highly unlikely to have\u000a        been produced by the suspect [6, p. 566]. Research on the\u000a        acoustic effects of face coverings [10] was applied to an appeal\u000a        case in 2013, in which audibility tests were reconstructed by the York\u000a        group. The key issue was whether the speaker at the scene of the crime,\u000a        wearing a motorcycle helmet, could have been heard or identified by\u000a        witnesses. (Both cases are in progress in July 2013.)\u000a      Our research with earwitnesses provides new insights into the factors\u000a        that may affect witness recall of voices they have heard (e.g. whether\u000a        the voice was shouting, disguised, or transmitted by telephone). This\u000a        body of work confirms the view that earwitness testimony must be\u000a        assessed with a detailed understanding of the specific context of each\u000a        case, and enhances a court's ability to assess the reliability of the\u000a        testimony. Work such as [3] is regularly cited in JPFA case reports for\u000a        UK and international cases, e.g. in R -v- Miah &amp; ors (2009); DPP -v- Tighe &amp; Tighe, (Ireland 2010); HMA -v- Gallagher (2010), R -v- Tongue (2012), R -v- Karsten (2013). {8}\u000a\u000a      Voice quality analysis has rarely been included in speaker comparison\u000a        reports, despite its clear potential as a diagnostic feature for\u000a        analysis. In 2008 Watt and Foulkes assisted JPFA in developing a method,\u000a        based on Laver's VPA protocol, to enable JPFA to undertake formal voice\u000a        quality analysis for the first time. It has since been used in over 500\u000a        cases. {8}\u000a\u000a      JPFA staff, benefitting from direct access to a thriving research\u000a        culture through our collaboration, have greatly increased their own\u000a        research output and involvement with wider academic communities (e.g. [6,8,10,12,14,15],\u000a        {2,3,8}, two staff engaged in Marie Curie FP7 grant (&#8364;3.2m) [14],\u000a        support to JPFA through University of York research funding [11]).\u000a      Our collaboration has contributed towards the professional development\u000a        of staff at JPFA. All five junior analysts are York Masters graduates,\u000a        with four undertaking PhDs at York in 2008-13. They routinely apply\u000a        research skills and insights acquired during their training to casework,\u000a        drawing on our research outputs. Peter French summarises the impact as\u000a        follows: \"JPFA's unique relationship with the University of York has\u000a        enabled the firm to be at the forefront of research in modelling\u000a        individual speaker characteristics. This has provided us with a better\u000a        understanding of the strengths and limitations of the various approaches\u000a        to forensic speaker comparison and assisted with our developing new\u000a        practical phonetic and acoustic measures for use in casework. The\u000a        research and general input of members of the University has been\u000a        invaluable to us and facilitated our rise to the position of the UK's\u000a        largest and most prominent independent forensic speech and acoustics\u000a        laboratory.\" {8}\u000a\u000a    \u000a    2. Provision of expert testimony and opinion\u000a    \u000a      In 2008-13 Foulkes and Watt were lead or sole authors on expert\u000a        reports in over 20 UK and international cases. Foulkes provided a\u000a        written report and evidence in court in the high profile case of David\u000a        Bain's retrial for the murder of five members of his family (New\u000a        Zealand, 2008). The evidence played an integral role in a disputed\u000a        section of a recording being excised prior to the jury hearing it. Bain\u000a        has been described as a \"unique case\" in New Zealand legal history, \"the\u000a        first time that such detailed linguistic evidence... with such potential\u000a        impact on such a significant trial has been successful in the New\u000a        Zealand courts, the success lying in its having been heard in its\u000a        entirety and its import accepted\" {4, p. 154}. In 2013\u000a        Watt produced case reports for courts in Malaysia and Northern Ireland,\u000a        having been identified as an appropriate expert on the strength of his\u000a        research on speech by people wearing face coverings [10]. The\u000a        Malaysian trial was for kidnap by a person whose face was masked, while\u000a        the Northern Irish case concerned intelligibility of the voice of a\u000a        robber wearing a scarf across his face. The Malaysian judge excluded the\u000a        prosecution expert's evidence on the basis of Watt's report.\u000a      Casework conducted by Foulkes and Watt routinely involves analysis of\u000a        phonetic and linguistic features that they have analysed in detail in\u000a        sociophonetic research [4-7,9]. For example, in 2010 Watt\u000a        provided expert opinion in the perjury case of the former MSP Tommy\u000a        Sheridan, drawing on his expertise in variation in Scottish English [9,13],\u000a        {6}.\u000a    \u000a    3. Improving national and international practice in forensic speaker\u000a        comparison\u000a    \u000a      Our research on mobile telephone transmission showed acoustic effects\u000a        on vowel formants are far more serious than those in landline recordings\u000a        [2]. Case analysis must therefore accommodate these factors, and\u000a        appropriate steps be taken in acoustic analysis of case materials to\u000a        cater for major differences in acoustic properties caused by the\u000a        technical transmission (correcting first formant measurements or\u000a        avoiding them altogether). This work is widely recognised and its\u000a        findings applied routinely by analysts at many forensic agencies,\u000a        including the US Secret Service {1}, BKA (German State forensic\u000a        laboratory) {5}, NFI {11}, Royal Canadian Mounted Police\u000a        {9}, as well as JPFA {2}.\u000a      Phonetic insights on variation were integral to the development of a\u000a        new framework for the expression of conclusions in 2007, in\u000a        collaboration between York staff, JPFA, and colleagues at the University\u000a        of Cambridge [8]. It was adopted as a common framework by almost\u000a        all forensic phoneticians in the UK. This represents a marked change in\u000a        the format used to present expert evidence. It offers a logical and\u000a        legal advance on its predecessor, which incorrectly led analysts to\u000a        offer definitive statements about speaker identity in a binary or\u000a        probabilistic framework (effectively delivering a judgment of guilt,\u000a        which is properly a matter for the trier of fact not the expert\u000a        witness). The UK framework has since been translated and adopted by\u000a        practitioners in other countries including Germany, Spain, and Turkey.\u000a        In Turkey, for example, the framework has been used in over 300 cases\u000a        conducted since 2008 by the national forensic laboratory. {10}\u000a\u000a      Since 2008 practising forensic analysts from Denmark, Norway, the\u000a        Netherlands, and Spain have undertaken professional training at York,\u000a        including via the MSc in Forensic Speech Science (either the full degree\u000a        or key modules). The MSc provides a theoretical and practical grounding\u000a        in forensic speech science, especially speaker comparison. It is\u000a        squarely based on the research strengths of the York group, and on the\u000a        working practices of JPFA. These analysts employ skills and insights\u000a        from their training at York in their casework. For example, Jos\u000a        Vermeulen MSc is now the sole registered speech expert at the\u000a        Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI; an agency of the Ministry of\u000a        Security and Justice, and one of the world's leading forensic labs). All\u000a        reports and witness testimony he produces are based in part on York\u000a        research (e.g. [2,3,6]). Sociolinguistic research in particular\u000a        has led to a \"sharpening\" of casework methods in the context of\u000a        multilingual societies [4,7,11]. He describes the MSc as \"the\u000a        most relevant academic degree in the world\" for the training of forensic\u000a        practitioners in this field. {11}\u000a\u000a      In 2012 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police appointed a York MSc\/PhD\u000a        graduate, Colleen Kavanagh, as a forensic speech expert. She is part of\u000a        a unit which offers service to all of Canada. She applies research\u000a        methods and insights from her training in her casework. Her appointment\u000a        allowed the RCMP to include the phonetically-based UK practice [6,8]\u000a        for some cases. This has led to an increase in the number of cases\u000a        accepted by the lab (9 cases in 2013 as of 23\/8\/13, versus 1 to 6 cases\u000a        in each of the previous seven years). In previous years, most requests\u000a        were turned away because the recordings could not meet the RCMP's\u000a        criteria. {9}\u000a\u000a      In 2009-11 the UK Law Commission undertook a full review of the law on\u000a        expert evidence, prompted by a call for reform from the House of\u000a        Commons' Science and Technology Committee. This call reflected concern\u000a        that expert opinion evidence was being admitted in criminal proceedings\u000a        too readily and with insufficient scrutiny, and in light of concern over\u000a        public confidence in the expert witness system. One aim of the review\u000a        was to approach standardisation of the treatment of different forensic\u000a        sciences. York led the UK group of forensic speech scientists in this\u000a        review, holding a meeting of over 20 practitioners and interested\u000a        academics in 2009. The response of the group was cited at length in the\u000a        resulting guidelines on expert evidence. Based on our understanding of\u000a        the complexities of speech, and the difficulties in applying linguistic\u000a        analysis to forensic materials, we argued against a proposal to separate\u000a        forensic practice into `science-based' and `experience-based'. Instead,\u000a        we argued that most forensic analysis involves an application of\u000a        scientific principles mediated by the analyst's experience. Our position\u000a        was accepted as a general principle for forensic experts. {7}\u000a\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Forensic speaker comparison is the analysis of recorded speech with\u000a      evidential value in legal (usually criminal) cases.

This\u000a      is evidenced by a series of externally-funded projects (particularly on\u000a      variation and change in British English, e.g. [13]), and\u000a      investigation of fine phonetic detail and variation in speech production\u000a      and perception. Key York staff are Paul Foulkes\u000a      (Lecturer\/Reader\/Professor, 2000-present), Carmen Llamas (Lecturer\/Senior\u000a      Lecturer, 2007-present), and Dominic Watt (Lecturer\/Senior Lecturer,\u000a      2007-present).\u000a    Our research yields new insights into the sources, loci and parameters of\u000a      phonetic variation, the effect such variation has on listeners, and how\u000a      this knowledge base can be drawn upon in forensic speaker comparison. York\u000a      research establishes that structured variation in speech is caused by a\u000a      far wider range of factors than is generally acknowledged in forensic\u000a      phonetics, or in cognate fields such as speech\/speaker recognition\u000a      technology, revealing speech to be one of the most complex types of\u000a      biometric information [4, 6, 7, 9]. This research enhances the\u000a      foundation for reliable forensic speaker comparison: it provides an\u000a      improved understanding of the distribution of phonetic features, the\u000a      extent of variation found within speakers and populations, and the wide\u000a      range of non-linguistic factors that affect speech and the acoustic\u000a      signal. The outcome is a holistic perspective on linguistic variation and\u000a      its probative value. The work supports and strengthens the\u000a      phonetically-based approach to forensic speech analysis advocated in the\u000a      UK over the last few decades, highlighting its advantages over the\u000a      discredited method of `voiceprinting', and demonstrating its\u000a      complementarity with rapidly-developing methods from speech technology [6,\u000a        8]. The research base also enhances our understanding of\u000a      ear-witnesses' testimony about voices and factors that affect memory and\u000a      recall of voices [3].\u000a    Several research projects have been conducted specifically to address\u000a      issues in speaker comparison, including in connection with particular\u000a      forensic cases. These include:\u000a    \u000a      establishing population distributions for numerous features of English\u000a        dialects (Foulkes, Llamas, Watt; ESRC, IAFPA &amp; Marie Curie grants; [1,\u000a          4, 5, 9, 12-14]).\u000a      experimental work to investigate the effects of technical factors on\u000a        acoustic signals, e.g. transmission of speech through mobile phone\u000a        technology, revealing much more severe deleterious effects than in\u000a        landline transmission (Foulkes; [2]).\u000a      experimental work on garments worn over the mouth or face, such as\u000a        surgical masks, balaclavas, or the niqaab, testing their effects on\u000a        speech acoustics and intelligibility (Llamas &amp; Watt; IAFPA &amp;\u000a        Marie Curie grants; [10, 14]).\u000a      experimental work to understand factors that affect earwitnesses'\u000a        ability to identify voices, including the type, technical quality, and\u000a        duration of the speech sample, individual ability of listeners, and\u000a        familiarity with the speaker (Foulkes; [3]).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43490","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In working with BAE Systems, a leading UK manufacturer of advanced\u000a      defence and security systems, Arnold has so far contributed to two\u000a      projects: the first, `Free Text Processing', took place from September to\u000a      December, 2009; the second, `Advanced Data Sharing Agreements', ran from\u000a      March to November, 2011. Given their potential uses in emergency\u000a      situations and high-security operations, both projects required systems\u000a      for NLP that utilised `high-precision' techniques. In his consultancy role\u000a      Arnold was able to draw upon his published research in the formal\u000a      description of English and computational grammar, as well as his expertise\u000a      in the syntax-semantics interface. It was not the case that BAE Systems\u000a      simply made use of Arnold's research and ideas. Instead, he was actively\u000a      involved in supplying practical guidance and was thus a key factor in\u000a      realising applications of his research and expertise. BAE Systems'\u000a      University and Collaborative Relationships Manager has corroborated the\u000a      claims made in this section and all quotations below come from a statement\u000a      that he has provided.\u000a    The theme common to the two projects is the aim of allowing ordinary\u000a      users to communicate with various automatic systems using a subset of\u000a      English (`controlled English'). In the case of the first project, the aim\u000a      was to allow Emergency Service personnel (e.g. police or ambulance crews)\u000a      to communicate precise narrative detail about a developing emergency\u000a      situation. This communication would take place through a discourse like \"A\u000a      car and a bicycle have collided on Coval Road. The cyclist has injured her\u000a      leg. She has been taken to Chelmsford A and E.\", which might generate a\u000a      pictorial display on a command and control room map. This type of\u000a      discourse poses serious analytic challenges at the limit of current\u000a      understanding and technology in NLP. BAE Systems have stated that \"the\u000a      project successfully demonstrated that `free text' messages, in the\u000a      abbreviated and specialised language used by emergency workers, could\u000a      provide a valuable enrichment of the operational picture\".\u000a    The second project was similar in that it involved automatically\u000a      transforming text into a pictorial display. This project involved\u000a      developing a prototype interface for facilitating secure sharing of\u000a      sensitive data across organisations. Data-sharing agreements between\u000a      organisations determine which documents can be read by whom and in what\u000a      circumstances. The aim was to produce a piece of software that allows\u000a      data-sharing agreements to be visualised in order to verify that the text\u000a      is consistent (i.e. not self-contradictory). This means that an agreement\u000a      can be generated automatically from typescript in English, but no special\u000a      skills are required to either write it, or to read and understand it. The\u000a      software recognises contradictions, such as someone being allowed to view\u000a      documents under certain circumstances but forbidding them from being in\u000a      such circumstances.\u000a    As BAE Systems have confirmed, both projects achieved their goals as a\u000a      feasibility-of-concept demonstration system was produced for each. Drawing\u000a      on Arnold's research and expertise, the BAE Systems project teams were\u000a      able to greatly improve their understanding of the problems and the\u000a      techniques and technologies available. BAE Systems have gone on record as\u000a      saying:\u000a    \"Dr. Arnold's role in both projects was critical, in two main ways.\u000a      First, his understanding and command of the fundamental theoretical\u000a      concepts meant that the projects were able to focus on the fundamentally\u000a      important issues, this was important both in the design and execution of\u000a      the projects. Second, his awareness of the capacities and limitations of\u000a      advanced research tools and toolsets for Natural Language Processing meant\u000a      that the projects were able to make more informed and appropriate choices\u000a      among existing tools, and were able to focus resources on areas where\u000a      existing tools are inadequate\"\u000a    He was thus able to provide BAE Systems with tools and models for\u000a      conceptualising what they were trying to build. In so doing, he allowed\u000a      staff at BAE Systems to better understand the parameters of the types of\u000a      system they were attempting to construct.\u000a    His guidance to BAE Systems included supplying information about which\u000a      systems were research-only and providing an appreciation of the limits of\u000a      different technologies. The latter proved crucial as his contribution\u000a      involved not only helping to develop certain systems but also giving\u000a      advice about what should be abandoned and what was not possible. Indeed,\u000a      BAE Systems have stated that Arnold's contribution enabled the teams \"to\u000a      contemplate a range of novel projects, but also avoiding projects whose\u000a      goals are over-ambitious given the current state of the art.\" BAE Systems\u000a      added that avoiding over-ambitious projects is an \"aspect of technology\u000a      transfer [that] is often neglected in university-industry collaboration\u000a      and Dr Arnold's contribution has been greatly appreciated\".\u000a    The success of the two projects is demonstrated by BAE Systems inviting\u000a      Arnold to work on a further initiative in March and April 2013. This\u000a      involved collaboration on a proposal for a future project on the\u000a      extraction of information from dialogue. Arnold prepared a report on the\u000a      current state of the art, which again relied on his research expertise on\u000a      rule-based machine translation.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Essex research into the practical deployment of computational grammar\u000a      theories, tools and techniques led to the expertise of Dr Doug Arnold\u000a      being sought between 2009 and 2011 by BAE Systems, a leading UK\u000a      manufacturer of advanced defence and security systems. Arnold advised the\u000a      company on the design of two prototype natural-language interfaces for\u000a      responding to emergency situations and sharing sensitive data across\u000a      organisations.

In short, his work\u000a      has concentrated on the problems, both theoretical and practical, of how\u000a      the English language can be `understood' by a computer. Arnold has not\u000a      only produced a considerable volume of publications in this area, but\u000a      working in this field has also allowed him to gain hands-on experience of\u000a      developing practical applications and acquire a working knowledge of\u000a      cutting-edge tools and techniques.\u000a    Arnold has published on a range of topics relevant to the practical\u000a      application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) since the mid-1990s,\u000a      including how systems should be evaluated (Arnold et al., 1993), the\u000a      design of resources for testing systems (Balkan et al., 1995), and how\u000a      systems for one purpose can be reused for other purposes (Arnold, 1994).\u000a      Much of the crucial research underpinning the impact described in Section\u000a      4 has been Arnold's knowledge of, and expertise in, the application of the\u000a      syntax and semantics of a wide range of grammatical constructions in\u000a      English (see e.g. Arnold, 2007; Arnold and Sadler, 2010, which deal with\u000a      the syntax and semantics of relative clauses). This work is combined with\u000a      hands-on, practical knowledge of extant programming languages and\u000a      techniques, as well as, most significantly, their limitations (see Arnold\u000a      and Linardaki, 2007, which addresses the limitations of certain\u000a      statistical approaches to NLP).\u000a    Arnold's work on the syntax-semantics interface is concerned with the\u000a      effective automatic analysis of natural language with a degree of accuracy\u000a      that makes it ideal for real-world applications. Many state-of-the-art\u000a      techniques are probabilistic and while robust, they do not possess the\u000a      accuracy required for sensitive applications where a high degree of\u000a      precision is required. However, because Arnold's research and expertise is\u000a      within the rule-based classical approach to NLP it is ideal for developing\u000a      `high-precision' techniques. It is this particular concern with\u000a      `high-precision' approaches, allied to practical expertise, which led BAE\u000a      Systems to ask Arnold in 2009 to act as a consultant on projects that\u000a      required detailed grammatical analysis of state-of-the-art techniques.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43966","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Hussey's research into the interrelations between French and North\u000d\u000a      African culture has been disseminated through books, newspapers, radio and\u000d\u000a      magazines, leading to enhanced public awareness of and engagement with\u000d\u000a      issues of historical and political context.

DGG is one of three novels included in Unit CY4 of the Welsh\u000a      A Level (First Language) qualification studied by 100-120 candidates per\u000a        annum. Many candidates also choose to read the text in preparation\u000a      for the synoptic element of Unit CY4. SPM is also a popular choice\u000a      in this element and is also a set text for Welsh A Level (Second\u000a      Language): it has been studied by between 450 and 570 students during the\u000a      past three years. Many candidates for AS and GCSE Welsh Literature\u000a      also choose to study stories from SPM [5.1]. The WJEC's subject\u000a      officer for Welsh explains the context for selecting DGG.\u000a      Candidates in south Wales found the northern regional dialect of Un\u000a        Nos Ola Leuad alienating, and so Morgan's text was selected to\u000a      fulfil the demand amongst candidates for an accessible modern text written\u000a      in a regional dialect of south Wales. SPM was likewise selected\u000a      for its newness and for the accessibility of its linguistic register\u000a      [5.1]. WJEC handbooks for its Welsh A Level qualifications set out the\u000a      general criteria for the inclusion of texts and authors:\u000a    `...Welsh is a subject which requires candidates to consider spiritual,\u000a      moral, ethical, social and cultural issues while reading, studying and\u000a      discussing a wide range of Welsh literature ... By encompassing a wide\u000a      range of contemporary poetry (CA3, CA6), the work of the dramatist\u000a      Saunders Lewis (CA4), the authors Mihangel Morgan and Ioan Kidd (CA5) and\u000a      the film Hedd Wyn (CA1) ... a work programme is presented which will\u000a      strengthen and enhance candidates' awareness of the Welsh language's role\u000a      ... in an European context.' [5.2]\u000a    The success with which candidates achieve these aims in relation to\u000a      Morgan's work can be heard on two CDs provided by the WJEC that exemplify\u000a      best practice for Unit CY4. Students demonstrate a sophisticated level of\u000a      understanding of the following concepts, as a result of reading DGG:\u000a      social decline, morality, Anglicisation of Welsh culture, realism and\u000a      postmodernism [5.3].\u000a    Teaching in another HEI in Wales: Morgan's work has influenced the\u000a      form and content of HEI curricula in Wales, specifically for its value as\u000a      a pedagogic tool for exploring postmodernism in Welsh literature. At the\u000a      School of Welsh, Cardiff University, Digon o Fwydod, has been part\u000a      of an undergraduate module on literary theory and criticism (CY3321;\u000a      2012-13) [5.4], and Dirgel Ddyn and TGF were taught on a\u000a      module on contemporary prose in 2008-09 (CY3951) [5.5]. The coordinator of\u000a      learning and teaching explains the rationale for including Morgan's work:\u000a    `Mihangel Morgan's work was selected as he is acknowledged as one of the\u000a      main prose writers of the present century. His poetry is studied on the\u000a      module CY3321 partly because of the use he makes of postmodern techniques.\u000a      His work is studied on the Contemporary Prose module CY3410 [2013-14] in\u000a      order to discuss his use of narrative techniques, including those\u000a      associated with postmodernism' (translated from Welsh) [5.4]\u000a      Morgan's work is also on the lifelong learning course for adult learners\u000a      (January 2013) [5.6].\u000a    Cultural Life and Public Discourse\u000a    Morgan's transition from `intriguing newcomer' to a recognized `Classic'\u000a      writer and `Welsh icon' are attested in a radio programme (`Clasuron &#8212;\u000a      Straeon Mihangel Morgan' BBC Radio Cymru 2008-08- 17) and also online\u000a      [5.7]. In terms of creativity, the novelist Owen Martell (tutored by\u000a      Morgan on the Creative Writing module in the Department of Welsh) has\u000a      recognised his debt to Morgan in a feature in The Telegraph\u000a      (11\/01\/2013) [5.8]. The impact of Morgan's work can also be measured in\u000a      terms of book sales in Wales: most of his titles are commercially\u000a      successful for his publisher, Y Lolfa. A representative of Y Lolfa states\u000a      that `Mihangel's sales are higher than is usual for books of their kind'\u000a      and `Mihangel's short stories also sell much more than volumes of stories\u000a      by other authors' (translated from Welsh) [5.9].\u000a    Morgan's work has elicited responses from a varied readership. Individual\u000a      reviewers attest the subjective effect of his fiction upon them. One\u000a      reviewer recognised the newness of the subject matter of Pantglas\u000a      in the contemporary Welsh literary canon: `Without a doubt, here is a\u000a      unique novel that deals with a difficult and sensitive subject with\u000a      respect and imagination. Once again, Mihangel Morgan has managed to fill a\u000a      void in our literature, and to widen the horizons of the Welsh novel'\u000a      (translated from Welsh) [5.10]. A student at Poznan University, reviewing\u000a      Kate Roberts a'r Ystlum for Golwg360 in 2012, demonstrates\u000a      an enhanced understanding of the intertextual dimension of Morgan's work\u000a      and the depth of the research underpinning his fiction [5.11]. Simliarly,\u000a      a blogger noted the personal literary echoes that she perceived in\u000a      Morgan's work whilst reviewing Christopher Meredith's English translation\u000a      of Melog [5.12]. One reviewer also understood the impact of Pantglas\u000a      in generating awareness of the forgotten history of Llanwddyn: he is\u000a      quoted on the Welsh Book Council's website: `As far as I know, this\u000a      is the first time ever that the history of drowning the valley has been\u000a      used as the basis of a Welsh novel. But the novel is so much more than\u000a      that too. It testifies to the way in which Welsh communities were exploded\u000a      and exploited during the past century and a half (translated from Welsh)\u000a      [5.14]. Blog Glyn Adda (7\/05\/2012) stresses the newness of information in\u000a      Kate Roberts a'r Ystlum and how its alternative readings force\u000a      readers to reconsider their received opinion of familiar characters and\u000a      events [5.14]. The editorial team underwent this very experience during\u000a      the production process of Kate Roberts a'r Ystlum: `several of\u000a      Mihangel's inspiring and different portraits of some of the big names in\u000a      Welsh literature had changed our image of them' (translated from Welsh)\u000a      [5.9].\u000a    Morgan's fiction has been popular with a variety of reading groups\u000a      throughout Wales. Pantglas featured on reading lists in Wales,\u000a      London and Patagonia. The blog of a London reading group attests its\u000a      impact on their understanding of the Victorian dam-building project and\u000a      also the later, more politically sensitive project at Tryweryn in 1965;\u000a      they compared the novel with books on Tryweryn and discussed the different\u000a      mindset of the novels' Victorian setting [5.15]. Further afield, two\u000a      reading groups in Patagonia read Pantglas: Gaiman (6 members) and\u000a      Trelew (4 members). The coordinator notes that the novel gave readers `a\u000a      different view' of the history of Welsh reservoirs that extended beyond\u000a      the familiar political narratives of Tryweryn and Cwm Celyn: `as we read\u000a      the novel our understanding of the situation was deepened' (translated\u000a      from Welsh) [5.16]. The related blog also reveals that the Gwentian\u000a      dialect was a challenging new experience for members of these reading\u000a      groups [5.17].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study considers the impact since 1 January 2008 of Mihangel\u000a      Morgan's creative writing outputs.

Heralded `the most intriguing newcomer on the literary\u000a      scene' by the critic John Rowlands, he has since then, not only increased\u000a      the corpus of self-consciously postmodern Welsh-language fiction, but has\u000a      also enriched its texture. Through the practice of postmodern literary\u000a      techniques in his writing he has significantly changed the landscape of\u000a      Welsh literature and literary criticism. The underpinning research in\u000a      works cited in section 3 comprises experimentation with postmodernist\u000a      techniques (including deliberate fictionality, parody and playfulness),\u000a      the subversion of narrative and moral expectation, and proposing\u000a      alternatives to the accepted narratives and canonical readings of Welsh\u000a      literary history. These works also explore the possibilities of\u000a      intertextuality (largely drawn from Classic cinema, as well as Welsh and\u000a      European literature) and investigate challenging themes of otherness and\u000a      difference, mainly in terms of sexuality, mental health and social\u000a      exclusion. As a result, Morgan has been compared to the Argentine\u000a      experimental novelist Jorge Luis Borges and the Irish novelist Brian\u000a      O'Nolan (Flann O'Brien). Furthermore, the outputs listed in section 3 have\u000a      made a considerable contribution to an emerging canon of Welsh &#8212; and\u000a      Welsh-language &#8212; gay literature. Morgan's work has also proved\u000a      groundbreaking in the prominence that it affords the neglected regional\u000a      dialect of Glamorgan and Gwent (Gwenhwyseg). By eschewing the\u000a      abstruse conceptual vocabulary associated with theoretical exegesis and\u000a      instead illustrating the revisionist agenda of his research through\u000a      fictional characters, scenarios and possibilities, Morgan affords readers\u000a      of his work a more nuanced understanding of the Welsh postmodernist and\u000a      postcolonial condition.\u000a    Morgan was granted study leave during the academic year 2008-09 to write\u000a      Pantglas [3.8].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44018","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    (Figures in brackets e.g. `[1]' cross-refer to Section 5)\u000a    The monographs are widely disseminated (cf. http:\/\/copac.ac.uk),\u000a      and the total number of subscribers to the journal has reached 680\u000a      individuals and 311 institutions, far more than other Celtic Studies\u000a      journal.

CMCS was one of only two Celtic\u000a      journals placed by the European Science Foundation's European Reference\u000a      Index for the Humanities (2007, 2011) in its top `INT1' category for\u000a      Literature &#8212; INT1 denotes `International publications with high visibility\u000a      and influence among researchers in the various research domains in\u000a      different countries, regularly cited all over the world'.[1]\u000a    Contribution to Cultural Life\u000a      While CMCS's impact within HE, including on teaching and students, extends\u000a      throughout the world, there is also an appreciative lay readership. One\u000a      subscriber wrote: `I am not an academic &#8212; my working life was in central\u000a      banking, however I have found many CMCS articles fascinating and\u000a      admirable, and they have gone a long way to satisfying my general\u000a      curiosity about all things Celtic).[2] The Foundation for Inspirational\u000a      &amp; Oracular Studies, London, noted that `The impact of CMCS\u000a      goes far beyond universities and its research inspires many ordinary\u000a      readers whose love of Celtic Britain and medieval matters cannot be\u000a      sated',[2] and Haycock's Legendary Poems from the Book of Taliesin\u000a      (2007), which will be reprinted in 2014, led to widespread interest\u000a      outside conventional academia, e.g. the Temenos Academy in 2009, and to an\u000a      invitation to present a dayschool at the Bleddfa Centre in July 2013.[3]\u000a      In 2009 a draft online version of Falileyev's Dictionary of\u000a        Continental Celtic Place-Names had more hits than any other academic\u000a      item in Aberystwyth University's electronic repository Cadair and\u000a      its accompanying map was downloaded 350 times in the year up to July\u000a      2013.[5] It and the other CMCS monographs on Ancient Celtic attracted\u000a      particular interest in Eastern Europe, e.g., collaboration in an open\u000a      meeting in the Bulgarian National Archaeological Institute and Museum in\u000a      2010 (Aberystwyth University `being an important centre of Celtic\u000a      Studies'), followed by requests to help with a Celtic tourist centre in\u000a      Bulgaria.[6] Sims-Williams's CMCS article in linking the Llywarch\u000a      Hen poems and Llan-gors (see 2. above) led to an invitation to address the\u000a      Powysland Club in 2011 and a request by a Heritage Lottery Fund\u000a      partnership project between `Head4Arts' and the National Museum of Wales\u000a      to assist with the libretto for Ynys Gwydr: Island of Glass, an\u000a      opera about Llan-gors featuring Llywarch [7, 9, 10]. The opera was staged\u000a      in Merthyr Tudful and the Wales Millennium Centre 12-20 April 2013. The\u000a      project aimed to raise public engagement with an `elist' artform, to\u000a      increase the community's sense of ownership of its heritage, and to add to\u000a      cultural regeneration, and was deemed a great success [7,8].\u000a    Influence on HE curricula beyond Aberystwyth\u000a      CMCS's influence on HE curricula is illustrated by the Bibliography of\u000a        medieval Welsh literature for students, which has 177\u000a      journal-citations for 1993-2011, of which 52 (29%) are to CMCS,\u000a      the most cited journal, followed by Studia Celtica with 23\u000a      (13%).[11] Sims-Williams's 1998 CMCS article `Celtomania and\u000a      Celtoscepticism' (cited in 2.), was particularly influential on the\u000a      development of the discipline, partly via its reprinting in a volume on Critical\u000a        Concepts in Historical Studies (ed. R. Karl &amp; D. Stifter). It\u000a      was abridged in a Russian magazine in 2008 (`Kel'tomanija i\u000a      Kel'toskepticizm', Neprikosnovennyj zapas [Moscow], 57 (2008),\u000a      179-91), and praised as `wonderful, one of the most balanced views of the\u000a      problems at hand' in the inaugural lecture of the Professor of Celtic\u000a      Studies at the University of Sydney in 2008 [12]. It introduced the now\u000a      widespread term Celtoscepticism\/Celtoskepticism to the English\u000a      language, copied as Celto-scepticisme in French.[13] Thus a new\u000a      Celtic Studies MA course at Bangor (2013) considers `What are the\u000a      strengths and weaknesses of \"Celtomania\" and \"Celtoscepticism\"?'.[14] The\u000a      article is one of several CMCS items (cf. 2. above) much used in HE;\u000a      according to a professor in the Humboldt University, Berlin:\u000a    `In teaching Celtic Studies to students in Germany, Sims-Williams's\u000a      article Celtomania and Celtoscepticism (1998) has become a\u000a      standard starting point that introduces beginners to complicated issues in\u000a      a competent and unbiassed way. Rodway's discussion of The date and\u000a        authorship of Culhwch ac Olwen (2005) is a must for every class\u000a      approaching this important Welsh text, as is Haycock's Taliesin's\u000a        Questions (1997) for graduates. The admirable readiness to take up\u000a      challenges for teaching and research in the field of Celtic is perhaps\u000a      most evident in the monograph series. The volumes by Raybould &amp;\u000a      Sims-Williams on Continental Celtic personal names (2007 and 2009), with\u000a      English translations and helpful comments, make it possible for the first\u000a      time to present the evidence of Latin inscriptions to undergraduates.'[2]\u000a    Another HE appreciation of CMCS comes from the &#201;cole Pratique des\u000a      Hautes &#201;tudes, Paris:\u000a    `As a teacher of Celtic languages, I found this journal full of resources\u000a      .... Some contributions from the editor address central questions in\u000a      Celtic Studies (1998, 2012); this is, in a way, a re-foundation of Celtic\u000a      Studies'.[2]\u000a    The importance for HE of the CMCS 2012 contribution here\u000a      mentioned (Sims-Williams, `Celtic\u000a    Civilization: Continuity or Coincidence?') is also praised by a teacher\u000a      in the USA:\u000a    `Sims-Williams' extraordinary article on \"Celtic Civilization\" leaves one\u000a      breathless. Forty-four densely packed pages with oodles of footnoted\u000a      references&#8212;really a summary of Celtic studies scholarship published over\u000a      the past 25 years or more. This is a model of scholarly research at its\u000a      best. I will again be teaching the retired\/adult-learner class on a Celtic\u000a      topic, and of course I will share the article with them&#8212;truly it will be a\u000a      kind of ice-breaker for the students, to bring into focus the breadth and\u000a      depth of this important area of humanistic research' [2].\u000a    Another note:\u000a    `I have just started teaching here at Belmont Abbey College in North\u000a      Carolina and already CMCS has been making an impact on my\u000a      students, especially the recent research from Clarke, Rodway and Bisagni\u000a      on the origins of Leprechauns [CMCS 2010-12]. Leprechauns are far\u000a      more prevalent in American culture today than they ever were in Ireland so\u000a      the topic was a good way to introduce a range of ideas &#8212; including early\u000a      Irish scholarship and the blending of local and Christian ideas sometimes\u000a      found therein &#8212; in my course on Early Christian Ireland' [2].\u000a    Similarly a professor from the Netherlands comments:\u000a    `As CMCS is written in an accessible language and offers a\u000a      platform to young scholars, it is an important source of inspiration for\u000a      the student generation ...

It succeeded in its aim of bringing accessibly edited,\u000a      quality research on medieval Celtic culture to a much broader readership\u000a      than previous journals in Wales. It is read by students and amateurs, and\u000a      articles in it by members of the Department have shaped HE curricula\u000a      worldwide; for example, Sims-Williams's `Celtomania and Celtoscepticism' (CMCS\u000a      1998), described as `the best analysis of \"the Celtic war\"' at the\u000a      Belgisch Genootschap voor Keltische Studies (http:\/\/users.telenet.be\/herman.clerinx\/grand-celtic-story.html),\u000a      first disseminated the term `Celtoscepticism' which now features in most\u000a      discussions of the Celts. His influential sequel in CMCS 2012,\u000a      `Celtic Civilization: Continuity or Coincidence?', questioned further\u000a      orthodoxies. Between 1993 and July 2013 eight members of staff published\u000a      21 articles in CMCS, reflecting their original research [the\u000a      figures e.g. `(3.2)' refer to supporting grants listed in Section 3]: John\u000a      Reuben Davies (3.2), Alexander Falileyev, Marged Haycock, Graham Isaac,\u000a      Helen McKee (3.2, 3.6), Richard Glyn Roberts (3.14), Simon Rodway, and\u000a      Patrick Sims-Williams. One article, by Jon Coe, `Dating the Boundary\u000a      Clauses in the Book of Llandaf', CMCS 2004, was based on a 2001\u000a      PhD in the Department, funded by the British Academy's Humanities Research\u000a      Board and the Oxford University Rhys Fund; it revealed significant\u000a      evidence for Welsh border historians. In the same geographical area,\u000a      Sims-Williams's CMCS 1993 article `The Provenance of the Llywarch\u000a      Hen Poems: A Case for Llan-gors, Brycheiniog' established the link that\u000a      was soon accepted by historians and archaeologists (e.g. www.herwales.co.uk\/her\/groups\/CPAT\/media\/reports\/CPAT%20764.pdf).\u000a      Other articles on Welsh literature which opened new phases of debate\u000a      included Marged Haycock, `Taliesin's Questions' in CMCS 1997\u000a      (revealing the Latin background to the poems) and Simon Rodway, `The Date\u000a      and Authorship of Culhwch ac Olwen: A Reassessment' in CMCS\u000a      2005 (on reaction to this article see idem, Dating Medieval Welsh\u000a        Literature, 2013). Rodway also started a long-running debate about\u000a      the origin of leprechauns in `Mermaids, Leprechauns, and Fomorians: A\u000a      Middle Irish Account of the Descendants of Cain', CMCS 2010. These\u000a      are just a few examples.\u000a    In 1996, as `CMCS Publications', Sims-Williams began publishing books as\u000a      well, all of them by members of the Department. These had the same aim as\u000a      the journal but covered a wider chronological range, disseminating the\u000a      staff's fundamental research on the language and literature of the\u000a      Celtic-speaking peoples from as far back as 500 B.C., but also reaching\u000a      post-medieval times: the first volume (1996), which won the Katharine\u000a      Briggs Folklore Award, was M.-A. Constantine's Breton Ballads\u000a      (3.1). (References in brackets e.g. `3.2' again refer to competitively\u000a      awarded research grants; these indicate the academic quality of the books,\u000a      as does their submission in successive RAEs and REF 2014.)\u000a    After Breton Ballads, CMCS monographs between 1996 and\u000a      2013 published much original new research on evidence for linguistic\u000a      Celticity in ancient Europe, as revealed by place- and personal names (for\u000a      all titles see 3.). The first was Sims-Williams (joint ed.), Ptolemy:\u000a        Towards a Linguistic Atlas of the Earliest Celtic Place-Names of Europe\u000a      (3.4), including chapters on Wales and Ireland by Sims-Williams, Toner\u000a      &amp; De Bernardo Stempel, 3 members of the UoA; this led to a series of\u000a      successful volumes on place-names, culminating with Alexander Falileyev's\u000a      Dictionary of Continental Celtic Place-Names (3.7). Three works on\u000a      ancient Celtic personal names were published by Marilynne E. Raybould\u000a      &amp; Patrick Sims-Williams, mapping their Europe-wide distribution for\u000a      the first time (3.9, 3.10), while Falileyev combined place- and personal\u000a      names in studies of Celtic Dacia (3.12) and The Celtic Balkans\u000a      (3.13).\u000a    From 2000 books on Welsh language &amp; literature were published: Helen\u000a      McKee's books on the ninth-century Juvencus manuscript glossed in Welsh,\u000a      Irish and Latin (3.2, 3.5, 3.6), Marged Haycock's editions of poems from\u000a      the Book of Taliesin (3.3, 3.11), Simon Rodway's Dating Medieval Welsh\u000a        Literature (3.14) and Richard Glyn Roberts's edition of the proverbs\u000a      in the Red Book of Hergest, Diarhebion Llyfr Coch Hergest (2013).\u000a    All authors named above were on the staff of the UoA at the time. Nearly\u000a      all these works were based on externally funded research, as indicated by\u000a      figures in brackets which refer to Section 3.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44021","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The AND has had an impact on three major groups: professional bodies, the\u000d\u000a      media, and the public.

WalesOnline registered the Prix Honor&#233; Chav&#233;e in 2011 (5.7).\u000d\u000a    Trotter's related public activities have included: making an audio\u000d\u000a      recording of an excerpt of the Chanson de Roland for an\u000d\u000a      audiovisual display at Battle Abbey Museum; supplying a translation and\u000d\u000a      reading of an Anglo-Norman document describing the death of Llywelyn ap\u000d\u000a      Gruffudd in 1282 for the National Museum of Wales's `Voices from Medieval\u000d\u000a      Wales' (5.8); involvement as an invited expert for a National Geographic\u000d\u000a      `Mystery Files' film made in Venice in 2010 and shown in the UK in June\u000d\u000a      2011 (5.9).\u000d\u000a    Members of the public are clearly aware of the AND and have often &#8212; after\u000d\u000a      using the Dictionary - addressed supplementary enquiries to the editors.\u000d\u000a      In November 2010, the Vice-Chancellor and Librarian of Lincoln Cathedral\u000d\u000a      enquired about a word in a 1319 Lincoln will (5.10).

We also receive a steady trickle of enquiries from members of the\u000d\u000a      public, in particular interested in their family names where these appear\u000d\u000a      to be of Anglo-Norman origin.\u000d\u000a    With the advent of the `Pathways to Impact' element within AHRC grants,\u000d\u000a      the project is committed to developing its impact-generating activities\u000d\u000a      over the period 2012-2016.

From 2003 to 2012 there\u000d\u000a      have been two PDRAs (Virginie Derrien and Geert De Wilde [2003-2008];\u000d\u000a      Derrien now replaced by Heather Pagan, 2008-) working as full-time\u000d\u000a      assistant editors under Trotter's direction; in 2013. Katariina Nara\u000d\u000a      joined the project for a two-year (2013-2015) post concentrating on\u000d\u000a      revision of semantic labelling and the introduction of references to other\u000d\u000a      dictionaries. Natasha Romanova completed a related project on National\u000d\u000a      Archives documents, and Jennifer Gabel (jointly funded by the AHRC and the\u000d\u000a      Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in a shared Aberystwyth\/Heidelberg\u000d\u000a      project) was in Aberystwyth in 2011, working on the AND part-time and\u000d\u000a      producing an edition of an Anglo-Norman text for a Freiburg doctorate. The\u000d\u000a      AND is based on rigorous, primary, new research on original texts, both\u000d\u000a      printed and (increasingly) in electronic format. It involves finding and\u000d\u000a      using quotations from upwards of (now) 900 texts and documents, and the\u000d\u000a      synthesis of this into coherent, organized articles, each of which is in\u000d\u000a      effect an account of the meanings of a word in Anglo-Norman across 400\u000d\u000a      years of the language's existence in the British Isles. The AND &#8212; because\u000d\u000a      of the evidence it has brought to light -- has enabled a complete rethink\u000d\u000a      of the relationship between English and French in the British Isles in the\u000d\u000a      Middle Ages (3.4; 3.5). We now understand far better how Anglo-Norman\u000d\u000a      interacted with Anglo-Saxon to produce Middle English. A proper account of\u000d\u000a      the vocabulary of Anglo-Norman is clearly a prerequisite for such a\u000d\u000a      reconsideration, whose implications impinge, ultimately, on all speakers\u000d\u000a      of English. The underlying research behind the AND (much of which has also\u000d\u000a      been expanded on in the form of a series of scholarly articles by Rothwell\u000d\u000a      and Trotter) is primary lexicographical research on raw data in the form\u000d\u000a      of a) collected illustrative quotation-slips b) digitized texts searched\u000d\u000a      by concordancing software c) the reading of published and in some cases\u000d\u000a      unpublished texts and documents d) the integration of our work into\u000d\u000a      international lexicographical and philological work on medieval French in\u000d\u000a      its various forms (3.3).\u000d\u000a    The continuing importance of Anglo-Norman as an element in English, and\u000d\u000a      in particular as a source of legal vocabulary up until the present day,\u000d\u000a      means that this research is relevant to a much wider audience than that of\u000d\u000a      academics specializing in medieval languages. We have a varied readership\u000d\u000a      ranging from world experts in medieval French to interested members of the\u000d\u000a      public in the UK and abroad. This was one reason for developing an online\u000d\u000a      Dictionary &#8212; and for not charging for, or otherwise restricting, access.\u000d\u000a      The position we have adopted has always been that the taxpayer has funded\u000d\u000a      the entirety of our work and should therefore be allowed and indeed\u000d\u000a      encouraged to use it (see the statement at http:\/\/www.anglo-norman.net\/dissem\/data\/intro.htm).\u000a      The launch of the site was publicized and featured, for example, in the\u000d\u000a      AMARC (Association for Manuscripts and Archives in Research Collections)\u000d\u000a      newsletter no. 47 (5.1), and in the Guildhall Library Manuscripts Section\u000d\u000a      online newsletter (5.2). In 2006 the project was allocated &#163;10,500 of\u000d\u000a      extra `pilot dissemination study' funding by AHRC and produced both the\u000d\u000a      section of the website `for non-specialist visitors' to which this link\u000d\u000a      refers, and a CD-ROM of materials, which was sent to around a thousand\u000d\u000a      schools and colleges. The intention was to provide material of use\u000d\u000a      (specifically) in English language A-level courses, and perhaps for\u000d\u000a      history teaching. The CD contained an explanation of why the AND is\u000d\u000a      needed; an overview of how the Dictionary came into being, and how it is\u000d\u000a      developed, maintained and extended. We went on to show some of the maybe\u000d\u000a      unexpected ways and places that Anglo-Norman has survived in vulgarities\u000d\u000a      and dialect expressions, before moving on to look at perhaps the most\u000d\u000a      famous and important document in Anglo-Norman: Magna Carta. Then we look\u000d\u000a      at the abiding Anglo-Norman presence in the present day language of food\u000d\u000a      and cooking, and some of the ways Chaucer brought Anglo-Norman words into\u000d\u000a      the mainstream of English literature and language. Finally, we illustrate\u000d\u000a      from a documented complaint about offensive stenches in the City of London\u000d\u000a      what we mean by saying that medieval England was 'multilingual', and show\u000d\u000a      the place of Anglo-Norman in the multilingual mix. Because Anglo-Norman\u000d\u000a      existed in a multilingual environment (which Rothwell and Trotter have\u000d\u000a      done much to explain to the scholarly world: 3.4; 3.5), we also look\u000d\u000a      routinely at medieval Latin and Middle English. In parallel with the\u000d\u000a      Dictionary itself, 78 texts and 9 academic articles by Rothwell have been\u000d\u000a      digitized and put online, as a related but separately-funded project in\u000d\u000a      Swansea (dir. Andrew Rothwell). In addition to the AND itself (which since\u000d\u000a      2003 has completely revised F-N, A-E being completed from 1989\/90 to\u000d\u000a      publication in 2005), the editors have produced well over sixty academic\u000d\u000a      articles (predominantly Rothwell and Trotter) and delivered 100 or so\u000d\u000a      papers\/invited lectures on subjects related to the AND in fourteen\u000d\u000a      countries. Key conferences have been organized in Aberystwyth on\u000d\u000a      multilingualism (1997) and medieval French lexicography (2011);\u000d\u000a      proceedings have in both cases been published. The AND's research findings\u000d\u000a      have thus been disseminated and promoted by parallel scholarly activity\u000d\u000a      (e.g. 3.5; 3.6).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44022","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dr Hammel has integrated the findings of the Kindertransport 1938\/39: New\u000a      Perspectives project\u000a      into different interdisciplinary frameworks and has engaged with a wide\u000a      variety of different\u000a      audiences in the UK and internationally.\u000a    Discussing the topic of the Kindertransport in different\u000a      interdisciplinary contexts as well as with\u000a      different stakeholder groups is an important way to support and challenge\u000a      processes of\u000a      commemoration, memorialisation and reconciliation. Below are examples of\u000a      impact aimed at\u000a      different groups:\u000a    4.1 Stakeholder group: the Jewish community:\u000a      In February 2011, Andrea Hammel gave a public talk together with former\u000a      Kindertransportee Ruth\u000a      David at the Wiener Library London on David's memoirs (related to 3.3).\u000a      The audience of ca. 50\u000a      people consisted mainly of members of the Jewish community and other\u000a      members of the general\u000a      public. The discussion focussed on the Kindertransport, memoir writing and\u000a      translating life stories.\u000a      It sparked a lively debate between academics and stakeholders about\u000a      authenticity and memory.\u000a    4.2 Stakeholder: an individual Kindertransportee: In November\u000a      2011, Andrea Hammel acted as a\u000a      consultant for a memoir project by former Kindertransportee Susi Bech&#246;fer.\u000a      They discussed\u000a      Bech&#246;fer's life story as well as her personal archival material in view of\u000a      commonly held\u000a      assumptions regarding Kindertransport stories. Bech&#246;fer's story is an\u000a      extraordinary one and it has\u000a      been appropriated outside her control several times. Hammel advised on a\u000a      suitable co-writer for\u000a      such an autobiographical project.\u000a    4.3 Stakeholder group: the general public: In March 2012, Hammel\u000a      organized a talk by former\u000a      Kindertransportee William Dieneman at Aberystwyth University as well as\u000a      the exhibition `Double\u000a      Exposure: Jewish Refugees from Austria in Britain' at the Aberystwyth Arts\u000a      Centre. The talk\u000a      attracted an audience of over 100 people and the special viewing attracted\u000a      over 80 participants\u000a      and a subsequent feedback questionnaire showed the positive impact of this\u000a      venture on a diverse\u000a      audience ranging in age from 9 to 83. The above event featured in the\u000a      digital media and in the\u000a      local newspaper, the Cambrian News ('Jewish man who fled the Nazis to talk\u000a      about his\u000a      experiences', Thursday, 15 March 2012, Cambrian News; 5.2). Feedback\u000a      questionnaires\u000a      confirmed that this event changed the thinking of audience members of\u000a      various ages relating to\u000a      migration and refugees as well as refugees and the history of the 1930s\u000a      and 1940s: `I think that\u000a      stories like this are relevant today as they indicate both how Britain has\u000a      a long tradition of taking\u000a      refugees in and how refugees make a contribution to British life (Male,\u000a      46); `Made me consider the\u000a      different types of immigration and that they are a lot of immigrants that\u000a      don't fit the stereotypes'\u000a      (Female, 39) (5.6).\u000a    The town community of Aberystwyth clearly appreciated this opportunity to\u000a      discuss these issues as\u000a      there are not at the forefront of cultural life of the town, but it became\u000a      clear that they are still\u000a      significant for the audience. In January 2013, Hammel gave a talk on the\u000a      Kindertransport at the\u000a      Aberystwyth Branch of the University of the Third Age (U3A). Feedback\u000a      questionnaires show that\u000a      the talk inspired many members of the audience to think about their own\u000a      experiences during World\u000a      War 2. A number of them remembered contacts with former refugees and\u000a      Kindertransportees: `I\u000a      found the talk very interesting, particularly as I have had friends who\u000a      came to the UK by train as\u000a      refugees.' (5.4). They also stated that it provided new knowledge (`The\u000a      lecture widened my\u000a      understanding of the pre-war, post-war period.' 5.4) and inspired some\u000a      participants to do further\u000a      research (the talk `made me want to learn more and read new information'\u000a      5.4).\u000a    In July 2013 Dr Hammel gave a presentation to a group of 16 to 18-year\u000a      olds taking Sociology and\u000a      Psychology AS level at Penglais Secondary School in Aberystwyth to enhance\u000a      their learning\u000a      experience in relation to issues of childhood, attachment and separation:\u000a      `Andrea's talk provided\u000a      [the students] with a prompt to consider and empathise with the suffering\u000a      of others [...] I have no\u000a      doubt that her talk made a significant impact and will use it as a\u000a      reference point throughout the\u000a      year.' (5.5).\u000a    4.4 Stakeholder group: Kindertransportees and their descendants,\u000a        mainly USA: Hammel was\u000a      invited to give a keynote presentation at the Conference of the North\u000a      American Kindertransport\u000a      Association (KTA) in November 2012 in Los Angeles. The North American KTA\u000a      is an organisation\u000a      of former child refugees and their descendants and the event was attended\u000a      by over 130 people\u000a      (5.7). This presentation was followed by a workshop co-facilitated by\u000a      Hammel in which ca. 40\u000a      participants were able to discuss points made in the presentation and\u000a      raise questions' There is\u000a      email and social media evidence that the talk had a profound effect on a\u000a      number of participants:\u000a      `your presentation was most informative, and helped me as a Kind Second\u000a      Generation understand\u000a      the path that my mother travelled from Cologne to England in 1938.' (5.3)\u000a    Hammel's research finding regarding the differing intentions of the\u000a      parents in Continental Europe\u000a      and the UK government received attention from the audience after the\u000a      presentation. During the\u000a      workshop the question of how the children for the transports were chosen\u000a      sparked lively debate\u000a      (5.8).\u000a    4.5 Stakeholder group: Kindertransportees and their descendants,\u000a        mainly UK: In June 2013 the\u000a      findings of the Kindertransport 1938\/39: New Perspectives project were\u000a      presented at the\u000a      Kindertransport Symposium in London. This event was part of the\u000a      Association of Jewish Refugee's\u000a      commemoration events celebrating the 75th anniversary of the\u000a      Kindertransport. The event was\u000a      attended by 97 people of varying ages and the question of Kindertransport\u000a      stories and the\u000a      ownership of the narrative sparked lively and extensive discussions (5.6).\u000a    It is thus clear that the Kindertransport: New Perspectives project\u000a      challenged processes of\u000a      commemoration, memorialisation and reconciliation within a number of\u000a      different stakeholder\u000a      groups by presenting new research findings at public events in the UK and\u000a      the US. The lively\u000a      debates encountered at these events shows that the Kindertransport remains\u000a      highly topical in the\u000a      21st century.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Kindertransport was the movement to rescue 10,000 mainly Jewish\u000a      children from Germany,\u000a      Austria and Czechoslovakia and bring them to the UK in 1938\/39. This\u000a      project focusses on archival\u000a      research as well as qualitative social research to reassess aspects of the\u000a      Kindertransport. The aim\u000a      of this project was to influence public discourse and civil society and to\u000a      provide new perspectives\u000a      to stakeholders such as the former Kindertransportees themselves, both in\u000a      the UK and abroad, the\u000a      Jewish community and the interested public in general.\u000a    The research is being disseminated through public events, the media and\u000a      publications. The focus\u000a      of the Kindertransport: New Perspectives project was to revise common\u000a      assumption and introduce\u000a      new critical perspectives regarding the commemoration, memorialisation and\u000a      reconciliation of the\u000a      Kindertransport to different groups of people.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Aberystwyth University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Aberystwyth University","InstitutionName":"Aberystwyth University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Wales","UKPRN":10007856}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2657782","Name":"Aberystwyth"},{"GeoNamesId":"2886242","Name":"Köln"},{"GeoNamesId":"5368361","Name":"Los Angeles"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1 Andrea Hammel was awarded a grant by the British Academy (March 2010\u000a      to Feb. 2012).\u000a    \u000a\u000a3.2 Andrea Hammel was awarded a grant by the New York-based Claims\u000a      conference to support\u000a      this project (February 2011 to January 2013).\u000a    \u000a\u000a3.3 Andrea Hammel, 'Authenticity, Trauma and the Child's View: Martha\u000a      Blend's A Child Alone,\u000a      Vera Gissing's Pearls of Childhood and Ruth L.

She is a Committee Member of the Research Centre for German and\u000a      Austrian Exile\u000a      Studies, IGRS, University of London Since 2010 she was elected a member of\u000a      the executive of the\u000a      Deutsche Gesellschaft f&#252;r Exilforschung and was appointed to the Academic\u000a      Steering Committee\u000a      of the Study Group for the Forced Migration of Children, Victoria\u000a      University of Wellington, New\u000a      Zealand.\u000a    For the Kindertransport 1938\/39: New Perspectives Project (see Reference\u000a      to Research 3.1) Dr\u000a      Hammel interviewed Kindertransportees and their descendants and carried\u000a      out archival research\u000a      at the Wiener Library, the Imperial War Museum in London, and the John\u000a      Rylands Library at the\u000a      University of Manchester as well as at the Jewish History Centre, New\u000a      York; at the Deutsche\u000a      Literaturarchiv Marbach; at the Central Archives for the History of the\u000a      Jewish People, the Central\u000a      Zionist Archives and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem; at the Dioz&#246;searchiv des\u000a      Bistums Berlin, the\u000a      Zentrum fuer Antisemitismusforschung and the Deutsche Bundesarchiv in\u000a      Berlin; and at the\u000a      USHMM Archive, Washington DC (supported by grants, see 3.1).\u000a    The research findings are manifold:\u000a    a. Dr Hammel's research confirms that there was no obvious bias when\u000a      choosing individual\u000a      children for the transports from German, Austria and Czechoslovakia,\u000a      although there might\u000a      have been an implicit pre-selection as it was mainly the children's own\u000a      parents who signed\u000a      them up for transports and parents from certain backgrounds were more\u000a      likely to do so than\u000a      others (see 3.5)\u000a    b. In recent years more focus has been placed on the attitude of the\u000a      Continental parents who\u000a      let their children come to the UK unaccompanied and the attitude of the\u000a      British government\u000a      who were determined to admit only unaccompanied children. This goes hand\u000a      in hand with a\u000a      general evaluation of the British government's intention and policy\u000a      decisions. Hammel's\u000a      research has shown that there was a discrepancy between the efforts of the\u000a      parents to use\u000a      the Kindertransport to keep families together (by trying to place children\u000a      on the\u000a      Kindertransport and at the same time by trying to get domestic servant\u000a      permits for adult\u000a      family members) and the UK government's intention to only allow\u000a      unaccompanied minors\u000a      (as they were considered to generate more sympathy in the British public\u000a      and to constitute\u000a      no competition in the British labour market) (see 3.4).\u000a    c. A comparative investigation of the memorialisation processes regarding\u000a      the Kindertransport\u000a      is needed: is the Kindertransport considered a safe topic compared with\u000a      the Holocaust? Is\u000a      this problematic? In what way is the narrative directed by various\u000a      stakeholders? Which\u000a      stories are told and which are neglected? (see 3.3)\u000a    d. Hardly any work so far has been carried out regarding the Reunion of\u000a      Kindertransport\u000a      Movement and the Second Generation groups. These groups and bodies have a\u000a      significant\u000a      influence on the memorialisation of the Kindertransport and Andrea Hammel\u000a      has instigated\u000a      research in this area.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44184","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    From the outset, researchers formed a close link with the Basque Children\u000d\u000a      of `37 Association, which contributed its archive to the University\u000d\u000a      Library. The collaboration culminated in May 2012 in a two-day event\u000d\u000a      commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Ni&#241;os'\u000d\u000a      arrival in Southampton. Around 100 people attended the event, the\u000d\u000a      highlight of which was the launch of a book co-authored by Pozo-Guti&#233;rrez\u000d\u000a      and Broomfield, \"Here, look after him\": Voices of Basque Evacuee\u000d\u000a        Children of the Spanish Civil War. The event provoked strong\u000d\u000a      reactions even in those who had no family ties to the Ni&#241;os. One\u000d\u000a      member of the public commented: \"To be able to listen and to speak to\u000d\u000a      people who had either been evacuees themselves or children of evacuees,\u000d\u000a      and through the films to understand something of what they had to go\u000d\u000a      through, was unforgettable\". Another attendee remarked on the gap in\u000d\u000a      public knowledge around the Spanish Civil War and the evacuation. After\u000d\u000a      the event, Pozo-Guti&#233;rrez received a number of emails from\u000d\u000a      second-generation descendants of the Ni&#241;os, as well as students\u000d\u000a      and researchers who had been influenced or inspired by the project and\u000d\u000a      book [5.1].\u000d\u000a    Throughout the project, researchers gave talks to audiences of up to 40\u000d\u000a      at local community groups including Hampshire Archives and Southampton\u000d\u000a      Arts and Heritage, and impact was sustained through a space in\u000d\u000a      Southampton's new SeaCity Museum (visited by 140,000 people April 2012 &#8212;\u000d\u000a      April 2013 [5.2]). Talks at international events, including a\u000d\u000a      UNESCO colloquium in Paris, extended the impact beyond the UK. An\u000d\u000a      unexpected consequence of the colloquium showed how the research helped to\u000d\u000a      put the marginal voices of war children on the research agenda: when the\u000d\u000a      UNESCO Turkish delegation protested at the display of children's drawings\u000d\u000a      of the Armenian genocide, President Nicolas Sarkozy defied protestors to\u000d\u000a      announce that denial of the persecutions was to be an offence.\u000d\u000a    Researchers also participated in a travelling public exhibition, with\u000d\u000a      venues including the University of Zaragoza; University of Las Palmas de\u000d\u000a      Gran Canaria; Southampton Solent University; and Hampshire Records Office\u000d\u000a      [5.3]. In May 2012 an electronic version of the exhibition was made\u000d\u000a      available on the University Library's Special Collections webpage [5.4].\u000d\u000a      A user commented: \"With Libya and now Syria suffering from civil war, the\u000d\u000a      project is hugely significant not just for the ni&#241;os and maestras\u000d\u000a      but also as a lesson for the future to us all\" [5.5].\u000d\u000a    The project has inspired several documentary films, bringing the\u000d\u000a      experiences of the Basque children to wider and younger audiences and\u000d\u000a      enabling new generations to make relevant connections with contemporary\u000d\u000a      debates on immigration. Directed by Matt Richards, To Say Goodbye\u000d\u000a      is an animated documentary film featuring voice recordings collected\u000d\u000a      during the research. It was released at San Sebastian Film Festival in\u000d\u000a      September 2012 and has been shown in 16 towns and cities in Spain. It has\u000d\u000a      been selected for four international film festivals, including the London\u000d\u000a      Spanish Film Festival, and has been nominated for two awards. During the\u000d\u000a      making of the film a Facebook page acted as a platform to engage with a\u000d\u000a      second and third generation of descendants [5.6]. The forum proved\u000d\u000a      extremely popular and allowed members to participate in the May 2012\u000d\u000a      symposium via Skype. Following the film's release Pozo-Guti&#233;rrez and\u000d\u000a      producer Izaskun Arandia were interviewed by the regional BBC news team.\u000d\u000a      Arandia said: \"The [children] that returned by 1939 got more recognition\u000d\u000a      than those who didn't come back &#8212; now with this film they finally get that\u000d\u000a      recognition. The interviews are the core, the backbone of the film. If it\u000d\u000a      wasn't for Alicia's research there would be no film\" [5.7].

It was released in 2008 and is available on\u000d\u000a      various online sites, such as Vimeo [5.8].\u000d\u000a    Further reach was achieved through the distribution of a DVD of material\u000d\u000a      gathered during the project.

The oral history project Los\u000a        Ni&#241;os: Child Exiles of the Spanish Civil War (2009-2012)\u000d\u000a      aimed to give surviving evacuees a voice by collecting, preserving and\u000d\u000a      disseminating their personal stories and experiences and feeding into a\u000d\u000a      wider debate on migration. The research was conducted by Dr Alicia\u000d\u000a      Pozo-Guti&#233;rrez, Lecturer in Spanish at the University of Southampton\u000d\u000a      (2005-13) in collaboration with Padmini Broomfield, an oral historian at\u000d\u000a      Hampshire Archives and Local Studies, Southampton City Council. The\u000d\u000a      Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) awarded funding of &#163;47,000 in 2009 [3.1].\u000d\u000a    From the outset, the project involved close engagement with surviving\u000d\u000a      evacuees in Britain and their families. One of the most significant\u000d\u000a      outputs of the research was a digital archive of 30 life histories,\u000d\u000a      compiled by volunteers who had been trained in oral history methods as\u000d\u000a      part of the project. This, together with the published outputs, has added\u000d\u000a      a new perspective to the existing historiography on migration, making\u000d\u000a      children central to the study of violent conflicts and displacement. In\u000d\u000a      turn, the research dissemination activities &#8212; including community\u000d\u000a      symposia, commemorative events, talks and multimedia exhibitions &#8212; added a\u000d\u000a      transnational and intergenerational dimension to the study. The research\u000d\u000a      demonstrated how different constituencies, groups and individuals\u000d\u000a      responded to difficult past experiences, as well as the meaning they\u000d\u000a      attached to the process of commemoration.\u000d\u000a    Two key insights emerged from the research. Firstly, the life stories of\u000d\u000a      the former evacuee children acknowledge losses at many levels (family,\u000d\u000a      home, language, culture, education and childhood), yet at the same time\u000d\u000a      transcend the dominant image of exile as a traumatic experience.\u000d\u000a      Pozo-Guti&#233;rrez and Broomfield argue that despite the suffering and trauma\u000d\u000a      that is often associated with war and displacement, and despite the\u000d\u000a      disruption to their education, the children developed a wide range of\u000d\u000a      skills that enabled them to adapt and survive in a totally alien\u000d\u000a      environment [3.2]. The Ni&#241;os' interpretation of their life\u000d\u000a      histories thus feeds into a wider narrative of resilience and adaptation,\u000d\u000a      where migrants and refugees are seen as active agents in their own lives\u000d\u000a      as opposed to mere victims [3.3, 3.4, 3.5].\u000d\u000a    Secondly, the narrators relate their stories in such a way as to reveal\u000d\u000a      that the context and purpose of their storytelling impact on their\u000d\u000a      memories, determining the details they choose to remember and those they\u000d\u000a      forget. The narrators are sometimes conscious of this process, often\u000d\u000a      driven by the awareness of the extraordinary nature of their life journeys\u000d\u000a      and the desire to share their experiences with their descendants. Others\u000d\u000a      are aware of their role in a collective project of `historical memory\u000d\u000a      recovery' aimed at a wider audience and fulfilling a conciliatory social\u000d\u000a      and political function: claiming a public space for voices that have long\u000d\u000a      remained silenced.\u000d\u000a    Many stories about past events tend to repeat learned and rehearsed\u000d\u000a      `scripts' that reproduce a very generalised account of what in reality\u000d\u000a      were highly individual experiences. Constructing life stories as a\u000d\u000a      collaborative project between the researchers and the Ni&#241;os has\u000d\u000a      produced profound and nuanced findings and shown how the relationship\u000d\u000a      between the Basque children and their own pasts turns out to be highly\u000d\u000a      diverse and often conflictive.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44185","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1062947","Name":"Madagascar"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As a direct result of events organised and close links forged with\u000a      community, artistic, industrial and government leaders during her\u000a      research, Meinhof has been called upon to advise arts programme organisers\u000a      and EU policy makers. The research has also influenced an investigation of\u000a      artists' rights by the Government of Madagascar and raised public\u000a      awareness of cultural diversity issues in Europe and Africa.\u000a    As part of TNMundi, Meinhof organised a series of\u000a      concerts\/conferences in Antananarivo, Madagascar (November 2007, 200\u000a      participants), Rabat, Morocco (13-14\/11\/2008, 150 participants) and\u000a      Southampton (12-19\/10\/2009, 200 participants) [5.1]. All featured\u000a      resident and non-resident national musicians and focused on the role of\u000a      artists and their music within transnational networks resulting in a\u000a      raised awareness of the political, social, legal and economic concerns in\u000a      the relationship between countries of origin and migrants living in\u000a      Europe.\u000a    The two concerts held on 15\/16 November 2007 in Antananarivo, bringing\u000a      together famous resident and non-resident Malagasy musicians, paved the\u000a      way for a wide range of impacts in the period 2008-13. The first concert\u000a      played to a full capacity crowd of 200 government, industrial and cultural\u000a      leaders. The second was attended by a public audience of 300 and was\u000a      broadcast live to an estimated 325,000 prime-time TV viewers. This event\u000a      was widely reviewed and commented on in the media and was accompanied by\u000a      round table discussions including the then Madagascar Minister of Sport\u000a      and Culture, with significant impact in the following years on the\u000a      development of new structures for protecting authors' rights.\u000a    As a direct outcome of the successful Antananarivo concerts and\u000a      conference, in 2008 the musician Dama Mahaleo was among a number of\u000a      artists and others invited by the Madagascar Minister of Sport and Culture\u000a      to participate in several consultations on artists' rights and\u000a      cross-border artistic collaborations. These consultations highlighted as a\u000a      particular concern the right of musicians to be identified as the authors\u000a      of, and economically benefit from, the recordings of their music and led\u000a      to the formation of the `Syndicate of Artists' (2012), which was charged\u000a      with investigating the protection of artists' rights and co-led by Dama\u000a      Mahaleo [5.2].\u000a    Dama had performed in all TNMundi concerts. Within several\u000a      months he and a group of fellow TNMundi performers adopted\u000a      the name The Madagascar All-Stars and in 2009 they released a\u000a      debut album on the French Cinq Plan&#232;tes label [5.2]. After a\u000a      performance organised by Meinhof in the Turner Sims Concert Hall,\u000a      Southampton (November 2009, audience 200) the Editor of Songlines\u000a      magazine said: \"What was interesting was ... the experience of being an\u000a      &#233;migr&#233; and of missing your homeland .... I could see how beneficial the\u000a      shared experience was for (The All-Stars) but also for us as the\u000a      audience\" [5.3].\u000a    Workshops were held in four local schools, and one master class for music\u000a      students in the Turner Sims, with the artists playing with children and\u000a      students. A young saxophonist wrote: \"Thank goodness I had run home before\u000a      the concert to grab my saxophone; I went over to thank the band after the\u000a      master class; they saw my sax and asked me to jam! I don't think I will\u000a      ever forget it; for that brief moment I felt I had dipped into their\u000a      culture and world; it was very special. After hearing them at the\u000a      lunchtime concert, I had to have more! In the evening concert I felt\u000a      myself mouthing the familiar sounding words from before and even singing\u000a      out! I had an interest in World music prior to experiencing the music from\u000a      the Madagascar All-Stars; but these guys made me hungry to seek\u000a      out more. I could really relate to them, their music was so expressive and\u000a      meaningful. When I play my saxophone, I feel as though I am trying to send\u000a      out similar vibes; I loved them!\" And the Headteacher of Bevois Town\u000a      Primary School said: \"I found that the children related to the musicians\u000a      as they came from different countries. They enabled the children to see\u000a      what could be done. Some of the children were particularly impressed that\u000a      they were playing at the Turner Sims and that they (the children) had\u000a      played there last year. It gave them a great feeling of pride.\" [5.3]\u000a    The All-Stars were subsequently invited to Songlines'\u000a      Encounters Festival (9\/6\/12) [5.4]. Also resulting from a first\u000a      collaboration with the TNMundi project, musicians Erick\u000a      Manana (Malagasy) and Jenny Fuhr (German) formed a musical group. They\u000a      played twice in concerts at the Paris Olympia (November 2009 and January\u000a      2013; 1772 seats, sold out), completed a successful concert tour of\u000a      Madagascar (June 2011) and released their debut album (January 2013) [5.5].\u000a    As a direct result of expertise gained and contacts made during her\u000a      research, Meinhof has also been asked to facilitate collaborations between\u000a      `world' musicians, cultural associations, NGOs such as the Freunde\u000a        Madagaskars in Munich, and music festivals such as the Rudolstadt\u000a      World Music festival 2009 and the Madagascar Festival in Weinheim 2013 [5.6].\u000a    As part of SeFoNe Meinhof, Armbruster and their research\u000a      partners organised cultural events (public concerts, exhibitions,\u000a      workshops in schools) for groups of between 50 and 200 in Hungary\u000a      (1-3\/5\/2009), Cyprus (22-23\/5\/2009), Slovakia (30\/4-3\/5 2009), and\u000a      Chemnitz (24\/9\/2009) and Bayreuth (29\/10-1\/11\/2009) in Germany. In\u000a      Bayreuth, a renowned German-Nigerian photographer trained schoolchildren\u000a      from under-privileged backgrounds in photography culminating in an\u000a      exhibition in a major gallery [5.7]. One of the young\u000a      participants, Fabian, wrote (translated from the German original): \"I\u000a      learned to see things very differently. Before I walked past without\u000a      noticing anything and would have thought: why would anyone bother to take\u000a      pictures of fences?\" [5.7]\u000a    Building on the initial findings from SeFoNe, Meinhof was\u000a      commissioned by the European Parliament to report on Cultural Diasporas.\u000a      The report, co-authored with Armbruster in 2008 and commended for its high\u000a      quality by two officials at the European Parliament, drew on research to\u000a      include empirically underpinned arguments to support the need to secure\u000a      better mobility for artists by improving residencies and visa regulations\u000a      [5.8]. The research was further disseminated at an EU conference\u000a      (Brussels 20\/1\/2010) attended by the European Economic and Social\u000a      Committee President of Employment, Social Affairs and Citizenship [5.9].\u000a    In May 2013 Meinhof led a workshop on cultural diversity as part of the\u000a      Global Governance Programme at the European University Institute for 40\u000a      participants including diplomats, EU policymakers, representatives from\u000a      NGOs and business. Feedback from the organisers said: \"Your lecture got\u000a      among the highest evaluation marks ... . We also felt it was most\u000a      appropriate for explaining to the participants in what ways cultural\u000a      diversity can become a true asset for employment and creativity\" [5.10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The University of Southampton has carried out a programme of research\u000a      into transnational networks of migrants, especially musicians from African\u000a      countries, and multicultural neighbourhoods across Europe.

Research led by Ulrike Meinhof, Professor of Cultural Studies\u000a      (2001-present) at the University of Southampton, into the practices of\u000a      migrant cultural practitioners and their transnational cultural networks\u000a      has revealed how migration results in economic, social and cultural\u000a      benefits across geographical borders.\u000a    This research has been framed by two interconnecting, interdisciplinary\u000a      projects, TNMundi: Diaspora as social and cultural\u000a        practice and SeFoNe (Searching for Neighbours):\u000a        Dynamics of physical and mental borders in the new Europe. TNMundi\u000a      was funded by the AHRC (Grant 1, 2006-2010; Research Fellows: Dr Nadia\u000a      Kiwan and Dr Marie-Pierre Gibert). SeFoNe, co-directed by\u000a      Dr Heidi Armbruster (Lecturer in German, University of Southampton,\u000a      2003-present), was funded by the EU (Grant 2, 2007-2010, Research Fellows:\u000a      Dr Hauke Dorsch and Dr Casssandra Ellerbe-Dueck) and conducted in\u000a      conjunction with the Universities of Berne (Switzerland), Nicosia\u000a      (Cyprus), Catania (Italy), Chemnitz (Germany) and the Hungarian Academy of\u000a      Sciences.\u000a    For TNMundi, Meinhof analysed the patterns of movements\u000a      and transnational networks created by different artists of Malagasy and\u000a      North African origin travelling to, through and from Europe to address\u000a      broader questions of sociocultural diversity, interaction and citizenship.\u000a      This involved consumption and reception studies with migrant groups\u000a      (individual interviews, focus groups), participant observation at cultural\u000a      events and in-depth 'expert' interviews with media\/cultural policymakers,\u000a      executives and practitioners in Europe and Africa.\u000a    A key part of this research was the organisation of interconnecting\u000a      multi-artist cultural events in Antananarivo, Madagascar (November 2007),\u000a      Rabat, Morocco (October 2008) and Southampton (October 2009). Through such\u000a      events Meinhof identified the significance and function of migration\u000a      `hubs': individuals, formal or informal cultural organisations, and cities\u000a      with vital infrastructures (e.g. Paris, London, Antananarivo or\u000a      Casablanca) able to link new artists with established artists. In addition\u000a      to these human, institutional and spatial hubs, the research demonstrated\u000a      the importance of `accidental' hubs, such as the Antananarivo concerts,\u000a      created through the research process itself [3.1.1 - 3.1.4].\u000a    SeFoNe took the research methods, findings and\u000a      collaborative cultural event structures established in TNMundi\u000a      and expanded the focus both geographically (to Germany, Switzerland,\u000a      Italy, Hungary and Cyprus) and artistically (to include photography,\u000a      dance, art and cookery as well as music). Through exploring community\u000a      relations marked by national, ethnic or racial boundaries and examining\u000a      local negotiations of those boundaries, including attempts to overcome\u000a      them, researchers brought into focus two normally distinct research\u000a      agendas: border studies and migration studies. Interviews and community\u000a      surveys with key stakeholders allowed researchers to evaluate and critique\u000a      existing official policies on integration and identify activities for good\u000a      neighbourhood building [3.2.1 - 3.2.2].\u000a    Key findings in both TNMundi and SeFoNe\u000a      included the identification of obstacles in overcoming hurdles associated\u000a      with migration (e.g. insecure minority status leading to mobility or work\u000a      restrictions, obstacles resulting from prejudice, racism or other forms of\u000a      `out-grouping') and the role `transcultural capital' (skills, talents,\u000a      networks associated with migrants' origin) can play in overcoming these\u000a      obstacles [3.1 and 3.2, and Report for European Parliament\u000a      on cultural diasporas: see section 4, below].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44186","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the research has been two-fold, informing government\u000a      education policy on MFL and helping practitioners improve the way\u000a      languages are taught in schools. The first project was commissioned by a\u000a      previous government, which saw its conclusions as an endorsement of its\u000a      plans to make MFL compulsory in the primary school curriculum from 2011 [5.1,\u000a        5.2]. The researchers regularly communicated their findings to the\u000a      DCSF, including in a formal seminar in spring 2010 for teacher educators,\u000a      advisers and other professional leaders. The project's advisory board\u000a      included Dr Lid King, Director of the National Languages Strategy for\u000a      England (2002-10). Dr King has commented in some detail: \"The development\u000a      of a programme for primary language learning 7-11 was a central element in\u000a      the National Languages Strategy for England [...]. The research carried\u000a      out by your team played a critical part in convincing Ministers of the\u000a      viability and importance of primary languages and in establishing the\u000a      necessary conditions for success. In my view it had a direct impact on the\u000a      subsequent `Rose Review' of the primary curriculum in which for the first\u000a      time languages had an important place. In particular we used your findings\u000a      to develop realistic but challenging learning outcomes in the proposed\u000a      programmes of study [...]. This review of the primary curriculum was\u000a      adopted in its entirety by the previous government and was due to be\u000a      implemented from September 2011. Although the change of administration\u000a      delayed this process, primary languages will become statutory in 2014 and\u000a      the Longitudinal Study has been an important factor underpinning this\u000a      significant policy change\". [5.1, 5.6]\u000a    With the change of government in May 2010, however, a further major\u000a      review of the primary curriculum was commissioned, which, as Dr King\u000a      indicates, left the status of MFL unclear. Mitchell nevertheless continued\u000a      to advise government, meeting schools minister Nick Gibb in autumn 2010.\u000a      She has made submissions to the ongoing consultations for the curriculum\u000a      review, most recently in April 2013. She is also a member of the board of\u000a      The Languages Company, an independent lobbying group set up by Dr King to\u000a      promote MFL in education. The most recent government proposals to make the\u000a      teaching of a single foreign language statutory throughout Key Stage 2, as\u000a      set out in the final National Curriculum documentation published in\u000a      September 2013, following drafts published throughout 2012 and 2013, are\u000a      substantially in line with the recommendations from Southampton's first\u000a      project [5.8]. Most notably, the `subject content' detailed for\u000a      languages reflects closely the findings of Southampton's research\u000a      regarding children's achievement, in terms of both grammar and language\u000a      skills. Bernardette Holmes, immediate Past President of the Association\u000a      for Language Learning (ALL) and government adviser on the new statutory\u000a      National Curriculum, says: \"Findings and recommendations from this\u000a      authoritative study continue to inform decisions around effective\u000a      pedagogy, strategic planning of the curriculum and support structures for\u000a      professional development. In preparation for September 2014, when language\u000a      learning from the age of 7 will become statutory, ALL is setting up\u000a      primary hubs across the country to support teachers to meet the practical\u000a      challenges involved in teaching a new language. The research report gives\u000a      us an invaluable source of reference to sharpen our understanding of the\u000a      issues involved in developing appropriate, age-related learning with\u000a      realistic outcomes. It also draws attention to the essential conditions of\u000a      leadership, staffing and resources which must accompany successful\u000a      language learning in primary schools at local and national levels.\" [5.3]\u000a    The findings from both projects were also disseminated to MFL\u000a      practitioners. Mitchell ran sessions for trainee primary MFL teachers in\u000a      Southampton in 2009, 2010 and 2012. She gave presentations on pedagogy, on\u000a      children's attitudes and on learning outcomes arising from these projects\u000a      at major teachers' conferences: ALL conference, March 2010 (plenary\u000a      presentation, 200 delegates); Deal\/ Medway\/ Kent Language Teachers\u000a      conference, June 2010 (plenary, 100 delegates); Links into Languages\u000a      conference, Cambridge, September 2010 (25 attendees); and Primary\u000a      Languages Show, London, March 2012 (30 attendees) [5.4].\u000a    The second research project featured a conference in July 2011 in\u000a      Newcastle at which the main results were presented, with Mitchell leading\u000a      on presentation of MFL pedagogy. Attendees were 30 language teachers,\u000a      teacher trainers and other education professionals. Evaluation forms\u000a      showed 94% felt the conference `addressed my interests' `well' or `very\u000a      well', and 100% said it was `good' or `very good'. This was also the\u000a      occasion for the first showing of the 20-minute, professionally produced\u000a      film, In The Caf&#233;, documenting the oral teaching approach which\u000a      Southampton found to typify current good practice in primary school. The\u000a      response to the film and the findings was very positive, with an average\u000a      approval rating of 4.72 out of 5 [5.4]. In The Caf&#233; has\u000a      been distributed to teacher training institutions concerned with primary\u000a      MFL and is available from websites at Southampton and Essex. Teacher\u000a      educator Alex Woodgate-Jones comments: \"The film made the notion of\u000a      primary MFLs much more accessible and imaginable and I have had many\u000a      requests since then to make the film available so trainees can watch it in\u000a      its entirety. I think it is an extremely effective resource to encourage\u000a      teachers to engage with primary MFLs and see how much can be achieved.\" [5.5,\u000a        5.9]\u000a    Other presentations of the research and film showings were organised by\u000a      Mitchell and Myles at a University of Southampton Public Engagement Day in\u000a      September 2011, at the University of Cambridge in November 2010, a school\u000a      in County Durham in November 2011, at the Essex Language Conference for\u000a      Teachers in September 2012, at a plenary session for 160 trainee teachers\u000a      at the University of Southampton in October 2012, and at a public lecture\u000a      at the University of East Anglia in November 2012. Similarly positive\u000a      feedback was received (e.g. at the Essex event, 80% of respondents gave\u000a      top rating to the primary research\/ film session). There is ongoing demand\u000a      from teachers and teacher trainers for advice on foreign language teaching\u000a      to young learners (leading to upcoming events planned in York in February\u000a      2014 and Umea, Sweden in June 2014). Mitchell and her colleagues have\u000a      continued to work with ALL to create web resources for the teaching\u000a      profession on best practice for MFL teaching in primary school.\u000a    The wider interest in the subject sparked by the research was reflected\u000a      in a report in the Times Educational Supplement of 23 February\u000a      2010: \"Primary children are at the forefront of a culture shift in favour\u000a      of language learning, a three-year study has shown. The major academic\u000a      investigation concluded that the Government's long-standing policy of\u000a      compulsory language teaching in primary schools may be helping to change a\u000a      widespread national cynicism towards learning foreign languages such as\u000a      French, German or Spanish.\" [5.7] Other media coverage of the\u000a      research includes a live interview with Myles on BBC Radio Essex on 4\u000a      November 2011 and a video presentation by Myles made for the University of\u000a      Essex [5.10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The University of Southampton's research into the teaching of modern\u000a      foreign languages (MFLs) in UK schools has helped shape government\u000a      education policy and contributed to an improvement in the way children\u000a      acquire knowledge of other languages and cultures. By studying teaching\u000a      methods in the classroom and devising tests to measure how effective they\u000a      are in giving children the ability to communicate in another language, the\u000a      researchers contributed to the current widespread acceptance of the\u000a      importance of introducing language learning at primary level.

Since 2001 the number of pupils in\u000a      England taking a foreign language to GCSE level has fallen from 78% to\u000a      43%. This trend is a cause of serious concern to the government. The chair\u000a      of the all-party parliamentary group on modern languages, Baroness\u000a      Coussins, called in 2010 for a \"national languages recovery programme\",\u000a      citing an OECD survey, which found that Key Stage 3 pupils in England\u000a      spent just 7% of their school time on languages &#8212; less than any other EU\u000a      country apart from Ireland. Southampton's research set out to discover how\u000a      to construct a coherent national language learning policy, starting in\u000a      primary school, and how to support teachers in developing effective\u000a      teaching methods.\u000a    There were two research projects, both carried out by teams led locally\u000a      by Ros Mitchell, Professor of Applied Linguistics (at Southampton since\u000a      1986), and including Louise Courtney, Research Assistant since 2007. The\u000a      first project (2006-2009), conducted in collaboration with the Open\u000a      University and Canterbury Christ Church University, and for which\u000a      Southampton received a grant worth &#163;178,000, examined MFL learning in 40\u000a      primary schools. The study was funded by the Department for Children,\u000a      Schools and Families (DCSF, now Department for Education), which wanted to\u000a      know whether language teaching could or should become compulsory at\u000a      primary level. Southampton designed the main classroom observation scheme\u000a      and the assessment tools used to measure the children's language\u000a      proficiency. This involved visiting the schools, carrying out focus group\u000a      discussions, observing MFL lessons and testing the children. The\u000a      researchers concluded that primary schools had managed to develop viable\u000a      teaching methodologies and saw MFL as key to promoting children's\u000a      intercultural understanding. They found that the attitude of the children\u000a      themselves was overwhelmingly positive and that, when a language was\u000a      taught consistently, the learning outcomes were good. Building proficiency\u000a      in one language at primary school was key to a smooth transition to MFL\u000a      learning at secondary school [3.1, 3.2].\u000a    The second project (2009-11) was conducted jointly with a team led by\u000a      Professor Florence Myles of Newcastle University. The aim of this project\u000a      was to assess the learning of French by children aged 5, 7 and 11. The\u000a      ESRC awarded Southampton funding of &#163;55,900 for this research, in which 38\u000a      hours of French instruction were provided for beginners in each age group.\u000a      Their development was tracked through observation and through language\u000a      tests. The teaching emphasised oral skills and used active methods to\u000a      engage the children's interest. Southampton led the analysis of classroom\u000a      teaching methods and contributed to analysis of children's grammatical\u000a      proficiency. The findings showed that the cognitive maturity of the\u000a      11-year-olds placed them at an advantage for grammar learning, though\u000a      vocabulary learning was similar for all ages. However, the younger\u000a      children were considerably more motivated than the oldest group,\u000a      confirming the motivational advantages of an early start to MFL [3.4].\u000a      Mitchell co-edited the resulting film In the Caf&#233; and Southampton\u000a      hosts the project's electronic archive comprising the children's speech\u000a      data and transcriptions.\u000a    Combined, both projects clearly demonstrated the viability of MFL\u000a      instruction in primary schools, including the evolution of a practicable\u000a      teaching methodology and its capacity to motivate and engage children aged\u000a      5 to 11, in contrast to motivational difficulties at secondary school\u000a      level [3.3, 3.5].\u000a    "}]

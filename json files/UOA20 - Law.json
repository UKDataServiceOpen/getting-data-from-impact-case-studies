[{"CaseStudyId":"522","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aProfessor Howarth's extensive research has had considerable and cumulative direct impact on the\u000d\u000adesign, enforcement and practical operation of UK environmental law, particularly (but not\u000d\u000aexclusively) in relation to water and fisheries. His research has had significant influence on the\u000d\u000awork of the Government, on Fish Legal (an important and longstanding environmental NGO), and\u000d\u000aon the practice of professional legal and environmental practitioners. The impact of this research\u000d\u000ahas been furthered through an extensive range of high level consultancy and policy-oriented\u000d\u000aadvisory activities, which have allowed him to feed in the insights of his research at a high level.\u000d\u000aWhile these are too numerous to be detailed here, by way of illustration, these include acting as\u000d\u000aspecialist legal consultant to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and as a\u000d\u000alegal advisor to the Northern Ireland Environment Department.\u000d\u000aa) Impact on Government Policy and Practice\u000d\u000aHowarth's work, and particularly his research on the effective formulation and enforcement of\u000d\u000aenvironmental law, has both shaped the terms of policy debate and had considerable direct\u000d\u000ainfluence on government environmental policy and practice (source 1).\u000d\u000aThe Pathway to Impact: Prior to this REF period and laying the groundwork for significant impact\u000d\u000awithin it, Howarth worked with WRc (formerly the Water Research Centre, now a leading UK\u000d\u000aenvironmental consultancy), providing the legal components of a report for DEFRA on The\u000d\u000aEffectiveness of Enforcement of Environmental Legislation (DEFRA Report 7208; WRc, 2006),\u000d\u000awhich draws closely on his research (e.g. output 1, Ch.9 on pollution offences). Throughout a\u000d\u000asubsequent, ongoing and lengthy reform process in which Howarth has continued to be closely\u000d\u000ainvolved, this Report has provided an important source of evidence of the multiple inadequacies of\u000d\u000athe current law and continues to serve as a basis for the development of further measures\u000d\u000acontributing to a more stringent legal regime for dealing with environmental offences. Most\u000d\u000aimmediately, the influence of the Report was seen in its effect on the Government's Review of\u000d\u000aEnforcement in Environmental Regulation (2006). Drawing specifically on what a DEFRA\u000d\u000aspokesperson describes as Howarth's `helpful' contribution to the WRc report, serving to identify\u000d\u000a`problems that had to be overcome in any new enforcement system' (source 1), the Review\u000d\u000ahighlighted some key underlying obstacles to more proportionate, consistent, transparent and\u000d\u000aeffective environmental enforcement. DEFRA's longest serving environmental lawyer explains that\u000d\u000athis preparatory work also influenced the authors of the subsequent DEFRA Report, Review of\u000d\u000aEnforcement in Environmental Regulation (2006) (source 2).\u000d\u000aImpact since 2008: The WRc Report and the 2006 Review, which draws on it, have continued to\u000d\u000aframe reform efforts and to exert a strong influence on Government thinking since 2008. The\u000d\u000aDEFRA spokesperson cited above describes the legal research (authored by Howarth and cited\u000d\u000aextensively in Annex B of the Report) as having `put Defra in a good position to respond to the\u000d\u000asubsequent Macrory Review, which was very influential in shaping Defra's subsequent policy on\u000d\u000aenforcement, culminating in the civil sanctions order in 2010'. The 2010 Order allows\u000d\u000aenvironmental regulators to impose civil sanctions on a business committing certain environmental\u000d\u000aoffences, as an alternative to prosecution and\/or criminal penalties of fines and imprisonment. This\u000d\u000arepresents a key step in making enforcement more effective and proportionate, particularly in\u000d\u000arelation to minor offences and offences that are committed unintentionally. In addition to this\u000d\u000aintroduction of provision for civil penalties, the Report has also underpinned ongoing work on more\u000d\u000adetailed proposals for strengthened sentencing powers in relation to environmental offences. As\u000d\u000asuch, the DEFRA lawyer confirms that after six years and a number of further initiatives down the\u000d\u000aline, the recommendations of the Report `continue to resonate' (source 2).\u000d\u000aThese important issues received further attention in DEFRA's Fairer and Better Environmental\u000d\u000aEnforcement Project. Begun in 2007 and ongoing throughout this REF period, this project built on\u000d\u000athe Review to develop recommendations for a more transparent, proportionate, consistent and\u000d\u000aeffective environmental enforcement system in England and Wales (http:\/\/archive.defra.gov.uk\/env\u000d\u000aironment\/policy\/enforcement\/review\/report.htm). In pursuance of these aims, a public consultation\u000d\u000atook place in 2009 to seek views on Government proposals to introduce civil sanctions for existing\u000d\u000aenvironmental offences in England and Wales under the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions\u000d\u000aAct 2008. Howarth's work was deemed an important part of the evidence base for this highly\u000d\u000asignificant ongoing work (source 1), being found by DEFRA to be particularly valuable in showing\u000d\u000athe limitations of data available, evaluating the role of strict liability in sentencing and highlighting\u000d\u000athe concern that judicial precedent may serve to undermine proportionality in sentencing practice\u000d\u000a(source 1).\u000d\u000aThe consultation has been followed by a Government Response and Summary of Replies (2010,\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/archive.defra.gov.uk\/environment\/policy\/enforcement\/pdf\/summary-reponses.pdf) supporting\u000d\u000aproposals for the introduction of civil sanctions and initial proposals to strengthen the powers of\u000d\u000acriminal courts in sentencing the worst environmental offenders.\u000d\u000ab) Impact on the work of NGOs\u000d\u000aHowarth's work has also impacted on the activities of NGOs, particularly those of Fish Legal, the\u000d\u000alegal action organisation associated with the Angling Trust (a not-for-profit organisation which\u000d\u000arepresents angling interests and the protection of the water environment with 11,000 subscription-\u000d\u000apaying members). It is dedicated to using law to fight pollution and other damage to the\u000d\u000afreshwater and marine water environment, protecting aquatic ecosystems and fisheries, and acting\u000d\u000afor fishing clubs, fishery owners, syndicates and commercial fisheries, having brought a range of\u000d\u000asignificant cases (http:\/\/www.fishlegal.net\/page.asp?section=168&amp;sectionTitle=Current Cases). It\u000d\u000ais also active in lobbying government and public bodies on issues relating to the protection of the\u000d\u000aaquatic environment. Drawing upon his academic legal research, and particularly his extensive\u000d\u000astudy of water pollution and water quality law (output 1), Howarth advises on whether particular\u000d\u000alegal actions, including litigation, can and should be pursued in relation to water pollution and\u000d\u000awater quality concerns impacting upon fisheries. Howarth is the sole academic advisor on the\u000d\u000aAdvisory Committee.\u000d\u000aIn the words of the chief solicitor of Fish Legal, Howarth's work has had `direct and significant\u000d\u000aimpact on the way in which we have been approaching issues of rights of access and navigation\u000d\u000aon watercourses, the law on Freedom of Information and Environmental Information Regulations,\u000d\u000aEuropean law, interpretation of sections of the Water Resources Act 1991 on abstraction and other\u000d\u000amatters' and his advice has been `invaluable' (source 3). To take just one, specific example of this\u000d\u000aimpact, he cites the inclusion of Howarth's research in the bundle of materials put into the court in\u000d\u000athe groundbreaking case of Fish Legal and Emily Shirley v ICO and Yorkshire Water, United\u000d\u000aUtilities and Southern Water (EA\/2010\/0069 &amp; 0076).\u000d\u000ac) Impact on Professional Practice\u000d\u000aIn the field of environmental law there is a particularly close interface between `academic' and\u000d\u000a`practical' scholarship and Howarth's research is typically in areas which span the academic-\u000d\u000apractitioner divide, with articles in academic journals frequently used by legal and environmental\u000d\u000apractitioners. Notably, non academic readership of the Journal of Water Law (edited by Howarth)\u000d\u000aand the journals in which his publications have appeared is significantly higher than might be\u000d\u000aexpected for other fields of legal `academic' research, on occasion citing a non-academic\u000d\u000areadership of over 80% (source 5). Further, publications that draw on the underpinning research,\u000d\u000ae.g. in outputs 1 and 7 above, have appeared in a form which is designed to be accessible and\u000d\u000auseful to a practitioner audience. Most notable, however, is the translation of Howarth's academic\u000d\u000aresearch into practical legal guidance undertaken in his capacity as a consultant editor of\u000d\u000aHalsbury's Laws of England, Volumes 100 and 101, Water and Waterways, LexisNexis (5th ed.\u000d\u000a2009) and Volumes 45 and 46, Environmental Quality and Public Health, LexisNexis (5th ed.\u000d\u000a2010). This is the UK's leading legal encyclopaedia and is used daily by legal practitioners in\u000d\u000aEngland and Wales.\u000d\u000aIn summary, through the body of work described above, Professor Howarth's research has made a\u000d\u000asignificant contribution to broader efforts to achieve sustainable development in relation to the\u000d\u000aaquatic environment, aiming to shape law and policy capable of impacting on behaviour in ways\u000d\u000athat help to protect the aquatic environment. This impact has been felt on the work of Government,\u000d\u000aplaying a key part in framing and informing significant policy development since 2008 and making a\u000d\u000asignificant contribution to legal reform, particularly in the form of the Civil Sanctions Order (2010)\u000d\u000aand on the work of NGOs and environmental practitioners.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aProfessor Howarth's extensive research has had considerable and cumulative impact on the\u000d\u000adesign, enforcement and practical operation of UK environmental law, particularly (but not\u000d\u000aexclusively) in relation to water and fisheries. His specific contribution has been in influencing\u000d\u000anational policy on enforcement and sentencing. In particular, two key ideas developed and\u000d\u000aadvanced in his research - `modernisation' and `purposiveness' - have provided an important\u000d\u000aalternative to the previously dominant, traditional, reactive approach of criminalising\u000d\u000aenvironmentally unacceptable behaviour. Howarth's research has impacted in three direct ways.\u000d\u000aFirst, it has `significantly influenced' the work of the Department for the Environment, Food and\u000d\u000aRural Affairs (DEFRA), making a material contribution to improvements in the legislative\u000d\u000aframework and operation of UK environmental law. Second, it has had a `direct and significant'\u000d\u000aimpact on the work of Fish Legal, a key environmental NGO, with which Howarth has developed a\u000d\u000aclose, ongoing relationship and which has found his advice `invaluable'. Finally, it forms part of the\u000d\u000acanon widely relied on by professional legal and environmental practitioners in their day to day\u000d\u000awork. The impact of Howarth's research has been furthered through an extensive range of high\u000d\u000alevel consultancy and policy-oriented advisory activities, which have allowed him to feed in the\u000d\u000ainsights of his research at a high level. These include acting as a specialist legal consultant to the\u000d\u000aFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and as a legal advisor to the Northern\u000d\u000aIreland Environment Department.\u000d\u000a","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000d\u000aUniversity of Kent\u000d\u000a","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Kent (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Kent","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007150}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a\u000a1.

This work represents a sustained and ongoing, policy-oriented engagement with\u000d\u000aboth the substance of UK environmental law and its practical operation. His major research\u000d\u000acontribution has been a detailed and extended study of the challenge of translating global\u000d\u000aenvironmental imperatives regarding sustainable development and sustainable management of\u000d\u000athe aquatic environment into workable regulatory mechanisms capable of effectively securing\u000d\u000aacceptable levels of environmental quality in practice. Typically, this has involved critical scrutiny\u000d\u000aof environmental measures adopted at European Union level, their transposition into national\u000d\u000alegislation and the evaluation of the effectiveness of specific legal measures as they operate in\u000d\u000apractice (e.g. outputs 1, 4 and 6). This scrutiny of environmental legislation has produced many\u000d\u000acritical and constructive suggestions as to how environmental regulation and its enforcement might\u000d\u000abe enhanced across a spectrum of environmental areas: in relation to the balance of public and\u000d\u000aprivate responsibilities for water resources planning; in relation to the effectiveness of public\u000d\u000aparticipation in water quality management; and in relation to international standards of `good\u000d\u000apractice' for aquaculture development (e.g. outputs 2, 6, 8).\u000d\u000aHowarth's research has centred around the advancement of two key, innovative ideas.

The group held consultations in 2008 and issued its\u000a      report in 2009. TJI researchers engaged directly with CGP and the report\u000a      cites research by several TJI scholars, e.g.\u000a    \u000a      In a written submission, Campbell &amp; Turner made recommendations\u000a        that were adopted in the Group's report: e.g. that investigations by the\u000a        Police Ombudsman provided a template for a unit to be established in\u000a        Truth Commission; that special mechanisms be developed for identifying\u000a        patterns of violations (and thus appropriate remedies); and that the\u000a        basis for establishing such mechanisms be under a British-Irish\u000a        Agreement, with legislation in both jurisdictions.\u000a      Hamber made a written submission and held direct meetings with CGP\u000a        members, in which he articulated precise and useable methods to include\u000a        and give recognition to victims. The final emphasis of the CGP on\u000a        prioritising the needs and experiences of victims reflects substantially\u000a        his scholarly work. As Chair of Healing Through Remembering, the leading\u000a        NGO addressing the legacy of the past, Hamber was also instrumental in\u000a        shaping the substantive content of its engagement with the CGP as well\u000a        as the content of its publications. HTR's Director states that Hamber\u000a        had `an invaluable input into the formation of policy and practice' of\u000a        the organisation.\u000a    \u000a    The significance of TJI's engagement with this process is acknowledged in\u000a      testimonial by the Group's, Co-Chair, Bradley, who notes `the work of the\u000a      Transitional Justice Institute was one of the more fertile grounds that\u000a      enabled and influenced myself and the other members of the Group. The\u000a      research that had been carried out enabled us to enter into and proceed\u000a      with greater insight and confidence.'

TJI's collaboration with Rita Duffy, one\u000a      of NI's leading contemporary artists, stretched knowledge transfer and\u000a      broader social impact boundaries. It enabled TJI researchers to impact\u000a      positively on the artist's work, the young people who took part in the\u000a      project, and the Quaker Cottage Belfast, and to find innovative ways of\u000a      transmitting our research findings to the general public. TJI researchers\u000a      were engaged in all stages of the project from initial project design,\u000a      conceptualisation, implementation to dissemination:\u000a    \u000a      TJI fostered an intensive nine-month dialogue with Duffy on the\u000a        experience of children, ex- combatants and women (2009-10) drawing on\u000a        published work and work in progress by TJI scholars. This included TJI\u000a        scholars visiting and working in Duffy's studio. Duffy's testimonial\u000a        confirms that her work was substantially shaped by the publications of\u000a        N&#237; Aol&#225;in, Rooney and Rolston, discussions with the authors, and\u000a        participating in TJI seminars. For Duffy this collaboration enabled a\u000a        deep connection to academic articulations of harm, informed her thinking\u000a        on how art can illuminate difficult social issues and helped to shape\u000a        her methodology.\u000a      Duffy held workshops at the Quaker Cottage three evenings per week\u000a        with young people from areas that are divided by peace walls. Duffy\u000a        sought to give voice to these young persons who live in post-conflict\u000a        Belfast by working with them on storytelling and collaborative\u000a        self-portraits. Throughout this process, Duffy sought advice and support\u000a        from TJI staff. This resulted in Our View. In the book's\u000a        foreword, Quaker Cottage youth worker Doherty, explains how this process\u000a        gave the young people involved a sense of control over their lives they\u000a        had not previously had.\u000a      The project resulted in an exhibition at the Playhouse in London\/Derry\u000a        as part of the TJI Summer School (June 2010) which had 35 participants,\u000a        and a collective art exhibition at the collaborative Summer School with\u000a        Hanna's House (August 2010), which had 100 participants and enabled\u000a        knowledge exchange with local and international NGO and policy cohort.\u000a        In September 2010, a huge public campaign was launched involving the\u000a        displaying the young persons' photographic self-portraits on billboards\u000a        in the centre of Belfast bringing attention to a group of young people\u000a        as an illustration of how the `past' of the conflict was ever present.\u000a        TJI researcher N&#237; Aol&#225;in worked with the artist to choose and identify\u000a        the exhibit images.\u000a    \u000a    Following the formal completion of the project, the relationship with the\u000a      artist has been sustained and she has presented seminars at TJI. Duffy\u000a      also presented the project at the Ulster Museum and internationally. This\u000a      project demonstrates praxis research at its most ambitious, combining\u000a      academic knowledge with broader social and artistic media, to reach the\u000a      general public to change the way communities `see' the conflict and thus\u000a      respond to legal and political initiatives.\u000a    Transitional Justice Grassroots Toolkit: TJI worked with\u000a      the Bridge of Hope programme of the Ashton Community Trust that supports\u000a      conflict victims and is based in one of the most divided and volatile\u000a      communities in NI to produce an internationally recognised participatory\u000a      model for grassroots TJ, which is now being disseminated by TJI. TJI\u000a      engaged in this project at all stages:\u000a    \u000a      The project began through a series of preliminary conversations\u000a        throughout 2010 between TJI scholar Rooney and Bridge of Hope leading to\u000a        a TJ Pilot Programme funded by the Community Relations Council. This\u000a        built capacity among community activists to engage in debates on dealing\u000a        with the past and provided a vehicle for conversations between\u000a        leadership groups of ex-prisoners and community activists. It explicitly\u000a        built on the TJI `@thecoalface' seminar series\u000a      Rooney designed and delivered a residential programme in March 2011\u000a        for former combatants that brought TJI's scholarly inputs on truth,\u000a        institutional reform, reparations, reconciliation, and amnesty into\u000a        direct engagement with community activists at the coal face of\u000a        transitional processes. Participant feedback reports an eagerness on\u000a        behalf of all participants to investigate TJ in the local and\u000a        international context. In autumn 2011, the programme held a seminar\u000a        series to which TJI researchers contributed.\u000a      TJI hosted the final meeting of the Steering Committee in December\u000a        2011, at which community activists emphasised the importance of research\u000a        and public engagement by TJI researchers.\u000a      Throughout this process, Rooney developed and tested the TJ\u000a          Grassroots Toolkit (http:\/\/www.thebridgeofhope.org\/media\/transitional-justice-toolkit-book.pdf),\u000a        drawing on her own rich writings and the work of her TJI colleagues (see\u000a        project report)\u000a      In 2012, TJI submitted a joint application with Bridge of Hope to the\u000a        Victims and Survivors Fund to publish the Toolkit and facilitate its\u000a        global dissemination. We are awaiting the decision.\u000a      TJI deployed the Toolkit in its 2012 and 2013 summer schools.\u000a        International summer school participants have adopted the Toolkit as a\u000a        model to be used in other transitions. Toolkit was successfully used in\u000a        USAID training provided by McWilliams to Syrian women leaders (2013).\u000a    \u000a    Ongoing work includes production of a `Training the Trainers' manual, as\u000a      well as a Gender Toolkit. The Office of the First Minister and Deputy\u000a      First Minister confirm that `[t]he programme was beneficial for good\u000a      relations'. Testimonial evidence supports the direct positive influence of\u000a      TJ tools on abating community tensions between the communities who\u000a      participated in the programme. The participants also asserted that the\u000a      Toolkit produced accessible and readily usable knowledge to community\u000a      groups and activists working directly with the legacy of the past in daily\u000a      life in NI.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Based on its internationally recognised reframing of transitional justice\u000a      (TJ) theory and practice, TJI demonstrates singular influence on the tone,\u000a      language, framing and outcomes of key debates, policies and advocacy in\u000a      Northern Ireland (NI) since 2003.

The enduring power of\u000a      the past to destabilise the present is vividly highlighted by serious\u000a      protests and sustained rioting throughout 2013 triggered by decisions to\u000a      fly the Union Flag at Belfast City Hall only on designated days and to\u000a      place restrictions on contentious Orange Order marches. The violence of\u000a      the `Troubles' resulted in 3,636 deaths and 47,571 injured persons. For a\u000a      small jurisdiction, the pervasive impact of this high rate of violence was\u000a      illustrated in a 2011 Commission for Victims and Survivors survey finding\u000a      one in three persons in NI self-identified as conflict survivors. Past\u000a      abuses continue to shape how communities in NI interact with one another\u000a      and how citizens view state institutions. In particular, law and legal\u000a      institutions became sites of contestation, resulting in challenges to\u000a      their legitimacy following the Good Friday peace agreement.\u000a    The conflict experience and the need to identify imaginative legal and\u000a      policy solutions were instrumental to the founding vision of TJI as a\u000a      praxis entity. Its core researchers conceived of TJ as a conceptual and\u000a      practical framework to address the challenges of a post-conflict society.\u000a      TJI's research was designed to create new modalities and frameworks to\u000a      engage the legacies of harm in transitional settings. TJI's praxis vision\u000a      is influenced by the critical role School of Law and TJI founders played\u000a      in shaping legal discourses, civil society and institutional responses to\u000a      the conflict before and after the peace agreement. TJI staff (N&#237; Aol&#225;in,\u000a      Campbell, Bell, Rolston, McWilliams) shaped and led truth and\u000a      accountability campaigns by collaborating with local NGOs (e.g. Relatives\u000a      for Justice, Committee for the Administration of Justice). They researched\u000a      and published on victims' experiences, brought cases to the European Court\u000a      of Human Rights (ECHR), and made submissions to international human rights\u000a      bodies on the UK's treaty obligations. These campaigns led the ECHR from\u000a      2001 to find that the UK was obliged to investigate all right to life\u000a      violations. In 2002, the UK created a `package of measures' to investigate\u000a      conflict-related deaths. TJI's establishment in 2003 married the\u000a      individual activism of TJI researchers with their international and\u000a      comparative expertise. TJI researchers continue to be deeply involved in\u000a      research and activism in NI, shaping and leading conceptualisation of TJ\u000a      mechanisms, and legally grounding grassroots activism on dealing with the\u000a      past and institutional reform through networks, consultancy, leadership\u000a      positions in NGOs and government entities, and policy intervention.\u000a    TJI's dealing with the past research has consistently offered critical\u000a      analyses, both theoretical and practical, of local TJ measures, which\u000a      raise awareness of best practice and highlight potential challenges for\u000a      efforts to deal with the past in other transitions. By reframing the TJ\u000a      field, TJI scholars opened up a new lens on what constitutes the\u000a      transitional `package' in post-conflict societies. Their contributions\u000a      included linking multiple past-centred mechanisms as part of holistic TJ\u000a      approaches and insisting on the relevance of TJ as a framework to address\u000a      the experiences of societies emerging from conflict. TJI's model has been\u000a      mainstreamed into the work of international institutions, other academic\u000a      frameworks and is the approach taken by leading international NGOs. This\u000a      interplay between the local and international is a core element of TJI's\u000a      research and illustrates how locally focused research can have an\u000a      international impact. TJI research insights profoundly shaped the contours\u000a      of the TJ field (with evident international reach) and specifically\u000a      applied this knowledge to benefit the NI transition towards sustained\u000a      peace and substantive democracy (see Managing Editor, International\u000a      Journal of TJ). This case study draws on a sample of three interfaces from\u000a      our broader scholarly and policy praxis in NI. They illustrate how\u000a      research insights from TJI have shaped the terms of the legal, political\u000a      and cultural conversations in the jurisdiction, and been manifested in the\u000a      policies and positions adopted by government and civil society groups.\u000a    Underpinning Research and Key Insights: Dealing with the\u000a      past research has been a core project of TJI since its creation and is\u000a      motivated by questions such as how should we understand the past, what is\u000a      the past's impact on the present, how can we undo the past, and to what\u000a      extent can we deliver accountability for past abuses. Exploring the impact\u000a      that past harms can have on present and future generations played a key\u000a      role in TJI's collaboration with artist Rita Duffy. This project revealed\u000a      how the conflict's legacy continues to impact on the lives of marginalised\u000a      youth. Engaging with N&#237; Aol&#225;in and Rolston's research provided the\u000a      grounding for Duffy's creativity. For Rolston concern for the\u000a      intergenerational effects of violent conflict has been an underpinning\u000a      motif evidenced in his book Children of the Revolution. This\u000a      research conducted between 2008-11 explores how the children of\u000a      paramilitary actors were affected by their parents' actions during the\u000a      conflict. This research is methodologically challenging as it gives\u000a      primacy to victims' voices in a context where access to individuals may be\u000a      fraught and great trust in the researcher is required. This approach\u000a      influenced Duffy's own methodology. The need to give gendered voice to\u000a      victims has been a central feature of N&#237; Aol&#225;in &amp; Turner's research,\u000a      also drawn upon by Duffy. N&#237; Aol&#225;in established an extensive body of\u000a      research (1995-2013) on the relationships between intimate and conflict\u000a      violence and her meticulous comparative research on truth commissions\u000a      (with Turner) documents the gender pitfalls in truth recovery and offers\u000a      roadmaps on how to avoid them.\u000a    Building on the importance of individual experiences, Hamber's work on\u000a      psychological and communal trauma reveals how important it is for victims\u000a      to be able to contextualise their experience within the broader political\u000a      context, and it advocates healing through the integration of legal and\u000a      non-legal approaches. Hamber relies on his extensive empirical research in\u000a      NI and South Africa (1995-2009). Campbell &amp; Turner's research on truth\u000a      commissions was part of a project (2001-8) that applied TJ analysis to NI\u000a      before it became mainstream to do so. It led to a series of peer-reviewed\u000a      articles e.g. MLR (2003) and HRQ (2005). Key insights of the underpinning\u000a      research include analysing how truth commissions can use social science\u000a      methodologies to build on individual testimonies to identify patterns of\u000a      violence. This demonstrates one way in which truth commissions can help\u000a      individuals locate their experiences within the political context.\u000a      Rooney's work (2004-13) singularly adapts the critical theory of\u000a      intersectionality and applies it to identity and community schisms in\u000a      divided and politically violent societies. The underpinning research is\u000a      unique in its translation of high-level theorising enmeshed in the\u000a      practical realities and experiences of community-level application. Such\u000a      methodologies were influential in TJI's collaboration with Duffy and have\u000a      been given practical application in Rooney's Transitional Justice\u000a        Grassroots Toolkit. By giving scholarly voice to the most\u000a      marginalised, TJI research has consistently emphasised that their\u000a      inclusion in truth recovery is essential to avoid intergenerational\u000a      violence and trauma.\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Key Researchers\u000a          Position at time of research\u000a          Dates Joining or Departing\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Campbell, C.\u000a          Professor\u000a          Joined 2000\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Hamber, B.\u000a          Professor\u000a          Joined 2007\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          N&#237; Aol&#225;in, F.\u000a          Professor\u000a          Joined 2000\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Rolston, B.\u000a          Professor\u000a          Joined 2005\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Rooney, E.\u000a          Senior Lecturer\u000a          Joined 2005\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Turner, C.\u000a          Research Assistant and Lecturer\u000a          Joined 2004 - departed 2013\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"547","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1966436","Name":"East Timor"},{"GeoNamesId":"831053","Name":"Kosovo"},{"GeoNamesId":"433561","Name":"Burundi"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    TJI's gender research has contributed to the work of United Nations\u000d\u000a      bodies, national government departments and local and international civil\u000d\u000a      society organisations.

The study frames a UN wide\u000d\u000a        system-guidance note setting the approach of agencies, field officers\u000d\u000a        and key decisionmakers to reparations and GBV. The study required\u000d\u000a        consistent interface with UN agencies and field offices in conflict\u000d\u000a        sites, providing expert advice and guidance on a range of post-conflict\u000d\u000a        gender issues. Users are UN officials at Headquarters and field office\u000d\u000a        levels, with beneficiaries being the victims of conflict-related sexual\u000d\u000a        violence in multiple sites. Valji notes that UN Women use `the Study to\u000d\u000a        produce Guidelines for use in the field by UN Women and OHCHR in respect\u000d\u000a        to the management of reparations for conflict-related sexual violence.\u000d\u000a        From the UN perspective, such Studies and Guidelines constitute\u000d\u000a        authoritative legal standards'. All three scholars remain in close\u000d\u000a        contact with UN Women on the content and operation of the Guidelines\u000d\u000a        (Swaine as in-house consultant post completion of her doctoral research\u000d\u000a        at TJI). Valji also confirms that research connecting intimate and\u000d\u000a        conflict violence by McWilliams &amp; N&#237; Aol&#225;in (2013) has been widely\u000d\u000a        shared and is being deployed by UN Women.\u000d\u000a      The influential 2010 Women's Participation in Peacebuilding:\u000d\u000a          Report of the Secretary-General setting out the UN System's\u000d\u000a        Seven-Point Action Plan on Gender-Responsive Peacebuilding cites and\u000d\u000a        relies directly on Bell and O'Rourke's formative empirical study.\u000d\u000a        Report's commitment section draws un-amended on the underpinning\u000d\u000a        research. Bell engaged directly with UN Women and spent time at UN\u000d\u000a        Headquarters in New York to enable the Report's completion.\u000d\u000a      The influence of TJI Scholars on the CEDAW Committee's General Comment\u000d\u000a        No 30 (2013) (GC) has been substantial. The GC establishes CEDAW's\u000d\u000a        judicial approach, setting legally binding international standards\u000d\u000a        regarding women's rights in armed conflict and afterwards. In advance of\u000d\u000a        the GC being issued, the CEDAW Committee issued a Concept Note (2011).\u000d\u000a        Bell and O'Rourke were invited to submit a framing memorandum drawing on\u000d\u000a        their conflict and post-conflict research. N&#237; Aol&#225;in was requested to\u000d\u000a        make her gender and conflict publications generally available to all\u000d\u000a        CEDAW Committee members. TJI scholars Ni Aol&#225;in, Rooney, Bell &amp;\u000d\u000a        O'Rourke are cited in the Concept Note. N&#237; Aol&#225;in had sustained\u000d\u000a        communication with the GC author throughout 2012-2013. The GC adopts key\u000d\u000a        insights from TJI gender research including the connections between\u000d\u000a        intimate and conflict-related violence, the relationship between gender\u000d\u000a        inequality and gender violence in conflict settings, the modalities of\u000d\u000a        engaging women's leadership in peacemaking, and the required\u000d\u000a        applicability of gender norms to non-state actors.

N&#237; Aol&#225;in's research supported the design of training and\u000d\u000a          guidance for USAID officers overseeing assistance in post-conflict\u000d\u000a          states. OCM training on post-conflict gender issues is benchmarked\u000d\u000a          internally against N&#237; Aol&#225;in's models. OCM attests to sustained use of\u000d\u000a          On the Frontlines `in all USAID's gender-related policies'\u000d\u000a          particularly as they are operationalised to give support to field\u000d\u000a          offices. It also confirms adoption of the `gender centrality' approach\u000d\u000a          conceptualised in On the Frontlines to address gender needs in\u000d\u000a          post-conflict settings.\u000d\u000a        Hamber has a sustaining relationship with the Task Force on Dealing\u000d\u000a          with the Past and the Prevention of Atrocities in the Swiss Federal\u000d\u000a          Dept. of Foreign Affairs. He has given advice, engaged in training and\u000d\u000a          provided expertise. His masculinities research has had particular\u000d\u000a          influence, framing the approach of the division to addressing the\u000d\u000a          gender terrain of post-conflict reconstruction and its multilateral\u000d\u000a          decisions as a donor state.\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a      Gender and Conflict in Northern Ireland: Transforming Conflict\u000d\u000a            and Intimate Violence\u000d\u000a        TJI staff have long influenced practice and policy with regard to\u000d\u000a        women's lives in NI. McWilliams was and remains the key intellectual and\u000d\u000a        policy figure in the women's movement, conceptualising and devising\u000d\u000a        policy through multiple and overlapping roles. McWilliams' (1993) study\u000d\u000a        has been pivotal to the discourses and practice related to domestic\u000d\u000a        violence in NI. Her ability to translate academic research into policy\u000d\u000a        imperatives was enabled by holding pivotal institutional roles from 1996\u000d\u000a        onwards directly integrating GBV, gendered truth and gendered security\u000d\u000a        research to shaping political and policy agendas including as co-founder\u000d\u000a        of NI Women's Coalition; negotiator for NI Peace Agreement; Chief\u000d\u000a        Commissioner of NI Human Rights Commission; member of Prison Reform\u000d\u000a        Security Panel. McWilliams was short-listed as UN Special Rapporteur on\u000d\u000a        the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of\u000d\u000a        non-recurrence in 2012, which is indicative of her broad national and\u000d\u000a        international research\/policy influence.

In addition, the current Director of the\u000d\u000a        Department of Justice NI confirms the influence of McWilliams' prior and\u000d\u000a        current research on the Courts and Tribunal Service as regards their\u000d\u000a        approach to the prosecution of domestic violence and its conflict\u000d\u000a        dimensions. McWilliams also advances implementation of her research\u000d\u000a        findings on intimate and conflict violence with police, prosecution, and\u000d\u000a        probation services in NI through direct engagement, consultation, as\u000d\u000a        well as directly facilitating local women's NGOs positioning.\u000d\u000a      ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Transitional Justice Institute's (TJI) work on gender, conflict and\u000d\u000a      transition demonstrates remarkable international impact, showing effects\u000d\u000a      and benefits to institutional norms and policies, civil society\u000d\u000a      positioning and legal enforcement at the state level.

Sustained international exposure of systematic\u000d\u000a      gender harms during the Balkan wars of the 1990s gave rise to strategic\u000d\u000a      feminist interventions aimed at redirecting international criminal law and\u000d\u000a      the law of armed conflict to reveal and criminalise sexual violence in\u000d\u000a      conflict situations. In parallel, given women's sustained marginalisation\u000d\u000a      from political power, feminists sought to ensure opportunities were\u000d\u000a      created to address and integrate gendered experiences directly into peace\u000d\u000a      negotiations and transitions.\u000d\u000a    The field of transitional justice (TJ) emerged with little conceptual or\u000d\u000a      practical concern for women's rights and experiences. In the past decade,\u000d\u000a      led by TJI scholars, gender analysis of TJ broadly framed as well as of\u000d\u000a      conflict, transition and reconstruction has blossomed. TJI scholars have\u000d\u000a      deepened their vision of gendering TJ by addressing other harms, such as\u000d\u000a      the impact of conflict on family relationships and socioeconomic harms.\u000d\u000a      TJI maintains the strongest group of internationally recognised scholars\u000d\u000a      researching the intersection of gender, conflict and transition. TJI was\u000d\u000a      the first scholarly and policy entity to integrate gender systematically\u000d\u000a      into TJ analysis and practice, making it an intellectual and policy leader\u000d\u000a      in the global development of the field. TJI scholars have led a field\u000d\u000a      reorientation exploring the gender dimensions of the design, operations\u000d\u000a      and impact of key TJ mechanisms (e.g. trials, truth commissions,\u000d\u000a      reparations, institutional reform). These research concerns are\u000d\u000a      increasingly being reflected in national and international policymaking,\u000d\u000a      evidenced by the growing number of UN Security Council resolutions (e.g.\u000d\u000a      1325) relating to women's experiences of conflict and transition.\u000d\u000a    Since its creation in 2003 TJI has addressed gender and post-conflict\u000d\u000a      issues in Northern Ireland (NI) through sustained engagements with the\u000d\u000a      women's sector.

TJI has organised and participated in conferences,\u000d\u000a      educational events, information sharing and policy planning processes\u000d\u000a      addressing the post-conflict environment including: truth recovery,\u000d\u000a      institutional reform, reproductive rights, and gender-based violence\u000d\u000a      (GBV).

TJI's Annual Gender Summer School has also been a\u000d\u000a      key mechanism to transmit TJI research to local and international\u000d\u000a      activists and to build capacity within the local sector.\u000d\u000a    Impactful Research Insights\u000d\u000a    TJI research on gender, conflict and transition has produced multiple,\u000d\u000a    influential research insights on the nature of the harms experienced by\u000d\u000a    women during conflict, the continuities of harms that endure into the\u000d\u000a    transitional period, and the ways in which women should be involved\u000d\u000a    remedying harms and preventing their repetition. For example, McWilliams'\u000d\u000a    (with McKiernan) 1993 study of domestic violence during the NI conflict\u000d\u000a    provides the only comprehensive empirically based scholarly analysis in any\u000d\u000a    conflict\/post-conflict setting of the relationship between armed actors,\u000d\u000a    conflict violence and intimate violence. Recent work by McWilliams &amp; N&#237;\u000d\u000a    Aol&#225;in (2013) updates and reframes earlier studies by accounting for the\u000d\u000a    transitional dimensions of intimate partner violence.\u000d\u000a    Hamber's work on masculinity presented nuanced understandings of how\u000d\u000a      masculinities arise in transitional states, identified the relationships\u000d\u000a      between violent masculinities produced through conflict, and exposed the\u000d\u000a      continuities of violence experienced by women in transition.\u000d\u000a    In their systematic analysis of peace agreements Bell &amp; O'Rourke\u000d\u000a      documented references to women in peace agreements, finding persistent\u000d\u000a      historical absence but identifying that UN Security Resolution 1325 had\u000d\u000a      triggered improvements. This finding informed debates on the effectiveness\u000d\u000a      of UN Security Council resolutions and it cast light on barriers to UNSC\u000d\u000a      effectiveness. O'Rourke's monograph comparatively addresses women's\u000d\u000a      engagement and exclusion in advocacy, agitation and representation\u000d\u000a      illustrating the gender gap in many TJ processes. Her comparative insights\u000d\u000a      on reparations practices sharpen feminist approaches to reparation in\u000d\u000a      post-conflict sites. N&#237; Aol&#225;in's (with Haynes &amp; Cahn) On the\u000d\u000a        Frontlines contends that addressing women's needs after conflict is\u000d\u000a      fundamental to ensuring sustainable peace. The authors propose concrete\u000d\u000a      recommendations going beyond gender mainstreaming towards `gender\u000d\u000a      centrality' in peacemaking and peace enforcement. This novel concept\u000d\u000a      emphasises that women's needs, equality and autonomy must be at the centre\u000d\u000a      of peacebuilding measures from beginning to end of conflict resolution\u000d\u000a      processes.\u000d\u000a    Outline of Underpinning Research\u000d\u000a      McWilliams has a long-standing scholarly and practitioner engagement with\u000d\u000a      intimate partner violence and women's rights. Among her publications on\u000d\u000a      these themes, her 1993 study, commissioned by the Department of Health and\u000d\u000a      Social Services, entailed a comprehensive empirical analysis and remains\u000d\u000a      the empirical benchmark in the field. Recent work with N&#237; Aol&#225;in (2013)\u000d\u000a      analyses qualitative data from interviews conducted in 2009-12. Hamber's\u000d\u000a      long-term research on masculinity resulted from an underpinning\u000d\u000a      multi-country study (NI, Lebanon and South Africa) addressing the role of\u000d\u000a      women and men in post-conflict society by examining the gendered meanings\u000d\u000a      of security. O'Rourke's monograph addresses the women's movement in\u000d\u000a      sustained comparative perspective (Chile, Colombia and NI). Her work with\u000d\u000a      Bell on peace processes provides gender analysis of negotiations and\u000d\u000a      outcomes for women based on a comprehensive database (188 treaties coded\u000d\u000a      and analysed), which formed part of a more extensive and long-term project\u000d\u000a      on peace agreements. N&#237; Aol&#225;in's research is resoundingly comparative,\u000d\u000a      drawing on extensive (10 country) site analysis and infused with a\u000d\u000a      strongly theoretical approach, bringing mainstream feminist theorising\u000d\u000a      directly to the post-conflict arena.\u000d\u000a    Details of Key Researchers\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          Key Researchers\u000d\u000a          Position\u000d\u000a              at time of research\u000d\u000a          Dates of Joining or\u000d\u000a              Departing\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          Hamber, B.\u000d\u000a          Professor\u000d\u000a          Joined 2007\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          McWilliams, M.\u000d\u000a          Professor\u000d\u000a          Joined 1978\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          N&#237; Aol&#225;in, F.\u000d\u000a          Professor\u000d\u000a          Joined 2000\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          O&#8217;Rourke, C.\u000d\u000a          Lecturer and Senior Lecturer\u000d\u000a          Joined 2009\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"548","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Activities and Impacts Achieved\u000a    All three examples evidence high quality published research prompting\u000a      non-academic users to seek TJI assistance with a variety of political\u000a      initiatives, revealing the extent to which TJI is an established `go to'\u000a      academic centre for knowledge of peace processes and transitional justice.\u000a    In the Basque peace process Hamber provided assistance to various Basque\u000a      agencies, e.g.\u000a    \u000a      He supported the development and implementation of the peace plan of\u000a        the former Basque President, Juan Jos&#233; Ibarretxe Markuartu. Hamber was\u000a        consulted at various stages of the process, and visited the region on\u000a        several occasions to share knowledge with NGOs, academic institutions\u000a        and government bodies. Hamber worked with the Basque government in\u000a        Konpondu Participatory Process (2007-8) aiming at bringing together all\u000a        political traditions into an inclusive dialogue, feeding directly into\u000a        the Basque government's Peace and Reconciliation Plan. Hamber's\u000a        expertise was considered so valuable that with the collaboration of\u000a        Basque government, his monograph was translated into Spanish. In his\u000a        testimonial, President Ibarretxe states Hamber's work `has had a\u000a        significant impact on the Basque peace process'.\u000a      In March 2013, Hamber participated in a social forum led by Lokarri, a\u000a        citizen network to promote peace, dialogue and reconciliation. The\u000a        contribution of Hamber and others enabled Lokarri to publish a series of\u000a        recommendations on the peace process. Hamber also supported the\u000a        preparation of Lokarri's publication on principles for reconciliation in\u000a        the Basque Country\u000a    \u000a    TJI ensures the sustainability of these relationships through partnership\u000a      with the Agirre Lehendakaria Center for Social and Political Studies, Uni.\u000a      Basque Country (founded by Ibarretxe) and a scholarship programme funded\u000a      by the Basque government for two students to participate in TJI's LLM. TJI\u000a      hosted workshops in 2004 and 2012 at the O&#241;ati International Institute for\u000a      the Sociology of Law, co-founded by the Basque government. Participants\u000a      included Basque politicians.\u000a    Based on her international scholarly reputation Bell was invited to\u000a      intervene in the Philippines peace process by Conciliation Resources (CR),\u000a      as her research was well known in the country (2006 AJIL article cited by\u000a      the Supreme Court). CR is a peacebuilding NGO and member of the\u000a      International Contact Group on Mindanao. Bell's engagement had multiple\u000a      stages and dimensions:\u000a    \u000a      She was commissioned by International Alert to write a report on the\u000a        law of peace made available to Conciliation Resources and circulated to\u000a        all key stakeholders before the site visit.\u000a      In April 2011, Bell was sponsored by the Norwegian government to visit\u000a        Manila and Cotabato (in Mindanao) where she discussed the applicability\u000a        of her research insights to the peace process in 16 meetings that were\u000a        attended by some 300 people. The visit's purpose was to expose different\u000a        audiences to reflections from a scholar-practitioner who has vast\u000a        academic and practical experiences in comparative analysis of peace\u000a        agreements. Participants in the meetings included: all the negotiating\u000a        parties of the government and the non-state armed groups: Moro Islamic\u000a        Liberation Front (MILF) and National Democratic Front of the Philippines\u000a        (NDFP). The chief government negotiator held a direct second meeting to\u000a        explore further Bell's ideas. Other participants were regional\u000a        governors, the Supreme Court; national Defence College and International\u000a        Monitoring Team (a peacekeeping force); civil society organisations in\u000a        Cotabato; embassy staff from multiple countries; and Judges of the\u000a        Supreme Court. Evidence supplied by CR confirms their view that the trip\u000a        was `a big success' and government and the MILF peace panels expressed\u000a        their satisfaction.\u000a      Bell also met the Negotiating Panel of the National Democratic Front\u000a        of the Philippines in Utrecht (31 May 2011). As the testimonial email\u000a        from International Alert notes that `The meeting with the NDFP\u000a        negotiating panel was significant since it was probably the first time\u000a        they discussed the possible constitutional ramifications of a potential\u000a        peace agreement'\u000a    \u000a    As the CR testimonial notes, Bell's work continues to be cited by both\u000a      sides in peace process and by civil society groups, and has become `an\u000a      important reference for the Mindanao peace negotiations'. In 2013, TJI\u000a      welcomed Yasmin Nao (a member Government Peace Negotiating Panel) as a\u000a      summer school student and arranged for her to have series of private\u000a      meetings with women involved in the NI peace process.\u000a    Amnesties are used during or after conflicts around the world to\u000a      encourage combatants to surrender and disarm, to facilitate peace\u000a      agreements and to incentivise combatants to engage with TJ processes.\u000a      Uganda provides one of the most high profile examples of amnesties being\u000a      used during a conflict. Prior to joining TJI, Mallinder conducted\u000a      fieldwork in Uganda and produced an open access report on amnesty,\u000a      conflict resolution and TJ in Uganda that has been viewed 878 times.\u000a      During 2011, there were extensive local debates on the role of war crimes\u000a      prosecutions and amnesty for armed groups fighting the government,\u000a      including the Lord's Resistance Army. On the basis of her international\u000a      expertise on amnesty and knowledge of the local context, a series of local\u000a      actors consulted Mallinder resulting in the following activities:\u000a    \u000a      She participated in a training programme for judges from the\u000a        International Crimes Division and Constitutional Court on the legal\u000a        status of amnesties in June 2011. Her presentation explored the status\u000a        of amnesties under international criminal law and the case law of\u000a        national and international courts. It questioned the emergence of a\u000a        prohibition on amnesties for international crimes. The Constitutional\u000a        Court does not generally cite academic research but Mallinder's approach\u000a        was reflected in the court's decision in the leading Kwoyelo case.\u000a      In 2012, she engaged in a consultation led by the Ugandan Coalition of\u000a        the ICC (UCICC) and HURINET-U. This required Mallinder to take the\u000a        findings from her research on how amnesties can link to other forms of\u000a        transitional justice and adapt them into a series of country-specific\u000a        briefs for non-academic audiences. One brief entitled `Implications of\u000a        the Expiry of the Amnesty Law' that was published in the UCICC's\u000a        magazine, The Forum (2012). Ndifuna's testimonial notes that\u000a        these engagements fostered discussion among stakeholders in Uganda on\u000a        the future form that the amnesty could take and recommendations proposed\u000a        by Mallinder were incorporated into a report for the Government of\u000a        Uganda, produced by the Justice Law and Order Sector's Transitional\u000a        Justice Working Group, which is composed of representatives of key\u000a        government departments. Responding to requests from the US State Dept,\u000a        Mallinder shared the brief on the expiry of the amnesty with American\u000a        policymakers.\u000a      Mallinder was asked to contribute to the research and drafting of\u000a        Advocats Sans Fronti&#232;res (ASF)'s report, `Amnesty: An Olive Branch in\u000a        Justice' (2012) The testimonial from ASF affirms that Mallinder's\u000a        contribution enabled ASF to identify loopholes in Uganda's amnesty legal\u000a        framework and to develop practical recommendations to ensure that\u000a        amnesty can contribute to peace and justice. This document was widely\u000a        used by local policymakers and civil society.\u000a      In 2013, the amnesty was reinstated and work has begun on drafting\u000a        comprehensive transitional justice legislation. Mallinder provided a\u000a        brief on the linkages between amnesty and TJ mechanisms for ASF as part\u000a        of the debates in Uganda on holistic TJ approaches.\u000a    \u000a    Evidence or Indicators\u000a    This case study demonstrates a range of activities to maximise impact on\u000a      difference audiences, and multiple types of evidence are used to\u000a      demonstrate the links between the underpinning research and impact\u000a      claimed.

However, the\u000a      Cold War's end focused greater international attention on transitions from\u000a      conflict and communal violence. This resulted from the endurance of\u000a      seemingly intractable wars and the need to respond to the disintegration\u000a      of fragile states. The perceived failure of Cold War peace agreements to\u000a      deliver lasting peace and address core grievances contributed to new\u000a      peacebuilding programmes emphasising longer-term projects to ensure\u000a      sustainable peace through transitional justice, amnesty and reconciliation\u000a      measures (e.g. Report of the Panel on UN Peace Operations 2000, and Report\u000a      of the Secretary-General on the Rule of Law and Transitional Justice in\u000a      Conflict and Post-Conflict Societies 2004). Concurrently, a revitalised\u000a      law of peace took on a new importance and vitality. The increased emphasis\u000a      on transitional justice reflected a recognition that claims over justice\u000a      often lie at the heart of conflict and must be addressed in negotiating\u000a      its end. Debates about amnesty, accountability and victims' rights are\u000a      some of the most significant, yet contentious, elements of peace\u000a      negotiations.\u000a    This context also motivated the establishment of a praxis-driven TJI in\u000a      2003, with the study of the relationship between justice and peace among\u000a      its core aims. Since its creation, TJI has played a leading role in\u000a      developing theory and practice that informed and shaped international\u000a      policy developments. Within Northern Ireland (NI), TJI and Law researchers\u000a      participated directly in the peace negotiations (e.g. McWilliams led the\u000a      Women's Coalition political party) and worked with stakeholders to\u000a      implement the terms of the agreements (e.g. O'Rawe worked with the PSNI on\u000a      the implementation of the Patten Report on Policing). TJI continues to\u000a      lead efforts to evaluate the implementation of the various NI peace\u000a      agreements (e.g. 2013 `Mapping the Rollback of the Belfast\/Good Friday\u000a      Agreement' conference co-sponsored with the Committee on the\u000a      Administration of Justice and Queen's University Belfast).\u000a      Internationally, TJI staff's expertise regularly prompts calls for our\u000a      engagement with international and foreign policymakers, mediators and\u000a      NGOs, advising on design, implementation and evaluation of peace\u000a      agreements and providing training for negotiators, judges, diplomats and\u000a      civil society activists. Within this REF cycle, TJI researchers have\u000a      worked with international mediators (e.g. Centre for Humanitarian\u000a      Dialogue) and have been involved in peace processes in Afghanistan (e.g.\u000a      McWilliams' training for women politicians and TJI's collaboration with\u000a      Afghan Analysts Network), Liberia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe (e.g. Moyo's work\u000a      with Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum), Bosnia, the Basque Country,\u000a      Philippines, Sierra Leone, Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and\u000a      Uganda. Information on our broader peace process engagement is available\u000a      on the TJI website. This case study illustrates how TJI has maximised the\u000a      impact of its research insights for non-academic users by exploring three\u000a      indicative examples: Hamber's engagement with the Basque peace process,\u000a      Bell's work in the Philippines and Mallinder's involvement in amnesty and\u000a      transitional justice debates in Uganda.\u000a    Impactful Research Insights\u000a    Where TJI researchers engage in peace processes, common themes that\u000a      motivate their work are elucidating legal obligations incumbent on states\u000a      during transitions with particular respect to justice claims, and\u000a      exploring how victims' rights can be balanced against the need for\u000a      political compromise. Hamber draws on his core disciplinary home in\u000a      psychology to identify the needs of individuals and communities\u000a      traumatised by conflict and to explore how victims' needs should be\u000a      addressed in peace agreements. In particular, he emphasises that these\u000a      needs extend beyond service delivery to encompass truth and justice\u000a      demands. Bell's work uniquely identifies three phases of peace\u000a      negotiations: pre-negotiation agreements, framework\/substantive agreements\u000a      and implementation\/renegotiation agreements. Her research stresses how\u000a      human rights strengthen peace processes at different stages and explores\u000a      ways in which negotiators can creatively implement human rights standards.\u000a      Mallinder's research shows how amnesties can be designed to fulfil states'\u000a      legal obligations and complement transitional justice programmes.\u000a    Outline of Underpinning Research\u000a    The origins of Hamber's research culminating in his monograph Transforming\u000a        Societies after Political Violence lie in his experiences of working\u000a      in and about the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission from\u000a      1995-2003. The monograph is based on 15 years of research and practical\u000a      experience in transitional sites. This considerable body of work also gave\u000a      rise to several journal articles, book chapters and other outputs. The\u000a      chapter listed below provides a synopsis of these broader findings by\u000a      reviewing the range and impacts of transitional justice mechanisms\u000a      commonly used in response to conflict, including trials, truth\u000a      commissions, and amnesties.\u000a    Bell's publications on peace agreements drew on the Peace Agreement\u000a      Database created by Bell &amp; O'Rourke (2000-8). It is hosted on the TJI\u000a      website and contains details of over 640 peace agreements signed since\u000a      1990, addressing conflicts that affect over 85 jurisdictions. Her\u000a      monograph brings together a body of work that began with her earlier book\u000a      Peace Agreements and Human Rights (2000) and continued through her\u000a      subsequent writing.\u000a    Mallinder's amnesty work began with her doctoral studies in 2003 for\u000a      which she created the Amnesty Law Database. This database contains\u000a      information on over 530 amnesties in 130 countries since 1945. This\u000a      database, inter alia, revealed examples of how amnesties can complement\u000a      efforts to reveal truth about violations, provide remedies to victims and\u000a      encourage combatants to disarm and reintegrate. Since joining TJI,\u000a      Mallinder has developed this work in a series of publications exploring\u000a      how amnesties can be designed to deliver accountability and charting the\u000a      evolution of international standards on the use of amnesties.\u000a    The research environment at TJI routinely fosters collaboration between\u000a      researchers working on peacebuilding. For example, Mallinder, Hamber and\u000a      Bell participated with other TJI colleagues (Hadden, Campbell) in the\u000a      development of the Guidelines on Amnesty and Accountability.\u000a    Details of Key Researchers\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Key Researchers\u000a          Position at time of\u000a              research\u000a          Dates of Joining or\u000a              Departing\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Bell, C.\u000a          Professor\u000a          Joined 2000 and departed 2011\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Hamber, B.\u000a          Professor\u000a          Joined July 2007\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Mallinder, L.\u000a          Lecturer and reader (from May 2012)\u000a          Joined 1 November 2009\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"549","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aa) Significantly influencing the work of NGOs holding transnational development\u000d\u000ainstitutions to account regarding gender equality. The research has provided significant\u000d\u000aresources, which have been relied upon by key activist and advocacy organizations to challenge\u000d\u000aconventional wisdom about development. For example:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000aSexuality Policy Watch. This Ford Foundation funded global forum of researchers and activists\u000d\u000aaims to contribute to sexuality-related global policy debates and to promote effective linkages\u000d\u000abetween local, regional and global campaigns for policy change. In 2009 the Rio de Janeiro-based\u000d\u000asecretariat commissioned Bedford to conduct research into a gender equality initiative of the World\u000d\u000aEconomic Forum (a group comprised of over 1,000 leading companies aiming to improve the world\u000d\u000aeconomy). The resource (source 1) was made available on the group's website and promoted in\u000d\u000atheir newsletter. It is underpinned by the analytic critique of gender equality statistics and sharing\u000d\u000amodels of coupledom developed in outputs 1 and 3. It highlights the transgressive uses to which\u000d\u000agender indexes can be put by development activists, while critiquing the limited measures of\u000d\u000awomen's empowerment being deployed in this instance. The resource has been used by SPW in\u000d\u000atheir campaigns to challenge the gender equality policies promoted by free market institutions such\u000d\u000aas the World Economic Forum: SPW notes that it made \"a wonderful contribution to this ongoing\u000d\u000aconversation [about gender equality in global economic debates] which calls attention to gaps and\u000d\u000apotential pitfalls of mainstream gender and development indicators\" (foreword to source 1).\u000d\u000a\u000aBretton Woods Project\/Action-Aid\/Oxfam. BWP, supported by Action Aid, is an advocacy group\u000d\u000aoffering oversight of, and a campaigning role relating to, the World Bank and International\u000d\u000aMonetary Fund. It invited Bedford to write a report for non-academics to stimulate debate about the\u000d\u000aBank's 2012 World Development Report on gender and to contribute to campaigns for a reformed\u000d\u000aapproach. This report (source 2), based on outputs 1, 2 and 3, was distributed widely (including to\u000d\u000a2,176 print subscribers and 8,321 electronic subscribers), and was regarded as a \"terrific\u000d\u000acontribution\" to debates on gender equality and unpaid care within development by the President\u000d\u000aof Gender Action (an international organization promoting gender justice in international financial\u000d\u000ainstitutions, source 3). Action Aid subsequently increased their work on unpaid care, and, in\u000d\u000acollaboration with Oxfam, hosted the London launch of the UN special rapporteur's report on\u000d\u000aunpaid care work and women's human rights, due to be submitted to the UN General Assembly in\u000d\u000aOctober 2013. Bedford was invited as one of three panel discussants at the official launch on the\u000d\u000agrounds that her research on the limits of gender sharing as a solution to care burdens would\u000d\u000aenable participants \"to get a different perspective\" (source 4).\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000ab) Advising global public policy bodies on sexuality and development. Bedford's research\u000d\u000ahas assisted organisations working towards poverty alleviation, enhanced social care provision,\u000d\u000aand gender equality within development. In particular, she was commissioned by the United\u000d\u000aNations Research Institute of Social Development (UNRISD) to investigate the relevance of\u000d\u000asexuality and diverse family formation to the 2009 meetings of the UN's Commission on the Status\u000d\u000aof Women meeting about care. The subsequent working paper (output 4) has been widely read\u000d\u000a(downloaded over 2,000 times between March 2010 and July 2013 (source 5); cited in a Human\u000d\u000aDevelopment Report research paper for UNDP (source 6); and publicised in the International\u000d\u000aCouncil on Social Welfare's European region Newsletter (March 2010). The research was a key\u000d\u000adriver in pushing international bodies like UNRISD to think more seriously about the unintended\u000d\u000aexclusions that can stem from development policies that rest on sharing coupledom as a normative\u000d\u000afoundation. In May 2013 Bedford was invited to speak in Mexico at an International Expert Meeting\u000d\u000aon Time Use and Unpaid Work, organized by UN Women, intended to guide the institution in\u000d\u000aeffective measurement of the economic value of unpaid care.\u000d\u000ac) Significant impact on teaching and professional practice. In 2011, Bedford was one of 14\u000d\u000ainternational experts invited to teach on the Certificate in Advanced Studies in Gender, Justice, and\u000d\u000aGlobalization (University of Bern), a course for professionals in the fields of development, national\u000d\u000aand international government, teaching, and the media, where she drew heavily on outputs 1 and 4\u000d\u000ato discuss the institutional constraints within which transnational feminist policy entrepreneurs\u000d\u000aoperate. A summary of her World Bank research was also published in the Institute of\u000d\u000aDevelopment Studies bulletin for development practitioners (source 7), and a non-academic\u000d\u000asummary of her Commission on the Status of Women research was published in the journal\u000d\u000aReproductive Health Matters in 2011 (this journal, translated into seven languages, is distributed\u000d\u000afree to 3,500 individuals, groups and organisations in the Global South).\u000d\u000aBedford has also been invited to address and inform representatives of policy making bodies,\u000d\u000aincluding at a workshop on sexuality and development in Brighton (April 2008); an event on\u000d\u000achallenging the development industry in Cape Town (August 2009), and a panel on masculinities\u000d\u000aconvened at the House of Commons by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Trade and Aid\u000d\u000a(November 2009). These activities have been grounded in a long-standing relationship with the\u000d\u000asexuality and development group at the Institute of Development Studies, a stakeholder hub that\u000d\u000abrings together development funders, policymakers, NGOs, and academics and that includes\u000d\u000amany members who campaign for policy change around gender and sexuality in development.\u000d\u000aIn May 2013, Bedford was asked to serve as one of two experts (along with the Senior\u000d\u000aInternational Officer for Stonewall) on the advisory board for the Sexuality, Law and Poverty\u000d\u000asegment of a four-year, &#163;11.1 million Department For International Development (DFID)\u000d\u000aAccountable Grant given to the Institute of Development Studies (IDS). The grant will fund advice\u000d\u000ato both the UK and the global development community in seven key policy areas. The sexuality\u000d\u000aarea received &#163;1.25 million, the largest amount ever awarded by DFID to research the links\u000d\u000abetween sexuality and development. Bedford's work is widely cited in the outputs produced from\u000d\u000athe stream so far (i.e. source 8), and, drawing on her research, she has advised the coordinators of\u000d\u000athe sexuality theme on several key issues, including the importance of ensuring effective links\u000d\u000abetween gender research and sexuality research; the value of a legally pluralist approach to\u000d\u000aexploring norms about gender and sexuality in developing countries and the limits of mainstream\u000d\u000apolicy approaches to the links between sexuality and poverty (all outputs). Particularly significant\u000d\u000aaspects of Bedford's research in her engagements with development practitioners, including those\u000d\u000awithin IDS, include her analysis of the relationship between sharing coupledom and neoliberalism\u000d\u000aand her critique of assumptions that poor and racialized men are especially violent. For example,\u000d\u000aher research has been used by development practitioner and gender activist Alan Grieg (IDS) in a\u000d\u000aUN-funded project done in collaboration with local NGOs in India, Kenya, and Uganda to mobilise\u000d\u000amen to challenge gender-based violence in institutions (source 9). Bedford was consulted on the\u000d\u000aresearch design for this initiative and gave feedback on a draft programme evaluation, using her\u000d\u000aresearch to support this key example of intersectional programming on men's issues.\u000d\u000ad) Sustained broader influence on critical public debate. Bedford's research has made an\u000d\u000ainfluential contribution to campaigns which have generated, shaped and informed critical public\u000d\u000adebate about sexuality and development and has improved democratic participation in such debate\u000d\u000a(including by reaching out to new stakeholders). For example, her research has been used to\u000d\u000aenhance public engagement about sexuality and development via you-tube, as part of IDS's\u000d\u000aPathways to Women's Empowerment project (source 10). She initiated a policy and activist debate\u000d\u000aabout economic justice and sexuality at the Barnard Center for Research on Women (see\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/bcrw.barnard.edu\/publications\/toward-a-vision-of-sexual-and-economic-justice), co-organizing a public lecture (attended by over 300 people) and a colloquium bringing together\u000d\u000apeople working on global economic justice and global sexual justice in late 2007. Drawing on\u000d\u000acontributions from artists, public intellectuals, and development practitioners, she co-edited a\u000d\u000aspecial issue of The Scholar and the Feminist Online (source 11) in 2008. This provides \"a forum\u000d\u000afor scholars, activists, and artists whose work articulates the ever-evolving role of feminism in\u000d\u000astruggles for social justice\" and is widely read (while no data is gathered on specific pages viewed,\u000d\u000afrom May 2012-July 2013 the journal as a whole had 127,000 page views from 152 countries).\u000d\u000aBedford's introduction, based partly on analysis developed in output 1, discusses the conceptual\u000d\u000afoundations for better collaboration between sexual and economic justice activism. This\u000d\u000aintervention significantly shaped the direction of subsequent work with activists. For example, the\u000d\u000asuccess of the initiative on sexual and economic justice led the organisers of a later event on\u000d\u000adomestic work (done in collaboration with activist groups), to centre \"intimate labor\" as a key\u000d\u000amobilizing concept. It also resulted in a follow-up, 2013 initiative on gender, justice, and neoliberal\u000d\u000atransformations featuring photo and video activism on sexual violence. Again, these activities show\u000d\u000aBedford's work as a strong influence in advancing critical debates in the area.\u000d\u000aIn sum, Bedford has worked closely and collaboratively with leading stakeholders in gender and\u000d\u000adevelopment policy over an extended period, and has played a key, ongoing role in foregrounding\u000d\u000aand advancing recognition of the importance of attention to sexuality in its formulation. Her work\u000d\u000ahas also been used by diverse activists, in many countries, who are challenging policy orthodoxy.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aDr Kate Bedford's work has demonstrated the limits of existing frameworks for addressing gender\u000d\u000aand sexuality in development policy and has had a significant impact in four main ways. First, it\u000d\u000ahas supported and influenced the work of the major NGOs (including Sexuality Policy Watch, and\u000d\u000athe Bretton Woods Project\/Action Aid) in holding development institutions to account on questions\u000d\u000aof gender equality. Second, it has had substantial influence on the work of transnational public\u000d\u000abodies (including UNRISD), challenging conventional wisdom and stimulating debate among\u000d\u000apolicymakers. Third, it has had considerable impact on how development practitioners are taught,\u000d\u000ain the UK and beyond. Finally, it has enjoyed a sustained influence in shaping a new area of\u000d\u000acritical public debate, improving public understanding of sexuality and development and engaging\u000d\u000adiverse international audiences. In the light of increased global attention to gender and\u000d\u000adevelopment (evident across several leading international institutions), Bedford's research has\u000d\u000astimulated important debate about policy orthodoxy and has directly influenced several campaigns\u000d\u000afor policy change.\u000d\u000a","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000aUniversity of Kent\u000d\u000a","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Kent (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Kent","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007150}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661552","Name":"Bern"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a\u000a1.

In\u000d\u000aevidence to a House of Lords Constitution Committee's inquiry into the Judicial Appointment\u000d\u000aProcess (November 2011), Lady Hale noted, despite having been initially `quite sceptical' as to\u000d\u000awhether a more diverse judiciary would make a difference to the outcome of cases, that the `very\u000d\u000ainteresting' Feminist Judgments collection demonstrated that it might do so, telling Committee\u000d\u000amembers that the best answer she could give on this question was: `go and read that book' (source\u000d\u000a2). In its March 2012 report on Judicial Appointments, the House of Lords Constitution Committee\u000d\u000acited Feminist Judgments as evidence for the proposition that `[a] more diverse judiciary can bring\u000d\u000adifferent perspectives to bear on the development of the law and to the concept of justice itself'\u000d\u000a(source 2), which in turn supported its conclusion that `a more diverse judiciary would not\u000d\u000aundermine the quality of our judges and would increase public trust and confidence in the\u000d\u000ajudiciary', and its recommendations for a series of measures to improve the diversity of the\u000d\u000ajudiciary.\u000d\u000ab) Impact on critical debate and reflection on feminism and judging\u000d\u000aIn her Foreword to Feminist Judgments, Lady Hale observed that `lawyers and judges...have so\u000d\u000amuch to learn from reading this book'. In a subsequent public lecture she observed that the book\u000d\u000aprovides `objective evidence' that a feminist perspective can make a difference `not only on so-\u000d\u000acalled \"women's issues\", but on the whole range of legal issues which may come before the courts'\u000d\u000a(source 3). Other judges similarly report that the FJP has influenced their thinking: for example, an\u000d\u000aAustralian judge wrote that it `has inspired and will challenge me here also' (source 6). The\u000d\u000aeminent, recently retired Court of Appeal judge, Sir Stephen Sedley, wrote in a review that the\u000d\u000a`highly original' exercise of the FJP provided a `rich illustration' of the utility of taking seriously a\u000d\u000afeminist approach to difficult legal cases (source 7). A conference held in May 2011, `Feminist\u000d\u000aJudgments: Next Steps', also saw a number of judges debating the implications of the project,\u000d\u000aincluding Sir Terence Etherton (Court of Appeal), Dame Laura Cox (High Court), Siobhan McGrath\u000d\u000a(Senior President of Residential Property Tribunals) and Catriona Jarvis (Upper Tribunal,\u000d\u000aImmigration and Asylum Chamber).\u000d\u000aProminent legal practitioners participating in the debate at the same conference included Vera\u000d\u000aBaird QC, Catherine Briddick (Senior Legal Officer, Rights of Women), and Amelia Nice (barrister,\u000d\u000aGreat James Street Chambers). In October 2011, the Interlaw Diversity Forum (an LGBT networks\u000d\u000ainitiative) organised an evening seminar on the FJP at Norton Rose LLP which was attended by\u000d\u000aover 100 professionals from city law firms, accounting firms, banks, and regulatory bodies. The\u000d\u000aevent was very enthusiastically received and generated excellent feedback (source 6), as well as\u000d\u000atwo articles in The Lawyer magazine (source 4). Feminist Judgments was favourably discussed in\u000d\u000athe Law Society Gazette (by the prominent legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg) and the Equal\u000d\u000aOpportunities Review (source 4) and in a number of legal Blogs, including the UK Human Rights\u000d\u000aBlog, Human Rights in Ireland, Lords of the Blog: Life and Work in the House of Lords, Pink Tape\u000d\u000aBlog (a blog concerning life at the family law bar) and SLAW (Canada) (source 4).\u000d\u000aThe FJP has also been relied on by NGOs in their work on women's equality before the law. The\u000d\u000aWomen's Resource Centre contacted Hunter in connection with the FJP and asked her to\u000d\u000acontribute to the CEDAW shadow report for the UK on equality before the law (source 6). The\u000d\u000ashadow report describes the FJP as demonstrating `best practice' in promoting judicial diversity\u000d\u000aand urges that the project be supported and emulated (source 5). This report will be considered\u000d\u000aalongside the UK government's report by the UN CEDAW Committee in late 2013. UNIFEM (now\u000d\u000aUN Women) also consulted Hunter on the issue of gender and judging in the context of preparation\u000d\u000aof the latest edition of their biennial publication Progress of the World's Women, and cited her\u000d\u000aarticle `Can Feminist Judges Make a Difference?' in the 2011-12 report (source 5).\u000d\u000aAn article in the Guardian Online by Erika Rackley stimulated a lively public discussion about\u000d\u000afeminism and judging and was re-tweeted or shared on Facebook over 100 times (source 4). BBC\u000d\u000aR4 `Woman's Hour' featured discussion of the FJP in December 2010 in an item in which Clare\u000d\u000aMcGlynn debated the merits of feminist judging with Baroness Ruth Deech, and again in May\u000d\u000a2011, when Erika Rackley joined a discussion on `Is Justice Influenced by Gender?'. The Pod\u000d\u000aAcademy, an independent platform for broadcasts on academic research which `aims to inform\u000d\u000apublic debate and uncover intriguing and challenging new ideas' commissioned a podcast on the\u000d\u000aFJP which incorporates comments by Lady Hale from the Norton Rose seminar, and interviews\u000d\u000awith Hunter and Rosemary Auchmuty (Reading) by barrister and novelist Elizabeth Woodcraft\u000d\u000a(source 4).\u000d\u000ac) Impact on teaching and students\u000d\u000aThe results of the FJP have been used in teaching in over 20 universities in the UK, France, South\u000d\u000aAfrica and Australia in this REF period, on compulsory and optional LLB modules, LLM\u000d\u000aprogrammes and other M-Level courses (e.g. MSc in Socio-Legal Studies, MSc in Healthcare\u000d\u000aEthics). The reach of this impact is not confined to specialist law and gender modules but extends\u000d\u000ato a far broader range of subjects, reflecting the diversity of legal cases tackled in the judgments\u000d\u000a(e.g. Criminal Law, Statutory Interpretation, Civil Liberties, Jurisprudence, Law and Commercial\u000d\u000aRelationships, Family Law). In these modules, the feminist judgments variously demonstrate to\u000d\u000astudents how feminist ideas may be implemented in legal practice, provoke students to think\u000d\u000acritically about judicial decision-making, and illustrate different possibilities for the development of\u000d\u000alegal doctrine (source 1). Further funding was obtained by two project participants (including Carr,\u000d\u000aKent) from the UK Centre for Legal Education to develop teaching materials based on the FJP, and\u000d\u000athese are available through the FJP website, and have in turn generated teaching-related\u000d\u000apublications including a special issue of The Law Teacher (46(3) 2012). The impact of the FJP in\u000d\u000ateaching has also extended as far as the A-level school curriculum, with Hunter invited by the\u000d\u000aManaging Editor of Sociology Review (`The flagship magazine for A-level Sociology') to contribute\u000d\u000aan article on the FJP aimed at A-level students (source 8).\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThe Feminist Judgments Project put theory into practice by engaging in a real world exercise of\u000d\u000awriting feminist judgments in leading cases in English law. In doing so it demonstrated the value of\u000d\u000ajudicial diversity, the extent to which women's experiences and concerns continue to be poorly\u000d\u000areflected in law, and the contingency of appellate decision-making. It has had a significant impact\u000d\u000ain three major ways. First, it has made an important contribution to policy debates regarding the\u000d\u000avalue of judicial diversity; second, it has raised awareness and understanding among judges, legal\u000d\u000aprofessionals, NGOs and the wider public of the contribution of a feminist approach to judicial\u000d\u000adecision-making; and, third, it has had far-reaching benefits for teachers and students, both in the\u000d\u000aUK and internationally. While the FJP was a highly collaborative project (deriving much strength\u000d\u000afrom this fact), Professor Hunter's research played a distinct and major role in shaping it and she\u000d\u000ajointly led and co-ordinated its activities from Kent.

It epitomises the sustained collaborative approach to\u000d\u000aimpact activities described in the REF3a, bringing together a group of scholars and practitioners to\u000d\u000aput `theory into practice' by engaging in a `real world' exercise of writing feminist judgments,\u000d\u000asubject to the same constraints as appellate judges. It was funded by a peer-reviewed grant, won\u000d\u000aby Rosemary Hunter (Principal Investigator, Kent), Clare McGlynn and Erika Rackley (Co-\u000d\u000aInvestigators, Durham) and administered from Kent. It took as its starting point the observation\u000d\u000athat while feminist legal scholarship had thrived within universities, it had yet to make a significant\u000d\u000aimpact within the judiciary or on judicial thinking. The book that was the project's main output,\u000d\u000aFeminist Judgments: From Theory to Practice (2010, output 2), presented a series of 'missing'\u000d\u000afeminist judgments in key cases in English law, written as if emanating from the same or a higher\u000d\u000aappellate court and dealing with a broad range of substantive areas.\u000d\u000aThe conceptual underpinning for the FJP was provided by Hunter's (2008) article, `Can Feminist\u000d\u000aJudges Make a Difference?' (output 1), which was researched and written at Kent. Hunter argued\u000d\u000athat taking a feminist approach to judging does not violate the judicial norms of fairness,\u000d\u000aimpartiality, independence and decision-making according to law, and set out a series of\u000d\u000asuggestions as to how a feminist judge might approach her role. This article formed the basis for a\u000d\u000abriefing paper provided to the judgment-writers and discussed at an early FJP workshop on\u000d\u000amethodology. The paper and the article itself were then used as reference points by many of the\u000d\u000ajudgment-writers, as is reflected in the judgments ultimately produced.\u000d\u000aThe main findings of the FJP were that:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aFeminist judging is not merely possible within judicial constraints but can actually provide a\u000d\u000abetter way of meeting those requirements.\u000d\u000aJudicial decisions are highly contingent and lack inevitability: bias and habitual modes of\u000d\u000athought are deeply embedded within the existing common law.\u000d\u000a Women's experiences and concerns continue to be poorly reflected in law.\u000d\u000aThere is no singular feminist position available on the issues raised by a case and those taking\u000d\u000adifferent feminist theoretical approaches may arrive at different decisions.\u000d\u000aFeminist judges cannot always reach a preferred result within the bounds of the judicial role.\u000d\u000aThe particular feminist approach adopted by the judgment writer `makes a difference' in the\u000d\u000aspecific cases chosen for analysis.\u000d\u000aThe reasoning adopted in a judgment is at least as important as the result.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThe contributions to Feminist Judgments provide a practical demonstration of these findings. In\u000d\u000athe book, each judgment is accompanied by a commentary which renders the case accessible to a\u000d\u000anon-specialist audience. The commentary explains the original decision, its background and\u000d\u000adoctrinal significance, the issues it raises, and how the feminist judgment deals with them\u000d\u000adifferently. In addition, Hunter, McGlynn and Rackley contributed three substantial original chapters\u000d\u000aintroducing the project, explaining the idea of `feminist judging' (outputs 2a and b) and describing\u000d\u000athe craft of writing judgments. Two of the judgments (by Mackenzie, and Carr (with C. Hunter,\u000d\u000aYork), outputs 2c and d) were researched and written at Kent, as were four commentaries (by\u000d\u000aConaghan, Hunter (with Weait, Birkbeck), Sheldon, and Wightman). Other contributions came\u000d\u000afrom leading feminist academics and practising lawyers from the third sector, at the Bar and\u000d\u000atribunal chairs.

In October 2011, the Assembly published an initial discussion\u000d\u000apaper, which drew heavily on the work of Carr, Cowan and Hunter and quoted it directly as an\u000d\u000ainspiration for reform: \"2.1 The current state of the law is out of date, cumbersome, wastes\u000d\u000alandlord, tenant and court resources and places unnecessary obstacles in the way of the\u000d\u000aachievement of appropriate policy outcomes\" (source 1, citing output 3).\u000d\u000aIn recognition of the significance of their research to the Assembly's reform agenda, the Joseph\u000d\u000aRowntree Foundation then arranged for Carr, Cowan and Hunter to meet with the Assembly's\u000d\u000aHousing Directorate and their legislative personnel in November 2011. This meeting, described by\u000d\u000aa Project Manager for the Welsh Government as `immensely useful' (source 5) enabled a focused\u000d\u000adiscussion of the key research insights detailed in their joint research (focussing particularly on\u000d\u000aoutput 3), and assisted the development of Welsh law and policy. Issues discussed drew on a\u000d\u000arange of previous key research findings, including how the Law Commission's rental reform Bill\u000d\u000amight be updated to deal with the proportionality jurisdiction opened up as a result of Article 8,\u000d\u000aSchedule 1, Human Rights Act 1998 (output 3); leasehold reform (output 6); the problems of\u000d\u000avulnerable tenants facing automatic eviction (outputs 3 and 6), and the integration of co-operative\u000d\u000ahousing provision within a tenancy reform project.

This paper\u000d\u000aagain took its starting point from the body of research described above (outputs 1-5) (source 5).\u000d\u000aThe Consultation Paper is a substantive document, which accompanied advice to the Welsh\u000d\u000aMinister for Housing and Regeneration and informed the subsequent White Paper published in\u000d\u000aMay 2012 (source 3). The White Paper commits to legislation on tenancy reform, during the\u000d\u000alifetime of the Assembly (i.e. before 2016). In preparation for that legislation Carr was seconded to\u000d\u000athe Welsh Law Commission for six months (September 2012 - March 2013) to work on the project,\u000d\u000awriting a series of issue based memoranda and a report updating the Law Commission's\u000d\u000aproposals, placing them in the Welsh context, and engaging with the legal scope of devolution\u000d\u000a(which includes housing but not property law) (source 4). This is work for which she was\u000d\u000aconsidered by the Law Commission to be uniquely qualified (source 6). Her work is closely\u000d\u000ainformed by the body of research described above and made a very significant contribution to the\u000d\u000aadvice given to the Minister and the proposed legislation. In the 2013 White Paper (output 5),\u000d\u000awhich underpins the reform, she developed and extended that body of research. In particular, the\u000d\u000afollowing elements of the legislation closely reflect the insights that are developed in the research\u000d\u000aset out above:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThe need for distinct separation between social and market tenure (outputs 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6).\u000d\u000aAbolition of ground 8, the mandatory ground for possession currently available to housing\u000d\u000aassociation landlords (outputs 3 &amp; 5).\u000d\u000aExtension of succession provisions to carers (output 5).\u000d\u000aIncorporation of some of Scottish reforms to social housing tenure (modified in the light of\u000d\u000aexperience) (output 5).\u000d\u000aThe need to ensure that proposals are sensitive to the needs of supported housing and issues\u000d\u000aof domestic violence (outputs 2, 3, 5 &amp; 6).\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aCarr is also working closely with key stakeholders within Welsh housing and with Government\u000d\u000alawyers in Cardiff to ensure that the Report is responsive to their concerns, again drawing fully on\u000d\u000athe research insights described above in this process.\u000d\u000aThe senior civil servant responsible for the Welsh Assembly tenure reform process wrote to Carr\u000d\u000aand Cowan to offer formal thanks for the contribution which their research made in the reform\u000d\u000aprocess, and highlighting as key Carr's `knowledge of comparative tenure', `understanding of the\u000d\u000alegal context in which supported housing operates', ability `to draw on significant previous\u000d\u000aengagement with supported housing organisations in Wales' and role in helping to ensure that the\u000d\u000aRenting Homes White Paper takes account of all key developments in housing law subsequent to\u000d\u000athe publication of the Law Commission's report in 2006 (source 5). He explains:\u000d\u000a\"I particularly value the independence of an academic perspective against which a wide range\u000d\u000aof viewpoints, such as there are within the housing sector, can be validated ... your input has\u000d\u000aalready had a significant impact by stressing the importance of adopting a broad-ranging\u000d\u000aperspective on tenure reform, flagging reforms in other countries we could learn from and\u000d\u000ahighlighting issues that have arisen since the Law Commission's work that we might wish to\u000d\u000aaddress.\u000d\u000a... I would go so far as to say that, without that body of research and your on-hand expertise\u000d\u000awhenever I have required it, I would not have been able to develop the proposals as far as we\u000d\u000ahave been able to do so. Although the Consultation Paper did not explicitly refer to your body of\u000d\u000awork [as is normal practice with this type of document], it is evident from the terms of the paper\u000d\u000athat it formed the basis for it. For example, the following elements of the proposed legislation\u000d\u000aclosely reflect the insights developed in your research: Distinct separation between social and\u000d\u000amarket tenure; Abolition of ground 8, the mandatory ground for possession currently available to\u000d\u000ahousing association landlords; Extension of succession provisions to carers; incorporation of\u000d\u000asome Scottish reforms to social housing tenure (modified in the light of experience)\" (source 5).\u000d\u000aThe research has thus provided a direct inspiration for substantial reform of Welsh housing law,\u000d\u000ashaping the political agenda, colouring public debates and forming the basis for changes that will\u000d\u000aimpact very directly on the lives of approximately half a million people who are either tenants or\u000d\u000alandlords, as well as the work in this area of all Welsh councils and housing associations.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aWorking both individually and in collaboration with other researchers, Dr Helen Carr has produced\u000d\u000aa highly significant and original body of work dealing with questions of housing tenure.

A key insight has been to highlight the apparent legal dissonance\u000d\u000abetween different housing tenures which have grown up without cross-reference, leading to the\u000d\u000ahighly inequitable outcome that, despite uniform points of access to different tenures, rights and\u000d\u000aresponsibilities vary significantly depending on the apparently neutral choice of type of landlord\u000d\u000a(output 3). For example, the right to buy is limited to council housing although being in housing\u000d\u000aneed does not necessarily lead to such tenure but might lead to housing association or private\u000d\u000arenting. Shared ownership (where the tenant part buys\/part rents) presents particular problems in\u000d\u000alaw and policy without easy resolution (output 3). This body of research provides a compelling\u000d\u000acase for the need for reform and the various objectives that must inform it, including simplification,\u000d\u000auniformity across tenures, neutralising the politics of housing, and avoiding the diverse types (or\u000d\u000alayers) of housing tenure (outputs 1-4). Furthermore, the research has pointed out the diverse\u000d\u000alocations, bases and principles upon which housing rights can be adjudicated (output 3).\u000d\u000aTo consolidate and further extend their previous empirical and doctrinal scholarship, Carr (with\u000d\u000aCowan and Hunter) was commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Housing Market\u000d\u000aTaskforce to produce a substantial research paper (output 3). The research paper drew on and\u000d\u000adeveloped various aspects of Carr's earlier research, including: her earlier work for the Law\u000d\u000aCommission (see below), Carr and Hunter's scholarship on the concept of \"vulnerability\" (outputs 2\u000d\u000aand 6, with the latter output drawing upon research done earlier and written up for publication in\u000d\u000a2013); and Carr, Cowan and Hunter's British Academy funded research into the workings of private\u000d\u000alandlord associations (output 1). The JRF research paper consolidated and further developed this\u000d\u000aextensive and wide-ranging body of work, advancing a closely argued and highly original case for a\u000d\u000acoherent programme for housing tenure reform, premised on a rigorous analysis of different\u000d\u000aelements of risk in each area.\u000d\u000aCarr arrived in Kent in 2006, having previously worked closely with the Law Commission on\u000d\u000ahousing law reform from 2002 to 2006 (where she had co-authored two substantial working papers\u000d\u000aand one major Report on `Renting Homes'). Since arriving in Kent, she has greatly extended her\u000d\u000aresearch in this area, publishing a range of further pieces, which have made a distinct and material\u000d\u000acontribution to the impact described in this case study. In addition to making a full and equal\u000d\u000acontribution to the ideas, research and drafting of output 3, she has conducted further research\u000d\u000awhich highlights the complex and unintended outcomes of tenure reform (outputs 2 &amp; 4), and\u000d\u000aforegrounds the needs of vulnerable populations (outputs 2 and 6). During a recent secondment,\u000d\u000ashe has also written a major new Law Commission Report, which updates the original Law\u000d\u000aCommission proposals, builds on and extends the research insights highlighted above and\u000d\u000aexplains how they apply in the context of Welsh devolution and housing priorities.

The book provides a critical\u000d\u000a      perspective on the rules governing the exercise of the right to peaceful\u000d\u000a      protest in the UK and identifies a host of current issues and tensions. It\u000d\u000a      provides an extensive critical summary of Strasbourg case law on Article\u000d\u000a      11 (building on reference 3.3) &#8212; and is the first work to do so &#8212; and in\u000d\u000a      doing so, highlights where domestic law and practice might currently be\u000d\u000a      out of line. It is primarily a doctrinal critique, organised around five\u000d\u000a      \"themes\" or scenarios &#8212; the location of protest, peaceful communication,\u000d\u000a      direct action, police powers and private regulation &#8212; but with a host of\u000d\u000a      inter-disciplinary or socio-legal insights. It concludes with a call for a\u000d\u000a      Royal Commission and suggests terms of reference so providing a framework\u000d\u000a      for the debate to take place. Outcomes that his research identifies\u000d\u000a      include: the need for a single Protest Act, rather than a series of Public\u000d\u000a      Order Acts; a clear statutory guarantee of an individual's right\u000d\u000a      to peaceful protest; and a clear statutory definition of lawful \"peaceful\u000d\u000a      protest\" &#8212; encompassing incidental, insignificant or short-lived\u000d\u000a      disruption or obstruction distinct from illegitimate disruptive direct\u000d\u000a      action, aimed at preventing an activity taking place. His research also\u000d\u000a      supports the well-known \"law in books vs. law in action\" tension in the\u000d\u000a      area of protest as shown, for example, by his analysis of the differential\u000d\u000a      arrest rates for different UK police forces.\u000d\u000a    More recent research has provided critical insight into kettling, and its\u000d\u000a      case-law (reference 3.5) as well as highlighting the problems, tensions\u000d\u000a      and consequences thrown up by the \"privatised\" regulation of protest, with\u000d\u000a      a length (reference 3.2) outlining the consequences and problems &#8212; for\u000d\u000a      matters such as transparency, accountability, burden of costs and\u000d\u000a      \"equality of arms\" &#8212; when commercial targets utilise their civil rights\u000d\u000a      and remedies to restrict protest. The last theme of Mead's research\u000d\u000a      (references 3.1, 3.2 and 3.6) is an exploration of the effect on protest\u000d\u000a      of increasing privatisation and commercialisation of public space, at the\u000d\u000a      heart of the debates generated by the Occupy movement.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1811","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    United Kingdom\u000d\u000a    The UK Government's consultation document, A Competition Regime for\u000d\u000a        Growth, recommended that dishonesty be dropped and that a new cartel\u000d\u000a      offence be adopted. In justifying this recommendation it drew particular\u000d\u000a      attention to Stephan's survey study (reference 3.1), summarising and\u000d\u000a      discussing its key findings in one paragraph, stating that Stephan's 2007\u000d\u000a      working paper had found that only around six in ten people in Britain\u000d\u000a      believe that price-fixing is dishonest and two in ten people believe that\u000d\u000a      it is not. The consultation endorsed the conclusion that juries may not be\u000d\u000a      as ready to convict for an offence based on dishonesty as originally\u000d\u000a      hoped. (source 5(a) at para 6.14). This change in policy was supported by\u000d\u000a      the Office of Fair Trading. The Senior Director of the OFT's Cartels and\u000d\u000a      Criminal Enforcement Group, Ali Nikpay, made reference to Stephan's survey\u000d\u000a      paper in a policy speech setting out the reasons why the OFT supported\u000d\u000a      abandoning the dishonesty requirement, and explaining (source 5(c) at p\u000d\u000a      21) that Stephan's survey data demonstrated that most people did not see\u000d\u000a      price fixing as inherently dishonest. Ali Nikpay has subsequently\u000d\u000a      indicated (source 5(d)) that the survey was \"hugely influential in terms\u000d\u000a      of informing a change in UK competition policy\" and that it \"was relied\u000d\u000a      upon in making the case for reform in the Office of Fair Trading and the\u000d\u000a      Department of Business, Innovation and Skills... despite significant\u000d\u000a      opposition from business groups and practitioners.\"\u000d\u000a    The final reform is contained in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act\u000d\u000a      2013 which amends the current cartel offence in section 41(2) (see source\u000d\u000a      5(b)) by removing the requirement of dishonesty.\u000d\u000a    Australia and New Zealand\u000d\u000a    In 2007, the Australian government proposed draft legislation\u000d\u000a      criminalising cartel behaviour. It drew inspiration from the UK's offence\u000d\u000a      and included the same requirement of dishonesty. Stephan's public survey\u000d\u000a      study (in its CCP working paper form) was picked up by a number of\u000d\u000a      Australian academics and practitioners, notably Caron Beaton-Wells\u000d\u000a      (University of Melbourne) and Brent Fisse (Brent Fisse Lawyers, New South\u000d\u000a      Wales). In a submission made to the Australian government in March 2008\u000d\u000a      (commenting on the criminal offence proposed in the Exposure Draft Bill),\u000d\u000a      they cited the survey as lending empirical backing to their criticisms of\u000d\u000a      the proposed dishonesty element (source 5(e). pp 29 and 31), where they\u000d\u000a      say that \"even serious cartel misconduct may not be regarded as dishonest\u000d\u000a      by jurors\" and that this is in part due to jurors' lack of familiarity\u000d\u000a      with cartels, a point also made by Stephan.\u000d\u000a    A subsequent Australian Senate Standing Committee report on the\u000d\u000a      criminalisation of cartel behaviour (source 5(f). pp 22-23) supported a\u000d\u000a      move by the Australian government to omit dishonesty from their cartel\u000d\u000a      offence. In doing so, they quoted the main argument from the second study\u000d\u000a      (reference 3.2) to lend support to this move:\u000d\u000a    \"As Andreas Stephan from the University of East Anglia has observed:\u000d\u000a      `...[the dishonesty element has failed to harden attitudes] in the absence\u000d\u000a      of regular convictions and may be problematic because dishonesty\u000d\u000a      necessitates a contemporary moral judgement on the part of the jury and\u000d\u000a      therefore relies on attitudes being sufficiently hardened in the first\u000d\u000a      place'\"\u000d\u000a    The Trade Practices Amendment (Cartel Conduct and Other Measures) Bill\u000d\u000a      was ultimately enacted as the Competition and Consumer Act 2010,\u000d\u000a      introducing two cartel offences in sections 44ZZRD and 44ZZRE which are\u000d\u000a      not based on a standard of dishonesty, but place importance on\u000d\u000a      demonstrating knowledge or belief.\u000d\u000a    In July 2012, a reference to the survey work (references 3.1) was made\u000d\u000a      during a debate in the Parliament of New Zealand. There Raymond Huo MP\u000d\u000a      said (source 5(h), \"...the results of a 2008 survey of public attitudes in\u000d\u000a      the United Kingdom precisely mirrored the results of a similar survey\u000d\u000a      recently conducted in Australia - that is, there is substantial majority\u000d\u000a      support for the view that cartel conduct is unacceptable, but a minority\u000d\u000a      of that think that cartel conduct should be a criminal offence, and less\u000d\u000a      than a quarter think that individuals should be jailed for it. It is\u000d\u000a      difficult to see why public attitudes would differ greatly in New\u000d\u000a      Zealand.\" The debate was in the context of the passage of the New Zealand\u000d\u000a      Commerce (Cartels and Other Matters) Amendment Bill, which when enacted\u000d\u000a      will criminalise cartel behaviour.\u000d\u000a    The Rt Hon. Lord Justice Gross' Review of Disclosure in Criminal\u000d\u000a      Proceedings (September 2011) cited the paper published in the Criminal Law\u000d\u000a      Review (references 3.2), in his discussion of cartel cases (source 5(i)).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Stephan's research identifies difficulties with a dishonesty element in\u000d\u000a      the offence of agreeing to fix prices with a competitor.

This study consisted of a\u000d\u000a        public survey designed by Stephan. It was conducted by YouGov Plc in\u000d\u000a        March 2008, with funding from the ESRC Centre for Competition Policy\u000d\u000a        (CCP). A representative sample of 1,219 residents of Great Britain were\u000d\u000a        asked a series of questions online, to gauge their attitudes to cartel\u000d\u000a        practices and appropriate sanctions. The study gave some indication of\u000d\u000a        how a jury might respond to the prosecution of individuals under the\u000d\u000a        offence. The first key finding was that, although three quarters of\u000d\u000a        respondents recognised cartel practices were harmful, their attitude\u000d\u000a        towards punishment was not in step with criminalisation. Only 11%\u000d\u000a        favoured imprisonment, with most indicating public naming and shaming as\u000d\u000a        the most suitable punishment. The second key finding related to\u000d\u000a        dishonesty. 60% felt price fixing was dishonest, with only 20% strongly\u000d\u000a        feeling so. This suggests that such practices are not considered\u000d\u000a        tantamount to theft or fraud (which is the area of law where the\u000d\u000a        standard of `dishonesty' comes from).\u000d\u000a      \u000aImplications of the Dishonesty standard. Dishonesty was\u000d\u000a        included in the UK's cartel offence in order to signal the seriousness\u000d\u000a        of behaviour like price fixing and send out a strong message to the\u000d\u000a        public and to the business community. Cartels had historically been\u000d\u000a        treated with a measure of ambivalence by successive British governments.\u000d\u000a        This paper argued that this function was flawed because dishonesty\u000d\u000a        relies on a contemporary judgement by the jury, which assumes that\u000d\u000a        public attitudes are sufficiently hardened in the first place. This is\u000d\u000a        because in order for an individual to be convicted of the offence, a\u000d\u000a        prosecutor must convince the jury that what the defendant did was\u000d\u000a        dishonest `by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people'\u000d\u000a        and that he knew what he was doing was dishonesty by those standards (R\u000d\u000a        v Ghosh). Apart from the obvious danger that the jury will\u000d\u000a        simply conclude that price fixing is not objectively dishonest, the\u000d\u000a        defendant may deny his actions were dishonest by claiming he was\u000d\u000a        motivated by a desire to avoid bankruptcy and save jobs (for example).\u000d\u000a        The paper also discusses the House of Lords decision in Norris v\u000d\u000a        United States. Although this case concerned price fixing in the\u000d\u000a        context of the crime of conspiracy to defraud, it hinged on the\u000d\u000a        same issue of dishonesty. The Lords ruled that secret price fixing could\u000d\u000a        not in itself be dishonest unless it was accompanied by `aggravating\u000d\u000a        factors' such as misrepresentation, violence, fraud or inducement of a\u000d\u000a        breach of contract.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Together, these two pieces of research argue that dishonesty sets the bar\u000d\u000a      too high, making it very difficult for prosecutors to secure convictions\u000d\u000a      of individuals involved in cartel behaviour, to the detriment of\u000d\u000a      deterrence and the economy's welfare. This is reflected in the OFT's\u000d\u000a      failure to successfully prosecute a single criminal case. The only three\u000d\u000a      convictions to date resulted from a US plea bargain and extradition\u000d\u000a      arrangement.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1918","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Before our research, little interest was shown in protection for\u000d\u000a      whistleblowers. It was assumed that\u000d\u000a      protection either existed under common law or unfair dismissal provisions,\u000d\u000a      or alternatively that it\u000d\u000a      was unnecessary. Lack of empirical research prevented human resource\u000d\u000a      practitioners from\u000d\u000a      appreciating why whistleblowing procedures and policies were needed, how\u000d\u000a      such policies might\u000d\u000a      operate, and how they would relate to other arrangements. Lewis's research\u000d\u000a      has driven specific\u000d\u000a      lines of enquiry and strong policy engagement, and has had impact on\u000d\u000a      politicians, practitioners,\u000d\u000a      employers, trade unions and voluntary organisations [1]. Disseminated as\u000d\u000a      commissioned studies\u000d\u000a      [2] and derived presentations, and interrogated in numerous professional\u000d\u000a      as well as academic\u000d\u000a      forums [3], the research has highlighted public interest in encouraging\u000d\u000a      whistleblowing while\u000d\u000a      showing that such interest could not be adequately protected through\u000d\u000a      employment measures\u000d\u000a      alone.\u000d\u000a    Impact has been incremental, cumulative and goes beyond the UK. The Modern\u000d\u000a        Law Review\u000d\u000a      article (1995) stood alone as an academic study at the time of its\u000d\u000a      publication, and exerted influence\u000d\u000a      on the decision to make protection for whistleblowers an employment right\u000d\u000a      (UK). This approach\u000d\u000a      was subsequently emphasised when an increasing number of countries (and\u000d\u000a      the EU) recognised\u000d\u000a      the need for whistleblowing legislation as an anti-corruption tool.\u000d\u000a      Legislators were assisted by\u000d\u000a      access to rigorous research in the empirical evidence-base provided by\u000d\u000a      Lewis's comparative\u000d\u000a      studies of whistleblowing statutes when considering questions such as\u000d\u000a      whether\/what protection\u000d\u000a      should be given, the thresholds for evidence of wrongdoing, whether motive\u000d\u000a      was relevant, and\u000d\u000a      what remedies should be made available to those victimised for making a\u000d\u000a      disclosure.\u000d\u000a    The positive approach to whistleblowing taken by the Committee on\u000d\u000a      Standards in Public Life in the\u000d\u000a      late 1990s took account of empirical evidence presented in Lewis's\u000d\u000a      research: Public Concern at\u000d\u000a      Work deployed Lewis's results (local government study) in their\u000d\u000a      submission, and Homewood and\u000d\u000a      Lewis provided oral and written evidence in 1996 [4]. Increased acceptance\u000d\u000a      over the last decade\u000d\u000a      that effective whistleblowing arrangements are vital to private and public\u000d\u000a      interests, in the wake of\u000d\u000a      health and safety disasters and exposure of financial scandals, has\u000d\u000a      engendered processes of\u000d\u000a      reform and innovation underpinned by research. One consequence of\u000d\u000a      increased recognition of\u000d\u000a      whistleblowing procedures is the production (2008) of a publicly available\u000d\u000a      Specification Code of\u000d\u000a      Practice on Whistleblowing (BSI).\u000d\u000a    Following wider dissemination, researchers in cognate disciplines have\u000d\u000a      been demonstrably\u000d\u000a      inspired by Lewis's work (e.g. Vandekerckhove). The Unit's findings have\u000d\u000a      been incorporated by\u000d\u000a      commercial organisations in their promotion of consultancy packages on\u000d\u000a      corporate governance\u000d\u000a      and integrity (see Sai Global and Expolink). Commercial training sessions\u000d\u000a      for senior human\u000d\u000a      resource and legal practitioners run by Lexis Nexis (2009 &amp; 2012)\u000d\u000a      derive authority from expert\u000d\u000a      presentations and an outline of practice implications by Lewis; and,\u000d\u000a      extending the impact of such\u000d\u000a      research, Xpert HR (2012) commissioned the production of a comprehensive\u000d\u000a      guide to good\u000d\u000a      practice. Such channels have ensured direct and indirect impact on the\u000d\u000a      behaviour of human\u000d\u000a      resource practitioners, as well as on larger workforces. With\u000d\u000a      organisations keen to embrace best\u000d\u000a      practice, Lewis's work has made it possible for employers and employee\u000d\u000a      representatives to\u000d\u000a      develop appropriate approaches to whistleblowing arrangements [5].\u000d\u000a    Impact of the research reaches beyond the UK. In 2009 a Japanese national\u000d\u000a      committee reviewing\u000d\u000a      the impact of the Japanese Whistleblower Protection Act 2005 sought oral\u000d\u000a      evidence from Lewis\u000d\u000a      during its deliberations. In a similar context of public policy review and\u000d\u000a      formulation, Lewis was\u000d\u000a      invited to submit oral and written evidence to the Budgetary Control\u000d\u000a      Committee of the European\u000d\u000a      Parliament (2011), an opportunity he used to advocate EU-wide measures to\u000d\u000a      protect\u000d\u000a      whistleblowers via anti-discrimination directives [6]. In 2012,\u000d\u000a      Transparency International formed a\u000d\u000a      committee of experts to formulate principles for national whistleblowing\u000d\u000a      laws, with Lewis selected\u000d\u000a      as a member [7].\u000d\u000a    The Unit's research on whistleblowing continues to impact on high-level\u000d\u000a      policy debate [8] and\u000d\u000a      practical discussion regarding policies and procedures in this field in\u000d\u000a      the UK and internationally [9].\u000d\u000a      Over two decades, a specialized, previously indiscernible focus of concern\u000d\u000a      was transformed by\u000d\u000a      research led by Lewis, leading to general acknowledgement that\u000d\u000a      whistleblowing arrangements are\u000d\u000a      needed for sound business reasons. Today, employers lacking such\u000d\u000a      arrangements are recognised\u000d\u000a      as failing the interests of their organisation and staff, as well as the\u000d\u000a      interests of the public.\u000d\u000a      Deepening the contribution made to this shift of employment culture, Lewis\u000d\u000a      has been appointed as\u000d\u000a      consultant academic adviser to the National Audit Office in its review of\u000d\u000a      whistleblowing\u000d\u000a      arrangements within Government and NGOs [10] and the Comptroller &amp;\u000d\u000a      Auditor General plans to\u000d\u000a      publish the results of this work in December 2013.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Middlesex research into legislative models protecting whistleblowers has,\u000d\u000a      since its beginnings in\u000d\u000a      1993 (Lewis), made a substantial contribution to protecting this category\u000d\u000a      of persons in the UK and\u000d\u000a      abroad.

This research resulted in a seminal article on job\u000d\u000a      security for UK whistleblowers\u000d\u000a      published in Modern Law Review [1]. The following year, Public\u000d\u000a      Concern at Work commissioned\u000d\u000a      empirical research from the Unit to establish the state of play of\u000d\u000a      whistleblowing procedures in\u000d\u000a      English and Welsh local authorities. This work resonated with subsequently\u000d\u000a      conducted studies\u000d\u000a      concerned with ethical governance and corporate social responsibility,\u000d\u000a      undertaken by researchers\u000d\u000a      in the Business School (Croucher, Lyon, Frynas). The work also connected\u000d\u000a      with strands of\u000d\u000a      research in the Unit's then Centre for Legal Research (directed\u000d\u000a      successively by Subedi, Carr and\u000d\u000a      Sargeant, and involving prominent work by Lewis, Barrett and Miles). For\u000d\u000a      Lewis in particular,\u000d\u000a      whistleblowing emerged as the main research interest. His initial focus\u000d\u000a      was on the principles on\u000d\u000a      which relevant legislation has been based internationally. In this\u000d\u000a      connection he examined the\u000d\u000a      impact of statutory provisions in a number of selected countries.\u000d\u000a      Comparative studies followed -\u000d\u000a      the first of their kind to be conducted anywhere - published in Industrial\u000d\u000a        Law Journal (2001) [2] and\u000d\u000a      in Virginia Journal of International Law [3].\u000d\u000a    More recent empirical research along similar lines, funded by the\u000d\u000a      Employers Organisation for Local\u000d\u000a      Government and the Nuffield Foundation, has focused on public sector\u000d\u000a      whistleblowing procedures\u000d\u000a      [4]. More than 2.75 million people in schools, universities, local\u000d\u000a      authorities and the health service\u000d\u000a      are covered by studies conducted by the Unit. Since 2002, publications by\u000d\u000a      Lewis on these topics\u000d\u000a      have appeared in leading business ethics and employee relations' journals\u000d\u000a      [5]. In response to the\u000d\u000a      changing whistleblowing climate in the private sector, for example, Lewis\u000d\u000a      undertook two surveys of\u000d\u000a      FTSE top 250 companies funded by the British Academy (2007) and by Sai\u000d\u000a      Global (2010) [as 4\u000d\u000a      above]. In 2011, jointly with Vandekerckhove, Lewis's research resulted in\u000d\u000a      a critical review of\u000d\u000a      international official guidelines on the content of whistleblowing\u000d\u000a      procedures [6].\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research has sought to identify: a) the principles on\u000d\u000a      which whistleblowing\u000d\u000a      statutes have been based in different countries, as a basis for\u000d\u000a      recommending priorities in future\u000d\u000a      legislation; and b) the key features of whistleblowing policies and\u000d\u000a      practice, as a basis for defining\u000d\u000a      good practice. In a wide range of publications associated with related\u000d\u000a      threads of employment law\u000d\u000a      research in the Unit (Barrett, Sargeant, Miles), Lewis has completed\u000d\u000a      comparative studies of\u000d\u000a      whistleblowing statutes in South Africa and Norway (with Uys 2007 and\u000d\u000a      Trygstad, 2009); he has\u000d\u000a      provided a comprehensive analysis of the effect of UK legislation in its\u000d\u000a      first ten years of operation\u000d\u000a      (2008); and he has argued in Industrial Law Journal articles that\u000d\u000a      the EU anti-discrimination\u000d\u000a      Directives should be applied to whistleblowing (2005) in addition to being\u000d\u000a      promoted as an\u000d\u000a      important tool in the fight against corruption (with Carr, 2010).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1919","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1218197","Name":"Turkmenistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1512440","Name":"Uzbekistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"290291","Name":"Bahrain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2275384","Name":"Liberia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1522867","Name":"Kazakhstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact from the body of research described above falls into two streams:\u000d\u000a      (1) contribution to international policy formulation; and (2) research-led\u000d\u000a      training of actors whose practice has been made more effective by\u000d\u000a      engagement with collective rights.\u000d\u000a    1. Formulation of a new UN SDG, `Gender, Social Inclusion and Human\u000d\u000a        Rights' Castellino's (and his colleagues') critique of dominant\u000d\u000a      approaches to rights, and proposals for alternative formulations around\u000d\u000a      group rights derived from non-Western legal systems, led to his\u000d\u000a      appointment as Co-chair of the Social Exclusion, Human Rights and Gender\u000d\u000a      group, as indicated above. This position called for his input into\u000d\u000a      formulation of the SDGs [1] with input into the High Level Panel [2]\u000d\u000a      reflected in the report of the UN Secretary-General [3]. Inclusion of a\u000d\u000a      human rights goal based on vulnerable groups, as advocated by Castellino,\u000d\u000a      contributes to the establishment of a global framework for poverty\u000d\u000a      eradication, hitherto an exclusive concern of development economists.\u000d\u000a    The SDG formulated is informed by research produced by the Unit and by\u000d\u000a      Castellino's public advocacy as lead researcher to NGOs and end-users [4]\u000d\u000a      as well as Governments [5]. The model avoids traditional rights foci on\u000d\u000a      the individual and emphasizes co-operation rather than censure. Each of\u000d\u000a      these aspects involves a significant departure from the orthodoxies of\u000d\u000a      contemporary human rights politics; underpinned by publications that had\u000d\u000a      led to Castellino's appointment as Co- chair of the UN Group in the first\u000d\u000a      place, and which guided his co-chairing of that Group, and impacted the\u000d\u000a      deliberations of the High Level Panel chaired by Their Excellencies\u000d\u000a      Cameron (UK), Johnson Sirleaf (Liberia) and Yudhoyono (Indonesia).\u000d\u000a    Research in the Unit is now engaged in analysis of the unfolding impact\u000d\u000a      of the SDGs e.g. in relation to criticism from human rights lobbies wedded\u000d\u000a      to censure, (`naming and shaming' procedures, see Dominguez-Redondo,\u000d\u000a      Output 3). Compliance with the SDGs will follow the practice associated\u000d\u000a      with the earlier Millennium Development Goals, i.e. annual world-wide\u000d\u000a      monitoring. The ultimate impact of the Unit's research, accordingly, as\u000d\u000a      amplified by the goal it has helped to shape through publications and\u000d\u000a      Castellino's UN involvement, will be the requirement on 194 states to\u000d\u000a      provide evidence of progress to the UN over the 15 year span of the SDGs.\u000d\u000a      Potential impact is therefore on millions, to the extent that national\u000d\u000a      policies adhere to the SDGs, and UN goals are reflected by agencies whose\u000d\u000a      activities and funding will be shaped to implement them.\u000d\u000a    2. Training programmes aimed at capacity-building related to\u000d\u000a        group-oriented human rights To connect the Unit's contribution to\u000d\u000a      policy formation with professional practice, a range of programmes have\u000d\u000a      been designed and delivered by researchers to advocates (a), judges (b),\u000d\u000a      civil servants (c) and emerging policy makers (d),as below:\u000d\u000a    a. 2009. The Human Rights Defenders Network (Central Asia)\u000d\u000a      created by the European Human Rights Advocacy Centre and other researchers\u000d\u000a      in this Unit, and funded by the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office.\u000d\u000a      The Network consists of 18 professionals from Kyrgyzstan,\u000d\u000a      Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, but also extends to Tajiks and Turkmen and is\u000d\u000a      hosted by the Kazakh Human Rights Lawyers Association, Almaty.\u000d\u000a      Continued academic support provided by Middlesex researchers consists of\u000d\u000a      updates training and facilitation of networking between international\u000d\u000a      organizations [6].\u000d\u000a    b. 2010. Two-day judicial colloquium, Equality Law: Global\u000d\u000a        Approaches, co-hosted with Equal Rights Trust (UK) and Human Rights\u000d\u000a      Law Network (HRLN, India). This event was attended by Lord Walker, then\u000d\u000a      President, UK Supreme Court; Lord Lester QC, and Lord Justice Sedley (via\u000d\u000a      video-link) [7]. The case analyses presented were drawn from Middlesex\u000d\u000a      research, adapted to requirements of the Supreme Court of India. Impact\u000d\u000a      took the form of increased professional awareness and enhanced expertise\u000d\u000a      on the part of 40 High Court and Supreme Court judges. The programme also\u000d\u000a      led to a successful bid by HRLN (India), funded by KIOS (Finland), to\u000d\u000a      deliver training in conjunction with Middlesex staff to the judiciaries of\u000d\u000a      Bangladesh (October 2013) and Nepal (April 2014) [8].\u000d\u000a    c. 2011. Human rights programme designed to assist the re-building\u000d\u000a      of Iraqi Kurdistan, delivered by Dominguez-Redondo and others (funded by\u000d\u000a      British Council, facilitated by DelPhE). This programme was delivered to\u000d\u000a      20 civil servants and judges, and became the model on which the first LLM\u000d\u000a      Human Rights Law in Iraq was directly based (Duhok University, first award\u000d\u000a      made in 2012 to 20 recipients) [9].\u000d\u000a    d. 2012. Closed sessions at Wilton House, Sussex, delivered by\u000d\u000a      Castellino, on human rights considerations involved in drafting new\u000d\u000a      constitutions. These sessions derived from Castellino's research in\u000d\u000a      comparative constitutional law, and functioned as catalysts to continuing\u000d\u000a      work on drafting by nine Arab delegations. The delegations consisted of\u000d\u000a      MPs, leaders of opposition parties, activists and journalists, selected by\u000d\u000a      the British Council based in Bahrain. The event was devised in response to\u000d\u000a      an approach by Shevolution on behalf of the British Council and Foreign\u000d\u000a      &amp; Commonwealth Office [10].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Emerging from investigations of social exclusion during the 1990s, the\u000d\u000a      Unit's research into minority rights has led to outputs and consultancy\u000d\u000a      ranging across political participation, identity, rights protection and\u000d\u000a      international criminal law. The impact claimed here falls in two main\u000d\u000a      channels. Firstly, research on socio-economic group rights, amplified by\u000d\u000a      Castellino's work as co-chair of the relevant UN delegated group, has made\u000d\u000a      a significant input into the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\u000d\u000a      2015-30.

With access to law restricted, the approach\u000d\u000a      has led to increased inequality. Research in the Unit has collected\u000d\u000a      evidence and sustained arguments for strengthening socio-economic rights -\u000d\u000a      hitherto deemed non- justiciable - and making them collectively available\u000d\u000a      to vulnerable groups. Studies concerned with these issues have been\u000d\u000a      conducted by the Unit in domestic jurisdictions in different continents.\u000d\u000a    The present emphasis of this research emerged in a series of steps from\u000d\u000a      work on social exclusion at Middlesex during the 1990s. That work\u000d\u000a      consisted initially of Sargeant's analysis of the mis- articulation of\u000d\u000a      public policy that led to workplace exclusions [1]. From 2007, Castellino\u000d\u000a      introduced a focus on socio-economic underpinnings of exclusion,\u000d\u000a      highlighting remedies in administrative systems in different states. Other\u000d\u000a      contributors to concern with exclusion included Howard (religious\u000d\u000a      identity); Wray (immigration); Dominguez-Redondo &amp; Keane (minority\u000d\u000a      rights); Schabas (genocide, international criminal law); and Leach\u000d\u000a      (litigation).\u000d\u000a    The resulting body of research takes a distinctive comparative approach\u000d\u000a      to the critique of vulnerable groups' access to law. Special emphasis is\u000d\u000a      placed on `Southern law', challenging legal systems that derived from the\u000d\u000a      colonial experience. Publications have examined constitutional,\u000d\u000a      administrative and legislative measures in jurisdictions that have tackled\u000d\u000a      problems of exclusion in land ownership, freedom of religion, political\u000d\u000a      participation, gender, immigration and education. Together, the Unit's\u000d\u000a      studies propose models that could be incorporated into legal systems as\u000d\u000a      solutions, while demonstrating how courts remain beyond the reach of\u000d\u000a      vulnerable groups.\u000d\u000a    The Unit's research is closely linked to advocacy. The researchers work\u000d\u000a      to mainstream rights in administrative legal policy, to bring together\u000d\u000a      investigation of collective dimensions of rights with remedies and with\u000d\u000a      capacity-building among lawyers and activists. Along with associated\u000d\u000a      professional activity derived from the research, the studies described\u000d\u000a      have played a significant part in facilitating the Unit's links with\u000d\u000a      legislators, bar associations, and NGOs.\u000d\u000a    Notable in the broader impact of the Unit's research, a specific impact\u000d\u000a      on UN policy stems from research initially published in a special issue of\u000d\u000a      the International Journal of Human Rights entitled `Millennium\u000d\u000a      Development Goals and Human Rights' [2]. That issue, edited by Doyle,\u000d\u000a      contained contributions from Castellino and Dominguez-Redondo [3] which\u000d\u000a      argued for broadening the scope of goal-setting towards collective rights.\u000d\u000a      The perspective put forward in those articles has since been elaborated in\u000d\u000a      an assessment of constitutional models developed in successive volumes of\u000d\u000a      the Oxford University Press (OUP) Minority Rights Series, co-written by\u000d\u000a      Castellino (lead author) with Dominguez Redondo (Asia) and with Keane\u000d\u000a      (Pacific) [4]. The third volume in this series (co- written with\u000d\u000a      Cavanaugh, 2013) examines the Middle East [5]. On the strength of the\u000d\u000a      collective work of this group of researchers, Castellino was invited to\u000d\u000a      join the Leadership Council of the United Nations Sustainable Development\u000d\u000a      Solutions Network (UNSDSN), and now co-chairs the group `Social Exclusion,\u000d\u000a      Human Rights and Gender'. Castellino's contribution in this role has led\u000d\u000a      to incorporation of collective human rights as a projected goal, and his\u000d\u000a      wording is reflected in the UN Secretary General's Report, September 2013\u000d\u000a      [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1978","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Principles and the Draft Common\u000a      Frame of Reference are considered essential reference points in the field\u000a      of European Private Law.\u000a      They have informed debate and discussion among practitioners and\u000a      policy-makers, changed the\u000a      way in which the subject is taught, and influenced the development of\u000a      legislation and legal principle\u000a      across a range of jurisdictions both within Europe and further afield.\u000a    Impact as a statement of legal principle: As one scholar has\u000a      noted, The Principles `have been\u000a      assigned substantial informal authority. Many actors in the legal field\u000a      treat these Principles as\u000a      reference texts, on which they can base legal decisions without further\u000a      argument.' (5a). For\u000a      example, the European Court of Justice (now the CJEU) has held that legal\u000a      terms used in EU\u000a      legislation are to be given an `autonomous European legal meaning'. When\u000a      the legislation does not\u000a      provide its own definition, The Principles and\/or the DCFR have\u000a      been relied upon by the\u000a      Advocates-General in the ECJ for interpretive purposes (5b). Similarly,\u000a      Law Commission papers on\u000a      contract issues regularly take account of The Principles or the\u000a      DCFR: the 2011 consultation paper\u000a      on Consumer Redress for Misleading and Aggressive Practices\u000a      devoted several pages to the\u000a      DCFR (5c). The Law Commission has also stated that Directives should be\u000a      interpreted in the light\u000a      of the DCFR: in the 2008 Consultation Paper on Consumer Remedies for\u000a        Faulty Goods, for\u000a      example, it was noted that the relevant Directive `does not specifically\u000a      define sales contracts, but\u000a      we think that it must be interpreted in the light of the Draft Common\u000a      Frame of Reference' (5d). Key\u000a      individuals have also referred to The Principles and the DCFR as\u000a      important reference points (5l\u000a      and m), with the President of the European Law Institute noting that it is\u000a      `hard to emphasise\u000a      sufficiently the influence that the PECL and the DCFR have had ...in this\u000a      developing field of\u000a      European Union law, through their use by both the European legislators and\u000a      the courts at all levels\u000a      when interpreting European law' (5m).\u000a    Impact on the development of legal principle: The influence of The\u000a        Principles and the DCFR is\u000a      evident in the way that they are referred to by the courts in this\u000a      jurisdiction. In Yam Seng Pte\u000a        Limited v International Trade Corporation Limited [2013] EWHC 111\u000a      (QB), para 124 (5e), it was\u000a      noted that they embodied a general duty to act in accordance with good\u000a      faith and fair dealing, with\u000a      the judge noting that `[t]here can be little doubt that the penetration of\u000a      this principle into English law\u000a      and the pressures towards a more unified European law of contract in which\u000a      the principle plays a\u000a      significant role will continue to increase.' Even where the courts decline\u000a      to adopt the approach\u000a      proposed, The Principles are still seen as a key reference point\u000a      from which any departure needs to\u000a      be justified (see e.g. Chartbrook Ltd v Persimmon Homes Ltd [2009]\u000a      UKHL 38, para 39 (5e)).\u000a    Impact on government policy and legislative change: The\u000a        Principles have been particularly\u000a      influential in the newer democracies in Central Europe and some of the\u000a      Baltic States, many of\u000a      which have revised or are in the process of revising their laws of\u000a      contract or their civil codes (see\u000a      5f). In Hungary, drafters of the new Civil Code were expressly directed to\u000a      take into consideration\u000a      the solutions offered by The Principles (Kisfaludi, 5f), while in\u000a      Poland, `a number of new rules\u000a      introduced to the Civil Code have been inspired by solutions adopted in\u000a      European (PECL) and\u000a      UNIDROIT (UPICC) principles of contract law.' (Rajski, 5f). Estonia now\u000a      has a modern law of\u000a      contract that draws on The Principles as a major source of its\u000a      provisions, with changes being made\u000a      to both the law of obligations and the Civil Code (Kull, 5f). Within\u000a      Western Europe, the French\u000a      Ministry of Justice is considering new articles for the Civil Code drawn\u000a      directly from the Principles\u000a      (2008 to the present: see 5g).\u000a    Impact on developing a European Contract Law: At a conceptual\u000a      level, The Principles have had\u000a      an impact in developing the idea of European Contract Law. Previously most\u000a      contract teaching was\u000a      on the basis of national law or of comparison between national systems.\u000a      There are now many\u000a      courses across Europe on European Contract Law, using The Principles\u000a      as a primary source (see\u000a      e.g. 5h) or using a casebook in which they form a key element and which is\u000a      distributed across the\u000a      continent (5i). In the UK The Principles are reproduced in\u000a      standard student collections of statutory\u000a      material. The President of the European Law Institute has noted how The\u000a        Principles and the DCFR\u000a      provided a model on which the Legal Affairs Committee of the European\u000a      Parliament relied heavily\u000a      when dealing with the `European Contract Law Project' (5m).\u000a    At a practical level, both The Principles and the DCFR have also\u000a      had substantial impact in\u000a      informing the development of new rules. One particular problem for\u000a      businesses operating across\u000a      the EU has been the lack of common rules. In a cross-border contract,\u000a      because any contract has\u000a      to be governed by a national legal system, at least one of the parties\u000a      must contract under a law\u000a      that is foreign to it and which often will be in a foreign language. For\u000a      businesses trying to sell\u000a      across borders to consumers, there is an additional problem. In order to\u000a      prevent consumers losing\u000a      their rights by businesses choosing governing laws that have little or no\u000a      protection for consumers,\u000a      the Rome I Regulation provides that where a business has directed its\u000a      activities towards\u000a      consumers in another country (by mailshots or via a website that appears\u000a      to invite orders from that\u000a      country), a consumer who is habitually resident there and who contracts\u000a      with the business is\u000a      entitled to the protection of the mandatory rules of the targeted country.\u000a      This means that a\u000a      business seeking to sell to consumers Europe-wide has to deal with 28\u000a      different legal systems.\u000a      These rules discourage businesses, especially small and medium\u000a      enterprises, from selling across\u000a      borders. Even for business-to-business sales, differences between systems\u000a      remain a major\u000a      problem. The UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (1980; the\u000a      UK has not adopted\u000a      the Convention) applies to sales between businesses (it does not apply to\u000a      consumer sales) but it\u000a      omits many of the protections that Small and Medium Enterprises need. To\u000a      address this problem,\u000a      and to make it easier and more attractive to businesses to market their\u000a      goods and services across\u000a      borders, develop further the internal market and provide buyers with\u000a      increased choice and, with\u000a      more competition, lower prices, the European Commission has drawn up a\u000a      proposed Regulation\u000a      for a Common Sales Law. Both The Principles and the DCFR have been\u000a      a major inspiration and\u000a      source of material for this (see e.g. 5l, describing them as `the backbone\u000a      of the proposal for the\u000a      Common European Sales Law'), with the `Feasibility Study' produced by the\u000a      EC's Expert Group,\u000a      and the proposed Common Sales Law itself, drawing heavily on Books I-III\u000a      and IVA of the DCFR\u000a      and also on The Principles, which provided the basic rules for\u000a      contracts (see 5j). As at 31 July\u000a      2013, the proposed Regulation is the subject of negotiations between the\u000a      Commission, the Council\u000a      of Ministers and the European Parliament. Beale continues to play a direct\u000a      and influential role in\u000a      the progress of these negotiations, having presented drafts of the DCFR\u000a      and now the Regulation at\u000a      stakeholder workshops organised by the European Commission and having\u000a      given evidence to the\u000a      Legal Affairs Committee of the Parliament. Drawing on his research over\u000a      the last two decades, he\u000a      is currently writing a Commentary on the text for the Commission, for\u000a      officials to use during\u000a      negotiations and for ultimate publication.\u000a    Impact on policy debate outside Europe: The Principles\u000a      have also had an impact by informing\u000a      the policy discussions outside Europe. They have been discussed by\u000a      practitioners and academics\u000a      in Chile (`Modernization of the Law of Obligations in Europe and Latin\u000a        America', Valparaiso, Chile,\u000a      September 2008) and by a Commission on Asian Contract Law (see 5k).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Beale was a major contributor to research published in 2000 as The\u000a        Principles of European Contract Law (The Principles). The\u000a        Principles had and continue to have a\u000a      major impact on the development of contract law at both the EU and\u000a      national levels. They formed\u000a      the basis of subsequent work that led to the Draft Common Frame of\u000a      Reference (DCFR, 2009),\u000a      which incorporated The Principles. The Principles and the\u000a      DCFR have influenced interpretation in\u000a      the European Court of Justice (ECJ) \/ Court of Justice of the European\u000a      Union (CJEU) and are cited\u000a      in national courts.

Some harmonisation has been brought about by EU Directives,\u000a      particularly of consumer\u000a      law, but major differences of both form and substance remain between the\u000a      general laws of\u000a      contract. Terminology and concepts vary widely and are not always\u000a      understood by lawyers from\u000a      other jurisdictions. In some cases, the laws produce very different\u000a      results. This makes it hard to\u000a      draft and to interpret both supposedly harmonising measures and actual\u000a      contracts, and so adds to\u000a      the cost of cross-border trade in the Internal Market. The project of\u000a      harmonising contract law\u000a      across the EU is thus of profound significance in both conceptual and\u000a      practical terms, and Beale's\u000a      comparative research into contract law has played a major role at key\u000a      stages of this project.\u000a    From 1987 until 2000, Beale was, in addition to holding a chair at\u000a      Warwick, a leading member of\u000a      the Commission on European Contract Law, the research group\u000a      composed of professors from\u000a      the Member States that had been established by Professor Ole Lando to\u000a      examine the possibility of\u000a      achieving such harmonisation. In this role he was engaged in researching,\u000a      drafting and editing the\u000a      Commission's major output, The Principles of European Contract Law,\u000a        Parts I and II (2000: 3a).\u000a    The Principles employed a `functional' comparative law\u000a      approach that looked at practical\u000a      outcomes to demonstrate that in reality the laws of the various EU Member\u000a      States had much in\u000a      common, and, insofar as national outcomes or rules found in international\u000a      conventions differed,\u000a      that it would be possible to develop a workable `European' contract law\u000a      that would be broadly\u000a      acceptable to lawyers from the various Member States. The research\u000a      involved close comparative\u000a      study and intensive discussion to find the most appropriate formulations\u000a      and solutions. Beale was\u000a      one of five scholars who carried out the initial comparative research and\u000a      drafted the articles and\u000a      accompanying Comments.\u000a    Once the texts had been approved by the Commission, Beale, with Lando,\u000a      synthesised the\u000a      comparative material into detailed `Notes' and revised the Comments. With\u000a      Parts I and II having\u000a      been published in 2000, Beale was also a member of the drafting group for\u000a      Part III until 2000, with\u000a      Professors Clive (Edinburgh, from 2000), Goode (then at QMU), Wilson\u000a      (Edinburgh, until 1992)\u000a      and MacQueen (Edinburgh, from 1996) also being members of one or more of\u000a      the groups.\u000a    The Principles formed the basis of subsequent work in this area.\u000a      From 2000 to 2007 Beale, by\u000a      then a Law Commissioner on temporary secondment from Warwick, was a\u000a      leading member of the\u000a      Study Group on a European Civil Code, which, adopting a similar\u000a      research methodology and\u000a      format to the Commission, produced a series of restatements that, where\u000a      relevant, built on or\u000a      referred to The Principles (3b). Meanwhile the European\u000a      Commission's Action Plan on European\u000a        Contract Law proposed a Common Frame of Reference to assist in the\u000a      drafting or revision of EU\u000a      legislation on contract law, and to form the basis for developing an\u000a      `Optional Instrument', a single\u000a      European system which could be used across the EU in particular for\u000a      cross-border transactions.\u000a      The Study Group and the `Acquis' Group (working on underlying principles\u000a      in existing EU Law)\u000a      were commissioned to produce the Draft Common Frame of Reference\u000a      (DCFR: 3c).\u000a    To achieve this, within the Study Group draft articles, comments and\u000a      notes were produced by\u000a      teams working under experienced academics, with advice from Specialist\u000a      Advisors and a drafting\u000a      committee; texts were approved by a Co-ordinating Committee. Beale was a\u000a      leading member of\u000a      both committees, and as such engaged in continuing research into\u000a      comparative contract law. He\u000a      also advised several of its teams and was a member of the small team\u000a      (drawn from the Study\u000a      Group on a European Civil Code and the Acquis Group) responsible for\u000a      drafting the text of the\u000a      DCFR, which incorporated The Principles (sometimes adjusted so as\u000a      to cover all kinds of\u000a      obligation). He played a leading role in presenting drafts of the DCFR\u000a      (and later the Common\u000a      European Sales Law) at stakeholder workshops organised by the European\u000a      Commission. The\u000a      DCFR was submitted to the European Commission at the end of 2007.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1979","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3355338","Name":"Namibia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Faundez's research has had an impact on the development of legislation,\u000d\u000a      on policy-makers' understanding of legal reform and the implementation of\u000d\u000a      policy, and on the work of NGOs.\u000d\u000a    Impact on the development of legislation: The publication of Affirmative Action (3d) led to Faundez being invited by the ILO to assist the\u000d\u000a      Governments of Namibia and South Africa in drafting their affirmative\u000d\u000a      action legislation in employment. The legislation was enacted in each\u000d\u000a      country in 1998. It was the first affirmative action law enacted in a\u000d\u000a      developing country that was consistent with the principles of\u000d\u000a      international law, and continues to have an impact on the rights of\u000d\u000a      individuals in those countries today (5c). This is reflected in the\u000d\u000a      positive evaluation of affirmative action by the US State Department in\u000d\u000a      its 2012 report (5g): it noted that `Namibia's Affirmative Action Act\u000d\u000a      strives to create equal employment opportunities, improve conditions for\u000d\u000a      the historically disadvantaged, and eliminate discrimination. The\u000d\u000a      commission facilitates training programs, provides technical and other\u000d\u000a      assistance, and offers expert advice, information, and guidance on\u000d\u000a      implementing affirmative action in the work place.' It also noted how\u000d\u000a      practical steps had been taken in different industries to embed\u000d\u000a      affirmative action and increase Namibian participation, with companies in\u000d\u000a      the fishing sector paying lower quota fees `if they operate\u000d\u000a      Namibian-flagged vessels that are based in Namibia, with crews that are\u000d\u000a      predominantly Namibian' and that the Minister of Mining and Energy `has\u000d\u000a      made clear that prospective mining companies must \"indicate and show\u000d\u000a      commitment to empower previously disadvantaged Namibians\" in their\u000d\u000a      applications for exploration and mining licenses.\"' One empirical study\u000d\u000a      (5h) has noted that the affirmative impact legislation has had a positive\u000d\u000a      impact in both South Africa and Namibia, with enhanced representation of\u000d\u000a      people from designated groups in positions of responsibility, although\u000d\u000a      progress has been slower for women and people with disabilities.\u000d\u000a    Impact on policy-makers' understanding of legal reform: Faundez's\u000d\u000a      research on access to justice and on empowerment and democracy (see 3e-i)\u000d\u000a      has been influential in shaping the policy of inter-governmental\u000d\u000a      organisations, such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development\u000d\u000a      Bank, and of bilateral donor agencies, such as DFID. It has contributed to\u000d\u000a      shifting the focus of legal reform projects from an almost exclusive focus\u000d\u000a      on an ideal-type vision of state institutions towards the wider\u000d\u000a      institutional approach that takes into account the plight of vulnerable\u000d\u000a      groups (5b).\u000d\u000a    On the basis of his work on democracy and legal empowerment (see e.g.\u000d\u000a      3h), in 2007 the ILO invited Faundez to carry out a study on whether\u000d\u000a      international labour standards, as embodied in relevant treaties and\u000d\u000a      recommendations, benefit workers in small and micro-enterprises, most of\u000d\u000a      which are in the informal sector. The ILO published his resulting report\u000d\u000a      in 2008: A View on International Labour Standards, Labour Law and MSEs\u000d\u000a      (ILO: Geneva, Employment Working Paper No. 18). This has provided valuable\u000d\u000a      research evidence to inform policy debates in this area. It also achieved\u000d\u000a      a wide readership by being available to download from the ILO's website,\u000d\u000a      thus contributing to improved understanding of this area (5c).\u000d\u000a    His work on non-state justice was cited in the Organisation for Economic\u000d\u000a      Co-operation and Development's 2008 paper, Enhancing the Delivery of\u000d\u000a        Justice and Security. Building on his body of work in the area of\u000d\u000a      non-state justice and security systems, in 2009 he (together with Alison\u000d\u000a      Lochhead and Lt. Col. Hugh Evans) was then requested by DFID to prepare a\u000d\u000a      report on these issues. The resulting report, Lessons Learned From\u000d\u000a        Selected DFID Justice and Security Programmes&#8212;Study to Inform the White\u000d\u000a        Paper Process (2009) advised that `DFID should reaffirm its\u000d\u000a      comprehensive and pro-poor approach to justice and security, but should\u000d\u000a      ensure that its programmes are firmly linked to sustainable development\u000d\u000a      outcomes'. This Report was used as one of the background papers for the\u000d\u000a      DFID's White Paper Eliminating World Poverty: Building our Common\u000d\u000a        Future (2009). This White Paper drew specifically on the insight\u000d\u000a      that security and justice projects should not lose sight of the close link\u000d\u000a      existing between security, justice and sustainable economic growth (5f).\u000d\u000a    In 2010 Faundez was invited by the World Bank to participate in its Legal\u000d\u000a      Pluralism and Development Policy workshop. This workshop led to the\u000d\u000a      publication of an edited collection, published by Cambridge University\u000d\u000a      Press in 2012, entitled Legal Pluralism and Development Scholars and\u000d\u000a        Practitioners in Dialogue. This collection (see 3g), is the first\u000d\u000a      World Bank-sponsored publication to include articles by leading\u000d\u000a      international scholars and development practitioners with expertise in\u000d\u000a      legal pluralism, reflecting an important development in the provision of\u000d\u000a      research evidence to policy-makers (see 5b).\u000d\u000a    Following this publication, in 2012 the World Bank invited Faundez to be\u000d\u000a      part of a group of experts to address issues relating to the\u000d\u000a      justice-security-development nexus with special reference to fragile and\u000d\u000a      conflict-affected countries. The aim of the project is to provide\u000d\u000a      practical guidance on how the World Bank might promote legitimate and\u000d\u000a      effective institutions to manage injustice and insecurity in fragile\u000d\u000a      states. At the expert group meeting, held in November 2012, Faundez was\u000d\u000a      invited to comment on the practical problems arising from the efforts to\u000d\u000a      link justice with security and development concerns (5e). His comments,\u000d\u000a      together with those of other participating experts, led to a revision of\u000d\u000a      the World Bank's discussion paper on this topic (The\u000d\u000a        Justice-Security-Development Nexus: Theory and Practice in Fragile and\u000d\u000a        Conflict-Affected States). This discussion paper was published in\u000d\u000a      2013 by The Hague Journal on the Rule of Law (5(2)), a journal of\u000d\u000a      which Faundez is co-editor-in-chief, again reflecting his role in\u000d\u000a      promoting dialogue between practitioners and academia.\u000d\u000a    Faundez's 2003 Report for the DFID on non-state justice in Latin America\u000d\u000a      has also contributed to improve public understanding of the issues, having\u000d\u000a      been widely disseminated among development practitioners. This Report is\u000d\u000a      also cited in the DFID's influential Briefing Note on Non-State\u000d\u000a        Justice and Security Systems (DFID 2004), which continues to be a\u000d\u000a      key reference point in this field (5a).\u000d\u000a    Impact on the evaluation of legal reform projects: Faundez's\u000d\u000a      research into the design and scope of legal reform projects has also\u000d\u000a      provided evidence to inform practice and the implementation of policy (see\u000d\u000a      5b). One example of a project benefiting from Faundez's expertise is the\u000d\u000a      Capacity Building of the Sudan Judiciary Project, funded by a Multi-Donor\u000d\u000a      Trust Fund administered by the World Bank. The aim of the project was to\u000d\u000a      strengthen judicial independence so as to enable the judiciary to\u000d\u000a      effectively and fairly apply the law. Faundez was invited by the World\u000d\u000a      Bank to carry out a Mid-Term Review on the implementation of the project.\u000d\u000a      Drawing on his experience evaluating justice reform projects for the World\u000d\u000a      Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (see in particular 3c and f),\u000d\u000a      his report, Capacity Building of the Sudan Judiciary (Sudan Multi\u000d\u000a        Donor Trust Fund) Mid-Term Review (2008), highlighted the problems\u000d\u000a      inherent in the design of justice reform projects in contexts where the\u000d\u000a      institutional environment is fragile and external intervention on matters\u000d\u000a      concerning the judiciary are regarded as sensitive because of the\u000d\u000a      authoritarian nature of the regime and the close link between legal and\u000d\u000a      religious principles. Faundez also noted that the project had greatly\u000d\u000a      underestimated the difficulties involved in delivering training programmes\u000d\u000a      aimed at improving the capacity of officials working in the justice\u000d\u000a      system. The project was adjusted accordingly and training has formed an\u000d\u000a      important part of Phase II of the project (5i).\u000d\u000a    Impact on non-governmental organisations: Faundez's research on\u000d\u000a      community justice and legal pluralism has also influenced the work of\u000d\u000a      NGOs. Drawing on his research (in particular 3e, f and h), he helped\u000d\u000a      Amnesty International understand the complex legal issues relating to\u000d\u000a      indigenous peoples in Latin America. In particular, his research helped\u000d\u000a      Amnesty to clarify aspects of Bolivia's legislation relating to the\u000d\u000a      relationship between state judicial systems and dispute resolution\u000d\u000a      mechanisms employed by indigenous peoples in rural areas (Ley de\u000d\u000a        Deslinde Jurisdiccional). As a consequence, in 2010 Amnesty issued\u000d\u000a      an open letter to the Plurinational Legislative Assembly of Bolivia, which\u000d\u000a      identifies the issues that legislators should take into account when\u000d\u000a      defining the jurisdiction of various parallel systems of justice (5d).\u000d\u000a    Since 2009, Faundez has been actively involved in the activities of the\u000d\u000a      World Justice Project, an NGO based in Washington that publishes the\u000d\u000a      prestigious Rule of Law Index and constitutes a multinational and\u000d\u000a      multidisciplinary initiative to strengthen the Rule of Law worldwide. He\u000d\u000a      participated in their major research project on access to justice, which\u000d\u000a      culminated in the publication of two edited collections (Global\u000d\u000a        Perspectives on the Rule of Law and Marginalised Communities and\u000d\u000a        Access to Justice) in the series Law, Development and\u000d\u000a        Globalization, of which he is the sole editor (see 5k). Faundez also\u000d\u000a      supported the World Justice Project in a study on the use of indicators\u000d\u000a      for measuring the impact of rule of law and governance. The findings of\u000d\u000a      this study were published as a special issue of The Hague Journal on\u000d\u000a        the Rule of Law in 2011 (see 3g and 5k). His impact on this\u000d\u000a      organisation was reflected in their invitation to him to serve as a\u000d\u000a      Moderator for their Rule of Law Keynote Panel at the 2010 Latin America\u000d\u000a      and Caribbean Rule of Law Conference: expressing their admiration for\u000d\u000a      Faundez's long-standing multidisciplinary commitment to upholding the Rule\u000d\u000a      of Law, they acknowledged his role as `an inspirational leader' and his\u000d\u000a      undertaking of `a diverse array of noble and noteworthy causes, all of\u000d\u000a      which have helped to promote effective Rule of Law for the development of\u000d\u000a      communities of opportunity and equity' (5j).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Faundez's research has set out how legal reform projects should\u000d\u000a      be designed and implemented in order to be successful in the context of\u000d\u000a      existing local conditions and to ensure access to justice for indigenous\u000d\u000a      peoples and other vulnerable groups. His work as policy advisor both to\u000d\u000a      development agencies (the World Bank, the UK's Department for\u000d\u000a      International Development (DFID), and the Inter-American Development Bank)\u000d\u000a      and to Non- Governmental Organisations (NGOs) (Amnesty International, the\u000d\u000a      World Justice Project) has helped these organisations broaden their\u000d\u000a      approach to the design, implementation and evaluation of legal reform\u000d\u000a      projects.

Throughout this period, he has held a full-time\u000d\u000a      appointment as Professor of Law at the University of Warwick. His work on\u000d\u000a      access to justice relies on his expertise and practical knowledge of\u000d\u000a      governance and legal reform issues in Latin America (Chile, Per&#250; and\u000d\u000a      Colombia) and Southern Africa (Namibia and South Africa). In particular,\u000d\u000a      his research on governance and legal reform is informed by two main\u000d\u000a      insights relating to (1) the conception, scope and design of legal reform\u000d\u000a      projects; and (2) the capacity of state law to reach vulnerable people\u000d\u000a      living in areas where the presence of the state is limited.\u000d\u000a    On the first issue (1) his research shows that these projects, as\u000d\u000a      originally conceived, had serious shortcomings because they were based\u000d\u000a      upon the mistaken assumption that law is a purely technical artefact that\u000d\u000a      can be easily transplanted without taking into account local conditions.\u000d\u000a      Accordingly, his research argues that in order to succeed, legal reform\u000d\u000a      projects should focus on developing societies as a whole, rather than on\u000d\u000a      an ideal type of legal model based on developed Western democracies (see\u000d\u000a      3a, b, c and g).\u000d\u000a    On the capacity of state law to reach vulnerable people living in areas\u000d\u000a      where the presence of the state is limited, his research demonstrates that\u000d\u000a      the objective of achieving market-friendly legal systems cannot be\u000d\u000a      realised without taking into account the social and economic circumstances\u000d\u000a      of vulnerable groups, who, in developing countries, are largely outside\u000d\u000a      the formal economy and with no political or legal rights. Accordingly, a\u000d\u000a      key strand of his research is to examine in detail whether and, if so, how\u000d\u000a      law operates in areas where state institutions are either weak or absent.\u000d\u000a      This aspect of his research focuses on the plight of indigenous peoples\u000d\u000a      and other vulnerable groups such as workers in the informal economy. His\u000d\u000a      research draws on domestic law and international Law (as reflected in\u000d\u000a      International Labour Conventions) and human right standards, as\u000d\u000a      interpreted by international courts, in particular the Inter-American\u000d\u000a      Court of Human Rights (see 3e, f and g).\u000d\u000a    A distinctive feature of Faundez's work has been his continuous effort to\u000d\u000a      promote a dialogue between development practitioners and academics. His\u000d\u000a      1994 book, Affirmative Action&#8212; International Perspectives, was\u000d\u000a      published by the International Labour Organisation (3d) and Good\u000d\u000a        Government and Law (3a) was the main output of a conference that had\u000d\u000a      been funded by the British Council with the specific aim of building links\u000d\u000a      between academics and practitioners.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1980","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2134431","Name":"Vanuatu"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research has had an extensive impact on the development of\u000d\u000a      methodologies in HRIAs and EHRIAs and on policy debate at international,\u000d\u000a      national and local levels, across a range of areas:\u000d\u000a    Impact on the use of HRIAs to assess international trade agreements:\u000d\u000a      Harrison's research was integral to the incorporation of the first ever\u000d\u000a      legally-binding human rights reporting process in an international trade\u000d\u000a      agreement. He was commissioned by the Canadian Council for International\u000d\u000a      Co-operation (see 5b) to apply his research (3b) to the Canada-Colombia\u000d\u000a      context and his resulting paper, Conducting A Human Rights Impact\u000d\u000a        Assessment Of The Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement: Key Issues,\u000d\u000a      was a major influence on the policy debate, both in parliament and in\u000d\u000a      civil society campaigns. He presented it to key parliamentarians and civil\u000d\u000a      society actors (via webcast seminars), gave evidence to the subsequent\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary enquiry into the Canada-Columbia Free Trade Agreement (FTA)\u000d\u000a      (see 5g), and was part of a small expert advisory group advising the\u000d\u000a      Canadian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the appropriate\u000d\u000a      methodology for the Canada-Colombia FTA reporting process (5b). The\u000d\u000a      agreement concerning annual reports on human rights and free trade between\u000d\u000a      Canada and Colombia was signed in May 2010 and the free trade agreement\u000d\u000a      was implemented in 2011. Harrison has since given evidence to\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary hearings in relation to the first year of the reporting\u000d\u000a      process (5b).\u000d\u000a    Harrison's work has also informed the development of policy on HRIAs\u000d\u000a      within the United Nations. In June 2010 the UN Special Rapporteur on Food,\u000d\u000a      Professor Olivier De Schutter (5a), convened a meeting of experts in\u000d\u000a      Geneva to advance methodologies and thinking for undertaking HRIAs for\u000d\u000a      trade and investment agreements. Harrison was commissioned to produce the\u000d\u000a      main background paper for the meeting, applying research in his 2008 and\u000d\u000a      2011 articles (3b and c) to the UN context. He subsequently formed part of\u000d\u000a      a small expert group responsible for assisting the UN Special Rapporteur\u000d\u000a      in drafting the UN Guiding Principles of Human Rights Impact\u000d\u000a        Assessments of Trade and Investment Agreements (see 5a and f). These\u000d\u000a      principles are now the key reference document for States that are\u000d\u000a      undertaking HRIAs.\u000d\u000a    Harrison has also provided research evidence to the UN Office of the High\u000d\u000a      Commissioner for Human Rights, having been commissioned to produce a major\u000d\u000a      study of the impact of international trade and investment agreements on\u000d\u000a      the protection and promotion of human rights. The resulting Study on\u000d\u000a        Human Rights Trade and Investment (forthcoming) includes detailed\u000d\u000a      analysis and guidance for conducting an HREIA of a trade agreement (see\u000d\u000a      5a).\u000d\u000a    Impact on the methodology for conducting HRIAs of trade agreements:\u000d\u000a      Harrison's research has also been vital to a number of individual HRIA\u000d\u000a      studies conducted by the UN and civil society organisations including an\u000d\u000a      HRIA of the PACER-Plus trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand\u000d\u000a      and the Pacific Island countries; an HRIA of the EU-India FTA; a study of\u000d\u000a      the impact of PACER-plus on the Pacific Island of Vanuatu and a study of\u000d\u000a      the impact of intellectual property provisions in bilateral trade\u000d\u000a      agreements on farmers' livelihoods in three different developing\u000d\u000a      countries. His research is referenced in all of these studies, and his\u000d\u000a      methodological insights have been utilised extensively (see e.g. 5e and\u000d\u000a      h). In addition, his research findings on institutional arrangements for\u000d\u000a      HRIAs (3b) have been utilised as the basis for the work of the Alternative\u000d\u000a      Trade Mandate Alliance (a network representing over 100 member\u000d\u000a      organisations across Europe) in their campaign for a reformed EU Trade\u000d\u000a      Policy (5e).\u000d\u000a    Impact on the methodology for conducting EHRIAs of policy: As a\u000d\u000a      result of the work described above, CHIP was commissioned by the SHRC to\u000d\u000a      undertake a study which critically evaluated both equality and human\u000d\u000a      rights impact assessment across the full range of policy areas where\u000d\u000a      studies have been undertaken. Human Rights Impact Assessment: Review\u000d\u000a        of Practice &amp; Guidance for Future Assessments (3c) led to the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Commissioner for Children and Young People reforming its\u000d\u000a      methodology for conducting EHRIAs. It was welcomed by the Chair of the\u000d\u000a      SHRC as `an extremely valuable contribution to both to the\u000d\u000a        Commission's own work and that of other practitioners and civil society\u000d\u000a        groups working to eliminate and mitigate the negative human rights\u000d\u000a        impacts of policy and decision making' (5c).\u000d\u000a    The research is also the basis for on-going work between the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Society of\u000d\u000a      Local Authority Chief Executives, the Scottish Council Equalities Network,\u000d\u000a      the NHS\/SG Health Directorate, Audit Scotland, the Association of Chief\u000d\u000a      Police Officers in Scotland and the Scottish Prison Service, including the\u000d\u000a      piloting of joint EHRIAs throughout Scotland. Harrison has provided\u000d\u000a      research evidence to all these groups and has drafted Guiding Principles\u000d\u000a      based on his research for conducting future EHRIAs. He is currently acting\u000d\u000a      as advisor to a project where the new approach advocated by his research\u000d\u000a      will be piloted in two local authorities in Scotland (Fife and\u000d\u000a      Dumfriesshire) over the next 18 months. Leicestershire County Council have\u000d\u000a      also utilised the SHRC research as the basis for reforming their own EHRIA\u000d\u000a      process (5c).\u000d\u000a    Following this, the Joint Committee on Human Rights' Report on the\u000d\u000a        Implementation of the Right of Disabled People to Independent Living\u000d\u000a      recommended that the Government should publish an integrated human rights\u000d\u000a      and equality impact assessment of the likely cumulative impact of the\u000d\u000a      proposals on independent living, based on the methodology developed for\u000d\u000a      the SHRC (5c). Impact on policy debate by conducting EHRIAs: The\u000d\u000a      two EHRIAs (3e and f) undertaken jointly with Coventry Women's Voices, an\u000d\u000a      umbrella organisation representing around 150 organisations and\u000d\u000a      individuals (including Coventry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre, Foleshill\u000d\u000a      Women's Training, Valley House, Coventry Haven, Unite the Union and\u000d\u000a      Coventry Ethnic Minority Action Partnership) in order to assess the impact\u000d\u000a      of the public sector spending cuts on the human rights of women in\u000d\u000a      Coventry, have enhanced public understanding of the issues, provided\u000d\u000a      research evidence that has stimulated debate both locally and nationally,\u000d\u000a      led to changes in policy, and inspired research by a range of voluntary\u000d\u000a      organisations (5d and j).\u000d\u000a    The three studies have been widely disseminated, with public launches\u000d\u000a      both locally and nationally, widespread media coverage, and over 15,000\u000d\u000a      downloads from the website. The studies have been discussed in two UK\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary debates, with Geoffrey Robinson MP predicting that they\u000d\u000a      would be seen as a `landmark' (Hansard, 12 July 2011) and Yvette Cooper\u000d\u000a      identifying them as a model for future research on the impact of the cuts\u000d\u000a      (Hansard, 8 June 2011).\u000d\u000a    Councillor Ann Lucas, leader of Coventry City Council, commented that `the\u000a        reports have had a huge impact both in Coventry and nationally' and\u000d\u000a      identified that their key contribution was to `bring together all the\u000d\u000a        different effects of the cuts and demonstrate clearly how it is the\u000d\u000a        combined impact that is most devastating'. She also commented: `I\u000d\u000a        am often down in Westminster and see both MPs and peers carrying around\u000d\u000a        copies of these reports with them and referring to them frequently -\u000d\u000a        they should be compulsory reading' (5j).\u000d\u000a    The research also informed the production of a toolkit for the Trades\u000d\u000a      Union Congress (5i) and has also inspired women's groups in Bristol,\u000d\u000a      Islington, Liverpool, Yorkshire and the North East (5d and j) to undertake\u000d\u000a      EHRIAs directly utilising the methodology in the Coventry study, which in\u000d\u000a      turn are having an impact across the country. As Mott (5d), chair of\u000d\u000a      Bristol Fawcett Society noted, `[o]n the basis of the work done by\u000d\u000a        [CHIP], we were able to produce our own report on the impact of the cuts\u000d\u000a        on women in Bristol. The report had a big impact in Bristol, was\u000d\u000a        referred to by officers in the drafting of their budgets, and has meant\u000d\u000a        that the Council is now more willing and able to engage with the issues\u000d\u000a        we have identified as they make their tough spending decisions.'\u000d\u000a    CHIP has been awarded an ESRC Collaborative Studentship Investigating\u000d\u000a      Cuts and Changes to Legal Advice Services (2012-2015) to continue this\u000d\u000a      work and the Barrow Cadbury Trust, an independent charitable foundation,\u000d\u000a      has funded a third report launched in 2013, assessing the human rights and\u000d\u000a      equality impact of the spending cuts on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic\u000d\u000a      women (5d and j).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The research examines how the use of norms and standards of human rights\u000d\u000a      and equality law are used to measure human rights performance through\u000d\u000a      `human rights and equality impact assessment'.

However, until\u000d\u000a      recently there has been relatively little consensus on how such\u000d\u000a      assessments should be conducted, nor has there been a great deal of\u000d\u000a      critical engagement with existing practice. In order to address this gap\u000d\u000a      in understanding, James Harrison (Assistant Professor at Warwick 2008-\u000d\u000a      2010, Associate Professor 2010-present), undertook research evaluating\u000d\u000a      their use, exploring their normative foundations, and devising proposals\u000d\u000a      for how practice can be enhanced in the future. The research, carried out\u000d\u000a      with the support of colleagues in the Law School's Centre for Human Rights\u000d\u000a      in Practice (CHIP), led to the development of an eight-step methodology\u000d\u000a      for undertaking impact assessments and principles for ensuring that the\u000d\u000a      methodology is carried out appropriately. It also identified the\u000d\u000a      institutional architecture, and checks and balances that are required to\u000d\u000a      make such assessments effective.\u000d\u000a    This research has resulted in a number of academic publications (see e.g.\u000d\u000a      3a, b and d); 2 major commissioned reports (for the Office of the UN High\u000d\u000a      Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the SHRC (3c)); and 2 other\u000d\u000a      specially commissioned papers (for the UN Special Rapporteur on Food and\u000d\u000a      the Canadian Council on International Co-operation), as well as a range of\u000d\u000a      collaborative research projects (3e and f).\u000d\u000a    Harrison's research initially focused on the use of HRIAs in the field of\u000d\u000a      international trade law, including the value and limitations of such\u000d\u000a      assessments of trade agreements; key methodological issues in undertaking\u000d\u000a      assessments, and the extent to which they have the potential to enhance\u000d\u000a      wider debates about human rights law and trade law inter-linkages in the\u000d\u000a      future. The Human Rights Impact of the World Trade Organisation\u000d\u000a      (3a) explained why human rights are an important mechanism for assessing\u000d\u000a      the social justice impact of the international trading system. His 2008\u000d\u000a      article (3b: with Goller), funded by a British Academy grant, identified\u000d\u000a      existing good practice in the field and key areas where methodologies\u000d\u000a      needed enhancement.\u000d\u000a    Later research critically evaluated the use of HRIAs across the full\u000d\u000a      range of policy areas where such work had been undertaken. Human\u000d\u000a        Rights Impact Assessment: Review of Practice &amp; Guidance for Future\u000d\u000a        Assessments (3c) was carried out with Stephenson (then an\u000d\u000a      independent researcher and now studying for a PhD within CHIP under an\u000d\u000a      ESRC-awarded scholarship). This originated as a study commissioned by the\u000d\u000a      SHRC and then continued as an independent research project. The study\u000d\u000a      reviewed existing practice, made detailed recommendations on how future\u000d\u000a      HRIAs should be conducted, and set out for the first time the eight core\u000d\u000a      elements that should be included in an HRIA in any field. Harrison's 2011\u000d\u000a      article (3d) built upon this research and highlighted good and bad\u000d\u000a      practice with regard to each element.\u000d\u000a    A final strand of the research focuses on the use of joint human rights\u000d\u000a      and equality impact assessment in the UK as a mechanism for evaluating the\u000d\u000a      degree to which public spending cuts are complying with equality and human\u000d\u000a      rights obligations under the Equality Act 2010 and Human Rights Act 1998.\u000d\u000a      Unravelling Equality?

The empirical\u000d\u000a      findings informed the recommendation of the 1993 Royal Commission (5a)\u000d\u000a      that all those providing legal advice at police stations should be trained\u000d\u000a      and accredited to avoid the poor quality of legal advice identified in the\u000d\u000a      research. This proposition was adopted as policy by the Legal Aid Board\u000d\u000a      (now the Legal Services Commission) and the Law Society, and a quality\u000d\u000a      assessment programme for defence lawyers was rolled out nationally across\u000d\u000a      England and Wales (the Criminal Litigation Accreditation Scheme Police\u000d\u000a      Station Qualification). This accreditation scheme ensures that only those\u000d\u000a      who are appropriately qualified in providing effective defence assistance\u000d\u000a      at the police station are able to do so. The 10,000 individuals currently\u000d\u000a      providing police station advice are all accredited under this scheme:\u000d\u000a      moreover, since it requires them to undertake continuing professional\u000d\u000a      development, it continues to have an impact on the training of those\u000d\u000a      accredited before 2008, as well as those who have undertaken the programme\u000d\u000a      after that date.\u000d\u000a    Subsequent projects have incorporated training as an explicit element.\u000d\u000a      The Impact of Legal Representation research (3f) underpinned\u000d\u000a      training provided in 2013 to 32 lawyers to improve the quality of their\u000d\u000a      work on CCRC applications. This was a collaboration between the CCRC and\u000d\u000a      the Warwick authors: it has improved lawyers' ability to represent\u000d\u000a      applicants effectively, and enhanced the CCRC's ability to work\u000d\u000a      effectively with stakeholders. Feedback from the event showed that\u000d\u000a      participants found it useful. A Commissioner commented that the training\u000d\u000a      provided `further knowledge of effective representation, will assist with\u000d\u000a      screening and reviews and could help identify miscarriages of justice.'\u000d\u000a      Feedback from lawyers indicated that as a result of the training they had\u000d\u000a      a better understanding of the CCRC, and would be able to advise their\u000d\u000a      clients more effectively. They noted that they were more likely to refer a\u000d\u000a      case to the CCRC and more confident about their chances of success in\u000d\u000a      doing so (5j). Similarly, the empirical findings from Inside Police\u000d\u000a        Custody project (3g) underpinned a training syllabus that was\u000d\u000a      piloted with 29 police officers and lawyers in the UK and the Netherlands\u000d\u000a      in April 2013. The practical application of legal and professional\u000d\u000a      responsibilities developed the practitioner skills necessary to deliver\u000d\u000a      suspects' rights more effectively across EU jurisdictions and beyond.\u000d\u000a      Participants reported that the training had a direct impact on their work,\u000d\u000a      leading them to re-evaluate their approach to key practices in the\u000d\u000a      delivery of suspects' rights.\u000d\u000a    Impact on access to justice: Custodial Legal Advice (3a)\u000d\u000a      and Standing Accused (3b) have had a significant impact nationwide\u000d\u000a      on the quality of legal advice available to those accused of crimes in\u000d\u000a      England and Wales. The changes to training and accreditation led to the\u000d\u000a      embedding of adversarial values into the police station training and\u000d\u000a      accreditation scheme, which has been crucial to its success. Independent\u000d\u000a      research, directly comparing the data from the 1993 study with advice\u000d\u000a      provided several years later, concluded that the introduction of the\u000d\u000a      accreditation scheme improved significantly the quality of legal advice in\u000d\u000a      police stations (5b). Although the research began to have an impact prior\u000d\u000a      to 2008, it continues to have a direct day-to-day impact in every police\u000d\u000a      station across England and Wales. Its reach is therefore extremely\u000d\u000a      substantial as it affects all suspects taken into custody who exercise\u000d\u000a      their right to legal assistance: around 3.3 million of the 8.2 million\u000d\u000a      suspects arrested since 2008 have received legal advice by an accredited\u000d\u000a      adviser under this scheme. Its significance lies in the improved quality\u000d\u000a      of legal advice received as a result of accreditation. Overall, it has had\u000d\u000a      a real impact on access to justice.\u000d\u000a    Hodgson has also had an impact on access to justice in a number of\u000d\u000a      significant cases. Based on her research, she has frequently been\u000d\u000a      instructed as an expert witness on whether European extradition was for\u000d\u000a      the lawful purpose of prosecution, or simply for investigation and\u000d\u000a      questioning. [McCormack v Tribunal de Grande Instance, Quimper, France\u000d\u000a      [2008] EWHC 1453 (Admin) (5d); Tribunal de Grande Instance de Bourg en\u000d\u000a        Bresse, France v Fatma Selcuck (2010); HM Advocate, representing\u000d\u000a        Republic of France v Kelly (2010)]. She testified at the hearing in\u000d\u000a      McCormack and in Kelly, the appeal was abandoned as a\u000d\u000a      direct result of the expert report provided. Her research also had an\u000d\u000a      impact on the major Canadian extradition decision in Diab, in\u000d\u000a      which she was required to assess whether, if extradited to France on\u000d\u000a      terrorism charges, the accused would receive a fair trial [Attorney\u000d\u000a        General of Canada (The Republic of France) v Diab 2011 ONSC 337].\u000d\u000a      Drawing on French Criminal Justice (3c) and Terrorist Suspects\u000d\u000a      (3d), her assessment of the use of secret and un-sourced\u000d\u000a      intelligence as evidence in any subsequent trial should Diab be extradited\u000d\u000a      back to France was relied upon by Diab's defence team. Diab's lawyer noted\u000d\u000a      that Hodgson's research had `a considerable positive impact...on the\u000d\u000a      quality of the defence afforded Dr Diab and on the protection of his legal\u000d\u000a      and constitutional rights as a person sought by France in relation to a\u000d\u000a      1980 terrorist bombing in Paris' and `led directly to the Attorney General\u000d\u000a      for Canada disavowing any reliance whatsoever on the extensive\u000d\u000a      intelligence set out in the French Record of the Case which sought to\u000d\u000a      justify the French extradition request' (5h). While the judge felt legally\u000d\u000a      mandated to extradite under the relevant treaty, the case is currently on\u000d\u000a      appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court.\u000d\u000a    Impact on the implementation of policy in Scotland: The Criminal\u000d\u000a      Procedure (Legal Assistance, Detention and Appeals) (Scotland) Act 2010\u000d\u000a      made new provision for the right of a detained suspect to access to a\u000d\u000a      lawyer. Together with Jodie Blackstock from JUSTICE (5f), and drawing\u000d\u000a      directly on the 1993 research (3a), Hodgson provided training to more than\u000d\u000a      60 Scottish lawyers in 2011, to alert lawyers to the crucial importance of\u000d\u000a      their newly established role at the police station and the need for\u000d\u000a      personal attendance rather than telephone advice. The findings from her\u000d\u000a      research and the impact of the reforms on practice were distilled into a\u000d\u000a      short guide for those attending (Police Station Advice: Promoting Best\u000d\u000a        Practice).\u000d\u000a    Subsequently, in 2012, Lord Carloway's Review of new arrangements\u000d\u000a      allowing lawyers into the police station in Scotland, drew on this\u000d\u000a      briefing and Custodial Legal Advice (3a) to highlight the\u000d\u000a      importance of training in ensuring high quality provision of advice, as\u000d\u000a      well as the importance of retaining the right to silence (5c). It noted\u000d\u000a      that in order for the right of access to a solicitor to be effective,\u000d\u000a      those advising clients `must have adequate training' and noted the `need\u000d\u000a      to guard against complacency in this area' in the light of the research\u000d\u000a      findings from England and Wales (para 6.1.35). It specifically recommended\u000d\u000a      that `University Law Schools and the Law Society should be encouraged to\u000d\u000a      formulate guidance for solicitors in advising clients in a police\u000d\u000a      station'.\u000d\u000a    The Impact of Legal Representation research (3f) has also had an\u000d\u000a      impact on the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, stimulating it to\u000d\u000a      carry out its own assessment of the impact of legal representation,\u000d\u000a      explicitly mirroring the study carried out by Hodgson.\u000d\u000a    Impact on the development of EU policy: Hodgson's research on both\u000d\u000a      English and French criminal justice has provided evidence to inform the\u000d\u000a      development of EU policy.

It involved direct observation of\u000d\u000a      the provision of legal advice to suspects in police custody by legal\u000d\u000a      advisers in 26 firms and 3 agencies. It highlighted the deficiencies of\u000d\u000a      the system then in operation: the absence of training and clear quality\u000d\u000a      standards for police station advisers; the lack of professional\u000d\u000a      regulation; and the widespread delegation of custodial legal advice work\u000d\u000a      by solicitors to the least experienced member of the firm - resulting in\u000d\u000a      suspects `appearing' to benefit from legal assistance, but in fact\u000d\u000a      receiving poor quality legal advice.\u000d\u000a    The related, larger project, Standing Accused (3b: 1994), was the\u000d\u000a      first of this size and nature. Carried out by Hodgson and McConville\u000d\u000a      together with Warwick Senior Research Fellow, Lee Bridges, it involved\u000d\u000a      direct observations of 48 firms and 3 agencies in England and Wales, over\u000d\u000a      198 researcher weeks. It demonstrated the limitations of the way in which\u000d\u000a      custodial legal advice was provided in the context of the\u000d\u000a      (inappropriately) non-adversarial culture of criminal defence work.\u000d\u000a    Building on this tradition of empirical research, French Criminal\u000d\u000a        Justice (3c: 2005) was a major empirical study by Hodgson of the\u000d\u000a      investigation and prosecution of crime in France, consisting of 18 months\u000d\u000a      of fieldwork and 20 interviews across six sites. It investigated the ways\u000d\u000a      in which defence rights are protected through a procedural model centring\u000d\u000a      on judicial supervision, in contrast to the adversarial and more\u000d\u000a      lawyer-centred process in England and Wales. It showed how the close\u000d\u000a      working relationships between police, prosecutors and judges, together\u000d\u000a      with the dependence on mutual trust, mean that models of supervision often\u000d\u000a      simply legitimate police accounts, and provide them with the credibility\u000d\u000a      of appearing to be the product of a judicial investigation, with the gap\u000d\u000a      between theory and practice again leaving the accused largely unprotected.\u000d\u000a    Hodgson's subsequent Home Office commissioned study (The Investigation\u000d\u000a        and Prosecution of Terrorist Suspects in France (3d: 2006)) found\u000d\u000a      that this feature is most marked in terrorism investigations, where\u000d\u000a      investigating judges work with intelligence officers, with the result that\u000d\u000a      secret and untested intelligence appears as `evidence' in the case file,\u000d\u000a      with no opportunity for defence challenge. This later study was\u000d\u000a      commissioned to inform government policy on the possible use of intercept\u000d\u000a      material as evidence at trial, drawing on French experience.\u000d\u000a    Building on her expertise in English and French criminal justice more\u000d\u000a      generally, in 2007 she collaborated with academics and practitioners on Suspects\u000a        in Europe (3e). This provided a `law in action' account of criminal\u000d\u000a      procedure in 8 countries, using a common scenario to illustrate how the\u000d\u000a      criminal process plays out in practice.\u000d\u000a    The empirical study Impact of Legal Representation (3f: 2009) was\u000d\u000a      carried out by Hodgson with Warwick researcher Juliet Horne. Drawing on\u000d\u000a      Hodgson's insights into criminal defence lawyering, together with her\u000d\u000a      understanding of inquisitorial procedures as they operate in France and\u000d\u000a      elsewhere, it demonstrated the potential impact of good quality legal\u000d\u000a      representation of applicants to the CCRC, through an examination of\u000d\u000a      applications and decisions, as well as interviews with lawyers and\u000d\u000a      Commission staff. It challenged the assumption that as an inquisitorial\u000d\u000a      procedure, CCRC investigations did not benefit from the assistance of\u000d\u000a      lawyers representing the applicant. It demonstrated the ways that lawyers\u000d\u000a      could assist both applicants and the Commission.\u000d\u000a    A final project, Inside Police Custody (3g: 2013) was carried out\u000d\u000a      with researchers from the UK, France and the Netherlands. Building further\u000d\u000a      on Suspects in Europe and on Hodgson's empirical research in\u000d\u000a      England and Wales and in France, which demonstrated the importance of\u000d\u000a      legal and occupational cultures as factors limiting the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      defence rights in practice, this study adopted a similar qualitative\u000d\u000a      methodology. Observations and interviews were carried out across four\u000d\u000a      jurisdictions over a 14-month period. This project provided a detailed\u000d\u000a      insight into suspects' rights and in particular, models of defence\u000d\u000a      provision and the factors affecting the quality of advice received by\u000d\u000a      suspects in different countries. Reinforcing the findings of Hodgson's\u000d\u000a      earlier studies, the research demonstrated that training of police and\u000d\u000a      lawyers, together with mechanisms to ensure the quality of defence advice,\u000d\u000a      are essential across inquisitorial as well as adversarial procedural\u000d\u000a      traditions, if suspects are to receive effective legal assistance. The\u000d\u000a      findings interrogate how EU legislation can make suspects' rights to\u000d\u000a      lawyers, interpreters and case information, more effective.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2544","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aResearch on human rights accountability with respect to post-conflict and transitional societies\u000d\u000ainforms EHRAC's programme of litigation before the ECtHR (300 cases, on behalf of 1,100\u000d\u000aapplicants), including: victims of disappearances, extra-judicial executions, unlawful detention, ill-treatment\u000d\u000aand other violations of the ECHR (arising predominantly in Chechnya but also in South\u000d\u000aOssetia, Nagorno-Karabkh and the North Caucasus).

This corpus of work identified problems of evidence-gathering, and the lacunae in\u000d\u000anorms of accountability which are accentuated during internal conflict and states of emergency.\u000d\u000aThis research informed Leach's successful Nuffield Foundation project (2008-09), which examined\u000d\u000athe effectiveness of the European Court's investigative fact-finding procedure (an exceptional\u000d\u000aprocedure in which the Court holds in-country witness hearings, because of the absence of any\u000d\u000aprior effective domestic proceedings, for example during states of emergency). The research\u000d\u000ascrutinised the rules of evidence applied by the ECtHR, in particular the standard of proof (`beyond\u000d\u000areasonable doubt'), as well as the conduct and experience of past fact-finding missions. These\u000d\u000athemes were developed in a 2010 article in the Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights [2]. These\u000d\u000aand other developments assessing the Court's practice and procedure were discussed extensively\u000d\u000ain Leach's 2005 book Taking a Case to the European Court of Human Rights [3], a substantially\u000d\u000arevised third edition of which was published by Oxford University Press in 2011. This book in\u000d\u000aparticular is widely recognised as being crucial for anyone contemplating engaging with the\u000d\u000aECtHR. In his role as someone closely involved with the ECtHR system, Leach has also published\u000d\u000ainfluential research identifying reforms to the Court's practice in the European Human Rights Law\u000d\u000aReview [4]. His research findings have since been utilised to inform EHRAC's extensive\u000d\u000aprogramme of strategic litigation before the ECtHR (covering more than 300 cases), including\u000d\u000alitigation related to conflict in Chechnya, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh.\u000d\u000a(ii) Theoretical and practical approaches to large-scale human rights violations in Europe\u000d\u000aLeach's article in European Human Rights Law Review (2005) [4] analysed the ECtHR's `pilot\u000d\u000ajudgment procedure' (PJP). This had been introduced in 2004 as an effective new mechanism for\u000d\u000aresponding to large-scale human rights violations in Europe and for managing the ECtHR's\u000d\u000abacklog of 150,000 cases. These challenges were further investigated in other books and articles\u000d\u000ain 2010 [5]. This phase of research was made possible by Leach's success in attracting a\u000d\u000aLeverhulme Trust research grant, 2009-10 (&#163;65,433 - for research in Italy, Poland and Slovenia); it\u000d\u000aexamined: i) the rationale for the ECtHR's use of the PJP; ii) de-facto constitutional change, with\u000d\u000athe Court moving away from individual justice towards enforcing legislative change; iii) the\u000d\u000adomestic implementation of changes introduced with the aim of ending systemic human rights\u000d\u000aabuses.

Blackstone's\u000d\u000a      Criminal Practice (BCP) is available in all Crown Courts, and is widely\u000d\u000a      used and referred to by practitioners and judges both in everyday practice\u000d\u000a      and in trial courts and in appellate courts creating new law. A Westlaw\u000d\u000a      search in March 2011 produced over 100 cases where Blackstone was cited in\u000d\u000a      reported cases since 1993, 29 of these being in the period since 2008.\u000d\u000a    The most relevant recent evidence of this impact is in R v Gnango\u000d\u000a      [2011] UKSC 59 (a Supreme Court decision on a complex complicity and\u000d\u000a      murder problem), where Blackstone was referred to on two separate points\u000d\u000a      and (Taylor's) Chapter A2.11 designation of transferred malice as being\u000d\u000a      better expressed as transferred mens rea, referred to approvingly. This is\u000d\u000a      not put forward as a particularly significant doctrinal issue in itself\u000d\u000a      but as an example of the way in which BCP is taken seriously right up to\u000d\u000a      the very highest levels.\u000d\u000a    A further, more pervasive, example is found in the comprehensive 2010\u000d\u000a      Revision of the Judicial Studies Board Crown Court Benchbook, which\u000d\u000a      consistently refers to the relevant parts of Blackstone at the end of each\u000d\u000a      section (a large number of these references being to Taylor's material) so\u000d\u000a      that Judges are constantly being referred to BCP for further analysis\u000d\u000a      where needed to cater for the particular aspects of the case before them.\u000d\u000a      In the summer of 2010 (Taylor's) Chapter B1 on Homicide covering the\u000d\u000a      changes to partial defences to murder brought about by the Coroners and\u000d\u000a      Justice Act 2009 was distributed to judges authorised to try murder at a\u000d\u000a      judicial college serious crime course, in preparation for the\u000d\u000a      implementation of the Act as from October 2010. (See Asmelash\u000d\u000a      [2013] EWCA Crim 157 for a recent example of BCP being cited, in this case\u000d\u000a      by Lord Judge CJ in interpreting the new partial defence to murder of loss\u000d\u000a      of control).\u000d\u000a    This ongoing process of impact on substantial doctrinal issues is also\u000d\u000a      evidenced through highly significant appellate decisions which have\u000d\u000a      effectively created new law, and which continue to have impact albeit some\u000d\u000a      of the decisions themselves were prior to 2008. Such cases are exemplified\u000d\u000a      by Millward 1994 Crim LR 527 (see REF2 output 2 for more on\u000d\u000a      development of this principle); Gilmour 2000 2 Cr App R 407 (at p.\u000d\u000a      414) ; and Bryce [2004] 2 Cr App R 592 (paras 49, 62, 63 and 70).\u000d\u000a      In each of these, the Court of Appeal adopted very substantial passages\u000d\u000a      from Taylor's work in Blackstone, in creating principles to deal with\u000d\u000a      contentious issues in complicity which are still live today, for example\u000d\u000a    a) where or when an accessory can be liable even though the principal is\u000d\u000a      acquitted (ongoing impact illustrated by the fact that it is referred to\u000d\u000a      in a leading text also frequently cited in appellate courts, Smith and\u000d\u000a      Hogan, as \"the rule in Millward\");\u000d\u000a    b) where or when an accessory can or should be liable for manslaughter\u000d\u000a      where the principal is liable for murder despite divergent mens rea;\u000d\u000a      (Gilmour)\u000d\u000a    c) the meaning of intention to encourage or assist in accessory liability\u000d\u000a      generally.

Taylor has been\u000d\u000a      involved in this process throughout in a number of ways, as a result in\u000d\u000a      particular of his articles on homicide and complicity, (outputs iv), v)\u000d\u000a      and vi) in part 3 above). Output iv) had already been the main basis of\u000d\u000a      the contents of Appendix H of the Law Commission's CP on Homicide in the\u000d\u000a      first stages of the Review in 2005 (see para H3 for express\u000d\u000a      acknowledgement). Outputs v) and vi) were critiques of the Law Commission\u000d\u000a      Reports on Murder and Complicity respectively, critiques which led to\u000d\u000a      constructive email and other discussions with the then Law Commissioner\u000d\u000a      for Criminal Law (Professor Jeremy Horder) and subsequently to invitations\u000d\u000a      from the MoJ to participate in and contribute to the stakeholder workshops\u000d\u000a      in 2008 dealing with complicity and homicide which influenced the final\u000d\u000a      content of the 2009 Act.\u000d\u000a    Taylor was sole academic participant in the first by-invitation\u000d\u000a      stakeholder workshop on complicity and murder prior to the issue of the\u000d\u000a      MoJ's Consultation Paper in 2008; and along with three other academics\u000d\u000a      (Professors David Ormerod, Ian Dennis and John Spencer) he participated in\u000d\u000a      a further stakeholder workshop to consider the published proposals, the\u000d\u000a      other invitees including representatives of the judiciary, CPS, CCRC, MoJ,\u000d\u000a      Law Commission and other agencies and stakeholders. The discussions at the\u000d\u000a      workshops persuaded the MoJ that, given the government's decision not to\u000d\u000a      progress for the time being with the reforms to the law of murder, an\u000d\u000a      attempt to reform the law of complicity as applied to murder (in isolation\u000d\u000a      from reforms to the more general law of complicity) would create more\u000d\u000a      problems than it would solve. The substantial section in Professor\u000d\u000a      Horder's 2012 book referred to at the end of section 3 of this case study\u000d\u000a      is further evidence of the impact of Taylor's work on the thinking of law\u000d\u000a      reform bodies.\u000d\u000a    A more recent example of ongoing impact is to be found in the\u000d\u000a      acknowledgement of Taylor's assistance (alongside that of ten other named\u000d\u000a      individuals) at para 1.42 of the Law Commission Consultation Paper No 213,\u000d\u000a      June 2013, Hate Crime: The case for extending the existing offences.\u000d\u000a      (Taylor first wrote about the existing offences when they were first\u000d\u000a      introduced in one of the chapters he was responsible for in Blackstone's\u000d\u000a      Guide to the CDA 1998 -output ii) in section 3 above.)\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This research has made a sustained and continuing impact on the\u000d\u000a      development and application of the substantive criminal law, including mens\u000d\u000a        rea and general defences, and especially in the areas of complicity\u000d\u000a      and homicide, in terms of\u000d\u000a    i) development of the law by the appellate courts;\u000d\u000a    ii) application of the law by practitioners; and\u000d\u000a    iii) government policy as to the reform of the law of murder and\u000d\u000a      complicity.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN)\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Central Lancashire (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Central Lancashire","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007141}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000ai) Blackstone's Criminal Practice, annual edition (in particular his\u000d\u000a      Chapters A2 (Mens Rea), A3 (Defences) and A4 (Complicity- NB A4 was\u000d\u000a      A5 until 2011) and B1 (Homicide)\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000aii) Blackstone's Guide to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 Leng, Taylor\u000d\u000a      and Wasik, Blackstone Press 2008\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000aiii) Blackstone's Guide to the Criminal Justice Act 2003, Taylor, Leng\u000d\u000a      and Wasik, OUP 2004\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000aiv) Jury Unanimity in Homicide 2001 Crim LR 283 -300\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000av) The Nature of Partial Defences and the Coherence of (Second Degree)\u000d\u000a      Murder 2007 Crim LR 345 -359\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000avi) Procuring, Causation, Innocent Agency and the Law Commission 2008\u000d\u000a      Crim LR 32 -49 (listed in REF 2)\u000d\u000a    \u000aAs indicators of quality, the publications i) and ii) were submitted to\u000d\u000a      the 2001 RAE where the submission gained overall 4 out of 5.

Throughout that period he has been responsible for\u000d\u000a      the key relevant sections of the annual edition of Blackstone's Criminal\u000d\u000a      Practice (BCP), which has involved him in analysing, commenting on and\u000d\u000a      attempting to make sense of a wide variety of new developments in case law\u000d\u000a      and legislation, including as recent examples the Corporate Manslaughter\u000d\u000a      and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 and the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.\u000d\u000a      Chapters of BCP written by Taylor have been regularly cited, quoted and\u000d\u000a      adopted by appellate courts in developing and modifying existing legal\u000d\u000a      principles.\u000d\u000a    Taylor was also joint author of a number of well received books on\u000d\u000a      criminal justice legislation within the period (there were also two prior\u000d\u000a      to 1993) including the CJPO 1994, the CPIA 1996, the CDA 1998 and the CJA\u000d\u000a      2003. These books involved detailed research into the background and\u000d\u000a      context of the legislation, as well as the Parliamentary debates; they\u000d\u000a      also presented critical and evaluative comment and analysis which was\u000d\u000a      amongst the first resources available to those having to come to grips\u000d\u000a      with the legislation.

As there are no permitted conjugal visits\u000a      in UK prisons, they sought to\u000a      use artificial insemination, but were denied access to these facilities.\u000a      The barrister's argument\u000a      relied on Codd's analysis of the previous legal decisions in this and\u000a      similar cases. The Grand\u000a      Chamber held that it was a breach of Art. 8 ECHR for the state to refuse\u000a      access to artificial\u000a      insemination facilities to the non-imprisoned female partner of a\u000a      prisoner, as had happened in the\u000a      case of the applicant and his wife, on the grounds that the prisoner's\u000a      wife had not been convicted\u000a      of any offences and thus retained all the usual rights recognised under\u000a      Art. 8. Codd's work was\u000a      cited in the final judgment of the Court as part of its summary of the\u000a      successful applicants'\u000a      submissions. As a direct consequence of this judgment, the UK Ministry of\u000a      Justice had to\u000a      reconsider its policy immediately in order to comply with the decision of\u000a      the Court.

Since 1991 she has been employed at the submitting\u000a      institution, having been\u000a      initially appointed as a Lecturer in 1991 then progressively promoted to\u000a      Reader level. Her research\u000a      has focused specifically on the intersection of law, criminal justice and\u000a      penal policy, with a\u000a      significant emphasis on issues of gender. She has contributed to the\u000a      development of new\u000a      perspectives in penology, as an early writer on elderly prisoners, and in\u000a      her later research on\u000a      prisoners' families, resettlement and social capital, more recently\u000a      developing her work to include\u000a      wider global perspectives. She has been particularly original in that she\u000a      has integrated legal\u000a      analysis of the situation of prisoners' families with penological policy\u000a      analysis, in contrast with\u000a      much of the pre-existing research which has tended to focus on\u000a      criminological and sociological\u000a      perspectives. She has explored the relevance of the ECHR to rights claims\u000a      by prisoners and their\u000a      partners, most significantly in her work on access to artificial\u000a      insemination, which was cited before\u000a      the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights in the Dickson\u000a      case and which was\u000a      quoted with approval in the final judgment. Most recently, she has\u000a      developed global perspectives\u000a      on prisoners and their families: most previous research has tended to be\u000a      jurisdiction-focused\u000a      whereas Codd has sought to develop global feminist perspectives which\u000a      compare and contrast\u000a      experiences, laws and policies.\u000a    The key research insights or findings relate to the paradoxes inherent in\u000a      government policy in\u000a      relation to prisoners' families, which stresses the importance of the role\u000a      families can play in\u000a      encouraging and promoting desistance and prisoner resettlement, but also\u000a      renders it difficult in\u000a      practice for families to provide such support, due to institutional\u000a      regimes and negative and\u000a      stigmatising attitudes to family members of offenders. Her research with\u000a      Alice Mills (University of\u000a      Auckland, New Zealand), which considered questions of prisoners' families,\u000a      resettlement and\u000a      social capital, combined insights from the extensive and emergent\u000a      literature on social capital and\u000a      applied it to families of prisoners. The other key insight is the central\u000a      role that gender, and\u000a      gendered expectations that women act as caregivers, plays in the\u000a      experiences of families coping\u000a      with imprisonment. This gendered analysis extends to include the\u000a      stigmatisation of women when\u000a      associated with male offenders, highlighting the gendered differences in\u000a      media portrayals and\u000a      societal attitudes towards those associated with offenders.

Both\u000d\u000a      initiatives are designed in part (a) to enable Anglicanism globally to\u000d\u000a      re-assert its identity, credibility, and effectiveness; (b) to maintain\u000d\u000a      communion between its churches, at a time of serious discord over issues\u000d\u000a      of human sexuality; and (c) to provide a basic framework of `house rules'\u000d\u000a      for the Communion to address divisive issues which might arise in the\u000d\u000a      future. The steps leading to the impact in and beyond 2008 begin outside\u000d\u000a      the census period in 2001 and may be explained thus:\u000d\u000a    The Principles of Canon Law:\u000d\u000a    The Archbishop of Canterbury (Carey) invited Doe to speak at the 2001\u000d\u000a      Primates' Meeting (an annual meeting of Anglican archbishops worldwide)\u000d\u000a      about canon law and how it might contribute to Anglican unity globally.\u000d\u000a      Doe's paper3.2 explained his research, proposed articulation\u000d\u000a      of principles of canon law, and suggested that lawyers should meet to\u000d\u000a      explore whether these principles of Anglican canon law existed. The\u000d\u000a      following year at Canterbury, the Anglican Communion Legal Advisers\u000d\u000a      Consultation assembled lawyers from across the worldwide Communion (the\u000d\u000a      first such meeting in Anglican history) to discuss the idea; at the event\u000d\u000a      Doe engaged the lawyers in discussion of candidate principles he had\u000d\u000a      drafted in advance. The consultation accepted Doe's hypothesis. The\u000d\u000a      Primates endorsed this (recognising canon law as a `fifth instrument of\u000d\u000a      unity' in global Anglicanism alongside the Archbishop of Canterbury,\u000d\u000a      Primates Meeting, Lambeth Conference and Anglican Consultative Council),\u000d\u000a      and authorised the establishment of the Anglican Communion Legal Advisers\u000d\u000a      Network to move the project forward. The Network was set up formally by\u000d\u000a      the Anglican Consultative Council meeting in Hong Kong, after which Doe\u000d\u000a      was commissioned to produce a draft `statement of principles of Canon Law\u000d\u000a      common within the Communion'.

As a result, the Archbishop of Canterbury\u000d\u000a      (Williams) established the Lambeth Commission to address `the legal and\u000d\u000a      theological implications' of these decisions and to make `practical\u000d\u000a      recommendations for maintaining the highest degree of communion'. Doe was\u000d\u000a      appointed to the Commission and invited to write a briefing paper3.4\u000d\u000a      to steer the Commission on the issues, communion and autonomy. Doe\u000d\u000a      re-iterated his covenant proposal3.2, which was accepted by the\u000d\u000a      Commission, and Doe worked on a draft which was incorporated in the\u000d\u000a      Commission's Windsor Report (2004). Doe was also appointed consultant to\u000d\u000a      the Covenant Design Group established by the Archbishop of Canterbury to\u000d\u000a      take the project forward5.6. Doe gave presentations on the\u000d\u000a      Covenant at five separate sessions at the Lambeth Conference 2008. The\u000d\u000a      Design Group (Singapore, September 2008) considered that Conference's\u000d\u000a      reflections and later produced its final draft (March, 2009), using Doe's\u000d\u000a      suggestion that the covenant should embody the principle that `the\u000d\u000a      Communion guides, each church decides'3.5 as fundamental to the\u000d\u000a      covenantal relationship between communion and autonomy5.7. The\u000d\u000a      Standing Committee of the Anglican Communion agreed the final text in\u000d\u000a      December 2009 and the Anglican Communion Covenant was circulated to the 44\u000d\u000a      churches of the worldwide Communion for consideration and subsequent\u000d\u000a      ratification or rejection. The Covenant has stimulated debate and decision\u000d\u000a      making in each church about what communion and autonomy mean and how to\u000d\u000a      resolve conflicts amicably. Discussion within the churches took place not\u000d\u000a      only at the level of their national synods, but also at more grass roots\u000d\u000a      level in the dioceses, and in some cases in parishes. Thus far 9 churches\u000d\u000a      have ratified it (by adoption or subscription), 1 has rejected it, and 2\u000d\u000a      have declined to decide5.8. The Anglican Consultative Council\u000d\u000a      is currently reconsidering how to proceed given that the Church of England\u000d\u000a      is amongst those churches which have not ratified the Covenant.\u000d\u000a    In November 2012 the Director for Unity, Faith and Order at the Anglican\u000d\u000a      Communion Office wrote: `Norman Doe made a very significant contribution\u000d\u000a      to the development of the Anglican Communion Covenant, which is currently\u000d\u000a      being considered for adoption.... He originated the idea, drafted the\u000d\u000a      first version, participated in the design Group, and educated Anglicans\u000d\u000a      about it... Overall, the Covenant process has encouraged Anglicans to\u000d\u000a      think about what it means to be a church, and how to make decisions\u000d\u000a      together across cultural and theological difference'5.9.\u000d\u000a    Assessment of Doe's work by the former Archbishop of Canterbury:\u000d\u000a    Doe's work has contributed to a change in perception, posture and\u000d\u000a      practice in global Anglicanism. Former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Rowan\u000d\u000a      Williams, wrote in a statement that: `The work on Principles of Anglican\u000d\u000a      Canon Law was a groundbreaking project which made a huge contribution to\u000d\u000a      the self-awareness of the Communion internationally and is a lasting and\u000d\u000a      indispensable resource. The contribution made to the discussion and\u000d\u000a      refining of the 'Anglican Covenant' as a focus for convergence and mutual\u000d\u000a      accountability in the Communion was again indispensable. Despite mixed\u000d\u000a      responses, the quality of the work was universally acknowledged...\u000d\u000a      Professor Doe and his colleagues have done an enormous amount to provide\u000d\u000a      such a resource and to equip a great range of individuals'5.10.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Before 2008-9 the worldwide Anglican Communion had no global legal\u000d\u000a      framework for its 44 autonomous churches with their 80 million members.\u000d\u000a      Historically, the Communion has been maintained by mutual \"bonds of\u000d\u000a      affection\" held by members one for another on the basis of shared beliefs.\u000d\u000a      This is changing. The Principles of Canon Law Common to the Churches of\u000d\u000a      the Anglican Communion were launched at the Lambeth Conference in 2008,\u000d\u000a      while the Anglican Communion Covenant (2009) is currently before each\u000d\u000a      church for ratification.

Doe's (Professor, 01\/10\/85 - present) research seeks to challenge\u000d\u000a      this. In 1997 Doe compared the laws of the 44 autonomous churches of the\u000d\u000a      worldwide Anglican Communion - their constitutions, canons and other\u000d\u000a      regulatory instruments - in relation to church governance, ministry,\u000d\u000a      doctrine, liturgy, ritual (e.g. baptism, holy communion, marriage),\u000d\u000a      ecumenism, property and finance. This was the first time such an exercise\u000d\u000a      had been undertaken. The study uncovered similarities and differences\u000d\u000a      between these legal systems. It proposed that from the similarities\u000d\u000a      emerged shared legal principles which (a) dispelled the common assumption\u000d\u000a      that the churches were different in terms of polity; (b) contributed to a\u000d\u000a      greater understanding of Anglican identity worldwide from a juridical\u000d\u000a      perspective, rather than the theological perspective hitherto dominating\u000d\u000a      Anglican thought; and (c) could be used as a practical resource by\u000d\u000a      churches considering legal reform. It was published in 19983.1.\u000d\u000a    In 2001 Doe proposed in a paper3.2, that the Anglican\u000d\u000a      Communion should formulate (a) a statement of the principles of canon law\u000d\u000a      common to its churches and (b) a concordat or covenant for adoption by its\u000d\u000a      churches to regulate their relations. The two initiatives were also\u000d\u000a      intended to assist ecumenical partners of Anglicans (e.g. Roman Catholics,\u000d\u000a      Orthodox, Lutherans) in their understanding of Anglicanism globally. From\u000d\u000a      2002-2005, helped by D'Auria (research assistant, Cardiff Centre for Law\u000d\u000a      and Religion), Doe drafted 100 macro- and over 600 micro-principles of\u000d\u000a      Anglican canon law induced from similarities between the laws of the\u000d\u000a      Communion's churches. This involved gathering and studying the latest\u000d\u000a      versions of texts of the laws of each church, devising a system by which\u000d\u000a      to compare particular rules within them and by which to identify what\u000d\u000a      constituted a common principle, comparing them with rigorous attention to\u000d\u000a      detail, and articulating similarities as shared principles - a revised\u000d\u000a      version was published in 2008, with a reflection by Doe3.3, and\u000d\u000a      launched at the Lambeth Conference that year (see Section 4).\u000d\u000a    In 2003, Doe (again aided by D'Auria) explored the meaning of and\u000d\u000a      relationship between the theological category of communion (the relations\u000d\u000a      between Anglican churches) and the legal category of autonomy (the freedom\u000d\u000a      of individual churches). Doe found that in current global Anglicanism,\u000d\u000a      particularly in conflicts, autonomy prevails over communion, and suggested\u000d\u000a      the Communion should further explore juridical forms to address this3.4.\u000d\u000a      Building on this paper, in 2004 Doe drafted a covenant (which he had\u000d\u000a      proposed in (3.2)) appended to the Windsor Report of the Lambeth\u000d\u000a      Commission (see Section 4). In 2008 Doe's research on the covenant project\u000d\u000a      was published in a book3.5 which proposed that: (a) adoption of\u000d\u000a      a covenant would not represent a revolutionary departure from classical\u000d\u000a      Anglicanism; (b) covenant models in scripture, sacramental theology and\u000d\u000a      those used by comparable global ecclesial communities (e.g. the Lutheran\u000d\u000a      World Federation) could be used as models for an Anglican covenant; and\u000d\u000a      (c) a covenant should seek to clarify the relationship between the\u000d\u000a      theological category of communion with the legal category of autonomy (and\u000d\u000a      its exercise).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3551","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The 1.57 million disabled and older people receiving social care support\u000a      in England and Wales rely heavily on extensive support from 6.5 million\u000a      unpaid carers. Legal reforms since 2008 are removing the disabling\u000a      barriers of legal complexity and ensuring that services for disabled and\u000a      older people as well as their carers focus on the promotion of independent\u000a      living and of `dignity'. Clements' research has helped bring these changes\u000a      about in three ways:\u000a    \u000a      Drafting and amending earlier social care Bills which have informed\u000a        the legislation passed since 2008 and currently under scrutiny;\u000a      Impact on the Law Commission recommendations now included in the Bills\u000a        passing through Parliament and the Welsh Assembly;\u000a      Direct advice given to the Joint Parliamentary Select Committee\u000a        scrutinising the Care and Support Bill 2013.\u000a    \u000a    Pathway to Impact\u000a    Before the REF period Clements was retained by a number of\u000a      Parliamentarians to help draft and amend social care legislation to\u000a      address the unmet needs identified in his research of elderly and disabled\u000a      people and their carers. Commitments included the drafting of Bills which\u000a      became the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995 and the Carers\u000a      (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004. Clements' draft of the latter included an\u000a      attempt to prohibit \"associative discrimination\", which did not survive\u000a      into the Act. In 2006 Clements was retained: as an expert adviser by the\u000a      Disability Rights Commission on the Independent Living Bill 2006, which\u000a      asserted among the guiding principles carers' rights to independent\u000a      living; by Ed Balls MP in drafting the Disabled Children's Assessment and\u000a      Services Bill 2006, which provided for respite care for family carers; and\u000a      by Paul Burstow MP in the drafting of the Care of Older and Incapacitated\u000a      People (Human Rights) Bill 2006 which sought to increase local\u000a      authorities' powers to protect vulnerable people at risk of harm or\u000a      exploitation. In 2007 Clements was retained by Barbara Keeley MP in\u000a      drafting the Carers (Identification and Support) Bill. These interventions\u000a      influenced subsequent legislation within the REF period.\u000a    Law Commission recommendations\u000a    As a direct outcome of Clements' 2007 briefing to the HM Government's\u000a      Office for Disability3.4 - the Law Commission was requested to\u000a      add the reform of Adult Social Care to its list of projects.5.8,5.10\u000a      This resulted in a 2008 scoping report5.1 by the Commission\u000a      that made extensive reference to Clements' research (including the above\u000a      briefing3.4) as did the Commission's 2010 Consultation Paper\u000a      (No 192: Adult Social Care)5.2. These fed into the Commission's\u000a      formal report in 2011 (Adult Social Care: Law Com No 326: HC 941)5.3\u000a      which concluded that the codification and the reform of the law was an\u000a      imperative.\u000a    Clements' research was a leading influence on the Commission's formal\u000a      report.5.8,5.10 For example, the Law Commission recommended\u000a      that the reformed legislation should: commence with a guiding principle\u000a      concerning the promotion of personal well-being (para 4.37); and contain a\u000a      single assessment duty and a single set of eligibility criteria for\u000a      services (paras 5.23 and 6.17): requirements first identified by Clements'\u000a      in his 1997 paper3.2. In addition the report recommended that\u000a      assessment and support for carers should be integral to any proposed Bill\u000a      (para 7.9) and that carers' support needs should be put on the same legal\u000a      footing as those of the people for whom they provide care (para 7.75):\u000a      repeating Clements' 2004 paper3.3. The Law Commission\u000a      recommended that adult protection provisions should be contained within\u000a      the legislation (similar to the proposals in the Care of Older and\u000a      Incapacitated People (Human Rights) Bill 2006 (above) (para 9.51)); and\u000a      that the chilling effects on the `ordinary residence' provisions should be\u000a      addressed (as identified in Clements' HM Government's Office for\u000a      Disability3.4 and in the Social Care Portability Bill (see\u000a      above) (para 10.22). All the above recommendations have now been included\u000a      in the English and Welsh Bills passing through Parliament and the Assembly\u000a      respectively.\u000a    Advice to Joint Parliamentary Select Committee\u000a    Following the Law Commission's call for reform the English Government\u000a      published a draft Bill for scrutiny (the draft Care and Support Bill\u000a      2012). In 2013 Clements was appointed Special Adviser to the Joint\u000a      Parliamentary Select Committee that scrutinised this Bill. Clements'\u000a      `expertise in the law and practice of care and support' was considered to\u000a      be `invaluable' by the Committee and its final Report (March 2013)\u000a      identified approximately 90 matters relating to the draft Bill that\u000a      required attention5.4, for example: the vital importance of\u000a      retaining, unchanged, the legislative boundary of responsibility with the\u000a      NHS (known as the NHS continuing care boundary) (para 11.16); the\u000a      importance of ensuring that the law did not create barriers to disabled\u000a      children continuing to receive services on their transition into adulthood\u000a      (para 11.79); the rights of `young carers' to support from adult services\u000a      (para 11.85); and the maintenance of protection for local authority\u000a      supported residents under the Human Rights Act 1998 (para 11.93). In May\u000a      2013 the English Government introduced the Care Bill which incorporated\u000a      many of these suggested matters 5.9,5.10. The Welsh Government\u000a      had published a similar Bill in January 2013.\u000a    Legislative changes\u000a    Principles drawn from Clements' research and outlined in previous draft\u000a      Bills were enacted after 2008. The provisions within the Disabled\u000a      Children's Assessment and Services Bill 2006 concerning respite care for\u000a      family carers were subsequently enacted (in amended form) as section 25\u000a      Children and Young Persons Act 2008.5.5 Provisions of the\u000a      Carers (Identification and Support) Bill concerning NHS responsibilities\u000a      to provide information for carers became law in the Carers Strategies\u000a      (Wales) Measure 2010. Provisions in the 2004 Carers (Equal Opportunities)\u000a      Bill to amend the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to prohibit\u000a      `associative' discrimination on grounds of disability were finally\u000a      realised in the Equality Act 2010 (section 13). In 2012 Clements was\u000a      retained by Baroness Jane Campbell in the drafting of the Social Care\u000a      Portability Bill 2012, providing for transfer of support between local\u000a      authorities.\u000a    Care Bill 2013 ( England) and Social Services and Well-being\u000a          (Wales) Bill 2013\u000a    Clements' research has impacted in several ways on these two Bills, still\u000a      undergoing scrutiny in the UK Parliament5.6 and Welsh Assembly5.7\u000a      as of July 31st 2013. The `underpinning principles' in clause 1\u000a      of the Independent Living Bill 2006 formed the basis for much of the\u000a      subsequent discussion concerning the need for such provisions and resulted\u000a      in `well-being' proposals in clause 1 of both the English and Welsh 2013\u000a      Bills. The adult protection provisions within the Care of Older and\u000a      Incapacitated People (Human Rights) Bill 2006 have been incorporated in\u000a      part in the Care Bill and to a greater degree in the Welsh Bill (clause\u000a      105). The Social Care Portability Bill's key proposals for transfer of\u000a      local authority support appear in clauses 36 - 37 of the English Bill and\u000a      clause 40 of the Welsh. Both the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act\u000a      1995 and the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 have been incorporated\u000a      in codified form in both the English and Welsh Bills (clauses 19 and 15\u000a      respectively).\u000a    All the Law Commission recommendations based on Clements' research\u000a      (detailed above) appear in both Bills. Specifically: `principle' led\u000a      legislation (clause 1 of each Bill); a single assessment duty (clause 9 in\u000a      England, clause 10 in Wales); a single set of eligibility criteria for\u000a      services (clause 13 in England, clause 19 in Wales); assessment and\u000a      support for carers placed on the same legal footing as those of the people\u000a      for whom they provide care (clauses 10 and 18 in England, clauses 10 and\u000a      26 in Wales); adult protection provisions (clause 42 in England, clause\u000a      105 in Wales); and the portability of care packages (clause 36\/37 in\u000a      England, clause 40 in Wales).\u000a    The English Care Bill included many of the suggestions made by the Joint\u000a      Select Committee on Clements' advice. Specifically: retaining the\u000a      legislative boundary of responsibility with the NHS (clause 22); the\u000a      importance of ensuring that the law does not create barriers to disabled\u000a      children continuing to receive services on transition into adulthood\u000a      (clause 55); the rights of `young carers' to support from adult services\u000a      (clause 60); and the maintenance of protection for local authority\u000a      supported residents under the Human Rights Act 1998 (to be dealt with by\u000a      way of a consequential amendment - Hansard House of Lords 22 July 2013 :\u000a      Column 1118, Baroness Northover).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The law regulating social care services for disabled and elderly adults,\u000a      and their carers, had been unreformed for over 60 years. Reform had been\u000a      inhibited by the law's complexity, the rapid growth in community\u000a      dependency (due to deinstitutionalisation and the growth in the numbers of\u000a      elderly people) and the lack of political consensus on the direction\u000a      reform should take. Fundamental demographic and societal change over the\u000a      last 20 years has made the failure of the legislation to address the\u000a      support needs of unpaid carers and those for whom they care an even more\u000a      pressing issue. As a result of a sustained period of research, academic\u000a      publication and Parliamentary action by Clements, this area of law is now\u000a      being reformed. Both the Westminster Parliament and the National Assembly\u000a      in Wales have been scrutinising Public Bills (the Care Bill 2013 in\u000a      England and, in Wales, the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Bill\u000a      2013). Despite significant social policy research on this fundamental\u000a      issue, Clements was almost alone in highlighting the legal dimensions. He\u000a      thereby made a major contribution to public discourse on this question and\u000a      played a key role in bringing about legal change.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Cardiff University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Cardiff University","InstitutionName":"Cardiff University","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Wales","UKPRN":10007814}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

In 1996 Clements carried out\u000a      research, published as a book3.1, which identified a range of\u000a      Acts that collectively regulated the provision of social care support to\u000a      disabled and older people, and their unpaid carers. It critically analysed\u000a      the `contradictions and inconsistencies' in the legislation and called for\u000a      fundamental reform of the law. In 1997 in an article3.2,\u000a      Clements identified the essential elements of any reformed legislation and\u000a      in a further paper3.3 in 2004 he highlighted the social\u000a      exclusion experienced by large numbers of carers as a manifestation of the\u000a      social model of disability: essentially carers being disabled `by\u000a      association'.\u000a    In 2007, at the invitation of HM Government's Office for Disability,\u000a      Clements briefed a private seminar on the need for law reform of adult\u000a      social care law. His paper3.4 pointed to the very complexity of\u000a      the law as a disabling barrier to accessing the rights of those in need.\u000a      He also drew attention to the problems created by the absence of any\u000a      underpinning principles as to eligibility for social care support\u000a      services. In a major updated publication in 20073.5 Clements\u000a      took stock of his research in this field. He pointed to the decline in the\u000a      number of people being supported by council services (despite a\u000a      significant increase in community dependency) and to the significant\u000a      increase in the number of women in paid employment. He then drew attention\u000a      to how these factors had resulted in an increase in the number of unpaid\u000a      family carers (to over 6 million) the highest proportion of whom were\u000a      women in work. In 2008 in an article3.6 Clements critically\u000a      analysed the reform option being proposed by the English Government for\u000a      this branch of the law which involves commodifying a person's social care\u000a      needs into a `personal budget' which they then use to purchase support\u000a      services.

The Commission's report (later reviewed by Lee and Stokes) cited\u000d\u000a      the \"regulatory gap\" analysis developed at Cardiff 5.1 and\u000d\u000a      repeated the call for adapting and extending the existing regulatory\u000d\u000a      framework \"as a matter of urgency\". The House of Lords' Science and\u000d\u000a      Technology Committee's study on Nanotechnologies and Food (January 2010)\u000d\u000a      quoted the team's written evidence based on the DTI report: \"Even if the\u000d\u000a      current regulatory regime is capable of addressing the current\u000d\u000a      applications of nanotechnologies and nanomaterials in the food sector,\u000d\u000a      some witnesses questioned whether this would remain the case as the\u000d\u000a      science and applications of nanotechnologies and nanomaterials developed.\u000d\u000a      The BRASS team, for example, anticipated that `gaps in current legislation\u000d\u000a      will only grow to be more pronounced...current regulation will, in our\u000d\u000a      opinion, need to be amended to account for more sophisticated nano-based\u000d\u000a      products and processes.'\"5.2. Two months later the Government\u000d\u000a      published its Nanotechnologies Strategy5.3 and stated: \"The\u000d\u000a      [Cardiff] research concluded that while many areas had strong regulatory\u000d\u000a      cover, some gaps existed. Departments and Agencies within Government are\u000d\u000a      working to ensure that regulations and policies in all sectors are applied\u000d\u000a      appropriately to nanomaterials and that the issues identified by BRASS are\u000d\u000a      addressed.\" The strategy sets out actions in four areas where\u000d\u000a      nanotechnology is most likely to affect the environment or health: food,\u000d\u000a      cosmetics, healthcare and the workplace.\u000d\u000a    A new Publicly Available Specification from the British Standards\u000d\u000a          Institution\u000d\u000a    Team research - notably the regulatory gaps identified in the DTI report\u000d\u000a      and concerns about CSR in nanotech companies analysed in the Defra report\u000d\u000a      had impact on the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and\u000d\u000a      the BSI. The research influenced the BIS decision to commission a BSI PAS\u000d\u000a      (137 on Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology), which the team was contracted\u000d\u000a      to write (reflecting its strong profile with industry and good reputation\u000d\u000a      in government). As well as drawing on several years of research undertaken\u000d\u000a      by the team (including the DTI and Defra reports), the drafting of the\u000d\u000a      Specification (commissioned in 2009) involved close engagement with a\u000d\u000a      Steering Group composed of key representatives of industry and government5.5.\u000d\u000a      The team's work on the PAS constituted an important element of central\u000d\u000a      government's developing strategy for the regulation of nanotechnology. The\u000d\u000a      Specification aims to overcome problems identified by the team, such as\u000d\u000a      the lack of nanotechnology-specific regulatory measures and the potential\u000d\u000a      health and environmental consequences of nanomaterials. PAS 137 has been\u000d\u000a      designed as the reference point for the whole of British industry,\u000d\u000a      signposting regulation and standards relevant to researching,\u000d\u000a      manufacturing, marketing, managing and distributing nanomaterials at all\u000d\u000a      stages of industrial development. Lee, Stokes, Vaughan and Groves made up\u000d\u000a      the group funded to create PAS 137 which was written between 2009 and 2013\u000d\u000a      (and published in October 2013)5.5.\u000d\u000a    Rejection of a nanotechnology moratorium\u000d\u000a    Non-governmental organisations (e.g. Friends of the Earth, Action Group\u000d\u000a      on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) called for a moratorium on\u000d\u000a      nanotechnology development and use until the risks could be more\u000d\u000a      accurately assessed. Research by the Cardiff team, including Stokes' 2009\u000d\u000a      paper3.4, concluded a moratorium would incur high\u000d\u000a      administrative and compliance costs and would have an inhibitive effect on\u000d\u000a      innovation. This research underpinned a briefing to policy-makers helping\u000d\u000a      to shape a 2009 UK Government statement on nanotechnology: \"The Government\u000d\u000a      agrees with...the Economic and Social Research Centre for Business\u000d\u000a      Relationships, Accountability, Sustainability and Society that a\u000d\u000a      moratorium on the marketing of nanotechnologies would not be an\u000d\u000a      appropriate response.\"5.4\u000d\u000a    Impact on industry and the wider public\u000d\u000a    As a direct result of the DTI report, Lee became an invited member of\u000d\u000a      Defra's Social and Economic Dimensions of Nanotechnologies Task Force, its\u000d\u000a      overarching body - the Nanotechnology Research Coordination Group (which\u000d\u000a      met until the end of 2009) and the Research Councils United Kingdom\u000d\u000a      Nanoscience Strategic Advisory Team. These groups set research objectives\u000d\u000a      on behalf of government departments, regulatory agencies and research\u000d\u000a      councils, helping to shape the research agendas and horizon-scanning\u000d\u000a      activities of industry practitioners, scientists and research councils\u000d\u000a      responsible for the research and development of novel technologies5.7.\u000d\u000a    Research has also contributed to the development of public information\u000d\u000a      resources. Stokes compiled pages about the regulation system for the Nano\u000d\u000a      &amp; Me (www.nanoandme.org)\u000d\u000a      website funded by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS),\u000d\u000a      described by Professor Andrew Maynard (science and technology blogger at\u000d\u000a      2020science.org), as `quite possibly the best one- stop-shop for down to\u000d\u000a      earth information on nanotech around' and by the Nanotechnology\u000d\u000a      Stakeholder Forum as \"a good platform from which to engage stakeholders\u000d\u000a      including the public, consumers and industry\". Lee and Stokes wrote a\u000d\u000a      section on regulation for the UK Environmental Law Association's website\u000d\u000a      \"Law and Your Environment\" (for advice agencies and citizens) which gets\u000d\u000a      30,000 monthly visits.\u000d\u000a    International impact\u000d\u000a    The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\u000d\u000a      recommended the DTI report to its Working Party on Manufactured\u000d\u000a      Nanomaterials (WPMN - particularly Steering Group 5 on regulatory\u000d\u000a      measures). WPMN held six meetings (meeting numbers 3 to 8) between 2008\u000d\u000a      and 2011. In so doing OECD identified the DTI report's relevance beyond\u000d\u000a      the UK: \"The [DTI] report finds that in the interim, the existing\u000d\u000a      framework can be adapted generally by ensuring that where appropriate the\u000d\u000a      regulation extends to nanomaterials. In this context the work of\u000d\u000a      international standard setting bodies is crucial in resolving issues of\u000d\u000a      definition and taxonomy, allowing effective standard setting in relation\u000d\u000a      to nanoparticles and opening up the prospects of a uniform global response\u000d\u000a      to the marketing and circulation of nanomaterials.\"5.8\u000d\u000a    In 2009 the team submitted written evidence on regulation and engagement\u000d\u000a      to the EU Consultation on a Strategic Nanotechnology Action Plan. In the\u000d\u000a      same year, in Canada, the Regulatory Governance Initiative noted that \"an\u000d\u000a      interesting aspect of the Cardiff report was their approach of examining a\u000d\u000a      lifecycle approach to the regulation of nanomaterials\"5.9. The\u000d\u000a      German Federal Institute for Occupational Health and Safety cited the DTI\u000d\u000a      report as contributing to the \"statutory background\" to its research\u000d\u000a      strategy5.10 (which identified urgent priorities implemented\u000d\u000a      between 2008 and 2010).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Nanotechnology is one of the world's fastest developing industrial\u000d\u000a      sectors; as well as the economic significance of nanomaterials, they have\u000d\u000a      potentially serious implications for health and the environment.

The report's key conclusions were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Existing regulations were not specific enough to control applications\u000d\u000a        of nanotechnology over their lifecycle;\u000d\u000a      Gaps in the regulations occurred because of ill-suited regulatory\u000d\u000a        provisions and a lack of information about the health \/ environmental\u000d\u000a        effects of applications of nanotechnology;\u000d\u000a      While new regulatory structures were needed in the long-term, in the\u000d\u000a        interim the existing regulatory framework could be supplemented (with\u000d\u000a        new guidance, standards), amended and extended to apply to\u000d\u000a        nanotechnology.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In 2009 the team, augmented by Vaughan3.3 (Associate Lecturer,\u000d\u000a      2008-2010; Lecturer, 2010- 2012) and three BRASS social scientists\u000d\u000a      including Groves (Research Associate 2008- ), undertook research for Defra3.4,3.5,\u000d\u000a      including quantitative content analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility\u000d\u000a      (CSR) reporting by UK nanotechnology companies, and in-depth interviews on\u000d\u000a      industry attitudes to nanotechnology stakeholder issues. This research\u000d\u000a      found little or no CSR reporting among smaller companies, little evidence\u000d\u000a      of a `continuous improvement' model of CSR in companies of any size, a\u000d\u000a      general preference for `do no harm' over `adding positive social value'\u000d\u000a      approaches, and support among industry stakeholders for soft (rather than\u000d\u000a      legislative) forms of regulation, such as further guidance documents and\u000d\u000a      standards dealing specific with nanotechnology. The Cardiff research\u000d\u000a      suggested that the CSR agenda might assist in promoting responsible\u000d\u000a      innovation through voluntary and self-regulation in nanotechnology\u000d\u000a      research and development.\u000d\u000a    From the mid-2000s pressure groups such as Friends of the Earth began to\u000d\u000a      call for a moratorium on nanotechnology development. Team research\u000d\u000a      published in 2009 analysed the costs and benefits of different regulatory\u000d\u000a      strategies and consequently questioned the viability of a moratorium\u000d\u000a      approach 3.6.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3695","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research described in section 2 was the basis for a set of arguments\u000d\u000a      to reshape penal policy in\u000d\u000a      directions that were less expansionist and were informed by a desire to\u000d\u000a      find constructive\u000d\u000a      alternatives to imprisonment, such as justice reinvestment. Loader's\u000d\u000a      research had a direct and\u000d\u000a      significant impact by influencing the thinking and recommendations of the\u000d\u000a      Commission on English\u000d\u000a      Prisons Today, a two-year inquiry established in 2009 by the Howard League\u000d\u000a      for Penal Reform, the\u000d\u000a      UK's leading penal reform charity. The research was used by the Howard\u000d\u000a      League to develop an\u000d\u000a      alternative vision of penal change, and a coherent and overarching account\u000d\u000a      of what it stood for, that\u000d\u000a      in turn informed its campaigning work. It also influenced the thinking of\u000d\u000a      other NGOs and of leading\u000d\u000a      policy makers.\u000d\u000a    Loader was a member of the Commission. In this capacity he was invited to\u000d\u000a      write two briefing\u000d\u000a      papers, based upon his research, to be considered as evidence. The\u000d\u000a      relevant papers are: i)\u000d\u000a      `Principles of the Penal System' and ii) `Why Penal Moderation?' [see\u000d\u000a        Section 5: C1]. Loader's\u000d\u000a      evidence was key to the Commission and to the Howard League more\u000d\u000a      generally. The charity said\u000d\u000a      that, `Professor Loader's contribution to the Commission was central and\u000d\u000a      essential as he provided\u000d\u000a      expert advice and guidance throughout its proceedings which influenced the\u000d\u000a      questions considered\u000d\u000a      and recommendations. The central focus of the Commission was that of penal\u000d\u000a      moderation which\u000d\u000a      was brought by Professor Loader': his research [R2] on this topic\u000d\u000a      proved absolutely `seminal'. [C3]\u000d\u000a    Part III of the Commission's report [C2, especially pp. 31-36] is\u000d\u000a      organized around the idea of `penal\u000d\u000a      moderation' as developed in Loader's research. [R2], [R3]\u000d\u000a      The Commission describes this idea as\u000d\u000a      the `intellectual foundation' (p. 31) of its recommendations and directly\u000d\u000a      endorses Loader's account\u000d\u000a      of its three key elements &#8212; restraint, parsimony and human dignity (pp.\u000d\u000a      32-34). The Report contains\u000d\u000a      further positive references to Loader's research and extended quotations\u000d\u000a      from his papers [C2, C3].\u000d\u000a    By this route, Loader's research directly shaped a report which now\u000d\u000a      provides the framework guiding\u000d\u000a      the Howard League's campaigning work. It was also influential in the\u000d\u000a      thinking of others, including\u000d\u000a      Make Justice Work, a group that includes former prisoner governors and\u000d\u000a      charity directors and that\u000d\u000a      lobbies for change in how Britain deals with minor offenders. Its founder\u000d\u000a      said, `Research\u000d\u000a      conducted by Professor Ian Loader has helped to underpin much of the\u000d\u000a      deeper knowledge that is\u000d\u000a      necessary to run a campaign such as Make Justice Work, particularly work\u000d\u000a      he has undertaken\u000d\u000a      around community sentences and short term prison sentences.'[C4]\u000d\u000a    Beyond such groups, the research had a further indirect impact upon penal\u000d\u000a      policy debates [C5].\u000d\u000a      Loader disseminated the key findings of the Commission Report among senior\u000d\u000a      managers in the\u000d\u000a      prison service. He was invited to deliver one of the Annual Perrie\u000d\u000a      Lectures to an audience of 200\u000d\u000a      senior prison staff at the Prison Service Training College in July 2009.\u000d\u000a      The Lecture was\u000d\u000a      subsequently published in the Prison Service Journal &#8212; the main in-house\u000d\u000a      journal read by senior\u000d\u000a      prison staff [C6]. The Commission Report also became influential\u000d\u000a      on the criminal justice agenda of\u000d\u000a      the Conservative Party, then in opposition, partly through its\u000d\u000a      dissemination to MPs [C5] and partly\u000d\u000a      through a much-discussed blog entry by Loader, based on the Commission\u000d\u000a      Report, on the high\u000d\u000a      profile Conservative Party website, Conservative Home [C7].\u000d\u000a    By these and other routes, Loader's research went on to shape debate in\u000d\u000a      Parliament and the views\u000d\u000a      of various MPs working in the field of penal policy [C3, C5]. Its\u000d\u000a      influence may be seen in the Home\u000d\u000a      Office Select Committee's Inquiry into Justice Reinvestment, to which\u000d\u000a      Loader was invited to give\u000d\u000a      oral evidence on 25th November 2008. He was invited based on\u000d\u000a      his research on the changing\u000d\u000a      governance\/politicization of crime, and gave evidence drawing on that\u000d\u000a      research[R1, R2]. The\u000d\u000a      Committee's criticisms of the politicization of criminal justice policy\u000d\u000a      and on its views on how to\u000d\u000a      create a political consensus for alternative measures such as justice\u000d\u000a      reinvestment follow Loader's\u000d\u000a      arguments in many respects. Seventeen approving references to Professor\u000d\u000a      Loader's evidence can\u000d\u000a      be found in the final report of the Justice Committee [C8], and on\u000d\u000a      nine occasions the Committee\u000d\u000a      quotes verbatim from Loader's evidence. `Loader's research shaped the\u000d\u000a      views of the Committee\u000d\u000a      on how to build a political consensus for alternatives to imprisonment...\u000d\u000a      His publications have\u000d\u000a      considerable impact and are frequently cited by individuals and bodies\u000d\u000a      which are key players in the\u000d\u000a      development of public policy.'[C5]\u000d\u000a    Loader's research thus shaped public debate about a central issue of\u000d\u000a      public policy in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales. His findings and ideas influenced leading NGOs, opinion in\u000d\u000a      parliament and in a political\u000d\u000a      party, and by uptake of senior managers in the prison service, also major\u000d\u000a      stakeholders in the penal\u000d\u000a      system. The ideas of penal moderation and of `justice reinvestment' in\u000d\u000a      local communities became\u000d\u000a      distinctive themes in the national argument about criminal justice. As one\u000d\u000a      key player put it, `The\u000d\u000a      argument, posited so cogently by Professor Loader, that penal excess was\u000d\u000a      expensive in terms of\u000d\u000a      individual lives and public expenditure, gained traction with politicians,\u000d\u000a      particularly now that we are\u000d\u000a      in times of financial austerity. It is an argument that will resonate for\u000d\u000a      many years to come.'[C3]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Ian Loader's research on the concept of `penal moderation'\u000d\u000a      shaped the final report of the\u000d\u000a      Commission on English Prisons Today and helped to inform the policy\u000d\u000a      arguments of the UK's\u000d\u000a      leading penal reform charity &#8212; the Howard League for Penal Reform.

Loader\u000d\u000a      undertook elite interviews\u000d\u000a      with retired senior government officials and found that what one of his\u000d\u000a      subjects called a `Platonic\u000d\u000a      guardianship' mode of governance was increasingly questioned, its key\u000d\u000a      assumptions challenged,\u000d\u000a      and much of its architecture dismantled. The research describes the\u000d\u000a      underlying cultural changes\u000d\u000a      that drove these changes, notably the rise of mass media and a decline of\u000d\u000a      deference towards\u000d\u000a      authority. It also offers an explanation of the dynamics of key moments of\u000d\u000a      transition, the first\u000d\u000a      following the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979, and the second\u000d\u000a      following the murder of James\u000d\u000a      Bulger in 1993. The research discloses transformations in what key actors\u000d\u000a      regard as `political\u000d\u000a      responsibility' in the field of crime and punishment, and sets out\u000d\u000a      sociologically tenable choices that\u000d\u000a      can be made in penal policy today. This is a longstanding research\u000d\u000a      programme, the key output of\u000d\u000a      which [see Section 3: R1] was written and published following\u000d\u000a      Loader's arrival in Oxford in July\u000d\u000a      2005.\u000d\u000a    The second strand of research develops and deploys the concepts of\u000d\u000a      `excess' and `moderation' to\u000d\u000a      advance sociological and normative understanding of the political and\u000d\u000a      cultural dynamics of crime\u000d\u000a      control. In the former case the research seeks to highlight the ways in\u000d\u000a      which contemporary political\u000d\u000a      responses to crime in England and Wales have tried to satisfy an appetite\u000d\u000a      for security and\u000d\u000a      punishment which, when couched in terms of excess and moderation, may in\u000d\u000a      fact be insatiable\u000d\u000a      [R2]. In the latter case, the research teases out the meanings that\u000d\u000a      moderation might have when\u000d\u000a      applied to the penal realm (the key elements being restraint, parsimony\u000d\u000a      and dignity) and seeks to\u000d\u000a      articulate the cultural purchase of these ideas in the context of\u000d\u000a      prevailing sensibilities. The\u000d\u000a      overriding objective of Loader's research has been to develop a coherent\u000d\u000a      public philosophy of\u000d\u000a      punishment &#8212; one rooted in sound principles (of dignity and restraint) &#8212;\u000d\u000a      that also seeks to connect\u000d\u000a      with structures of public sentiment in English society [R3]. It\u000d\u000a      then uses this conceptual framework\u000d\u000a      to build the case for alternative penal practices, including as `justice\u000d\u000a      reinvestment', the idea that\u000d\u000a      savings realised from reducing incarceration can be invested into the\u000d\u000a      community to help prevent\u000d\u000a      crime.

Pawlowski's research and interventions have\u000d\u000a      helped the judiciary and practising legal profession to catch up on\u000d\u000a      important changes, and influenced reform of law and legal policy to meet\u000d\u000a      the changed circumstances.\u000d\u000a    Impact 1: Change in practice regarding mutual wills\u000d\u000a    Mutual wills are used by couples to determine what happens to their home\u000d\u000a      after they both die. If they are not advised that the wills cannot be\u000d\u000a      enforced, they can neither guarantee that their wishes will be respected\u000d\u000a      by the other if they die first, or protect the beneficiary from challenge.\u000d\u000a      The research found that mutual wills are not popular but when used, the\u000d\u000a      potential for problems is significant. The findings were disseminated to\u000d\u000a      those solicitors who participated in the project: positive feedback was\u000d\u000a      returned, indicating a new awareness of the Healey decision and\u000d\u000a      the importance of using a separate contractual document signed by both\u000d\u000a      parties complying with the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions)Act\u000d\u000a      1925. This has avoided the potential for mutual wills to be declared void\u000d\u000a      by the courts for lack of legal formality.\u000d\u000a    Impact 2: Change in advice given to clients purchasing a house in\u000d\u000a        joint names\u000d\u000a    People who buy a home in joint names and then need to sell and split the\u000d\u000a      proceeds, face financial disappointment if the law regards their share as\u000d\u000a      less than they expect. But this is exactly what has been happening.\u000d\u000a      Pawlowski and Brown were able to provide valuable recommendations on the\u000d\u000a      importance of using express declarations of trust, and of making clients\u000d\u000a      aware that the amount they contribute to mortgage repayments, and invest\u000d\u000a      in capital improvements, can affect their share, despite the presumption\u000d\u000a      of equality and the terms of a declaration of trust. In feedback, a\u000d\u000a      significant number of solicitors indicated a change in the advice given to\u000d\u000a      clients. The research has also added to pressure to reform Land Registry\u000d\u000a      practice, making completion of the \"declaration of trust\" (Panel 10) in\u000d\u000a      the TR1\/FR1\/TP1 form mandatory. The Law Society and Land Registry issued a\u000d\u000a      joint practice note in January 2013 on joint ownership and the\u000d\u000a      desirability of recording owners' intentions at the time of purchase using\u000d\u000a      a declaration of trust.\u000d\u000a    Impact 3: Informed and stimulated judicial debate\u000d\u000a    The case commentary on \"Tenant Abandonment - Damages for Loss of Future\u000d\u000a      Rent\" in the Law Quarterly Review [3.6] was a highly critical\u000d\u000a      piece on an important Court of Appeal ruling in Reichman v Beveridge\u000d\u000a      (2006), identifying a number of English cases not cited to the Court and\u000d\u000a      suggesting that, if they had, a different conclusion on the law may have\u000d\u000a      been reached. Its impact on the legal community is evidenced by a response\u000d\u000a      from one of the Lord Justices of Appeal involved, stating that he was\u000d\u000a      \"very interested to find that there were English cases on the point that\u000d\u000a      were not cited to us\" and suggesting that the Court may have reached a\u000d\u000a      different conclusion had it been aware of them.\u000d\u000a    Impact 4: Promoted awareness of landlord and tenant, land law and\u000d\u000a        trusts within the legal profession\u000d\u000a    Pawlowski's publications are regularly cited on leading online research\u000d\u000a      tools.

Pawlowski has uncovered many areas of\u000d\u000a      law relating to land, property and landlord and tenant, where change has\u000d\u000a      gone unnoticed.\u000d\u000a    For example, Pawlowski and Brown's research [3.4] on mutual wills\u000d\u000a      examined the implications of the current law and, in particular, the\u000d\u000a      decision in Healey v Brown [2002] WTLR 849, that where the subject\u000d\u000a      of the mutual wills is land and property, the will is not enough; there\u000d\u000a      needs to be a separate contractual document. The research looked at the\u000d\u000a      current use of such wills, identifying the reasons for their unpopularity\u000d\u000a      and highlighting the practical consequences of ignoring the Healey\u000d\u000a      ruling. A questionnaire was sent to a sample of 200 probate solicitors\u000d\u000a      throughout England and Wales in 2011, selected from senior probate\u000d\u000a      practitioners found on the Law Society website, grouped evenly amongst\u000d\u000a      five different regions in the UK. The research revealed the absence of any\u000d\u000a      reference to the Healey decision in 81 per cent of responses, and\u000d\u000a      therefore the likelihood that practitioners are not aware of the decision\u000d\u000a      and, in particular, the importance of complying with the Law of Property\u000d\u000a      (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 when drafting mutual wills which refer\u000d\u000a      specifically to land.\u000d\u000a    A second study [3.5] by Pawlowski and Brown involved empirical research\u000d\u000a      into the consequences of applying the \"presumption of equality\" in joint\u000d\u000a      ownership cases and whether an express declaration of trust is conclusive\u000d\u000a      of the parties' beneficial shares in the family home. A questionnaire was\u000d\u000a      sent to 200 conveyancing solicitors throughout England and Wales in 2012.\u000d\u000a      The research revealed that a high proportion of clients (33 per cent) were\u000d\u000a      not informed that the presumption of equality will apply regardless of the\u000d\u000a      actual proportions in which they have contributed to the purchase price\u000d\u000a      unless they make an express declaration of trust. Moreover, 48 per cent of\u000d\u000a      clients were not made aware of the potential for enlarging their notional\u000d\u000a      shares by virtue of post-acquisition improvements to the property or\u000d\u000a      subsequent (significant) contributions to mortgage instalments,\u000d\u000a      irrespective of whether they have a declaration of trust.\u000d\u000a    Pawlowski made a detailed study [3.6] of the Court of Appeal decision in\u000d\u000a      Reichman v Beveridge [2006] EWCA Civ 1659. The decision rejected\u000d\u000a      the notion that a landlord has a contractual right to terminate a tenancy\u000d\u000a      for repudiatory breach and to claim \"loss of bargain\" damages based on a\u000d\u000a      tenant's fundamental breach. The research found that the decision may have\u000d\u000a      been flawed, given that a number of English decisions were not cited to\u000d\u000a      the Court at the hearing, and that the recovery of loss of bargain damages\u000d\u000a      in the leasehold context is not so out of step with English law principles\u000d\u000a      as to justify its rejection out of hand.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3905","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Angela Laycock's premise that to be effective legal practitioners must\u000d\u000a      have an understanding of the law's social and political context, its\u000d\u000a      effect on individuals and its weaknesses has led to the development of\u000d\u000a      both a new teaching methodology and research approach which can develop\u000d\u000a      solutions to inadequate legislation and practice in many legal fields.

Early findings, which suggest substantial\u000d\u000a      improvement in academic performance, have been disseminated to the legal\u000d\u000a      education community [3.4] and presented at two peer reviewed\u000d\u000a      conferences at Oxford (2012) and Cambridge universities (2011).

As a member of the Dfid Pass Harmonisation of African\u000d\u000a      Phytosanitary Legislation project (2003) she began the development of a\u000d\u000a      methodology for monitoring biosecurity law, which she further developed\u000d\u000a      with Black and Outhwaite [3.3] in response to the Nuffield Foundation\u000d\u000a      (April 2004) Inquiry on Empirical Research in Law's identification\u000d\u000a      of a \"lack of capacity to undertake empirical research within the field of\u000d\u000a      law\".\u000d\u000a    Laycock`s main research into the training of empirical legal researchers,\u000d\u000a      however, has been in Human Rights Law, a new field in UK Law as a result\u000d\u000a      of the Human Rights Act 1998. She devised a research-oriented methodology\u000d\u000a      suitable for traditional undergraduate class sizes, which has influenced\u000d\u000a      the teaching of human rights in her own and other law schools [3.2]. It\u000d\u000a      is, however, her work in incorporating research-based learning into the\u000d\u000a      undergraduate curriculum which has led to Greenwich's involvement in\u000d\u000a      international and local community projects which have facilitated the\u000d\u000a      monitoring of disability law and promoted a human rights model of\u000d\u000a      disability [3.1].\u000d\u000a    Laycock's opportunity to trial the new teaching methodology came with UN\u000d\u000a      Resolution 2000\/51 \"to examine measures to strengthen the protection and\u000d\u000a      monitoring of human rights of persons with disability\" and Disability\u000d\u000a      Rights Promotion International's project, Building a human rights\u000d\u000a        monitoring system in the field of disability. Laycock with David\u000d\u000a      Yarrow of Osgoode Hall, Toronto, piloted the first DRPI Legal Education\u000d\u000a      and Research Project (2003-7) linking Law Schools, firstly, to collect\u000d\u000a      data on the effectiveness of legislation in promoting the rights of\u000d\u000a      disabled people in the UK and North America respectively, and secondly, to\u000d\u000a      provide Law students with the skills to work as part of a research project\u000d\u000a      team through practical experience. The expertise gained in disability law\u000d\u000a      led to three local community projects (2008-13) including the Pro Bono\u000d\u000a      Vulnerable Witness Project.\u000d\u000a    Strategies for student engagement in the undergraduate curriculum\u000d\u000a      Carol Withey's research is underpinned by the desire to encourage student\u000d\u000a      engagement with all facets of a law course. She developed a feedback guide\u000d\u000a      for law students and a process to ensure student participation in\u000d\u000a      feedback, where students assess their work against learning outcomes,\u000d\u000a      compare the teacher's comments with their own, and estimate their grade\u000d\u000a      before they receive it. The `feed-forwarding' task gets course points\u000d\u000a      [3.4].\u000d\u000a    Withey has developed a unique visual aid to legal teaching, using\u000d\u000a      animated \"Lego\" characters to illustrate key principles in criminal law. A\u000d\u000a      series of Lego Law films for use by law schools has since been produced.\u000d\u000a    She has added to the body of research in the use of electronic voting\u000d\u000a      systems (EVS) through her pioneering use of mobile technology\u000d\u000a      (PollEverywhere) as opposed to the normal system of hand- held clickers.\u000d\u000a      Withey used both systems during lectures and then researched student\u000d\u000a      preferences and the pedagogical value of using EVS in teaching.

Through regular meetings, the Committee considers the potential\u000a      impact and quality of research proposals. It only selects those that are\u000a      likely to have the most impact on the sector and are aligned with the\u000a      clear goal of increasing the effectiveness of the charity sector through\u000a      the research findings.\u000a    The impact has manifested itself in two direct ways:\u000a    First, the work has directly led to an improved legislative framework\u000a        for the charity sector through the introduction of new legislation\u000a      governing charity mergers and the establishment of a new legal structure\u000a      for charities. The findings and recommendations of our report on charity\u000a      mergers are embedded in the Charities Act 2011, Part 16. It creates for\u000a      the first time a register of charity mergers to enhance and manage assets\u000a      on merger and provides a statutory definition of `relevant mergers' to\u000a      help manage the process. Our recommendations to conduct due diligence\u000a      before engaging with the new statutory framework have been adopted in\u000a      sector guidance publications, which are referred to frequently. Mergers of\u000a      organisations have increased as part of a wider drive to provide an\u000a      effective charity sector, facilitated by the reformed process. Consequently,\u000a        over 1,200 registered mergers of charities have now been completed.\u000a    Our work on legal structures has directly fed into the development of a\u000a      new structure that meets the needs of charities. This is implemented in\u000a      the new Charitable Incorporated Organisation (by virtue of the Charities\u000a      Act 2011, Part 11). Creating the first legal structure designed\u000a      specifically for charities has been a complex and lengthy process. It was\u000a      only in January 2013 that the structure was made available on a limited\u000a      basis to charities in England and Wales. It has already attracted\u000a      substantial interest. By September 5th 2013, over\u000a        1,000 charities had adopted this structure nationwide.\u000a    Secondly, the work has significantly enhanced the policy and practice\u000a        underpinning the effective operation of the charity sector.\u000a      Principal Judge McKenna commended our work on the operation of the nascent\u000a      Charity Tribunal in a lecture and she chose to post the relevant work on\u000a      the Charity\u000a        Tribunal's website following publication. This publication was also\u000a      a key resource considered by the National Council for Voluntary\u000a      Organisations Charity Law Review Advisory Group, Sub-committee on Means of\u000a      Redress. They agreed in their final report with our recommendations that\u000a      current deficiencies must be remedied, otherwise the value of the Tribunal\u000a      system as a cost effective and informal alternative means of settling\u000a      disputes will be lost. These recommendations fed directly into the Hodgson\u000a      Report. The government response to the Hodgson Report suggests that\u000a      further research is needed into these live issues of reform and the Law\u000a      Commission is now taking this forward. The Law Commission in England and\u000a      Wales has approached Barr and Morris to work towards shaping their current\u000a      programme of charity law reform (which also includes further work on\u000a      charity mergers).\u000a    The disputes work, that highlighted the importance and need for increased\u000a      uptake of Alternative Dispute Resolution, has been specifically adopted by\u000a      the sector regulator, the Charity Commission, in its guidance documents.\u000a      Our report has also directly informed another recommendation in the\u000a      Hodgson report that charities should adopt and publish procedures for\u000a      handling complaints and that umbrella bodies should play a key role in\u000a      supporting their implementation. The government has now accepted the\u000a      recommendation and the Charity Commission is now working more closely with\u000a      umbrella bodies within the charitable sector.\u000a    Alongside the key impacts identified, research outputs have impacted in\u000a      other ways to benefit the charitable sector. For example, the Charity\u000a      Commission adopted the recommendations from our mergers research as a\u000a      vital element in its mergers toolkit. Similarly, the analysis of\u000a      employment disputes in the charity disputes project is shaping other\u000a      research agendas. For example, the legal status of volunteers within the\u000a      charity sector (recognised by us as a source of dispute) is a live issue,\u000a      having recently been adjudicated upon in the Supreme Court in the case of\u000a      X v Mid Sussex Citizens Advice Bureau [2012] UKSC 59.\u000a    The high profile of the Unit's work has attracted the attention of policy\u000a      makers, regulators and lawyers undertaking reform outside the UK. In\u000a      addition to the reform work with the Law Commission in England and Wales,\u000a      Morris was invited to advise on proposed reform to public benefit rules in\u000a      Australia (2009), and on the reform of Iocal charity legislation in Israel\u000a      (2011).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Charity Law and Policy Unit (part of Liverpool University Law School)\u000a      has a Steering Committee which advises on research strategy.

Research that has directly led to an improved legislative framework\u000a        for the charity sector\u000a    a. Mergers (see references 1 and 2 below)\u000a    Charities have been under increasing pressure to merge to more\u000a      effectively pursue their objectives, but the legal process to support\u000a      merger was not conducive to them doing so. Our research conducted between\u000a      1999-2002 into charity mergers uncovered a number of major problems,\u000a      including:\u000a    \u000a      Employment rights for employees of a merged charity can be\u000a        compromised.\u000a      Processes required for legal merger were complex and lengthy.\u000a      Transfer of assets to the merged charities was difficult and may not\u000a        have been possible.\u000a      Mergers failed because of lack of due diligence.\u000a    \u000a    It was concluded that these challenges could best be met by the\u000a      introduction of new legal mechanisms for merger. These recommendations\u000a      were adopted in legislation, evident in the Charities Act 2011, Part 16\u000a      (ss.305-311).\u000a    b. Creation of a Bespoke Legal Structure for Charities (see reference 3\u000a      below)\u000a    Charities in the past have had to adopt one of three legal structures. A\u000a      major publication, building on ideas that had been presented by members of\u000a      the Unit since 1999, found that none of the legal structures effectively\u000a      recognised the non-profit status of charities. Particular problems of the\u000a      existing structures were:\u000a    \u000a      Managing trustees might be exposed to personal liability for the\u000a        organisation's legal dealings.\u000a      Potential conflicts between the varied needs and reporting demands of\u000a        dual regulators and an increased burden of bureaucracy. For example, a\u000a        charitable company would be subject to registration and regulation by\u000a        both Companies House and the Charity Commission and would have to file\u000a        financial returns in substantially different forms to both regulators.\u000a      Confusion over the powers and obligations of managing trustees and\u000a        members.\u000a    \u000a    Our work proposed a new legal form for charities, which has been implemented\u000a    as the Charitable Incorporated Organisation in the Charities Act 2011, Part\u000a    11 (ss.204-250). The specific advantages of the new structure include:\u000a    \u000a      The provision of limited liability for managing trustees.\u000a      Single registration and regulation through the Charity Commission.\u000a      The legislation now clarifies the powers and duties of trustees and\u000a        members of the Charitable Incorporated Organisation.\u000a    \u000a    2. Research that has significantly enhanced the policy and practice\u000a        underpinning the effective operation of the charity sector\u000a    a. Tribunals (see reference 4 below)\u000a    Research conducted in 2010 and subsequently published in a journal\u000a      article identified deficiencies with the operation of the Charity\u000a      Tribunal. These include:\u000a    \u000a      The service is not available for all types of dispute.\u000a      Formality in the conduct of proceedings discourages charities from\u000a        using the Tribunal.\u000a      High costs of suit are a barrier to participation in the Tribunal.\u000a    \u000a    These observations directly influenced the production of the Hodgson\u000a      Report (2012), which contains recommendations on reforming the workings of\u000a      the Tribunal.\u000a    b. Alternate Dispute Resolution (see references 5 and 6 below)\u000a    Research conducted between 2000-2006 on charity disputes demonstrated\u000a      that there were significant benefits to charities of engaging in\u000a      Alternative Dispute Resolution. Benefits include:\u000a    \u000a      Speedier resolution of disputes so that trustees are free to pursue\u000a        their charities' objects.\u000a      Cost savings, through speed and informality, so that public money is\u000a        not perceived as having been wasted on a full hearing in court.\u000a      The potential for lack of negative publicity through non-public\u000a        proceedings, protecting the importance of the charity brand.\u000a    \u000a    The research directed that these services need to be made more readily\u000a      available and must be more clearly publicised.\u000a    All of the research outputs identified in section 3 were completed by\u000a      Warren Barr (now Senior Lecturer), Debra Morris (now Reader) or Jean\u000a      Warburton (now Emeritus-Professor) when employed at the University of\u000a      Liverpool. All of the work is either single or co-authored by members of\u000a      the Unit and conducted at Liverpool.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4441","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"458258","Name":"Latvia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Taken together, the research outputs detailed in Section 3 have led to a\u000a      combination of significant impacts for a range of important beneficiaries,\u000a      which can be divided into three main categories.\u000a    i) Benefiting the political and legal debate over Lisbon's\u000a        ratification within the UK and beyond; while also assisting with the\u000a        UK's legal preparations for implementing Lisbon\u000a    Within the UK, the research contributed to critical understanding of the\u000a      Lisbon Treaty among the country's political leaders. First, it did so by\u000a      helping to inform Parliament's decision about whether or not to ratify\u000a        Lisbon at all. Dougan's analysis of various major EU reforms and\u000a      their specific relevance for the UK, as summarised in \"Freer than we\u000a      were\", was quoted (with approval) by Edward Davey MP during a Commons\u000a      debate on the European Union (Amendment Bill) which led to the UK's\u000a      ratification of Lisbon. The same paper was also the subject of direct\u000a      (critical) correspondence by William Hague MP (then Shadow Foreign\u000a      Secretary) in Parliamentary Brief (March 2008 Issue).\u000a    Secondly, the research also directly assisted in Whitehall's\u000a        preparations for implementing Lisbon. In November 2009, Dougan was\u000a      the primary speaker at the only in-house event organised for the entire\u000a      Foreign and Commonwealth Office in preparation for Lisbon's entry into\u000a      force. That event was designed to identify the new Treaty's potential\u000a      implications for the UK and to explore the myriad challenges facing civil\u000a      servants and diplomats. The FCO noted that the high turnout for this event\u000a      meant that Dougan's work reached a wide audience, who appreciated his\u000a      focus on those issues of greatest interest to, and that directly affected\u000a      the work of, government policymakers. Moreover, the summary paper\u000a      delivered at this event, drawn directly from Dougan's CMLRev\u000a      analysis, was also widely circulated among the UK civil, legal and\u000a      diplomatic services - including senior members of the FCO, the UK\u000a      Permanent Representation to the EU, and the Cabinet Office.\u000a    In other EU Member States, ratification of the Lisbon Treaty caused\u000a      problems more in the judicial than in the parliamentary context: legal\u000a        challenges were brought to Lisbon's compatibility with national\u000a        constitutions as concerns the extent to which it had created a new\u000a      federal entity which threatened Member State sovereignty. In its 2009\u000a      ruling on the constitutionality of the Lisbon Treaty, the Latvian\u000a      Constitutional Court cited \"Winning Minds, Not Hearts\" as direct authority\u000a      for confirming that Lisbon did not fundamentally change the legal\u000a      character of the EU, nor the essential architecture of the EU's judicial\u000a      system, thus supporting the court's decision that Lisbon's ratification\u000a      would not be incompatible with the Latvian constitution.\u000a    \"Winning Minds, Not Hearts\" has also informed senior judicial\u000a        understanding of other Lisbon reforms particularly at the Court of\u000a      Justice of the European Union: e.g. it was cited by Advocate General\u000a      Trstenjak in the landmark NS case, as regards interpretation of\u000a      the new Protocol on application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to\u000a      Poland and the United Kingdom; and by Advocate General Kokott in the\u000a      equally important Inuit dispute, as representing the current state\u000a      of scientific opinion, in the English-language scholarship, concerning\u000a      Lisbon's impact upon the access to justice of individual citizens directly\u000a      before the EU courts.\u000a    ii) Benefiting Whitehall's understanding and Parliament's scrutiny of\u000a        the EU Act 2011\u000a    In late 2010, Dougan and Gordon submitted Written Evidence to the\u000a        European Scrutiny Committee of the House of Commons for the purposes of\u000a        its inquiry into the newly published EU Bill. Evidence concerning\u000a      Part 3 of the EU Bill, concerned with the impact of the draft legislation\u000a      upon the fundamental UK constitutional principle of parliamentary\u000a      sovereignty, was cited and discussed by the Committee in its final report.\u000a      It was also cited, as making a \"pretty powerful statement\", by Wayne David\u000a      MP during the plenary debate in the House of Commons.\u000a    Moreover, evidence concerning Part 1 of the EU Bill, concerned with the\u000a      legal and political problems associated with introducing a system of\u000a      \"referendum locks\" on a wide range of EU matters, was described as\u000a      \"particularly useful\" by the Committee and is cited repeatedly and\u000a      extensively in its final report. One point of particular influence\u000a        concerned the authors' unique research insight that there were\u000a      potential loopholes in the system of public and parliamentary control\u000a      provided for under the EU Bill. Based on those research findings, the\u000a      Committee specifically recommended amending the Bill so as to close those\u000a      very loopholes. That aspect of the evidence was also highlighted during\u000a      plenary debates in the House of Commons by both Emma Reynolds MP and\u000a      William Cash MP.\u000a    In Autumn 2010, Dougan was invited by the Foreign and Commonwealth\u000a        Office to take part in a closed roundtable discussion of academics\u000a      and NGOs aimed at informing the department's understanding of the detailed\u000a      provisions and broader implications of the EU Bill. In March 2011, Dougan\u000a      was also invited by The Constitution Trust to speak about the EU Bill to\u000a      the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Constitution (a regular\u000a      meeting of parliamentarians from the House of Commons, the House of Lords\u000a      and also the European Parliament to discuss issues of major constitutional\u000a      concern): summarising the authors' written evidence to the European\u000a      Scrutiny Committee, as well as answering questions from the various\u000a      parliamentary attendees, Dougan here sought to inform lawmakers' critical\u000a      understanding of the EU Bill at a key stage during its passage through the\u000a      Commons and shortly before its consideration by the Lords.\u000a    iii) Benefiting the political and legal debate within Parliament over\u000a        the Fiscal Compact, as regards its relationship to existing EU \/ UK law,\u000a        and its broader future implications\u000a    In early 2012, Dougan and Gordon submitted Written Evidence to the\u000a        European Scrutiny Committee of the House of Commons, for its public\u000a        inquiry into resolution of the Eurozone crisis. Dougan was also\u000a      among a small number of experts invited to give Oral Evidence to\u000a      the Committee at a public evidence session.\u000a    That evidence was cited repeatedly and extensively by the Committee in\u000a      its final Report. In particular, the authors' research findings\u000a        directly informed the Committee's critical evaluation of crucial but\u000a        deeply contested constitutional questions such as: whether the\u000a      Commission's roles under the Fiscal Compact were compatible with EU law;\u000a      whether the EU Courts could legitimately be granted jurisdiction over the\u000a      Fiscal Compact; and whether the UK had any legal grounds for objecting to\u000a      the Fiscal Compact as a matter of EU law. The authors' evidence was also\u000a      directly cited by David Lidington MP (Minister of State for Europe) during\u000a      an emergency House of Commons debate on the Fiscal Compact, as well as\u000a      during the Minister's own evidence to the European Scrutiny Committee.\u000a    After the adoption of the Fiscal Compact, the prospect of further EU\u000a      constitutional reform prompted a broad political debate about the UK's\u000a      future place within\/relationship to the rapidly evolving EU legal\u000a      landscape. In March 2012, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House\u000a        of Commons launched a major inquiry into UK Government policy on the\u000a        future of the European Union in the light of the \"December veto\".\u000a      Dougan and Gordon submitted Written Evidence to that inquiry; the\u000a      Committee itself solicited further views from Dougan and Gordon as the\u000a      inquiry progressed.\u000a    Once again, that evidence was cited repeatedly in the final report\u000a      of the Foreign Affairs Committee - the authors' research findings serving\u000a      directly to inform the Committee's analysis and evaluation of key issues\u000a      such as: the degree to which the legal obligations contained in the EU Act\u000a      may have influenced the Government's decision to exercise its veto over\u000a      amendments to the EU Treaties; how far the EU Act should be seen as a\u000a      watershed in the UK's policy towards the EU; and the complex legal issues\u000a      raised by the relationship between the EU Treaties and the Fiscal Compact.\u000a      On that last point, Dougan and Gordon were specifically credited for\u000a      having brought to the Committee's attention the highly pertinent\u000a      implications to be drawn from the recent Pringle ruling of the\u000a      European Court of Justice (Case C-370\/12; Judgment of 27 November 2012),\u000a      which confirmed the authors' interpretation of the legal relationship\u000a      between the Fiscal Compact and the post-Lisbon EU legal order, as they had\u000a      previously proposed to the European Scrutiny Committee.\u000a    Moreover, in his January 2013 keynote speech on the future of UK-EU\u000a      relations, the Prime Minister called for a debate about the\u000a        possibilities for greater flexibility in the terms of EU membership.\u000a      In February 2013, Dougan was invited to speak on the legal framework for\u000a      facilitating such greater flexibility within the EU legal order at a closed-door,\u000a        high-level policy forum on The Future of Europe organised by\u000a      Wilton Park (an agency of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office). That event\u000a      was attended by politicians, political advisors, diplomats and political\u000a      commentators from the UK and across the EU as well as the USA. Dougan\u000a      presented the paper subsequently published in CMLRev as \"What do\u000a      we want?\". His presentation was followed by a plenary Q&amp;A session in\u000a      which attendees explored further the various legal and policy issues\u000a      raised by Dougan's analysis of the Prime Minister's speech and the\u000a      prospects for more flexible EU policymaking.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case-study is based upon research by Prof Michael Dougan and Dr\u000a      Michael Gordon (both members of the Liverpool European Law Unit)\u000a      undertaken between 2008 and 2013.

This has posed important legal\u000a      challenges not just for the EU itself, but also for its Member States -\u000a      not least the UK - as they seek to redefine their own relationship to the\u000a      changing European landscape. Within that context, the research outputs\u000a      detailed in Section 3 explore three main interrelated themes; in each\u000a      case, identifying the key issues which should command legal and\u000a      political attention, providing original and objective critical\u000a        analysis of those issues, and offering practical recommendations\u000a      to guide future policymaking.\u000a    First, the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty 2007, which\u000a      entered into force in 2009 and brought with it sweeping reforms to the EU.\u000a      The research explores the constitutional significance of Lisbon for the\u000a      fundamental structures and principles underpinning the EU's institutions,\u000a      powers, procedures and policies. The research also addresses the impact of\u000a      Lisbon upon the EU's system of fundamental rights protection, and\u000a      discusses the new Treaty's relevance for broader debates about\u000a      citizenship, democracy and legitimacy in Europe.\u000a    Secondly, the UK's direct response to the Lisbon Treaty's entry\u000a      into force through enactment of the European Union Act 2011. That\u000a      legislation was proposed after the 2010 general election, in the light of\u000a      the Conservative Party's manifesto pledge to reassess the UK's\u000a      relationship to the EU. The Act is a major constitutional statute that\u000a      radically increases public and parliamentary control over a host of\u000a      decisions relating to British participation in European integration, as\u000a      well as clarifying the fundamental legal basis of the UK's membership of\u000a      the EU. The research critically assesses the Act's context, content and\u000a      implications for both Britain and Europe.\u000a    Thirdly, the conclusion of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination\u000a      and Governance 2012 (the so-called Fiscal Compact). At a meeting\u000a      of the European Council in December 2011, the UK controversially vetoed\u000a      any changes to the post-Lisbon EU Treaties designed to tackle the Eurozone\u000a      debt crisis. Instead, 25 Member States decided to pursue their reforms to\u000a      governance of the single currency through the medium of an ordinary\u000a      intergovernmental treaty. Here, the research explores various complex yet\u000a      crucial questions: the relationship between the Fiscal Compact and the\u000a      Lisbon Treaty's constitutional settlement for the EU as a whole; the\u000a      interaction between the Fiscal Compact and the provisions of the EU Act\u000a      specifically within the UK; and the broader implications of these\u000a      developments for the UK's very place within the EU.\u000a    All of the research underpinning this case-study was completed while\u000a      Dougan was employed as Professor of European Law and Gordon as Lecturer in\u000a      Public Law at the University of Liverpool. Some research outputs were\u000a      published in peer-reviewed academic journals\/edited collections. Others\u000a      were written specifically at the invitation of\/in response to\u000a      consultations by major public bodies, but the latter papers were also\u000a      drawn directly from academic publications in press or under preparation\u000a      for future publication. All relevant research outputs were published after\u000a      1 January 2008. All associated impacts occurred during the period from 1\u000a      January 2008 to 31 July 2013.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4442","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3194884","Name":"Montenegro"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The authors' research has influenced and benefited key stakeholders at EU\u000a      level (the European\u000a      Commission, the Parliament, the EU Fundamental Rights Agency), bodies of\u000a      international law (the\u000a      Council of Europe), and the NGO sector (UNICEF, Save the Children,\u000a      Eurochild), with the ultimate\u000a      aim of rendering the EU more responsive to children's rights issues. This\u000a      impact was achieved\u000a      through ongoing collaboration between the researchers and key\u000a      stakeholders, initially established\u000a      during the Children's Rights Indicators project for the Fundamental Rights\u000a      Agency, and\u000a      consolidated through a number of subsequent consultancies and KE events\u000a      (detailed below).\u000a      The research has yielded significant impact in two principal respects:\u000a    \u000a      It has resulted in more direct engagement with children's rights by\u000a          the EU\u000a          institutions in their development of EU laws and policies.\u000a      This is evidenced particularly in the activities of the Commission and\u000a        the Parliament. The insights\u000a        gained from the research detailed above directly influenced the\u000a        substantive content and scope of\u000a        the seminal `EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child', the\u000a        European Commission's inaugural plan\u000a        of action on children's rights: the recommendations put forward by\u000a        Stalford and Drywood in their\u000a        5,000 word formal response to the public consultation are reflected in\u000a        the published document\u000a        (2011); and Stalford was invited to participate in the Commission's\u000a        expert working group on\u000a        `Invisible Children' (an invitation which resulted from the research) to\u000a        identify how issues affecting\u000a        the most vulnerable and marginalised children in the EU could be\u000a        prioritised in the Agenda (2010).\u000a        More specifically, the Children's Rights Indicators study is\u000a        referred to in the EU Agenda for the\u000a        Rights of the Child as a means of supporting more evidenced-based\u000a        policy-making regarding\u000a        children. The indicators are also referred to in the Council of\u000a          Europe's parallel Strategy for the\u000a          Rights of the Child (2011). In the same vein, Save the\u000a          Children, in the context of its Child Rights\u000a        Governance campaign, has acknowledged that continued adherence to the\u000a        Children's Rights\u000a        Indicators is essential for the future development of European policy by\u000a        the Commission.\u000a        As far as the European Parliament is concerned, its 2012 report\u000a        consolidating the EU's legal\u000a        framework in relation to children's rights is heavily informed by the\u000a        authors' work, particularly that\u000a        published in the International Journal of Children's Rights (2011).\u000a        Stalford's (with Schuurman)\u000a        article shaped the report's conclusions on the Lisbon Treaty's impact in\u000a        the area; and the\u000a        Parliament's recommendations on how to integrate children's rights into\u000a        all stages of the EU law\u000a        and policy-making process draw extensively on Drywood's article on\u000a        `Child Proofing'. Stalford's\u000a        project with UNICEF (published in chapter 8 of her monograph\u000a        referred to above) has also been the\u000a        key reference point in their work with DG Enlargement and\u000a        countries wishing to join the EU,\u000a        enabling children's rights to be mainstreamed into the accession\u000a        negotiations with Montenegro in\u000a        particular.\u000a      The European Parliament also refers to the Children's Rights Indicators\u000a        developed by the authors\u000a        in its annual review of the EU's broader fundamental rights agenda,\u000a        encouraging their use in\u000a        reviewing EU actions relating to children's rights.\u000a      It has been adopted as a framework for the development of\u000a          children's rights\u000a          monitoring at European level and beyond.\u000a      Achieving mechanisms for effective monitoring is, in itself, integral\u000a        to the development of effective\u000a        law and policy and the authors' work has been at the forefront of\u000a        efforts in this regard. Within the\u000a        EU's own institutional framework, the European Commission (DG\u000a          Justice) has developed an\u000a        online database on the `EU acquis and policy documents on rights of the\u000a        child' which is informed by\u000a        the children's rights checklist developed by Stalford on behalf of UNICEF.\u000a        Furthermore, the EU\u000a          Fundamental Rights Agency has explicitly adopted the Children's\u000a        Rights Indicators as the\u000a        methodological basis for further international collaborative children's\u000a        rights projects, for example\u000a        relating to separated children and child trafficking.\u000a      More recently, Stalford was appointed by the Council of Europe\u000a          (CoE) to develop a self-\u000a        assessment tool to monitor implementation of the 2012 CoE Recommendation\u000a        on the Participation\u000a        of Children and Young People under the Age of 18. The tool, which\u000a        comprises a series of indicators,\u000a        adopts the methodology developed by the authors' EU-related work.\u000a      Further afield, within the NGO sector, the rights-based\u000a        methodology established for the indicators\u000a        study has been endorsed and adopted by other international agencies and\u000a        NGOs to inform the\u000a        development of indicators on a range of children's rights issues, for\u000a        example, by Actionaid in\u000a        relation to children's right to education and by the European Federation\u000a        for Street Children.\u000a        The long term benefits of this work for children themselves are\u000a        inevitable insofar as it has\u000a        provided a framework within which EU law and policy are developed,\u000a        monitored and evaluated in a\u000a        manner that is more directly and explicitly responsive to children's\u000a        rights and interests.\u000a    \u0009\u0009\u000a      ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Work carried out by Stalford and Drywood at the Liverpool Law School\u000a      between 2008 and\u000a      2012 has been at the forefront of EU action in the field of children's\u000a      rights. It has provided the\u000a      blue-print for a coherent approach to the development, monitoring and\u000a      evaluation of\u000a      children's rights at European level. In doing so, it has directly\u000a      influenced the way in which\u000a      laws and policies are formulated by the European institutions, towards\u000a      more explicit,\u000a      meaningful engagement with children.\u000a    In addition to the longer term benefits for children of more responsive\u000a      laws and policies at EU level,\u000a      the research cited in this case study has reached a wide range of\u000a      beneficiaries, encompassing the\u000a      EU institutions and agencies, the international legal community and the\u000a      NGO sector.

This aspect of the research illustrated\u000a      the growing importance of EU-\u000a      level intervention in a range of children's rights issues, particularly\u000a      those that cannot be tackled by\u000a      Member States acting alone (such as child trafficking, abduction, asylum\u000a      and poverty). It then\u000a      identified how the EU's constitutional, institutional, legal and\u000a      procedural framework might be\u000a      developed and adapted to accommodate children's rights more effectively,\u000a      using international\u000a      children's rights standards and guidance as a benchmark. These ideas have\u000a      been developed and\u000a      presented in a number of high quality, peer reviewed publications (see s.3\u000a      below). They have also\u000a      been widely disseminated through a series of research and knowledge\u000a      exchange events organised\u000a      by Stalford and Drywood, including a 3-day international EU children's\u000a      rights conference\u000a      (Liverpool, January 2009), and a symposium on EU children's rights\u000a      (Liverpool, November 2010,\u000a      leading to an edited collection by Stalford, Thomas and Drywood in 2011 -\u000a      see s.3).\u000a    Secondly, it has developed practical mechanisms by which the EU\u000a        institutions can\u000a        mainstream, monitor and evaluate children's rights in a way that is\u000a      compatible with\u000a      international children's rights principles. Prior to that, there were no\u000a      means of measuring how\u000a      EU measures affect children (positively or otherwise). This has been\u000a      achieved through two\u000a      projects in particular:\u000a    i. `Indicators to measure the implementation, protection, respect and\u000a        promotion of\u000a        children's rights in the European Union'. Building on their previous\u000a      work that identified\u000a      both the deficiencies in and potential of EU children's rights provision,\u000a      Stalford and Drywood\u000a      led a project for the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency (2008-9) (detailed in\u000a      s.3) to\u000a      develop a series of indicators to enable the EU to monitor the extent to\u000a      which its laws\u000a      and policies impact on children's rights in four key contexts: Family\u000a      Environment and\u000a      Alternative Care; Protection from Exploitation and Violence; Education,\u000a      Citizenship and\u000a      Cultural Activities; and Adequate Standard of Living. A particularly\u000a      innovative feature of the\u000a      indicators is that they are explicitly `rights-based', insofar as they are\u000a      grounded in the core\u000a      principles and accompanying guidance of the UN Convention on the Rights of\u000a      the Child\u000a      1989, the international `gold standard' for children's rights.\u000a    ii. `Children, Enlargement and the Acquis Communautaire',\u000a      (Stalford, funded by\u000a      UNICEF, Brussels Office, April-June 2009; and March-July 2012). This\u000a      research was\u000a      commissioned by the Brussels office of UNICEF in response to the findings\u000a      of the EU-\u000a      funded indicators project. The aim was to identify how children's rights\u000a      could be integrated\u000a      more explicitly into the EU enlargement process. It resulted in the\u000a      development of a\u000a      detailed checklist of child-related priorities and obligations relevant to\u000a      each aspect of the\u000a      accession process, again adopting the UN Convention on the Rights of the\u000a      Child and\u000a      accompanying guidance as a primary reference point.\u000a    The research was carried out by Helen Stalford and Eleanor Drywood\u000a      between 2008 and 2012\u000a      within the School of Law, University of Liverpool. Stalford was a Senior\u000a      Lecturer when the work\u000a      began and is now a Reader.

Their framework has been so widely endorsed by the\u000d\u000a      courts and used by\u000d\u000a      counsel that it left a profound mark on the law in this area. There are\u000d\u000a      few fields of English law where\u000d\u000a      the courts have made such pivotal and persistent use of academic research.\u000d\u000a      Indeed, so entrenched\u000d\u000a      has the Birks-Burrows approach become, that it is routinely described by\u000d\u000a      the courts and others as the\u000d\u000a      standard view of the area.\u000d\u000a    The research of Birks and Burrows has been favourably cited in scores of\u000d\u000a      decisions of the courts in\u000d\u000a      England and Wales (as well as in other `common law' jurisdictions,\u000d\u000a      including Australia, Canada and\u000d\u000a      Hong Kong). In these decisions, the courts gradually shaped a ground of\u000d\u000a      recovery that was, in English\u000d\u000a      law, entirely new. Restitution was known and recognised in the United\u000d\u000a      States and some other\u000d\u000a      jurisdictions. Nonetheless, seeing that there is space for, and a need\u000d\u000a      for, a kind of legal remedy, is not\u000d\u000a      sufficient to call it into being. Someone needs to articulate and\u000d\u000a      recognise its basic principles, and to\u000d\u000a      show how these can be integrated with the rest of the law of that\u000d\u000a      jurisdiction. In some areas, this is work\u000d\u000a      for Parliament, but in large fields of common law it falls to the courts.\u000d\u000a      So it is in the law of unjust\u000d\u000a      enrichment. When counsel and the courts sought guidance in developing this\u000d\u000a      area of law they naturally\u000d\u000a      looked to other jurisdictions. But they also looked to the work of legal\u000d\u000a      researchers, and in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales, very extensively to the work of Birks and Burrows. Their arguments\u000d\u000a      reached the courts by their\u000d\u000a      frequent citation by academic writers, through the work of counsel who\u000d\u000a      actively sought out research that\u000d\u000a      offered guidance that could be useful developing arguments, and by more\u000d\u000a      than a decade of direct\u000d\u000a      engagement with the legal profession in seminars at Oxford and elsewhere,\u000d\u000a      including Professor\u000d\u000a      Burrows' work in judicial education through the Civil Committee of the\u000d\u000a      Judicial Studies Board.\u000d\u000a    In the period 2008-2013, the courts made specific use of the post-1993\u000d\u000a      publications of Birks and\/or\u000d\u000a      Burrows in many leading cases, including the following:\u000d\u000a    (i) Arden LJ in Benedetti v Sawiris [2010] EWCA Civ 1427, having\u000d\u000a      just cited a passage from Burrows\u000d\u000a      [R2], immediately went on to say `I would add ... at this point\u000d\u000a      that the writings of scholars are of great\u000d\u000a      importance in the development of the law of restitution ...I have found\u000d\u000a      [them] helpful as background in\u000d\u000a      resolving some of the novel issues on this appeal.'

Having\u000d\u000a      cited at [86] Birks' [R4 and R1] he went on in the next paragraph\u000d\u000a      to reach a conclusion relying on their\u000d\u000a      analysis [C2].\u000d\u000a    (iii) In Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation v HMRC [2012]\u000d\u000a      2 WLR 1149, which concerned\u000d\u000a      restitutionary claims for several billions of pounds of overpaid\u000d\u000a      corporation tax, Lord Walker at [61] cited\u000d\u000a      Burrows [R3 at 544] as being `generally supportive' of the earlier\u000d\u000a      case of Phillips-Higgins before going\u000d\u000a      on to say that, contrary to what he had indicated in a previous case, he\u000d\u000a      now thought that `Phillips-Higgins\u000d\u000a      was rightly decided'. On the separate question of whether one needed a\u000d\u000a      demand for a\u000d\u000a      Woolwich claim, his Lordship, at [73], cited Burrows [R2, at\u000d\u000a      507-8] along with other writers arguing that\u000d\u000a      a demand was not needed before saying in the next paragraph, `This is a\u000d\u000a      formidable volume of\u000d\u000a      distinguished academic opinion' and then going on, at [79], to restate the\u000d\u000a      law as not needing a demand,\u000d\u000a      authoritatively settling an important and controversial point of law [C3].\u000d\u000a    (iv) In Investment Trust Companies v HMRC [2012] EWHC 458 (Ch) at\u000d\u000a      [38]-[39], which dealt with\u000d\u000a      restitution of incorrectly charged VAT, Henderson J said the following:\u000d\u000a      `It has now become conventional\u000d\u000a      to consider the question whether English law recognises a right to\u000d\u000a      restitution by reference to the four\u000d\u000a      questions ... namely:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a       a) Has the defendant been benefited, in the sense of being enriched?\u000d\u000a       b) Was the enrichment at the claimant's expense?\u000d\u000a       c) Was the enrichment unjust?\u000d\u000a       d) Are there any defences?\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    As Professor Andrew Burrows QC says in The Law of Restitution,\u000d\u000a      3rd edition (2011), at p.27, if the first\u000d\u000a      three questions are answered affirmatively, and the fourth negatively, the\u000d\u000a      claimant will be entitled to\u000d\u000a      restitution. He adds that these four elements \"constitute the fundamental\u000d\u000a      conceptual structure of an\u000d\u000a      unjust enrichment claim\". While reminding us that this is a framework for\u000d\u000a      analysis, Henderson J\u000d\u000a      continued, `I have no quarrel with this basic conceptual structure. ....'\u000d\u000a      And later at [74], he said, `The next question is whether the enrichment\u000d\u000a      of HMRC at the expense of the\u000d\u000a      claimants was unjust. As Professor Burrows explains in The Law of\u000d\u000a        Restitution 3rd edition (2011),\u000d\u000a      chapter 5, the traditional common law approach to this question requires\u000d\u000a      the claimant to establish the\u000d\u000a      existence of an \"unjust factor\" which caused the payment that the claimant\u000d\u000a      seeks to recover.'\u000d\u000a      The primary issue in the case was a question on the meaning of `at the\u000d\u000a      expense of'. Having looked at\u000d\u000a      various views, he set out the view of Burrows, saying at [54] that Burrows\u000d\u000a      occupied `a somewhat\u000d\u000a      intermediate position' before going on at [67] to decide that that\u000d\u000a      intermediate position was the correct\u000d\u000a      approach to apply [C4].\u000d\u000a    (v) Perhaps most importantly of all, on the appeal to the Supreme Court\u000d\u000a      in Benedetti v Sawiris [2013]\u000d\u000a      UKSC 50, Lord Clarke giving the leading judgment relied very extensively\u000d\u000a      on the work of Burrows.\u000d\u000a      There are favourable references to Burrows [R2] at [16], [18-20],\u000d\u000a      [22], [25] and to Burrows [R1] at [28]\u000d\u000a      and [31-32]. Indeed at [31]-[32], the very detailed examples set out in\u000d\u000a      Burrows [R1] are repeated and\u000d\u000a      the conclusions Burrows put forward on their basis are regarded as correct\u000d\u000a      [C5].\u000d\u000a    The broad general impact of Birks' research is fairly summarised by a\u000d\u000a      passage in his obituary in The\u000d\u000a        Times (July 9, 2004) [C6]: `By now [the late1990s] his work\u000d\u000a      was inspiring not only other academics but\u000d\u000a      was also influencing practitioners and judges. He came to be held in great\u000d\u000a      esteem by many senior\u000d\u000a      judges who admired the power of his analysis in pointing the way to a\u000d\u000a      principled decision. The respect\u000d\u000a      afforded to his views reached the point where, in one case, even a mere\u000d\u000a      footnote in a Birks article\u000d\u000a      proved to be the subject of several paragraphs of reasoning in the\u000d\u000a      speeches of the law lords.' That was\u000d\u000a      a case in 1996. But this is not mere background: given the way the common\u000d\u000a      law works, decisions\u000d\u000a      reached on the law of unjust enrichment in the period 2008-2013 continue\u000d\u000a      to rely on prior decisions that\u000d\u000a      were directly influenced by Birks, as well as on current decisions such as\u000d\u000a      those detailed above invoking\u000d\u000a      the work of Burrows. For example, in Haugesund Kommune v Depfa Bank\u000d\u000a      [2010] EWCA Civ 579 at\u000d\u000a      [152] Etherton LJ relied again on the case of Dextra Bank Trust Co Ltd\u000d\u000a        v Bank of Jamaica [2002] 1 All\u000d\u000a      ER (Comm) 193 in which the Privy Council said at [45], `Their Lordships\u000d\u000a      find themselves to be in\u000d\u000a      agreement with Professor Peter Birks who, in his article [see 4 above on\u000d\u000a      change of position] at p 49\u000d\u000a      rejected the adoption of the criterion of relative fault in forthright\u000d\u000a      language.'\u000d\u000a    The enormous impact of this research is acknowledged throughout the legal\u000d\u000a      profession. A leading QC\u000d\u000a      says `[T]he work done in this area of law by Professors Birks and Burrows\u000d\u000a      has been absolutely pivotal,\u000d\u000a      forming not only the core of the submissions by Counsel as to what the law\u000d\u000a      is or should be, but\u000d\u000a      (perhaps more significantly) also underpinning the decisions actually made\u000d\u000a      by the courts which are, of\u000d\u000a      course, littered with citations to both Professor Birks' and Professor\u000d\u000a      Burrows' works'. [C7] And one of\u000d\u000a      Britain's most senior judges, now retired, says `Their works made a major\u000d\u000a      contribution to the\u000d\u000a      development of the law by the House of Lords judges during this period.'\u000d\u000a      And `I regarded the\u000d\u000a      Professors' work as essential and extremely useful background reading when\u000d\u000a      I was preparing my\u000d\u000a      judgment in that case. This is because understanding the structure of the\u000d\u000a      English law in this field is\u000d\u000a      extremely important to its future development, and it is important that\u000d\u000a      the judges get this right when\u000d\u000a      writing their judgments. I found the clarity and accessibility of their\u000d\u000a      exposition of the subject of very\u000d\u000a      great assistance.'[C8]\u000d\u000a    The impact of this research endures; it affects everyone in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales who might have a claim\u000d\u000a      in unjust enrichment, or who might have to answer such a claim, and\u000d\u000a      everything from a phone bill\u000d\u000a      inadvertently paid twice, to disputes involving millions of pounds in\u000d\u000a      mistakenly paid tax.

This branch\u000d\u000a      was first officially recognised by\u000d\u000a      the highest court in the United Kingdom in 1991 and it is now widely\u000d\u000a      viewed as being an important and\u000d\u000a      independent part of the law as is, for example, the law of contract or the\u000d\u000a      law of tort. Every citizen and\u000d\u000a      institution is potentially affected by it, most obviously where payments\u000d\u000a      are made by mistake.

An individual's status as an employee\u000d\u000a      or worker depends upon\u000d\u000a      the terms of the contract they have with their employer. But the\u000d\u000a      employer's ability to draft the\u000d\u000a      contract may be, and sometimes has been, used by unscrupulous employers to\u000d\u000a      create the\u000d\u000a      impression that the individual is self-employed, not an employee or a\u000d\u000a      worker, and therefore not\u000d\u000a      entitled to such employment rights.

These cases\u000d\u000a      demonstrate sharp\u000d\u000a      divisions in the Court of Appeal, divisions that could only be resolved by\u000d\u000a      a definitive ruling by the\u000d\u000a      Supreme Court. It was on these Court of Appeal cases that the research of\u000d\u000a      Bogg and Davies\u000d\u000a      focused, providing a timely and relevant analysis of the problem, and\u000d\u000a      arguing for a particular\u000d\u000a      solution should an appropriate case reach the Supreme Court. It did in the\u000d\u000a      case of Autoclenz Ltd v\u000d\u000a        Belcher [C1]. Because their work was well regarded and known\u000d\u000a      to counsel, the Bogg and Davies\u000d\u000a      analysis informed the Supreme Court, which relied on their work in\u000d\u000a      deciding to reverse the\u000d\u000a      traditional approach.\u000d\u000a    The claimants in the case worked as car valeters for Autoclenz on a\u000d\u000a      piecework basis, as self-\u000d\u000a      employed contractors paying their own insurance, tax, and National\u000d\u000a      Insurance. Autoclenz then\u000d\u000a      required the valeters to sign contracts containing a substitution clause,\u000d\u000a      allowing them to engage others\u000d\u000a      to work on their behalf, and a `right to refuse work' clause. This\u000d\u000a      contract expressly stated that they\u000d\u000a      were independent contractors. However, Autoclenz expected a valeter not\u000d\u000a      coming into work to give\u000d\u000a      adequate notice of his absence (though it was accepted that none had ever\u000d\u000a      done so and that the\u000d\u000a      valeters were unaware of this provision.) The valeters claimed they were\u000d\u000a      in reality employees or, in the\u000d\u000a      alternative, workers entitled to at least some statutory rights. The\u000d\u000a      claimants won at first instance, but in\u000d\u000a      an ascending series of appeals the various tribunals vacillated, being\u000d\u000a      pulled sometimes by the\u000d\u000a      traditional approach, sometimes by considerations of fairness and a wish\u000d\u000a      to give effect to protective\u000d\u000a      legislation. Finally, in an important and unanimous decision, the Supreme\u000d\u000a      Court reversed the traditional\u000d\u000a      approach, recognising that it produced unjust results. Lord Clarke summed\u000d\u000a      up the decision as\u000d\u000a      follows:\u000d\u000a    `So the relative bargaining power of the parties must be taken into\u000d\u000a      account in deciding whether the\u000d\u000a      terms of any written agreement in truth represent what was agreed and the\u000d\u000a      true agreement will\u000d\u000a      often have to be gleaned from all the circumstances of the case, of which\u000d\u000a      the written agreement is\u000d\u000a      only a part. This may be described as a purposive approach to the\u000d\u000a      problem.' [35] Paragraph 28 of\u000d\u000a      Lord Clarke JSC's judgment (written for the Court) cites the research\u000d\u000a      identified in Section 3,\u000d\u000a      describing the article by Bogg [R1] as `valuable' and the article\u000d\u000a      by Davies [R4] as `illuminating'.\u000d\u000a      This work by Bogg and Davies is the only academic research cited in this\u000d\u000a      pivotal decision, which\u000d\u000a      relies on its analysis and adopts the interpretative policy recommended\u000d\u000a      therein.\u000d\u000a    As a result of this ruling, all courts and tribunals must now\u000d\u000a      look beyond the written contract\u000d\u000a      between the parties whenever it is alleged that this does not reflect the\u000d\u000a      true nature of the\u000d\u000a      individual's employment arrangements. Tribunals and lower courts are bound\u000d\u000a      to follow the decision\u000d\u000a      as a matter of precedent, and a new line of case-law is already beginning\u000d\u000a      to develop: see, for\u000d\u000a      example, Weight Watchers (UK) Ltd v Revenue and Customs Commissioners\u000d\u000a      [2011] UKUT 433\u000d\u000a      (TCC); [2012] STC 265 [C2]. The ruling must therefore also\u000d\u000a      influence the legal advice offered to\u000d\u000a      employers on the drafting of contracts.\u000d\u000a    The Supreme Court's decision is highly significant in both law and\u000d\u000a      policy. It has reversed a\u000d\u000a      longstanding line of case-law applying the traditional, contractual\u000d\u000a      approach in the employment\u000d\u000a      setting, thus changing a body of law that applies throughout the\u000d\u000a      jurisdiction and in all sectors of the\u000d\u000a      economy. The judgment will be of particular significance to those who\u000d\u000a      occupy what has been\u000d\u000a      described as a `grey area' in the labour market, where there is a degree\u000d\u000a      of uncertainty over their\u000d\u000a      employment status (neither clearly employees nor clearly self-employed).\u000d\u000a      This group has been\u000d\u000a      estimated to stand at 30% of the national labour force in Burchell, Deakin\u000d\u000a      and Honey, The\u000d\u000a        Employment Status of Individuals in Non-Standard Employment EMAR\u000d\u000a      Research Series no. 6\u000d\u000a      (London: DTI 1999). The overriding effect of the Supreme Court's decision\u000d\u000a      will be that individuals\u000d\u000a      in that `grey area' are now much more likely to be characterised as\u000d\u000a      workers or employees. The\u000d\u000a      decision increases the availability of employment rights to individuals\u000d\u000a      who are in reality workers or\u000d\u000a      employees even though their written contracts suggest otherwise. This has\u000d\u000a      increased the reach\u000d\u000a      and effectiveness of protective employment legislation [C3]. In\u000d\u000a      coming to this conclusion the\u000d\u000a      Supreme Court had recourse to the work of Boggs and Davies in both its\u000d\u000a      critical and affirmative\u000d\u000a      aspects. The Supreme Court does not often make such recourse. One of the\u000d\u000a      leading current\u000d\u000a      textbooks [C3] on labour law describes the Court's ruling as\u000d\u000a      `notable' for its reliance on Bogg and\u000d\u000a      Davies's research.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Professors Alan Bogg and Anne Davies was influential in\u000d\u000a      reforming the judicial\u000d\u000a      approach to the interpretation of contracts of employment. For many years,\u000d\u000a      English courts\u000d\u000a      construed contracts of employment primarily by reference to the written\u000d\u000a      agreement between the\u000d\u000a      parties. This permitted a form of abuse called `sham self-employment', in\u000d\u000a      which employers draft\u000d\u000a      contracts in such a way as to create the false impression that individuals\u000d\u000a      are self-employed, rather\u000d\u000a      than employees or workers, so that they are not entitled to statutory\u000d\u000a      employment rights. Work by\u000d\u000a      Bogg and Davies was heavily relied upon by the Supreme Court, which, in a\u000d\u000a      key decision in\u000d\u000a      Autoclenz, acknowledged the problem, and held that courts and\u000d\u000a      tribunals should henceforth be\u000d\u000a      more alert to situations in which the written agreement between the\u000d\u000a      parties does not reflect the true\u000d\u000a      nature of their relationship. The ruling affects working people throughout\u000d\u000a      the jurisdiction and in all\u000d\u000a      sectors of the economy. Bogg and Davies' research thus made it more\u000d\u000a      difficult for employers to\u000d\u000a      use these unfair, `sham', arrangements to abuse workers.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Oxford\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    The key outputs from the research were academic articles published in\u000d\u000a      leading general and\u000d\u000a      specialist peer-reviewed journals, and a book chapter:\u000d\u000a    \u000a[R1] Alan Bogg, `Sham self-employment in the Court of Appeal'\u000d\u000a      (2010) 126 Law Quarterly Review\u000d\u000a      166.\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000a[R2] Alan Bogg, 'Good Faith in the Contract of Employment: A Case\u000d\u000a      of the English Reserve?'\u000d\u000a      (2011) 32 Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal 729.\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000a[R3] Alan Bogg, 'Bournemouth University v Buckland:\u000d\u000a      Re-establishing Orthodoxy at the Expense\u000d\u000a      of Coherence?'

Anne Davies, Professor of Law and Public Policy (Oxford,\u000d\u000a      2001-present) works on various\u000d\u000a      aspects of labour and employment law and has published a number of\u000d\u000a      important articles in peer-\u000d\u000a      reviewed journals, and a book chapter, on issues relating to the personal\u000d\u000a      scope of employment law\u000d\u000a      [R4, R5 and R6]. Their research, though mutually supporting, was\u000d\u000a      carried out independently.\u000d\u000a    The courts' traditional approach to the interpretation of contracts in\u000d\u000a      the employment setting was to\u000d\u000a      focus on the written agreement between the parties, just as they would if\u000d\u000a      interpreting a commercial\u000d\u000a      contract. A difficulty with this approach is that the employment setting -\u000d\u000a      as highlighted in the\u000d\u000a      research noted above &#8212; is often marked by significant inequality of\u000d\u000a      bargaining power between the\u000d\u000a      parties. The employer is generally in a strong position and, with legal\u000d\u000a      advice, can draft the written\u000d\u000a      contract and present it to the individual on a `take-it-or-leave-it'\u000d\u000a      basis. This means that, under the\u000d\u000a      traditional approach, the employer's presentation of the\u000d\u000a      relationship was treated by the courts as\u000d\u000a      the agreement between both parties.\u000d\u000a    In studying these contracts and their interpretation, Bogg and Davies's\u000d\u000a      research identifies these\u000d\u000a      problems, shows how they arise out of the interpretative posture of the\u000d\u000a      traditional approach, and\u000d\u000a      suggests how the attendant risk of abuse can be reduced. Their method is\u000d\u000a      to offer a detailed\u000d\u000a      analysis of the case law informed by the social context in which the law\u000d\u000a      applies. They show that\u000d\u000a      contractual relationships in the employment setting are marked by\u000d\u000a      significant inequality of\u000d\u000a      bargaining power and, in this respect, diverge considerably from\u000d\u000a      commercial contracts, and\u000d\u000a      therefore should be interpreted and enforced differently. Over a period of\u000d\u000a      many years, the standard\u000d\u000a      interpretive posture of the courts looked solely at the contract\u000d\u000a      documents, giving scope for the\u000d\u000a      possibility of `sham self-employment', in which employers draft contracts,\u000d\u000a      or use `off the peg'\u000d\u000a      standard form contracts, to create the impression that individuals are\u000d\u000a      self-employed, not\u000d\u000a      employees or workers, so that they do not qualify for statutory employment\u000d\u000a      rights The courts'\u000d\u000a      approach to sham transactions is appropriate for settings such as taxation\u000d\u000a      in which the two parties\u000d\u000a      to an agreement work together to deceive a third party (usually the\u000d\u000a      Revenue) as to the nature of\u000d\u000a      their transaction. However, this approach is not relevant to employment\u000d\u000a      settings, in which the\u000d\u000a      employer proposes a contract and the individual may not fully understand\u000d\u000a      its significance. English\u000d\u000a      courts have adopted a nuanced and contextual approach to sham transactions\u000d\u000a      in other fields of\u000d\u000a      law, notably the landlord and tenant cases in which landlords purported to\u000d\u000a      grant licences instead of\u000d\u000a      leases in order to avoid statutory rent control. Bogg and Davies\u000d\u000a      show that this technique could\u000d\u000a      also be applied in the employment context, and that to do so would improve\u000d\u000a      the fairness and\u000d\u000a      justice of these transactions. The courts' new friendliness to this\u000d\u000a      approach results in part from their\u000d\u000a      reliance on this research.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4624","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The body of research detailed above had considerable impact by making\u000d\u000a      available to the MoJ, to human rights professionals, and to lawyers, a\u000d\u000a      body of empirical data and of theoretical and doctrinal legal argument\u000d\u000a      that undermined a common assumption in the debate about a domestic Bill of\u000d\u000a      Rights, and that clarified the legal notion of `proportionality'. The\u000d\u000a      research was embodied in a MoJ Report, to which members of the Joint\u000d\u000a      Committee on Human Rights drew attention, and witnesses to the inquiry\u000d\u000a      (including the responsible Minister) cited and relied upon. As a later\u000d\u000a      spin- off, its explanation of the doctrine of proportionality was included\u000d\u000a      in Ministry of Justice training materials for judges, and was relied on in\u000d\u000a      a leading practitioner's work on human rights (see [C6]).\u000d\u000a    The 2007 Lazarus\/Goold Report [R1] began an ongoing programme of\u000d\u000a      collaborative research between Lazarus and Goold for the MoJ which\u000d\u000a      continued until 2010, when the authors published their second and final\u000d\u000a      Report [R2]. During these years, the government published its\u000d\u000a      Green Paper on Rights and Responsibilities (Cm 7577). This was\u000d\u000a      published after a lengthy political debate in which the Lazarus\/Goold\u000d\u000a      Report was quoted by the Minister of Justice in a public lecture [C1],\u000d\u000a      and by human rights specialists testifying before Parliament's Joint\u000d\u000a      Committee on Human Rights [C3]. In the Green Paper, the Government\u000d\u000a      restated its commitment to the HRA, and said that any British Bill of\u000d\u000a      Rights and Responsibilities would have to work as a complement to it. As\u000d\u000a      it stated in the Executive Summary: `The Government is proud to have\u000d\u000a      introduced the Human Rights Act and it will not resile from it. Any new\u000d\u000a      Bill of Rights and Responsibilities might subsume the Human Rights Act, or\u000d\u000a      might preserve it as a separate Act.' The Green Paper went on to suggest\u000d\u000a      that any proposed British Bill of Rights and Responsibilities should not\u000d\u000a      include legally enforceable rights: `The Government does not consider a\u000d\u000a      general model of directly legally enforceable [rights or] responsibilities\u000d\u000a      to be the most appropriate for a future Bill of Rights and\u000d\u000a      Responsibilities.' This was elaborated in some detail in the body of the\u000d\u000a      paper, especially with respect to the rights of those accused of crime to\u000d\u000a      liberty, and to the right to a fair trial (e.g. page 32, paragraph 3.15).\u000d\u000a    The policy of the Green Paper reflected the Minister of Justice's\u000d\u000a      position as set out in his Mackenzie Stuart Lecture at Cambridge\u000d\u000a      University on 25 October 2007 [C1]. There, the then Justice\u000d\u000a      Secretary had argued that `any Bill of Rights could not have a reduced set\u000d\u000a      of rights or more heavily qualified rights than currently set out in the\u000d\u000a      ECHR without placing the UK in breach of its international obligations'.\u000d\u000a      As evidence for this proposition he relied heavily upon and quoted the\u000d\u000a      2007 Lazarus\/Goold study [R1]: `Studies show that Article 3 is\u000d\u000a      applied similarly not just in Strasbourg but also in the domestic courts\u000d\u000a      of UK, Germany, Spain and France to name but a few. Any argument that the\u000d\u000a      repeal of the Human Rights Act will mean that the consequences of Article\u000d\u000a      3 disappear is as disingenuous as it is flawed' [C1].\u000d\u000a    The 2007 Lazarus\/Goold Report [R1] had argued that the right not\u000d\u000a      to be subjected to torture was an absolute right that bound the UK and all\u000d\u000a      the other jurisdictions in the study, and had shown that repealing the HRA\u000d\u000a      would in fact make little difference to the way in which these individuals\u000d\u000a      would be treated. The mention of the binding nature of Article 3 (right\u000d\u000a      against torture) by the Minister of Justice in a public speech [C1]\u000d\u000a      is not only testimony to the influence of the Report [R1], it was\u000d\u000a      also highly significant in the context of the public debate on human\u000d\u000a      rights and security. Many politicians, and the tabloid press, are critical\u000d\u000a      of human rights law on the basis that it protects criminals and terrorist\u000d\u000a      suspects who would otherwise be deported to countries associated with\u000d\u000a      torture. This criticism featured heavily in 2013 debates over the\u000d\u000a      deportation to Jordan of Abu Qatada.\u000d\u000a    The importance of these findings has been acknowledged. According to the\u000d\u000a      Legal Adviser to the Joint Committee on Human Rights and a Visiting\u000d\u000a      Professor at Oxford, `The Lazarus\/Goold Report on how the principle of\u000d\u000a      proportionality operated in other Council of Europe member states made a\u000d\u000a      very significant contribution to ensuring that the debate on this\u000d\u000a      contentious subject was evidence- based. The Report was drawn to the\u000d\u000a      attention of the members of the Committee and referred to in the\u000d\u000a      Committee's briefing material, as well as being referred to by witnesses\u000d\u000a      to the inquiry, including the responsible Minister himself. Other common\u000d\u000a      misperceptions continued to dog the political debate about whether there\u000d\u000a      should be a UK Bill of Rights, but this research authoritatively laid to\u000d\u000a      rest the misperception that, in countries with national Bills of Rights,\u000d\u000a      laws and policies designed to counter terrorism are subject to less\u000d\u000a      intrusive scrutiny by the courts than is the case in the UK under the\u000d\u000a      Human Rights Act' [C2].\u000d\u000a    The MoJ found Lazarus and Goold's research for the first report helpful,\u000d\u000a      and commissioned them to undertake a second research project, which\u000d\u000a      resulted in their 2009 Report on The Relationship between Rights and\u000d\u000a        Responsibilities [R2]. This complemented their earlier\u000d\u000a      research by studying the potential risks associated with any attempt to\u000d\u000a      incorporate `responsibilities' into the existing constitutional framework.\u000d\u000a      The research explained the importance of ensuring that justiciable legal\u000d\u000a      rights do not become some kind of contingent reward for performing\u000d\u000a      nebulous responsibilities. The 2009 Report was commissioned by the MoJ to\u000d\u000a      `contribute to the debate on the relationship between rights and\u000d\u000a      responsibilities initiated by the Green Paper' on Rights and\u000d\u000a        Responsibilities [R2, page 1]. It provided\u000d\u000a      independent academic endorsement to the position laid out in the Green\u000d\u000a      Paper that `contingency' had to be avoided, and was explicit that it was\u000d\u000a      reinforcing this message [R2, page 1].\u000d\u000a    The influence of Lazarus and Goold's work also reached beyond the MoJ. It\u000d\u000a      was absorbed and relied upon by respected human rights experts in the\u000d\u000a      wider community, including the Commissioner at the Equality and Human\u000d\u000a      Rights Commission between 2006 and 2009, who in oral evidence to the Joint\u000d\u000a      Committee on Human Rights hearings regarding a UK Bill of Rights in 2008,\u000d\u000a      replied to a question as follows:\u000d\u000a    `The technical answer to your question is found in this research, which I\u000d\u000a      commend to all members of the Committee, if you have not already read it.\u000d\u000a      It is by the Ministry of Justice and Oxford University, called `Public\u000d\u000a      protection, proportionality and the search for balance'. It is a\u000d\u000a      comparative study of jurisdictions where the Convention is incorporated\u000d\u000a      and there is an additional Bill of Rights. In every case, in a nutshell,\u000d\u000a      it was found that actually, in jurisdictions that had additional Bills of\u000d\u000a      Rights, as well as incorporating the Convention, the courts tended to, if\u000d\u000a      you like, let the government off the hook far less frequently: they were\u000d\u000a      far more diligent and rigorous in their application of the fundamental\u000d\u000a      rights that were in their Bills of Rights and they took a more strenuous\u000d\u000a      approach to the proportionality principle which is in play in security\u000d\u000a      versus individual freedom cases...So I think this idea that having your\u000d\u000a      own Bill of Rights somehow means that you get Strasbourg off your back is\u000d\u000a      not based on any evidence or research' [C3].\u000d\u000a    In 2009, Klug reiterated the point in a popular political journal:\u000d\u000a      `Cameron has advanced the case that a British Bill of Rights would somehow\u000d\u000a      allow British governments to ignore European Court of Human Rights rulings\u000d\u000a      it does not agree with - a proposition that has been demolished by\u000d\u000a      research from Oxford University, which demonstrated that, if anything, the\u000d\u000a      reverse applies' [C4, p.421-2].\u000d\u000a    A final wave of impact of the research [R1, R2] came through its\u000d\u000a      use by those who were training judges, and by those arguing before those\u000d\u000a      judges. The MoJ training materials on the idea of `proportionality' in\u000d\u000a      human rights decisions included selections from the Lazarus\/Goold research\u000d\u000a      because they articulated a working definition of that idea that was found\u000d\u000a      to be clear and accessible to judges new to human rights reasoning. And in\u000d\u000a      what is described as `the leading practitioner text on the law of human\u000d\u000a      rights' Lazarus and Goold are referred to and followed on these complex\u000d\u000a      issues [C6, p. 353].\u000d\u000a    In government, in Parliament, in the human rights community, and in the\u000d\u000a      world of legal practice, the research of Liora Lazarus and her Oxford\u000d\u000a      colleagues has contributed to a better informed understanding of tensions\u000d\u000a      between human rights and security, and of the legal doctrine of\u000d\u000a      proportionality that is often called on to resolve them.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted by Dr Liora Lazarus and colleagues at Oxford helped\u000d\u000a      shape public and parliamentary debate on the merits of a domestic Bill of\u000d\u000a      Rights for Britain. Some had argued that if Britain were to replace the\u000d\u000a      Human Rights Act (HRA), which allows rights in the European Convention on\u000d\u000a      Human Rights (ECHR) to be argued before domestic courts, with a British\u000d\u000a      Bill of Rights, the government would gain greater flexibility, e.g. in\u000d\u000a      addressing terrorist threats.

The principal investigators for this research were Dr\u000d\u000a      Liora Lazarus (Lecturer in Law at Oxford since 2000), Professor Benjamin\u000d\u000a      Goold (Lecturer in Law at Oxford from 2003 to 2009) and Gabriel Swiney\u000d\u000a      (Research Associate, Oxford, from October 2006 - September 2007).\u000d\u000a    Lazarus produced a first public Report for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ)\u000d\u000a      in 2007. The underpinning research was a comparative analysis of carefully\u000d\u000a      selected cases where courts had to balance security demands against human\u000d\u000a      rights in the UK, Germany, France, Spain, and in the European Court of\u000d\u000a      Human Rights (ECtHR). This analysis was published in a MoJ Report, `Public\u000d\u000a      Protection, Proportionality, and the Search for Balance' [Section 3:\u000d\u000a        R1]. This report built on a body of prior work by the authors.\u000d\u000a      Firstly, the 2007 MoJ Report was comparative in method and included an\u000d\u000a      analysis of Germany's approach to human rights. The comparative method\u000d\u000a      applied in the report, and the material on Germany's rigorous approach to\u000d\u000a      proportionality and human rights, were set out by Lazarus in her monograph\u000d\u000a      Contrasting Prisoners' Rights (OUP 2004) [R4]. Secondly,\u000d\u000a      the 2007 MoJ report applied a theoretical treatment of the balance between\u000d\u000a      security and human rights which Lazarus developed with Goold in their\u000d\u000a      collection Security and Human Rights [R3]). This argued\u000d\u000a      that the reconciliation of security and human rights was unavoidable in a\u000d\u000a      liberal democracy, and that a rigorous approach to proportionality was the\u000d\u000a      primary means through which to achieve this necessary reconciliation.\u000d\u000a      Thirdly, the 2007 MoJ report drew on Lazarus's own work on the\u000d\u000a      `proportionality principle' as a transparent judicial methodology, which\u000d\u000a      she developed in her paper, `Conceptions of Liberty Deprivation' [R5].\u000d\u000a    The empirical research behind these papers involved a systematic study of\u000d\u000a      all court cases involving a conflict between human rights and security in\u000d\u000a      the UK, Germany, France, Spain and the ECtHR. Data on 192 cases were\u000d\u000a      collected, read, and subjected to qualitative and quantitative analyses.\u000d\u000a      This was, and remains, the most comprehensive European data set on human\u000d\u000a      rights cases on the legal notion of `proportionality'. The Report first\u000d\u000a      subjected the data to quantitative comparisons between jurisdictions, such\u000d\u000a      as how many cases each decided, how often a `proportionality' test was\u000d\u000a      applied, and how often governments won in rights-versus-security cases.\u000d\u000a      The second analysis was qualitative, involving a detailed study of\u000d\u000a      decisions in rights-versus- security cases across these jurisdictions. It\u000d\u000a      examined how rights are applied and how courts use the concept of\u000d\u000a      proportionality to adjudicate conflicts between security and a range of\u000d\u000a      rights: against torture, against inhuman and degrading treatment, rights\u000d\u000a      to liberty and security, to a fair trial, to privacy, to family life, and\u000d\u000a      rights to freedom of expression and association. The analyses showed that\u000d\u000a      British courts interpreting the ECHR are considerably less\u000d\u000a      demanding in their application of proportionality than are courts in\u000d\u000a      countries with domestic constitutional bills of rights. The Report also\u000d\u000a      argued that the ECHR is a minimum set of protections in Europe that binds\u000d\u000a      all member states without exception.\u000d\u000a    Britain was thus shown to be no more hampered by human rights law when\u000d\u000a      pursuing its security interests than are comparable jurisdictions with\u000d\u000a      domestic bills of rights (see [R1], page ii; and also [Section\u000d\u000a        5: C4] which refers to this finding). The less flexible and more\u000d\u000a      demanding role of a proportionality test in other jurisdictions was linked\u000d\u000a      to the fact that courts under domestic constitutions are vested with\u000d\u000a      significant authority to review their respective governments and\u000d\u000a      parliaments in the light of constitutional rights. This strongly suggested\u000d\u000a      that a justiciable `British Bill of Rights' would in fact result in\u000d\u000a      stricter rights protections in British courts [R1, page iii].\u000d\u000a      One common argument in favour of such a bill was shown to be without\u000d\u000a      secure legal or empirical foundation, and the doctrine of proportionality\u000d\u000a      was itself better explained.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5000","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Home's DfID research on land titling and poverty reduction (published as\u000a      Demystifying the Mystery of Capital in 2004) has continued to\u000a      involve him in a range of impact activity in the current REF period.

This\u000a      investigated Hernando de Soto's linkage of land titling and Third World\u000a      poverty reduction, through interviews with occupiers of informal\u000a      settlements in three country case studies (Botswana, Trinidad and Zambia).\u000a      The research found that the benefits of formal land titling programmes for\u000a      the poor in Third World countries were fewer than expected, and the costs\u000a      greater. The project outcomes were published in a book, Demystifying\u000a        the Mystery of Capital (2004, ref.1 below). This research resulted\u000a      in a consultancy on post-disaster land policy issues (2006-8, see section\u000a      4 below), and field research in South Africa and Kenya (contributing to\u000a      Home's REF2 outputs 1, 2 &amp; 3). His research from archival and other\u000a      sources found that colonial land laws still significantly influence land\u000a      tenure and urban governance in African countries, inhibiting land law\u000a      reforms.\u000a    Home's research on development land assembly and land ownership involved\u000a      both UK and transnational research on legal instruments for land assembly.\u000a      His article on UK land ownership (2009, ref.4 below), while recognizing\u000a      the fragmented and limited data available on land ownership, summarised\u000a      the broad changes in land ownership during the past century, and addressed\u000a      some critical emerging issues, such as environmental protection, risk\u000a      assessment, and housing land supply, identifying some future directions\u000a      for land ownership and the role of the state.\u000a    Comparative research on land readjustment as a tool for development site\u000a      assembly (ref.3 below) drew Home into the history of land titling in the\u000a      Middle East, and resulted in his 2007 Pakistan earthquake consultancy\u000a      discussed in section 4 below. The published outputs included a historical\u000a      study of colonial and postcolonial land law in Israel\/Palestine' in Social\u000a        &amp; Legal Studies journal. A joint article with PhD student\u000a      (Haitam Suleiman) (2010, ref.2 below) examines the large-scale transfer of\u000a      waqf (Islamic trust) land in Israel\/Palestine to Jewish control\u000a      since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, and places that\u000a      confiscation within a context of postcolonial legal pluralism. The role of\u000a      successive Absentee Property Laws in this confiscation was related to\u000a      Ottoman land tenure categories and the Ottoman Land Code, as modified\u000a      under the British League of Nations Mandate. The special legal status of waqf\u000a      in the Old City Jerusalem was discussed, and recent legal disputes over\u000a      the status of certain mosques and cemeteries examined.\u000a    As a result of his land titling research for DfID (above) Home was\u000a      invited to contribute a chapter for a collection on African land policy in\u000a      Southern Africa (2011, ref.5 below), linking the colonial legacy in land\u000a      rights to emerging African Union policy on land. He was then invited to\u000a      edit a volume (which later grew to two volumes) on African land law,\u000a      funded by the World Bank as part of a major project on the rule of law in\u000a      Africa. For this he assembled over twenty contributors from sub-Saharan\u000a      African countries, His own chapters in the two books examined the\u000a      difficulties in developing a `pro-poor' land law for Africa from a\u000a      postcolonial legal historical perspective, and the continuing influence of\u000a      colonial township rules upon urban governance.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5846","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2562770","Name":"Malta"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has led to the use of effective assessment methods for\u000a      thousands of offenders in several jurisdictions, to new approaches to the\u000a      measurement and assessment of supervision skills, and to comprehensive\u000a      evaluation of service outcomes within Jersey itself.\u000a    Research on LSI-R in England and Wales and Jersey was disseminated widely\u000a      to practitioners through conferences and training events both before and\u000a      since the start of 2008. Professor Raynor gave related presentations to\u000a      eight conferences, including British (1999 and 2004), American (1999) and\u000a      European (2008) Societies of Criminology and conferences organised by the\u000a      Scottish Office (1997), the Home Office (2002, 2003) and the Jurats\u000a      (judges) of Jersey (2001), plus lectures in Cambridge (2009), Sheffield\u000a      (2003), Neuchatel (2008) and Barcelona (2009). Training events were\u000a      organised throughout Britain and in other countries by the Cognitive\u000a      Centre Foundation (CCF), a training consultancy based in South Wales which\u000a      distributes LSI-R on behalf of the copyright owners, Multi-Health Systems\u000a      of Toronto. (Neither Swansea University nor any members of its staff\u000a      receive any financial benefit from the distribution of LSI-R, in order to\u000a      preserve the independence and integrity of ongoing research.) Professor\u000a      Raynor has spoken at some CCF training events.\u000a    Advice was also given to Ministers and officials in the course of\u000a      Professor Raynor's membership of Government criminal justice Accreditation\u000a      Panels in England and Wales (1999-2009, and 2012 onwards) and Scotland\u000a      (2003-5), and of Scotland's National Advisory Body on Offender Management\u000a      (2005-9). England and Wales accepted the broad principles of risk\/need\u000a      assessment but preferred to develop their own method for offender\u000a      assessment, known as the Offender Assessment System - OASys.\u000a    Typically, organisations interested in the development of risk\/need\u000a      assessment became aware of the LSI-R research through publications\u000a      (including in practitioner journals), conferences or discussions in\u000a      advisory bodies and obtained further information from Swansea, together\u000a      with advice on practical implementation from Jersey where implementation\u000a      was most highly developed. If as a result they decided to use LSI-R or its\u000a      derivatives, they would then enter into a training arrangement with CCF.\u000a      Reports from Scotland, Ireland and the CCF make it clear that the research\u000a      findings were a critical factor in deciding to use this particular\u000a      approach to assessment: for example, the Chief Executive of the Scottish\u000a      Risk Management Authority (see section 5) states that `the work of\u000a        Peter Raynor has been used in all the LSI-R training in Scotland from\u000a        the late 1990s to the present time', `this research has had a\u000a        very practical impact, and also influence on policy', and `this\u000a        set of studies has great impact in the UK where such systematic and\u000a        sustained effort is rare'. An Assistant Principal Probation Officer\u000a      of the Irish Probation Service states that `without the availability\u000a        of this research we would have been floundering in the dark' and `no\u000a        other development since 1975 has been as significant in terms of impact\u000a        and outcomes'.\u000a    The Director of the CCF writes `the Raynor studies were instrumental\u000a        in providing evidence of [the LSI-R's] validity in a UK context\u000a        and paved the way for continued applicability in many UK areas'.\u000a      Impacts since 2008 are in some cases continuations of earlier impacts: in\u000a      Scotland training was completed in 2011 covering about 1,200 social\u000a      workers, and in the Republic of Ireland implementation began in 2006 and\u000a      was completed during 2008, with about 23,000 offenders assessed since July\u000a      2008. The LSI-R has also been adopted in Malta in 2010 following advice\u000a      from Ireland. According to the CCF, the National Board for Forensic\u000a      Medicine in Sweden has sought and received training in LSI-R in 2009 as a\u000a      direct result of assessing the Swansea research, staff of the Ministry of\u000a      Justice in Denmark received training in 2013, and other countries\u000a      including Portugal may do so. Correspondence from the Director of CCF\u000a      indicates that the economic impact on the work of the CCF itself has also\u000a      been substantial, with a large part of their work being LSI-related from\u000a      1996 to the present, resulting also in royalty payments to the copyright\u000a      holders in Canada.\u000a    Dissemination of the supervision skills study has also been through\u000a      publications and conferences, and particularly through the annual\u000a      conferences of CREDOS. This was founded in 2007, following discussions at\u000a      the European Society of Criminology in T&#252;bingen in 2006 where a paper by\u000a      Professor Raynor on research in Jersey led to meetings between researchers\u000a      interested in direct research on individual supervision practice. CREDOS\u000a      now brings together researchers and practitioners from ten countries and\u000a      has produced the recent book Offender Supervision. Other practical\u000a      impacts of the skills study to date include a presentation by the Chief\u000a      Probation Officer of the Jersey Probation and After Care Service at the\u000a      2010 conference of CREDOS in Melbourne, training workshops by Dr Ugwudike\u000a      at the Scottish Risk Management Authority conference in March 2011, and\u000a      consequent enquiries about use of the Jersey Supervision Skills Checklist\u000a      developed in the study. Following presentations of material from the study\u000a      in Professor Raynor's 2011 Bill McWilliams Memorial Lecture at the\u000a      Cambridge Institute of Criminology and at two invited Ministry of Justice\u000a      (MoJ) Offender Management Seminars in 2011 and 2013, all attended by\u000a      officials, managers and practitioners, eight Probation Trusts in England\u000a      and Wales have also approached Jersey about possible use of the skills\u000a      checklist in staff development. In addition the Jersey study is one of the\u000a      influences on the SEED project (Skills for Effective Engagement and\u000a      Development) being implemented since 2010 by the MoJ in eight Probation\u000a      Trusts, and a short report on the study was published by the MoJ as Offender\u000a        Engagement Research Bulletin 9 in 2011. Professor Raynor is a member\u000a      of the Academic Reference Group for the Offender Engagement Programme\u000a      (which includes SEED) and provided detailed advice to the SEED manager.\u000a      The impact of this advice is evident, for example, in the use made in SEED\u000a      of direct observation of interviews, structured feedback and research\u000a      findings from Jersey.\u000a    Within Jersey itself, information from the Chief Probation Officer\u000a      indicates that the LSI-R based research has enabled his Service to become\u000a      one of very few public services in Jersey able to demonstrate ongoing\u000a      evaluation of the impact of their work. The research has been `key to\u000a        internal monitoring and planning processes' and has been used to `influence\u000a        policy-makers and the allocation of resources'. The Minister\u000a      responsible for the Crown Dependencies wrote to the Chief Probation\u000a      Officer on 22\/7\/10 to commend the research on LSI-R and to report that he\u000a      was sending it on to officials in the Ministry of Justice: `I should\u000a        like to congratulate you and your colleagues at the Jersey Probation and\u000a        After-Care Service . . . and also Dr Miles, Professor Raynor and Ms\u000a        Coster (research assistant in Jersey) on producing an\u000a        interesting, encouraging and significant report.' In addition,\u000a      material produced in the skills study is being applied to staff\u000a      development in a carefully monitored exercise which will help to inform\u000a      developments elsewhere, and the Chief Probation Officer reports that\u000a      information from the study has been provided to `10 other probation\u000a        organisations in the British Isles, Australia and the USA'.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes the international impact of research carried\u000a      out by Swansea criminologists in partnership with criminal justice\u000a      agencies in the Channel Island of Jersey. This has included work on risk\u000a      and need assessment and, in a linked study, on supervision skills used by\u000a      probation staff. This research has a documented impact with international\u000a        reach, mainly since 2008, affecting policy and practice in Jersey,\u000a      Scotland, the Irish Republic, the Isle of Man, Malta, Sweden and Denmark,\u000a      and (in relation to the skills study only) England and Wales, and has\u000a      attracted interest in the USA, Australia and Portugal. Its significance\u000a      lies mainly in the fact that the risk and need assessment study has led to\u000a      structured and evidence-based assessment of (currently) about 15,000\u000a      offenders per year, or about 45,000 to date, in jurisdictions where no\u000a      structured assessment methods were previously used. About 35,000 of these\u000a      represent impact since the start of 2008. In addition, the study of\u000a      supervision skills has contributed since 2008 to the measurement and\u000a      development of skills in offender supervision in England, Wales, Scotland\u000a      and Jersey.

From 1996 to 2001 a series of pilot\u000a      studies carried out by Peter Raynor (Professor of Criminology and Criminal\u000a      Justice since 1996) evaluated the use by several Probation Services of a\u000a      new assessment instrument originally developed by Don Andrews and James\u000a      Bonta in Canada. This was the Level of Service Inventory - Revised\u000a      (LSI-R), which is completed by probation officers to record their\u000a      assessment of an offender's needs, and also provides a risk score which,\u000a      with appropriate calibration, can be used to estimate the probability of\u000a      reconviction. Some evaluation of the pilots was funded by the\u000a      participating probation services, of which Jersey was the first, via the\u000a      Cognitive Centre Foundation in South Wales, which awarded a grant to\u000a      Raynor to carry out the research. A further study of LSI-R in the pilot\u000a      areas in England and Wales was subsequently funded by the Home Office and\u000a      carried out by Raynor with Jocelyn Kynch (Research Assistant (RA)\u000a      1998-2000) in Swansea and with Colin Roberts and Simon Merrington of the\u000a      Probation Studies Unit in Oxford.\u000a    These studies, for which Jersey provided the most reliable and\u000a      comprehensive data, showed that probation officers could use these\u000a      methods, that LSI-R (with slight modifications and calibration) was a\u000a      reasonably reliable reconviction predictor in Britain, and that changes in\u000a      offenders' LSI-R scores were significantly related to increases and\u000a      decreases in the probability of reconviction (see R1 and R2 below). This\u000a      relationship had not previously been demonstrated in any large-scale\u000a      study. In other words, the Swansea research demonstrated the validity of\u000a      these methods for use outside North America and added significantly to the\u000a      general evidence of their efficacy.\u000a    In Jersey work continued as part of a long-term research partnership with\u000a      Swansea, which has also included research on youth justice, community\u000a      safety and policing. Work funded by the Jersey Probation Service\u000a      concentrated on the use of LSI-R in service evaluation, and reconviction\u000a      studies including LSI-R data were produced and published in 2001, 2004 and\u000a      2009 by Raynor and Dr. Helen Miles, a Jersey civil servant who obtained\u000a      her PhD from Swansea (2001-7). These studies confirmed the usefulness of\u000a      LSI-R in measuring changes during (sometimes as a result of) supervision\u000a      (see R3), and led directly to the idea of studying the supervision input\u000a      of staff and relating it to changes in risk\/need assessments and behaviour\u000a      among the offenders they supervise. The resulting study has been under way\u000a      since 2007, funded by Jersey Probation Service and carried out by Raynor\u000a      together with Dr Pamela Ugwudike (then RA, lecturer since 2009) and\u000a      Professor Maurice Vanstone (Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice,\u000a      Emeritus since 2009), with assistance from Dr Miles and from the Chief\u000a      Probation Officer of Jersey.\u000a    This study has so far involved the collection of 95 videotaped\u000a      interviews, analysis of the skills used by probation officers in them, and\u000a      analysis of changes in LSI-R assessments and offending by the supervised\u000a      offenders. Findings so far show that officers vary considerably in the\u000a      skills they use (see R4), and that offenders supervised by officers who\u000a      consistently use a wide range of skills make more progress under\u000a      supervision, with reductions in assessed risk levels and a reconviction\u000a      rate over two years which is significantly lower than that of similar\u000a      offenders supervised by less skilled staff (see R5 and R6). Three other\u000a      recent studies carried out by members of CREDOS [see below], one in\u000a      Canada, one in Australia and one in the USA, have also related individual\u000a      supervision skills to outcomes. However, Swansea's study is unique in its\u000a      use of video recording, which gives a more complete and durable record for\u000a      research, in the development of a skills assessment checklist and manual\u000a      which can be used by practitioners as well as researchers, and in the size\u000a      of the effects.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5847","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Welsh legislation\u000a      In July 2009, Williams, on behalf of the Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group,\u000a      sent an outline legislative\u000a      proposal to Welsh Ministers when they were planning what became the Rights\u000a      of Children and\u000a      Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011. The proposal was based on the research\u000a      insights at 2(iv)\u000a      above. The Welsh Ministers accepted the proposal but encountered\u000a      resistance from their officials\u000a      to a pervasive duty. In September 2009 Williams was commissioned to work\u000a      with officials. Initially\u000a      this helped restore Ministers' original intentions: `... by early\u000a        December it appeared that the\u000a        politicians had prevailed, and a proposal emerged from officials which\u000a        reflected the aspirations of\u000a        sponsoring Ministers, Cabinet and the First Minister'. (C1 below, p.\u000a      28)\u000a    In December 2009 there was a change in Ministerial portfolios following\u000a      the First Minister's\u000a      retirement. New Ministers were persuaded to restrict the proposed duty to\u000a      `relevant functions'\u000a      which Ministers themselves would specify on advice from civil servants.\u000a      Williams continued to\u000a      advocate the unrestricted application necessary to support the integrated,\u000a      whole government\u000a      approach required by the UNCRC. Advocacy for the latter approach was then\u000a      conducted outside\u000a      as well as within the government: `That [the restricted duty] did not\u000a        ultimately form the basis of the\u000a        Measure was the result of resolute and informed opposition by the NGO\u000a        community, the ad hoc\u000a        group of lawyers ... the scrutiny carried out by the Legislation\u000a        Committee, the Children and Young\u000a        People Committee and the Constitutional Affairs Committee'. (C1\u000a      below, p. 28)\u000a    In March 2010 pre-legislative public consultation began. Williams and\u000a      Hoffman supplied the NGO\u000a      community with advice derived from the research insights to help inform\u000a      responses. In April 2010\u000a      an `experts meeting' was convened in the UoA, attended by Welsh academics\u000a      and practitioners,\u000a      statutory bodies, AMs, UNICEF representatives and UK children's rights\u000a      experts. Written views\u000a      were also solicited from international experts. This helped achieve an\u000a      overwhelming majority of\u000a      responses in favour of an unrestricted duty, and influenced a key\u000a      political actor, the then\u000a      chairperson of the National Assembly's Children and Young People\u000a      Committee, National Assembly\u000a      for Wales, who attended the meeting and as a result formed the view that\u000a      the Committee should\u000a      take the unusual step of undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny (C1 below p.\u000a      31, and see contacts list).\u000a    In June 2010, the Ministers responded to the pre-legislative consultation\u000a      and a revised draft\u000a      Measure was introduced, containing a duty which applied to all functions\u000a      but only when the\u000a      exercise could be characterised as `strategic'. Williams and Hoffman\u000a      viewed this restriction as\u000a      equally problematic as the earlier one. Williams and other Monitoring\u000a      Group members gave\u000a      evidence to the National Assembly's Children and Young People Committee\u000a      and legislative\u000a      scrutiny committee (LC5). Williams was invited to return to LC5 with\u000a      further evidence. Williams and\u000a      Hoffman convened a second `experts' meeting' at which the restrictive and\u000a      pervasive approaches\u000a      were tested with particular reference to child poverty. This reinforced\u000a      the benefit of the pervasive\u000a      approach and had persuasive impact on two key Assembly Members (the Chair\u000a      of Children and\u000a      Young People Committee and a Minister \/ member of LC 5, see contacts\u000a      list), and informed\u000a      Williams' written evidence to LC5 (C8 below).\u000a    In September 2010, Williams and Hoffman led an `ad hoc' lawyers' group\u000a      giving oral evidence to\u000a      LC5. The Swansea evidence `made direct and fundamental differences to\u000a        the Measure which was\u000a        adopted by the National Assembly. The quality of that evidence, and its\u000a        foundation in empirical and\u000a        comparative research, assisted our scrutiny as legislators and helped\u000a        change the mind of\u000a        government in important respects. ... Without their intervention, I am\u000a        sure that the Rights of the\u000a        Child Measure would have been considerably weaker'. (C2 below)\u000a    In November 2010, in light of the LC5's report on its scrutiny of the\u000a      draft Measure, the responsible\u000a      Welsh Minister conceded the case for a pervasive duty. In January 2011 the\u000a      Minister tabled the\u000a      necessary amendments and the Measure as so amended was passed, receiving\u000a      royal approval on\u000a      16 March. The insights from research had thus influenced the outcomes of\u000a      the legislative scrutiny\u000a      process and helped realise the original political aspiration for a\u000a      pervasive duty: `.... the\u000a        effectiveness of the NGO community was heightened by the legal and\u000a        policy expertise of the ad\u000a        hoc group of lawyers and seminars hosted by Swansea University School of\u000a        Law. A cold-light-of-\u000a        day analysis will, in my opinion, indicate the central importance of\u000a        that community in ensuring that\u000a        the Government remained true to its original intentions' (Rt. Hon.\u000a      Rhodri Morgan, Speech to 5th\u000a      World Congress, San Juan, Argentina, October 2012). `It was very much\u000a        thanks to Jane's tireless\u000a        advocacy work that the original idea of the CRC underpinning all the\u000a        work of the Welsh\u000a        Government has been taken forward. Her evidence to the Legislation\u000a        Committee in September\u000a        2010 played a crucial role in those efforts.' (Domestic Policy and\u000a      Research Officer, UNICEF UK,\u000a      C9 below).\u000a    International impact\u000a      On-going impact includes promotion of legislative change and programmatic\u000a      reform on children's\u000a      rights at the autonomous regional level, through research collaboration\u000a      between Hoffman and\u000a      Barcelona University. The World Congress on the Rights of Children and\u000a      Adolescents featured the\u000a      Welsh model of incorporation in its 5th biennial congress in Argentina in\u000a      October 2012, with a\u000a      plenary address by Rt. Hon. Rhodri Morgan. Hoffman has been invited to\u000a      serve on the scientific\u000a      committee for the next Congress in Mexico, 2014. UNICEF has promoted\u000a      consideration of the\u000a      Welsh model internationally: `Wales was the first country in the UK to\u000a        adopt a legislative instrument\u000a        of incorporation but the Measure is also unique in the world and has\u000a        attracted a lot of interest. A\u000a        number of governments and UNICEF offices have been following\u000a        developments in Wales and\u000a        using it for their advances in implementing the CRC. For instance,\u000a        UNICEF Canada organised an\u000a        international conference on the Child Rights Impact Assessment in May\u000a        2013 and the Welsh model\u000a        and experience was on the agenda and was discussed in detail and with\u000a        great interest' (Domestic\u000a      Policy and Research Officer, UNICEF UK, C9 below). In September 2011 a\u000a      Scottish Government\u000a      consultation proposed to follow the `due regard' model (C10 below, at\u000a      para. 60).\u000a    On-going impact in Wales\u000a      The `Taking the Rights Steps' conference in June 2012 was part-funded by\u000a      the Welsh Government\u000a      to contribute to implementation of the Measure. The Wales Observatory on\u000a      Human Rights of\u000a      Children and Young People, based in the UoA, was launched at `Taking the\u000a      Rights Steps' and in\u000a      its first year has undertaken training and consultancy on implementation\u000a      of the Measure for the\u000a      National Assembly for Wales and the Children's Commissioner for Wales. It\u000a      is working with local\u000a      NGOs and children's projects as well as developing international research\u000a      links. The Observatory\u000a      has also responded to Welsh Government consultations, with respect to the\u000a      due regard duty, and\u000a      has supported a group of children and young people in contributing to its\u000a      response to the UK Bill of\u000a      Rights Commission's second consultation (Wales Observatory responses, C6\u000a      below). `The\u000a        Observatory continues to play a vital role in making sure that the\u000a        Measure is implemented....The\u000a        work of Jane Williams and Simon Hoffman is crucial in securing that the\u000a        hard-won political victory\u000a        over the Measure is reflected in policy and practice' (Domestic\u000a      Policy and Research Officer,\u000a      UNICEF UK, C9 below)\u000a    Beneficiaries include law-makers, policy advisers and children in Wales\u000a      who will benefit from\u000a      Welsh Ministers' compliance with the due regard duty.

This has included work on (a) the impact of devolution on\u000a    the arrangements for\u000a    UK compliance with the UNCRC, and the applicable legal framework under the\u000a    Government of\u000a    Wales Act 2006; (b) suitable legal and other accountability mechanisms in\u000a    respect of UNCRC\u000a    implementation; and (c) the function of policy networks in this context.\u000a    This has been applied\u000a    research, involving engagement with the Welsh Government, statutory bodies\u000a    and NGOs, coupled\u000a    with comparative analysis of other jurisdictions. It has also been informed\u000a    by membership of the\u000a    Wales UNCRC Monitoring Group which analyses data and opinion to inform its\u000a    non-governmental\u000a    reports and recommendations to the UN treaty monitoring body.\u000a    The research led to the following insights:\u000a    (i) Effective implementation of children's rights requires a variety of\u000a      legal and administrative\u000a      mechanisms to ensure that political and executive decision-makers pay\u000a      proper attention to\u000a      children's rights. National measures must take account of constitutional\u000a      structures, different legal\u000a      systems and arrangements for public service delivery. [R1 and R3 below]\u000a    (ii) Innovative approaches to interpretation are required (including\u000a      development through a body of\u000a      judicial precedent). [R3, R4, R5 and R6 below]\u000a    (iii) Administrative and social structures impact on capacity to respect\u000a      and promote children's\u000a      rights. Non-governmental organisations and alliances have a crucial role\u000a      to play in promoting\u000a      children's rights, supporting rights-based policy and service delivery,\u000a      and facilitating participation\u000a      by children as members of civil society. [R1-R6 below]\u000a    (iv) In Wales, having regard to the legal framework of devolution and the\u000a      policy priorities adopted\u000a      by successive Welsh administrations, a particularly useful mechanism would\u000a      be a legal duty on\u000a      Welsh Ministers and other public officers in Wales to have due regard to\u000a      the UNCRC when\u000a      exercising their functions. This duty should be pervasive, so that\u000a      commitment to children's rights\u000a      becomes as much a part of decision-making as other pervasive themes in\u000a      Welsh government,\u000a      such as equality of opportunity and sustainable development. [R1, R4-R6\u000a      below]\u000a    (v) Many different actors must remain engaged, collaborating where\u000a      appropriate, furthering policy\u000a      development, promoting public awareness and ensuring accountability.

For example, in 2008 the\u000a      YJB published `Assessment, Planning Interventions and Supervision:\u000a        Source Document', to accompany YJB guidance on the `Assessment,\u000a        Planning Interventions and Supervision', citing two criticisms from\u000a      the Swansea work (citing R2 page 93; in YJB 2008 page 12), asserting that\u000a      risk assessment in the YJS has become: too individualised `by focusing\u000a        on individual, family, school and peer group influences and neglecting\u000a        the role of wider structural and socio-political factors.'; and too\u000a      insensitive `to individual, social and temporal differences relating\u000a        to age, gender, ethnicity, socio- economic status, local area, country,\u000a        type of offending...and cultural, political or historical context.'\u000a      Making direct further reference to R2, the YJB encouraged practitioners\u000a      and managers to improve their assessment and intervention practice by\u000a      taking `more account of the social and cultural context of young\u000a        people's lives' (YJB 2008 page 12) and through `the qualitative,\u000a        appreciative investigation of young people's experiences, aspirations'\u000a      (R2 page 102; in YJB 2008 page 49).\u000a    In 2009, Haines and Case's critique of RFR and the application of the\u000a      RFPP in youth justice was published as a monograph under the title `Understanding\u000a        Youth Offending: Risk Factor Research, Policy and Practice' (R1).\u000a      Prior to and post publication we engaged with the Chief Executive of the\u000a      YJB in a series of informal discussions about the findings emerging from\u000a      the research underpinning the book, which precipitated his decision to\u000a      instigate a review of current policy and practice. In an email dated April\u000a      1st, 2010, the Chief Executive of the YJB stated that,\u000a      following his reading of R1, he now believed that `Clearly this is a\u000a      moment to pause and think about the fundamentals that underpin our [YJB]\u000a      approach to assessment'. This was followed in June 2010 with invitations\u000a      to Haines and Case to contribute to a `YJB Seminar' (along with six other\u000a      academics and the Chief Executive, Director of Performance and Director of\u000a      Strategy for the YJB) to explore the future of the YJB's assessment and\u000a      intervention framework. As a consequence, in April 2011, the YJB initiated\u000a      a formal review of the existing assessment and intervention framework for\u000a      the YJS, in which Haines and Case were subsequently invited to\u000a      participate, including reviewing a draft of the YJB's proposals for a new\u000a      assessment and intervention planning framework entitled `Assessment and\u000a        Planning Interventions: review and redesign project. Statement of\u000a        intent: Proposed framework' (YJB 2011).\u000a    Culminating in its new `AssetPlus' assessment and intervention framework\u000a      (YJB, 2011), the YJB proposes to abandon the RFPP and its reliance on RFR.\u000a      In doing so the YJB now rejects the central propositions of RFR that it is\u000a      possible to identify risk factors in the lives of young people and target\u000a      these factors to reduce (re-)offending &#8212; the central critique we advanced\u000a      in R1. To replace the RFPP, the YJB's new framework proposes that\u000a      interventions with young people should be based on, inter alia,\u000a      enhanced levels of engagement with them in assessing their needs and\u000a      aspirations, a clear focus on current life circumstances and interventions\u000a      which are focused on supporting young people in achieving positive future\u000a      outcomes &#8212; the arguments we have advanced in several publications (e.g.\u000a      R1-R6) A letter from the Chief Executive of the YJB to Professor Haines\u000a      (dated June 17th, 2011) stated:\u000a    `The research and publications of Haines and Case ...made a significant\u000a      contribution to the YJB's review of the Scaled Approach. Your critique ...\u000a      was influential in the review process...your research was particularly\u000a      important in highlighting the potential pitfalls of relying over-heavily\u000a      on limited research evidence and in adopting a too deterministic framework\u000a      for youth justice policy and practice...Your research, alongside some\u000a      other key pieces of research, was also extremely informative in re-shaping\u000a      the YJB's new proposed framework for youth justice'.\u000a    A wide range of specific proposals in YJB (2011) can be directly traced\u000a      to outputs from the Swansea research, including: a) the YJB's new emphasis\u000a      on the strengths of young people and on factors which support\/hinder\u000a      desistance from offending, notably `interventions targeted on those\u000a      aspects of young people's lives that promote positive and pro-social\u000a      behaviour', is, in part, drawn from Swansea research, which evidences the\u000a      importance of interventions that enhance enabling factors\/strengths and\u000a      promote positive behaviour (e.g. R1, R3-R6), b) the YJB's recognition that\u000a      there should be a clearer distinction between the identification of need\u000a      and the likelihood of reoffending, such that `need and risk should be\u000a      separately considered and both addressed', draws on our critique of the\u000a      ill-advised conflation of criminogenic needs with welfare needs (e.g. R1,\u000a      R2), c) that the `link between assessed level of risk and the scale and\u000a      nature of intervention [is] too prescriptive' is based on Swansea research\u000a      which demonstrates the methodological weaknesses of a wide corpus of RFR\u000a      and the inability of RFR to demonstrate causal linkages between risks and\u000a      offending (R1), d) the need for `redefining and clarifying the notion of\u000a      `risk'' follows from Swansea research which has provided a critique of the\u000a      definitional ambiguities surrounding the conception and measurement of\u000a      risk and how this produces a false confidence in the validity of empirical\u000a      research evidence from RFR (e.g. R1, R2), e) recognition that `the `one\u000a      size fits all' approach is too restricted and greater flexibility in the\u000a      assessment process is required' and `the range of risk factors included in\u000a      Asset and the Scaled Approach are overly limited and that\u000a      non-individualised factors should be taken into account', draws on Swansea\u000a      research which has evidenced the consequences of the overly-prescriptive,\u000a      inflexible, psycho-social, aggregated and decontextualized approach to\u000a      assessment and intervention pursued within RFR and by the YJS (e.g. R1,\u000a      R2, R5; see also Case 2010), and f) the need for assessments of young\u000a      people which are far more iterative and dynamic than at present, offering\u000a      `greater scope for professional judgment and assessment', such that\u000a      `assessments and interventions should be.. part of a dynamic process' and\u000a      a `greater recognition of the importance of the views of young people' in\u000a      the assessment and planning process, draws on Swansea research which has\u000a      evidenced the value of increasing practitioner discretion and in assessing\u000a      young people in a more holistic, contextualized and qualitative manner\u000a      based, in part, on enhanced participation by and engagement of young\u000a      people (e.g. R1, R2).\u000a    The YJB's `Assessment and Planning Interventions: review and redesign\u000a        project. Statement of intent: Proposed framework' (YJB 2011), now\u000a      named `AssetPlus', rejects the over-reliance on RFR and notions of risk\u000a      that have hitherto dominated youth justice policy and practice. In its\u000a      place a new framework focused on individualisation and promoting positive\u000a      behaviour based on future oriented objectives has been proposed. Swansea\u000a      research has been instrumental in bringing about both of the above\u000a      changes. The YJB's proposal and the case for change has been accepted by\u000a      Ministers and the Ministry of Justice (in June 2012) and on 28\/02\/2013 the\u000a      YJB announced formal Cabinet Office approval for `AssetPlus'\u000a      implementation in YOSs &#8212; piloting commencing in March 2013. When fully\u000a      implemented, the new framework and AssetPlus will radically change the\u000a      orientation of the work of staff in Youth Offending Services across\u000a      England and Wales, and will significantly alter interventions with the\u000a      approximately 50,000 (59,335 young people were sentenced in 2011\/12) young\u000a      people who enter the YJS every year, bringing about a shift away from\u000a      retrospective risk onto a clear focus on enhancing positive outcomes for\u000a      young people.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research and critical analysis by Swansea researchers Haines and Case has\u000a      challenged the methodological basis and policy consequences of widely\u000a      accepted approaches to risk factor research (RFR) and the risk factor\u000a      prevention paradigm (RFPP) in youth justice, and has led to fundamental\u000a      changes of direction and emphasis in youth justice policy and practice.\u000a      The work precipitated a review of assessment and intervention planning in\u000a      youth justice by the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales (YJB),\u000a      provided evidence which has led the YJB to abandon `risk' as the central\u000a      animator of youth justice policy and practice, and provided further\u000a      evidence which underpins the YJB's new `AssetPlus' framework for\u000a      assessment and intervention planning in youth justice.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    Swansea University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Swansea University","InstitutionName":"Swansea University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Wales","UKPRN":10007855}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    Swansea authors given in bold.\u000a    \u000aR1.

In addition to the work of\u000a      others, our research has made distinctive contributions in three main\u000a      areas:\u000a    1) Adding to the broader critique of RFR: by exploring the\u000a      potential for the existence of protective and\/or enabling factors and the\u000a      nature of the relationship (if any) between risk factors and protective\u000a      factors, and by addressing the extent to which RFR can be used to inform\u000a      strategy and policy (as opposed to individual interventions) (e.g. outputs\u000a      R2, R3 and R4);\u000a    2) Conducting our own RFR and offering a distinctive contribution to\u000a        the field: by engaging young people in questionnaire design,\u000a      empirically investigating and analysing the role of protective and\u000a      enabling\/positive factors and their relationship to risk factors,\u000a      exploring contextual influences on the production, negotiation and\u000a      interpretation of risks, eliciting young people's voices in terms of\u000a      constructing their own lived experiences of risks (e.g. R6);\u000a    3) Conducting the first systematic methodological critique of\u000a        international RFR studies, evidencing:\u000a    a) an over-reliance on a restricted, partial and over-simplified\u000a      evidence-base;\u000a    b) excessive determinism in explaining and responding to youth offending,\u000a      reliance on imputed and invalid extrapolations of basic data\/evidence to\u000a      (mis)inform and (mis)guide narrow risk-based policy and practice;\u000a    c) utilisation of ambiguous and ill-defined conceptions of `risk' and\u000a      `offending', such that the nature of the risk-offending relationship is\u000a      poorly understood and insufficiently specified;\u000a    d) excessive use of restricted and crude measurement scales that: i) fail\u000a      to capture the realities of young peoples' lives and ii) readily permit\u000a      erroneous statistical correlations;\u000a    e) insensitivity to the dynamic and contextualised nature of youth\u000a      offending by employing individualised, aggregated and temporally- and\u000a      conceptually-fixed measurements of risk;\u000a    f) underplaying of the importance and utility of the views and\u000a      perceptions of young people and over emphasis on adult-prescribed\u000a      developmental understandings of risk that characterise young people as\u000a      passive and helpless recipients of the detrimental effects of exposure to\u000a      risk, and failure to distinguish between (crime-related) risks and\u000a      (welfare-related) needs when assessing young people's lives and planning\u000a      responsive interventions;\u000a    g) a lack of sufficient focus on desistance, strengths and promoting\u000a      positive behaviour in preference to pursuing more negative and\u000a      deficit-based understandings of young people's lives;\u000a    h) excessive generalisation and over-imputation of the link between risk\u000a      and offending (often based on inadequate &#8212; cross sectional &#8212; research) and\u000a      inadequate criticality in the interpretation of RFR and its translation\u000a      into policy (e.g. R1).\u000a    RFR and its application in youth justice policy and practice has long\u000a      been the subject of academic critique, but Swansea research has had the\u000a      distinctive features noted above.

Since its elaboration\u000d\u000a      in 1997 in a major paper\u000d\u000a      in a leading US journal [1], Walker's key theme of\u000d\u000a      `constitutionalism' has been developed within\u000d\u000a      more specific studies published in prime UK law journals [2].\u000d\u000a      'Constitutionalism' is the collection of\u000d\u000a      values which foster state legitimacy in extreme situations, principally\u000d\u000a      comprising transparency and\u000d\u000a      legality; effectiveness and accountability; and enhanced respect for\u000d\u000a      individual rights.

The\u000d\u000a      grant enabled the further development of contacts with senior police\u000d\u000a      officers, policy-makers,\u000d\u000a      lawyers, and judges. The outcomes of the fellowship are reflected in a\u000d\u000a      major monograph [3].\u000d\u000a    The subject matter of the research ranges from issues affecting terrorism\u000d\u000a      suspects, for example\u000d\u000a      the nature of interrogation regimes and the length of police detention\u000d\u000a      periods, through to collective\u000d\u000a      security of systems and installations within the Critical National\u000d\u000a      Infrastructure i.e. essential\u000d\u000a      facilities and services. The research has been deepened and its scope\u000d\u000a      extended following the\u000d\u000a      rapid and substantial growth of laws since September 11, 2001. The\u000d\u000a      critique of legal\u000d\u000a      developments, such as an analysis of three seminal House of Lords\u000d\u000a      judgments issued in 2007\u000d\u000a      and concerning control orders [4], has involved recommendations\u000d\u000a      that influenced reviewers of\u000d\u000a      that system. Field research into the practices of police and prison\u000d\u000a      governors [5], undertaken\u000d\u000a      amidst participation in policy debates and Parliamentary scrutiny of the\u000d\u000a      Counter-Terrorism Act\u000d\u000a      2008, has also led to concrete recommendations, for example, around\u000d\u000a      post-charge questioning.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6365","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research had impact, by influencing and changing policy and\u000a      professional practice, in three main areas:\u000a    (i) The organisation of community safety practices and the\u000a        coordination of the `extended policing family' across the UK: The\u000a      research influenced professional practices via: The establishment of\u000a      `Plural Policing' units in police forces to coordinate and harness the\u000a      diverse efforts of the `extended policing family'; the promotion and\u000a      emergence of formal partnerships between the police and non-police\u000a      providers of neighbourhood security; and greater recognition of the\u000a      contribution of PCSOs to delivering public reassurance, crime prevention\u000a      and problem-solving [A] [B] [C]. The report of the study\u000a      commissioned by West Yorkshire Police Authority directly influenced the\u000a      long-term deployment of PCSOs in West Yorkshire and (by 2009) over 300\u000a      copies hafsd been sold to all 43 police forces in England and Wales. The\u000a      findings enabled police managers to protect PCSOs from budget cuts\u000a      (notably since the Comprehensive Spending Review 2010) and keep the PCSO\u000a      role focused on public reassurance, crime prevention and core community\u000a      safety activities. The Chair of the National Community Safety Network has\u000a      testified: \"This work has been immensely useful in informing the\u000a      development of community safety in England and Wales and in particular\u000a      supporting local work to integrate partners into an extended policing\u000a      family... [it] has helped some forces to secure the continuation of PCSOs\u000a      and has shaped a number of localised partnerships where co-ordinated\u000a      tasking of private security providers and local authority enforcement\u000a      officers has resulted in improved quality of life for communities\" [D].\u000a      Recently, insights from the research have informed the conclusions of the\u000a      Independent Commission on the Future of Policing (Chaired by Lord Stevens,\u000a      2012-13 [A]).\u000a    (ii) The use of police dispersal powers designed to tackle anti-social\u000a        behaviour and promote community safety: The research significantly\u000a      improved the quality of the evidence-base on dispersal orders, resulting\u000a      directly in changes to the policies and practices of police forces and\u000a      community safety partnerships around the UK. According to the then Chief\u000a      Executive of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA): \"the\u000a      research directly informed the NPIA's guidance and policy development.\u000a      Policy and operational practice was directly affected by the research\u000a      through links between the researchers and the NPIA team\" [E]. In\u000a      some areas, it led to long-term partnership planning and problem-solving\u000a      initiatives being triggered alongside the introduction of dispersal\u000a      powers. Programme Managers at the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust (JRHT)\u000a      verified that the research had practice-based impact: \"Directly affecting\u000a      JRHT's behaviour as a social landlord through them taking an approach\u000a      based on philosophy (rather than uniformed patrols) when confronted with\u000a      behaviour seen as problematic\" [F].\u000a    (iii) National policy and public debate concerning the nature and\u000a        availability of specific anti- social behaviour powers: The research\u000a      highlighted considerable public uncertainty over the role of PCSOs and\u000a      also the powers available to them, findings that generated much media\u000a      coverage (i.e. The Daily Mail and Economist) and political\u000a      concern about the uneven powers, training and uniforms of PCSOs. Sir Ian\u000a      Blair, the architect of PCSOs, confirmed: \"evaluation has proved they\u000a      [PCSOs] are successful... as the `eyes and ears' of the service... But\u000a      this is not totally true of other studies, such as that carried out last\u000a      year by Adam Crawford and Stuart Lister at the University of Leeds. The\u000a      study, research for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, found that there was\u000a      public confusion over the roles of [P]CSOs and what could be expected of\u000a      them when it comes to tackling crime\" (Interview, Police Federation\u000a        Magazine, p.13). Consequently, in 2008 the NPIA undertook a\u000a          wide-ranging review of the role which led the Government to\u000a          standardise a menu of powers for PCSOs. Subsequently, work has been\u000a          on-going to standardise supervision, training and uniforms. The\u000a          ex-NPIA Chief Executive wrote in testimony: \"The research was very\u000a          significant in Ministerial policy development and led directly to the\u000a          NPIA's work to develop a standard set of powers, supervision, training\u000a          and uniform for PCSOs\" [E].\u000a    The research influenced responses to the Coalition Government's\u000a          consultation and review of anti- social behaviour powers and informed\u000a          the publication of the subsequent White Paper (2012). It was heavily\u000a          cited in the submission by the Independent Commission on Youth Crime\u000a          and Anti- Social Behaviour to the Government's consultation [G]\u000a            [H]. The Secretary to the Independent Commission acknowledged:\u000a          \"the influence of Crawford and Lister's research on the Government's\u000a          proposed reform of dispersal powers is clear. Their research has also,\u000a          as evidenced by its contribution to the Commission's work, played an\u000a          important part in critical public debate\" [H]. Specifically,\u000a          the White Paper accepted the findings regarding the anomaly of\u000a          `presence' as a ground for dispersal and proposed that: \"The new power\u000a          would also be dependent on actual behaviour, rather than an\u000a          individual's presence in a particular area\". This is reflected in the\u000a          draft Anti-Social Behaviour Bill published in December 2012 [I].\u000a          The Metropolitan Police Anti-social Behaviour Coordinator for Camden\u000a          and adviser to the government on the current legislation, stated: \"For\u000a          me the most important factor to note when faced with academic\u000a          findings\/research is whether it changes or influences one's own\u000a          views\/beliefs; in relation to Adam and Stuart's work the answer is\u000a          yes\" [J].\u000a        ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Improvements in the organisation and delivery of community safety by\u000a      police and local authority-led partnerships have resulted from\u000a      inter-related research studies conducted by a team at the Centre for\u000a      Criminal Justice Studies.

Local councils and police have acquired\u000a      legal responsibility for community safety, whilst the size of the private\u000a      security industry and its contribution to policing have both increased\u000a      significantly. The Police Reform Act 2002 introduced police community\u000a      support officers (PCSOs), second-tier police employees with limited powers\u000a      and training. There has also been an increase in an assortment of public,\u000a      private and municipal policing actors, including neighbourhood and street\u000a      wardens. These `plural' forms of policing raise fundamental policy and\u000a      practice questions concerning the organisation, delivery and governance of\u000a      policing partnerships. Moreover, there has been a rapid expansion of\u000a      police powers and the introduction of civil sanctions designed to tackle\u000a      low-level anti-social behaviour. Specifically, the dispersal order,\u000a      introduced by the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003, provides police with\u000a      powers to disperse groups in designated areas.\u000a    A series of linked externally-funded research studies conducted between\u000a      2003 and 2012 has explored the impact, effectiveness and best use of the\u000a      new personnel and powers, as well as how plural policing partnerships can\u000a      enhance community safety. The research was led by Professor Adam\u000a        Crawford (Professor at Leeds since 2000 where he has been employed\u000a      since 1993) and Stuart Lister (Research Officer, Lecturer and then\u000a      Senior Lecturer at Leeds since 2001). The studies, funded by the Nuffield\u000a      Foundation and Joseph Rowntree Foundation, embedded engagement with\u000a      research users from the outset. They were overseen and informed by\u000a      advisory boards comprising key national practitioners and policy-makers.\u000a      User engagement was enhanced by an ESRC research seminar series `Governing\u000a      Through Anti-Social Behaviour' (see below) in collaboration with the\u000a      National Community Safety Network, the professional association of\u000a      community safety practitioners.\u000a    The research identified the frequently disparate nature of relations\u000a      between different agencies providing policing, highlighting a lack of\u000a      coordination and the need to harness and regulate their diverse efforts\u000a      through partnerships [1-3]. Accordingly, it recommended the\u000a      introduction of institutional means for the police to engage better with\u000a      the `extended policing family', for example, by setting up force-wide\u000a      strategic units. It highlighted the benefits of pursuing `problem-solving'\u000a      approaches to tackling neighbourhood disorder, which mobilise the\u000a      expertise and resources of local communities and partner agencies [4-5].\u000a      It also demonstrated the positive contribution to and limitations of PCSOs\u000a      in regard to crime prevention and public reassurance [1]. It\u000a      recommended greater public awareness and standardisation of PCSOs' powers\u000a      and uniforms to address the significant problem of public confusion and\u000a      uncertainty over what PCSOs can actually do.\u000a    A key recommendation of the study of dispersal orders was `to amend the\u000a      existing law such that dispersal powers apply only to the behaviour\u000a      of groups rather than merely their presence' as this `would align\u000a      the law more closely with current police practice, remove considerable\u000a      public confusion over the scope of the powers and reduce current\u000a      perceptions that whole groups of young people are targeted by dispersal\u000a      orders regardless of their actual behaviour' [4: 75]. It also\u000a      presented evidence to support the practice of dispersal powers being used\u000a      as a trigger for wider, long-term strategic planning through multi-agency\u000a      partnerships and community engagement about the causes of local social\u000a      problems.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6366","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"597427","Name":"Lithuania"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    (i) Shaping the EU System for Tracking Implementation of\u000a          the Disability Convention The research described in Section 2\u000a      and reported in [1] was initiated by a request to ANED from the\u000a      European Commission. ANED, which is funded by the Commission, was\u000a      established to conduct policy-relevant research and provide the Commission\u000a      with an evidence base for its legislative and policy-making activities in\u000a      the disability field. It is co-ordinated by Leeds' interdisciplinary\u000a      Centre for Disability Studies in partnership with a Dutch management\u000a      consultancy firm. Priestley has been its scientific director since 2007,\u000a      since which time Lawson has also been a member of its\u000a      co-ordinating research team. The Commission was regularly updated on the\u000a      progress of Lawson and Priestley's research on disability-rights\u000a      monitoring (described in Section 2) and provided with reports subsequently\u000a      published on the ANED website. The impact of the research was thus\u000a      grounded on a strategic partnership between the researchers and the\u000a      research- users.\u000a    In 2010 the European Commission adopted a strategy to guide its work for\u000a      the next decade - the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. This\u000a      includes an express commitment to adopt the monitoring approach developed\u000a      by Lawson and Priestley as the \"general principles for monitoring\u000a      and evaluating the Strategy\" [A, page 40].\u000a    In addition, the Strategy set out plans for building on the\u000a      recommendations of Lawson and Priestley by developing an online\u000a      tool to assist in monitoring disability policy instruments in the 34 ANED\u000a      countries [A, pages 55-58]. The online tool was developed\u000a      by ANED and, after consultation with the EU High Level Group of States\u000a      representatives in the disability field, launched in 2012 as the\u000a      `Disability Online Tool of the Commission' (DOTCOM) [B].\u000a    DOTCOM is a publicly accessible database which is regularly updated by\u000a      ANED members and contains more than 1,500 entries. It includes indicators\u000a      of rights in law and policy, broadly based on those suggested by Lawson\u000a      and Priestley and described in Section 2. Currently, however, the\u000a      statistical indicators are reported separately on the ANED website.\u000a      Against each of the 43 DOTCOM indicators, information is made available in\u000a      DOTCOM for each of ANED's 34 countries and also for the EU-level about the\u000a      existence, content and location (through web links) of any relevant law or\u000a      policy. Searches may be conducted by indicator or by country. DOTCOM thus\u000a      equips EU and national policy-makers, researchers, disability-rights\u000a      campaigners, and others with a convenient means of locating information\u000a      essential for mutual learning and for tracking progress towards\u000a      implementation of disability rights.\u000a    The Head of the Disability Unit in the European Commission, confirming\u000a      the impact of the research described in Section 2 on the Commission's\u000a      disability policy development, observed that: \"In particular, ANED's work\u000a      on data collection and dissemination as well as the development of\u000a      relevant indicators has strengthened our approach to disability rights\u000a      monitoring\" [C]. In 2012 the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights\u000a      (FRA) began working on disability-rights monitoring and data collection.\u000a      The research carried out by Lawson and Priestley for ANED has\u000a      shaped FRA's approach to this task. In the words of FRA's Head of Equality\u000a      and Citizens' Rights Department, it has made an `important contribution'\u000a      to the development of the Agency's data collection strategy in the\u000a      disability field' [D].\u000a    (ii) Strengthening the Council of Europe's Recommendation\u000a          on Political Participation\u000a    In 2009 the CoE established a sub-committee - the Committee of Experts on\u000a      the Participation of People with Disabilities in Political and Public Life\u000a      (CAHPAH-PPL) - to evaluate and promote the participation of persons with\u000a      disabilities in political and public life. In March 2011 Lawson\u000a      attended a meeting to advise CAHPAH-PPL. She presented her research on the\u000a      equality and accessibility obligations of the Disability Convention [2-5],\u000a      and their implications for the particular policy domain of political\u000a      participation. She explained her research finding that compliance with the\u000a      Disability Convention requires action to ensure that disabled people are\u000a      not prevented from voting by discriminatory laws (including laws denying\u000a      voting rights to people with mental disabilities on the basis of a court\u000a      ruling or loss of legal capacity). She also used her research to\u000a      demonstrate that the Disability Convention requires the progressive\u000a      dismantling of accessibility barriers (e.g. in physical structures and\u000a      information) associated with voting and elections.\u000a    The Committee agreed to take account of Lawson's research and\u000a      advice, as is indicated in the following quote from the minutes: \"The\u000a      Committee ... decided to take account of her comments and opinions when\u000a      drawing up recommendations.\" [E].\u000a    Committee members agreed that a draft Recommendation should include\u000a      strong provisions on improving accessibility but there was initial\u000a      reluctance amongst some members to condemn the practice (endorsed by the\u000a      UN Human Rights Committee in 1996) of depriving people with mental\u000a      disabilities of voting rights on the basis of court rulings. However,\u000a      after further discussion, and also lobbying from civil society, CAHPAH-PPL\u000a      drafted a `recommendation' that fully incorporated all of Lawson's\u000a      arguments. This was accepted by CAHPAH-PPL's parent committee, the CoE\u000a      Committee of Experts on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CAHPAH)\u000a      and, on 16 November 2011, it was formally adopted by the CoE's Committee\u000a      of Ministers as `Recommendation CM\/Rec(2011)14 of the Committee of\u000a      Ministers to Member States on the Participation of Persons with\u000a      Disabilities in Political and Public Life'. Since then DOTCOM [B] reveals\u000a      that Lithuania has introduced new accessibility obligations for elections;\u000a      and that the Lithuanian equality ombudsman has issued guidelines on the\u000a      topic.\u000a    According to the then Chair of CAHPAH-PPL [F], Lawson's\u000a      research `helped the Committee to realise the need to have a strong set of\u000a      recommendations that would focus on issues like accessibility and legal\u000a      capacity' and was `of paramount importance to help frame the Committee\u000a      recommendations and to bring consensus to the group of experts'. According\u000a      to the chair of CAHPAH (also then a member of CAHPAH-PPL), Lawson's\u000a      work with CAHPAH-PPL (particularly on the issue of voting rights for\u000a      people with mental disabilities) `led to' the recommendation [G].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Anna Lawson's research into disability equality and human rights\u000a      has shaped and strengthened the disability policy of the European Union\u000a      (EU) and Council of Europe (CoE).\u000a    The research formed the basis of a new EU-wide system for tracking the\u000a      progress being made by 34 countries in implementing the United Nations\u000a      Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006 (Disability\u000a      Convention).\u000a    Lawson's research also shaped the content of a CoE Recommendation (issued\u000a      to its 47 Member States) on the political rights of disabled people.

Its objective was to develop a system for monitoring\u000a      and disseminating the progress being made by countries in the European\u000a      region in implementing the full spectrum of Disability Convention rights -\u000a      thereby enhancing transparency and facilitating the identification of good\u000a      practice. The research was carried out in two phases.\u000a    Phase 1 consisted of a systematic review of disability-rights monitoring\u000a      methods previously used by national governments, the UN and civil society\u000a      organisations. These were evaluated using the `social model' theory of\u000a      disability. The research found that many of these monitoring methods, when\u000a      analysed from this theoretical standpoint, could be criticised for\u000a      focusing on measuring physical or mental impairment at the expense of\u000a      disabling social barriers (e.g. inaccessible built environments and\u000a      information and laws depriving people of the legal capacity to vote or to\u000a      bring a case before a court). Lawson and Priestley found that a\u000a      model of disability-rights monitoring, consistent with social model\u000a      principles, required a focus on the measurement of (1) the existence of\u000a      relevant laws and policies, (2) the extent of accessibility barriers and\u000a      (3) the participation levels of disabled people in mainstream activities\u000a      (such as employment and higher education). They also recommended that data\u000a      used for disability-rights monitoring in multiple countries should be\u000a      disseminated through a publicly available on-line database which supported\u000a      on-going updating and personally-tailored searching.\u000a    In Phase 2, Lawson and Priestley developed their work further in\u000a      consultation with others, including other members of ANED and\u000a      representatives of Eurostat, the World Health Organisation, the Council of\u000a      Europe and Disabled People's International. They identified a set of\u000a      qualitative indicators to measure rights in law and policy. These were\u000a      derived from an analysis of the Disability Convention and were organised\u000a      into six broad categories - personal and family life; choice and control;\u000a      access to goods and services; education and lifelong learning; work and\u000a      employment; and income and poverty. At the same time, another member of\u000a      ANED, Grammenos (Professor at the Centre for European Social and Economic\u000a      Policy, Brussels) developed quantitative indicators to measure\u000a      accessibility barriers and participation levels, taking into account the\u000a      feasibility of populating these indicators with relevant statistical data\u000a      for all EU countries. These quantitative indicators were organised in the\u000a      same way as the qualitative indicators developed by Lawson and\u000a      Priestley and presented in one combined report. By way of illustration,\u000a      under the umbrella of access to goods and services, a rights in law and\u000a      policy indicator was `Providers of financial services are subject to\u000a      accessibility requirements in relation to buildings, information and\u000a      communications'; an accessibility indicator was `Proportion of level\u000a      access accessible public [transport] buses'; and a participation indicator\u000a      was `Regular Internet usage [by disabled people] compared to general\u000a      population'.\u000a    Equalising Access to Political Participation\u000a    Lawson conducted this desk-based research [2-5] between\u000a      2006 and 2011. It consisted of a socio-legal analysis, based on the social\u000a      model theory of disability, of the potential of disability equality and\u000a      human rights law to tackle the socially created disabling barriers which\u000a      affect people with impairments. The research examined the equality and\u000a      accessibility requirements contained in the Disability Convention and\u000a      found that, for most countries, compliance would entail radical legal and\u000a      policy change. It demonstrated that equality and accessibility obligations\u000a      in EU countries, particularly outside the employment field, are patchy,\u000a      inconsistent and often fall a long way short of Disability Convention\u000a      standards [2]. It also found that people with mental disabilities\u000a      are often marginalised in efforts to implement equality and accessibility\u000a      obligations and that particular effort is therefore needed to ensure\u000a      equality for them [3].\u000a    The research addressed equality and accessibility in various policy\u000a      domains, one of which was political participation. Barriers preventing\u000a      people with impairments from voting were identified in [5]. These\u000a      included accessibility barriers, (eg polling stations which are physically\u000a      inaccessible to people with mobility impairments) and legal barriers (e.g.\u000a      statutes depriving people with mental disabilities of the right to vote\u000a      because they are declared incapable by a court or because they are under\u000a      guardianship). Legal barriers were particularly common because in 1996 the\u000a      UN Human Rights Committee (in General Comment 95) stated that laws\u000a      permitting courts to deny voting rights to people with mental disabilities\u000a      were consistent with UN human rights treaty law. Lawson's\u000a      research, however, found that such laws were discriminatory on grounds of\u000a      disability and therefore, she argued, contrary to the Disability\u000a      Convention 2006. She recommended in [5] that access and legal\u000a      barriers to political participation should be addressed through the\u000a      imposition of equality and accessibility obligations and through the\u000a      repeal of discriminatory laws.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8436","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The case study highlights three substantive examples of impact arising\u000a      from the referenced body of research on accountability. While these are\u000a      relevant to the REF period, they arise from long term active engagement\u000a      between the researcher and the audience beyond academe.\u000a    Example one is of significant high level conceptual impact on the\u000a      deliberations of the 2011 House of Commons Public Administration Select\u000a      Committee inquiry, `Smaller Government: what do Ministers do?' The inquiry\u000a      examined ministerial accountability, particularly in the light of the\u000a      government's intention to devolve, wherever possible, responsibility for\u000a      public service delivery to local level. The Committee fully engaged with\u000a      Woodhouse's research as it relates to levels of accountability outlined in\u000a      her book, Ministers and Parliament (1), and developed by her in\u000a      subsequent work. Its report explicitly drew on and cited this research to\u000a      frame its recommendation to the Government for the inclusion of\u000a      `redirectory responsibility' within the Ministerial Code, the document\u000a      which sets out the duties and responsibilities of Ministers. This, it\u000a      believed, would be `a legitimate aspect of ministerial accountability in\u000a      the context of a more decentralised state' (7), allowing accountability at\u000a      local level, the government's aim, while ensuring a line of accountability\u000a      to Parliament through the minister. The refusal of the government to\u000a      implement this recommendation does not detract from the conceptual impact\u000a      of Woodhouse's research on political debate. Over the years, it has made a\u000a      significant contribution to select committee attempts to persuade\u000a      government to clarify and improve the mechanisms by which Parliament can\u000a      hold ministers to account; this specific example demonstrates one such\u000a      contribution (8). A further example is the House of Lords Committee of the\u000a      Constitution's request in 2013 for Woodhouse to appear before it to give\u000a      her views on the workings of the 2006 Inquiries Act (9); she was adviser\u000a      to the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee's inquiry,\u000a      Government by Inquiry, and co-authored its report (10).\u000a    Example two relates to the direct instrumental impact of Woodhouse's\u000a      research on the development of a robust standards regime in the National\u000a      Assembly for Wales whereby its individual members can be held to account\u000a      for their conduct. As a result of her research on accountability and the\u000a      mechanisms by which it could be achieved, Woodhouse was asked by the\u000a      Assembly's Committee for Standards to undertake a review of national and\u000a      international standards regimes and, on that basis, to make\u000a      recommendations on the Assembly's regime. Her report, published in 2001\u000a      (11) (subsequently known as the Woodhouse Review), recommended, inter\u000a        alia, that the office of Commissioner for Standards for the Assembly\u000a      should be placed on a statutory footing and have its responsibilities and\u000a      powers enhanced. Although the Committee for Standards accepted the\u000a      recommendations, the Assembly could not be asked to give them effect as\u000a      the power to do so resided with the Westminster Parliament. The Government\u000a      of Wales Act 2006 changed the situation as it included a provision for the\u000a      creation of a statutory Commissioner by way of an Assembly measure. As a\u000a      result, in March 2009 the Committee (12) proposed a statutory\u000a      Commissioner, as recommended by Woodhouse, which was accepted by the\u000a      Assembly. The first statutory Commissioner took up post on 1 December\u000a      2010.\u000a    Example three illustrates broader international reach and conceptual\u000a      impact. Woodhouse's research on ministerial accountability has been\u000a      regularly cited in Australian debate over many years and continues to\u000a      impact today. A 2007 report to the Prime Minister by the Australian Study\u000a      of Parliament Group (13) explicitly adopted the Woodhouse framework for\u000a      levels of accountability in its recommendations and despite (or because\u000a      of) government's resistance to clarifying the responsibility of ministers\u000a      to Parliament, this framework has continued to feature in debates about\u000a      accountability in Australia. For example, Woodhouse research was used in a\u000a      2008 Australian Parliamentary Paper to illuminate the issues faced by the\u000a      Australian Parliament in holding the government to account (14) and Hear\u000a        Our Voice: The Democracy Australians Want, published in 2012 by the\u000a      Australian Collaboration (a consortium of National Community\u000a      Organisations)(15) explicitly refers to the Woodhouse principles on causal\u000a      and role responsibility and the Woodhouse responsibility framework.\u000a    These examples of Woodhouse's research informing national and\u000a      international debate on accountability and governance show impact as an\u000a      ongoing process extending over a period of time through to the current\u000a      reference period.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Woodhouse's research has conceptual and instrumental impact in the UK and\u000a      internationally.

Woodhouse's 1994 book Ministers\u000a        and Parliament: accountability in theory and practice (1) laid the\u000a      foundation for a corpus of research into the theory and practice of\u000a      accountability which has been demonstrably influential in the UK and\u000a      beyond, with copies of the resultant books being retained in over 300\u000a      libraries worldwide. In Ministers and Parliament Woodhouse\u000a      explored the constitutional convention of individual ministerial\u000a      responsibility, which, inter alia, provides the basis for the\u000a      accountability of Ministers to Parliament, and the divergence between\u000a      theory and practice. She analysed the situations in which ministers\u000a      resign, the effectiveness of resignation as a means of accountability, and\u000a      the mechanisms used by ministers to avoid taking responsibility. Her\u000a      historical analysis was continued in her contribution to `The Constitution\u000a      in the Twentieth Century (4).\u000a    In her work, Woodhouse developed a typology of levels of political\u000a      accountability that relates to the degree of control ministers exercise\u000a      over their responsibilities and is appropriate to modern government. The\u000a      starting point is redirectory responsibility where the requirement\u000a      is simply for ministers to redirect operational questions to officials who\u000a      have delegated responsibility for them (e.g. heads of Executive Agencies)\u000a      while retaining ultimate responsibility for ensuring the questions are\u000a      addressed appropriately. At the second level, informatory\u000a        responsibility, ministers are required to provide Parliament with\u000a      information about what has happened in their areas of responsibility.\u000a      Thereafter, far more is expected of Ministers; explanatory\u000a        accountability requires them to explain or account for their own and\u000a      their departments' actions; amendatory responsibility requires\u000a      them to make amends for their own or their departments' actions; and,\u000a      finally, sacrificial responsibility requires them to resign for\u000a      their own errors and for those of their department in which they were\u000a      involved or of which they knew or should have known.\u000a    Woodhouse also examined the powers and limitations of Parliamentary\u000a      Select Committees as these relate to holding ministers to account, and\u000a      drew comparisons with mechanisms of accountability adopted by other\u000a      countries operating under the Westminster system of government,\u000a      particularly Australia.\u000a    Subsequently, she developed the notions of causal and role responsibility\u000a      (2,5) and looked at accountability from a different angle analysing the\u000a      effect of civil service reform, including the shift towards a public\u000a      management model of administration, on accountability to Parliamentary\u000a      Select Committees; examining the increasing political and public focus on\u000a      the standards of behaviour expected of those in public service and the\u000a      resulting concentration on regulatory mechanisms (including Codes of\u000a      Conduct, Codes of Good Administration, and Ministerial Codes) against\u000a      which politicians and officals could be held accountable; and looking at\u000a      the impact of judicial review on political accountability (3). Her most\u000a      recent work (6) examines minister-civil servants relationships in the\u000a      context of recent governmental changes.\u000a    The breadth and depth of Woodhouse's research and its relevance to\u000a      political actors and commentators in the UK and internationally has\u000a      resulted in it having extensive impact, both before the REF period and\u000a      during it.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9046","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Religious Discrimination:\u000a    The doctrinal legal scholarship on religious discrimination (1,2) led to\u000a      commissioned research by the European Network of Legal Experts in the\u000a      non-discrimination field for the European Commission. This resulted in the\u000a      thematic report \"Religion and Belief in Employment &#8212; Law\"\u000a      published by the European Commission (3). This, together with doctrinal\u000a      work on religion and employment (2), has had considerable and far-reaching\u000a      impact on policy debate in a variety of contexts.\u000a    For example, it is cited in the International Labour Organisation (ILO)\u000a      report on Legal prohibitions against employment discrimination available\u000a      to migrant workers employed in Europe as part of the ILO International\u000a      Migration Programme (7); and in the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u000a      Human Rights Review 2012 (8). It has been widely relied on by non-academic\u000a      commentators such as former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey (9), and\u000a      Joanna &#321;opbowska the Legal Adviser Commission of the Bishops' Conferences\u000a      of the European Community (10). It has also been used by legal\u000a      practitioners such as The Open Society Justice Initiative legal opinion in\u000a      the German appeal hearing in Diakonische Werk Hamburg v. Ms.Fadia. (11)\u000a      and The Church and Society Commission of the Conference of European\u000a      Churches (12).\u000a    Vickers' has also influenced policy on religious equality in Europe\u000a      through direct interaction with policy makers. Her 2008 monograph Religious\u000a        Freedom, Religious Discrimination and the Workplace (2) led to an\u000a      invitation to give the key note speech at a conference of the EU\u000a      FP7-funded RELIGARE project in 2011, and again to contributions to the\u000a      project in 2012 and 2013. This project engaged significantly with policy\u000a      makers at the European Commission, as well as having input from a number\u000a      of different faith groups. It made a number of policy recommendations to\u000a      the EU relating to employment matters, including policy on the duty of\u000a      reasonable accommodation. Vickers also spoke at the European Commission\u000a      Legal Seminar on Approaches to Equality and Non-Discrimination Legislation\u000a      Inside and Outside the EU, October 2011, Brussels (with Prof. Titia\u000a      Loenen, University of Utrecht) on a proportionality approach to religious\u000a      discrimination. Papers were attended by members of the European\u000a      Commission, Government Representatives, and Representatives of Equality\u000a      NGOs from across Europe.\u000a    Doctrinal work on the lack of any proportionality review in the legal\u000a      protection for teachers in faith schools was used as the basis for a\u000a      complaint by the British Humanist Association and National Secular Society\u000a      to the European Commission. The complaint argues that UK law in this area\u000a      infringes the EU Directive 2000\/78(13). The European Commission is\u000a      currently awaiting a response from the UK government to its request for\u000a      information on the issue before considering whether to take infringement\u000a      proceedings against the UK.\u000a    Vickers's work on religious discrimination (2) has also been cited in\u000a      Employment Appeal Tribunal cases on religious discrimination (Grainger\u000a        PLC v Nicolson [2009] UKEAT\/0219\/09.) (14)\u000a    Equality Policy\u000a    Work on equality policy in research careers has had demonstrable and\u000a      direct impact on the content of the Funding Councils Equality Guidance for\u000a      REF 2014. Recommendations formulated from the research on equality and RAE\u000a      2008 (4) were implemented in the REF 2014 guidance (15). The\u000a      recommendations led the Funding Councils and Equality Challenge Unit (ECU)\u000a      to take specific action including the provision of clearer guidance to\u000a      higher education institutions (HEIs) by Equaltiy Challenge Unit (ECU)\u000a      about self-disclosure of personal circumstances and that equality training\u000a      should focus on the REF context. In response, ECU developed a template to\u000a      be used to elicit equality-related personal circumstances and designed\u000a      REF-specific equality training. The research also identified a need for\u000a      greater consistency in the equality guidance issued by panels and\u000a      sub-panels and this has led to the adoption of more consistent rules in\u000a      REF 2014. For example, the distinction between clearly-defined personal\u000a      circumstances that can be dealt by adopting a pro-rata approach and\u000a      complex circumstance where a more flexible approach is taken.\u000a    The impact of this work has also been recognised by those affected by it.\u000a      For instance, Manfredi and Vickers were commissioned to carry out REF\u000a      equality training by the University of Surrey (September 2012) for those\u000a      involved in decision making in the REF 2014.\u000a    Age Discrimination Policies and Training\u000a    Research on age discrimination and retirement policies funded by HEFCE\u000a      has been used extensively in knowledge transfer workshops\/training for HE\u000a      human resources mangers and trade unions representatives. Manfredi and\u000a      Vickers were asked in 2009 by Equality Forward in Scotland to design and\u000a      deliver a workshop based on their research to HR managers in higher and\u000a      further education to help them develop policies and practice in response\u000a      to the 2006 Age Regulations. The research findings have been used directly\u000a      in training sessions for human resources managers (Oxford and London,\u000a      2011), and has been used by solicitors in their briefings and\u000a      presentations to clients on the retirement. Training materials have been\u000a      produced, and a web based good practice guide for the HE sector available\u000a      to the HE sector through the ECU web-site(16).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Vickers and Manfredi has enhanced public and policy\u000a      understanding of equality and diversity issues relating to religious\u000a      belief, age discrimination and equality policies both nationally and\u000a      internationally. Their work on equality has been instrumental in\u000a      developing the equality policy of HEFCE and the equality framework of the\u000a      REF 2014. They have advised human resources managers in relation to age\u000a      equality, demonstrably influencing organisational policy development on\u000a      retirement, through its application in personnel equality training\u000a      programmes for a range or organisations and agencies. Additionally\u000a      research by Vickers on religious equality has assisted conceptual\u000a      understanding and capacity building nationally and within the European\u000a      Union, underpinning legal challenges to government equality legislation.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Oxford Brookes University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford Brookes University","InstitutionName":"Oxford Brookes University","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10004930}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"},{"GeoNamesId":"2911298","Name":"Hamburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2643743","Name":"London"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Her work on the issue establishes a principled basis\u000a      for determining the proper scope of religious freedom at work, and\u000a      considers the interaction of freedom of religion with the right not to be\u000a      discriminated against on grounds of religion. It explores the complexities\u000a      of protecting against religious discrimination, particularly given clashes\u000a      with other rights and freedoms such as employer's economic rights, as well\u000a      as gender and sexual orientation equality. It proposes an approach based\u000a      on proportionality as a way to begin to reconcile conflicts, and considers\u000a      the benefits of a duty of reasonable accommodation of religion at work.\u000a      Her research on the issue involves an assessment of the European\u000a      dimensions on the topic, \"Religion and Belief in Employment &#8212; The EU\u000a        Law\",(3) and advocates the use of a proportionality based approach\u000a      as a way to reconcile different European approaches to religion in the\u000a      workplace. Follow-up research Freedom of Religion and Belief and\u000a        Employment in Faith Schools (2009) (4) considered the employment\u000a      rights of teachers in faith schools in England. This concluded that the\u000a      lack of a proportionality test in the School Standards and Framework Act\u000a      1998 makes it incompatible with the EU Equality Directive 2000\/78.\u000a    Equality in Research Careers: Research on equality and the\u000a      Research Assessment Exercise 2008 (RAE) was undertaken for Equality\u000a      Challenge Unit\/HEFCE in 2009 by Vickers and Manfredi (5). This research\u000a      was commissioned on a competitive basis, and involved document reviews\u000a      from 32 higher education institutions, and interviews with senior staff,\u000a      and main and sub-panel members. Findings confirmed that the selection rate\u000a      of women was lower than that of men in RAE 2008. This was broadly\u000a      consistent with the findings of the HEFCE study (HEFCE 2009\/34). In the\u000a      RAE2008, individual sub-panels provided different equality guidance in\u000a      their panel criteria statements. The research concluded that this was not\u000a      justified by differences in the subject areas, and ambiguity in the\u000a      sub-panel guidance might have led to exclusion of some staff from an RAE.\u000a      The research recommendations included that equality training provision\u000a      should focus on the Research Excellence Framework (REF) and make use of\u000a      case studies to explore the implications of dealing with personal\u000a      circumstances in the process of selecting staff for inclusion. It also\u000a      recommended that there should be greater consistency in the equality\u000a      guidance issued by different panels. These recommendations were\u000a      implemented in the REF 2014 guidance: (para 111 Research Excellence\u000a      Framework Second Consultation on the Assessment and Funding of Research\u000a      (HEFCE 2009).)\u000a    Research on Age Equality and Higher Education (HE): This was\u000a      undertaken in 2008-9 by Vickers and Manfredi as part of the by HEFCE\u000a      project Developing Good Practice in Managing Age Diversity in the HE\u000a        Sector.

These reform proposals were then\u000a      considered by the Ministry of Justice, which engaged in its own\u000a      consultation exercise. As a direct result of his empirical work for the\u000a      Law Commission, Mackay was invited by the Ministry of Justice in 2008 to\u000a      participate in three policy meetings to discuss the revised reform\u000a      proposals for provocation, diminished responsibility and infanticide (a).\u000a      This in turn resulted in a post-consultation report to the consultation\u000a      paper to which Mackay also contributed (b). In 2009, Parliament passed the\u000a      Coroners and Justice Act, which enacts reformed pleas of diminished\u000a      responsibility and `loss of control' but leaves the substance of\u000a      Infanticide intact.

These\u000a      discussions culminated in both topics being included in the Commission's\u000a      10th Programme of Law Reform published in June 2008, which\u000a      refers to Mackay's work being used to assist the Commission in the reform\u000a      process [c]. As a direct result, in 2009 Mackay was commissioned by the\u000a      Law Commission to prepare new empirical studies on both unfitness and\u000a      insanity. Both reports of the completed studies were submitted to the\u000a      Commission. The one on unfitness to plead was published in 2010 in their\u000a      Consultation Paper on that topic where it is drawn on extensively\u000a      throughout [d]. In particular, the findings are heavily relied on by the\u000a      Commission in the Consultation Paper's Impact Assessment [e]. On 10 April\u000a      2013, the Commission published its analysis of the responses it had\u000a      received to its Consultation Paper on Unfitness to Plead, including those\u000a      of Mackay, and confirming that a final report on the topic will be\u000a      published in 2014 (f).\u000a    Mackay's report on the insanity defence was published in 2012 as part of\u000a      the Commission's Scoping Paper on that topic where it and his additional\u000a      research are extensively referred to [g]. In addition Mackay was invited\u000a      to join the Law Commission's working parties on both unfitness to plead\u000a      and insanity. The Law Commission has asked Mackay to update both of his\u000a      empirical studies to further inform the Commission's law reform exercise.\u000a      This research will continue into 2014-15.\u000a    On the 23 July 2013, the Law Commission published a discussion paper on\u000a      \"Criminal Liability: Insanity and Automatism\". Mackay is referred to\u000a      throughout, and his contribution is explicitly acknowledged in Paragraph\u000a      1.85 which states: \"1.85 Professor Ronnie Mackay, a member of our Advisory\u000a      Board, has described our provisional proposals for the reform of the\u000a      insanity defence as \"radical\", and stated that in his view \"a `radical'\u000a      change to the M'Naghten Rules is precisely what is needed\". We agree.\" (j)\u000a    Mackay's broader legal research has led to the introduction of new legal\u000a      tests in 2001 and 2003 for both unfitness to plead and insanity in Jersey\u000a      law. Although the former has resulted in litigation in 2009 in the case of\u000a      Attorney General (for Jersey) v Harding [16 Oct 2009] 2009 JRC 198,\u000a      concern had been expressed about the lack of knowledge amongst Jersey\u000a      legal and medical practitioners relating to these new tests (h). As a\u000a      result, in February 2010 Mackay was invited as a keynote speaker at a\u000a      conference in Jersey entitled \"The Insanity Defences in the Criminal Law\u000a      of Jersey\", which was organised to disseminate and further explore the\u000a      implications of the two new tests. Mackay has further disseminated his\u000a      work by numerous speaking engagements to psychiatrists and lawyers\u000a      explaining and exploring his empirical studies on mental condition\u000a      defences, including the Forensic Group of the Royal College of\u000a      Psychiatrists in Dublin and the Judicial Studies Board for Northern\u000a      Ireland, both in 2010. In addition, Mackay was invited to give a\u000a      presentation on his empirical research as part of the Law Commission's\u000a      conference entitled \"Fitness to Plead: Reforming the Law\" in March 2009.\u000a      On the international front, Mackay gave the 2010 Willis Cunningham\u000a      Memorial Lecture entitled \"Researching and Reforming Insanity in the\u000a      Criminal Law\" at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario in Canada and in\u000a      2011 presented a seminar on the New Zealand Law Commission's Report on the\u000a      Insanity Defence as a visiting scholar at Auckland University Law School\u000a      in New Zealand. In May 2012, Mackay spoke about his research into the\u000a      insanity defence as part of Radio Four's All in the Mind (i).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Much has been written about mental condition defences such as insanity\u000a      and diminished responsibility together with the cognate doctrine of\u000a      unfitness to plead.

Mackay has been Professor of Criminal Policy and Mental Health at De\u000a      Montfort University since 1993. His research in this area stems from his\u000a      monograph entitled Mental Condition Defences in the Criminal Law,\u000a      published in 1995 by Oxford University Press [1]. Since then, Mackay has\u000a      shown through empirical and additional legal analysis how the existing law\u000a      operates in reality.\u000a    The research into the defence of insanity and the doctrine of unfitness\u000a      to plead from 1993 onwards has investigated how both operate in practice\u000a      together with the impact of statutory reform measures. By conducting a\u000a      series of empirical studies into both, Mackay has explored how the legal\u000a      tests are applied by psychiatrists, together with the impact of case\u000a      disposals.\u000a    In 1991, Parliament passed the Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness\u000a      to Plead) Act, which directly addressed inadequacies exposed by Mackay in\u000a      an early empirical study of both unfitness to plead and insanity,\u000a      particularly in relation to the lack of disposal, flexibility and\u000a      additionally, in respect of the former, the fact that there was no\u000a      requirement on the prosecution to test its case against the unfit\u000a      defendant. In order to explore the operation and impact of the 1991 Act,\u000a      Mackay conducted further empirical studies into unfitness to plead and\u000a      insanity funded by ESRC (1993-1997) and the Nuffield Foundation\u000a      (2003-2013) respectively [2]. These studies, while showing a small\u000a      increase in the use of both unfitness and insanity, also demonstrated that\u000a      the legal tests remained problematical [3]. As a result of lobbying the\u000a      Law Commission, both unfitness to plead and the defence of insanity form\u000a      part of its 10th law reform programme. This resulted in Mackay\u000a      being commissioned by the Law Commission in 2009 to conduct new empirical\u000a      studies into both unfitness to plead and the defence of insanity to inform\u000a      its thinking about reform.\u000a    Mackay was earlier commissioned from 2003 to 2004 to conduct two more\u000a      empirical studies by the Law Commission. These studies were in connection\u000a      with the Commission's work on Partial Defences to Murder and concerned the\u000a      pleas of provocation and diminished responsibility [4]. Both studies gave\u000a      a detailed picture of how the law operated in practice. Later the\u000a      Commission's brief was extended to a broader consideration of homicide. As\u000a      part of its work, Mackay was commissioned in 2005 to 2006 to conduct an\u000a      empirical study into Infanticide in order again to inform the Commission\u000a      as to how this offence\/defence was being used. This included a study of\u000a      related diminished-responsibility manslaughters [5].\u000a    With regard to Mackay's more theoretical legal work, he was actively\u000a      involved in litigation on the island of Jersey from 2001 to 2003 where he\u000a      was commissioned to prepare written legal submissions in that\u000a      jurisdiction's first cases dealing with insanity and unfitness to plead\u000a      respectively. In both cases these submissions were considered by the\u000a      Jersey Superior Court and led directly to the court formulating new tests\u000a      for both the defence of insanity and unfitness to plead. Both tests now\u000a      form part of Jersey law. In June 2013 Mackay gave papers at the Keele\u000a      University Medico-legal Seminar on Automatism (a participant in which was\u000a      the Criminal Law Commissioner Professor David Ormerod) and at the\u000a      University of Glasgow School of Law's Gerald Gordon Seminar on Criminal\u000a      Law.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9150","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The primary contribution of Price's research has been its impact on the\u000a      development of national and international policy to address the imbalance\u000a      between the supply and demand for organs and tissues for transplantation.\u000a      His most notable appointment and achievement was his membership of the\u000a      Secretary of State's Organ Donation Taskforce. Following presentation of a\u000a      scoping paper in 2008, David was invited to join the Taskforce as Deputy\u000a      Chair of its Legal Working Group. The contributions of the group\u000a      culminated in Annex C to the Report [1]. This Report, which\u000a      included advice about future UK policy relating to consent to organ\u000a      donation, was accepted subsequently in 2008 by all UK Governments.\u000a    Price's work for the Taskforce involved participation at public political\u000a      deliberative events that were held around the country. Following the\u000a      announcement of The Potential Impact of an Opt Out System for Organ\u000a        Donation in the UK [1] in the House of Commons (17 November 2008\u000a      Column 1WS) the Government made available &#163;4.5 million extra funding (2008\u000a      - 2010). This was used to sponsor a major public awareness campaign to\u000a      increase organ donation rates and in April 2013 it was reported that\u000a      deceased donation rates had risen by 50% since the Government's acceptance\u000a      of the Taskforce's recommendations. The Welsh Assembly considered and\u000a      relied heavily upon the findings of the Report in its deliberations about\u000a      introducing a soft opt-out policy to apply to Wales.\u000a    Price's second notable appointment was to the Nuffield Council on\u000a      Bioethics. The Nuffield Council is the most influential principal medical\u000a      ethics body organisation in the UK. Price contributed to a significant and\u000a      influential Report [2], which has impacted subsequently on policy\u000a      development mainly in the areas of incentives to donation. Significant\u000a      media coverage followed and a range of initiatives such teaching resources\u000a      for schools, which introduces the subject and considers different levels\u000a      of intervention to encourage people to donate. The Council has used\u000a      recommendations from the Report in evidence to the National Assembly for\u000a      Wales Health and Social Care Committee on the Human Transplantation\u000a      (Wales) Bill.\u000a    Price's appointments on Government bodies such as the NHS Blood and\u000a      Transplant and the British Transplantation Society provide further\u000a      evidence of his status and reputation in the field. Price acted as for the\u000a      Donation After Cardiac Death Consensus Meeting [3]. The key outputs and\u000a      contributions of these bodies include: `Donation After Circulatory\u000a        Death' [3] and influential professional development materials [4].\u000a      The Report [3] was included in the National Institute for Health and Care\u000a      Excellence repository `NHS Evidence', which is accessible and used by all\u000a      NHS staff. Price participated in a House of Lords event in 2010 to inform\u000a      parliamentarians of the salient aspects of donation following circulatory\u000a      eath [4]. The Professional Development Programme [5] was rolled out in\u000a      2010 to all NHS transplant professionals, 184 NHS Trust donation ethics\u000a      committees and 194 clinical leads across the UK. The Joint Working Party\u000a      of the British Transplantation Society and the Renal Association in \"UK\u000a      guidelines for Living Donor Kidney Transplantation\" (2011) recognised\u000a      Price's esteem and expertise by referring to his two monographs on\u000a      transplantation.\u000a    Price was actively involved with the production of interdisciplinary\u000a      clinical and policy guidelines for health professionals employed in the\u000a      transplantation and intensive care fields. These guidelines, which\u000a      included in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence\u000a      repository `NHS Evidence' were collaborative efforts of\u000a      clinicians, nurses and policy makers. Price's role as legal\u000a      advisor was to ensure that guidance was premised upon current law and\u000a      ethical principles [6]. The guidelines have been recognised by the British\u000a      Medical Association and the British Heart Foundation.\u000a    Price contributed two sections in the prestigious The New Oxford\u000a        Companion to Law encyclopaedia, which is designed to reach and\u000a      inform the public about complex areas in easily accessible terms [7].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This Case Study describes, inter alia, the late Professor David\u000a      Price's sustained research in the broad field of organ transplantation,\u000a      from which a substantial knowledge base and research expertise was\u000a      developed.

David Price\u000a      worked at DMU for 34 years until his death in 2012, rising through the\u000a      ranks to be appointed Professor of Medical Law in 1997. His research\u000a      provides a balanced appraisal of contentious matters such as presumed\u000a      consent laws, property rights and commercial dealings in body parts [1].\u000a      His work has been recognised by Government, policy makers and Funders, as\u000a      evidenced by his national and international appointments. The research\u000a      that underpins this case study includes analyses of laws and policies,\u000a      empirical work, formulation of policies and strategies, advice and\u000a      guidance to official bodies and collaborative professional development\u000a      activities with transplant-related health professionals.\u000a    The first major project was the European Multicentre Study of\u000a      Transplantation of Organs from Living Donors: the Ethical and Legal\u000a      Dimensions in 1993. This 27-month collaboration with the Department of\u000a      Surgery at the University of Leicester received European Commission\u000a      funding [2]. Price, who was joint grant holder with Peter Donnelly of\u000a      University of Leicester, was Chair of the Project Management Group for two\u000a      years. He interviewed living donors and recipients around Europe, as well\u000a      as politicians, civil servants and transplant clinicians. A survey was\u000a      undertaken to assess donor health and transplant unit screening policies\u000a      followed by analysis and evaluation of European laws and their\u000a      underpinning ethical theories. The Project culminated in a co-authored\u000a      Report for the European Commission: Questioning Attitudes to Living\u000a        Organ Donation (1997).\u000a    On account of his esteem as a researcher Price was invited to join the\u000a      World Health Organisation Task Force on Organ Transplantation (1996). This\u000a      appointment was the impetus for several further invitations to join\u000a      national and international bodies and working parties. His membership of\u000a      these bodies facilitated the dissemination of his research and its impact\u000a      on policy and society. was invited to join the Retained Organs Commission\u000a      working group. The Commission was set up to develop, inter alia, a\u000a      new regulatory regime for organ and tissue retention. His membership\u000a      involved reviewing regulatory structures and advising the Department of\u000a      Health [3].\u000a    Price was a founding member of the European Expert Group on Ethical,\u000a      Legal and Psychosocial Aspects of Transplantation (ELPAT) in 1997. He was\u000a      the external reviewer for the Report on Xenotransplantation (Department of\u000a      Health, 2003) and was Working Group Chair\/core participant for the\u000a      Department of Health Consensus Meeting [4]. He was the lawyer for the NHS\u000a      Blood and Transplant Group on Guidelines for Consent to Organ\u000a      Transplantation [5]. In 2009, he conducted research for the design and\u000a      delivery of the national Professional Development Programme for Organ\u000a      Donation (NHS Blood &amp; Transplant) and delivered a Masterclass at the\u000a      Launch Event in 2010.\u000a    Price's work is continued and developed by several prot&#233;g&#233;s including\u000a      Farrell and Quigley, with whom he collaborated on an ESRC project.

In Canada, it was used in sentencing judgments to\u000a      produce a greater sensitivity to victims` interests. In England and Wales,\u000a      it informed sentencing patterns that increasingly reflect legitimate\u000a      mitigating factors. Its reach is sentencing law and practice in criminal\u000a      cases in these jurisdictions; it has further influence across Canada\u000a      through judicial training. The significance of these changes is\u000a      substantial, and while Roberts` research was one of several contributing\u000a      factors, it is distinguished in the breadth and reliability of its\u000a      results, and in showing judges and policy makers that the public are\u000a      interested in 2017fit` with respect to the seriousness of crimes, but also\u000a      with respect to mitigating factors. The ultimate beneficiaries of these\u000a      changes are the public at large. The path to this impact was through (1)\u000a      arguments of counsel using Roberts` work, (2) judicial notice of and\u000a      reliance on Roberts` findings, (3) the use of his research by NGOs to make\u000a      recommendations, which were then adopted, for its use in judicial\u000a      training, and (4) statutory bodies in England and Wales commissioning\u000a      empirical research by Roberts and revising their sentencing guidelines in\u000a      response to his published findings.\u000a    The impact of the research on Canadian courts is marked. [R2] was\u000a      the sole academic authority cited by the Quebec Court of Appeal in its\u000a      leading judgment of R. v. Cook (2009) which first held\u000a      that VIS constitutes a legitimate aggravating factor at sentencing. In so\u000a      deciding, Hilton, JA said:\u000a    [68] I see no reason in principle why a victim impact statement, however\u000a      it may be prepared or delivered, cannot be used by a trial judge in\u000a      assessing whether any of its contents can constitute aggravating or\u000a      mitigating factors. As Prof. Julian Roberts, a recognized scholar in the\u000a      field of sentencing has recently written, there is no statistical data\u000a      that suggests that doing so increases the severity of sentences.\u000a\u0009  [69] The\u000a      author also notes that it is generally preferable that the offenders hear\u000a      of the consequences of their conduct directly from those who were affected\u000a      by it rather than from a prosecutor, since this has the effect of\u000a      enhancing the possibility of the offender expressing remorse. In such\u000a      circumstances, a sentencing judge is likely to consider the expression of\u000a      remorse as a mitigating factor, thus showing that victim impact statements\u000a      should not be regarded exclusively as a device designed to increase\u000a      sentences. In that respect, they also contribute to the attainment of one\u000a      of the objectives of sentencing described in subsection 718(f) Cr.\u000a        C., namely, the promotion of \"a sense of responsibility in\u000a      offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the\u000a      community\". [C1, paras 68-69]\u000a    This decision set a new and binding precedent on lower courts and has\u000a      been followed by them, and the Cook judgment, and Professor\u000a      Robert`s research, repeatedly re-cited in their decisions. (See, e.g. R\u000a        v Therrien (2012) [C2] ) Other research on this subject by\u000a      Roberts has also been cited by courts in other jurisdictions, including\u000a      Newfoundland and Labrador, to similar effect; for example, [R2] is\u000a      cited in R v Keogh (2011) [C3].\u000a    A second pathway of impact flows from Professor Roberts` role in Canadian\u000a      judicial education. In Canada, the National Judicial Institute (the\u000a      equivalent of the UK Judicial Studies Board) set up a group to construct a\u000a      national curriculum on the use of victim statements at sentencing. Roberts\u000a      was invited to be a member of this group in 2010 and in 2011. Using\u000a      materials from his published research, above, he co-taught three sessions\u000a      with a judge from the Court of Appeal to judges across the country. A\u000a      printed summary of his research findings was also provided to the judges\u000a      as part of the seminar curriculum. The Department of Justice Canada\u000a      retained Roberts to write a review of the relevant case law in the area of\u000a      victims and sentencing for the benefit of legal professionals in Canada.\u000a      The publication [C4] is distributed to legal professionals, and in\u000a      this way the findings reach not only the judiciary but also leading\u000a      counsel and other members of the legal profession. Roberts` research on\u000a      victim impact statements has also been cited as an authority by the Court\u000a      of Appeal in England and Wales [C5].\u000a    The impact of Roberts` public opinion research in England and Wales has\u000a      come through its influence on, and use by, bodies charged with developing\u000a      sentencing guidelines for courts. Until replaced by a new body in 2010,\u000a      the Sentencing Advisory Panel had the role of helping devise\u000a      sentencing guidelines for courts in England and Wales. In an effort to\u000a      ensure that these guidelines reflect community values, the Panel\u000a      commissioned two large- scale research projects, one to document public\u000a      attitudes to sentencing principles and purposes, and the second to\u000a      document public attitudes to sentencing for driving offences resulting in\u000a      death. In collaboration with Professor Mike Hough of Birkbeck, Roberts\u000a      conducted both studies. The findings were published in peer-reviewed\u000a      journals [R5,6] as well as a peer-reviewed collection of essays\u000a      published by Cambridge University Press [R7]. Their substance was\u000a      also made directly available to the Panel. The Panel noted that in order\u000a      to make sure its proposals were aligned with the public it commissioned\u000a      research by Roberts and colleagues. This research thus shaped the\u000a      guidelines relating to the determination of offence seriousness and the\u000a      specific sentencing ranges for driving offences resulting in death.\u000a      The two studies were conducted in 2008-2009. The Panel released its advice\u000a      about sentencing principles for driving offences in 2009 and its\u000a      guidelines on determining seriousness in 2010. Relying on Roberts`\u000a      research, the Panel produced more principled and consistent sentencing,\u000a      and sentencing guidelines that better reflect community values. [C7]\u000a      Courts have a statutory obligation to follow these sentencing guidelines,\u000a      and do so.\u000a    In recognition of his research-based expertise, Roberts was appointed in\u000a      2008 to the Sentencing Commission Working Group headed by Lord Justice\u000a      Gage and in 2010 to the Sentencing Council of England and Wales, a\u000a      statutory body which is headed by the Lord Chief Justice. It issues\u000a      guidelines that are statutorily binding on all courts in England and\u000a      Wales. Roberts is the only academic member of the Council and he was\u000a      re-appointed to the Council for a further term in 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Julian Roberts` work on victim impact and on public attitudes\u000a      towards sentencing produced empirically reliable and theoretically\u000a      sophisticated findings. His victim impact research has been used by\u000a      lawyers and judges across Canada, has been cited with approval by courts\u000a      in Canada and England and Wales, and has formed the basis of a teaching\u000a      module in the national judicial education curriculum in Canada. A second\u000a      strand of his research on public attitudes to sentencing has helped to\u000a      shape sentencing guidelines (sentencing ranges) in England and Wales.\u000a    In Canada and in England and Wales, those charged with sentencing\u000a      offenders are now better informed about the nature of victim impact and\u000a      public attitudes to mitigation. Judges and policy-makers are using this\u000a      research to achieve a closer fit between sentences and community views of\u000a      the seriousness of crimes.

It involved exploring-both empirically\u000a      and theoretically&#8212;the way the sentencing process accommodates input from\u000a      victims and input from the public. Roberts` research demonstrated the\u000a      theoretical relevance of both victim input and community standards.\u000a      Roberts also conducted empirical studies to explore ways in which such\u000a      input could inform the sentencing process.\u000a    Victim Impact Statements (VIS) [see Section 3: R1-4]:\u000a      This phase of the research demonstrates the benefits of, and theoretical\u000a      justification for, considering VIS at sentencing. Its theoretical strand\u000a      generated one of the first principled justifications for using VIS at\u000a      sentencing; its second, empirical, strand, produced a more robust\u000a      understanding of the influence of VIS on victims' welfare. These ideas\u000a      were not unprecedented, but Roberts` research put them on a firmer and\u000a      more evidenced basis. It further showed that allowing victims to depose\u000a      impact statements at sentencing promotes their welfare, and&#8212;contrary to\u000a      what conventional wisdom previously held&#8212;it could also lead to more\u000a      proportionate sentences without prejudicial effects upon the interests of\u000a      offenders. Drawing upon a wide range of case law and meta-analysis of\u000a      research in several jurisdictions, Roberts` work increased confidence in\u000a      the reliability and validity of these findings.\u000a    Public Attitudes to Sentencing [R5-7]:\u000a      This phase of the research involved a sophisticated analysis of opinion\u000a      data using representative samples of the general public. People were asked\u000a      to impose sentences in specific criminal cases, and asked to rate the\u000a      importance of various mitigating and aggravating factors. The research\u000a      uncovered the structure of underlying public attitudes to the seriousness\u000a      of various offences. Surprisingly, it showed a much greater tolerance than\u000a      many had assumed for important mitigating factors at sentencing, even in\u000a      serious personal injury offences. Research into attitudes to sentencing of\u000a      driving offences causing death provided further insight into the degree of\u000a      correspondence between community views and the practice of sentencing for\u000a      high profile offences. The findings provide a much clearer idea of\u000a      how sentences could 2017fit` community values, by establishing how\u000a      perceptions of seriousness and mitigation jointly shape attitudes.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9509","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Zuckerman's research in civil procedure has had impact in three distinct\u000a      ways:\u000a    (1) Zuckerman's argument was taken up and applied by the court in\u000a      relation to service of the claim\u000a      form in both City &amp; General (Holborn) Ltd v Structure Tone Ltd\u000a      [2009] [C3] and Imperial Cancer\u000a        Research Fund v Ove Arup &amp; Partners Ltd [2009] [C4]. In\u000a      these cases, the Court of Appeal\u000a      accepted the principle, advocated by Zuckerman, that even where an\u000a      application for extension of\u000a      time for service of the claim form has been made before the expiry of the\u000a      deadline, permission\u000a      should be granted only where there was good reason for not serving in\u000a      time. These cases built on\u000a      an earlier line of decisions relying on Zuckerman's research: (Hashtroodi\u000a        v Hancock [2004] EWCA\u000a      Civil 652, [17]; Maggs v Marshall [2005] EWHC 200 (QB); Collier\u000a        v Williams [2006] EWCA Civ 20,\u000a      [2007] 1 All ER 991, [85].\u000a    (2) Zuckerman's approach to applications for extension of time made after\u000a      the expiry of the\u000a      limitation period [R2] was adopted by the Court of Appeal in Cecil\u000a        v Bayat [2011] [C5]. The court\u000a      relies very extensively on Zuckerman's research at [77]-[78], and\u000a      at [94]. The matter is\u000a      determined to be not only one of formalities or expectations, but of\u000a      fundamental reasonableness:\u000a    `The matter goes further than that, because, whatever the expectations of\u000a      a defendant who\u000a      bears any relevant limitation period in mind, the fact is that an\u000a      extension of time for service\u000a      does effectively extend the period (primarily a matter of limitation)\u000a      during which a claimant\u000a      can do nothing to bring his litigation formally to the notice of his\u000a      defendant. That larger point\u000a      was the subject matter of another observation of Professor Zuckerman (at\u000a      para 4.134): \"The\u000a      need for placing a time limit on service of the claim form is dictated by\u000a      the need for finality in\u000a      litigation and by the very existence of limitation periods. The period\u000a      allowed for service seeks\u000a      to ensure that the uncertainty of litigation is not unreasonably extended.\u000a      (...)\" [C5, at 78]\u000a    (3) The Civil Procedure Rules Committee revised the CPR in accordance\u000a      with Zuckerman's\u000a      argument in [R1]. The proposal that the court should give higher\u000a      priority to the need to enforce\u000a      rules and court orders was accepted in the Jackson Review of Civil\u000a      Litigation Costs, Final Report,\u000a      2010 [C1], and has been implemented in the revised CPR 3.9 with\u000a      effect from 1 April 2013 [C2].\u000a    Lord Justice Jackson's Review commented as follows on Zuckerman's\u000a      criticism of the\u000a      flawed enforcement of case management timetables [C1, pp.386-387]:\u000a    \"2.1 ... Professor Adrian Zuckerman presented a paper on litigation\u000a      management.\u000a      Professor Zuckerman argued that the courts must deliver judgments within a\u000a      reasonable\u000a      time and at reasonable cost. The courts, like the National Health Service,\u000a      are a public\u000a      service. Their function is to adjudicate disputes with available\u000a      resources. Court users are\u000a      only entitled to their fair share of court resources. At the moment\u000a      judges, following the\u000a      precept of CPR 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 are far too indulgent to litigants in\u000a      default. This causes not\u000a      only delay but also unproductive waste of court resources in dealing with\u000a      the effects of\u000a      litigant failure to meet deadlines. It is only in truly extreme\u000a      circumstances that the courts will\u000a      strike out a party which is in default. Such extreme circumstances are\u000a      exemplified by\u000a      Marine Rescue Technologies Ltd v Burchill [2007] EWHC 1976 (Ch). After\u000a      reviewing the\u000a      tortuous history of that case Professor Zuckerman stated:\u000a    \"By no stretch of the imagination can this be considered an efficient use\u000a      of court resources,\u000a      nor was it fair to other litigants waiting in the queue, nor did it\u000a      provide effective protection to\u000a      the defendant from being unnecessarily subjected to 6 years of futile\u000a      litigation... The main\u000a      responsibility for this state of affairs must be accepted by the Court of\u000a      Appeal. The Court of\u000a      Appeal has steadfastly declined to develop a coherent policy for enforcing\u000a      compliance with\u000a      rules and case management directions. Its refusal to provide leadership in\u000a      this regard is\u000a      nowhere more apparent than in relation to its interpretation of CPR 3.9.\"\u000a    2.2 A little later Professor Zuckerman stated:\u000a      \"Even more corrosive of good management practice is the Court of Appeal's\u000a      inability to\u000a      speak with one voice. The understanding of the overriding objective varies\u000a      greatly amongst\u000a      its judges, with some judges still holding the view that their only duty\u000a      is to decide cases\u000a      according to the facts and the law, no matter how long it takes and how\u000a      much it costs.\u000a      Management standards will not improve unless the Court of Appeal is\u000a      willing to provide\u000a      leadership. To do so it would have to revise its approach to the\u000a      enforcement of compliance\u000a      with case management directions and therefore to the operation of CPR 3.9.\u000a      It would have\u000a      to adopt a policy that gives practical expression to the need to ensure\u000a      that court resources\u000a      are properly utilised. This means, amongst others, that a litigant who has\u000a      failed to take\u000a      advantage of the opportunity of prosecuting his case will not get another\u000a      opportunity, unless\u000a      he has been prevented from doing so by circumstances beyond his control.\"\u000a    2.3 Professor Zuckerman in his oral address (though he did not touch on\u000a      this in his paper)\u000a      commended the approach which is canvassed as one possible way forward in\u000a      PR\u000a      paragraph 43.4.21. He concluded by arguing that the civil justice system\u000a      like all other public\u000a      services must be adequately managed, so as to deliver a satisfactory\u000a      service. He added:\u000a      \"The management task that the court is expected to discharge is relatively\u000a      uncomplicated:\u000a      to ensure that case management directions are implemented as laid down,\u000a      unless a\u000a      change of circumstances demands otherwise. But this simple task requires\u000a      the court to\u000a      abandon its almost religious attachment to the one dimensional\u000a      understanding of justice\u000a      and accept that doing justice means more than delivering a judgment on the\u000a      merits; that\u000a      time and the use of resources are just as significant imperatives of\u000a      justice.\"\u000a    2.4 Unsurprisingly Professor Zuckerman's presentation provoked a measure\u000a      of\u000a      disagreement and lively discussion. One speaker made the point that if the\u000a      court sets an\u000a      unrealistic timetable, as sometimes happens, that encourages a culture of\u000a      noncompliance.\u000a      In a vote at the end of this discussion 32 people agreed with Professor\u000a      Zuckerman's thesis,\u000a      14 disagreed and there were 22 abstentions.\" [C1]\u000a    Zuckerman's argument, summarized above by Lord Justice Jackson,\u000a      ultimately persuaded the\u000a      Rules Committee that \"courts at all levels have become too tolerant of\u000a      delays and non-compliance\u000a      with orders. In so doing, they have lost sight of the damage which the\u000a      culture of delay and non-\u000a      compliance is inflicting upon the civil justice system. The balance\u000a      therefore needs to be redressed.\"\u000a      [C1, p.397]. Relying expressly and directly on Zuckerman's work,\u000a      the Review therefore\u000a      recommended:\u000a    \"86 The courts should be less tolerant than hitherto of unjustified\u000a      delays and breaches of\u000a      orders. This change of emphasis should be signalled by amendment of CPR\u000a      rule 3.9.\" [C1,\u000a        p.469].\u000a    This recommendation was soon taken up in practice. The 2010 Report,\u000a      accepting and relying on\u000a      the evidence in Zuckerman's research, persuaded the Rules Committee to\u000a      revise CPR 3.9 with\u000a      effect from 1 April 2013. The revised CPR [C2] now states:\u000a    \"(1) On an application for relief from any sanction imposed for a failure\u000a      to comply with any\u000a      rule, practice direction or court order, the court will consider all the\u000a      circumstances of the\u000a      case, so as to enable it to deal justly with the application, including\u000a      the need-\u000a    (a) for litigation to be conducted efficiently and at proportionate cost;\u000a      and\u000a    (b) to enforce compliance with rules, practice directions and orders.\"\u000a    This amendment gave legal authority to the argument of Zuckerman's\u000a      research, and restored the\u000a      binding force of case management rules and court orders. The result was to\u000a      reduce a litigant's\u000a      opportunity to inflict delay and cost on another party and on the system.\u000a      The impact of the research\u000a      means significantly improved access to judgment for civil litigants\u000a      throughout England and Wales.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    An extensive body of research by Adrian Zuckerman has resulted in a\u000a      significant improvement in\u000a      the management of civil trials in England and Wales, and therefore to an\u000a      improvement in access to\u000a      justice for litigants. Zuckerman made a sustained argument that litigants\u000a      are entitled only to a fair\u000a        share of court resources, and not to an excessive share. His\u000a      critical defence of this view changed\u000a      the courts' use of their powers under the Civil Procedure Rules 1998\u000a      (CPR), and persuaded the\u000a      Civil Procedure Rules Committee to change the rules themselves, regarding\u000a      sanctions for failure to\u000a      comply with procedural rules and court orders. The result is an important\u000a      move toward the\u000a      approach that Zuckerman has advocated: that parties should not be allowed\u000a      to depart from\u000a      deadlines imposed by rules and court orders unless they could not\u000a      reasonably have complied in\u000a      time, or had good reasons for the default.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Oxford\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[R1] Zuckerman AAS, Zuckerman on Civil Procedure: Principles\u000a        of Practice (2nd edn, Sweet &amp;\u000a      Maxwell 2006 [f.p. 2003]) (esp. chap 4, 10).\u000a    \u000a\u000a[R2] Zuckerman, \"Enforcing compliance with deadlines\", (2004) 23\u000a      Civil Justice Quarterly 231.\u000a    \u000a\u000a[R3] Zuckerman, \"Service of the Claim Form\", (2005) 24 Civil\u000a      Justice Quarterly 401.\u000a    \u000a\u000a[R4] Zuckerman, \"Service of the Claim Form\", (2006) 25 Civil\u000a      Justice Quarterly 127.\u000a    \u000a\u000a[R5] Zuckerman, \"New provisions for service &#8212; A great improvement\u000a      threatened by discretion.\"\u000a      (2009) 27 Civil Justice Quarterly 1.\u000a    \u000a","ResearchSubjectAreas":[{"Level1":"18","Level2":"1","Subject":"Law"}],"Sources":"\u000a    [C1] Lord Justice Jackson, Review of Civil Litigation Costs:\u000a        Final Report (2010)\u000a    [C2] Amendment of CPR 3.9 -Rupert Jackson's note to the Rule\u000a      Committee re Rule 3.9 (second\u000a      draft) [June 2011]\u000a    [C3] City &amp; General (Holborn) Ltd v Structure Tone Ltd,\u000a      18 August 2009, Queen's Bench Division\u000a      (Technology &amp; Construction Court) EWHC 2139 (TCC), [27]\u000a    [C4] Imperial Cancer Research Fund v Ove Arup &amp; Partners\u000a        Ltd, 23 June 2009, Queen's Bench\u000a      Division (Technology &amp; Construction Court) EWHC 1453 (TCC), [9]\u000a    [C5] Cecil v Bayat Court of Appeal (Civil Division),\u000a      [2011] EWCA Civ 135, 18 February 2011\u000a      EWCA Civ 135, [77]-[78], [94]\u000a    \u000a    ","Title":"\u000a    Improving the management of civil litigation, to improve access to\u000a        justice\u000a    ","UKLocation":[],"UKRegion":[{"GeoNamesId":"6269131","Name":"England"},{"GeoNamesId":"2634895","Name":"Wales"}],"UOA":"Law","UnderpinningResearch":"\u000a    The authoritative work on civil procedure, Zuckerman on Civil\u000a        Procedure: Principles of Practice\u000a      [R1] (`Civil Procedure'), provides a coherent and detailed\u000a      account of litigation under the CPR\u000a      system. It explains the purpose of the CPR, how the courts interpret and\u000a      apply the CPR, the\u000a      principles that govern the exercise of judicial discretion, and how judges\u000a      ought to exercise their\u000a      extensive case management powers.\u000a    Adrian Zuckerman, Professor of Civil Procedure at Oxford since 1973,\u000a      argued that the CPR\u000a      introduced a three-dimensional concept of civil justice, which required\u000a      the court to deliver\u000a      judgments that are not only correct but are also reached by a\u000a      process that is efficient and\u000a      expeditious. He showed that this new concept had far-reaching\u000a      implications in practice, because\u000a      the new commitment to efficiency calls for consistent enforcement of\u000a      deadlines and other process\u000a      requirements. In order to prevent litigants from protracting litigation\u000a      unnecessarily, Zuckerman\u000a      argued, the court should refuse to allow parties to depart from deadlines\u000a      imposed by rules and\u000a      court orders unless they could not reasonably have complied in time, or\u000a      had good reasons for the\u000a      default. It is all too tempting for judges, in their role in giving effect\u000a      to the CPR, to conclude or to\u000a      assume that they should do whatever it takes &#8212; and should inflict whatever\u000a      delay or cost may result\u000a      to the parties &#8212; in order to reach the true substantive determination of a\u000a      claim. Civil Procedure\u000a      explains the reasons against this approach: they lie both in the fact that\u000a      a litigant has no right to a\u000a      disproportionate share of the community's resources in the administration\u000a      of civil justice, and also\u000a      in the right of a party in civil litigation to be protected from abuse by\u000a      an adverse party in the\u000a      litigation process. Civil Procedure also argued in particular\u000a      (para 4.145) that an application for\u000a      extension of time made after the expiry of the limitation period should be\u000a      treated with greater\u000a      caution because \"the claimant is effectively asking the court to disturb a\u000a      defendant who is by now\u000a      entitled to assume that his rights can no longer be disputed.\"\u000a    Having set out these principles in Civil Procedure, Zuckerman\u000a      addressed their particular\u000a      implementation in a series of articles in Civil Justice Quarterly\u000a      [R2-5], criticising the judicial\u000a      tendency to tolerate non-compliance with court orders. As one of the\u000a      principal reasons for this\u000a      unfortunate tendency Zuckerman identified the wording of CPR 3.9, which\u000a      set out the\u000a      considerations that the court must take into account when dealing with an\u000a      application to obtain\u000a      relief from sanctions imposed as a result of failure to comply with a\u000a      rule, practice direction or court\u000a      order.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"10465","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Fredman`s early formulation of the four dimensional model, `The Future of\u000d\u000a      Equality in Great Britain` proved convincing to the Equal Opportunities\u000d\u000a      Commission (EOC), which widely disseminated it after 2002, as a basis for\u000d\u000a      the general duties of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) [C7].\u000d\u000a      Even at this stage it had entered the public realm, not only as a\u000d\u000a      theoretical model, but as a source of practical guidance [C4, C5].\u000d\u000a    This was reinforced in 2005 with the establishment of the Discrimination\u000d\u000a      Law Review by the Department of Communities and Local Government, which\u000d\u000a      was tasked with making recommendations for new equality legislation which\u000d\u000a      would cover all protected grounds.

Public\u000d\u000a      bodies have also developed their own internal guidelines, and the four\u000d\u000a      dimensional model of equality is now part of the standard template as\u000d\u000a      issued, for example, by the Thames Valley Police [C3].

It is accepted that the maxim of formal equality that `likes\u000d\u000a      should be treated alike` is not sufficient. Complete equality of outcome\u000d\u000a      is unrealisable. Equality of opportunity, though popular, is vague. In a\u000d\u000a      longstanding programme of research at Oxford, Sandra Fredman FBA (Rhodes\u000d\u000a      Professor of the Laws of the British Commonwealth and the USA) developed a\u000d\u000a      four dimensional model of substantive equality based on doctrinal,\u000d\u000a      theoretical, and comparative work.\u000d\u000a    The first formulation of the model was in Fredman`s 2002 research paper\u000d\u000a      on `The Future of Equality in Britain` (commissioned by the Equal\u000d\u000a      Opportunities Commission (EOC)) [R1]. Drawing on the law and\u000d\u000a      experience of comparable jurisdictions, and on interviews with key\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and stakeholders, the research canvassed various\u000d\u000a      understandings of equality, including `equal treatment`, `equal\u000d\u000a      opportunity`, `equality of results` and `dignity`. It concluded that none\u000d\u000a      of these conceptions alone was able to capture the full complexity of\u000d\u000a      substantive equality. Instead, the research suggested that the aims of\u000d\u000a      equality should be specified in a four dimensional way:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      To break the cycle of disadvantage associated with groups sharing a\u000d\u000a        protected characteristic.\u000d\u000a      To recognise, affirm, and accommodate different identities: here the\u000d\u000a        aim is not to abstract the individual from her\/his identities, but to\u000d\u000a        change the public space to reflect and to respect them.\u000d\u000a      To facilitate full participation in society.\u000d\u000a      To promote respect for the equal dignity and worth of all, redressing\u000d\u000a        stigma, stereotyping, humiliation and violence because of membership of\u000d\u000a        such a group.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In further research Fredman continued to refine the model, both as a\u000d\u000a      theoretical contribution and as an evaluative framework for assessing the\u000d\u000a      equality impact of social programmes, [R2, R3. R6]. A particularly\u000d\u000a      important application of the four dimensional approach has been in the\u000d\u000a      context of `fourth generation` or proactive equality duties [R4, R5,\u000d\u000a        R6]. These duties are innovative in that they require public bodies\u000d\u000a      to take the initiative to promote equality rather than merely provide\u000d\u000a      remedies to individuals in cases where their right not to be discriminated\u000d\u000a      against has been breached. Such duties are particularly challenging in\u000d\u000a      that they require a vision of the ideal of equality to be achieved. The\u000d\u000a      equality duty introduced in 2000 by the Race Relations Amendment Act 2000\u000d\u000a      referred simply to the duty to have due regard to the need to promote\u000d\u000a      `equality of opportunity` and `good relations`, without further defining\u000d\u000a      these terms. This made it difficult to monitor and gave little guidance to\u000d\u000a      public bodies. Professor Fredman argued that the four dimensional approach\u000d\u000a      should be used to articulate more clearly what public bodies should be\u000d\u000a      aspiring towards in order to fulfil their duty [R4]. This was\u000d\u000a      particularly necessary once the duties were broadened to include all\u000d\u000a      protected characteristics. In addition, she showed that this conception of\u000d\u000a      equality makes it possible to facilitate respect for multiple identities\u000d\u000a      and address intersectional discrimination [R5, R7]. Equally\u000d\u000a      importantly, she argued that conflicts between different strands can be\u000d\u000a      resolved by considering whether disadvantage is perpetuated, dignity\u000d\u000a      infringed, or diverse identity ignored. Underlying this was the key value\u000d\u000a      of participation of affected groups in decision-making [R5, R6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11015","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The contribution, impact or benefit\u000d    Research conducted by CISPP (and its predecessors) both alone and in\u000d      collaboration with others contributed directly to policy-making at local\u000d      and national levels.

The number of these\u000d      courts has continued to be increased during the census period and so the\u000d      research continues to have impact.\u000d    Professor Cook retired in 2006, but projects she initiated continued. One\u000d      specific issue identified during the course of conducting research emerged\u000d      in a study of homeless women in Shrewsbury, many of whom, it was\u000d      discovered, were victims of domestic violence from which they had fled.\u000d      This led, in 2010, to an award under the EU Daphne III Funding Programme\u000d      to look into the problem of women rough sleepers. The research was\u000d      presented to the EU Commission in 2012 &#8212; \"Women Rough Sleepers Who Had\u000d      Suffered Domestic Violence\" in Britain, Hungary, Sweden and Spain (Moss\u000d      &amp; Singh 2012). The plight of Women Rough Sleepers across Europe is now\u000d      firmly on the EU agenda.

These further\u000d      awards lead naturally on from the 2012 report and are financing research\u000d      examining the problems, respectively, of:\u000d    a) Children Rough Sleepers who are runaways and homeless, and victims of\u000d      sexual exploitation\/abuse and other violence on the streets and the\u000d      development of knowledge transfer activities that improve services and\u000d      policies to support and protect these vulnerable children; and\u000d    b) How to empower Women Rough Sleepers to protect themselves from\u000d      violence living on the streets (for example; rape, sexual\u000d      abuse\/exploitation) and create an innovative supportive protective\u000d      environment that meets the needs of Women Rough Sleepers and support them\u000d      back into mainstream society and away from violence.\u000d    These latter two research projects are on-going, but demonstrate that\u000d      concern has been aroused in the policy-making circles of the European\u000d      Union.

Lord Hope, who presided over the Supreme\u000d\u000a      Court decision, has recently described the\u000d\u000a      significance of the meaning of s123. His Lordship stated extra-judicially\u000d\u000a      in August 2013 (to the Banking and\u000d\u000a      Financial Services Law Association, Gold Coast, Australia, in a speech\u000d\u000a      entitled A light at the end of the\u000d\u000a        tunnel? &#8212; BNY in the UK Supreme Court) that a: \"clear definition of\u000d\u000a      the expression \"unable to pay its debts\"\u000d\u000a      is, of course, fundamental to any system of corporate insolvency law.\"\u000d\u000a    The explanation of what is arguably the most important definition in\u000d\u000a      insolvency law is impactful in the\u000d\u000a      immediate context of s123. This provides the test for whether or not a\u000d\u000a      company is insolvent which, if\u000d\u000a      satisfied, permits the court to make a winding up order. A possible\u000d\u000a      finding of balance sheet insolvency is a\u000d\u000a      particular concern for large pension funds which may technically fall\u000d\u000a      within s123(2) due to large contingent\u000d\u000a      liabilities and consequently be wound up insolvent even though they are\u000d\u000a      able to pay their debts as they fall\u000d\u000a      due. If the meaning of s123 remained uncertain (as it was after the Court\u000d\u000a      of Appeal decision in Eurosail),\u000d\u000a      such pension funds would remain concerned as to their potential for being\u000d\u000a      wound up insolvent on the basis\u000d\u000a      of large future and contingent debts (that is, the liability to pay\u000d\u000a      pensions in the future). The potential in this\u000d\u000a      context for widespread economic and social disaster cannot be understated.\u000d\u000a    The s123 definition is also incorporated by reference into a number of\u000d\u000a      other important Insolvency Act 1986\u000d\u000a      provisions (e.g. ss 214A, 238, 239 and Schedule B1, para 11). In\u000d\u000a      particular, it is used daily by liquidators and\u000d\u000a      administrators in proving the requirements to attack transactions at an\u000d\u000a      undervalue under s238 and voidable\u000d\u000a      preferences under s239. These are the most commonly used office holder\u000d\u000a      transaction avoidance provisions\u000d\u000a      and bring in millions of pounds per annum into insolvent estates. Without\u000d\u000a      a clear understanding of the\u000d\u000a      meaning of s123, such actions would be made less common and more\u000d\u000a      uncertain.\u000d\u000a    Section 123 is also widely adopted in drafting commercial agreements\u000d\u000a      where it is used as the trigger for\u000d\u000a      default permitting one party to terminate the agreement or to take\u000d\u000a      enforcement action. It was in the context of\u000d\u000a      incorporation into a commercial agreement, governing a complex\u000d\u000a      securitisation transaction entered into by\u000d\u000a      the collapsed Lehman Bros group, that the Eurosail case was\u000d\u000a      fought. The consequence of the Eurosail\u000d\u000a      decision cost the claimant in the case millions of pounds but did have the\u000d\u000a      significant effect of confirming that\u000d\u000a      many other such securitisations (involving many hundreds of millions of\u000d\u000a      pounds) are unlikely to be attacked\u000d\u000a      as being balance sheet insolvent based upon future and contingent\u000d\u000a      liabilities. The Supreme Court\u000d\u000a      interpretation of s123 brings certainty to the solvency status of such\u000d\u000a      widespread and significant investment\u000d\u000a      vehicles.\u000d\u000a    It is highly unusual for the most senior court in the United Kingdom to\u000d\u000a      adopt the work of an academic as\u000d\u000a      setting the scene for its judicial debate and decision making. The impact\u000d\u000a      of the research can be seen from the\u000d\u000a      fact that their Lordships recognised the specialist nature of the research\u000d\u000a      and the practical consequences of it\u000d\u000a      (please see the next section for Lord Hope's description of this process\u000d\u000a      in this specific case).\u000d\u000a    The beneficiaries of the research are lawyers, insolvency practitioners\u000d\u000a      and their respective clients including\u000d\u000a      major pension funds and banks. It is critical to understand the meaning of\u000d\u000a      insolvency in order to advise both\u000d\u000a      businesses which find themselves in difficult financial positions and\u000d\u000a      office holders representing businesses\u000d\u000a      which have already entered a formal insolvency procedure. It is equally\u000d\u000a      critical that parties to commercial\u000d\u000a      agreements (including but not limited to loan agreements) can fully\u000d\u000a      understand the terms being used in those\u000d\u000a      agreements. Certainty in law is important to society generally especially\u000d\u000a      when the law involves such a\u000d\u000a      fundamental concept as the meaning of \"inability to pay debts\".\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The statutory definition of \"insolvency\" involves proving a debtor's\u000d\u000a      \"inability to pay debts.\" In corporate\u000d\u000a      insolvency, this definition is found in s123 Insolvency Act 1986.

His Lordship\u000d\u000a      explained:\u000d\u000a    \"In an article from which Lord Walker was later to say that he had\u000d\u000a        derived great assistance, Dr Peter\u000d\u000a        Walton said that Lord Neuberger's points about reaching the end of the\u000d\u000a        road and putting the shutters up\u000d\u000a        might be seen as rather stretching the wording of section 123(2), and he\u000d\u000a        questioned whether they were\u000d\u000a        sound. He noted that Toulson LJ had chosen rather different language to\u000d\u000a        describe the test. But he said that\u000d\u000a        Toulson LJ had brought uncertainty into his judgment by referring to the\u000d\u000a        making of proper allowance for\u000d\u000a        future and contingent liabilities and pointing out that it was\u000d\u000a        reasonable to expect that, if the liabilities are far\u000d\u000a        in the distance, the task of proving balance sheet insolvency will be\u000d\u000a        that much more difficult.\u000d\u000a    This, said Dr Walton, seemed somewhat vague, and it paid no attention\u000d\u000a        to what was intended by the\u000d\u000a        predecessors of section 123(2). There was a strong argument, he said,\u000d\u000a        that the Insolvency Act 1986 did not\u000d\u000a        change the meaning of \"inability to pay debts\" from that which was given\u000d\u000a        to the phrase by Sir William\u000d\u000a        James VC in 1869, that the court has nothing to do with any question of\u000d\u000a        future liabilities or with the question\u000d\u000a        whether any business that the company might carry on tomorrow or\u000d\u000a        hereafter will be profitable or\u000d\u000a        unprofitable.\u000d\u000a    There was also a strong argument that in assessing future and\u000d\u000a        contingent liabilities for the purposes of\u000d\u000a        balance sheet insolvency the court should consider only the current\u000d\u000a        balance sheet of the company. A present\u000d\u000a        day value can be given to assets and to future and contingent\u000d\u000a        liabilities. After all, if on this approach a\u000d\u000a        company is balance sheet insolvent even though still able to pay its\u000d\u000a        debts as they fall due, the court retains a\u000d\u000a        discretion not to make the order if it thinks that the company should\u000d\u000a        not be wound up.\u000d\u000a    That, then, was the setting for the discussion of this issue in the\u000d\u000a        Supreme Court.\"\u000d\u000a    3. Lord Hope continued in explaining the specialist and practical nature\u000d\u000a      of the underpinning research:\u000d\u000a    \"[T]he references ... by Lord Walker to the assistance that he had\u000d\u000a        derived from Dr Walton's article are\u000d\u000a        themselves of some interest. When I was starting life at the Bar over 40\u000d\u000a        years ago we were firmly told that no\u000d\u000a        reference was to be made to any textbook or article unless the author\u000d\u000a        was dead. This was because it was not\u000d\u000a        until he ... had died that one could be certain this was their last\u000d\u000a        word. Also judges in those days did not like\u000d\u000a        being told what to think by those who were not judges. How things have\u000d\u000a        changed, and how much better we\u000d\u000a        are for it ... But I can say from my own experience that the debt that\u000d\u000a        we owe to the specialist commentators\u000d\u000a        in an area of the law which is so complex, and yet so much in need of\u000d\u000a        being practicable, is very great.\"\u000d\u000a    4. In addition to the Eurosail case itself and the extra-judicial\u000d\u000a      comments of Lord Hope, it is possible to see\u000d\u000a      the relevance of the case (and therefore the research informing it) from\u000d\u000a      considering the number of\u000d\u000a      commentaries made by practitioners about the case, both in law journals\u000d\u000a      and on the websites of large\u000d\u000a      commercial solicitors' firms.

Walton has been\u000d\u000a      an academic at the University of\u000d\u000a      Wolverhampton for 25 years. The research in question took place during the\u000d\u000a      REF census period, specifically\u000d\u000a      during the Summer and Autumn of 2011. Walton carried out an in-depth\u000d\u000a      doctrinal and historical analysis of\u000d\u000a      the statutory meaning of \"inability to pay debts\". The research activity\u000d\u000a      involved two research trips to the\u000d\u000a      Bodleian Library (to locate and consider mostly nineteenth century texts),\u000d\u000a      searching Hansard online and\u000d\u000a      reading cases and legislation. The research issue had been suggested to\u000d\u000a      Walton by Stephen Davies QC at the\u000d\u000a      Insolvency Lawyers' Association Academic Colloquium in Spring 2011 as an\u000d\u000a      important practical matter\u000d\u000a      which would benefit from full academic analysis.\u000d\u000a    Prior to the research, no academic or court had fully considered the\u000d\u000a      judicial and Parliamentary development\u000d\u000a      of this important statutory definition. The Court of Appeal's 2011\u000d\u000a      decision in Eurosail ([2011] EWCA Civ\u000d\u000a      227) was based upon a number of misconceptions as to how and why the law\u000d\u000a      had developed in the way it\u000d\u000a      did. The Court of Appeal's decision on the meaning of \"balance sheet\"\u000d\u000a      insolvency (defined in s123(2)), that\u000d\u000a      a company was only unable to pay its debts once it had reached the \"point\u000d\u000a      of no return\" was shown by the\u000d\u000a      research to be erroneous.\u000d\u000a    Until recent times it was widely assumed that where a company's\u000d\u000a      liabilities outweighed its assets, it was\u000d\u000a      balance sheet insolvent. The problem faced by the courts in the period\u000d\u000a      following the Insolvency Act 1986,\u000d\u000a      and specifically in Eurosail, arose when the courts were asked to\u000d\u000a      take account of \"contingent and prospective\u000d\u000a      liabilities\" in assessing balance sheet insolvency under section 123(2).\u000d\u000a      The Court of Appeal's understanding\u000d\u000a      of the history and effect of this phrase led it into error.\u000d\u000a    The explanation provided by the underpinning research showed how\u000d\u000a      contingent and prospective liabilities\u000d\u000a      are to be taken into account when assessing balance sheet insolvency (and\u000d\u000a      indeed \"cash flow\" insolvency\u000d\u000a      under section 123(1)(e)). For example, the historical background to the\u000d\u000a      statutory definition was explored and\u000d\u000a      explained, beginning with the law up to and including the critical case of\u000d\u000a      Re European Life Assurance\u000d\u000a        Society (1869-70) LR 9 Eq 122, the effect of which was to lead to a\u000d\u000a      new definition of insolvency for\u000d\u000a      insurance companies only in the Life Assurance Companies Act 1870. The\u000d\u000a      link between the 1870 definition,\u000d\u000a      through the Loreburn Committee Report (1906 Cd 3052) to the wording of the\u000d\u000a      Companies Acts 1907 was\u000d\u000a      identified by the research (and referred to by the Supreme Court at para\u000d\u000a      29 of Lord Walker's judgment). The\u000d\u000a      research explained that the1907 wording remained essentially unchanged up\u000d\u000a      to, and including, section 518\u000d\u000a      Companies Act 1985. Its wording then underwent some changes in becoming\u000d\u000a      section 123 Insolvency Act\u000d\u000a      1986.\u000d\u000a    It was this change in wording that permitted some courts of first\u000d\u000a      instance and the Court of Appeal in\u000d\u000a      Eurosail, to decide that the new wording must mean something\u000d\u000a      different to the old wording. The\u000d\u000a      underpinning research showed clearly that Parliament's intention had been\u000d\u000a      to clarify the previous wording's\u000d\u000a      meaning and not to change it. The crucial Parliamentary statement relevant\u000d\u000a      to this point had not been\u000d\u000a      identified by the Court of Appeal but the Supreme Court repeated the\u000d\u000a      quotation uncovered by the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research and relied upon it in reaching its conclusions.\u000d\u000a    The research is published in a high quality law journal. The research was\u000d\u000a      relied upon by counsel (Gabriel\u000d\u000a      Moss QC and Richard Fisher) for the appellants in the Eurosail\u000d\u000a      hearing before the Supreme Court. Counsel\u000d\u000a      included the article in the Supreme Court trial bundle.

The 2009 reform clarifies the basis and narrows the\u000a      scope of the provocation defence, a `partial' defence to murder which, if\u000a      successfully pleaded, allows and requires the substitution of a\u000a      manslaughter conviction. Gardner's contribution is restricted to the\u000a      narrowing of this provocation variant.\u000a    Gardner's ideas reached the statute book by the following route. As\u000a      explained in Parliament (Hansard, 3 March 2009, col 422-447; http:\/\/bit.ly\/18KRxa5)\u000a      section 54 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 implements, with some\u000a      drafting changes and some additions, a recommendation of the Law\u000a      Commission made in the report [C1]. The Commission makes the case\u000a      for this recommendation in paras 5.1 to 5.82 of that report. The reliance\u000a      on Gardner's research in preferring the `reasonable emotional response'\u000a      model to the `temporary derangement' model comes at para 5.42 where\u000a      Gardner [R2] is quoted approvingly and at length. This marks a\u000a      definite shift from the more hesitant positions taken in the earlier Law\u000a      Commission report Partial Defences to Murder [C6] but no\u000a      more general adoption of the Gardner model of provocation. The pathway to\u000a      that shift may have involved informal discussions in Oxford instigated by\u000a      the then Chairman of the Law Commission, Mr Justice Toulson, at which\u000a      Gardner attempted to reassure Toulson of the intellectual coherence of\u000a      what he, and the Commission, was already inclined to think. However the\u000a      impact does not depend for its verification on this element of\u000a      dissemination, since it appears on the face of the Law Commission's 2006\u000a      report itself.\u000a    The estimated reach of the 2009 reform is to about half of all\u000a      recorded homicides in England and Wales, namely all those arising out of\u000a      `quarrel, revenge, or loss of temper' as classified in Home Office\u000a      Statistical Bulletin 01\/11 (http:\/\/bit.ly\/pMI6W0,\u000a      page 34), equating to about two-thirds of recorded `acquaintance'\u000a      homicides (ibid). This amounts to something in the order of 300 homicide\u000a      cases a year in which the facts raise a question of whether the accused\u000a      was provoked. The impact extends not only to the cases where a\u000a      provocation (now `loss of self-control') defence is pleaded and argued but\u000a      also to decisions by defence counsel as to whether it should be pleaded,\u000a      decisions by prosecutors as to what plea to accept, and in rare cases\u000a      possibly whether to prosecute at all. Research reported in 2006 (in Law\u000a      Commission, Murder, Manslaughter and Infanticide, Law Com 304,\u000a      2006, appendix C) suggested that the old provocation defence was pleaded\u000a      in about a quarter of homicide trials.\u000a    The significance of the reform, inasmuch as it is based on\u000a      Gardner's work, is that (a) it clarifies and narrows the law about which\u000a      triggers for homicidal action are capable of qualifying as provocations,\u000a      so as to exclude triggers such as crying babies and thunderstorms (which\u000a      nobody could reasonably regard as wrongdoings) and (b) it more generally\u000a      clarifies the doctrinal basis of the provocation defence so as to remove\u000a      an historic judicial vacillation between the `reasonable emotional\u000a      response' model and the `temporary derangement' model (a vacillation which\u000a      came to a head in R v Smith (Morgan) [2001] 1 A.C. 146).\u000a      The reform remains contentious and attracts both critical and approving\u000a      reponses. This testifies to its significance. On 14 January 2009, for\u000a      example, the Daily Mail reported: `Jealousy no defence for killer\u000a      husbands, but abused wives can escape a murder charge' [C9]. A\u000a      more sober `impact assessment' was provided by the Ministry of Justice,\u000a      who pointed out that `the narrower partial defence would lead to some\u000a      defendants who are currently convicted of manslaughter being convicted of\u000a      murder instead. We estimate that there might be an additional 10-20 murder\u000a      convictions a year'\u000a      (http:\/\/bit.ly\/12oIW4x).\u000a    The provisions came into force in October 2010. Technical aspects of the\u000a      relevant provision have received judicial attention in R v Clinton\u000a      [C7] R v Dawes [C8]. The 2009 reforms,\u000a      arising out the use made by the Law Commissioners of Gardner's research in\u000a      the theory of criminal law, remain the law and have improved judicial and\u000a      professional understanding of provocation.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In 2009, the Law Commission adopted a new approach to the defence of\u000a      `provocation' that allowed a manslaughter conviction to be substituted for\u000a      a murder conviction. This new approach was based on a model proposed by\u000a      Professor John Gardner, and is now reflected in English law ensuring more\u000a      stable convictions in certain difficult cases of angry killing.\u000a    Gardner demonstrated that there is space for a third model between the\u000a      two traditional views of `provocation'. Traditionally the `provoked\u000a      defence' was based on a person reasonably retaliating; or a person being\u000a      temporarily deranged. Gardner's research persuasively argues acceptance\u000a      for his new model: of a person whose reasonable anger drives him or her to\u000a      unreasonable retaliation.\u000a    Thanks to Gardner's research, the law now focuses not just on whether the\u000a      accused was murderously angry, but on the causes of this anger. It allows\u000a      a defence (now called `loss of self-control') only if the anger came of\u000a      her `justifiable sense of being seriously wronged'.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Oxford\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[R1] Gardner, J, 'Justifications and Reasons', in Andrew Simester\u000a      and A.T.H.

Virtually all of the\u000a      research and writing was done while Gardner was working for the University\u000a      of Oxford (October 1991-September 1996, then October 2000 onwards).\u000a      Research post-2001 was carried out in collaboration with Professor Timothy\u000a      Macklem of King's College London.\u000a    The breakthrough paper, `The Gist of Excuses' [R2] (to which the\u000a      impact is most directly owed) was based on research from 1994, and was\u000a      prepared and written in the summer of 1996, and submitted for publication\u000a      in August of that year (although it did not appear in print until 1997,\u000a      after Gardner had moved to King's College London). Three of the later\u000a      papers (post-2000) were co-written with Professor Timothy Macklem (King's,\u000a      London) [R3, R4, R6]. Collaborative work with Macklem (50:50)\u000a      began in January 2001, after Gardner had left King's to return to Oxford.\u000a      These papers apply the underlying approach to various more specific legal\u000a      problems. However the Law Commission placed its emphasis, in framing its\u000a      reform, on Gardner's earlier sole-authored work [R1, R2].\u000a    A familiar classification of exculpatory criminal law defences was\u000a      traditionally bipartite: justification or excuse. Excuse, in this broad\u000a      sense, is a residual category covering all exculpatory defences that are\u000a      not justificatory. Gardner has defended a replacement tripartite\u000a      classification, without any residual category [R1, R2]. There are\u000a      justifications (the defendant's offending action was reasonable) and\u000a      denials of responsibility (the defendant should not be held to standards\u000a      of reasonableness). In between are excuses in the strict sense. The\u000a      defendant's offending action was not reasonable, yet it was committed on\u000a      the strength of reasonable beliefs or emotions. Gardner's theoretical\u000a      research has devoted a good deal of attention to establishing not just the\u000a      logical possibility but also the moral, legal and political importance of\u000a      unreasonable action issuing from a reasonable belief or emotion (i.e.\u000a      reasonable mistake and reasonable overreaction).\u000a    The application of this idea to provocation is particularly interesting,\u000a      both legally and philosophically, and that is why Gardner devoted special\u000a      attention to it in this body of research. To understand the idea of a\u000a      reasonable emotion one needs to understand that emotions have objects\u000a      which govern their appropriateness. Anger may be caused by the weather, or\u000a      by a screaming baby; but neither of these is in itself an object of\u000a      appropriate anger. Someone else's wrongdoing (or similar error) is the\u000a      only object of appropriate anger. Inasmuch as provocation is an excuse\u000a      based on reasonable overreaction through anger, it should be available\u000a      only to those who reasonably take themselves to have been wronged.\u000a      Mistakenly assimilating provocation to `diminished responsibility', the\u000a      law had trouble resisting the implication that people can be murderously\u000a      provoked by the weather or by screaming babies. Gardner's work establishes\u000a      why this would be an incorrect inference. Not all of those who are `driven\u000a      crazy' are reasonably angry.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11804","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    1. Directly Influencing Scots law on Extreme Pornography to Include\u000d\u000a          Rape Images\u000d\u000a    Durham University's research has influenced NGO activities, public and\u000d\u000a      policy discussions, the recommendations of the Scottish Justice Committee\u000d\u000a      and Ministry of Justice, and has consequently shaped Scots law on extreme\u000d\u000a      pornography. The effect is that, in contrast to the law in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales, Scottish legislation specifically includes rape within its\u000d\u000a      definition of what constitutes `extreme pornography' (Scottish Criminal\u000d\u000a      Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 s42).\u000d\u000a    Shaping NGO activities and policy debate in Scotland\u000d\u000a      McGlynn and Rackley's research was a large influence on the arguments used\u000d\u000a      by women's organisations in Scotland to campaign for measures against\u000d\u000a      extreme pornography, and specifically on (a) arguments used to justify\u000d\u000a      criminal sanctions and (b) the need to include rape pornography within the\u000d\u000a      remit of the proposed legislation.\u000d\u000a    Rape Crisis Scotland state that McGlynn and Rackley's research was\u000d\u000a      `particularly useful' in directing their campaign away from `the\u000d\u000a      cul-de-sac of causal harm' and was `really, really helpful in terms of how\u000d\u000a      we ... approach[ed] it [the campaign]'. As a result, `we framed it [our\u000d\u000a      campaigning] very much in terms of the cultural harm'. This `had a big\u000d\u000a      impact': ` we got the legislation we wanted in Scotland' because `we\u000d\u000a      managed to avoid what you have in England which is a distinction in terms\u000d\u000a      of forcible rape [with violence] and I think that is quite an\u000d\u000a      achievement'. The effect has been that the new law, `gives us a really\u000d\u000a      important tool to try to address what we think is a major area of concern,\u000d\u000a      but also because the law has an educative function as well' (source 1).\u000d\u000a    The `cultural harm' argument, and examples from a Factsheet on Rape\u000d\u000a      Pornography, produced by McGlynn and Rackley which gave contextual\u000d\u000a      information about the existence and nature of `rape pornography' (see https:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/resources\/glad\/GLADFactsheet.pdf)\u000d\u000a      were also widely cited in the Scottish media (sources 1-2). The\u000a        Scotsman invited McGlynn to submit an opinion piece, arguing for\u000d\u000a      inclusion of pornographic images of rape in legislation on the basis of\u000d\u000a      `cultural harm' (`Is this Big Brother in the Bedroom: No', 18 January\u000d\u000a      2009, http:\/\/www.scotsman.com\/news\/jail-for-downloading-extreme-sex-images-1-754571),\u000a      and the newspaper gave support and emphasis with a front-page article.\u000d\u000a    This discussion of `cultural harm', and the omission of rape from the new\u000d\u000a      English law ensured that, in contrast to debates in England and Wales\u000d\u000a      prior to the enactment of the CJIA, public debate focused on violence\u000d\u000a      against women. This created the policy context in which the Scottish law\u000d\u000a      on extreme pornography was more likely to include pornographic rape\u000d\u000a      images.\u000d\u000a    Shaping the Recommendations of Scottish Parliament Justice Committee\u000d\u000a        and Ministry of Justice\u000d\u000a      In December 2008, in order to influence the Scottish consultation and\u000d\u000a      legislative processes, McGlynn and Rackley disseminated the research\u000d\u000a      findings of outputs 1-3 through letters to a large number of\u000d\u000a      Scottish MSPs, government ministers and departments (see, eg, https:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/resources\/glad\/GLADLetter.pdf).\u000a      These letters presented the key lessons from analysis of the English\u000d\u000a      legislation (drawing on outputs 1-3), emphasising the failure of\u000d\u000a      the English legislation to criminalise the possession of all rape\u000d\u000a      pornography, as well as outlining the `cultural harm' justification for\u000d\u000a      the introduction of a law criminalising the possession of extreme\u000d\u000a      pornography. In January 2009, McGlynn drew on outputs 1-3 to\u000d\u000a      deliver a plenary lecture at a conference organised by Rape Crisis\u000d\u000a      Scotland, and attended by the Scottish press, the Scottish Justice\u000d\u000a      Minister, members of the Scottish Procurator Fiscal's Office and women's\u000d\u000a      rights campaigners and activists.\u000d\u000a    McGlynn and Rackley also submitted written evidence (with copies of outputs\u000a        1-2) to the Scottish Parliament's Justice Committee during its\u000d\u000a      consultation on the proposed legislation. In addition, eight women's\u000d\u000a      organisations, comprising one third of respondents and including Rape\u000d\u000a      Crisis Scotland and the Women's Support Project (a Glasgow-based women's\u000d\u000a      organisation funded by local and national government), deployed the\u000d\u000a      `cultural harm' argument in their submissions to the Justice Committee\u000d\u000a      and\/or quoted directly from the Factsheet on Rape Pornography, produced by\u000d\u000a      McGlynn and Rackley (source 3). During their deliberations, after\u000d\u000a      the initial consultation process, the Committee received supplementary\u000d\u000a      evidence from a third party which highlighted and responded to McGlynn and\u000d\u000a      Rackley's submission (source 4, p. 13). McGlynn and Rackley's\u000d\u000a      submission had a direct influence on the Committee's recommendations. In\u000d\u000a      its Report, the Committee endorsed their argument that the use of the term\u000d\u000a      `obscenity' should be reviewed, and that greater consideration should be\u000d\u000a      given to the 'cultural harm' of extreme pornography (source 5,\u000d\u000a        [292-4], [315]).\u000d\u000a    In 2010, the Scottish Parliament adopted a new criminal law on extreme\u000d\u000a      pornography which was broader than the English legislation and which\u000d\u000a      specifically covered rape pornography. In 2011, the Scottish Justice\u000d\u000a      Directorate responded to a Freedom of Information request from the\u000d\u000a      organisation `Consenting Adult Action Network' which had objected to the\u000d\u000a      legislation, and which sought information on how the decision had been\u000d\u000a      made to include rape. In response, the Justice Directorate referred\u000d\u000a      directly to the letter received by the Minister of Justice from McGlynn\u000d\u000a      and Rackley as advocating for this and attached a copy of the letter to\u000d\u000a      its response (source 6).\u000d\u000a    2. Changing Government Policy in England &amp; Wales and\u000d\u000a          Influencing NGO Campaigns\u000d\u000a    In May 2013, the Ministry of Justice stated that it did not `feel it\u000d\u000a      appropriate or necessary' to extend the law to cover pornographic images\u000d\u000a      of rape (source 7). Following this announcement, Rape Crisis\u000d\u000a      (South London) and the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW)\u000d\u000a      launched their successful `Stop Rape Porn' campaign (source 1).\u000d\u000a      McGlynn and Rackley advised this campaign, and shaped the arguments it\u000d\u000a      presented. EVAW state that Durham University's research is `incredibly\u000d\u000a      powerful and is really important ... [it] helps us to make the case to\u000d\u000a      government, and it improves the way that we influence and the work that we\u000d\u000a      do as it brings something very solid to our campaigns' (source 1).\u000d\u000a    McGlynn's and Rackley's work included: attending meetings at the Ministry\u000d\u000a      of Justice and with Government and Opposition MPs; producing briefing\u000d\u000a      documents, drawing on outputs 1 and 2, making comparisons between\u000d\u000a      English and Scottish law, and making recommendations for reform https:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/resourcesglad\/McGlynnRackleyRapeP_rnBriefingJuly2013.pdf).\u000a      They also assisted EVAW in drafting an open letter to the Prime Minister,\u000d\u000a      which was signed by over 100 women's groups, campaigners and academics,\u000d\u000a      including Sue Berelowitz, Deputy Children's Commissioner and Mumsnet (source\u000a        7). The campaign attracted considerable public support. A Change.org\u000d\u000a      petition, which referred to the Durham University research, secured over\u000d\u000a      72,000 signatories in a month, and the issue was raised by three MPs\u000d\u000a      during an Opposition Day debate in Parliament. During the debate, Diana\u000d\u000a      Johnson MP quoted McGlynn's statement, drawing on the arguments of output\u000a        2, stating that \"It is undeniable that the proliferation and\u000d\u000a      tolerance of such images and the messages they convey contributes to a\u000d\u000a      cultural climate where sexual violence is condoned\" (source 8).\u000d\u000a      The campaign also shaped wider public debate. During June and July 2013,\u000d\u000a      McGlynn and Rackley were quoted or referred to over 45 times in\u000d\u000a      international media (France, New Zealand, India) and in national media\u000d\u000a      (including Guardian, Daily Mail, Independent, Times, Observer,\u000d\u000a      BBC news and Sky News). There were over 210 further media discussions of\u000d\u000a      the campaign, including the front page of the Daily Telegraph\u000d\u000a      (`Porn loophole \"gives animals more rights than women\"', 18.6.13) (source\u000a        9). McGlynn was also interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour and\u000d\u000a      `Law in Action' about rape pornography and the key findings of the\u000d\u000a      research (http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/p018rdr5\u000d\u000a      (8.5.13); http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b0213yg9\u000d\u000a      (6.6.13)).\u000d\u000a    The effect of the campaigns influenced by McGlynn and Rackley is that in\u000d\u000a      July 2013, the Prime Minister announced that the Government would `clos[e]\u000d\u000a      the loophole' in the legislation, `making it a criminal offence to possess\u000d\u000a      internet pornography that depicts rape' (source 10). In announcing\u000d\u000a      this change of policy, the Prime Minister recognised that possession of\u000d\u000a      such material was already a criminal offence in Scotland, and that such\u000d\u000a      `images normalise sexual violence against women' repeating the arguments\u000d\u000a      made during the campaign and in Durham University's research. EVAW state\u000d\u000a      that Durham's `research on extreme pornography was absolutely fundamental\u000d\u000a      to securing the high profile commitment by the Prime Minister' and that\u000d\u000a      `without the research and the expertise of the legal academics ...there is\u000d\u000a      no clear way that that would have been such a success, and it was a\u000d\u000a      success in a very very short period of time because it was so evidenced\u000d\u000a      and so strong' (source 10).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted by the research group `Gender and Law at Durham'\u000d\u000a      (GLAD) has had a significant effect on the enactment and reform of the\u000d\u000a      criminal law relating to the possession of extreme pornography, and on the\u000d\u000a      activities of NGOs lobbying for change in this area. In particular, the\u000d\u000a      research has generated the following impacts:\u000d\u000a    (1) In Scotland, it has shaped the campaigns of NGOs,\u000d\u000a      recommendations of the Parliamentary Justice Committee, and new\u000d\u000a      legislation by the Scottish Parliament to criminalise the possession of\u000d\u000a      pornographic images of rape.\u000d\u000a    (2) In England, it was used by Rape Crisis (South London) and the\u000d\u000a      End Violence Against Women Coalition for their campaign to `close the rape\u000d\u000a      porn \"loophole\"'. This led to a change in Government policy in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales, and a public commitment by the Prime Minister to amend existing\u000d\u000a      English legislation criminalising the possession of extreme pornography to\u000d\u000a      include rape pornography.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Durham University\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Durham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Durham","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"North East","UKPRN":10007143}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

Though initially\u000d\u000a      the definition of `extreme pornography' was sufficiently broad to\u000d\u000a      encompass pornographic images of rape, in response to criticisms during\u000d\u000a      the consultation process, the UK government subsequently narrowed the\u000d\u000a      definition of extreme pornography to exclude the majority of such images.\u000d\u000a      This narrow definition was enacted in the Criminal Justice and Immigration\u000d\u000a      Act 2008 (CJIA) for England and Wales accompanied by a further\u000d\u000a      specification that material must be `obscene' in order to constitute\u000d\u000a      `extreme pornography'. The Scottish Executive did not publish its response\u000d\u000a      to the consultation until 2008, after the enactment of the CJIA.\u000d\u000a    An analysis of the initial proposals by McGlynn and Rackley in 2007 (output\u000a        1) criticised the UK government's decision to narrow the definition\u000d\u000a      of `extreme pornography' on the basis that it would not cover pornographic\u000d\u000a      images of rape unless they were accompanied by serious or life-\u000d\u000a      threatening violence. Following the introduction of the CJIA McGlynn and\u000d\u000a      Rackley published a detailed criticism of the legislation (output 2),\u000d\u000a      which included recommendations that the law be reformed to (1) remove the\u000d\u000a      criterion of `obscenity', as this focuses on moral harm and offence, and\u000d\u000a      (2) extend the definition of extreme pornography to encompass images of\u000d\u000a      rape. They proposed a justification for the criminalisation of\u000d\u000a      pornographic images of rape on the basis of the `cultural harm' of forms\u000d\u000a      of extreme pornography which sexualise violence against women.\u000d\u000a      Justifications for criminal law have tended to focus on a requirement for\u000d\u000a      evidence of direct, physical harm to specific individuals before\u000d\u000a      legislation is adopted. In contrast, McGlynn and Rackley's research argued\u000d\u000a      that the prevalence and easy availability of rape pornography generates a\u000d\u000a      form of `cultural harm' against many women, sufficient to justify\u000d\u000a      criminalisation. It is a paradigmatic example of sexualised violence\u000d\u000a      against women, which contributes to the normalisation and prevalence of\u000d\u000a      such violence and its marginalisation in the criminal justice system. In\u000d\u000a      an article co-authored with Ward, McGlynn developed the argument that the\u000d\u000a      law should not be based on obscenity standards, but instead justified on\u000d\u000a      the basis of `cultural harm' (output 3).\u000d\u000a    The value of the `cultural harm' argument is that it provides an\u000d\u000a      additional justification for criminal regulation in the absence of direct\u000d\u000a      evidence of a causal link between extreme pornography and sexual violence.\u000d\u000a      This is a particularly useful argument in policy debates that are\u000d\u000a      generally polarised between conservative morality-based justifications\u000d\u000a      (which do not focus on violence against women but the immorality of\u000d\u000a      pornography) and liberal free speech concerns (about the absence of a\u000d\u000a      direct causal link between pornography and physical harm). In addition,\u000d\u000a      the focus on rape pornography directs debate towards the potential adverse\u000d\u000a      impacts of pornography on women, rather than on the traditional focus on\u000d\u000a      morality and freedom of expression.\u000d\u000a    The research was carried out from 2007 to 2009 when McGlynn was a\u000d\u000a      Professor in Durham and Rackley a lecturer, then senior lecturer. Ian Ward\u000d\u000a      is Professor of Law at Newcastle University, and was responsible for one\u000d\u000a      half of output 3. He did not contribute to the dissemination activities.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11805","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The considerable reach of these impacts may be seen by the fact that they\u000a      have extended to two major government bodies (the MoJ and CPS), two\u000a      Parliamentary Joint Committees, and an NGO. Their significance lies in the\u000a      substantial changes they have brought about to legislation, parliamentary\u000a      assessment of the human rights implications of that legislation, the\u000a      judgment of an international human rights court, and national policy on\u000a      prosecuting journalists.\u000a    1. Influencing the Defamation Act 2013\u000a    Phillipson was invited to be the sole academic member of the Ministry of\u000a      Justice Libel Working Group (Jan-March 2010), which considered options for\u000a      reform of defamation law. Proposals from the Report were then embodied in\u000a      the Government's Defamation Bill, published in draft in 2011 and\u000a      introduced into Parliament in 2012. Drawing on output 1,\u000a      Phillipson drafted a report for the Group (\"Public Interest Defence\"\u000a      (1 Mar 2010)), summarising his research findings on relevant case-law of\u000a      the ECtHR. His arguments were incorporated into the Working Group's Report\u000a      and assisted in convincing the MoJ that proposals for more radical\u000a      pro-media reforms advocated by the Libel Reform Campaign (LRC)\u000a      over-privileged free speech and therefore risked breaching the UK's\u000a      obligations under Article 8 ECHR. Paragraph 79 of the Report adopted\u000a      Phillipson's argument (in particular paragraphs 83-85 were drafted and\u000a      corrected by Phillipson (source 1)) and advocated using\u000a      legislation not to introduce the radical new defence advocated by the LRC,\u000a      but instead to consolidate and clarify the existing Reynolds\u000a      defence. The Defamation Bill (cl 4) followed this recommendation (source\u000a        2a at [29]). An amendment to clause 4 in the name of Lord Lester was\u000a      subsequently made to the Bill &#8212; see now section 4 of the Defamation Act\u000a      2013 &#8212; but this simply amounted to a different way of capturing the\u000a      existing defence, as the Explanatory Notes to the Act make clear (source\u000a        2b at [29]).\u000a    2. Contribution to Parliamentary assessment of human rights\u000a        implications of Defamation Bill\u000a    Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) considers the\u000a      compatibility of all proposed legislation with the UK's human rights\u000a      obligations. Drawing on output 5, Phillipson submitted evidence to\u000a      the Committee on the Defamation Bill 2012 which, inter alia:\u000a      (a) argued against a radical change to the Bill proposed by the Libel\u000a      Reform Campaign [17-28];\u000a    (b) suggested that the Bill should be amended to require a higher burden\u000a      of harm to be shown by corporate claimants [46-47] (http:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/documents\/joint-committees\/human-\u000a        rights\/Prof_Gavin_Phillipson.pdf).\u000a    In its Report (source 3), the JCHR responded to each point:\u000a      On point (a) the Committee gave extensive consideration to Phillipson's\u000a      arguments [29-34] and adopted them, stating: \"We share the view of\u000a      Professor Phillipson on this matter...\" [34].\u000a      On point (b) the Committee set out Phillipson's argument with approval at\u000a      [55] and its recommendation concurred with his [58].\u000a    Parliamentarians and the Government followed the recommendation in point\u000a      (a) by continuing to resist the proposed Libel Reform Campaign amendment.\u000a      The House of Lords amended clause 1 of the Bill in line with the JCHR's\u000a      recommendation on point (b) &#8212; see now s1(2) of the Act.\u000a    Moreover, the significance of JCHR reports extends well beyond specific\u000a      changes made to the legislation to which they relate in Parliament. Their\u000a      reports are an authoritative finding by Parliament on the compliance of\u000a      legislation with the UK's human rights obligations and are used by lawyers\u000a      preparing court challenges, and influence other parliamentary bodies,\u000a      NGOs, and the findings of international human rights bodies, including the\u000a      UN and ECtHR.\u000a    3. Contribution to Parliamentary Inquiry on Privacy\u000a    Phillipson gave oral and written evidence to the Joint Committee on\u000a      Privacy and Injunctions in October 2011, which was established following\u000a      controversies around the granting of `super injunctions' to celebrities\u000a      and public figures, to consider whether changes in the law and media\u000a      regulation were needed (p 848-857: http:\/\/www.parliament.uk\/documents\/joint-\u000a        committees\/Privacy_and_Injunctions\/JCPIWrittenEvWeb.pdf). Phillipson\u000a      was one of only four legal academics invited to give oral evidence to the\u000a      Committee. His evidence (drawing on outputs 1-4) argued that\u000a      section 12 of the Human Rights Act (HRA) struck an appropriate balance\u000a      between Articles 8 and 10 of the ECHR and therefore should not be\u000a      radically reformed, as many in the media were arguing. The Committee's\u000a      Report cited Phillipson's evidence (source 4, at [55]; note 63)\u000a      and endorsed his argument against the radical reform of section 12, saying\u000a      \"We do not recommend any alteration to the law in this area\" [59].\u000a      This recommendation has been followed by Parliament and the Government in\u000a      that neither has announced any plans to reform section 12 of the HRA.\u000a    4. Influence on Crown Prosecution Service official guidance\u000a    The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), in the light of the phone\u000a      hacking scandal, published draft guidelines to assist prosecutors\u000a      considering the \"public interest\" element of the decision whether to\u000a      prosecute journalists who commit offences such as phone and email hacking.\u000a      Phillipson was invited to discuss the guidelines in a small seminar with\u000a      interested parties (mostly national media bodies; Phillipson was one of\u000a      only three legal academics invited) and respond to the formal consultation\u000a      process (source 7).\u000a    Drawing on outputs 1-4, Phillipson, in his written and oral\u000a      evidence to the DPP (https:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/resources\/hrc\/projects\/ConsultationontheInterimGuidelinesforProsecutorson\u000a        AssessingthePublicMediaInterestinCasesAffectingtheMedia.pdf),\u000a      recommended narrowing how the interim Guidelines defined the \"public\u000a      interest\" journalists might be considered to have served by\u000a      obtaining information through unlawful means. Para 31(d) of the interim\u000a      Guidelines stated that this included conduct \"capable of raising or\u000a      contributing to an important matter of public debate\" (source 5).\u000a      Phillipson argued that, in order to avoid privileging speech over privacy,\u000a      a more restrictive interpretation of \"public debate\" was needed,\u000a      indicating what types of debate were sufficiently important here. He\u000a      suggested instancing \"seriously unethical conduct\", \"misuse of public\u000a      money\" and seriously misleading the public. The Final Guidelines partially\u000a      adopted this point by re-defining \"public debate\" as including \"serious\u000a      impropriety, significant unethical conduct and significant incompetence,\u000a      which affects the public\" (source 6, [31(d)]).\u000a    5. Influence on submission to and judgment of European Court of Human\u000a        Rights\u000a    Output 1 impacted on the third party intervention submitted by the\u000a      Media Lawyers Association (MLA) to the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR in\u000a      relation to the cases of Von Hannover v Germany (No 2),\u000a      Application 40660\/08 and 60641\/08 (7 Feb 2012) and Springer v Germany,\u000a      Application 39954\/08 (7 Feb 2012). The submission adopted and cited the\u000a      argument, developed in outputs 1 &amp; 5, that the scope of\u000a      Article 8 had been over-extended by the ECtHR in the previous decision Von\u000a        Hannover v Germany (2004) by finding that the press would generally\u000a      be invading privacy if they published photographs of an individual, even\u000a      in public, without their consent. The argument was that this gave too much\u000a      priority to privacy over free speech (source 8, [16-17] &amp;\u000a        fn 14 and 17 citing p 677-683 of output 1).\u000a    The Court's judgment cited the MLA intervention at (source 10, [92])\u000a      and responded by shifting the balance between the two rights towards\u000a      freedom of speech, such that the case has been described academically as\u000a      an \"important win for the press\" (source 9, at p. 108). The Court\u000a      indicated that, where pictures complained of were anodyne and taken in\u000a      public places without aggravating factors, prohibition of their\u000a      publication could not be justified given even a weak public interest in\u000a      the text accompanying them (source 10, [122-123]). This partially\u000a      accepted the MLA's argument that Article 8 privacy rights had been taken\u000a      too far. The judgments of the Court bind the state party to the case and\u000a      govern the interpretation of the Convention, acceded to by the 47 states\u000a      of the Council of Europe &#8212; covering some 800 million people.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research conducted by Durham University on the reconciliation of free\u000a      speech with rights of privacy and reputation has significantly affected\u000a      contemporary law and policy around the law of privacy, media injunctions\u000a      and libel reform.

The research addressed the\u000a      problem of how English law can accommodate the developing case-law of the\u000a      ECtHR setting out the correct interpretation of Article 8 of the European\u000a      Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) &#8212; which protects privacy and reputation\u000a      &#8212; and its interplay with Article 10 of the ECHR, which protects freedom of\u000a      expression. This jurisprudence has fed into English law in two major\u000a      areas: first, the development since 2000 of a common law action for\u000a      invasion of privacy by publication of private information, often resulting\u000a      in injunctions preventing publication of articles in the media (analysed\u000a      in outputs 1- 4); second, judicial and legislative reform to the\u000a      law of libel, and in particular the Defamation Act 2013 (outputs 1 and\u000a        5).\u000a    In particular, the research: (a) analysed the proper scope and weight of\u000a      Article 8 of the ECHR in relation to publication by the media of\u000a      non-consensually taken photographs of individuals in what was the first\u000a      and most influential full length analysis of this issue (outputs 1, 3,\u000a        &amp; 4) and (b) set out an original methodology for courts engaged\u000a      in complex proportionality-based balancing of Articles 8 and 10 of the\u000a      ECHR in privacy cases; this was based in turn on a theoretical analysis of\u000a      the philosophical values underlying these two rights (outputs 1, 2, 3\u000a        &amp; 5). Phillipson's research, rejecting the presumptive priority\u000a      of freedom of expression (as seen, for example in US law), has affected\u000a      English law's treatment of this issue and continues to influence both the\u000a      public policy debate and specific proposals for reform in this area in\u000a      libel and privacy.\u000a    It also fed into a further issue: the implications for reform of domestic\u000a      libel law of the recent recognition by the ECtHR of reputation as an\u000a      aspect of Article 8 of the ECHR. Phillipson's research in this area\u000a      consisted of outputs 1 and 5, the former constituting the first\u000a      full length academic treatment of the Article 8\/libel issue, the second\u000a      the first full analysis of the then Defamation Bill 2012. Phillipson\u000a      concluded that the current stance of the common law of defamation\u000a      represented by what is known as Reynolds privilege &#8212; protecting\u000a      responsibly-published, public interest journalism &#8212; was broadly in\u000a      accordance with ECHR principles and that the more radical reform proposals\u000a      of the highly influential Libel Reform Campaign (http:\/\/libelreform.org\/)\u000a      were based on unsound comparative law analysis, failed to engage with the\u000a      philosophical foundations for free speech and would, if implemented, place\u000a      the UK in breach of its obligations under Article 8 of the ECHR.\u000a    Phillipson was a lecturer, then senior lecturer at Durham between 2000\u000a      and 2005, and has been a Professor of Law at Durham University since 2007.\u000a      Fenwick has been at the Law School since 1987 and a Professor since 2001.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11806","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"783754","Name":"Albania"},{"GeoNamesId":"831053","Name":"Kosovo"},{"GeoNamesId":"3277605","Name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"GeoNamesId":"587116","Name":"Azerbaijan"},{"GeoNamesId":"174982","Name":"Armenia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Armed forces, security and intelligence services are traditionally closed\u000d\u000a      domains resistant to\u000d\u000a      external influence.

According to the\u000d\u000a      report's co-author, a Project Coordinator for DCAF, the UN Report is `the\u000d\u000a      first set of international\u000d\u000a      principles on the regulation and oversight of intelligence services' (source\u000d\u000a        1). It was released in\u000d\u000a      2010 and has since been `translated into all UN official languages ...\u000d\u000a      presented throughout the\u000d\u000a      world and cited by a number of leading national intelligence oversight\u000d\u000a      bodies' (source 1).\u000d\u000a    He continues `more than half of the good practices presented to the UN\u000d\u000a      Human Rights Council\u000d\u000a      were directly influenced' by outputs 4 and 6 (source 1).\u000d\u000a      Of the 35 `good practices' identified 29\u000d\u000a      are either wholly or substantially the same as (19), or partially based on\u000d\u000a      (10), those elaborated in\u000d\u000a      output 4. The report follows output 4 by (a) closely\u000d\u000a      following its substantive content in the\u000d\u000a      practices endorsed and (b) adopting a best practice approach to\u000d\u000a      intelligence oversight standards\u000d\u000a      based on a survey of legislation. The report's co-author describes the\u000d\u000a      analysis in output 4 as\u000d\u000a      having been `invaluable in shaping' the sections dealing with human rights\u000d\u000a      protection (source 2\u000d\u000a        [27-33]), information collection (source 2 [34-46]) and the\u000d\u000a      use of personal data (source 2 [37-40])\u000d\u000a      and that `the framework for intelligence governance pioneered in [output\u000d\u000a        1] ... underpins the\u000d\u000a      approach taken in the UN compilation' (source 1). The endorsed\u000d\u000a      good practices include ensuring\u000d\u000a      a clear mandate and legal basis for security and intelligence agencies,\u000d\u000a      oversight institutions,\u000d\u000a      complaints processes and effective remedies, principles of responsibility\u000d\u000a      and accountability for\u000d\u000a      state institutions and individual officials. As recommended in output\u000d\u000a        1, the practices also endorse\u000d\u000a      working principles of impartiality, non-discrimination and professionalism\u000d\u000a      in, among other things,\u000d\u000a      intelligence collection and the use of powers of arrest and detention, and\u000d\u000a      intelligence-sharing and\u000d\u000a      cooperation (source 2, good practices 1-13, 15-26, 31-33 &amp; 35).\u000d\u000a    2. Influencing the UK Intelligence and Security Committee and\u000d\u000a          Justice and Security Act\u000d\u000a          2013: In November 2010, Leigh presented options for reform of\u000d\u000a      intelligence oversight at a high-level\u000d\u000a      policy conference supported by the Cabinet Office at the Royal United\u000d\u000a      Services Institute,\u000d\u000a      timed to coincide with the Government's Strategic Defence and Security\u000d\u000a      Review and the then-planned\u000d\u000a      Counter-Terrorism Legislation Review (launched in October 2011). Following\u000d\u000a      this, Leigh\u000d\u000a      was one of two academics invited to brief the Chair of the ISC in writing\u000d\u000a      on reform options (source\u000d\u000a        3). Drawing on outputs 2, 4-6, Leigh (with Gill, Honorary\u000d\u000a      Fellow, University of Liverpool)\u000d\u000a      advocated enhanced democratic oversight of the intelligence and security\u000d\u000a      services by reforming\u000d\u000a      the remit, status and powers of the ISC and introducing an independent\u000d\u000a      fact-finding process\u000d\u000a      (source 3). These recommendations were subsequently discussed at a\u000d\u000a      meeting of the ISC and\u000d\u000a      shaped its own submission to the Government's review (source 3).\u000d\u000a      In that submission the ISC\u000d\u000a      proposed that it should become a Committee of Parliament, have an extended\u000d\u000a      remit to cover the\u000d\u000a      entire intelligence community in the UK, have the power to compel the\u000d\u000a      provision of information\u000d\u000a      (subject to a ministerial veto), and have greater investigative and\u000d\u000a      research resources (source 4,\u000d\u000a        section 7).\u000d\u000a    A number of these proposals were considered in the Justice and\u000d\u000a        Security Green Paper (source\u000d\u000a        5, [3.16]) and were subsequently enacted in the Justice and Security\u000d\u000a      Act 2013. The legislation\u000d\u000a      reflects Leigh's briefing to the ISC and the underlying research (outputs\u000d\u000a        2, 4-6) by extending\u000d\u000a      oversight to the whole intelligence community and by enhancing\u000d\u000a      parliamentary ownership of\u000d\u000a      oversight through parliamentary appointment of ISC members, provision to\u000d\u000a      those members of\u000d\u000a      security of tenure and control over Chair selection. The Act also gives\u000d\u000a      the ISC powers to obtain\u000d\u000a      `operational' information and greater autonomy over the content and timing\u000d\u000a      of reports to Parliament\u000d\u000a      (see respectively, output 4, chs. 16, 18 &amp; 19 and\u000d\u000a      Justice and Security Act 2013, sections 1(3),\u000d\u000a      1(6), 2(3), 3(1) and 3(6) and sched. 1, para 1).\u000d\u000a    3. Influencing standards for rights protection of Armed Forces\u000d\u000a          personnel in the Council of\u000d\u000a          Europe (COE): In 2010 the Council of Ministers of the COE\u000d\u000a      formally adopted a series of principles\u000d\u000a      for protecting the human rights of armed forced personnel based\u000d\u000a      substantially on output 3 (source\u000d\u000a        6). Durham University's research is the sole non-treaty source\u000d\u000a      referred to in this resolution. Of the\u000d\u000a      85 principles in the resolution, 37 correspond directly to best practices\u000d\u000a      advocated in output 3. (See\u000d\u000a      those concerning torture and inhuman and degrading punishment (COE 10-12;\u000d\u000a      output 3 chs. 16 &amp;\u000d\u000a        20), military discipline (COE 21, and 33; output 3, ch. 21),\u000d\u000a      trial of criminal charges (COE 29-31;\u000d\u000a      output 3, ch. 21), respect for private and family life (COE 36, 38-9; output\u000d\u000a        3 chs. 14 &amp; 17),\u000d\u000a      freedom of religion and conscientious objection (COE 40-41 and 44-46; output\u000d\u000a        3, chs.11 &amp; 10),\u000d\u000a      freedom of expression (COE 47-48; output 3, ch. 8), the right to\u000d\u000a      access to relevant information\u000d\u000a      (COE 49; output 3 ch. 15), the right of peaceful assembly and\u000d\u000a      association (COE 53-57; output 3,\u000d\u000a        chs. 8 &amp; 9), the right to vote and stand for election (COE 58\u000d\u000a      and 59; output 3, ch. 8), the right to\u000d\u000a      fair remuneration and a retirement pension (COE 63-65; output 3, chs.\u000d\u000a        13, 17 &amp; 18), dignity at\u000d\u000a      work and non-discrimination (COE 66, 70-74,75 and 77; output 3, chs.\u000d\u000a        11-14 &amp; 17), the treatment\u000d\u000a      of young recruits (COE 79-80 and 82-84; output 3 ch. 15), human\u000d\u000a      rights training (COE 83-85;\u000d\u000a      output 3 ch. 19), and the right o complain to an independent body\u000d\u000a      (COE 85; output 3 chs. 16 &amp;\u000d\u000a        22). The resolution recommends that member states give effect to\u000d\u000a      these principles in national\u000d\u000a      legislation and through military training, practice and dissemination.\u000d\u000a      Although not formally binding,\u000d\u000a      this resolution provides an international impetus for legislative and\u000d\u000a      practical reform at domestic\u000d\u000a      level across the 47 member states of the COE, with the principles\u000d\u000a      providing rights-based\u000d\u000a      benchmarks for that process.\u000d\u000a    4. Promoting Rights Protection for Armed Forces Personnel in OSCE\u000d\u000a          Countries: The findings\u000d\u000a      of output 3 have been extensively used by the OSCE to raise\u000d\u000a      awareness in participating states of\u000d\u000a      the rights of armed forces personnel and to advocate policy change at the\u000d\u000a      national level.

In response, it\u000d\u000a      advocates a `Citizens in\u000d\u000a      Uniform' approach, proposing that any restrictions on the rights of\u000d\u000a      service personnel should be\u000d\u000a      strictly related to concrete military objectives and be no more than are\u000d\u000a      necessary to fulfil them.

The second consultation was published in April 2009 and included\u000d\u000a      Easton's suggestion in her response to the first consultation, on using a\u000d\u000a      prisoner's last address to avoid block voting concerns, in Question 5\u000d\u000a      where \"The government proposes that prisoners should be entitled to\u000d\u000a      register and vote on the basis of their previous or intended address ...\"\u000d\u000a      . The second consultation paper also appeared to have taken account of\u000d\u000a      Easton's suggestion that the decision to grant or withdraw voting rights\u000d\u000a      for convicted prisoners should not be left to those passing sentences, as\u000d\u000a      it would constitute an additional burden for them, as this issue became\u000d\u000a      only one of the options to be considered, rather than the greater role\u000d\u000a      contemplated in the first consultation.\u000d\u000a    In September 2009, Liberty published its response to the second\u000d\u000a      consultation and cited Easton's work to support their argument that \"for\u000d\u000a      principled and practical reasons a sentence of any term of imprisonment\u000d\u000a      should not lead to the loss of the right to vote\".

Denial of the right to vote\u000d\u000a        undermines respect for the law, and the principles of equality and\u000d\u000a        inclusion. Conversely, allowing prisoners to vote affirms the legitimacy\u000d\u000a        of the values of democratic society. The right is not a privilege but a\u000d\u000a        fundamental civil right... Voting would give prisoners a much-needed\u000d\u000a        voice in the democratic process.'\u000d\u000a    Also in 2009, UNLOCK circulated Easton's 2006 Modern Law Review paper to\u000d\u000a      its members as part of its Voting for Prisoners Campaign.\u000d\u000a    Easton discussed the issue in an article in The Guardian in February 9\u000d\u000a      2011; this article was reproduced on other news sites, including Ekklesia,\u000d\u000a      and was cited by the Criminal Justice Alliance http:\/\/criminaljusticealliance.org\/11-02-18.htm#11\u000d\u000a      The article itself generated over two hundred comments from the public.\u000d\u000a    Easton has also been interviewed by Channel 4 News http:\/\/www.channel4.com\/news\/echr-judges-rule-on-thorny-issue-of-criminal-voting-rights\u000d\u000a      and http:\/\/www.channel4.com\/news\/uk-must-allow-prisoners-to-vote-european-court-rules\u000d\u000a      and has participated in a debate on LBC radio on this issue.\u000d\u000a    On 11 April 2011, the ECtHR gave the UK government six months to\u000d\u000a      introduce legislative proposals. However, an extension was granted in\u000d\u000a      August 2011 which allowed the government six months from the publication\u000d\u000a      of the judgement in the Scoppola v Italy (No 3) case. The hearing\u000d\u000a      took place on 2 November 2011. In response to the Scoppola\u000d\u000a      decision a draft bill has been produced which is under review and its\u000d\u000a      options include restoring the vote to selected groups of prisoners. The\u000d\u000a      Committee has been taking evidence from interested parties and will be\u000d\u000a      reporting to Parliament in the autumn of 2013.\u000d\u000a    Easton's work, specifically the Probation Journal article, is\u000d\u000a      also cited in the briefing paper Standard Note SN\/PC\/01764, dated 7\u000d\u000a      September 2011 given to MPs in support of their parliamentary duties. It\u000d\u000a      was also given to members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee to read\u000d\u000a      prior to the Round Table held at Westminster in June 2013 on the issues\u000d\u000a      raised by the Bill which Dr Easton was invited to attend. She was\u000d\u000a      questioned by the Committee on the arguments and evidence offered in her\u000d\u000a      paper and asked to consider the implications of the options in the draft\u000d\u000a      Bill.

Given the\u000d\u000a      record numbers of prisoners in the UK, the high incarceration rate\u000d\u000a      relative to other European societies, and the profile of the prison\u000d\u000a      population which is marked by social exclusion, Easton's research examines\u000d\u000a      ways of combating social exclusion, as recognising prisoners' civil and\u000d\u000a      social rights may promote the social inclusion of prisoners. In this\u000d\u000a      context Easton's research has focused specifically on the question of\u000d\u000a      prisoners' right to vote, examining in detail the justifications for\u000d\u000a      disenfranchisement, and the case for re-enfranchisement.\u000d\u000a    Easton's research examines the practicalities and feasibility of change\u000d\u000a      and the form it might take and examines the experience of other\u000d\u000a      jurisdictions, to see if prisoners could vote from within prison without\u000d\u000a      undermining the purity of the ballot box. The research has challenged the\u000d\u000a      key justifications of denial of the vote, including the arguments that\u000d\u000a      prisoners do not deserve voting rights, that it is a legitimate element of\u000d\u000a      punishment and that disenfranchisement encourages civic responsibility. In\u000d\u000a      favour of enfranchisement Easton has argued that treating prisoners as\u000d\u000a      citizens by giving them the vote may encourage them to reflect on their\u000d\u000a      civic obligations and this may ultimately have an influence on\u000d\u000a      re-offending. It would also add to the legitimacy of the prison system and\u000d\u000a      mean that the UK is fulfilling its obligations under international law\u000d\u000a    A change in the law to allow prisoners to vote would be significant\u000d\u000a      because it would reverse a process of exclusion that is deeply rooted in\u000d\u000a      English law, of treating the prisoner as socially dead. It would recognise\u000d\u000a      that, despite their wrongdoing, prisoners still remain members of society\u000d\u000a      and in challenging social exclusion, it would promote the re-integration\u000d\u000a      and rehabilitation of prisoners into society, which would have\u000d\u000a      implications for re-offending. It would also give prisoners an opportunity\u000d\u000a      to contribute to the democratic process as voters rather than mere\u000d\u000a      constituents, which could assist their efforts to improve prison\u000d\u000a      conditions. A change in the law would also affect large numbers of\u000d\u000a      prisoners, as the numbers of prisoners currently disenfranchised are\u000d\u000a      substantial. Easton has sought to influence the debate on this question,\u000d\u000a      through research which has been published in peer reviewed journals and a\u000d\u000a      research monograph published in the last few years. Easton responded to\u000d\u000a      the two Consultation Papers on this issue and noted that in the second\u000d\u000a      paper the government's position had shifted more towards change.

Subsequently, four\u000a      of these eight statements were used to assess respondents' attitudes to\u000a      speed cameras in all three National Speed Camera Partnership (NSCP)\u000a      evaluations commissioned by the Department for Transport, (DfT, 2003: 5-2,\u000a      5-3; Gains et al, 2004: 45-50, 2005: 7, 62, 73). This means that those\u000a      local Road Safety Partnerships which evaluated local drivers' attitudes to\u000a      speed cameras since 2008 as part of their annual road safety audits are\u000a      likely to have continued to use these four statements as part of their\u000a      official evidence base for assessing support for cameras and whether to\u000a      develop coverage of speed cameras in their areas. Hence drivers' responses\u000a      to the four statements have become part of the official barometer to test\u000a      public opinion on cameras. This information is noted by Wells, H. (2010)\u000a      p.66 - 68.\u000a    Secondly, indirect beneficiaries of the Brunel research are the road\u000a      using public because as a result of the increase in speed camera\u000a      installations after the research was published, fewer people have been\u000a      killed or injured as a result of speed-related collisions. This is\u000a      affirmed by Professor Allsop's (2010) review of the effectiveness of speed\u000a      cameras which concluded that taking all factors into consideration, speed\u000a      camera operations prevented around 1,000 people from serious injury or\u000a      being killed in 2004 in Great Britain. He concluded that similar fatality\u000a      savings would be expected in other years. Thus this research has\u000a      ultimately contributed to road casualty reductions since 2008, probably\u000a      around 6,000, through flagging up continued majority support for cameras\u000a      as measured by local SCP audits and hence encouraging and facilitating\u000a      their continued use nationally and now internationally (e.g. Europe, the\u000a      USA and Canada).\u000a    Thirdly, the Brunel research work fed into public debates about the worth\u000a      of speed cameras in saving lives and whether the intention of cameras is\u000a      solely altruistically based and not linked with revenue generation for\u000a      government. The questionnaire dimensions, including the four statements\u000a      mentioned above, tapped into these debates and so contributed towards\u000a      raising public awareness of speed camera enforcement and speeding. The\u000a      topic is still emotive.\u000a    Fourthly, not only have the fruits of the Brunel 1999 research project\u000a      and the 2008 joint Brunel\/TRL study made a `major contribution to the\u000a      evidence base on drivers' responses to speed cameras and penalty points\u000a      for speeding', they also `have helped shape the government's policy\u000a      options and policy development for improving compliance on the roads', as\u000a      acknowledged by Mrs D O'Reilly, Head of Social Research and Evaluation of\u000a      the Department for Transport (see no. 5). For example, the 2008 study\u000a      found that a slight majority of 1100 drivers with different profiles of\u000a      penalty points approved of cameras as a useful means of casualty\u000a      reduction, though a significant minority of them referred to cameras being\u000a      used for revenue-generation rather than collision reduction, possibly\u000a      undermining public confidence in the use of cameras for enforcement. This\u000a      information would have been helpful to government and to local authorities\u000a      and their road safety partnerships in decisions whether to continue to\u000a      operate speed cameras at a time of some public disaffection with cameras\u000a      as expressed in the popular print media.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Corbett's research, which was broadly positive about the introduction of\u000a      speed cameras, informed the DETR decision to roll-out of speed cameras\u000a      nationally. Four statements developed in the research became part of the\u000a      benchmark criteria used to assess public opinion on speed cameras and have\u000a      featured in local audits of attitudes to speed cameras since 2008.\u000a      Subsequent research has concluded that lives have been saved by speed\u000a      camera installation thus Corbett's research has contributed positively to\u000a      national road safety culture.

The Department for\u000a      Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) commissioned at least two\u000a      studies to explore their effectiveness &#8212; one based on objective observed\u000a      data at camera sites, and the other, conducted by Corbett and researchers\u000a      at Brunel's Law Department, based on drivers' self-reported responses to\u000a      different strategies linked with camera deployment and their attitudes to\u000a      cameras.\u000a    The research was funded by a DETR grant, totalling &#163;322,000, between\u000a      1993-1997, awarded to the Department of Law, Brunel University. Four\u000a      Brunel staff members worked on the project: Dr Claire Corbett (lead\u000a      researcher), Dr Frances Simon, Dr Jeff Crick, and Dr Brian Block.\u000a    The study adopted a quasi-experimental design with a series of 12 surveys\u000a      in five police force areas arranged in five sets having some\u000a      cross-sectional and some longitudinal elements. Depth interviews were also\u000a      undertaken. Almost 7,000 drivers took part. The camera interventions\u000a      focused on the impact of camera signing alone, two kinds of publicity\u000a      campaigns, the effect of cameras when first installed and over time, and\u000a      the impact of prosecution following detection by speed camera.\u000a    The results indicated that all measures investigated seemed useful in\u000a      lowering drivers' speed (according to self-report) and most of the effects\u000a      of installation lasted several months. A key feature of the research is\u000a      that an earlier four-part typology of drivers' responses to cameras had\u000a      been devised by Corbett (1995; 2000), and this research was designed\u000a      partly to explore the attitudinal and behavioural responses of different\u000a      types of driver to cameras. The study showed that all four categories\u000a      reduced their speeds somewhat in regard to all deployment strategies and\u000a      all approved of them, though attitudes and behaviours varied. Two of these\u000a      driver categories, `manipulators' and `defiers', presented the most\u000a      concern for road safety, and subsequent discourse has focused around\u000a      manipulators in particular.\u000a    It was also found that the majority of drivers prosecuted for speeding\u000a      via cameras in one survey also supported cameras as a means to encourage\u000a      compliance (), lending support to the widespread approval of cameras at\u000a      that time.\u000a    Other important findings were that drivers' reported speed reductions at\u000a      camera sites generalised to other similar roads (supporting their\u000a      generalised efficacy) and that reduced speeds persisted over time. These\u000a      were positive findings, supporting the subsequent decision to roll-out\u000a      cameras nationally.\u000a    In 2006, Corbett, as lead researcher, and colleagues from the Transport\u000a      Research Laboratory were commissioned by the DfT to conduct research\u000a      designed inter alia to inform understanding of the deterrent\u000a      effect of speed cameras and of the motivations underpinning the behaviour\u000a      of repeat speed offenders (Corbett et al, 2008). This study reinforced\u000a      some key findings from the earlier research, especially that a slight\u000a      majority of convicted speeding drivers with varying patterns of penalty\u000a      points supported the use of speed cameras as a method of casualty\u000a      reduction.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13846","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact on Practitioners;\u000a      The 2009 article has influenced practitioner debate, particularly on the\u000a      issue of the utility of the\u000a      \"informed observer\" in cases of apprehended bias. Holly Stout (11 King's\u000a      Bench Walk) cited the\u000a      article thus; `Indeed, one academic, having listed over some three\u000a        lengthy paragraphs all the\u000a        characteristics that judges have said should be imputed to the\u000a        fair-minded observer, has observed:\u000a        \"If one were to attempt to describe the attributes of the Archangel\u000a        Michael, one could not do much\u000a        better\"', and then proceeded to highlight the difficulties of this\u000a      construct, mirroring many of\u000a      Olowofoyeku's arguments.\u000a    Similarly, Philip Havers QC and Alasdair Henderson (1 Crown Office Row),\u000a      noted that it was\u000a      increasingly becoming apparent that the concept of the \"fair-minded and\u000a      informed observer\" is a\u000a      difficult one to apply in practice. Referring to Olowofoyeku, they noted\u000a      that \"Other commentators\u000a        have conducted a far more exhaustive analysis than is possible here of\u000a        the flaws in the concept\",\u000a      and explicitly adopted Olowofoyeku's critique.\u000a    Thus Olowofoyeku's critique of the informed observer and identification\u000a      of the construct as one that\u000a      is seriously flawed have been accepted and adopted as the new received\u000a      wisdom on the issue of\u000a      bias by practitioners in the field of public law.\u000a    Impact on judicial reasoning and decision-making;\u000a      The \"Bias and the Informed Observer\" article (2009) was cited by\u000a      the High Court of Australia in\u000a      British American Tobacco Australia Services (2011). French CJ\u000a      analysed the development of the\u000a      test for apprehended bias in the UK and Australia, and (at [36]) completed\u000a      that analysis with a\u000a      reference to Olowofoyeku's \"critique of the fair-minded and informed\u000a      observer in Olowofoyeku\u000a      'Bias and the Informed Observer ...\".\u000a    French CJ (at [48]) accepted Olowofoyeku's argument that interposition of\u000a      the fair-minded lay\u000a      person by the common law could never disguise the reality that it is the\u000a      assessment of the court\u000a      dealing with a claim of apparent bias that determines that claim. In so\u000a      doing, French CJ took a\u000a      direct quotation from Olowofoyeku's 2009 article, viz., 'In the end,\u000a        despite the pitch on objectivity\u000a        and the view that the apprehensions of bias must have an objective\u000a        basis, it is the opinion of the\u000a        reviewing court on this issue that matters.'\u000a    Subsequently, French CJ referred to Olowofoyeku's \"view that the\u000a        judicial construct of the informed\u000a        observer no longer provides a reliable guide to decision-making on the\u000a        issue of apparent bias\". His\u000a      response to this argument by Olowofoyeku was that \"the utility of the\u000a        construct is that it reminds\u000a        the judges making such decisions of the need to view the circumstances\u000a        of claimed apparent bias,\u000a        as best they can, through the eyes of non-judicial observers. In so\u000a        doing they will not have\u000a        recourse to all the information that a judge or practising lawyer would\u000a        have. It requires the judges\u000a        to identify the information on which they are to make their\u000a        determinations.\" French CJ conceded,\u000a      in line with Olowofoyeku's arguments, that \"it is necessary to be\u000a        realistic about the limitations of the\u000a        test\", but felt that the test \"retains its utility as a guide to\u000a        decision-making in this difficult area\".\u000a    Olowofoyeku's research has informed judicial decision-making at the\u000a      highest level, and has\u000a      brought to the minds of very senior judges (and, by extension, legal\u000a      practitioners, litigants, and law\u000a      students) the point that long-established common law principles are\u000a      susceptible to serious\u000a      contestations.\u000a    Issues of judicial bias and recusals are topical globally, and decisions\u000a      of the High Court of Australia\u000a      are influential throughout the common law world. Recognition and\u000a      acceptance by the High Court of\u000a      Australia of Olowofoyeku's research in this area, first, as having helped\u000a      to shape the development\u000a      of recusal law, and, secondly, as having strongly challenged the main\u000a      construct (the impartial\u000a      observer) of common law legal systems in this area, extends the reach of\u000a      the impact to virtually the\u000a      entire English-speaking world. In spite of French CJ's view that the\u000a      \"impartial observer\" test retains\u000a      its utility, Olowofoyeku's work has forced courts to confront this large\u000a      chink the armour of the\u000a      common law and to accept that the erstwhile received common law wisdom is\u000a      assailable. It has\u000a      also helped to improve awareness and understanding of the hitherto hidden\u000a      tensions and\u000a      difficulties inherent in a construct that had long remained uncontested.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Olowofoyeku's research on judicial accountability challenges\u000a      long-established norms in the Anglo-\u000a      American legal traditions.

It has postulated that the balance in many cases is unduly\u000a      tilted towards\u000a      independence, at the expense of accountability, and that remedial measures\u000a      are required. His\u000a      monographs \"The Law of Judicial Immunities in Nigeria\" (Spectrum,\u000a      1993), and \"Suing judges\"\u000a      (Oxford, 1993) were the first major outputs of this research, and were\u000a      followed by further outputs in\u000a      scholarly journals and edited collections. These outputs focused on\u000a      judicial accountability via\u000a      liability, and argued that the long-established norms of absolute judicial\u000a      immunity were\u000a      unjustifiable.\u000a    Olowofoyeku's research extends the accountability agenda to issues of\u000a      judicial bias and\u000a      impartiality. Again, it unearthed fundamental flaws in the established\u000a      norms. So in 2000 (Public\u000a        Law), Olowofoyeku uncovered the flaws in the common law principle of\u000a      automatic disqualification\u000a      for bias, both as a general principle of judicial accountability, and,\u000a      more particularly, as extended\u000a      by the House of Lords in the Pinochet case. Subsequently, in two\u000a      journal articles in 2006 (Public\u000a        Law, and Singapore Journal of Legal Studies), he challenged\u000a      the approaches of the US Supreme\u000a      Court to judicial recusals within the Court, and suggested different\u000a      approaches. In a 2009 article\u000a      (CLJ), he examined the modern approach of the House of Lords to\u000a      judicial bias, and challenged\u000a      the common law's main construct in this area - the interposition of the\u000a      \"informed observer\". He\u000a      argued in favour of a return to the discarded approach of the House of\u000a      Lords in R v Gough, in\u000a      which the reviewing court personifies the reasonable person. In a 2012\u000a      article (AJICL), he\u000a      challenged aspects of the recusal law of the East African Court of\u000a      Justice, a sub-regional court that\u000a      sought to extend the common law judicial bias jurisprudence into the\u000a      sub-regional space.\u000a    The outputs presenting Olowofoyeku's research are substantial, original,\u000a      scholarly, pieces which\u000a      have been and are still being cited widely in the academic literature. The\u000a      research has also been\u000a      cited by legal practitioners and judges. For example, the 2000 Nemo\u000a        iudex article was cited in De\u000a      Smith's Judicial Review (6th edn., 2007, p.515); by The Rt. Hon.

The\u000a      research influenced the outcome of this case, but not only that. It also\u000a      provided the basis for a judicial widening of the applicable definition of\u000a      `children's welfare' in relevantly similar cases. The decision therefore\u000a      also exerts force in cognate areas of law. The influence of Herring's\u000a      research also extended beyond its impact on legal authority. In the\u000a      professional media and in a variety of blogs, the decision and the new\u000a      idea of children's welfare were debated by lawyers and others, leading to\u000a      a better informed discussion of a difficult and sometimes controversial\u000a      area of social policy.\u000a    In Re G, involving the upbringing of five children, Lord Justice Munby in\u000a      the Court of Appeal gave reasons with which Sir Stephen Sedley and Lord\u000a      Justice Kay agreed. The children's families had for generations been part\u000a      of the Hassidic or Chareidi Jewish community. The marriage broke down; as\u000a      a result, the father wanted the children to attend an ultra-orthodox\u000a      school, whilst the mother wanted the children to attend a non-orthodox\u000a      school from which they would be able to pursue higher education and have\u000a      greater opportunities. Both mother and father accepted that the mother's\u000a      decision would lead to a significant change of lifestyle.\u000a    A Child and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) report\u000a      was produced, which concluded it was in the best interests of the children\u000a      to live with the mother, and to attend the schools of her choice. Judge\u000a      Copley, at Willesden County Court, accepted the CAFCASS report. In the\u000a      Court of Appeal the father argued that the Judge had attached too much\u000a      weight to educational opportunity, and failed to take account of the\u000a      Chareidi lifestyle. Munby LJ, quoted from Herring and Foster's work,\u000a      upheld the judge's decision, and dismissed the father's appeal. Citing [R2]\u000a      he held:\u000a    `The well-being of a child cannot be assessed in isolation. Human beings\u000a      live within a network of relationships. Men and women are sociable beings.\u000a      (...) As Herring and Foster comment, relationships are central to our\u000a      sense and understanding of ourselves. Our characters and understandings of\u000a      ourselves from the earliest days are charted by reference to our\u000a      relationships with others. It is only by considering the child's network\u000a      of relationships that their well-being can be properly considered.

He conducts research into criminal, family and medical law. In\u000a      a series of works of doctrinal and theoretical analysis, Herring brought\u000a      to bear ideas from branches of feminist ethical theory that elaborate an\u000a      `ethic of care' and emphasise `relational' values. An early test of the\u000a      application of these concepts in the law was published in his noted paper\u000a      `The Human Rights Act and the Welfare Principle in Family Law &#8212;\u000a      Conflicting or Complementary' [1999] [R6], which was then followed\u000a      by a series of articles, and finally culminated in a comprehensive\u000a      treatment in his recent monograph, Caring and the Law (2013) [R1].\u000a      Charles Foster is a Fellow of Green Templeton College, Oxford, a Research\u000a      Associate at the Ethox and HeLEX Centres, University of Oxford, and a\u000a      practising barrister. He collaborated with Herring in writing the paper [R2]\u000a      which built on Herring's individual research, and was later relied on by\u000a      the Court of Appeal.\u000a    The concepts of `welfare' and `best interests' play a central role\u000a      throughout medical and family law. The conventional view has been that the\u000a      courts are expected to make best interests determinations by looking solely\u000a      at the interests of the child, ignoring the impact of the decision on\u000a      anyone else. Herring's research argues that, even though welfare is\u000a      commonly presented in individualistic terms and seems to require the court\u000a      to promote the interests of a child or incompetent adult without reference\u000a      to the interests of others, this is misleading. Properly understood, `best\u000a      interests' and `welfare' can be, and should be, taken as concepts that\u000a      recognise the importance of relational interests, the performance of\u000a      obligations, and even the cultivation of other-regarding virtues, such as\u000a      altruism. Moreover, Herring shows that this is not only a more defensible\u000a      view, it is also one that is available to the courts, and is consistent\u000a      with the animating principles of English law in this area [R1, R6].\u000a    The precise aim of Herring's research was to make explicit which\u000a      conceptions of welfare were, could be, and should be used by the courts.\u000a      This work includes analyses of (i) a person's well-being and whether it\u000a      requires decisions to be made which will primarily benefit only him or\u000a      benefit (or appear primarily to benefit) another person; and (ii) whether\u000a      the well-being of a person can be assessed in isolation, or should be\u000a      considered in the context of the network of relationships within which a\u000a      person lives [R2, R5]. Herring and Foster's deployment of this\u000a      theory challenged the prevailing assumption that deciding what is in a\u000a      person's welfare or best interests involves considering solely matters\u000a      relating to them, or the impact of the decision on them [R2].\u000a      Herring's account is defended on the basis of normative and conceptual\u000a      arguments that are shown to be compelling in principle and doctrinally\u000a      available. In the leading case examined here, these arguments met with\u000a      judicial approval and helped shape the key ruling.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14595","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1282588","Name":"British Indian Ocean Territory"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The UK has residual legal responsibilities for some Overseas Territories\u000d\u000a      in which the royal prerogative authorises Her Majesty to legislate by\u000d\u000a      Order in Council. The scope of this authority, including the objects for\u000d\u000a      which it may properly be exercised, is of fundamental constitutional\u000d\u000a      importance, as is the related question of on what grounds, if at all, the\u000d\u000a      courts may review the exercise of this authority. John Finnis`s research\u000d\u000a      on the boundaries of political communities and the nature of the `common\u000d\u000a      good' was found helpful by the House of Lords in deciding these questions.\u000d\u000a      His arguments are expressly reflected in a critical ruling, and then\u000d\u000a      relied upon again in other judgements. Finnis` work helped reshape an\u000d\u000a      aspect of constitutional law affecting everyone in the UK and its Overseas\u000d\u000a      Territories.\u000d\u000a    In the Bancoult (No 2) litigation [C1], English courts\u000d\u000a      were invited to quash an exercise (or purported exercise) of the\u000d\u000a      prerogative power to legislate, reinstating restrictions on entry and\u000d\u000a      residence in the British Indian Ocean Territory; these restrictions, made\u000d\u000a      by Order in Council, had been struck down four years earlier in separate\u000d\u000a      litigation. The restrictions, which excluded the Chagos Islanders from\u000d\u000a      returning to the territory, had been introduced to facilitate the building\u000d\u000a      and maintaining of a US military base at Diego Garcia, with the agreement\u000d\u000a      of the UK Government.\u000d\u000a    The Court of Appeal upheld the Divisional Court`s decision to grant the\u000d\u000a      application and to quash the Order in Council: R (Bancoult) v.\u000d\u000a        Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2)\u000d\u000a      [2007] EWCA Civ 498, [2008] QB 365. The Court of Appeal reasoned first\u000d\u000a      that the CLVA did not block the application, and second that the Order had\u000d\u000a      improperly been made in the interests of the UK itself rather than the\u000d\u000a      territory in question, for whose good the power should instead have been\u000d\u000a      exercised.\u000d\u000a    In the important and controversial final decision in Bancoult [C1]\u000d\u000a      the House of Lords reversed the Court of Appeal`s judgment, narrowly\u000d\u000a      upholding the legality of the Order. Counsel for the appellant relied on\u000d\u000a      Finnis`s paper, `Common Law Constraints: Whose Common Good Counts?' [R5]\u000d\u000a      and counsel for the respondent sought to answer that paper in argument\u000d\u000a      before the court. The paper is quoted with approval a number of times in\u000d\u000a      the leading judgment of Lord Hoffmann [paras.37-39] and also in the\u000d\u000a      concurring judgment of Lord Rodger in paragraphs approved also by Lord\u000d\u000a      Carswell.\u000d\u000a    In paragraph 39, Lord Hoffmann relies on Finnis`s refutation of the Court\u000d\u000a      of Appeal`s interpretation of the CLVA. In paragraph 47, Lord Hoffmann\u000d\u000a      rejects the argument that Her Majesty must exercise her powers of\u000d\u000a      prerogative legislation solely in the interests of the territory in\u000d\u000a      question. Rather, he says, this power is to be exercised upon the advice\u000d\u000a      of her ministers in the United Kingdom who properly act in the interests\u000d\u000a      of the undivided realm which includes the UK and the territory. Hoffman`s\u000d\u000a      authority for this proposition is paragraph 716 of Halsbury's [R4],\u000d\u000a      written by Finnis, which he quotes at length (in his paragraph 31, he also\u000d\u000a      quotes paragraph 823 of Halsbury's). Immediately thereafter, in\u000d\u000a      paragraph 48, he says that having read Professor Finnis`s paper he is now\u000d\u000a      inclined to think his earlier reasoning in the Quark case was not\u000d\u000a      sound. (R (Quark Fishing Ltd) v Secretary of State for Foreign and\u000d\u000a        Commonwealth Affairs [2005] UKHL 57, [2006] 1 AC 529) Thus, writing\u000d\u000a      for the majority, Lord Hoffmann adopted Finnis`s account of the\u000d\u000a      constitutional relationship between the UK and its overseas territories\u000d\u000a      (and its rationale, namely, that they have one common good) and\u000d\u000a      followed Finnis, thus reversing his own position in Quark, to\u000d\u000a      affirm the constitutional principle that prerogative legislation may\u000d\u000a      properly be made in the interests of the undivided realm. Hence, the\u000d\u000a      challenge to the Order failed.\u000d\u000a    Lord Rodger in paragraph 98 also notes and adopts Finnis`s answer to the\u000d\u000a      Court of Appeal`s argument that unless the CLVA is narrowly interpreted\u000d\u000a      the courts will not be able to correct some injustices. Lord Rodger\u000d\u000a      expressly agrees with Finnis`s explanation of the point and legal effect\u000d\u000a      of the CLVA, and so overturns the Court of Appeal`s judgment on point.\u000d\u000a      (Lord Carswell follows Lord Rodger`s analysis at paragraph 126). Finnis`s\u000d\u000a      authoritative refutation of the main lines of argument in the Court of\u000d\u000a      Appeal judgment proved decisive, persuading a narrow majority to reject\u000d\u000a      the confused proposition that in legislating for the UK`s dependencies Her\u000d\u000a      Majesty, acting on advice of her responsible ministers in the UK, may not\u000d\u000a      act for the good of the UK and its dependencies, which form one realm. In\u000d\u000a      all, Lords Hoffman, Roger, and Carswell make heavy reliance on the\u000d\u000a      critical arguments of Professor Finnis [C5].\u000d\u000a    The holding in Quark was not strictly overruled in Bancoult\u000d\u000a        (No 2), it being common ground in the latter case that the Order in\u000d\u000a      Council was made by Her Majesty in right of the United Kingdom. However,\u000d\u000a      it is clear from the Barclay litigation [C2, C3] that\u000d\u000a      Finnis`s paper has persuaded the superior courts that the holding is\u000d\u000a      untenable. (Barclay) v Secretary of State for Justice [2008] EWCA\u000d\u000a      Civ 1319, [2009] 2 WLR 1205 at paragraph 21 noted that Lord Hoffmann`s\u000d\u000a      remarks in Bancoult undercut Quark. At paragraph 106, Phil\u000d\u000a      LJ noted Lord Hoffmann`s reliance on Finnis`s paper, and then quoted from\u000d\u000a      that paper, tacitly affirming his proposition, contra Quark, that\u000d\u000a      in giving instructions Her Majesty acted in right not only of her\u000d\u000a      dependent territory but also and indeed primarily in right of the UK,\u000d\u000a      which forms one undivided realm. When Barclay reached the Supreme\u000d\u000a      Court on appeal [C3], the leading judgment of Lord Collins (with\u000d\u000a      whom all their Lordships concurred) says, also at paragraph 106, that the\u000d\u000a      authority of the majority in Quark was weakened by Lord Hoffmann`s\u000d\u000a      statement in Bancoult, and that in light of Finnis`s paper\u000d\u000a      criticising the decision of the Lords in Quark and the Court of\u000d\u000a      Appeal in Bancoult, he thought Lord Nicholls right. So while the\u000d\u000a      Supreme Court did not strictly overrule Quark in Barclay,\u000d\u000a      as the question did not need to be decided and had not been properly\u000d\u000a      argued, the Barclay judgment makes clear that Quark is now\u000d\u000a      of dubious authority, and is very likely to be formally overruled in due\u000d\u000a      course.\u000d\u000a    Finally, in the Kenya colonial torture litigation [C4]\u000d\u000a      proceedings in the High Court in London in 2011, the paper [R5]\u000d\u000a      was cited to the court by the claimants and referred to with approval in\u000d\u000a      several paragraphs of the court`s judgment: Mutua v Foreign and\u000d\u000a        Commonwealth Office [2011] EWHC 1913 (QB) at paragraphs 63, 64. The\u000d\u000a      paper was also attached to the United Kingdom`s case in Chagos\u000d\u000a        Islanders v United Kingdom in the European Court of Human Rights, in\u000d\u000a      which the court, by a majority, ruled that as the Chagossians had accepted\u000d\u000a      compensation from the UK, they had effectively renounced their `right to\u000d\u000a      return' and as such their case was inadmissible [C6].\u000d\u000a    Thus, John Finnis`s work was decisive in persuading a majority of the\u000d\u000a      House of Lords in Bancoult to restore the central constitutional\u000d\u000a      principle governing the relationship between the UK and its dependencies,\u000d\u000a      which bears on the scope of Her Majesty`s prerogative power to legislate.\u000d\u000a      The paper persuaded Lord Hoffmann to abandon his earlier position in Quark,\u000d\u000a      concerning the capacity in which Her Majesty acts in her dependencies&#8212;this\u000d\u000a      change of mind will very likely culminate, as subsequent cases suggest and\u000d\u000a      confirm, in the Supreme Court expressly overruling Quark when a\u000d\u000a      suitable case presents itself. Channelling many years` work on the\u000d\u000a      fundamental principles that govern the constitutional and lawful rule of a\u000d\u000a      complex political community, Finnis`s argument constitutes a very powerful\u000d\u000a      intervention in legal discourse, helping rescue the courts from the\u000d\u000a      confusion that Professor Finnis identified in Quark and in the\u000d\u000a      minority and Court of Appeal judgments in Bancoult.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor John Finnis has been engaged in a programme of research in\u000d\u000a      legal and constitutional theory. His work on the legal and political\u000d\u000a      responsibilities of UK ministers when acting to affect the law of a\u000d\u000a      British Overseas Territory played a pivotal role in the decision of the\u000d\u000a      House of Lords to reverse the Court of Appeal`s interpretation of the\u000d\u000a      Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 (CVLA). The Court of Appeal had held that\u000d\u000a      UK ministers could not properly legislate in the interests of the\u000d\u000a      UK as a whole (including its dependent territories), but only in the\u000d\u000a      interests of the particular territory itself. Relying on Finnis`s\u000d\u000a      arguments, the House of Lords changed that precept. Finnis`s work also\u000d\u000a      persuaded members of the House of Lords to express doubts about a central\u000d\u000a      holding of an earlier decision, which concerned the capacity in which\u000d\u000a      ministers acted in legislating in dependent territories.

His book, Aquinas\u000d\u000a      [R1], examined political principles fundamental to law and\u000d\u000a      government, including the nature of justice, human rights, and the rule of\u000d\u000a      law. His paper `Boundaries' [R2] considered some of the social\u000d\u000a      conditions needed for a political community to have sufficient unity to be\u000d\u000a      ruled well, arguing that the relationships of the political community and\u000d\u000a      its citizens with the territory it holds as its own are strongly analogous\u000d\u000a      to legal property rights. Fundamental to both, Finnis argued, is the idea\u000d\u000a      that non-citizens\/non-owners may enter only with permission; this right to\u000d\u000a      exclude is conducive to the promotion of justice and human rights\u000d\u000a      worldwide.\u000d\u000a    The constitutional implications of these reflections were then considered\u000d\u000a      in his `Nationality and Alienage' paper [R3], which explored the\u000d\u000a      distinction between nationals and aliens in the common law, with a view to\u000d\u000a      determining its relevance to the judicial review of detention pending\u000d\u000a      deportation. The paper combined a close study of the relevant legal\u000d\u000a      history, elucidating and evaluating its principles and continuity, with\u000d\u000a      sharp technical analysis of recent legal materials. The paper elucidated\u000d\u000a      the constitutional principle of nationality and made clear the dangers of\u000d\u000a      judicial neglect of this principle. Finnis also completed the entry on\u000d\u000a      `Commonwealth and Dependencies' in the 2003 reissue of Halsbury's Laws\u000d\u000a        of England [R4], which is a comprehensive and authoritative\u000d\u000a      statement of English law. In this work, Finnis examined the constitutional\u000d\u000a      law of the members of the Commonwealth, attending especially to the\u000d\u000a      constitutional law and principles concerning the relationship between the\u000d\u000a      UK and its dependencies (now called British Overseas Territories).\u000d\u000a    These lines of scholarship came together in his study `Common Law\u000d\u000a      Constraints: Whose Common Good Counts?' [R5], a paper written for\u000d\u000a      a conference organised by the Centre for Public Law at the University of\u000d\u000a      Cambridge in January 2008 to consider aspects of the decisions of the\u000d\u000a      Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal in the (Bancoult) (No. 2)\u000d\u000a      litigation. This paper was delivered at the conference attended by legal\u000d\u000a      representatives of both parties to the then imminent House of Lords\u000d\u000a      hearing, creating a two-way dialogue with the counsel in the case. Finnis\u000d\u000a      had no prior (or subsequent) involvement of any kind with the litigation\u000d\u000a      or those involved in it. His paper [R5] examined the origin, point\u000d\u000a      and legal effect of the CLVA, refuting the Court of Appeal`s\u000d\u000a      interpretation of that Act and also its interpretation of the authorities\u000d\u000a      concerning `peace, order and good government'. The paper then considered\u000d\u000a      the constitutional understanding at work in the recent Quark\u000d\u000a      judgment, arguing that it misstated the constitutional position of\u000d\u000a      Ministers of the Crown, and confused the relationship between the UK and\u000d\u000a      overseas territories. Finnis argued that in constitutional law and\u000d\u000a      principle, and supported by arguments in legal theory that he had\u000d\u000a      developed over many years, the UK and those territories form one undivided\u000d\u000a      realm with one common good, for which Ministers properly act in\u000d\u000a      legislating in a particular territory.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14596","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"3573591","Name":"Trinidad and Tobago"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research on the death penalty carried out over the past two decades by\u000a      Professor Hood, and,\u000a      latterly, also by Professor Hoyle, has generated debates on reform and\u000a      influenced the thinking and\u000a      practices of criminal justice professionals and policy makers worldwide,\u000a      including in Taiwan,\u000a      Malaysia, Japan, India, Ghana, Uganda, and Trinidad and Tobago. Their most\u000a      recent, and perhaps\u000a      most important, influence has been in China. As one Chinese reformer puts\u000a      it, `their research has\u000a      had a significant impact on the debate on the death penalty in China and\u000a      ... is one of the\u000a      contributing factors to changing policy;' and `We use [their research] to\u000a      help us to present our\u000a      views when lobbying policy makers or working with other pressure groups to\u000a      influence policy\u000a      makers in China.' [C1]\u000a    China is cautiously becoming more receptive to research and international\u000a      influence, but it remains\u000a      a fairly closed and secretive jurisdiction. Among various drivers for\u000a      reform, research has proved\u000a      influential where it is able to reach academics enjoying close\u000a      relationships with the Party. Several\u000a      Western academics joined in articulating the international human rights\u000a      message, but Hood and\u000a      Hoyle's research is the only international academic work to be widely\u000a      disseminated among\u000a      Chinese academics, policy makers and practitioners in both closed and open\u000a      fora. The Death\u000a        Penalty [R1] has been translated into Chinese (by Liu Renwen\u000a      and Zhou Renjie) and published by\u000a      the China People's Policy Study University Press (3rd ed. 2005,\u000a      4th ed. 2010). In a society where\u000a      the press is closely regulated, this is indicative of official endorsement\u000a      by the Chinese Government.\u000a      Another Chinese academic and party member writes,\u000a    `Due to the imperfections of the criminal justice statistics and judicial\u000a      transparency in China,\u000a      Chinese academic circles are mainly making the theoretical or normative\u000a      analyses regarding\u000a      the death penalty, and there are few empirical researches on the death\u000a      penalty. To a certain\u000a      extent, the researches [sic] conducted by Professors Hood and Hoyle can\u000a      make up that gap\u000a      in the study of death penalty. Given the excellent research and the\u000a      international\/comparative\u000a      perspective, many Chinese scholars or institutions, including me and my\u000a      organization ...have\u000a      found it useful to cite this research in order to better understand or\u000a      further illuminate some\u000a      problems.' [C2].\u000a    Likewise, many international reform groups have come to rely on Hood and\u000a      Hoyle, especially when\u000a      working in the Asian context. The Director of the charity Reprieve,\u000a      reports `I am certainly familiar\u000a      with the research conducted by Professors Hood and Hoyle at Oxford\u000a      University. (...) we use this\u000a      to help us develop our approach to various cases. For example we have had\u000a      two capital cases in\u000a      China in the last four years...and it has been useful to us in assessing\u000a      how to proceed in a very\u000a      tricky legal environment.' [C3]. The UK All Party Parliamentary\u000a      Group on Abolition of the Death\u000a      Penalty likewise notes \"Their work has informed [our] visits to these\u000a      countries and facilitated a\u000a      dialogue within those governments on adherence to UN treaties, the issues\u000a      of deterrence and\u000a      public opinion, and a focus on death row cases.\" [C4]. The\u000a      directors of the Death Penalty Project\u000a      similarly attest to its value and influence on the ground in the making of\u000a      the case to Chinese policy\u000a      makers [C5].\u000a    Hood's work has been reaching China for some time. He was responsible for\u000a      the UN Secretary\u000a      General's reports on the 5th, 6th and 7th\u000a      Quinquennial Surveys of Capital Punishment from 1995 to\u000a      2005; a member of the Foreign Secretary's Death Penalty Advisory Panel in\u000a      2000; an active\u000a      participant in the highly successful UK\/China Human Rights Dialogues and\u000a      the EU\/China Human\u000a      Rights Seminars; a consultant to the Great Britain &#8212; China Centre (GBCC)\u000a      on various projects,\u000a      including `Strengthening the Defence in Death Penalty Cases' and `Moving\u000a      the Debate Forward' on\u000a      the death penalty in China. The research basis of these works drew on\u000a      various editions of The\u000a        Death Penalty; his engagement with Chinese policy makers later fed\u000a      into subsequent research,\u000a      solely, and with Hoyle [C2]. Building on that engagement with\u000a      Chinese policy makers, Hood was\u000a      one of just three external experts invited by the Chinese Ministry of\u000a      Foreign Affairs to take part in\u000a      the first ground breaking seminar on the death penalty to be held with the\u000a      Office of the UN High\u000a      Commissioner for Human Rights, in 2011. This work involved visiting China\u000a      regularly and\u000a      presenting his research and engaging in dialogue, arguing for reform, with\u000a      Supreme Court and\u000a      high court judges, prosecutors, defence lawyers, government advisors, and\u000a      leading academics\u000a      across China. Most recently, he prepared a Report for the European Union,\u000a      drawing on The Death\u000a        Penalty [R1], examining how further reforms to the death\u000a      penalty in Asia might be encouraged.\u000a      The Report was published by the Directorate-General of the European\u000a      Parliament [C6], was\u000a      circulated among European policy makers, and commented on in Asia.[C7]\u000a    From 2006 to 2009, Hood and Hoyle's research also reached senior members\u000a      of the Chinese\u000a      judiciary, including judges of the Supreme People's Court in Beijing.\u000a        [C5] Hoyle was consulted as\u000a      an expert for the GBCC and as the expert consultant to the 2012-15 EU\u000a      Initiative for Democracy\u000a      and Human Rights programme ``Use Less' &#8212; Judicial Restraints on the Use of\u000a      the Death Penalty in\u000a      China'. There she participated in seminars with senior criminal justice\u000a      practitioners, academics and\u000a      policy makers, drawing on the scholarship in The Death Penalty [R1]\u000a      to inform her audiences and\u000a      promote its human rights message, including, for example, influence on\u000a      judicial education in China\u000a      in seminars organised by the Great Britain China Centre. In 2010, Hoyle\u000a      was invited to lecture to\u000a      hundreds of judges in training from across China. The lecture was\u000a      reproduced within the course\u000a      materials and used regularly in the training of further cohorts of judges,\u000a      enhancing judicial\u000a      awareness of the case for reform and progressive restriction of the death\u000a      penalty.\u000a    At a 2009 EU workshop held in Guangdong and Beijing, many delegates\u000a      accepted that the human\u000a      rights movement for worldwide abolition amounts to an `irreversible\u000a      trend'. At the meeting, Chinese\u000a      lawyers, who are not only academics but also members of the Communist\u000a      Party, including\u000a      Professor Zhao Bingzhi, from Beijing Normal University, and Professor Mo\u000a      Hongxian of Wuhan\u000a      University endorsed Hood and Hoyle's claim (in The Death Penalty)\u000a      that the international tide and\u000a      trend towards abolition was `exciting', inevitable and signalled the\u000a      broad-mindedness of civilised\u000a      countries. They argued that abolition had become an international\u000a      obligation and echoed Hood and\u000a      Hoyle's calls for restriction, reform and greater openness. These players\u000a      and others have made\u000a      clear that their own proposals are greatly influenced by Hood and Hoyle's\u000a      research [R1, R5] that is\u000a      now available throughout China [C1, C2].\u000a    Reform, aimed at limiting the scope and practice of capital punishment in\u000a      China, eventually\u000a      resulted in dramatic changes. The Chinese delegate at the United Nations\u000a      Human Rights Council\u000a      declared, in 2007, that `The death penalty's scope of application was to\u000a      be reviewed shortly ... with\u000a      the final aim of abolishment'. Soon after, in 2007, the Supreme People's\u000a      Court (SPC) of China\u000a      assumed the power to review every capital sentence handed down by an\u000a      inferior court. These\u000a      early declarations gave rise to more dramatic moves in recent years. SPC\u000a      members confirmed that\u000a      the number of executions per year has more than halved since this reform;\u000a      that the SPC had\u000a      overturned about 10-15% of all death sentences since then, and provisional\u000a      high courts overturned\u000a      more death sentences at appeal (also widely reported in China Daily,\u000a      gaining further popular\u000a      attention). At a 2012 conference a representative of the SPC's Research\u000a      Department said that the\u000a      Oxford research had been important in leading to these changes and that\u000a      the SPC wanted\u000a      continued academic support for their efforts to further restrict the use\u000a      of the death penalty.\u000a      Delegates at the conference, including members of the Chinese judiciary,\u000a      legal profession, and\u000a      policy makers, acknowledged the role of the Foreign and Commonwealth\u000a      Office and the European\u000a      Union (particularly Hood's research) in promoting these reforms. Further\u000a      restriction of the use of\u000a      capital punishment came in February 2011 when China abolished the death\u000a      penalty for 13 non-violent\u000a      crimes, thereby reducing the number of crimes punishable by death from 68\u000a      to 55. The\u000a      revised Criminal Law also banned capital punishment for offenders over the\u000a      age of 75. Important in\u000a      themselves, these are also emblematic of China's emerging commitment to\u000a      reform.\u000a    According to the Executive Directors of The Death Penalty Project, the\u000a      research of Roger Hood\u000a      and Carolyn Hoyle has proved to be `an essential resource' for the work of\u000a      organisations\u000a      attempting to reform the use of capital punishment in China and elsewhere\u000a      [C5]. Through the\u000a      translation and dissemination of their careful studies, their direct\u000a      engagement with policy makers,\u000a      and their involvement in judicial education, it has proved an important\u000a      factor contributing to the\u000a      reform of the death penalty throughout China [C1, C2].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professors Carolyn Hoyle and Roger Hood have, since 1988, carried out\u000a      wide-ranging comparative\u000a      research in Oxford on the death penalty. Their work has had impact in\u000a      several countries, including\u000a      Trinidad, India, Uganda, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Most recently, it\u000a      is acknowledged as having\u000a      contributed to reforms of the death penalty in China, the main case\u000a      discussed here. In February\u000a      2011, China abolished the death penalty for 13 non-violent crimes, thereby\u000a      reducing the number of\u000a      crimes punishable by death from 68 to 55. Various influences shaped these\u000a      changes, and in a\u000a      society where access to academic work is highly restricted, the influence\u000a      of most foreign research\u000a      inevitably has been minimal.

Together\u000a      they have undertaken the only sustained, cross-national study of factors\u000a      that influence changes in\u000a      the scope and application of capital punishment. Their books, reports and\u000a      articles (often in\u000a      translation) are leading academic works, and are also relied on by NGOs,\u000a      lawyers and\u000a      governments around the world.\u000a    Each edition of The Death Penalty, originally funded by the\u000a      United Nations, (1st ed. 1996; 4th ed.\u000a      2008) studies worldwide movements to reform, restrict and abolish the\u000a      death penalty [R1]. Hood\u000a      and Hoyle draw on primary research and secondary sources as well as on\u000a      their own experiences\u000a      of participating in debates and seminars in retentionist jurisdictions,\u000a      including China, Taiwan,\u000a      Trinidad, India, Uganda, Malaysia, the US, and until abolition was\u000a      achieved, the Philippines. The\u000a      fourth edition provides new compelling evidence that human rights abuses &#8212;\u000a      particularly, failures to\u000a      meet safeguards in international human rights treaties &#8212; are associated\u000a      with continued use of the\u000a      death penalty. This edition engages the latest debates on deterrence,\u000a      whether capital punishment\u000a      can ever be used without discrimination or error, the weight that should\u000a      be placed on public\u000a      opinion, including that of the relatives of victims, and the problem of\u000a      devising alternatives to capital\u000a      punishment [R1].\u000a    Hood and Hoyle argue in that work that the extraordinary changes over the\u000a      past twenty-five years\u000a      can be understood in terms of a new human rights dynamic. That complex\u000a      process includes:\u000a      democratization in Europe; freedom from colonial and post-colonial\u000a      repression in Africa and\u000a      elsewhere; the emergence of democratically inspired Constitutions in many\u000a      countries; and,\u000a      especially, the insertion into international human rights covenants and\u000a      treaties distinct protocols\u000a      aiming at worldwide abolition of the death penalty. This `new human rights\u000a      dynamic' is not only an\u000a      analytical framework for their research, but a normative position that\u000a      emphasizes the right to life\u000a      and the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading\u000a      treatment or punishment.\u000a    Much of the recent research by Hood and Hoyle [R2, R3] further\u000a      argues that the human rights\u000a      approach is inconsistent with even the most persistent of justifications\u000a      for capital punishment:\u000a      retribution and the need to denounce and expiate through execution those\u000a      whose crimes shock\u000a      society by their brutality [R2]. Their research also refutes the\u000a      utilitarian claim that nothing less\u000a      severe can act as a sufficient deterrent to those who contemplate\u000a      committing capital crimes [R1].\u000a      Hood and Hoyle demonstrate that, however it is administered, a system of\u000a      capital punishment\u000a      invariably fails to meet the standards of equal, effective, procedurally\u000a      correct, error-free and\u000a      humane justice that are required by international human rights norms [R1].\u000a      Drawing on Hood's\u000a      reform work in China (conducted under the auspices of the EU), it explores\u000a      in detail the ways that\u000a      China may restrict and control the number of executions [R5, R4].\u000a      Though empirically grounded,\u000a      the research is at the same time a route-map for reform, and one aimed at\u000a      promoting the restriction\u000a      and, ultimately, abolition of the death penalty.

Detailed legislative provisions attempting to curb\u000d\u000a      avoidance often fail. Though struggling with such problems, professionals\u000d\u000a      and administrators in the British tax community were sceptical about the\u000d\u000a      value of an anti-avoidance rule, and rejected that approach in\u000d\u000a      1998. Freedman's research, published in leading academic outlets and\u000d\u000a      widely disseminated in practitioner journals and presentations to\u000d\u000a      professionals, showed that an anti-avoidance norm need not be rule-based [R1,\u000a        R5]. Her principle-based alternative kept anti-avoidance on the\u000d\u000a      public agenda even when such rules had lost favour, and demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      there is an effective and coherent alternative.\u000d\u000a    Freedman showed the possibility and feasibility of a substantive,\u000d\u000a      overriding legislative principle which was based not on a motive\u000d\u000a      test but on listed objective characteristics, and was accompanied by\u000d\u000a      administrative arrangements encouraging debate between the tax community\u000d\u000a      and the revenue authorities. Freedman's research and role in these debates\u000d\u000a      led to an invitation to serve on the Aaronson study group appointed to\u000d\u000a      advise the Exchequer Secretary. She disseminated her research and the work\u000d\u000a      of the group through a major conference she organised under the auspices\u000d\u000a      of the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation (OUCBT) in February\u000d\u000a      2012, in London. The 270 attendees included academics, tax professionals\u000d\u000a      and key officials. The proposals of the Aaronson study group informed\u000d\u000a      legislation in the Finance Act 2013 which now reflects ideas set out in\u000d\u000a      Freedman's work.\u000d\u000a    Engagement with policy-makers and tax practitioners has been central to\u000d\u000a      Freedman's research. A prominent financial journalist has said of\u000d\u000a      Freedman, `Your willingness to engage with journalists, policy makers and\u000d\u000a      others, including NGOs &#8212; is very important in shaping the debate. You'd\u000d\u000a      definitely be one of the most influential commentators in the field and I\u000d\u000a      do quite often draw on articles you have written.' [C9] Working\u000d\u000a      with professionals, as with the Aaronson study group, enabled a timely\u000d\u000a      exchange of knowledge in tax law and policy. The key findings, here, were\u000d\u000a      Freedman's explanation of why rule-based regulation is likely to\u000d\u000a      fail, and how a principle-based alternative could be constructed.\u000d\u000a      She went on to address concerns among policy makers and lawyers about the\u000d\u000a      potential for uncertainty in tax law and explained how that could be\u000d\u000a      managed by relying on objective characteristics of transactions and\u000d\u000a      through an appropriate administrative framework to control revenue\u000d\u000a      discretion. The specific influence of Freedman's work on this process has\u000d\u000a      been acknowledged even by those who had been critical of the OUCBT,\u000d\u000a      including a noted tax campaigner in a `Tax Research UK' blog-post, who\u000d\u000a      wrote, `It took a long time, a lot of lobbying and some luck to\u000d\u000a      get a general anti-avoidance rule (or General Anti-Abuse Rule as it now\u000d\u000a      is) onto any government's agenda in the UK. Judith Freedman at the Oxford\u000d\u000a      Centre for Business Taxation worked on that call.' [C4]\u000d\u000a    In 2010, the Coalition Government agreed to reflect the Liberal\u000d\u000a      Democrats' views by considering an anti-avoidance measure. HMRC and HMT\u000d\u000a      held a series of workshops, one of which Freedman was invited to address\u000d\u000a      (written up in The Tax Journal, 27th Sept. 2010). The Exchequer\u000d\u000a      Secretary appointed Graham Aaronson QC to set up a study group to advise\u000d\u000a      the Government on the introduction of a GAAR, and at Aaronson's request,\u000d\u000a      Freedman was appointed as one of only two academic members of that group,\u000d\u000a      to contribute her knowledge and analysis of GAARs in overseas\u000d\u000a      jurisdictions. The 2011 Aaronson Report, though his alone, reflected the\u000d\u000a      research and views of the Group [C5, C8]. Aaronson has said of\u000d\u000a      Freedman, `You were one of the keyest of key members of the study group,\u000d\u000a      and you had a great influence on my thinking.' [C8]\u000d\u000a    The Report advocated a moderate and targeted anti-abuse principle. Though\u000d\u000a      referring to it as a GAAR (since that is the acronym familiar in other\u000d\u000a      jurisdictions) the new proposal is in substance a principle: `an\u000d\u000a      overriding statutory principle to which other tax legislation is subject'\u000d\u000a      [C5, para 5.4], echoing Freedman's proposal in [R4,\u000d\u000a      at 75] and in [R1 at 356]: `This is not to say that\u000d\u000a      the specific statute is to be ignored; rather that it will be modified by\u000d\u000a      the GAAR explicitly subjecting it to an overriding principle or\u000d\u000a      principles.' Similarly, Aaronson's proposal for a statutory advisory panel\u000d\u000a      adopts the idea set out in [R1 at 457] for an overarching\u000d\u000a      administrative framework.\u000d\u000a    Following the publication of draft anti-avoidance legislation in the\u000d\u000a      Finance Bill, Freedman gave evidence to the House of Lords Select\u000d\u000a      Committee on Economic Affairs which scrutinised the Finance Bill (HL Paper\u000d\u000a      139). An anti-avoidance measure, largely as proposed by Aaronson and\u000d\u000a      influenced by Freedman's work, was consequently enacted in the Finance Act\u000d\u000a      2013, sections 206- 215 and Schedule 43 and is now in force [C6].\u000d\u000a      It has a broad overarching effect on all tax law and, thus, liabilities in\u000d\u000a      the UK, and is attracting notice as a potential solution to similar\u000d\u000a      problems elsewhere, including taxes within the jurisdiction of the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Parliament. A Scottish official wrote, \"Your 2007 article\u000d\u000a      `Interpreting Tax Statutes: Tax Avoidance and the Intention of Parliament'\u000d\u000a      was very thought provoking and I think I would benefit if I were able to\u000d\u000a      discuss your ideas further. We do not see the GAAR as the only part of the\u000d\u000a      answer to tax avoidance. That is why we are looking at a range of options,\u000d\u000a      including the principles-based drafting.' [C7]\u000d\u000a    Judith Freedman's research on tax avoidance influenced debate among tax\u000d\u000a      professionals, the public, and government officials; its leading ideas\u000d\u000a      shaped anti-avoidance provisions of the Finance Act 2013. These provisions\u000d\u000a      affect tax liabilities and tax policy throughout the UK.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Judith Freedman's research on tax law and policy helped shape\u000d\u000a      anti-avoidance provisions of the Finance Act 2013. Freedman had proposed a\u000d\u000a      statutory general anti-avoidance principle combined with a\u000d\u000a      statutorily created administrative framework to limit the exercise\u000d\u000a      of discretion by revenue authorities, thus reducing manipulation whilst\u000d\u000a      achieving reasonable certainty in UK tax law. This research directly\u000d\u000a      informed debates among tax professionals, officials and the public. The\u000d\u000a      2011 Aaronson study group (of which Freedman was a member), commissioned\u000d\u000a      by the Exchequer Secretary, produced proposals embodying her approach. The\u000d\u000a      government acted on these proposals in the Finance Act 2013, introducing\u000d\u000a      into UK law an overriding statutory principle, to which other tax\u000d\u000a      legislation is subject, together with an administrative framework (the\u000d\u000a      General Anti- Abuse Rule (GAAR) Advisory Panel) in which consensus around\u000d\u000a      the concept of tax avoidance can be pursued between the taxpaying\u000d\u000a      community and revenue authorities. The new anti-avoidance approach\u000d\u000a      informed via Freedman's research is now law throughout the UK, affecting\u000d\u000a      every taxpayer.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Oxford\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Oxford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Oxford","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007774}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2643743","Name":"London"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[R1] J.

The research on\u000d\u000a      which this was based [R1] was prompted by public concern about\u000d\u000a      alleged tax avoidance and other `unacceptable' behaviour by large\u000d\u000a      corporations, and by the response of tax administrations in the UK and\u000d\u000a      elsewhere in attempting to deal with this as a matter of corporate social\u000d\u000a      responsibility, by bringing `tax law into the boardroom'. Freedman's\u000d\u000a      research drew on her experience working on previous proposals from the Tax\u000d\u000a      Law Review Committee of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and new research\u000d\u000a      conducted by her in Oxford since her appointment in 2001.\u000d\u000a    In her lecture and published articles arising from this research [R2,\u000d\u000a        R3] Freedman analysed the literature on tax avoidance and the\u000d\u000a      developing case law and also, more widely, the jurisprudence on\u000d\u000a      parliamentary intention and legislative drafting, and consideration of the\u000d\u000a      relationship between detail in legislation and certainty. Influenced by\u000d\u000a      the work of her Oxford colleagues Professors T. Endicott, J. Waldron, and\u000d\u000a      D. McBarnett and by J. and V. Braithwaite on statutory interpretation,\u000d\u000a      `principles' and forms of regulation, and by her own study of case law,\u000d\u000a      statutory drafting, and general anti-avoidance provisions in several\u000d\u000a      jurisdictions, Freedman showed that immense precision and detail are not\u000d\u000a      needed to maintain adequate certainty and to deliver the rule of law in\u000d\u000a      taxation. Building on this analysis, Freedman proposed a move towards principles-based\u000d\u000a      drafting of UK tax legislation and, in particular, towards a general\u000d\u000a        anti-avoidance principle or `GANTIP'. This idea, now of wide\u000d\u000a      currency, was introduced in her paper [R1]. It differed from\u000d\u000a      previous proposals for anti-avoidance rules in UK tax law in that it did\u000d\u000a      not involve detailed rules and was based on a general overriding\u000d\u000a      substantive legal principle, using objective factors or characteristics to\u000d\u000a      target certain types of transaction, rather than a motive-based test or a\u000d\u000a      rule of pure interpretation, such as that developed in the case law\u000d\u000a        [R4]. Her research also investigated the role of morality in the tax\u000d\u000a      avoidance debate, and considered the possible use of new approaches to\u000d\u000a      compliance as expounded by the Braithwaite model of `responsive\u000d\u000a      regulation' [R1, R3].\u000d\u000a    Freedman's research further proposed the provision of an administrative\u000d\u000a      framework by the legislature to ensure balances and checks on the exercise\u000d\u000a      of discretion by the revenue authorities and to facilitate a debate\u000d\u000a      between taxpayers and revenue authorities so that, in practice, a\u000d\u000a      reasonable degree of certainty could be achieved. Subsequent work [R5]\u000d\u000a      by Freedman explored the use of language in statutory drafting and\u000d\u000a      considered further the need to change the way tax legislation is drafted\u000d\u000a      more generally. The decisions of the Court of Justice in the EU (CJ) and\u000d\u000a      the possible emergence of a European abuse of law principle, together with\u000d\u000a      the role of the CJ in the transplantation of ideas and concepts in this\u000d\u000a      area were also considered [R6].\u000d\u000a    Freedman's research was unusual in its range, combining analysis of\u000d\u000a      developments in black letter law with consideration of concepts and ideas\u000d\u000a      arising from literature in legal theory, regulation, constitutional law,\u000d\u000a      comparative law and corporate social responsibility. Drawing on several\u000d\u000a      methods and speaking to several audiences, the research was able to make\u000d\u000a      theoretical and practical progress on critical issues.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15161","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the research results from the fact that court rulings in\u000a      Germany followed legal arguments which Dr Christian Heitsch, Lecturer in\u000a      Law, Brunel Law School had developed in two journal articles, one of which\u000a      (Rechtsnatur der Akkreditierungsentscheidungen \/ Prozessuale Fragen,\u000a      2009) was finished during the author's tenure at Brunel.\u000a    1.

In its opinion, the Administrative Court cited both\u000a      articles. It used Heitsch's 2007 article as the main authority for the\u000a      proposition that the duty to have degree programmes accredited constitutes\u000a      an interference with the constitutional right to academic freedom (Ibid.,\u000a      at [72]).\u000a    In addition, the Court used Heitsch's 2009 article as the main authority\u000a      for the proposition that decisions taken by the accreditation agencies are\u000a      public law rather than private law matters (Ibid., at[100], [120], [129]).\u000a    The Constitutional Court is expected to render its decision in 2013\u000a      (Docket no. 1 BvL 8\/10, pending, http:\/\/www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de\/organisation\/erledigungen_2013.html\u000a      , accessed 28\/08\/2013).\u000a    2. Litigation about the proper avenue of judicial recourse\u000a      Heitsch's 2009 article has also been cited in court rulings made in the\u000a      course of litigation about which avenue of judicial recourse is the proper\u000a      one for disputes relating to the accreditation of degree programmes. More\u000a      specifically, in its order of 13th November 2009, docket no. 15 E 1158\/09\u000a      [available at http:\/\/openjur.de\/u\/139909.print\u000a      (accessed 13\/06\/2012)], the Administrative Court of Appeal for the\u000a      State of North-Rhine-Westphalia (Oberverwaltungsgericht Nordrhein-\u000a      Westfalen) reversed a decision rendered by the Minden Administrative Court\u000a      (Verwaltungsgericht Minden) on 30th July 2009, docket no. 2 K 1291\/08\u000a      [available at http:\/\/openjur.de\/u\/140842.print\u000a      (accessed 13\/06\/2012).\u000a    The Administrative Court had ruled that the pending dispute about a\u000a      refusal to confer an unconditional accreditation on a degree programme was\u000a      a private law matter to be heard by the civil judiciary. Reversing this\u000a      decision, the Administrative Court of Appeal held that the dispute was a\u000a      public law matter, and was for the Administrative Judiciary to decide. In\u000a      its reasoning, the Administrative Court of Appeal cited Heitsch's 2009\u000a      article as main authority for the proposition that decisions taken by the\u000a      accreditation agencies are public rather than private law matters\u000a      (Administrative Court of Appeal for the State of North-Rhine-Westphalia,\u000a      order of 13th November 2009, at [10 - 11]).\u000a    3. Further evidence of Heitsch's standing with the German judiciary In\u000a      its order of 19th November 2008, docket no. 12 L 576\/08, para.\u000a      20 (available at  http:\/\/openjur.de\/u\/134585.html, accessed 28\/08\/2013),\u000a      Arnsberg Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht Arnsberg) rejected a\u000a      petition from a German academic institution for an interim injunction to\u000a      order the provisional accreditation of a degree programme. A German court\u000a      may only grant an interim injunction after it has made a finding that that\u000a      the pending principal action has good prospects of success. The Arnsberg\u000a      Court felt unable to make such a finding in the accreditation case,\u000a      because in the judges' view the case raised a wide range of difficult\u000a      procedural and substantive issues which could not be meaningfully\u000a      addressed in the context of a proceeding for interim relief. The Court\u000a      cited Heitsch's 2007 article to illustrate the relevant legal issues\u000a      (ibid. at [20])\u000a    4. Significance and Reach of Impact\u000a      Heitsch's 2007 article was the first thorough investigation into whether\u000a      the requirement for accreditation of degree programmes interferes with the\u000a      fundamental right to academic freedom and whether decisions taken by\u000a      accreditation agencies are public or private law matters. Similarly, his\u000a      2009 article was the first proper study of the various procedural and\u000a      substantive issues relating to judicial review of decisions relating to\u000a      the accreditation of degree programmes. True, there had been two previous\u000a      journal articles about the new accreditation system (Pautsch, [2005]\u000a      Wissenschaftsrecht 210; Lege, [2005] Juristenzeitung 698).The Pautsch\u000a      article dealt with the practicalities of the accreditation system from a\u000a      university administrator's perspective, took the assertion that\u000a      accreditation was a private law matter at face value, and only in passing\u000a      addressed the doctrinal issues. The Lege article was more of a polemic\u000a      rather than a thorough legal investigation.\u000a    Apart from the impact that Heitsch's research had on the development of\u000a      judicial doctrine, it also will almost certainly lead to significant cost\u000a      savings for academic institutions. This is because, until recently, the\u000a      accreditation agencies firmly believed that they were acting on a private\u000a      law basis and that they were entitled to review applications for\u000a      accreditation and the supporting multi-hundred- page paperwork very\u000a      intrusively. This manner of second-guessing the higher education\u000a      institutions' documentation has significantly distracted academic staff\u000a      from their core tasks of teaching and research.\u000a    As was criticized by State Courts of Auditors, the way the accreditation\u000a      agencies fulfil their task has also led to costs of several million Euros\u000a      per year just for the accreditation of degree programmes (see, e.g.,\u000a      Supreme Court of Auditors for the Free State of Bavaria, Annual Report\u000a      2012, Ch. 17, available at http:\/\/www.orh.bayern.de\/berichte\/jahresberichte\/aktuell\/jahresbericht-2012\/wirtschaftlichkeit\/723-tnr-17-akkreditierung-von-studiengaengen-guetesiegel-und-geschaeftsmodell.html,\u000a      accessed 28\/08\/2013; Court of Auditors for the State of Thuringia, Annual\u000a      Report 2008, Ch. 7, pp.114 et seq., available at\u000a      http:\/\/www.thueringen.de\/de\/rechnungshof\/veroeffentlichungen\/jahresberichte\/ , \u000a\u0009  accessed 01\/10\/2013).\u000a    The prospect of reasonably thorough Administrative Court review triggered\u000a      by Heitsch's research will rein in the accreditation agencies in the\u000a      future, and will have a direct impact on how they do their work. It will\u000a      also lead to significant financial savings for all higher education\u000a      academic institutions in Germany. The impact of such savings will be felt\u000a      by over 400 higher education institutions all over Germany, by hundreds of\u000a      thousands of German students and their families, and by the state\u000a      governments which fund higher education.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    About 8 years ago, German regional governments agreed to establish a new\u000a      system for accrediting academic degree programmes which are offered by\u000a      German higher education institutions (`Hochschulen'). There are more than\u000a      400 such institutions in Germany. This research discusses some\u000a      controversial legal issues relating to this new system. Several judicial\u000a      rulings in Germany followed the legal reasoning which the research had\u000a      developed. Thus the research has had impact on the outcome of legal\u000a      actions in Germany. One of these actions may turn out to be rather\u000a      significant, should the Constitutional Court rule that the Act\u000a      establishing the accreditation system is in breach of the Basic Law.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    BRUNEL UNIVERSITY (H0113)\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Brunel University","InstitutionName":"Brunel University","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10000961}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2955471","Name":"Arnsberg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2871039","Name":"Minden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2822542","Name":"Thuringia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2951839","Name":"Bavaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2861876","Name":"Nordrhein-Westfalen"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a&#8226; Christian Heitsch, Verfassungs- und Verwaltungsrechtliche Probleme der\u000a      Akkreditierung von Studieng&#228;ngen (Constitutional and Administrative Law\u000a      Issues in Regard of Accrediting Degree Programmes in Germany), [2007] Die\u000a      &#214;ffentliche Verwaltung, 770 et seq.

It rejects claims made by the actors involved in the\u000a      accreditation system to the effect that in particular any decisions taken\u000a      by the accreditation agencies are private law matters. Even though this\u000a      sounds like a typical lawyers' quibble about a technicality, it is an\u000a      important issue. This is because an affected academic institution could\u000a      have recourse to judicial review in the (German) Administrative rather\u000a      than the Civil Courts, should decisions taken by the agencies be\u000a      considered public law matters. This in turn has a significant bearing on\u000a      the applicable procedural and evidentiary rules, as well as on the\u000a      applicable substantive law. For instance, procedures in the Administrative\u000a      Courts are inquisitorial rather than adversarial, and Administrative Court\u000a      judges tend to have a different task and self- understanding than the\u000a      Civil Judiciary does. Therefore the Administrative Judiciary is more\u000a      likely than the Civil Judiciary to develop meaningful legal limitations on\u000a      the powers of accreditation agencies relating to the refusal of an\u000a      accreditation, and to stop agencies second-guessing the voluminous\u000a      documentation that academic institutions have to provide with a view to\u000a      obtaining an accreditation.\u000a    In addition, the research argues that the requirement for universities to\u000a      have their degree programmes accredited constitutes an interference with\u000a      the constitutional right to academic freedom (Art.5(3) of the German Basic\u000a      Law) which, however, is in principle capable of being justified by\u000a      overriding public policy imperatives relating to quality assurance for the\u000a      benefit of prospective students.\u000a    Heitsch's research relevant to this case study is embodied in two\u000a      scholarly articles published in highly-regarded German law journals, one\u000a      in 2007, and one in 2009. The research for the 2007 article was done\u000a      elsewhere, and so will not feature much in this case study, other than as\u000a      background support for the standing that Heitsch has attained in this area\u000a      of work.\u000a    Both articles have been cited widely in the German academic literature,\u000a      of which examples are: Citations of the 2007 article: Joachim\u000a      Christoph, Kirchen- und staatskirchenrechtliche Probleme der\u000a        evangelisch-theologischen Fakultaeten, (Mohr Siebeck publishers\u000a      2009) p.103, 124, 125, 127, 128; Susanne Meyer &amp; Bernd Pfeiffer\u000a      (eds.), Die gute Hochschule: Ideen, Konzepte und Perspektiven,\u000a      (edition sigma, 2010), p. 149, 150, 151, 153, 154; Georg Sandberger, Qualitaetssicherung,\u000a      in Volker Haug, Das Hochschulrecht in Baden-Wuerttemberg (Huthig\u000a      Jehle Rehm publishers, 2009), p. 275; Jessica Stueber, Akkreditierung von\u000a      Studiengaengen (Peter Lang publishers, 2009), p. 25;\u000a    Citations of the 2009 article: Arne Pautsch &amp; Anja\u000a      Dillenburger, Kompendium zum Hochschul- und Wissenschaftsrecht (de Gruyte,\u000a      2011 ), p.78; Patrick Becker, Studienreform in der Theologie, (LIT\u000a      publishers 2011), p. 168, 172; Hubert Detmer &amp; Michael Hartmer (eds.),\u000a      Hochschulrecht: Ein Handbuch fuer die Praxis (Huthig Jehle\u000a      Rehm publishers, 2010), p.530;\u000a    Citations of both articles:\u000a      Benedict Kaufmann, Akkreditierung als Mikropolitik (Springer,\u000a      2012), p.84; Alexander Merschmann, Die Rechtsnatur der Akkreditierung\u000a        von Studiengaengen, Neue Zeitschrift fuer Verwaltungsrecht &#8212; Extra\u000a      14\/2011, p.1 et seq.; Kerstin Wilhelm, Die Akkreditierung von\u000a        Studiengaengen im Hinblick auf die anstehende Entscheidung des\u000a        Bundesverfassungsgerichts, (Institut fuer Rechtspolitik an der\u000a      Universitaet Trier, 2011) p.19; Veith Mehde, Die Evaluation von\u000a        Verwaltungsleistungen, 44 Die Verwaltung (2011), p.179 et seq;\u000a      Hermann Josef Blanke, Rechtsgrundlagen des Akkreditierungswesens,\u000a      in Winfried Benz et al.

Dr Yorke also presented\u000a      a paper at the first African conference on the death penalty held in\u000a      Uganda in 2004, which was used to inform the Kenyan Parliament during\u000a      their legislative discussion on the country's Terrorism Bill.\u000a    - Changes to policy and practice at the European level.\u000a      Notable here is the application of Dr. Yorke's historical research as a\u000a      member of the drafting committee of the Guidelines on Strategy Against the\u000a      Death Penalty, which was submitted to the European Commission, the\u000a      European External Action Service (EEAS) and to Lady Ashton, High\u000a      Representative of the European Union. Dr Yorke made specific mention of\u000a      the need to streamline the delivery of information on the death penalty,\u000a      to continue to focus on the multilateral (UN) and bilateral dialogues and\u000a      for the establishing of a wider academic community on the death penalty in\u000a      the EU, and these were drafted as specific policy initiatives for the EU.\u000a      Dr Yorke's recommendations which are recorded in the extracts of his\u000a      speech in the final report of the EU- NGO Forum, were implemented as\u000a      specific policies in the EU (See EU Report in Section 5, pp. 4, 7-10,\u000a      20-22).\u000a    - Effects on the understanding and awareness of national and\u000a        international policymakers regarding their knowledge of international\u000a        issues relating to capital punishment and the death penalty.\u000a      Most pertinent here is Dr Yorke's membership of the Foreign and\u000a      Commonwealth Office, Death Penalty Expert Group (a sub group of the\u000a      Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,' Advisory Group\u000a      on Human Rights). Drawing upon his policy-centred research, Dr Yorke has\u000a      provided advice to the British government to inform their strategy for\u000a      communications to Embassies in retentionist countries. He has also\u000a      provided points of clarity on the UN and EU minimum standards on the death\u000a      penalty. In 2012, the British government made particular note of the\u000a      increase in executions in many Islamic countries. The Minister of State\u000a      wanted to clarify the information provided to British Embassies in North\u000a      Africa and the Middle East, and Dr Yorke was commissioned by the Expert\u000a      Group to provide a report entitled, \"Islam and the Death Penalty,\" for\u000a      this purpose. In June 2013, Dr Yorke was invited to address the Academic\u000a      Session of the World Congress Against the Death Penalty at the Royal\u000a      Academy of Fine Arts in Madrid. Dr Yorke's panel was chaired by Mr. Jose\u000a      Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, former Prime Minister of Spain.\u000a    - Use of Amicus Curiae Briefs (Friend of the Court) for the\u000a        protection of constitutional rights the United States.\u000a      Professor Julian Killingley has acted as counsel and joining-counsel in a\u000a      number of amicus curiae briefs which have helped protect the\u000a      rights of those facing the death penalty, and has acted for Amnesty\u000a      International, the Bar Counsel of England and Wales and the Bar Human\u000a      Rights Committee of England and Wales. Dr Yorke's research supported an amicus\u000a      brief contributing to the abolition of the sentence of life imprisonment\u000a      the juveniles who commit non-homicide criminal offences. This case\u000a      abolished the sentence of life imprisonment for juveniles who commit non-\u000a      homicide criminal offences.\u000a    - Benefits to activities, processes and understandings of legal\u000a        organisations in the United States.\u000a      This refers to the research-informed advice Dr Yorke provides to the\u000a      American Bar Association's Death Penalty Moratorium Project, which is the\u000a      federal professional body of practicing lawyers in the United States. He\u000a      has provided guidance for the project on their statements on international\u000a      law and the death penalty, and also on their initiatives for developing\u000a      programmes in Africa.\u000a    - Benefits to the performance and practice of UK lawyers applying\u000a        their skills to US cases.\u000a      Dr Yorke draws upon the policy research of the Centre in his capacity as\u000a      an instructor on the CPD course run by the NGOs Amicus and Reprieve to\u000a      train UK lawyers to represent people on death row in the United States.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes the impact of the work conducted by the Centre\u000a      for American Legal Studies (CALS) relating to capital punishment and the\u000a      death penalty.

The report also recommended that there should be no\u000a      difference in treatment between legitimate and illegitimate children of\u000a      the deceased and expressed concern (but nothing more) that such\u000a      discrimination could be contrary to the European Convention on Human\u000a      Rights. No such legislation was ever implemented.\u000a    In light of the failure of States to rectify the alleged deficiencies in\u000a      succession laws, the Trust commissioned Meryl Thomas to report on whether\u000a      the existing laws were human rights compliant. Her report was completed in\u000a      autumn 2009 and concluded that the current succession laws violated the\u000a      Convention rights in several respects.\u000a    The Trust as a result wrote to the Legislation Advisory Panel (the Panel)\u000a      presenting them with the findings from Professor Thomas' report and asked\u000a      them to confirm that the Panel would make certain that legislation was\u000a      brought forward within three months that would ensure that the Island's\u000a      obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights were complied\u000a      with. Questions were raised in States Assembly debates (Hansard, 20th\u000a      October 2009) as to the lack of proposed legislation in light of the law\u000a      being non-compliant with Convention principles.\u000a    The Panel decided to concentrate on the area of difference that\u000a        existed between legitimate and illegitimate children and a proposition\u000a        was debated in the States Assembly on 23rd March 2010 (P7\/2010) and was\u000a        approved. The Wills and Successions (Amendment)(Jersey) Law 2010, which\u000a        came into force on 29 January 2011, granted an illegitimate child the\u000a        same rights of inheritance as a legitimate child.\u000a    Douaire (dower) and Viduit&#233;\u000a    The Legislation Advisory Panel published their Draft Report on 2 March\u000a      2012. In parts 6 and 7 of this Report they discuss the `Thomas Report'.\u000a      They quoted large sections of the Report and following the recommendations\u000a      in the Thomas Report said , \"...the Panel felt bound to accept that the\u000a      discriminatory elements inherent in the workings of douaire and viduit&#233;\u000a      were in substance at odds with the egalitarian norms of the modern western\u000a      world of which Jersey... is part. The Panel therefore accepted the need\u000a      for legislative change to equalise the treatment of surviving spouses\u000a      insofar as their reserved rights of life enjoyment of property were\u000a      concerned.\"\u000a    As a result the Wills and Successions (Amendment No 2) (Jersey) Law 201-\u000a      was drafted and published on 27 February 2012. The result of this Law is\u000a      to abolish viduit&#233; and extend douaire to widowers as well as widows, so\u000a      that the property rights of both surviving spouses have been equalised.\u000a    Moreover, this right to dower has also been granted to surviving civil\u000a      partners.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Under Jersey law, the right to inherit property has historically been\u000a      affected by factors such as the legitimacy of a child and the gender of a\u000a      spouse.

The\u000a      report, entitled `Human Rights and the Law of Succession in Jersey' was\u000a      published in September 2009 (http:\/\/www.jerseycommunityrelations.org\/Campaigns\/Inheritance).\u000a    A summary of the findings are as follows:\u000a    \u000a      Very weighty reasons would have to be advanced within the State's\u000a        margin of appreciation for the dichotomy that existed in the inheritance\u000a        rights afforded to legitimate and illegitimate children. However, the\u000a        jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights does not afford\u000a        protection of inheritance rights to all illegitimate children.\u000a        Only children who have been recognised by the father in some way are so\u000a        protected.\u000a      The Legitimacy (Jersey) Law 1973, which grants the illegitimate child\u000a        rights of succession only in relation to the mother's estate, is\u000a        unjustifiably discriminatory in nature, since it prevented the child\u000a        inheriting from remoter relations in the maternal line. Furthermore,\u000a        where a father recognises the child these rights of inheritance should\u000a        extend to his relations.\u000a      The different nature of and conditions attached to dower and viduit&#233;\u000a        are rooted in the history of Normandy and Jersey. It was difficult to\u000a        determine what contemporary legitimate aim this difference achieves, and\u000a        there was no objective and reasonable justification for the differences\u000a        in the amount of an inheritance given to men and women. Where\u000a        inheritance rights are granted to widows and widowers they must be\u000a        equivalent or broadly similar, and as a result of the differences in viduit&#233;\u000a        and dower, discrimination based on sex in Jersey violated the Human\u000a        Rights (Jersey) Law 2000.\u000a    \u000a    The key researcher in the project was Meryl Thomas (Professor of Property\u000a      Law, Birmingham City University) and Sarah Cooper (Birmingham City\u000a      University) was research assistant to the project.\u000a    The report was commissioned as a result of Meryl Thomas' reputation in\u000a      this area. She was appointed as Visiting Professor of Succession to the\u000a      Institute of Law in Jersey in 2009. Her initial task was to write a guide\u000a      to the law of succession in the Island, since there was no book which\u000a      contained an account of this law. The book, entitled `Testate and\u000a      Intestate Succession', and which is an expos&#233; of the succession laws in\u000a      Jersey, was subsequently published by the Institute of Law (ISBN\u000a      978-1-908716-07-1). It is the first such book of its kind in Jersey.\u000a    In addition and apart from the change in the law, two peer-reviewed\u000a      papers have been published from the report together with a number of\u000a      papers delivered by Professor Thomas, in which she has explained the\u000a      problems and issues that have arisen in Jersey.\u000a    Since the introduction of the Civil Partnership (Jersey) Law 2012\u000a      Professor Thomas has been in discussion with the Chief Justice Minister of\u000a      Jersey in order to ensure that the succession rights of civil partners are\u000a      human rights compliant.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"16704","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Three types of impact are claimed: (1) initiating a move away from a\u000a      broad-brush risk factor approach to the explanation and prevention of\u000a      crime towards a focus on key causal factors and mechanisms; (2) being\u000a      recognized and utilized by policy makers; (3) contributing to social\u000a      science education nationally and internationally.\u000a    (1) PADS+'s most significant impact is on the terms of the debate in\u000a      crime prevention and policing. PADS+ is advancing thinking about the\u000a      development of more efficient and effective crime reduction policies by\u000a      drawing attention to the value and importance of the explanation (causes\u000a      and causal mechanisms) of crime, rather than the identification of factors\u000a      which are merely statistical correlates (e.g., markers such as gender,\u000a      race and socioeconomic status, which cannot be causes of crime).\u000a    This has been facilitated by wide dissemination. The 2007 SCoPiC\u000a      Conference co-organized by PI Wikstr&#246;m and then Chief Scientific Advisor\u000a      to the Home Office Professor Paul Wiles, and PI Wikstr&#246;m's 2012 Nigel\u000a      Walker Lecture were attended by large numbers of senior representatives of\u000a      government and criminal justice agencies (100-300). Following the\u000a      publication of Breaking Rules, PADS+ was the subject of articles\u000a      in four national daily newspapers (e.g., Sources 1, 2) and several\u000a      publications aimed at practitioner groups (e.g., Source 3). PADS+\u000a      researchers took part in interviews for BBC radio and television e.g. BBC\u000a      Radio 4, `Thinking Allowed', 15th August 2012 (source 4); BBC\u000a      World Service News, 6th July 2012 (13:45); BBC Breakfast Show,\u000a      6th July 2012 (7:30). Reviews of Breaking Rules in\u000a      influential practitioner-targeted journals describe it as `a crucial book\u000a      for police officers leading or designing crime reduction or preventative\u000a      strategies' which provides `crucial insights for policing' (Source 5), and\u000a      having `implications for penal policies' (Source 6).\u000a    The change in the terms of the debate is evidenced by the number of\u000a      invitations from local, regional, national and international practitioners\u000a      and policy-makers' wishing to hear how the findings from PADS+ can and\u000a      should change the way they work to reduce crime. PI Wikstr&#246;m has been\u000a      invited to various meetings organized by the Home Office (attended, for\u000a      example, by the Chief Scientific Advisor, Deputy Director of the Strategic\u000a      Policy Team, and Chief Economist\/Director of Social Science; e.g., June\u000a      2009, 2010), Members of Parliament and the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit\u000a      (March 2008), the Ministry of Justice (March 2008), the Cabinet Office\u000a      (September 2012), the Youth Justice Board (November 2008, April 2011), the\u000a      Ministers of State for Crime Prevention (Home Office) and for Policing and\u000a      Criminal Justice (Home Office and Ministry of Justice) (March 2013),\u000a      various police constabularies and local government offices (e.g., March,\u000a      May and October 2013), the US National Institute of Justice (April 2011),\u000a      the Swedish National Police Board (August 2011), and the Danish Crime\u000a      Prevention Council (April 2013). In 2011, Wikstr&#246;m was appointed external\u000a      expert to the Home Office Crime and Policing Group.\u000a    (2) PADS+ has been utilised in the development of policy and practice in\u000a      the following respects. First, practitioners and policy makers have\u000a      started to integrate the implications of PADS+ into their work. For\u000a      example, the Safer Peterborough Partnership writes \"[we] are really\u000a        keen to develop our policies... working with Professor Wikstr&#246;m...\u000a        enabling the Partnership to develop its approach with a strong\u000a        understanding and consideration of what causes crime and criminality\"\u000a      (source 10); and Nottinghamshire Constabulary writes \"We are keen to\u000a        consider how we take the findings and ensure our local policy decisions\u000a        pay due attention\" (source 11) and they hope to \"turn the SAT\u000a        theory and the research findings into local operational activity\"\u000a      (Source 12). Second, the Home Office (Office for Security and Counter\u000a      Terrorism) commissioned a report applying SAT to radicalisation, which has\u000a      been cited in the Government's Prevent Strategy for preventing\u000a      violent extremism (source 8) which is part of CONTEST: The United\u000a      Kingdom's Strategy for Countering Terrorism (source 7). Third, the Home\u000a      Office has commissioned a report, currently in development, detailing the\u000a      implications of PADS+ research for policy and practice, indicating their\u000a      intention for this contribution to the knowledge base to be utilised in\u000a      local and national crime prevention strategy.\u000a    (3) In addition to its impact in criminal justice and policy arenas,\u000a      PADS+ has been included as a case study in the OCR Psychology A Level\u000a      syllabus (Source 9), which is taught to an estimated 12,000 UK students\u000a      each year, and PADS+ researchers have been invited to speak at a number of\u000a      UK secondary schools. Breaking Rules (Reference 1) is already\u000a      being used in University courses in the US (Temple University), Germany\u000a      (Universities of Hamburg and Mannheim) and Sweden (Malm&#246; University) and\u000a      the fact that Reference 3 has been one of the most accessed articles in\u000a      the Journal of Quantitative Criminology since its publication suggests it\u000a      is also being used extensively in university courses.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    PADS+ casts light on the causal mechanisms for crime, highlighting how\u000a      the interaction between people and settings leads to acts of crime.

Recently (August 2013), the research\u000a      centre has been awarded an additional &#163;1,336,214 from the ESRC for a\u000a      specific study of the role of social disadvantage in crime involvement\u000a      running from 2014-2016.\u000a    Evidence of quality of the research\u000a    1. End of Award Report: The evaluation report for the SCoPiC\u000a      Network coordinated by PI Wikstrom and including the initial phase of\u000a      PADS+ (2002-2007) states `in terms of quality, the network is unique in\u000a      the scope of data collected, the methodological sophistication shown, and\u000a      the consistent theoretical conception (all compared against international\u000a      standards)'; `SCoPiC research was and is also breaking new ground in\u000a        international standards of longitudinal research'; and `on the basis\u000a      of its scientific quality, the SCoPiC network is already playing a major\u000a      part in international discourse in developmental criminology' (all\u000a      original emphasis).

Reviews of Breaking Rules: Breaking\u000a        Rules, published by Oxford University Press, received advance praise\u000a      from a number of leading criminologists (published in full in Wikstr&#246;m et\u000a      al., 2012). Professor Michael Gottfredson (President of the University of\u000a      Oregon) situates it `among the most significant works in criminology in\u000a      decades' and states that the study `sets the standard for sophisticated\u000a      and innovative measurement, for careful and well-executed research design,\u000a      and for clarity and precision of presentation...' and `provides data of\u000a      unprecedented scope and quality'. Professor Robert J. Sampson (Harvard\u000a      University) states that it is `a breakthrough that deserves a wide\u000a      readership'. Professor Stephen Messner (University of Albany) writes that\u000a      Breaking Rules `combines all the features of first-rate scholarship\u000a      in social sciences', `succeeds in pushing forward the boundaries of the\u000a      discipline by applying a promising criminological theory skilfully' and\u000a      concludes that `the book serves as an exemplar of contemporary social\u000a      science at its best.'\u000a    3. 2011 Presidential Address to the American Society of Criminology:\u000a      In this high profile session, ASC President Professor Stephen Messner\u000a      independently identified SAT as embodying the annual meeting's theme of\u000a      `innovations and bold ventures in criminology' (Messner, S. 2012.\u000a      Morality, markets, and the ASC: 2011 Presidential address to the American\u000a      Society of Criminology.

As PI, Wikstr&#246;m\u000a      has led the PADS+ research team, which includes current Research Associate\u000a      Dr. Kyle Treiber (since 2003) and Research Manager Beth Hardie (since\u000a      2004). PADS+ is an on-going longitudinal study of over 700 young people\u000a      living in Peterborough which began in 2002 when participants were 11 years\u000a      old. PADS+ has gathered a wide range of data to improve our understanding\u000a      of what makes people `crime prone' and settings `criminogenic', how people\u000a      become exposed to different settings (selection effects), and how people\u000a      and settings emerge over time (e.g., developmental and degenerative\u000a      processes).\u000a    The main project outputs across the initial research phase (2002-2008)\u000a      included the development of the analytical framework (Situational Action\u000a      Theory &#8212; SAT; References 2, 4, 5) and its application to research across\u000a      different stages of the life course. During this phase, PADS+ was a part\u000a      of the SCoPiC (Social Contexts of Pathways in Crime) Network\u000a      (www.scopic.ac.uk). Strong emphasis was placed on disseminating the\u000a      analytical framework and highlighting its advances upon existing\u000a      criminological perspectives at key international events, including four\u000a      annual SCoPiC conferences (2004-2007), the last being organized in\u000a      conjunction with the Home Office.\u000a    From 2008 to the present the main PADS+ project outputs have related to\u000a      the adolescent phase (ages 13-17), including publication of the book Breaking\u000a        Rules (Reference 1) in 2012. Breaking Rules provides the\u000a      first detailed description of the study, its research methods, and core\u000a      findings. Core findings are that (i) personal morality and the ability to\u000a      exercise self-control are key individual factors leading people to\u000a      perceive and choose crime as an option for action, with morality playing a\u000a      more fundamental role (Reference 6); (ii) the moral context (measured\u000a      using both social and physical environmental data) is the key\u000a      environmental factor which leads susceptible people to see and choose\u000a      crime as an option; and (iii) crimes happen only when crime-prone people\u000a      (those with weak morality and a poor ability to exercise self-control) are\u000a      exposed to settings with a weak moral context &#8212; something that previous\u000a      research has not be able to explicitly demonstrate.\u000a    Key insights from this are that crime prone people can be seen as situationally\u000a        vulnerable to criminogenic contexts, but do not offend in\u000a      non-criminogenic contexts, while crime averse people are situationally\u000a        resistant and do not offend even in criminogenic contexts. This is\u000a      critical for drawing attention to the fact that crime cannot be explained\u000a      by characteristics of a person or a setting alone, but only through their\u000a      interaction, and has important implications for the advancement of\u000a      criminology and crime prevention policies and practice. PADS+ is the first\u000a      study to present firm evidence of the person-environment interaction in\u000a      crime causation (References 1, 3), as a result of its innovative methods,\u000a      which are now being replicated in collaborative and independent studies\u000a      around the world.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"16706","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe research conducted at the Violence Research Centre has had impact on practical\u000d\u000ainterventions undertaken by public bodies at the local, the national, and the European level.

The municipality extended the programme and it is currently\u000d\u000aused in over 600 classes and nurseries in the city [Source 1]. Recently the Canton of Solothurn\u000d\u000ahas started the introduction of the programme in over 160 classes.\u000d\u000aNationally in Switzerland: On the basis of his expert report in 2009 [Reference 3], the Swiss\u000d\u000aGovernment adopted in June 2010, a national plan (2011-15) for evidence-based violence\u000d\u000aprevention (Source 2, citing Eisner in footnote 3 and in 5 other places). The interim report says that\u000d\u000a`the principal academic basis for this Programme is the Report Youth and Violence Prevention\u000d\u000a(Eisner 2009)': Source 3, p. 10 our translation). This plan includes support for implementing\u000d\u000ainterventions, coordination between all levels of public administration, a data-base on evidence\u000d\u000abased programmes, funding for evaluation studies, national conferences for prevention\u000d\u000apractitioners, and a practitioner support service [Source 3].

Apart from assertions by Expert Eisner, this philosophy is as yet\u000d\u000anot widely disseminated in Switzerland' [Source 3 p. 38].\u000d\u000aThe impact of the recommendations in Professor Eisner's study on child sexual abuse (Reference\u000d\u000a3) was evaluated in an internal report to the funding agency, the Optimus foundation. Impact was\u000d\u000aevaluated through 20 interviews with representatives of local and national public agencies, child\u000d\u000aprotection networks, and NGOs. Responses suggest impact at several levels: a) The general\u000d\u000apublic `booklet', which summarizes main findings in an approachable way and relates them to\u000d\u000aprevention strategies was found to be widely used by practitioners [Source 4]. b) The report was\u000d\u000afound to have been important input for policy initiatives. For example, primarily based on the\u000d\u000afindings presented in Reference 3 the Swiss Federal Office of Gender Equality developed\u000d\u000arecommendations for the cantons and municipalities about measures to reduce dating violence\u000d\u000aamongst adolescents, which have since led to a considerable number of prevention initiatives\u000d\u000a[Source 5]. c) Finally, respondents in the criminal justice system found the report an important\u000d\u000aresource for responding to political initiatives.\u000d\u000aInfluence wider in Europe: The research by Dr Ttofi on bullying prevention, partly funded by the\u000d\u000aSwedish Crime Prevention Council [Reference 5], has been disseminated through the Campbell\u000d\u000aCollaboration, the most important organization globally to make social-science research accessible\u000d\u000ato policy-makers and practitioners. It was met by considerable interest amongst the general public\u000d\u000aand by policy-makers in several countries. Findings of the study were featured in, amongst others,\u000d\u000athe Time Magazine, the Boston Globe, the Economist  and Svenska Dagbladet [Source 6], In\u000d\u000a2010, the authors of Reference 5 were invited to present their findings to Norway's Ministry of\u000d\u000aEducation and Research, which produced a policy report based on the findings [Source 7].\u000d\u000aReference 5 also was a crucial resource for the National Action Plan on Bullying of the Republic of\u000d\u000aIreland [Source 8, pp. 76-7].\u000d\u000aInfluence on European research: The studies conducted by Professor Eisner [References 1,2,3]\u000d\u000ahad impact on research at the European level. In 2010, he was commissioned by the European\u000d\u000aScience Foundation (ESF) and the Jacobs Foundation to develop a strategic workshop on\u000d\u000a`Evidence-based developmental prevention of violence and bullying: European Strategies'. The\u000d\u000aconference resulted in the ESF adopting a foresight Science Position Paper for a Science-Based\u000d\u000aEuropean Violence Prevention policy [Source 9]. The position paper, which is the considered view\u000d\u000aof the ESF social science committee, has been disseminated widely amongst European public\u000d\u000ahealth and criminal justice institutions; it includes nine recommendations for improving the\u000d\u000aeffectiveness of research supported violence-prevention.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThis impact case study shows how work by members of the Violence Research Centre (VRC,\u000d\u000adirector Professor Manuel Eisner) at the Institute of Criminology has contributed to policy change\u000d\u000arelated to violence prevention in European countries, and the implementation of new violence\u000d\u000aprevention strategies at the levels of local and national governments.

Over the past 10 years he has\u000d\u000abuilt up a specialism in rigorous empirical research that informs policy-makers and practitioners\u000d\u000aabout effective evidence-based violence prevention. In this case study we use four research\u000d\u000astudies to demonstrate impact:\u000d\u000a(1) He is principal investigator of the Zurich Project on the Social Development of Children, an on-\u000d\u000agoing longitudinal study of 1300 children from ages 7 to 15 that is designed to facilitate policy-\u000d\u000arelevant scientific research. It is combined with the implementation of two universal interventions.\u000d\u000aWhile the social skills training had a positive impact, research showed that a well-known parent\u000d\u000atraining programme did not yield the desired effects [Reference 1]. The authors concluded that\u000d\u000aexisting structures of parental education were as effective as the examined new programme and\u000d\u000amade a number of recommendations on developmental violence prevention [Reference 2].\u000d\u000a(2) Based on the wide recognition of this research on developmental prevention [Reference 2]\u000d\u000aProfessor Eisner was commissioned by the Swiss Government to develop a review of knowledge\u000d\u000aabout evidence-based prevention of youth violence, and to make national recommendations on a\u000d\u000amore effective violence prevention policy. The report was completed at the Institute of Criminology\u000d\u000ain 2008\/9. It comprised 16 recommendations, including the creation of national structures for\u000d\u000aimplementing and monitoring evidence-based violence prevention strategies [Reference 3].\u000d\u000a(3) In 2010 Prof Eisner was also commissioned to write the scientific report on the first Swiss\u000d\u000aNational survey on child sexual abuse, which is based on a sample of over 7,000 children aged 15\u000d\u000ayears [Reference 4]. It was the first nation-wide survey that produced robust epidemiological data\u000d\u000aon child sexual abuse in Switzerland. The study was conducted to guide national policy on the\u000d\u000areduction of child sexual abuse and included policy recommendations. Amongst others it\u000d\u000arecommended the development of a national plan for action by a national working group consisting\u000d\u000aof representatives of policy making, practice, and advocacy organisations.\u000d\u000a(4) The second member of the VRC in an established position is Dr Maria Ttofi (Postdoctoral fellow\u000d\u000athen Lecturer from 2009). A major part of Dr Ttofi's work focuses on the effectiveness of bullying\u000d\u000aprevention programmes.

Use of the MQPL survey by HM Prison Service, and internationally\u000a    The MQPL survey was first adopted for use by HM Prison Service Standards\u000a      Audit Unit in 2004 as one factor in its Prison Rating System. It has since\u000a      been extended by the Audit and Corporate Assurance Directorate of NOMS,\u000a      and remains in use to the present day. MQPL scores from annual surveys are\u000a      used in moderating the Performance Rating of a prison in terms of its\u000a      decency and safety, and as part of an equality score (Sources 1, 4, and\u000a      9).\u000a    Since 2007, the SQL data has been used by HM Prison Service in assessing\u000a      the performance and quality of establishments, and in understanding\u000a      attempts to improve prison culture. For example, since 2011 it has been\u000a      used to develop the `every contact matters' agenda in shaping the public\u000a      sector's bids to operate prisons as efficiently and effectively as\u000a      possible in a competitive environment (Source 4).\u000a    In May 2013, the Home Office Youth Justice Board implemented a three-year\u000a      commitment to extend the MQPL survey to young persons' establishments.\u000a      Information derived from the MPQL surveys is now used in the Board's\u000a      performance management framework (Source 4, 2). Since 2012, the National\u000a      Audit Office has been in discussion with NOMS and the PRC to develop plans\u000a      for using MQPL in evaluating NOMS policy on the closing, opening,\u000a      extending and changing the function of prisons: (Sources 4, 2).\u000a    The research has been used to make significant decisions about the\u000a      management of contracts with both public and private sector prisons,\u000a      including the decision to end the rectification notice on HMP Rye Hill in\u000a      2009 (Source 7).\u000a    The research has had international impact. Since 2010, the PRC has\u000a      trained personnel and overseen the use of MQPL in other jurisdictions,\u000a      including the Irish Prison Service, and the Norwegian Correctional\u000a      Research department, both of whom have now adopted the measure (Source 4).\u000a      Since 2012, the Centre for the Rehabilitation of Torture Victims (an NGO\u000a      in Kosovo) has used MQPL to identify ill-treatment of prisoners: (Source\u000a      8).\u000a    ii. Influence on the `decency agenda'.\u000a    The `decency agenda' emerged in 2000-2001 as a key theme in the\u000a      development of HM Prison Service's measures of prison quality. From 2004\u000a      to the present, the use of the MQPL surveys by HM Prison Service has\u000a      generated a body of qualitative and quantitative information that has\u000a      enabling the practical implementation of the `decency agenda' in prisons.\u000a      The MPQL surveys provided a language and a methodology for evaluating and\u000a      comparing the accomplishment of the general aims of `decency' and\u000a      `performance' in prisons.\u000a    The MQPL survey generated empirically valid information about the moral\u000a      practices and of prison staff, and the experiences and survival or change\u000a      trajectory of prisoners which were specific to individual prisons. Senior\u000a      managers were able to use that information as they planned policies,\u000a      introduced cultural changes, and set or supplemented performance targets\u000a      in their own institutions: (Sources 1, 4 and 6). Some specific examples\u000a      are: (i) in 2010 a HM Prison Service Deputy Director of Custody set `human\u000a      flourishing' targets for all of her Governors in the South West Area)\u000a      (Source 6); (ii) since 2011, the PRC team have been contracted to conduct\u000a      `MQPL-plus' surveys (including interviews and observation) in\u000a      `operationally important' sites undergoing significant reorganisation\u000a      (Sources 1, 4, 9).\u000a    iii. Prison suicides.\u000a    Between 2001 and 2009, MQPL and SQL survey results influenced the\u000a      development of HM Prison Service measures which were successful in\u000a      reducing prison suicides. Between 2001 and 2004 the Prison Service\u000a      commissioned Liebling and her colleagues to conduct MQPL and SQL surveys\u000a      in 12 prisons where there was a higher than expected suicide risk (Sources\u000a      1, 4). The survey results identified which aspects of prison quality\u000a      tended to reduce prisoner distress, which the research showed was highly\u000a      correlated with three-year moving average suicide rates in individual\u000a      prisons. Between 2005 and 2009, the results encouraged implementation of\u000a      the national violence prevention strategy by the Safer Custody Group at\u000a      NOMS Headquarters (Sources 1, 4). The period saw a sustained reduction in\u000a      prison suicides, from 2005, which has continued. The number of suicides in\u000a      1999, 2000 and 2001 was 81-2 (125 per 100,000). Since the completed\u000a      implementation of the Safer Custody Programme in 2009-10, the figure has\u000a      fallen to 57 and 51 respectively (66-68 per 100,000), despite increases in\u000a      the prison population: (Sources 1, 4, 5, 7).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken on prison quality and moral performance by the\u000a      Cambridge Prisons Research Centre (PRC) has been used to develop the\u000a      Measuring Quality of Prison Life (MQPL) and Staff Quality of Life (SQL)\u000a      surveys for HM Prison Service.

Liebling has been an\u000a      employee of the University since 2000, holding the position of Professor\u000a      since 2007, and Director of PRC since 2000. Helen Arnold (Research\u000a      Assistant) and Dr Ben Crewe (Director, Master of Studies Programme) have\u000a      been employees of the University and members of the PRC since 2000 and\u000a      2001 respectively. The purpose of the research has been to develop\u000a      quantitative measures of essential qualitative dimensions of prison life\u000a      in order to evaluate prisons in terms of their moral performance.\u000a    The research has two main approaches. The first involves `appreciative\u000a      inquiry', which is a methodology adapted from the literature on change in\u000a      organisations. It concentrates on the strengths of an organisation, by\u000a      articulating what is `best' and life-giving about it (e.g., how prison\u000a      officers operate at their best (Reference 4)). The research sought to\u000a      identify inductively the `key dimensions of prison life', in terms of\u000a      relationships, personal development, and order and organisation.\u000a    The second approach, arising from the first, has been the development and\u000a      administration of detailed quality of life surveys for prisoners and\u000a      staff. The surveys were originally developed in five prisons selected on\u000a      advice from the Prison Service to provide a range of `performance' and\u000a      quality. The surveys had a highly standardised format, consisting of\u000a      detailed `tick box' questionnaires.\u000a    Their main goals were authentic description of the moral, relational and\u000a      social climate in individual prisons, and explanation of their\u000a      differences. The innovative feature of the surveys was that they involved\u000a      grounded theory explorations with staff and prisoners about what mattered\u000a      most in prison (Reference 1). In the past, these important dimensions of\u000a      prison life were considered too difficult to measure quantitatively. The\u000a      methodology was `ethnography-led measurement', combining generative\u000a      dialogue with quantitative evaluation, fusing conceptual with empirical\u000a      exploration. This unique approach led to highly convincing and reliable\u000a      measurement (Reference 2). The methodology revealed considerable consensus\u000a      as to the most important dimensions of prison life and quality. These\u000a      included respect, humanity, staff-prisoner relationships, trust,\u000a      well-being, safety, order and the use of authority by staff (References 1,\u000a      2 and 3).\u000a    These methods were used to generate quantitative and qualitative data\u000a      about the moral quality of life in the five prisons, and the relationship\u000a      between quality and outcomes. This has allowed systematic comparisons to\u000a      be made between prisons (both between and within different sectors) and\u000a      over time. The results have enabled systematic evaluation of specific\u000a      policy changes affecting prisons, and evaluation of efforts to implement\u000a      improvements in prison policy, management and outcomes (e.g., Reference\u000a      6).\u000a    The development of the research since 2000 means that empirical\u000a      observations have been used by Liebling and other researchers at the PRC\u000a      and elsewhere to develop new theories and conceptual categories relevant\u000a      to prison life and experience. These have generated better observations,\u000a      and demonstrable links with important outcomes (e.g., personal\u000a      development, and suicide and disorder prevention (References 5, 6)). The\u000a      surveys have been extended to all prison institutions in England and\u000a      Wales.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17683","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282028","Name":"Maldives"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"51537","Name":"Somalia"},{"GeoNamesId":"783754","Name":"Albania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1655842","Name":"Laos"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Significance and reach: Professor McAuslan sets the\u000d\u000a      standard for land law in areas such as customary tenure, women's access to\u000d\u000a      land and resettlement.

Subsequently, he drafted a Resettlement Policy\u000d\u000a      Framework (RPF) for the MEW's submission to the World Bank for a $140m\u000d\u000a      project to repair and expand small scale water and irrigation works in\u000d\u000a      Afghanistan. This RPF was approved by World Bank and is now used to\u000d\u000a      determine compensation for locals. McAuslan has drafted further RPFs for\u000d\u000a      the Ministry of Mines (mining development project) and again for MEW\u000d\u000a      (major transnational electricity transmission project stretching from\u000d\u000a      Kyrgyzstan to Pakistan). These RPFs have been used by those Ministries to\u000d\u000a      prepare action plans to required World Bank standards (see 5.3).\u000d\u000a    Not only have these RPFs enabled the Afghan government to fulfil the\u000d\u000a      conditions for World Bank funding for those projects, but the RPFs\u000d\u000a      themselves have helped build expertise and good practice amongst\u000d\u000a      Afghanistan officials involved in land acquisition with respect to\u000d\u000a      compensation for displaced locals.\u000d\u000a    Other work in Afghanistan met with some resistance to change the status\u000d\u000a      quo. For example, McAuslan's work to review Land Acquisition Law and Land\u000d\u000a      Management Law for the Afghanistan Land Authority (AZARI) was accepted by\u000d\u000a      the World Bank, but met with local resistance. However, AZARI's continued\u000d\u000a      use of his expertise suggests that opportunities for influence persist,\u000d\u000a      and 5.2 can confirm McAuslan's recent and ongoing engagement with the\u000d\u000a      Afghan government, advising it on revisions to its Land Acquisition law.\u000d\u000a      McAuslan's contribution during the impact period laid the groundwork by\u000d\u000a      presenting model solutions and effecting debate amongst stakeholders on\u000d\u000a      actions which might be implemented at a more conducive time.\u000d\u000a    Impact on women's access to land\u000d\u000a      McAuslan's research on women's access to land (3.5) was the basis for a\u000d\u000a      key checklist in a FAO guide (5.7) on how to ensure gender-equitable legal\u000d\u000a      drafting. The FAO guide was the first in a series of technical guides on\u000d\u000a      governance of tenure, to provide advice on \"mechanisms, strategies and\u000d\u000a      actions that can be adopted to improve gender equity in the processes,\u000d\u000a      institutions and activities of land tenure governance\". McAuslan's\u000d\u000a      research was also the source of information on the disadvantages of appeal\u000d\u000a      mechanisms involving courts or tribunals (pg. 35); and of the principle\u000d\u000a      adopted by the guide that land and family law should be reformed together\u000d\u000a      (pg. 29).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Patrick McAuslan's research changed the international\u000d\u000a      development community's view about the role of land law reform in\u000d\u000a      sustainable development and poverty alleviation.

His research examined the\u000d\u000a      role that law plays (and should play) in development, concentrating on\u000d\u000a      land tenure and urban planning.\u000d\u000a    McAuslan argued that poorly functioning land markets contribute to\u000d\u000a      informal arrangements for land settlement &#8212; and such informal settlements\u000d\u000a      are not an outcome of poverty (as generally perceived by development\u000d\u000a      agencies) but a contributing factor. Lack of formal registration\u000d\u000a      of land, an inability to reliably identify specific lots, and insecure\u000d\u000a      ownership prevent occupiers from using \"their own\" property as collateral\u000d\u000a      to borrow money. Improving the security of land rights (whether by formal\u000d\u000a      or local\/informal registration) is thus an important tool for economic\u000d\u000a      development, since it serves to increase land-related investment (and\u000d\u000a      hence the efficiency of this prime factor of production), as well as\u000d\u000a      facilitating access to credit.\u000d\u000a    During 1995-1998 fieldwork in the Gambia, Swaziland and Namibia for the\u000d\u000a      UN's Food &amp; Agriculture Organisation (FAO), McAuslan analysed land\u000d\u000a      acquisition and registration. He used his findings to develop principles\u000d\u000a      for best practices which could be promoted by the FAO and used by\u000d\u000a      governments, regardless of their political persuasion or the underlying\u000d\u000a      basis of their legal systems.\u000d\u000a    McAuslan's research during this period is discussed in outputs 3.1, 3.2\u000d\u000a      and 3.3, describing the evolution of policies and laws on tenure security\u000d\u000a      in Africa, and demonstrated how the colonial legacy shaped current needs.\u000d\u000a      He studied the tension between the external donors' goals to improve land\u000d\u000a      law and create a more efficient market for land; and the country's\u000d\u000a      internal pressures for secure tenure by informal arrangements. He also\u000d\u000a      examined what inhibits governments from completely supporting reforms that\u000d\u000a      enable or help informal settlements.\u000d\u000a    In the late 1990s, McAuslan considered how realistic it was to use land\u000d\u000a      law reform as a vehicle for radical social reform, based on his experience\u000d\u000a      of drafting new land laws in Uganda and Tanzania (3.4) and his subsequent\u000d\u000a      observation of their frustrated implementation. He noted that certain\u000d\u000a      conditions &#8212; a lack of capacity or political will to implement the\u000d\u000a      legislation effectively; very slow or limited dissemination and awareness\u000d\u000a      of new rights; personal disincentives for officials in central government\u000d\u000a      to implement the new laws &#8212; impeded reform or created a situation where\u000d\u000a      only those with the resources to employ lawyers will benefit.\u000d\u000a    These insights (included in 3.1) informed McAuslan's approach to land\u000d\u000a      management reform in subsequent contexts, e.g. Afghanistan 2007 (see\u000d\u000a      section 4) where strong vested interests impeded the effective\u000d\u000a      implementation of new laws.\u000d\u000a    McAuslan also significantly contributed to the recognition of the\u000d\u000a      importance of customary land tenure and the need to accept the plurality\u000d\u000a      of legal systems in many parts of the world. His research (specifically\u000d\u000a      output 3.3) stimulated debate and pointed the way forward on these matters\u000d\u000a      for the UNDP and CGIAR (the Consultative Group on International\u000d\u000a      Agricultural Research, see section 4). His research (3.5) also discussed\u000d\u000a      how different social, religious and political circumstances pertaining in\u000d\u000a      different countries affected women's ability to access land.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17684","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"783754","Name":"Albania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Key consumers of this research have included senior figures in the police\u000d\u000a      and judiciary; policy officials and researchers in both spending\u000d\u000a      departments and the Cabinet Office; the National Audit Office; and\u000d\u000a      politicians.

The NAO commended this research\u000d\u000a      (specifically 3.1) advising that it was \"interesting from a value for\u000d\u000a      money perspective\", since increasing the legitimacy of the criminal\u000d\u000a      justice system could contribute to crime reduction.

This aimed to\u000d\u000a        stimulate policy colleagues in the MoJ to consider how people think\u000d\u000a        about trust in criminal justice, and included practical policy\u000d\u000a        suggestions as well such evidence, analysis and explanation of the\u000d\u000a        relevance of procedural justice theory. Integrating the two data sets\u000d\u000a        was informative (as 5.2 can comment) resulting in a better understanding\u000d\u000a        of how confidence in the judicial system is related to willingness to\u000d\u000a        co-operate with legal authorities. The addition of 3.1 findings also\u000d\u000a        enabled a comparison of the UK with other European countries, resulting\u000d\u000a        in the conclusion that there was \"room for improvement in UK levels of\u000d\u000a        trust and confidence in the criminal justice system\" (pg. 55).

He also\u000d\u000a        changed HMIC's awareness of how sensitively the public interpreted\u000d\u000a        everyday police behaviour &#8212; prompting HMIC's realisation that the public\u000d\u000a        employed a more sensitive radar on these issues than HMIC had previously\u000d\u000a        assumed. The ESS findings also led directly to two recommendations from\u000d\u000a        the then Chief Inspector of Constabulary &#8212;that training courses for\u000d\u000a        officers should include \"appropriate input in relation to integrity and\u000d\u000a        anti-corruption\" (pg. 62, 5.10) Without Fear or Favour); and\u000d\u000a        that a single accessible code of ethics should replace what he felt was\u000d\u000a        a fragmented set of aspirations, a recommendation that he was successful\u000d\u000a        in getting the College of Policing to adopt (see 5.1).\u000d\u000a      Practitioners in the College of Policing, the Metropolitan Police\u000d\u000a        Service and other police forces.

In 2009 ICPR (in partnership with LSE and Oxford\u000d\u000a      University amongst others) bid successfully to design a questionnaire\u000d\u000a      module within the fifth European Social Survey (ESS), to test various\u000d\u000a      hypotheses relating to `procedural justice theory'. Overall funding for\u000d\u000a      the ESS (from the EU and national research councils) includes provision\u000d\u000a      for intermittent modules designed by academics who compete for space on\u000d\u000a      the questionnaire. The ICPR developmental work and analysis were\u000d\u000a      part-funded by two EU FP7 grants. Fieldwork was undertaken in late 2010\u000d\u000a      and results were analysed by ICPR, LSE and Oxford from Autumn 2011\u000d\u000a      onwards. Hough co-designed the questionnaire module; but it is the\u000d\u000a      analysis undertaken by Hough &amp; Sato, and the impact of the new\u000d\u000a      knowledge they generated (published as 3.1 - 3.5 below) which is\u000d\u000a      considered in this case.\u000d\u000a    This research has, more than any other criminological project, shifted\u000d\u000a      police and judicial legitimacy to the centre of criminal policy\u000d\u000a      preoccupations in the UK. Previously, there was no systematic UK &#8212; or\u000d\u000a      indeed European &#8212; test of procedural justice theory, and it was unclear to\u000d\u000a      what extent US evidence was applicable across the Atlantic. This research\u000d\u000a      has both developed and extended procedural justice theory, and\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that its basic ideas are applicable across Europe.\u000d\u000a    The research systematically explored concepts of public trust in justice,\u000d\u000a      public perceptions of the legitimacy of the police and the courts, and\u000d\u000a      public compliance and co-operation with the law. Analysis of the results\u000d\u000a      led to benchmarking of countries on dimensions of trust in justice and\u000d\u000a      perceived legitimacy. These `league tables' show the UK falling into the\u000d\u000a      middle quartiles on most measures, better than most ex-Soviet Bloc states,\u000d\u000a      but worse than Nordic countries and other European neighbours.\u000d\u000a    The significance of this research lies in its exploration of the\u000d\u000a      relationships between different forms of trust, public perceptions of\u000d\u000a      legitimacy and compliance and co-operation. For example, trust in police\u000d\u000a      fairness is a better predictor of police legitimacy than trust in police\u000d\u000a      competence. This has important implications for police forces in how they\u000d\u000a      should manage their relations with those they police. The police can\u000d\u000a      easily squander their legitimacy by high-handed, unfair or disrespectful\u000d\u000a      treatment.\u000d\u000a    The research demonstrates that if justice systems treat people fairly,\u000d\u000a      legally and respectfully, they build their legitimacy, and secure\u000d\u000a      compliance and co-operation.\u000d\u000a    The key member of ICPR staff on this project was Professor Mike Hough\u000d\u000a      with contributions from Dr Mai Sato (Research Fellow).

Until 1991 it was the Lord Chancellor's policy to appoint only\u000a      married people to the judiciary, to avoid potential scandal arising from\u000a      the appointment of homosexuals. Consequently, the private lives of\u000a      barristers eligible for judicial appointment used to be vigorously vetted;\u000a      and (as shown by the results of a 2009 Law Society survey of LGB\u000a      solicitors) such practices and attitudes are still remembered by those who\u000a      have been in the legal profession for 30-40 years. Moran has both promoted\u000a      the need to incorporate sexual diversity in all aspects of the legal\u000a      profession, and stimulated changes in practices of monitoring and\u000a      publishing data on diversity.\u000a    Impact on Judicial Appointments Committee (JAC)\u000a    Moran contacted the JAC after the 2009 publication of the JAC's first Barriers\u000a        to Judicial Appointment research, suggesting he re-run the research\u000a      to survey the `missing' voices of legal practitioners who identified\u000a      themselves as LGBT about their perceptions of barriers to applying for\u000a      judicial roles. Moran published this research as 3.4, and subsequently\u000a      discussed JAC's approach to gathering diversity data with its Chairman Sir\u000a      Christopher Stephens. The impact of Moran's research was to lead JAC to:\u000a    a) Widen its definition of diversity to include sexual orientation. JAC\u000a      states that it gives diversity significant priority, but until Moran's\u000a      research had only analysed and reported on the diversity of selections for\u000a      judicial appointment by gender and ethnicity (source: JAC evidence to\u000a      select committee pg. 356, see 5.5 below).\u000a    b) Introduce sexual orientation as a category of demographic data\u000a      collected during the applications process. From autumn 2011, JAC has\u000a      monitored the sexual orientation of candidates, to facilitate the\u000a      statutory goal of ensuring diversity in the pool of eligible candidates\u000a      and promote awareness of the composition of those newly appointed to the\u000a      judiciary. JAC made this policy announcement at the launch of 3.4,\u000a      directly crediting the report with influencing JAC's decision (see 5.7\u000a      below).\u000a    c) Work more closely with LGBT groups to improve the perception of JAC\u000a      appointments process. CEO of JAC agreed to work more closely with Interlaw\u000a      to achieve its outreach goals [source: foreword to 3.4; example of\u000a      outreach event held on 21 Sept 2011 (see 5.8)]\u000a    Moran's continued involvement in JAC activities suggests he has succeeded\u000a      in permanently changing policy. In April 2013 he was invited by the Chief\u000a      Executive and Assistant Director to advise how JAC should implement new\u000a      \"tipping point\" provisions in the Crime and Courts Act 2013 that promote\u000a      the appointment of a candidate from an under represented group where\u000a      otherwise two candidates are of equal merit.\u000a    Impact on Lords Select Committee on Judicial Appointments Process\u000a    Moran submitted a copy of 3.4 and written evidence (as part of two\u000a      different respondent groups) to this select committee in 2011 (pp.\u000a      186-195; pp. 309-314, see 5.5). He recommended measures which could be\u000a      easily incorporated to have a positive impact on judicial diversity,\u000a      specifically a requirement for diverse shortlists for all judicial\u000a      appointments; and the better collection of statistical information\u000a      (including sexual orientation). Moran's evidence also emphasised that\u000a      diversity in the judiciary leads to better decision-making; and criticised\u000a      the JAC assumption that diversification of entry level positions would\u000a      eventually lead to diversity at upper levels of the judiciary, as\u000a      inadequate because of the length of time (20-30 years) that it would take\u000a      for such \"trickle up\" effects to take effect.\u000a    Certain conclusions\u000a        of the Select Committee (in its report for the House of Lords\u000a      published March 2012, see 5.6) aligned with Moran's evidence which suggest\u000a      it at least provided support for the committee's views, or may have\u000a      influenced them more strongly. Those conclusions were:\u000a    \u000a       a more diverse judiciary would not undermine the quality of judges;\u000a       judicial diversity needs to be increased to increase public trust and\u000a        confidence in the judiciary, and current measures are not sufficient;\u000a        and\u000a       there has not been sufficient commitment to removing barriers to\u000a        applications from under- represented groups. \u000a    \u000a    Impact on the judiciary\u000a    Moran utilised his membership of the Equal Justices Initiative, to\u000a      discuss 3.4 and 3.5:\u000a    \u000a       with the Chief Executive of the Supreme Court in October 2010 with\u000a        respect to the Supreme Court appointments review; and\u000a       with the Chair of the Tribunals Judicial Diversity Group in March\u000a        2011.\u000a    \u000a    Moran's research on judicial portraits, and the mention or representation\u000a      of sexual orientation has stimulated debate and led to two specific\u000a      impacts on judicial image making.\u000a    a) [text removed for publication]\u000a    b) Following a blog co-authored by Professor Moran and Professor Villez,\u000a      `YouTube justice UK style' the UK Supreme Court changed the editing\u000a      of its YouTube videos of judges delivering summaries of their judgments.\u000a      Drawing upon his research on visual culture and judicial images (3.1)\u000a      Moran's blog criticised the videos as little more than `primitive\u000a      television' that would fail to attract a public that lives in a culture\u000a      saturated with sophisticated video imagery. Ben Wilson, Head of\u000a      Communications at UKSC credited the blog as the trigger for specific\u000a      editorial changes to address that criticism, these being the use of a\u000a      wider range of shots and different camera angles which change the visual\u000a      dynamic of image (see 5.4).\u000a    Impact on the Law Society\u000a    Professor Moran provided advice and support (5.1) to the Law Society for\u000a      its 2009 survey of LGB solicitors, leading the society to develop its `Careers\u000a        Barriers Action plan', and to start collecting and publishing data\u000a      on the sexual diversity of the legal profession. Moran's research\u000a      contributed to Law Society's policy on widening diversity, with consequent\u000a      impacts on the support it offers to both member firms and individual\u000a      members. Two specific examples identified by the Law Society (see 5.1 and\u000a      5.3) are that Moran's research informed the advice it gives to firms on\u000a      how to meet their new regulatory obligations to collect and publish data\u000a      on sexual orientation; and also helped the Law Society improve the fit of\u000a      its offering to individual members in relation to the development of\u000a      diversity training. Moran has presented his research several times at the\u000a      Law Society (e.g. giving the 9th Stonewall Lecture in June 2010\u000a      to over 120 delegates) and to the Law Society's Equality and Diversity\u000a      Committee. The latter led to his invitation to join the Law Society's\u000a      strategic LGB steering group. Moran was a member 2007-2013, during which\u000a      he played a key role in recommending initiatives to support the Law\u000a      Society's delivery of its Equality and Diversity vision and strategy (see\u000a      5.1).\u000a    Moran also utilised the Law Society's magazine Solutions, as a\u000a      channel to a wider practitioner audience, by summarising his findings (of\u000a      3.5) and recommendations for reform of the judicial appointments process\u000a      in an article \"Diversity Challenge\" in October 2010 (see 5.9).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case describes Professor Moran's research on perceptions,\u000a      expectations and experiences of sexual orientation discrimination and how\u000a      they affect the lives of those who work in the justice and legal services\u000a      sector.

His work is unique,\u000a      providing the first empirical study of sexual diversity within the\u000a      judiciary; and it is significant, given research by US academic Professor\u000a      Tod Brower and studies by campaign group Stonewall that have reported that\u000a      the public's perception of the fairness of the justice system increases\u000a      when the judiciary is seen to better reflect the diversity of society.\u000a    Moran's work provides the first empirical account of how lesbians and gay\u000a      men manage their sexual difference while in judicial office and identifies\u000a      not only some of the challenges these judges might face, but also\u000a      strategies for the better incorporation of sexual difference. He published\u000a      his preliminary findings in 2006. One challenge Moran encountered was that\u000a      he was addressing something (sexual orientation) that many stakeholders\u000a      felt was not a characteristic that was or should be taken into account.\u000a      His research asked \"How do you research the operation and effects of that\u000a      which is not to be spoken about?\"\u000a    His innovative response in 2009 was to research more subtle portrayals of\u000a      the judiciary. Drawing on queer theory and art history, he undertook a\u000a      textual analysis of official judicial portraits of the Chief Justices of\u000a      the Supreme Court of New South Wales. He interviewed artists who had\u000a      experience of making judicial portraits to understand the symbolism and\u000a      the representation of the judicial image. Moran concluded these portraits\u000a      represent both the individual but also celebrate the qualities of the\u000a      relevant state institution to itself and to the public, publishing these\u000a      findings as 3.1 below and referring to the issues in 3.2.\u000a    In 2011, Moran pursued further the apparent absence in judicial settings\u000a      of references to the sexuality of members of the judiciary. He examined\u000a      records of swearing in ceremonies of judges of the Supreme Court of New\u000a      South Wales, finding that sexuality was referenced in every text.\u000a      Heterosexuality was deemed a judicial virtue, references to the\u000a      heterosexual family being both literally and metaphorically a source of\u000a      values indicative of the highest qualities of judicial office; commitment,\u000a      dedication, devotion, fidelity, love and self-sacrifice (see 3.3). The\u000a      sexuality of lesbian and gay judicial appointees was also apparent as such\u000a      a virtue, but was coded.\u000a    During the same period (2009-2010) Moran developed related research into\u000a      barriers to judicial careers by legal practitioners who identified\u000a      themselves as LGBT, a population not previously studied by judicial\u000a      appointment researchers or policy makers. This study (3.4) exposed\u000a      previously unidentified perceptions and expectations of prejudice.\u000a    Moran's key findings were that 70% of LGBT lawyers felt there was\u000a      prejudice within the judicial selection process, with a similar proportion\u000a      stating that more openly gay LGBT judges would encourage them to apply for\u000a      a judicial role. Moran made recommendations concerning the judicial\u000a      appointments process; and about awareness raising and stimulating cultural\u000a      change within judicial institutions (see section 4).\u000a    In 2011-2012 Moran undertook a major survey of career progression within\u000a      the legal sector (3.5), examining the effects of gender, ethnicity,\u000a      disability and sexual orientation on career progression, salaries and\u000a      working patterns. He found a significant lack of progress towards\u000a      inclusiveness and called for the sector to set targets for the inclusion\u000a      of women, ethnic minorities, LGBT and disabled lawyers and business\u000a      services professionals; and to deliver fair career progression for all. He\u000a      made recommendations to firms on how they should deliver their\u000a      inclusiveness initiatives, and monitor progress (see section 4).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17686","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Weait's research argues for a harm-reduction approach to the use of law,\u000a      demonstrating to\u000a      international policy-makers and others that an overly broad\u000a      criminalisation of HIV nondisclosure,\u000a      exposure and transmission has a negative impact on prevention efforts and\u000a      on the lives of PLHIV.\u000a      Weait's international policy work includes invitations to work as a\u000a      consultant for UNAIDS and\u000a      UNDP, and dates back to 2002 when the first UNAIDS policy options\u000a      paper on criminalisation of\u000a      HIV transmission and exposure cited in its bibliography Weait's Taking\u000a        the Blame (3.1), one of the\u000a      first published articles arguing for decriminalisation of reckless\u000a      transmission. Weait is one of the\u000a      very few UK legal academics continuously involved in these policy-making\u000a      fora over such a lengthy\u000a      period.\u000a    Throughout the eligible period Weait has been invited to provide expert\u000a      assistance to key\u000a      international consultations organised by UNAIDS and UNDP, e.g. the 2011\u000a        Expert meeting on the\u000a        scientific, medical, legal and human rights aspects of criminalisation\u000a        of HIV non-disclosure,\u000a        exposure and transmission (report of the meeting is at 5.4 below),\u000a      which united for the first time\u000a      leading scientists and legal scholars\/practitioners to discuss the latest\u000a      medical and scientific\u000a      developments regarding HIV and how these should impact on criminalisation\u000a      of HIV nondisclosure,\u000a      exposure and transmission. Pg. 2 of 5.4 advises that it benefited from\u000a      \"information, evidence and\u000a      analyses\" from the two background papers prepared by Weait Criminalisation\u000a        of HIV Non-\u000a        Disclosure, Exposure and Transmission: Background and Current Landscape\u000a      and Criminalisation\u000a        of HIV Non-Disclosure, Exposure and Transmission: Scientific, Medical,\u000a        Legal and Human Rights\u000a        Issues. The papers were also used in the February 2012 High Level\u000a      Policy Consultation on\u000a      Criminalisation of HIV Non-Disclosure, Exposure and Transmission. 5.1 can\u000a      confirm the\u000a      background papers and agenda prepared for the 2011 expert meeting\u000a      `benefit[ted] from the\u000a      scholarship and research of Professor Weait' and that such input was\u000a      `critical for the development\u000a      of such policy and advocacy approaches'. As a member of the Technical\u000a      Advisory Group for the\u000a      Global Commission on HIV (UNDP\/UNAIDS) Weait contributed the UNAIDS\/UNDP\u000a      Policy Brief on\u000a      Criminalisation of HIV Transmission (5.7 referring to 3.1) in 2008,\u000a      by acting as an `expert reviewer\u000a      of several drafts and provid(ing) valuable input' (5.1).\u000a    From 2011 to 2013, UNAIDS entered a more intense period of deliberation\u000a      of research, evidence-\u000a      building and policy dialogue, during which time Weait wrote the background\u000a      paper on\u000a      criminalisation (5.5) for the Commission, which reported in July 2012 (as\u000a      5.6, which acknowledges\u000a      Weait's role in the Technical Advisory Group and cites publications by\u000a      Weait). The culmination of\u000a      this period was the publication on May 28th 2013 of updated\u000a      UNAIDS guidance that both\u000a    \u000a      restated the policy position of UNAIDS and the Global Commission on\u000a        HIV and the Law (that\u000a        general laws &#8212; not HIV specific laws &#8212; should only be applied to the\u000a        extremely rare instances of\u000a        intentional transmission of HIV); and\u000a      provided recommendations to governments, policy-makers, law\u000a        enforcement officials, and civil\u000a        society (including PLHIV) to \"achieve the goal of limiting and\u000a          hopefully ending the overly broad\u000a          application of criminal law to HIV\" (pg 2 of the guidance).\u000a    \u000a    Weait's research has led to invitations to address policy-makers and\u000a      professional medical\u000a      organisations e.g. his presentations at HIV in Europe conferences,\u000a      identifying how criminal law\u000a      disincentivises the timely uptake of testing by those with heightened\u000a      infection risk and on expert\u000a      evidence in criminal trials involving allegations of HIV transmission and\u000a      exposure (3.3 &amp; 3.4).\u000a    National AIDS Trust (NAT) described Weait as the `leading UK\u000a      academic' with whom it\u000a      collaborated over eight years, contributing specific research-led legal\u000a      expertise to NAT and to the\u000a      entire UK HIV sector (5.2). NAT highlighted Weait's expertise on the use\u000a      of behavioural orders, for\u000a      those convicted of reckless HIV transmission. NAT used this expertise in\u000a      submissions to the\u000a      Sentencing Council and CPS, achieving a policy change in\u000a      2011 whereby CPS will no longer use\u000a      behavioural orders against those convicted of reckless transmission, or\u000a      only in very limited\u000a      circumstances. Further, Weait's contribution to a joint paper on HIV\u000a      forensics and use of\u000a      phylogenetic analysis (3.5) identified how certain scientific evidence can\u000a      and had been previously\u000a      misinterpreted. This let to CPS acknowledgment of the inconclusiveness of\u000a      phylogenetic analysis\u000a      and forensic difficulties in proving HIV transmission; leading to an\u000a      acquittal for HIV transmission in\u000a      England; and the development of CPS nationwide policy guidance on future\u000a      handling of such\u000a      evidence. The evidential threshold was raised for cases to reach court,\u000a      with a consequent\u000a      reduction in the number of cases prosecuted. NAT commented that the\u000a      response of the UK HIV\u000a      sector to criminalisation of HIV transmission is regarded as a model by\u000a      UNAIDS and others due to\u000a      its evidenced-based focus, training and education of HIV-sector\u000a      professionals.\u000a    IPPF used Weait's research extensively in their work on\u000a      challenging criminalisation across the\u000a      world (5.3). Weait was a key contributor to IPPF's 2010 campaign (5.10);\u000a      to Verdict on a Virus:\u000a        Public Health, Human Rights and the Criminal Law (translated into\u000a      three additional languages); he\u000a      participated in the video advocacy resource Behind Bars;\u000a      contributed to the school-based anti-\u000a      stigma campaign Positive?

Weait's research\u000a      activity in the intervening period is mentioned where necessary to provide\u000a      context. There are three\u000a      threads (legal conceptual; scientific; and social) to Weait's theoretical\u000a      and empirical research:\u000a    i. Legal Conceptual: How the responsibility of PLHIV is framed\u000a      within criminal law,\u000a      problematising assumptions about core concepts such as fault, harm,\u000a      consent and causation\u000a      as applied to cases involving the transmission of HIV, and addressing HIV\u000a      as an issue for the\u000a      communities of PLHIV and for public health, rather than as a legal problem\u000a      for which punitive\u000a      legal responses can provide an effective solution. Weait's research in\u000a      this area was informed\u000a      by doctrinal and theoretical research that challenged conceptual\u000a      frameworks, which is\u000a      characteristic of Law School research at Birkbeck, and by the work that he\u000a      undertook for\u000a      HIV\/AIDS organisations and for HIV clinicians at the local, regional,\u000a      national and international\u000a      level (3.1 &amp; 3.4).\u000a    ii. Scientific: Interdisciplinary collaboration with leading\u000a      European virologists into the problems\u000a      associated with the use of phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis is\u000a      the study of the\u000a      genetic relatedness between HIV strains, and is used in evidence at\u000a      criminal prosecutions for\u000a      transmission of HIV. Weait's research (3.5) explored the\u000a      inter-relationship between complex\u000a      scientific processes with the rules of criminal evidence; and describes\u000a      the limitations of the\u000a      inferences that could be made by expert witnesses (specifically that\u000a      phylogenetic analysis\u000a      alone cannot establish to the criminal standard the route, timing or\u000a      source of HIV infection).\u000a    iii. Social: The gathering and analysis of qualitative and\u000a      quantitative data to explore (in\u000a      collaboration with sociologists, psychologists and activists) the impact\u000a      of criminalisation of HIV\u000a      exposure and transmission on sexual behaviour and clinical practice, in\u000a      order to understand\u000a      the causes and adverse impact of criminalisation on health and\u000a      relationships between patients\u000a      and clinicians (3.2) and on late clinical presentation by those living\u000a      with HIV (3.3).\u000a    During the 1990s at Birkbeck, and informing his work as a volunteer\u000a      member of the Terrence\u000a      Higgins Trust legal services group, Weait developed his research\u000a      methodology into problematising\u000a      assumptions about core concepts relating to offences against the person.\u000a      These findings informed\u000a      his contribution to the Trust's submissions to the 1998 Home Office review\u000a      of non-fatal offences\u000a      against the person. This initial research was completed and published as Taking\u000a        the Blame (3.1)\u000a      between leaving Birkbeck (1999) and joining the Open University (2000).\u000a    A series of ESRC-funded seminars in 2004-5 (whilst employed at Keele\u000a      University) explored and\u000a      demonstrated the impact of criminal law's doctrinal approach to harm and\u000a      consent on PLHIV.\u000a      The culmination of Weait's research, however, was published in 2007 after\u000a      re-joining Birkbeck as\u000a      the monograph Intimacy and Responsibility: The Criminalization of HIV\u000a        Transmission (3.4) in which\u000a      Weait demonstrates that criminalising HIV nondisclosure, exposure and\u000a      transmission has\u000a      unintended and negative consequences on prevention initiatives and creates\u000a      barriers to testing\u000a      and treatment of PLHIV. Weait continues to develop this area of research,\u000a      collaborating and\u000a      publishing with medical professionals and scientists concerned with the\u000a      impact of criminalisation\u000a      both on health outcomes and primary research into prevention; and\u000a      participating in high-level\u000a      international consultations and conferences.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17841","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Lastra's work has global reach and significance: it has informed\u000a      financial legislative reforms, policy debates and deliberations amongst\u000a      legal practitioners in the United Kingdom and further afield.\u000a    National impact\u000a      Lastra has influenced UK government policy in response to the financial\u000a      crisis. In 2009 the European Union Committee (Subcommittee A) of the House\u000a      of Lords conducted an inquiry into the future of EU financial regulation\u000a      and supervision and appointed Lastra as Specialist Adviser. Lastra wrote\u000a      many of the questions put by the Committee to expert witnesses and\u000a      contributed to the writing of the final report. The Committee chair\u000a      specially thanked her contribution: \"My thanks and those of the committee\u000a      are due to our special adviser, Professor Rosa Lastra, without whom I do\u000a      not think we would have found our way through the complications of the\u000a      subject...\" (see [2] in section 5 below).\u000a    In 2011 Lastra was invited to give oral evidence to the Treasury\u000a      Committee of the House of Commons on the accountability of the Bank of\u000a      England. The Committee's report, published in November 2011, acknowledges\u000a      her input.\u000a    In 2012, she was asked to give written and oral evidence to the House of\u000a      Lords European Union Committee, Subcommittee A, with regard its inquiry\u000a      into the Banking Union proposals. She was also asked to give written and\u000a      oral evidence to the joint Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards,\u000a      appointed by both Houses of Parliament to report on professional standards\u000a      and culture of the UK banking sector, and their implications for\u000a      regulation and for Government policy and to make recommendations for\u000a      legislative and other action. The report of the Parliamentary Commission\u000a      on Banking Standards and the report of the House of Lords European Union\u000a      Committee, both acknowledging Lastra's input, were published in December\u000a      2012.\u000a    International impact\u000a      Lastra has also contributed to the design of international financial soft\u000a      law. In 2009-10 she acted as Technical Assistance Advisor to the IMF to\u000a      perform research and writing for a Board paper dealing with legal and\u000a      policy issues associated with cross-border bank insolvency following the\u000a      G20 mandate to the IMF in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.\u000a      This drew upon her published research (2003, 2007, 2008, 2009). The Board\u000a      approved the paper with a proposed framework for enhanced cooperation in\u000a      this area in July 2010. Her work is recognized in the first footnote of\u000a      the paper (see [5] in section 3 below) and in a letter (see [3] in section\u000a      5 below) acknowledging Lastra's \"important contribution to the IMF's work\u000a      on cross border banking resolution\", which \"has played a large role in\u000a      shaping the set of recommendations that have been adopted by the FSB\" (www.financialstabilityboard.org\/publications\/r_111104cc.pdf).\u000a    European impact\u000a      Lastra's work has helped shape the development of EU law. In 2011, Lastra\u000a      provided legal consultancy services to the European Central Bank at the\u000a      request of the ECB General Counsel on issues pertaining to the eurozone\u000a      crisis. She was invited to contribute on the basis of her published\u000a      research (2006). Lastra has argued (1996, 2003, 2006 and 2012) that the\u000a      ECB should adopt a supervisory role, which has become a cornerstone of the\u000a      Banking Union.\u000a    In April 2012, Lastra was invited &#8212; on the basis of her 2011 book and\u000a      earlier publications &#8212; to provide an expert legal view to the European\u000a      Commission (DG Markt) as part of the Commission's proposals for a European\u000a      framework to resolve cross border banking crises. Lastra took part in a\u000a      workshop of experts in banking and insolvency law on 19 April 2012 in\u000a      Brussels. The consultation process culminated in the publication of a\u000a      Draft Directive on Recovery and Resolution on 6 June 2012. The Head of\u000a      Financial Stability Unit at DGMarkt acknowledged Lastra's contribution in\u000a      a letter dated 19 June 2012 thanking her for her \"very valuable and\u000a      pertinent contributions\" to the process [See [1] in Section 5 below].\u000a    Informing judicial decisions in high-profile international cases\u000a      Lastra's Central Banking and Banking Regulation was referred to in\u000a      a brief of the United States of America, (p.14, amicus curiae in Case No\u000a      10-1487-cv(L) US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit NML Capital Ltd\u000a        v Banco Central de la Republica Argentina [5 July 2011]).

In the aftermath of the\u000a      financial crisis such a framework &#8212; including an end to the pervasive\u000a      `too-big-to-fail' policies &#8212; is essential for the welfare of society.\u000a    As a result of her work, laws and policies relating to the scope and\u000a      functions of central banks, financial regulatory reforms and the\u000a      resolution and insolvency of financial institutions, have changed or are\u000a      in the process of changing at the national level, at the European level\u000a      and at the international level (mostly by way of soft law standards).\u000a      Though the transition from soft law to hard law can be a lengthy process,\u000a      Lastra's call for an adequate regime on cross border resolution and\u000a      insolvency has been followed by the European Commission in the Draft\u000a      Directive on Recovery and Resolution published in June 2012.\u000a    Her research in international economic law, where she has joined efforts\u000a      with Professor Thomas Cottier of the World Trade Institute (Bern) and\u000a      Professor John Jackson of Georgetown University (widely regarded as one of\u000a      the fathers of international trade law) since 2010 [culminating in the\u000a      co-edited book International Law in Financial Regulation and Monetary\u000a        Affairs, listed in REF 2014 submission], contends that the\u000a      conspicuous absence of formal international law concerning money and\u000a      finance &#8212; in stark contrast with trade regulation under WTO law &#8212; was a\u000a      significant contributing factor to the global financial crisis that\u000a      commenced in 2007. One distinguishing feature of her work at Queen Mary\u000a      lies in the fact that she has built bridges between law and economics,\u000a      trade and finance, financial regulation and resolution, EU law and\u000a      monetary law, and between banking crises and sovereign debt crises.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17842","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    We can demonstrate impact in: advising parliamentary and executive policy\u000a      makers in diversity initiatives and legislative provisions; influencing\u000a      the work of the statutory advisory body of England and Wales on judicial\u000a      appointments; providing input to the development of new processes for\u000a      selecting judges at international level and informing the wider debate on\u000a      equality.\u000a    In 2009 Malleson and Barmes established the Equal Justices Initiative\u000a      (see www.law.qmul.ac.uk\/eji).\u000a      The EJI `brings together academics, practitioners, judges and\u000a      policy-makers to work towards gender parity on the bench'. Its work has\u000a      influenced policy development in the UK, ensuring that sound evidence,\u000a      ideas and argument are communicated to a broad range of policy makers in\u000a      this area. The ultimate beneficiaries are, however, the citizenry as a\u000a      whole, as more informed decision-making should lead to the UK having a\u000a      more legitimate and effective judiciary that draws on the talents of the\u000a      whole population. Around 100 people have signed up to the EJI as\u000a      supporters. Building on research by members of its Executive Committee,\u000a      including that of Malleson and Barmes described above, the EJI prepared a\u000a      submission to the House of Lords Constitution Committee Inquiry on\u000a      Judicial Appointments in 2011\/2012. The Committee report referred\u000a      extensively to that submission, as well as to Malleson's individual\u000a      evidence. It proposed changes designed to increase diversity in judicial\u000a      appointments including a number argued for in the EJI submission, such as\u000a      applying the \"tipping provision\" in the Equality Act 2010, extending the\u000a      remit of the Judicial Appointments Commission ('JAC') to Deputy High Court\u000a      Judges and removing the President from Supreme Court Appointments\u000a      Commissions when selecting a successor. All three are in the Crime and\u000a      Courts Act 2013.\u000a    Advising Policy Makers on Diversity Initiatives\u000a    Malleson's work on merit and specifically her 2009 proposals about\u000a      positive action were drawn on by the Advisory Panel on Judicial Diversity\u000a      set up by the Ministry of Justice (`MoJ'). The Panel's 2010 report\u000a      commented on the need to use the professions to encourage people into the\u000a      judiciary, particularly those from under-represented groups, and advocated\u000a      Malleson's proposal for `taps on the under-represented shoulder'.\u000a      Malleson, Barmes and other members of the EJI met with key policy makers\u000a      about developing diversity initiatives. For example, in March 2010 they\u000a      met the new chair of the JAC; in October 2010 they met with senior\u000a      officials from the MoJ with responsibility for taking forward the report\u000a      of the Advisory Panel; in May 2011 they met five of the six most senior\u000a      female judges in England and Wales. Malleson and Barmes have since had\u000a      ongoing informal e- mail and other contact with individuals in public life\u000a      working on judicial diversity in different ways. Members of the judiciary\u000a      (including the Head of the Judicial College) and governmental bodies\u000a      (including, indirectly the Irish MoJ) have requested copies of Malleson\u000a      and Barmes' work.\u000a    Direct Impact on new guidelines for the appointment of judges\u000a    Malleson's research on international court appointments has also had a\u000a      direct impact on reforms to the process by which judges are appointed to\u000a      the CJEU. In 2009 Malleson and Philippe Sands, Professor of International\u000a      Law at UCL, were invited to meet with Lord Mance at the Supreme Court to\u000a      share the findings of their research, given Lord Mance's appointment to\u000a      the advisory panel on the selection of CJEU judges under the Lisbon\u000a      Treaty. Their input fed into the rules and guidelines for the operation of\u000a      the panel which Lord Mance helped to draft. In April 2011 Malleson was\u000a      contacted by the Legal Adviser to the CICC, requesting copies of her 2010\u000a      book for each of the members of the CICC's informal advisory panel on\u000a      appointments to the ICC. The request said: `We have followed your work\u000a      closely over the past few years and we are sure that the Panel will\u000a      benefit from your research and insights.' The ICC has now established its\u000a      own advisory committee on nominations, a development which was in part\u000a      influenced by this research.\u000a    Informing the wider equality debate\u000a    Barmes and Malleson's work has also informed wider equality debate and\u000a      action. From 2010 to 2012 they ran (with Queen Mary colleagues from\u000a      Business and Geography) the AHRC-funded research network, PEDEC (see www.geog.qmul.ac.uk\/pedec).\u000a      This has a website, email list and held four workshops with participation\u000a      from a notably wide range of non-academic organizations (including the\u000a      Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Runnymede Trust and the\u000a      Disability Alliance). Over 200 people signed up to the network, around 120\u000a      attended the workshops and to 19 March 2013 the website had generated\u000a      24,683 page views. The network brought together individuals and groups\u000a      from different regions within the UK and internationally. In 2011\/2012\u000a      Barmes and Malleson were several times consulted by the Government\u000a      Equalities Office and Business Innovation and Skills on the design (and\u000a      peer review) of government research on equality and to connect\u000a      policy-makers to relevant research and researchers. The legacy of PEDEC\u000a      has been assured by the work of the Equality and Diversity Forum Research\u000a      Network (`EDFRN'), of which Barmes is a steering group member and in 2012\u000a      became co-chair. Barmes' 2010 research informed the Joint Committee on\u000a      Human Rights' analysis of the positive action provisions in the Equality\u000a      Bill (see HL Paper 169 HC 736, paras 286-290). The December 2009 version\u000a      of the Equality Bill was amended before enactment to insert a\u000a      proportionality requirement into sub- section 159(4). This reduced some of\u000a      the risk of UK law on positive action, and organizational measures based\u000a      on this, being de-railed by EU law challenges.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Malleson and Barmes' research at QMUL on how to promote equality and\u000a      diversity has influenced policy and legislation through its impact on a\u000a      number of official bodies, including the Advisory Panel on Judicial\u000a      Diversity in 2009\/10, the House of Lords Constitution Committee Inquiry on\u000a      Judicial Appointments in 2011\/12, the Joint Committee on Human Rights\u000a      report on the Equality Bill in 2009, the Advisory Panel for the selection\u000a      of judges to the Court of Justice of the European Union (`CJEU') in 2010\u000a      and also of the Coalition for the International Criminal Court (`CICC') in\u000a      2011.

From 2007 to 2010 she undertook research on 'positive action' -\u000a      activity designed to improve the position of a social groups that have\u000a      suffered systematic disadvantage. She combined exposition of the\u000a      conceptual underpinning of UK and EU equality law with inter-disciplinary\u000a      evaluation, leading to the following theoretically and empirically\u000a      grounded arguments: first, that UK equality law should be liberalised to\u000a      allow organisations more scope for conduct deliberately calculated to\u000a      benefit social groups whose members have been systematically\u000a      disadvantaged; secondly, that a model should be followed whereby law\u000a      guides and informs organisational experimentation with positive action;\u000a      and thirdly, that the positive action provisions in the Equality Bill were\u000a      significantly flawed, including for not respecting the limits of relevant\u000a      EU law. Barmes' model envisages the law performing three functions:\u000a      delineating the space within which organisations are free to experiment\u000a      with positive action; steering organisations that take such measures,\u000a      procedurally and substantively; and capturing what is learned in different\u000a      organisational settings for use by others.\u000a    Malleson is Professor of Law and has held this post since 2005.\u000a      From 2006 to 2009 she undertook research into whether there is a case for\u000a      positive action in judicial appointment and, if so, what form this should\u000a      take. This built on highly influential earlier research demonstrating that\u000a      the idea of `merit' is constructed rather than fixed, and that traditional\u000a      definitions need to be rethought so that a wider range of qualities and\u000a      experiences are valued. Malleson's positive action research built on this,\u000a      for example to develop the argument that lawyers from groups whose members\u000a      are under-represented on the bench should be encouraged to apply through a\u000a      system of `taps on the under-represented shoulder'. From 2009 to 2011\u000a      Malleson jointly led an AHRC funded Queen Mary\/UCL team doing extensive\u000a      empirical work on processes (nationally and internationally) for the\u000a      nomination, election and appointment of international court judges. The\u000a      findings illuminated the politicised nature of current processes. Malleson\u000a      and her collaborators consequently generated proposals to enhance the\u000a      transparency and legitimacy of the international judicial selection\u000a      process, including recommending a new advisory panel for appointments to\u000a      the International Criminal Court.\u000a    From 2008 to 2009 Barmes and Malleson undertook joint research into the\u000a      impact of the legal profession on attempts to increase diversity in the\u000a      judiciary. Inter-disciplinary analysis of the profession, reform\u000a      initiatives and background equality law demonstrated, first, that the\u000a      profession is carrying out its `gate-keeping' role in ways that hamper the\u000a      construction of a more diverse judiciary and, secondly, that diversity\u000a      initiatives to date have suffered from two repeated design flaws, `soft\u000a      target radicalism' (meaning that where radical initiatives are taken, they\u000a      tend to be aimed at the targets which are easiest to reach) and\u000a      `regulatory bind' (meaning that the existing regulatory framework\u000a      restricts the possibility to promote a wider equality agenda). It follows\u000a      that equality law which directly regulates legal practice needs to be\u000a      strengthened and the regulatory binds on the Judicial Appointments\u000a      Commission and other relevant public entities to be loosened.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17843","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Mulheron's work has had direct impacts on the ongoing process of\u000a      reforming civil procedure in England in a number of areas, in ways which\u000a      will make civil litigation cheaper and more accessible for individual\u000a      consumers and small-to-medium size businesses seeking redress from large\u000a      corporations. In an era of high legal costs, the significance of her work\u000a      is considerable. The introduction of class actions and contingency fees,\u000a      and the appropriate regulation of third party funding, will make a big\u000a      financial difference to individual consumers and small businesses.\u000a      Mulheron's work has also had a very wide reach; her work has influenced\u000a      both judges and law reform bodies in a number of other jurisdictions\u000a      worldwide.\u000a    Shaping policy on class actions\u000a    Mulheron has argued for a comprehensive, generic opt-out system to be\u000a      developed for England and Wales where there is currently no generic class\u000a      action regime. Her published work, described above, has engaged directly\u000a      in the debates over how to reform civil procedure, and has set the agenda\u000a      for policy making in governmental circles. Influenced by her research and\u000a      reports, the last government undertook to introduce a limited `opt-out'\u000a      system, which only failed thanks to sudden calling of a general election.\u000a      At present, the coalition government is continuing to explore the options\u000a      for reform.\u000a    As a result of her research, Mulheron was commissioned by the Civil\u000a      Justice Council of England and Wales (CJC) to produce a report giving\u000a      evidence of the need for a new class action regime. Her Reform of\u000a        Collective Redress in England and Wales: a Perspective of Need (Feb\u000a      2008) informed the CJC's influential report Improving Access to\u000a        Justice Through Collective Actions: Developing a More Efficient and\u000a        Effective Procedure for Collective Actions: Final Report (November\u000a      2008). Mulheron was a contributing author of the report. As the Ministry\u000a      of Justice (MOJ) noted in its response dated July 2009, the `main evidence\u000a      of a need for reform in the report is extracted from a paper written by\u000a      Rachael Mulheron'.\u000a    Although the MOJ rejected the overall recommendation of the CJC (which\u000a      had adopted Mulheron's proposals for a generic opt-out system), it\u000a      accepted the need for a sectional opt-out system, as and where a\u000a      specific need was proven. This was highly significant, since it was the\u000a      first occasion on which there has been a clear political commitment to\u000a      enacting an opt-out class action: previous efforts at reform had favoured\u000a      the opt-in approach, rather than the opt-out approach advocate by\u000a      Mulheron. This consultation process was followed by the drafting of the\u000a      Financial Services Bill 2010, cl. 18-25, which contained a collective\u000a      actions regime for financial services claims in which actions could\u000a      proceed either on an opt-in or an opt-out basis. In October 2009 &#8212; March\u000a      2010, Mulheron was a member of the rules-drafting committee, to draft\u000a      court rules underpinning the newly-proposed opt-out regime. The Bill\u000a      proceeded through the House of Commons and through two readings in the\u000a      Lords, but the 2010 general election put a stop to further progress.\u000a      However, reform in this area of civil procedure is continuing, and\u000a      Mulheron is at the heart of the process. The rules she helped draft &#8212;\u000a      which are suitable for any sectoral opt-out system &#8212; have been completed,\u000a      tabled before the Civil Procedure Rules Committee, and will be introduced,\u000a      once a legislative regime containing an opt-out class action is enacted.\u000a      Mulheron also exerts an influence on policy making through membership of\u000a      the CJC, (appointed May 2009 for three years, re-appointed May 2012 for\u000a      another three years).\u000a    As a result of her comparative analysis of class actions in overseas\u000a      jurisdictions, Mulheron was commissioned by the Department of Business,\u000a      Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) in 2008 to write a report on Competition\u000a        Law Cases under the Opt-out regimes of Australia, Canada and Portugal.\u000a      The report was described by the Chief executive of the Civil Justice\u000a      Council as an `amazing piece of work'. In September 2011, she was\u000a      contacted by BERR's successor Department, the Department of Business,\u000a      Innovation and Skills to discuss how to take forward the reforms discussed\u000a      in her 2008 paper. She met with BIS policy officials on numerous occasions\u000a      during the drafting of a consultation paper, Private Actions in\u000a        Competition Law: A Consultation on Options for Reform. Her work was\u000a      repeatedly cited in the paper, and in the accompanying Impact Assessment.\u000a      In anticipation that the proposals will become law, she was asked to lead\u000a      a seminar at the Competition Appeal Tribunal designed to inform judges of\u000a      the key certification criteria in competition law opt-out class actions.\u000a      Her formal response to the Consultation has been referred by BIS to\u000a      Parliamentary Counsel, and BIS has commissioned further memos of advice\u000a      for assistance with drafting of the relevant legislation.\u000a    The reach of Mulheron's work on the evolving law of class actions is not\u000a      limited to England and Wales, but has influenced judges and official law\u000a      reform bodies in Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong,\u000a      Ireland and Belgium. She advised the Hong Kong Law Commission, and her\u000a      work has been cited both in its consultation paper on Class Actions\u000a      (November 2009) and in its final report (May 2012). Her work has also been\u000a      cited by the Victorian Law Reform Commission (Civil Justice Review,\u000a      2008) and the New Zealand Rules Committee's October 2008 paper, Class\u000a        Actions for New Zealand (Second Consultation Paper). Her work on\u000a      class actions has also been cited by judges in a number of jurisdictions\u000a      (see section 5 for citations). Mulheron has also acted as an expert\u000a      witness in the Worldwide Air Cargo Cartel Class Action litigation\u000a      in Toronto (on the issue whether an Ontario court can bind a foreign class\u000a      member who has not opted out of the Ontario class action). Counsel's\u000a      questions during her three-hour cross-examination focused primarily on her\u000a      publications.\u000a    Shaping policy on costs regimes and the funding of litigation\u000a    Mulheron's work on class actions reform in England has also focused on\u000a      the costs regime that ought to apply to class actions litigation, and how\u000a      such litigation could, and should, be funded, were an opt-out action to be\u000a      introduced. Her work in this area has been cited by Sir Rupert Jackson in\u000a      the interim and final report of his Review of Civil Litigation Costs\u000a      (2009-10). She was commissioned by the EU-funded European Consumers' Assn,\u000a      BEUC, to produce a report, Costs and Funding of Collective Actions:\u000a        Realities and Possibilities (February 2011), to assist with that\u000a      organisation's lobbying of the European Parliament in taking forward the\u000a      2011 consultation, `Towards a more coherent European approach to\u000a      collective redress'.\u000a    Mulheron's 2008 article `Third Party Funding of Litigation: A Changing\u000a      Landscape' has also had a measurable impact on policy. In July 2011, she\u000a      was appointed to the CJC's working group on litigation funding. It\u000a      developed a Code for Litigation Funding whose recommendation for\u000a      `soft regulation' was based, in part, on her published work. Her defence\u000a      of that Code, at the Westminster Third Party Forum in November 2012,\u000a      attracted media interest (eg, `CJC Member Rules out Mandatory Litigation\u000a      Funding Code' (Law Society Gazette, 29\/11\/12); `Pressure Groups and\u000a      Litigation Funders Clash over State Regulation' (Solicitors' Journal,\u000a      29\/11\/12). In September 2013, Professor Mulheron was nominated as the CJC\u000a      'peer reviewer' to discuss and review a series of proposed amendments to\u000a      the Code for Litigation Funding.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Rachael Mulheron's research at QMUL develops an optimal model\u000a      for a system of class actions, and a model of `soft regulation' for third\u000a      party funding.

In a number of works\u000a      published since she joined Queen Mary in 2004, she has analysed the\u000a      attempts made by common law jurisdictions to develop a useful class action\u000a      regime and demonstrated what an `optimal' class action regime would look\u000a      like. Her aim has been particularly to help the United Kingdom &#8212; which has\u000a      a relatively undeveloped system of class actions &#8212; to reform its law. In\u000a      her 2004 book, The Class Action in Common Law Legal Systems, she\u000a      critiques the English procedure relating to multi-party proceedings, which\u000a      rejects an `opt-out' class action procedure (under which a class of\u000a      persons can be described as represented by a named claimant at the outset\u000a      of litigation) in favour of a more modest combination of traditional\u000a      representative proceedings and an `opt-in' group litigation order (which\u000a      requires all those represented to take a positive step to be included). In\u000a      this work, and her subsequent books and articles, she has set out a case\u000a      for a `best practice' opt-out class action for England and Wales.\u000a      Subsequent work includes her books, The Modern Cy-Pres Doctrine:\u000a        Applications and Implications (2006) (regarding how to deal with\u000a      unclaimed damages in class actions), Medical Negligence: Non-Patient\u000a        and Third Party Claims (2010) (reflecting that such claims have\u000a      often given rise to class actions elsewhere), and a number of her articles\u000a      in leading peer-reviewed journals (listed below). These works are\u000a      recognised as leading their field. Mulheron has also written influential\u000a      work on the topic of `soft regulation' for third party funding in England\u000a      and Wales. In 2008, she co-authored (as lead author) an article (`Third\u000a      Party Funding of Litigation: A Changing Landscape') which undertook a\u000a      comparative analysis of third party funding in Commonwealth jurisdictions,\u000a      and which advocated a checklist of factors which should govern 'soft\u000a      regulation' of the industry. Her works published before 2008 were\u000a      submitted for Queen Mary's RAE 2008 submission; and her major works\u000a      published since form part of the 2014 REF submission.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18046","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    There are two key areas of impact: (1) providing specialist expertise to\u000d\u000a      policy makers and legislators in the UK, Europe, China and the United\u000d\u000a      Nations to help them inform their thinking and decisions; and (2)\u000d\u000a      influencing the actual wording of ODR legislation at EU and UK level.\u000d\u000a    In 2011, Prof H&#246;rnle provided advice, based on her extensive research, to\u000d\u000a      the European Commission, in conjunction with Pablo Cortes from the\u000d\u000a      University of Leicester. This enabled the Commission to develop common\u000d\u000a      criteria for ODR. Prof H&#246;rnle was subsequently involved in drafting the\u000d\u000a      relevant proposals for EU legislation (the Directive and Regulation), at\u000d\u000a      the stage of the European Commission Proposals in 2011. The Proposals have\u000d\u000a      now been passed as the Directive 2013\/11\/EU on ADR for Consumer Disputes\u000d\u000a      and Regulation EU\/524\/2013 on Consumer ODR. Prof H&#246;rnle's research has had\u000d\u000a      a significant impact on this legislation in several specific areas. For\u000d\u000a      example, H&#246;rnle's idea, articulated in her 2013 research, that the ODR\u000d\u000a      platform is not just an information tool, but should include various\u000d\u000a      functions enabled by IT (such as the facility to transfer a dispute\u000d\u000a      directly from the consumer to the ADR provider in another member state) is\u000d\u000a      reflected in Article 5 of the Regulation. H&#246;rnle also suggested to the\u000d\u000a      Commission, based on findings in her research, that a way of imposing\u000d\u000a      pressure on traders to use ODR is to ensure that they have to inform\u000d\u000a      consumers at the outset of the transaction, before a dispute arises,\u000d\u000a      whether or not they engage with ODR; this is reflected in Article 14 of\u000d\u000a      the Regulation and Article 13 of the Directive. Prof H&#246;rnle also had\u000d\u000a      substantive input in the Commission's deliberation on the scope of the ADR\u000d\u000a      Directive. As a result, ideas from her research can be seen in Article 2\u000d\u000a      of the Directive.\u000d\u000a    Articles 7 of the Directive (relating to transparency) and Article 9\u000d\u000a      (fairness) also show the significant influence from H&#246;rnle's 2009\u000d\u000a      research, in particular the ways which due process and fairness can be\u000d\u000a      implemented in a wide-range of cross-border disputes. Article 17 of the\u000d\u000a      Directive reflects H&#246;rnle's thinking of the need for co-operation between\u000d\u000a      law enforcement and ADR, as many consumer disputes related to fraud and\u000d\u000a      scammers.\u000d\u000a    The Draft Proposals were originally issued by the European Commission in\u000d\u000a      November 2011 and have been adopted by the EU in May 2013. They are\u000d\u000a      expected to be implemented into UK law thereafter under the lead of the\u000d\u000a      Department of Business, Innovation and Skills. Prof H04e7rnle has been\u000d\u000a      invited to the stakeholder meetings at the Department of Business\u000d\u000a      Innovation and Skills for the implementation of the Directive in September\u000d\u000a      2013 and a roundtable with the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Jo Swinson\u000d\u000a      in October 2013.\u000d\u000a    Work carried out by the UK Government's Department of Business,\u000d\u000a      Innovation and Skills also shows the impact of Prof H&#246;rnle's research. In\u000d\u000a      January 2008, she advised the then Consumer Affairs Minister Gareth Thomas\u000d\u000a      MP on consumer protection and e-commerce policy, dispute resolution for\u000d\u000a      consumers and ODR. In 2009, she provided advice to several of the\u000d\u000a      Department's Expert Group Meetings on e-commerce and consumer protection,\u000d\u000a      including a meeting with the then European Commissioner for Consumer\u000d\u000a      Protection, Meglena Kuneva. This work stream led to the preparation for\u000d\u000a      establishing a Consumer Advocate by the Labour Government in 2009\/2010\u000d\u000a      (see reference in Section 5 below).\u000d\u000a    In 2010, she was commissioned by the Department for Business, Innovation\u000d\u000a      and Skills to carry out an international and comparative study on the\u000d\u000a      Enforcement of Consumer Protection Law on the Internet and produced a\u000d\u000a      Research Report which contained many ideas and concepts articulated in her\u000d\u000a      previous research on ODR. The Research Report created an understanding of\u000d\u000a      the different approaches to enforcing consumer protection law in\u000d\u000a      cross-border internet cases by showcasing models for ODR in other\u000d\u000a      countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Denmark, Netherlands and\u000d\u000a      US) and extrapolating the lessons learned for the UK and including\u000d\u000a      recommendations for ODR in the UK.\u000d\u000a    In 2011, she provided consultancy for the BIS's stakeholder advisory\u000d\u000a      meetings on Online Dispute Resolution with the purpose of implementing an\u000d\u000a      ODR system for e-commerce in the UK, in view of the impending European\u000d\u000a      legislation (the ADR Directive and ODR Regulation on which she was\u000d\u000a      advising the EU Commission at that time).\u000d\u000a    Between November 2011 and March 2012, she provided advice and consultancy\u000d\u000a      to BIS, based on her previous research on ADR and ODR, which was used by\u000d\u000a      BIS to inform their work in relation to the Call for Evidence on the EU\u000d\u000a      Proposals on Alternative Dispute Resolution. The consultancy involved two\u000d\u000a      workshops at BIS and an unpublished research report. This work informed\u000d\u000a      BIS work on implementing the EU legislation on ODR and ADR and many of her\u000d\u000a      ideas and advice are reflected in BIS work, including the Call for\u000d\u000a      Evidence on ADR and the Government's Response. This work is ongoing and\u000d\u000a      BIS will issue a Consultation in January 2014.\u000d\u000a    Prof H&#246;rnle's research has also helped formulate the Chinese government's\u000d\u000a      approach to ODR. She acted as a Senior Expert to the Chinese government on\u000d\u000a      ODR as part of the EU-China Information Society Project from 2007-2009.\u000d\u000a      She consulted on four different projects in different regions of China\u000d\u000a      (with the Beijing, Guangzhou, Xian and Shanghai Arbitration Commissions).\u000d\u000a    Finally, Prof H&#246;rnle's was a panel member for the United Nations\u000d\u000a      Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)'s Working Group on Online\u000d\u000a      Dispute Resolution, attending meetings in Geneva (2001-2005) and Vienna\u000d\u000a      (2010), with her ideas helping to shape the discussion and build knowledge\u000d\u000a      of this new discipline.

The research describes how internet technology has the\u000d\u000a      potential to make the resolution of cross-border disputes involving\u000d\u000a      businesses, their suppliers and partners and consumers fairer, more\u000d\u000a      effective and less costly. Cross-border dispute resolution using national\u000d\u000a      courts is expensive and slow, in particular because national laws often\u000d\u000a      require complex or lengthy preliminary applications to determine the\u000d\u000a      competence of the courts involved. As a result there is often no access to\u000d\u000a      justice for consumers and small to medium-size enterprises involved in\u000d\u000a      these disputes. ODR can mitigate these issues, using internet connectivity\u000d\u000a      and systems such as online case management tools, secure\u000d\u000a      videoconferencing, web-forms and web filing platforms to enable disputes\u000d\u000a      to be managed via the world wide web. All of these make scheduling\u000d\u000a      mediation and arbitration sessions, managing documentation, and running\u000d\u000a      cases much more straightforward for participants and legal practitioners.\u000d\u000a    Prof H&#246;rnle's research, culminating in her 2009 book [1] examined the\u000d\u000a      standards to make ODR a fair dispute resolution process, focusing on due\u000d\u000a      process and the differences from offline processes such as arbitration and\u000d\u000a      mediation. The outcome of the research was to set out the fairness\u000d\u000a      standards with which ODR should comply, to show how these standards can be\u000d\u000a      implemented in the real world thus providing a blueprint of how ODR should\u000d\u000a      be devised to solve disputes such as business to consumer e-commerce\u000d\u000a      disputes, where the business and the consumer are based in different\u000d\u000a      countries.\u000d\u000a    Other work has focused on specific issues raised by ODR. Early work\u000d\u000a      looked at how ODR could work for consumers [2] who are often relatively\u000d\u000a      powerless when involved in disputes with large organisations, and research\u000d\u000a      the following year analysed legal issues raise by ODR &#8212; in particular\u000d\u000a      whether arbitration law and practices needed to be changed to accommodate\u000d\u000a      it [3].\u000d\u000a    In 2008, H&#246;rnle examined domain name dispute resolution as a specific\u000d\u000a      case study of ODR [4]. The case study used the large amount of\u000d\u000a      publicly-available data on these cases to examine whether ODR was fair as\u000d\u000a      well as efficient. Other work in 2008, carried out with Niall Lawless of\u000d\u000a      the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators on behalf of the EU-China\u000d\u000a      Information Society, investigated how ODR could be implemented in China\u000d\u000a      [5], and work in 2013 looked at UNCITRAL's (United Nations Commission on\u000d\u000a      International Trade Law) Proposals in the field of ODR, comparing those\u000d\u000a      with the EU Proposals [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18766","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    On April 26th 2013 the Department of Health published the \"Caldicott 2\"\u000a      report (formally, the Information\u000a        Governance Review, 2013) (henceforth, `the Review'), the most recent\u000a      systemic overview of patient\u000a      information governance in the NHS.\u000a    One member (Richard Wild) of the Steering Group that selected the Panel\u000a      which in turn conducted the\u000a      Information Governance Review, has noted in correspondence with Grace and\u000a      Taylor that:\u000a    \"Grace and Taylor's work changed the perspective of the review panel on\u000a      the issue of patient objection to the\u000a      use of confidential health information for purposes beyond direct care.\"\u000a    The Review, published by the Department of Health, duly highlighted the\u000a      piece published by Grace and\u000a      Taylor in the Medical Law Review, stating (p.79):\u000a    \"The Review Panel noted with interest the argument that the law requires\u000a      any reasonable objection to the\u000a      disclosure of personal confidential data to be respected\".\u000a    This argument was put forward by Grace and Taylor in their published\u000a      piece, as cited above etc..\u000a    The research by Grace and Taylor therefore can be said to have influenced\u000a      to an extent the Information\u000a        Governance Review, which included the following pertinent\u000a      recommendation in relation to the work of the\u000a      new National Health and Social Care Information Centre:\u000a    [Recommendation 11, Information Governance Review, 2013]\u000a    \"The Information Centre's code of practice should establish that an\u000a      individual's existing right to object to their\u000a      personal confidential data being shared, and to have that objection\u000a      considered, applies to both current and\u000a      future disclosures irrespective of whether they are mandated or permitted\u000a      by statute...

Consequently, G4S launched Project Genesis and\u000a        instigated staff training to facilitate greater appreciation of the\u000a        families' role in EM and improve interactions and communications with\u000a        them [E].\u000a      As a direct result of the concerns about staff safety uncovered by the\u000a        research, emergency response alarms were provided to all G4S working in\u000a        the community to reduce their anxieties and to provide a safer working\u000a        environment and therefore increase the length and quality of time spent\u000a        interacting with offenders.\u000a    \u000a    G4S stated in a letter from the Communications Director: `I cannot\u000a      emphasise enough the impact that the compliance research has had on our EM\u000a      business ... we continue to learn from this research and to make\u000a      operational changes based on its findings' [E].\u000a    (iii) Led to policy innovation through the setting up of\u000a          pilot projects: with the agreement of NOMS [A] [C],\u000a      G4S [E] [F] ran a pilot project in partnership with probation\u000a      trusts and the courts to test out different mechanisms recommended by Hucklesby's\u000a      research, with the aim of improving working practices and increasing\u000a      compliance rates. Mechanisms included: texting reminders to offenders\u000a      prior to installation, at the start of their curfews and when they are not\u000a      at their curfew address; rewards for complying; and practical help for\u000a      offenders with applying for changes to curfew requirements. Staff were\u000a      trained in motivational interviewing techniques and given greater\u000a      discretion when dealing with breaches. A second pilot was also initiated\u000a      to increase the compliance of female offenders &#8212; a group which the\u000a      research highlighted had lower compliance rates than men and different\u000a      experiences of EM to men.\u000a    Hucklesby acted as a consultant on both pilots, drawing on the\u000a      findings and recommendations of the research described in Section 2. One\u000a      aspect of the pilot project (texting) is referred to as an example of\u000a      innovative working in a government Green Paper [B] and a range of\u000a      the mechanisms have been rolled out across G4S EM operation and included\u000a      in the new EM contract specifications by NOMS.\u000a    (iv) Informed the work of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of\u000a          Probation (HMIP) and government responses to it, the research\u000a      supported recommendations relating to breach policies and enforcement\u000a      thresholds made in HMIP's 2008 thematic report of EM, which NOMS had\u000a      resisted implementing [G]. These recommendations included greater\u000a      levels of discretion when dealing with breaches and tighter but more\u000a      transparent enforcement thresholds. The research reinforced HMIP's unusual\u000a      decision to undertake a follow up thematic inspection of EM in 2012 which\u000a      focused specifically on the 2008 recommendations. HMIP noted that during\u000a      discussions with NOMS about its 2012 report there was `a more positive\u000a      attitude amongst NOMS officials to promoting compliance. It was clear...\u000a      that they were aware of Hucklesby's research and had been\u000a      influenced by it' [G]. HMIP was also aware that a pilot had been\u000a      implemented `as advocated in Hucklesby's research, which was said\u000a      to be producing positive results'. NOMS confirmed that their responses to\u000a      HMIP 2008 and 2012 EM reports were also informed by the research which\u000a      gave them a better understanding of EM and the factors that influence\u000a      compliance [A].\u000a    (v) Contributed to debates about the use of EM curfews\u000a          amongst magistrates and judges and other key stakeholders: The\u000a      findings relating to the correlation between compliance rates and the\u000a      length and duration of curfews (i.e. offenders were less likely to comply\u000a      if curfews were the maximum 12 hours, ended later in the morning and were\u000a      imposed for a maximum of 6 months) were fed back to magistrates and\u000a      judges. The aim was to persuade them to use EM curfews more smartly to\u000a      increase compliance i.e. to move away from routinely imposing 12 hour\u000a      curfews overnight 7 days a week for the duration of the order.\u000a    The findings have been used extensively in training with Youth Offending\u000a      and Probation Services to encourage them to: (i) make more targeted\u000a      recommendations to courts; and (ii) increase the value of curfews through\u000a      targeted use (e.g. imposing curfews as part of a strategy to address\u000a      offenders' behaviour) [E]. Additionally the research informed\u000a      debates at NOMS seminars across the country to `encourage more appropriate\u000a      use' [A].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A better understanding of electronic monitoring (EM) and improvements and\u000a      innovation in policy and practice have resulted from research conducted by\u000a      Professor Anthea Hucklesby.

In England and Wales, EM curfews are used\u000a      at all stages of the criminal justice system (pre-trial, sentencing and\u000a      early release from prison) and are the fastest growing community-based\u000a      tool &#8212; used for over 105,000 individuals per annum and costing &#163;116\u000a      million in 2011-12. The use of EM is also growing rapidly in Europe and\u000a      worldwide. EM is becoming increasingly important for a number of reasons.\u000a      In comparison to other community sanctions, EM enables greater levels of\u000a      surveillance and increases the likelihood of offenders being caught if\u000a      they fail to comply. It is also significantly cheaper than imprisonment\u000a      (the annual cost of EM curfews is under &#163;5k per offender compared with\u000a      over &#163;37k per year per prison place) and most other community sentences.\u000a    Several major concerns with community-based sentences which arguably\u000a      limit their use (in that they do not incapacitate and are regarded as soft\u000a      options) coalesce around issues of compliance. Improving compliance raises\u000a      courts' confidence in the effectiveness of EM curfews thereby increasing\u000a      their use. Breaches and re-offending would decline which in turn would\u000a      impact positively upon offenders' long-term desistance from offending [1],\u000a      resulting in significant cost savings and a safer society.\u000a    The research, conducted by Hucklesby (at Leeds since 2003 and\u000a      Senior Lecturer at the time of the research), directly engaged with these\u000a      important policy agendas by investigating empirically questions of\u000a      compliance with EM curfew orders. The research was funded by G4S Care and\u000a      Justice Services (then Securicor) one of the leading global private\u000a      security companies and the largest provider of EM worldwide, monitoring\u000a      40,000 individuals each day in countries including USA, Israel and\u000a      Australia. During 2005-6, Hucklesby used observations, statistical\u000a      data and interviews with offenders and staff to explore the extent of\u000a      non-compliance and what influences offenders' compliance.\u000a    Recorded breach rates were found to be significantly lower than reported\u000a      non-compliance because of the high breach thresholds set out in government\u000a      contracts. Nearly all offenders had not complied on multiple occasions.\u000a      Most non-compliance related to short time violations (e.g. being late for\u000a      the start of the curfew) and was reported to result from poor time\u000a      management and planning rather than deliberate acts [3] [4] [5].\u000a      At the time of the research, the official breach policy was confidential\u000a      and offenders did not have accurate knowledge of it [3] [4] [5].\u000a    The research found that offenders' compliance is shaped by a complex web\u000a      of factors, some of which could be influenced by relatively minor changes.\u000a      The factors identified include: how well the criminal justice system\u000a      prepares offenders for EM (i.e. providing information about EM);\u000a      offenders' perceptions about surveillance levels (how aware they are of\u000a      the requirements of their order and enforcement boundaries); the\u000a      efficiency of the technology; community ties (i.e. housing, employment and\u000a      family ties of offenders); and individual motivations of offenders\u000a      (whether they want to comply) [2] [3] [4] [5].\u000a    The research also identified ways in which staff influence offenders'\u000a      compliance. For example, it found that staff were not explaining EM\u000a      requirements to offenders and their families sufficiently, partly because\u000a      of concerns about their own personal safety when visiting offender's\u000a      homes. The research uncovered these feelings of insecurity and the link\u000a      with compliance &#8212; namely staff rushed to leave houses in which they felt\u000a      unsafe, reducing the thoroughness with which they completed tasks like\u000a      fitting equipment and explaining to offenders and their families what EM\u000a      entailed [3]. It also found that families play a vital role in\u000a      compliance, reminding offenders of their curfew requirements and taking\u000a      practical steps to ensure compliance such as picking offenders up [2].\u000a    The research identified several key areas of practice which, if adapted,\u000a      might increase compliance and bring about benefits for the company (e.g.\u000a      financial, increased credibility with government and criminal justice\u000a      agencies and competitive advantage), the criminal justice process (cost\u000a      savings and improved credibility) and the public (increased safety and\u000a      lower crime rates).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19031","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research and its key findings have been influential in\u000a      both the UK and overseas. Firstly, LA benefit fraud investigators have\u000a      engaged with the researcher to review their practices in light of the\u000a      researcher's findings, leading to a review of training needs and\u000a      identification of skills deficits, as well as requests to deliver findings\u000a      in other professional settings, alongside an engagement of the researcher\u000a      in strategic planning of the LA investigators' national forum. Thus far\u000a      the researcher has presented research findings to over 750 LA\u000a      investigation personnel in around 12 separate presentations (about 20% of\u000a      the total investigation personnel in the UK, and representing over 60% of\u000a      the 440 LAs.). Specific in-depth consultation has occurred in five of\u000a      these organisations, whilst other agencies and constituencies (such as the\u000a      police, Business,Information &amp; Skills' investigators, Gangmasters'\u000a      Licensing Authority, the East of England Fraud Forum, and the Welsh Fraud\u000a      Forum) have engaged with the researcher and asked him to present his\u000a      findings in various training\/ `masterclass' contexts, that has included\u000a      around 200 detectives undergoing initial training in Derbyshire and\u000a      Lincolnshire Constabularies. Evaluations of these sessions learned that\u000a      Walsh had positively influenced officers' thinking about interviewing\u000a      strategies. The GLA have recently engaged Walsh on a consultancy basis to\u000a      advise how to further boost investigative performance.\u000a    Other impacts include the provision of the research as an essential\u000a      component of the training of police officers overseas, where it is\u000a      estimated that over 2000 officers in the last three years have read the\u000a      researcher's study (Section 3, item 1) as prescribed in their training. As\u000a      part of a package of reading it is clearly difficult to make claims as to\u000a      its own discrete impact. However, this article is unique in that it shows\u000a      the association between skilful deployment of an interviewing framework\u000a      (that is steadily being embraced around the world) and optimum interview\u000a      outcomes (that is; a comprehensive reliable account). Anecdotal evidence\u000a      from trainers in Norway indicates that this article clearly overcomes\u000a      officers' concerns that the interviewing model better identifies the\u000a      guilty, while avoiding false confessions from the innocent. Professional\u000a      social media sites such as Linkedin have recently cited the researcher's\u000a      work as the only study of investigations outside the police (this was an\u000a      Australian view).\u000a    As a consequence of presenting research to Belgian Police, Walsh was\u000a      asked by (i) senior Belgian police officers to contribute to a handbook\u000a      for all Belgian Police officers' that advises how to disclose evidence in\u000a      light of recent ECtHR rulings that concern legal representation\u000a      requirements when criminal suspects are questioned about possible\u000a      offences; and (ii) by consultants to the Dutch government to provide\u000a      evidence for their report how the ECtHR rulings will likely affect police\u000a      investigations in the Netherlands.\u000a    Alongside this activity Walsh reported his findings from his first study\u000a      in 2007 at an international seminar that was attended by both academics\u000a      and practitioners interested in the study of the investigative\u000a      interviewing of victims, suspects, and witnesses. This led to Walsh (with\u000a      Dr Gavin Oxburgh, of Newcastle University, and Dr Trond Myklebust of the\u000a      Norwegian Police Training College) to create an organisation that was to\u000a      be the host for both practitioners and academics with an professional\u000a      interest in this area, with the aims of encouraging collaborative research\u000a      between the two groups and to enable a forum where best practices are\u000a      identified and spread world-wide. In the first five years since its\u000a      inception it has achieved both these aims. The organisation (the\u000a      International Investigative Interviewing Research Group &#8212; iIIRG) under the\u000a      stewardship of the three original founder members, has grown to over 300\u000a      members. Among its other successes are an annual international conference\u000a      (in each of the last five years) and masterclass (that regularly attracts\u000a      150 delegates from all over the world) and a biannual peer reviewed\u000a      journal; Investigative Interviewing: Research and Practice (of which Walsh\u000a      is its Editor-in chief) with contributions from both practitioners and\u000a      academics. The international reputation and credibility of Walsh's status\u000a      in this organisation is directly related to his studies in pioneering\u000a      research in hitherto untouched territories.

The underpinning\u000a      research for the case study is through eight published peer reviewed\u000a      articles (most published in at least 2* rated journals) and one book\u000a      chapter.\u000a    Walsh conducted his initial study in 2006, being funded (&#163;3,200) by the\u000a      Joint Working Initiative of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\u000a      This involved examination of various inspections of local authorities\u000a      (LAs) in the UK conducted by governmental auditing authorities. This\u000a      analysis (Section 3, Item 6) found beneficial effects on performance had\u000a      been realized during 1999-2007, believed to be associated by such\u000a      inspections. Such reporting to various LA and DWP fora by Walsh in 2006\u000a      engaged their interest in an examination of DWP\/LA benefit fraud\u000a      investigators. Walsh's subsequent analysis of their actual interviewing\u000a      performance conducted in 2007 found that most interviews were below\u000a      expected standards when using measurement scales designed to assess\u000a      interviewing skills. Such dissemination of this research to professional\u000a      LA fora in 2007\/2008 generally led to concerns regarding the research\u000a      findings, since these (unsurprisingly) did not match their voiced\u000a      perceptions of their own skill levels. Regardless, several users of the\u000a      research (such as DWP investigation trainers, and LA managers) did feel\u000a      that the findings had some substance and they supported Walsh in providing\u000a      further field data in order for him to undertake further studies.\u000a      Subsequent studies (Section 3, items 1 and 4) displayed how, when a\u000a      framework was most skillfully used it was associated with the gathering of\u000a      comprehensive, accurate and reliable accounts. These findings were shared\u000a      at professional and academic conferences in this country and overseas\u000a      during 2008-2009. Upon publication of its findings, the paper (Section 3,\u000a      item 1) was adopted as an integral component within training packages for\u000a      police detectives in Norway in 2010 and, later, China in 2011, being\u000a      translated into those countries' languages. Item 1 remains a prerequisite\u000a      for detectives to have read this article during their training in these\u000a      countries so as to inform them of the benefits of using information\u000a      gathering approaches when interviewing suspects. More than 2,000\u000a      detectives are estimated to have used Walsh's study as part of their\u000a      training. Meanwhile, the researcher engaged with 114 UK professionals in\u000a      various fora, (also in 2008-2009) undertaking an attitudinal survey (see\u000a      item 3, Section 3), finding further areas of concern. Further\u000a      dissemination of studies to over 1400 academic and investigation\u000a      professionals (from various agencies and countries) occurred during\u000a      2009-2013 (Section 3, items 2, 5, 6), directly leading to further\u000a      engagement to undertake collaborative research and consultancy.\u000a    The research is unique since despite over 150,000 interviews being\u000a      conducted each year by benefit fraud investigators, no other research has\u000a      been undertaken to this depth concerning their interview practices\u000a      (research has focused in the past examined police investigations, and thus\u000a      until this research we remained unaware of the performance of other\u000a      agencies). Further, the findings from these studies have informed service\u000a      users overseas who possess unfamiliarity with this model of interviewing\u000a      criminal suspects.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20916","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"587116","Name":"Azerbaijan"},{"GeoNamesId":"174982","Name":"Armenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"617790","Name":"Moldova"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The recommendations of the Country Reports have had a far-reaching impact\u000a      on the treatment of\u000a      prisoners, from top-level regulatory and legislative change to encouraging\u000a      investment in training\u000a      and awareness-raising.

As part of these changes\u000a      the Georgian authorities\u000a      established an Inter&#8212;Agency Coordination Council against Torture as well\u000a      as establishing a\u000a      strategy against torture. The working group drafted this directly on the\u000a      basis of the\u000a      recommendations set out in the detailed Country Report. The Georgian\u000a      authorities also adopted an\u000a      Action Plan (2011-13) against torture, again in line with the Country\u000a      Report and its\u000a      recommendations [1].\u000a    Additionally, as part of its response to the recommendations in Murdoch's\u000a      Country Report, Georgia\u000a      adopted a new Criminal Procedure Code in 2010 which introduced new\u000a      safeguards against ill-\u000a      treatment and other human rights violations [2].\u000a    Ukraine\u000a      As recommended by the Country Report, a Presidential Working Group on\u000a      Criminal Justice Reform\u000a      was established and tasked with developing an independent mechanism for\u000a      investigating\u000a      allegations of ill-treatment. The Commission for the Prevention of\u000a      Torture was established in the\u000a      Ukraine by Presidential Decree in September 2011 [3].\u000a    Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs picked up several more\u000a      recommendations from the report. In\u000a      August 2010 the Minister issued a memo instructing that all detainees\u000a      receive an information\u000a      leaflet about their rights, whilst in March 2011 a new Regulation was\u000a      issued to combat ill-treatment\u000a      and ensure its effective investigation. This new regulation requires the\u000a      inspection of all detention\u000a      facilities by Ministry staff and the installation of video recording\u000a      equipment to all interrogation\u000a      rooms, along with the continued distribution of the information leaflet [4].\u000a    At the time of writing, the Ukraine is working to have free Legal Aid\u000a      Centres established in every\u000a      region [5], as outlined in the Ukrainian Law on Free Legal Aid\u000a      adopted on 2 June 2011 following\u000a      the recommendation of the Country Report.\u000a    In addition to this new law, November 2012 saw the implementation of a\u000a      revised Ukrainian Criminal\u000a      Procedure Code which asserts witness' right to a lawyer, establishes an\u000a      independent mechanism\u000a      to investigate ill-treatment and renders confessions obtained where the\u000a      defendant's lawyer was\u000a      absent as inadmissible [6].\u000a    The commitment to also addressing Murdoch's concerns about cultural\u000a      change is evident in a letter\u000a      from Ukraine's Deputy Prosecutor General to all Regional Prosecutors,\u000a      which emphasises the\u000a      importance of the Joint Programme. The letter requires prosecutors to\u000a      \"apply a systemic approach\u000a      to an effective use of all their statutory powers in order to prevent and\u000a      to counteract illegal violence\u000a      by the law enforcement personnel.

The\u000a      monograph was\u000a      also published in French in 2007.\u000a    Over the course of his research, Murdoch maintained a strong working\u000a      relationship with the\u000a      Council of Europe, and in 2009 he was appointed as one of two long-term\u000a      experts on the Joint\u000a      Programme of the European Union and the Council of Europe into Combating\u000a      Impunity through the\u000a      Introduction of Effective Investigations. The Joint Programme sought to\u000a      investigate allegations of\u000a      ill-treatment at police-led detention centres in five `beneficiary\u000a      states': the Ukraine, Georgia,\u000a      Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Moldova.\u000a    The Ukraine and Georgia's failure to address the deep-seated use of\u000a      ill-treatment by police officers\u000a      or to carry out effective investigations had repeatedly attracted the\u000a      attention of the European Court\u000a      of Human Rights. Murdoch led a mission to the Ukraine and Georgia which\u000a      aimed to understand\u000a      precisely why the measures overseen by the Council of Europe were not\u000a      being successfully\u000a      implemented by the countries' leadership. Murdoch's co-expert, Eric\u000a      Svanidze (former member of\u000a      the CPT) undertook similar investigations in Armenia, Azerbaijan and\u000a      Moldova.\u000a    Murdoch's four-month investigation in 2009 involved detailed\u000a      semi-structured interviews with\u000a      Ministers, senior officials, judges, judicial training institutes,\u000a      lawyers' associations, NGOs and\u000a      international organisations working across different regions in each\u000a      country. His research also\u000a      sought to establish whether domestic legal models and norms were\u000a      compatible with international\u000a      and European standards.\u000a    The key findings and recommendations gleaned from these investigations\u000a      were published in five\u000a      Country Reports and disseminated at seminars for high-ranking officials.\u000a      Due to issues of political\u000a      sensitivity in respect of the Georgian Country Report and activities, this\u000a      case study will focus\u000a      predominantly on the investigation undertaken in Ukraine.\u000a    Prior to the Joint Programme, the CPT had only been able to make very\u000a      short, ad hoc visits to the\u000a      5 beneficiary states. The Joint Programme involved the first examination\u000a      of the legislative,\u000a      organisational and cultural barriers to the effective investigation of\u000a      allegations of ill-treatment.\u000a      Murdoch's work provided in-depth insights into these barriers, with the\u000a      Country Report for Ukraine\u000a      recommending:\u000a    \u000a      The establishment of an independent agency to investigate complaints\u000a        against ill-treatment.\u000a        The report found that this role is usually filled by Prosecutors, who\u000a        may have a conflict of\u000a        interest with pursuing such complaints in that they could jeopardise a\u000a        conviction;\u000a      That general attitudes and values needed to change;\u000a      The implementation of draft legislation on free legal aid for detained\u000a        suspects\u000a      Audio and\/or visual recordings of all interrogations; and\u000a      That consideration be given to reforming the Code of Criminal\u000a        Procedure to render\u000a        confessions inadmissible unless given in the presence of the detainee's\u000a        legal\u000a        representative.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20930","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The incidence of domestic abuse in Scotland has risen steadily since the\u000d\u000a      recording of data began in 1999-2000. In that year the eight police forces\u000d\u000a      in Scotland recorded a total of 33,197 incidents of domestic abuse. By\u000d\u000a      2005-06 this had increased to 45,796 incidents, of which 23,983 were\u000d\u000a      recorded as a crime or offence. These resulted in 15,134 reports to the\u000d\u000a      Procurator Fiscal, an increase of 67% since 1999-2000. The vast majority\u000d\u000a      of incidents of domestic abuse (88%) are perpetrated against female\u000d\u000a      victims and likewise, the vast majority of perpetrators (87%) are male.\u000d\u000a      Repeat victimisation is common among victims of domestic abuse. In 2005-06\u000d\u000a      just over half (51%) of reported incidents involved known repeat victims.\u000d\u000a    The research by Connelly at the University of Glasgow was instrumental in\u000d\u000a      shaping legislative change and improving access to justice for victims of\u000d\u000a      domestic abuse, and providing the resources required for practitioners in\u000d\u000a      this field to identify and engage in best practice across Scotland.\u000d\u000a    Shaping legislative change: Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2011\u000d\u000a      Connelly's study identified the institutional barriers to assistance faced\u000d\u000a      by (primarily) women experiencing domestic abuse. On the strength of her\u000d\u000a      research, Connelly was asked to advise Rhoda Grant, Member of the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Parliament (Labour, Highlands &amp; Islands) on the drafting of a Private\u000d\u000a      Member's Bill (the Civil Protection Orders and Access to Justice Bill)\u000d\u000a      originally intended to address the issue of access to Legal Aid by\u000d\u000a      domestic abuse victims. Grant's Bill, which became law in March 2011, was\u000d\u000a      amended to include two main barriers identified in Connelly's research\u000d\u000a      which had not been addressed by the proposed legislation. This Bill now\u000d\u000a      provides important protection for victims of domestic abuse that had not\u000d\u000a      existed before, specifically:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Scotland now has named domestic abuse interdicts;\u000d\u000a      Breaching protection orders is now a criminal offence; and\u000d\u000a      Victims can now obtain a protective order on the basis of one incident\u000d\u000a        where previously they had to experience repeated incidents before a\u000d\u000a        crime was seen to be committed.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    During a speech in the Scottish Parliament, Holyrood (16 March 2011),\u000d\u000a      Rhona Grant MSP directly thanked Connelly for developing the `solution\u000d\u000a        for how the bill could be shaped to tackle the issues.'

Based on her research findings and expertise in this area,\u000d\u000a      Connelly was also commissioned by the Scottish Government to produce an\u000d\u000a      evidence-based toolkit to guide Sheriffs Principal in rolling out the\u000d\u000a      specialist response to domestic abuse across Scotland. She authored\u000d\u000a      `Handling Domestic Abuse: A Toolkit to Aid the Development of Specialist\u000d\u000a      Approaches to Cases of Domestic Abuse' in May 2008. The Toolkit evaluated\u000d\u000a      the specialist court set up and piloted since 2006 and is aimed at\u000d\u000a      practitioners in this field of the criminal justice system to help them\u000d\u000a      develop an informed, specialised approach to dealing with cases of\u000d\u000a      domestic abuse; it is now used throughout Scotland. The Toolkit has\u000d\u000a      enabled the Scottish Government to develop a successful Domestic Abuse\u000d\u000a      Court model by providing expert guidance to sheriffs and other court\u000d\u000a      personnel making policy decisions within their courts on key issues such\u000d\u000a      as the safety of complainers, independent advocacy, victim clustering and\u000d\u000a      fast-tracking of cases.\u000d\u000a    Influencing the work of NGOs\u000d\u000a      Both impacts outlined above have influenced the work of NGOs that work\u000d\u000a      with those subjected to domestic abuse, including Scottish Women's Aid,\u000d\u000a      the Women's Support Project and ASSIST, the specialist domestic abuse\u000d\u000a      advocacy service that provides advocacy and support to victims of domestic\u000d\u000a      abuse.

The introduction of the\u000d\u000a        Domestic Abuse court and training \/ awareness raising activity around\u000d\u000a        the court opening brought a marked improvement in the process for\u000d\u000a        victims of abuse. The shorter wait for cases to go to trial was\u000d\u000a        generally welcomed, and encouraged women to contact the police and to\u000d\u000a        make complaints.

To that end they commissioned Dunn to undertake this\u000d\u000asocio-legal research.\u000d\u000aWith this role in mind, Dunn's research formed a crucial building block in the Law Commission's\u000d\u000ainitial 2003 consultation paper, enabling the Law Commission to understand and contextualise the\u000d\u000aprevalence, role and use of trustee exemption clauses as well as the views of trustees, settlors and\u000d\u000atheir legal advisors on the importance of the clauses (ibid). The importance of the work was\u000d\u000arecognised at the time by the Law Commission which, in its Annual Report of 2003, stated that the\u000d\u000a\"socio-legal research carried out by Dr Alison Dunn at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne\u000d\u000agreatly informed our work on Trustee Exemption Clauses\" (IMP1), work which resulted in the\u000d\u000aGovernment's subsequent decision to introduce a non-statutory rule of disclosure.\u000d\u000aFollowing consultation the Law Commission's final recommendations on trustee exemption clauses\u000d\u000awere published in 2006 (IMP2). The responses to the Law Commission's consultation paper\u000d\u000amapped on to and reinforced the findings from Dunn's research: \"The consultation process has\u000d\u000aprovided significant support for the claims reported by Dr Dunn\" (para 5.98) (IMP2). Whilst the Law\u000d\u000aCommission was keen in its consultation paper to propose statutory regulation, responses to the\u000d\u000aLaw Commission's consultation paper reinforced Dunn's research findings that there was a danger\u000d\u000aof economically and socially damaging over-regulation in this field (para 5.97) (IMP2). As a result,\u000d\u000athe findings of the underpinning research as to the risk of over-regulation and the consultation\u000d\u000aresponses influenced a change of approach by the Law Commission in its final report: \"The\u000d\u000aimpression that settlors may not fully appreciate the import of trustee exemption clauses is\u000d\u000asupported by Dr Dunn's socio-economic research. This found that settlors are generally not well\u000d\u000ainformed about or particularly concerned with trustee exemption clauses, considering such clauses\u000d\u000ato be largely \"administrative\" provisions.\" (paras 3.38, 5.17, 5.19 and 6.8) (IMP2). The\u000d\u000aunderpinning research therefore facilitated a more economically and practically appropriate form of\u000d\u000aregulation in this branch of law.\u000d\u000aConsequently the Law Commission's final recommendations in 2006 abandoned their initial\u000d\u000aproposal for statutory regulation prohibiting certain types of exemption clauses and instead put\u000d\u000aforward a proposal for a new non-statutory rule of practice governing disclosure and explanation of\u000d\u000aexemption clauses. Such a non-statutory rule meets two of the key requirements identified by\u000d\u000aDunn's research which were that: (i) there needed to be some regulation of trustee exemption\u000d\u000aclauses to protect creators of trusts and those who benefit from a trust; and (ii) there needed to be\u000d\u000abetter information available about trustee exemption clauses because those creators of trusts often\u000d\u000ahave a lack of knowledge and understanding of the existence, role and import of trustees'\u000d\u000aexemption clauses and a general misunderstanding of the administration of trusts. This proposal\u000d\u000afor a new non-statutory rule has the effect of changing the law by setting out a positive obligation\u000d\u000arequiring paid trustees to take reasonable steps to ensure that the creator of a trust is fully\u000d\u000ainformed of the meaning and effect of a trustee exemption clause before the trust is made (thereby\u000d\u000aallowing the creator of the trust the opportunity, once fully informed, to reject the clause). This\u000d\u000arecommendation by the Law Commission was praised by the Better Regulation Executive as \"a\u000d\u000aproportionate risk-based approach to the issue\" (page 8) (IMP3).\u000d\u000aIn 2010 the Ministry of Justice formally accepted the Law Commission's final recommendations\u000d\u000aand its proposal for a new non-statutory rule of practice governing disclosure and explanation of\u000d\u000aexemption clauses (which, as noted above, were informed by the research). This new regulation\u000d\u000aand change of law was reported to Parliament along with a statement that the Ministry of Justice\u000d\u000awould be writing to representatives of the trust industry in England and Wales to encourage\u000d\u000aexpress adoption of the new rule within their codes of practices (IMP4, IMP5).\u000d\u000aAs a result, post-2010 the new non-statutory rule of disclosure has been widely adopted by the\u000d\u000atrust industry in England and Wales (IMP6). This is a group of significant size (numbering their\u000d\u000amillions) given that the trust is a principal vehicle for the holding of private wealth in England and\u000d\u000aWales. Trusts are widely used in commercial and family contexts through settlements, wills,\u000d\u000apensions, financial instruments (including international financial investments), charities and other\u000d\u000athird sector organisations (many of which operate internationally). Alongside adoption by the trust\u000d\u000aindustry, the trust sector regulatory bodies have developed their own codes of practice to ensure\u000d\u000acompliance with the new regulation, such as the Law Society (which regulates the legal profession)\u000d\u000aand the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners (which has a membership of over 17,000 and is\u000d\u000athe leading professional body for trust practitioners) see for example (IMP7). In light of the extent of\u000d\u000athe trust industry, the new non-statutory rule of practice governing disclosure and explanation of\u000d\u000aexemption clauses that has been introduced has widespread application in England and Wales\u000d\u000awith the purpose of protecting both creators of trusts and those who benefit from them. The rule\u000d\u000ahas also formed the basis of reform proposals in other jurisdictions, such as in the recent proposed\u000d\u000areforms in New Zealand, where the regulation of trustee exemption clauses is being actively\u000d\u000adebated. The New Zealand Law Commission has recently proposed that trustee exemption\u000d\u000aclauses be regulated through a non-statutory rule of disclosure adapted from the one introduced in\u000d\u000aEngland and Wales (IMP8).\u000d\u000aThe Chief Executive of the Law Commission has confirmed \"I hereby endorse the claims for impact\u000d\u000aas stated in the impact case study submitted by Dr Dunn. The Law Commission is grateful to Dr\u000d\u000aDunn for the research that she conducted on its behalf.

Newcastle research had a direct impact upon the development of the law on trustee\u000d\u000aexemption clauses. In 2002 Dunn successfully tendered to undertake research on trustee\u000d\u000aexemption clauses in England and Wales on behalf of the Law Commission.

Trustee exemption clauses allow a trustee (the person who\u000d\u000amanages the trust and its assets) to be exempt from liability for breach of trust in all circumstances\u000d\u000aexcept fraud. This means a trustee can be exempt from liability for negligence. The question of\u000d\u000athe regulation of trustee exemption clauses was referred by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine to the\u000d\u000aLaw Commission (an advisory non-departmental public body sponsored by the Ministry of Justice\u000d\u000awhich reviews the law and recommends changes) for consideration in 2000 (see HL Hansard 14\u000d\u000aApril 2000, Col394\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/ld199900\/ldhansrd\/vo000414\/text\/00414-02.htm). This\u000d\u000awas the result of criticisms raised in the Court of Appeal about the existence and extent of trustee\u000d\u000aexemption clauses in England and Wales and in which Lord Millett invited Parliament to consider\u000d\u000athe issue (see Lord Justice Millett, Armitage v Nurse [1997] 3 WLR 1046).\u000d\u000aBefore embarking on a consideration of whether and how the law concerning trustee exemption\u000d\u000aclauses should be reformed, the Law Commission recognised that it first needed to understand the\u000d\u000aprevalence, role and use of trustee exemption clauses in England and Wales to determine if they\u000d\u000awere \"sufficiently widespread to warrant intervention\" (Law Commission, Trustee Exemption\u000d\u000aClauses, Law Com No 301, Cm6874, June 2006, para 3.28). The Law Commission also needed\u000d\u000ato consider what mode of intervention might be appropriate. In 2002 the Law Commission invited 6\u000d\u000aacademic experts in the field of trust law and socio-legal studies to tender for the funding to\u000d\u000aundertake the research on their behalf. This was a competitive tendering process by invitation\u000d\u000aonly. Dunn had an established reputation in the field on the basis of outputs in leading law\u000d\u000ajournals including the Modern Law Review and Legal Studies and as editor of a book with leading\u000d\u000alaw publisher Hart Publishing (set out in Dunn's publication profile up to 2002 at\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/www.ncl.ac.uk\/nuls\/staff\/profile\/alison.dunn#tab_publications) and was one of the 6 invited to\u000d\u000atender. Dunn's successful tender bid received funding of c. &#163;40,000.\u000d\u000aDunn undertook socio-legal research in Feb-May 2002 on behalf of and funded by the Law\u000d\u000aCommission. This research involved an extensive empirical study targeting the key actors with the\u000d\u000athree core groups in the practitioner community: (1) professional representative bodies, institutions\u000d\u000aand banks (including Association of British Insurers, Association of Corporate Trustees, Bar\u000d\u000aCouncil, Charity Commission, Chartered Insurance Institute, Law Society, Society of Trust and\u000d\u000aEstate Practitioners, National Association of Pension Funds, Institute of Actuaries); (2) professional\u000d\u000aand lay trustees; and (3) legal advisers to trustees and creators of trusts (termed `settlors').\u000d\u000aHaving successfully tendered to the Law Commission to undertake the research to inform the\u000d\u000aCommission's thinking on the subject, the findings of Dunn's research were published by the Law\u000d\u000aCommission as a specific and distinct chapter in its trustee exemption clauses consultation\u000d\u000adocument (1), Part III). Dunn's research revealed previously unknown data on the role and impact\u000d\u000aof trustee exemption clauses, the attitude of trustees towards the clauses and whether regulation\u000d\u000aof such clauses would have an impact on investment of wealth in England and Wales. The\u000d\u000aresearch identified a broader range of issues relating to the commercial reality of day-to-day trust\u000d\u000adecisions, the difficulty of balancing freedom and autonomy of those who wish to create a trust with\u000d\u000aprotection of the beneficiaries of trusts, the multi-layered nature of the trust and the transparency of\u000d\u000athe sector in which trusts operate.\u000d\u000aDunn's research and its findings on trustee exemption clauses on behalf of the Law Commission\u000d\u000awas the first of its kind in England and Wales, and there are no comparator studies in other\u000d\u000acountries. The research is an original statement on the use of trustee exemption clauses in\u000d\u000apractice and it makes previously unexplored linkages between the regulation of trusts and the\u000d\u000achallenges faced by those who wish to create trusts and have to administer them. The research\u000d\u000ahas international relevance not just as a point of comparison for other common law countries that\u000d\u000aalso have trustee exemption clauses, but also as an analytical foundation for developing key\u000d\u000aconcepts in this legal area, for example in New Zealand.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"21700","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has alerted the UN and the EU to the argument that article\u000a      18 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\u000a      (hereinafter, the Charter) recognises the right of individuals not merely\u000a      to seek asylum and therefore not to be returned to persecution, but\u000a      also the right to be granted asylum. The United Nations High\u000a      Commissioner for Refugees (hereinafter, UNHCR) has abandoned its\u000a      traditional position and now advocates an interpretation of article 18 of\u000a      the Charter that encompasses the broader interpretation argued for in the\u000a      underpinning research, basing its position on the analysis put forward in\u000a      the research. As the UNHCR is an Agency of the United Nations, this change\u000a      in policy affects 193 countries in the world (out of 196 existing\u000a      countries). The research has also influenced the way in which secondary EU\u000a      legislation (adopted in 2011) has developed the right to asylum in the\u000a      Charter, which includes the obligation of EU member states to grant\u000a      asylum. Lawyers have cited the research before the Court of Justice of the\u000a      EU and it has led to changes in judicial attitudes to the right to asylum\u000a      in EU law, as well as to changes in attitudes by practitioners\u000a      representing refugees before administrative and judicial institutions.\u000a    The research has been applied in a number of ways, generating\u000a      international impact of universal scope (United Nations) and of regional\u000a      scope (EU institutions) by shaping the law and policy of international\u000a      organisations (the UN and the EU).\u000a    The research changed the policy of the United Nations High Commissioner\u000a      for Refugees. The UNHCR, represented by Raza Hussain QC from Matrix\u000a      Chambers (IMP1), cited the research in its written and oral\u000a      submissions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in\u000a        N.S. v Secretary of State for the Home Department (C-411\/10) (IMP2-3).\u000a      The UNHCR used the research to support its argument regarding the correct\u000a      (purposive) interpretation of article 18 of the Charter of Fundamental\u000a      Rights of the European Union. When challenging the traditional narrow\u000a      interpretation of the right to asylum, the UNHCR's written submissions\u000a      read as follows: \"The scope of the right protected by Article 18 goes\u000a      beyond protection from refoulement. [ftnt 35: For a comprehensive\u000a      analysis leading to this conclusion see M-T Gil-Bazo, The Charter of\u000a      Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the right to be granted\u000a      asylum in the Union's Law [2008], Refugee Survey Quarterly, vol.\u000a      27 no. 3, pages 33-52 (Annex 21).]\" (February 2011) (IMP2).\u000a    Given the relevance of the detailed argumentation in the research, the\u000a      UNHCR also submitted the publication to the Court of Justice of the\u000a      European Union (hereinafter, CJEU) as an Annex to its written submissions\u000a      in N.S. v Secretary of State for the Home Department (C-411\/10).\u000a      This was the only academic paper submitted by the UNHCR to the Court in\u000a      support of its arguments (p. 41, February 2011) (IMP2).\u000a    THE UNHCR cited the research again in its `Statement on the Right To\u000a      Asylum', submitted to the CJEU in the case of Zuheyr Freyeh Halaf v\u000a        the Bulgarian State Agency for Refugees (C-528\/11) to support its\u000a      statement that \"[t]he scope of the right protected by Article 18 goes\u000a      beyond protection from refoulement\" (para. 2.2.8.) (IMP4).\u000a    The underpinning research has changed perceptions of asylum by members of\u000a      the European judiciary. Judge Lennaerts of the CJEU writing\u000a      extra-judicially in an article published by the International and\u000a        Comparative Law Quarterly (2010, Vol. 59(2), at 289) endorsed and\u000a      cited the broader interpretation argued for in the underpinning research (IMP5).\u000a      The underpinning research also had impact in the proposal and adoption of\u000a      EU secondary legislation on asylum. The European Commission (June 2008)\u000a      and the European Parliament (October 2011) invited Gil-Bazo to give expert\u000a      advice on the reform of asylum legislation.\u000a    In the context of the Commission's proposal for legislative reform on\u000a      asylum, the European Commission held an Expert Meeting with government\u000a      officials, UNHCR, judges and academics on 26 June 2008. Gil-Bazo was one\u000a      of the seven European academics invited by the Commission to present her\u000a      views on the implications of article 18 for the reform of EU asylum\u000a      legislation. In October 2009, the European Commission submitted its\u000a      proposal for the recast Directive on international protection including\u000a      the right of individuals to be granted protection. Moreover, the\u000a      Commission referred to the meeting of June 2008 as one of the background\u000a      sources for its proposal (http:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/LexUriServ\/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0551:FIN:EN:PDF,\u000a      p. 3). The Deputy Head of Unit, from the European Commission, states that\u000a      Gil-Bazo's research \"was the only one [source\/output] that had so\u000a      thoroughly researched the international context and rigorously analysed\u000a      the content and implications of this specific provision of the Charter. It\u000a      proved therefore a precious source of information &#8212; and inspiration &#8212; for\u000a      our revision of the Qualification Directive\" (IMP6).\u000a    The Commission's proposal was the subject of negotiations in the Council\u000a      of Ministers of the EU and in the European Parliament. In this context, in\u000a      October 2011 the European Parliament held a hearing of experts to present\u000a      their views on the outstanding issues in the negotiations and invited\u000a      Gil-Bazo to address the European Parliament. Thereafter (on 13 December\u000a      2011), the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers of the\u000a      European Union adopted Directive 2011\/95\/EU. Recital 16 of this\u000a      Directive's Preamble states that it \"respects ... the right to asylum of\u000a      applicants for asylum\" set out in article 18 of the EU Charter of\u000a      Fundamental Rights. Accordingly, the legislative text includes (in\u000a      articles 13 and 18 of the Directive) an express obligation on member\u000a      states to grant asylum to individuals who meet the criteria (http:\/\/eur-lex.europa.eu\/LexUriServ\/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:337:0009:0026:EN:PDF).\u000aAsylum\u000a      has thus become a subjective right of individuals guaranteed by EU\u000a      secondary legislation. The member of The European Parliament Secretariat\u000a      responsible for the procedure towards adoption of this Directive says that\u000a      with Gil-Bazo's \"clear, quick, duly justified legal answers we were able\u000a      to tackle problems in legislative work at a technical, i.e. legal level\u000a      that were acceptable for all parties involved\" (IMP7).\u000a    The Special Issue of the Refugee Survey Quarterly in which the\u000a      underpinning research was published was formally presented in 2008 to the\u000a      meeting of the UNHCR Executive Committee, made up of government and UN\u000a      officials. This made possible rapid dissemination of results among users\u000a      and beneficiaries, in particular among UNHCR personnel, and led to\u000a      invitations to provide expert legal advice and\/or training to the UNHCR,\u000a      the European Union and, practitioners and NGOs, allowing for the further\u000a      dissemination of results to end users. UNHCR Bureau for Europe's Head of\u000a      Policy and Legal Support Unit says that Gil-Bazo's research \"has helped us\u000a      develop arguments that have formed central elements in recent\u000a      interventions before the Court of Justice of the EU [...]. We have also\u000a      used it extensively in interventions and discussions with states on\u000a      individual cases at national level; as well as in arguments around\u000a      legislation and practical procedures that should operate in Member States\u000a      in line with fundamental rights and protection principles [...]. We\u000a      believe that [Gil Bazo's] analysis &#8212; which looks into aspects of the\u000a      Charter's drafting history that are not otherwise documented &#8212; will\u000a      continue to provide an important foundation for much of our future work\" (IMP8).\u000a    The research has also changed attitudes among practitioners involved in\u000a      litigation on refugee rights. Following the entry into force of the EU\u000a      Lisbon Treaty in December 2009, the European Legal Network on Asylum\u000a      (ELENA) concluded that it was important to train its members (legal\u000a      practitioners across Europe) on the litigation possibilities offered by\u000a      the new legal framework, notably the legally binding nature of the Charter\u000a      of Fundamental Rights of the EU. To this end, it organised a course on The\u000a        Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human\u000a        Rights as \"asylum courts\" where Gil-Bazo presented the underpinning\u000a      research (May 2010). At this event, ELENA also distributed hard copies of\u000a      the underpinning research. Likewise, the Academy of European Law\u000a      (established by the European Union in 1992 in order to train lawyers\u000a      across Europe for the better application of EU Law; www.era.int)\u000a      invited Gil-Bazo in October 2012 to deliver its annual training on EU\u000a      asylum law on the specific impact of the Charter in the field of EU asylum\u000a      law. In making this commitment to human rights-related capacity-building,\u000a      ELENA has contributed to the dissemination of results among end users and\u000a      beneficiaries across Europe. The Senior Legal and Policy Officer from the\u000a      European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE) says that Gil-Bazo's\u000a      research \"has been an `eye-opener' to many lawyers active in the field of\u000a      asylum and refugee protection. It has provided new insights into its\u000a      potential meaning, not only from a purely academic perspective but also\u000a      from a practitioner's perspective. In arguing convincingly that the right\u000a      to asylum must be interpreted as enhancing the subjective nature of the\u000a      right of individuals to be granted asylum when they meet the criteria\u000a      beyond the traditional interpretation of asylum, it has strengthened the\u000a      argumentation used in individual cases but also in policy documents.\" (IMP9).\u000a      Questionnaires completed anonymously by participants at an Asylum Workshop\u000a      held in Brussels on 24 June 2013 show excellent feedback regarding the\u000a      Workshop's ability to raise their awareness, improve their understanding,\u000a      identify good practice and\/or policies, and introduce them to new\u000a      approaches concerning the protection of the subjective right. One\u000a      participant wrote: \"an excellent workshop, bringing together a very strong\u000a      mix of academics and practitioners. It will certainly serve as the basis\u000a      for further work and research within this field\" (IMP10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research has changed the conceptualisation among policy-makers and\u000a      practitioners of the nature of the right to asylum (from a right of states\u000a      to grant it to a right of individuals to receive it). The research has led\u000a      to a change in the law and policy of the United Nations and of the\u000a      European Union in this field. According to UN data, an estimated 441,300\u000a      asylum claims were lodged in industrialised countries in 2011,\u000a      representing an increase of 20% in relation to the previous year.

Gil-Bazo has been an academic at\u000a      Newcastle University for the duration of the research, which examines the\u000a      existence of a right to be granted asylum under article 18 of the Charter\u000a      of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU) (2000). The research\u000a      interprets article 18's content and scope by reference to international\u000a      law, the constitutional traditions common to the EU's member states, and\u000a      the drafting history of this provision. The research sheds light on the\u000a      legislative process and on the will of the legislator by identifying the\u000a      positions of the various national delegations to the Convention that\u000a      drafted the Charter. In light of this investigation, the research\u000a      establishes that those applying article 18 should reject a literal\u000a      interpretation and adopt a purposive (teleological) one.\u000a    This research challenges traditional conceptions of asylum in\u000a      international law that deny the existence of a right to be granted asylum.\u000a      The traditional position argues that international law recognises only a\u000a      procedural right to apply for asylum and not to be sent back to\u000a      persecution (non-refoulement). This traditional view understands\u000a      the granting of asylum as a discretionary right or state prerogative.\u000a      Moreover, it reflects the long-established practice of states to grant\u000a      asylum in the exercise of their sovereignty.\u000a    Gil-Bazo's research challenges this long-settled view of asylum. She\u000a      argues that in the current state of international law, and by virtue of\u000a      legally binding general principles and international human rights\u000a      treaties, asylum is not only a right of states to grant; rather,\u000a      individuals now have a right to receive it. A teleological interpretation\u000a      of article 18 within the broader context of the EU's legal order as a\u000a      system of law leads to this conclusion. Gil-Bazo's research thus contests\u000a      the idea of state sovereignty in the control of its population (one of the\u000a      defining elements of statehood).\u000a    The findings of the underpinning research regarding the content and scope\u000a      of the right to asylum in Europe have significant potential for on-going\u000a      and future impact. This is because they have altered attitudes within the\u000a      United Nations by contributing to renewed interest (among UN personnel) in\u000a      the institution of asylum (as a concept different from refugee status). In\u000a      order to identify the viability of conducting further research in the\u000a      field, the UNHCR granted Gil-Bazo a Small Research Grant (July &#8212; November\u000a      2012) of $3,500 to map state practice in Latin America and Africa, in\u000a      order to obtain a picture of asylum across different legal systems in the\u000a      world. The findings of this new research have been published in the New\u000a      Research Issues Series of UNHCR in January 2013: http:\/\/www.unhcr.org\/50e6d9a69.html.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21701","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research was designed to involve key stakeholders and interest groups\u000d\u000a      in an iterative process leading to the collaborative production of\u000d\u000a      relevant research outputs, and to maximise its impact.

It is also \"open access\" land for\u000d\u000a      public recreation. The complexity of the property rights to which common\u000d\u000a      land is subject make it difficult to manage; and especially difficult to\u000d\u000a      manage in a way that secures environmental benefits for the rare habitats\u000d\u000a      and flora\/fauna that it often supports. There are 540,000 hectares of\u000d\u000a      registered common land in England and Wales, much of which is designated\u000d\u000a      under European or national environmental legislation. 210,806 hectares\u000d\u000a      (approximately 57%) of England's common land is in Sites of Special\u000d\u000a      Scientific Interest (SSSIs).The poor condition of protected habitats on\u000d\u000a      common land is a major problem for the implementation of public policy. In\u000d\u000a      2003, 67% of the common land in English SSSIs was in unfavourable\u000d\u000a      conservation condition; in 2008 Natural England reported only 19% as in\u000d\u000a      favourable conservation condition, with a further 48% of common land in\u000d\u000a      English SSSIs in unfavourable but recovering condition.\u000d\u000a    Research\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research highlighted the need to understand and\u000d\u000a      accommodate complex common property rights if strategies to improve the\u000d\u000a      environmental management of common land are to be successful. The research\u000d\u000a      examined the past, present and future governance of common land by placing\u000d\u000a      the development of common property rights, governance principles and\u000d\u000a      governance mechanisms in historical perspective. Furthermore, it\u000d\u000a      challenged the assumptions of institutional literature on common pool\u000d\u000a      resource governance using fieldwork and archival data focussed on four\u000d\u000a      project case studies.\u000d\u000a    Key insights leading to the impacts described in section 4 below were:\u000d\u000a      (i) Common land is subject to more complex property rights than other\u000d\u000a      land; and common property rights differ significantly in different\u000d\u000a      localities; (ii) Common property rights have changed and developed over\u000d\u000a      time, and customary practices continue to have relevance to their\u000d\u000a      definition, scope and exercise; (iii) Statutory Measures for the\u000d\u000a      registration and management of common land (e.g. the Commons Act 2006)\u000d\u000a      fail to recognise the complexity and mutability of common rights, and the\u000d\u000a      importance of locally mediated social practice in developing strategies\u000d\u000a      for improving the management of common land; and (iv) Public Policy for\u000d\u000a      the sustainable management of common land must recognise and accommodate\u000d\u000a      common property rights when developing new models for the communal\u000d\u000a      management of land. Unless this is done it will be difficult to implement\u000d\u000a      public policy effectively and to improve the environmental quality of\u000d\u000a      common land.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research was conducted during two AHRC-funded projects:\u000d\u000a      (i) research grant `Contested Common Land &#8212; Environmental Governance, Law\u000d\u000a      and Sustainable Land Management 1600-2010' (2007-2010); and (ii) Follow-on\u000d\u000a      funding for `Building Commons Knowledge' (2012-2013). The major grant\u000d\u000a      project carried out fieldwork in four case study areas in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales in 2008-2010: Eskdale (Cumbria), Ingleborough (North Yorkshire), the\u000d\u000a      Elan Valley (Powys) and the North Norfolk Grazing Marshes (Brancaster,\u000d\u000a      Norfolk). Contemporary governance issues were examined through qualitative\u000d\u000a      data generation and analysis, focus groups with stakeholders in each case\u000d\u000a      study and doctrinal research on the interaction of governance instruments\u000d\u000a      and property rights. The research outcomes are published in (1), (2),\u000d\u000a      (3) and (4).\u000d\u000a    The research website (4) is a permanent free access research\u000d\u000a      resource, containing extensive information for stakeholder groups, common\u000d\u000a      appropriators\/community groups.

Dissemination of the study's findings led\u000d\u000a      to invitations to discuss its implications with the Number 10 Policy Unit\u000d\u000a      (July 2010, leading to its circulation within government), and with the\u000d\u000a      (then) Commissioning and Commercial Director for the National Offender\u000d\u000a      Management Service (NOMS) (March, August 2009). The research has\u000d\u000a      influenced the development of NOMS' understanding of correctional practice\u000d\u000a      and, in so doing, directly affected the content of the Offender Engagement\u000d\u000a      Programme of NOMS, particularly within the Skills for Effective Engagement\u000d\u000a      and Development (SEED) year-long training programme for current probation\u000d\u000a      staff, which was rolled out nationally in 2012 [S1]. SEED is currently\u000d\u000a      being evaluated by the University of Sheffield, with funding by NOMS,\u000d\u000a      under the direction of Professor Shapland. The SEED programme is now a\u000d\u000a      major workpackage in an EU grant (coordinated by NOMS) to explore\u000d\u000a      implementation and evaluation in other European countries, in this\u000d\u000a      instance, Romania (grant JUST\/2011\/JPEN\/AG\/2892, 2012-2014). In\u000d\u000a      contributing to increased understanding of how and why people stop\u000d\u000a      offending, the research has helped NOMS re-orientate its thinking about\u000d\u000a      how its frontline practice needs to be commissioned and delivered [S1].\u000d\u000a    The research has played a key role in shaping the training of probation\u000d\u000a      staff [S2, S6, S7]. During this period there were three providers of\u000d\u000a      training for future probation staff (Portsmouth, De Montfort and Sheffield\u000d\u000a      Hallam Universities). All were required by NOMS to teach trainee staff\u000d\u000a      about the research on desistance from crime as part of their studies, and\u000d\u000a      to encourage staff to remain aware of the main messages of this research\u000d\u000a      during their time as probation workers. Key messages drawn from the\u000d\u000a      desistance research undertaken at Sheffield University were taught to\u000d\u000a      trainee probation staff by these consortia [S7]. For example, the\u000d\u000a      Sheffield Hallam module \"Positive Probation Practice\" (part of the\u000d\u000a      Probation Qualifying Framework: Level 6) drew heavily on the material\u000d\u000a      produced by members of staff at Sheffield University [S7]. Both de\u000d\u000a      Montfort and Sheffield Hallam universities have web links to the\u000d\u000a      University of Sheffield's `Discovering Desistance' blog [S7].\u000d\u000a    (2) The film has increased understanding of desistance among\u000d\u000a        practitioners and policy-makers\u000d\u000a      The Road from Crime ([R4] above) uses interviews with current and\u000d\u000a      former service users, probation staff and academic experts in the UK and\u000d\u000a      the USA to highlight how the process of desistance unfolds and how the\u000d\u000a      criminal justice system could be moulded to assist these processes [S3].\u000d\u000a      Film screenings and discussions among practitioners have led to increased\u000d\u000a      understanding on the part of probation staff (at all levels) concerning\u000d\u000a      the supervision and assessment of offenders, and resulted in revised\u000d\u000a      training programmes emphasising the benefits of making assessments of\u000d\u000a      offenders' needs which allow for the identification of the positive\u000d\u000a      aspects of an individual's life [S2]. The Project Advisory Group for the\u000d\u000a      film included representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government, the Probation Board for Northern Ireland, those training\u000d\u000a      probation staff, and former service users. The film was shown at eight\u000d\u000a      seminars throughout the UK (between April and June 2012) funded by the\u000d\u000a      ESRC, and at numerous events since. These raised awareness and provoked\u000d\u000a      discussions between policy makers, service providers (state, private and\u000d\u000a      voluntary sector), service users, and their families about how current\u000d\u000a      service provisions could be re-orientated to better facilitate desistance\u000d\u000a      [S2 and S7]. The film has also been packaged as a DVD (translated into\u000d\u000a      French, Spanish, German and Finnish) and made freely available via the web\u000d\u000a      [R4], [R5]. A copy of the DVD was given free to every delegate at the\u000d\u000a      Probation Chief's Association (PCA) conference in March 2013, with the PCA\u000d\u000a      funding the 200 DVDs this required.\u000d\u000a    The film and the web-page have started a wider debate amongst\u000d\u000a      practitioners about how formal institutions can help people to stop\u000d\u000a      offending [S4]. Examples of the use of the film include screenings to\u000d\u000a      people being supervised in the community (to encourage thinking about an\u000d\u000a      individual's past offending), to mentors (to further their understanding\u000d\u000a      of the lives of those with whom they will be working), and to staff in\u000d\u000a      other branches of the criminal justice system, such as the police and\u000d\u000a      magistrates (to make them aware of processes of desistance). The web-page\u000d\u000a      has also become a forum for debate amongst policy makers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners. It has had over 61,788 visits (`hits') by 32,414 unique\u000d\u000a      visitors between 18\/08\/2011 and 31\/7\/2013. The film is playing a major\u000d\u000a      role in increasing understanding of desistance by professionals and policy\u000d\u000a      makers, and has helped combat common misperceptions of offending behaviour\u000d\u000a      [S2]. A screening of the film in July 2012 in Glasgow was attended by\u000d\u000a      around 200 people, including the Scottish Justice Secretary (Kenny\u000d\u000a      MacAskill MSP), who praised the film: \"This has helped my officials and me\u000d\u000a      in better understanding the reality of desistance from crime, and in\u000d\u000a      considering how public policy can better remove obstacles to desistance\"\u000d\u000a      [S5]. Key showings of the film include that to the Scottish Parliament in\u000d\u000a      February 2013. Farrall was invited by the French Minister of Justice\u000d\u000a      (Christiane Taubira) to speak about desistance to a specially convened\u000d\u000a      citizens' jury in February 2013. The film has been added to the Home\u000d\u000a      Affairs Section, House of Commons Library, the Librarian having commented:\u000d\u000a      `This could be very useful as a source &#8212; just the sort of thing that\u000d\u000a      Members [of Parliament] would be interested in seeing'. The film is free\u000d\u000a      to view from the web-page above, and has been played online or downloaded\u000d\u000a      4,930 times between 18\/08\/2011 and 31\/7\/2013. The briefing paper [R6] has\u000d\u000a      been downloaded 1,066 times and read online 5,881 times between 18\/08\/2011\u000d\u000a      and 31\/7\/2013. Because the film is free to view on the web, it is not\u000d\u000a      possible to document all instances when it has been seen. The film has\u000d\u000a      been accessed in Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, South America and North\u000d\u000a      America.

This funding enabled the conduct\u000d\u000a      of two longitudinal research projects:\u000d\u000a    1) The `Young Adult Desistance Study' was funded by an ESRC network grant\u000d\u000a      between 2002 and 2008, and by a subsequent Leverhulme Emeritus Fellowship\u000d\u000a      for Professor Bottoms. Researchers involved were Professor Joanna\u000d\u000a        Shapland and Professor A.E. Bottoms (co-directors, 2002-),\u000d\u000a      Dr Andrew Costello (2002-), Dr Deidre Healy (2006-8), Deborah\u000a        Holmes (2004-6), Dr Grant Muir (2002-8) and Dr Angela\u000d\u000a        Sorsby (2008-). The research involved repeat interviews with 113 men\u000d\u000a      living in South Yorkshire over a four year period, as well as analysing\u000d\u000a      official conviction data and probation records. It investigated the early\u000d\u000a      stages of desistance from crime, resulting in an increased evidence base\u000d\u000a      in relation to pathways in and out of crime, highlighting the interactions\u000d\u000a      between individuals, their immediate social surroundings and wider social\u000d\u000a      and economic contexts [R1]. This research has assisted in the development\u000d\u000a      of probation practice and improved public policies aimed at reducing\u000d\u000a      criminality and enhancing individuals' life chances. The ESRC evaluation\u000d\u000a      of the study and of the network stated: `The longitudinal research\u000d\u000a      projects [including the Young Adult Desistance Study] were the major focus\u000d\u000a      of the network and were overwhelmingly successful. They were unique in the\u000d\u000a      scope and quality of data collected (childhood, adolescence, young\u000d\u000a      adulthood), the methodological sophistication shown, and their strong\u000d\u000a      theoretical underpinnings.'\u000d\u000a    2) `Tracking Progress on Probation' began in 1997 when Professor Stephen\u000a        Farrall (PI) worked at Oxford University (1996-2000), continuing on\u000d\u000a      his re-location to Keele (2000-2007) and to Sheffield in 2007. Others\u000d\u000a      working on the project were Dr Gilly Sharpe (2010-) and Dr Ben\u000d\u000a        Hunter (2010-12). The research has charted the impact of probation\u000d\u000a      supervision on the lives and criminal careers of 199 men and women. The\u000d\u000a      fourth and fifth sweeps of interviews (in 2003-04 and 2010-12\u000d\u000a      respectively, funded by the Leverhulme Trust) traced and re-interviewed\u000d\u000a      116 sample members [R2]. The bulk of the fieldwork was conducted after\u000d\u000a      2007 when Farrall moved to Sheffield. This study is unique globally in\u000d\u000a      following so intensively, and for such a long period, a group of people\u000d\u000a      who have been sentenced to probation. The main finding is that probation\u000d\u000a      supervision can aid desistance, but that this result is only achieved\u000d\u000a      after a period of several years.\u000d\u000a    Both studies found major areas where improvements in probation\u000d\u000a      supervision could be made [R1] [R2]. This included, for example, focusing\u000d\u000a      on probationers' strengths rather than their deficiencies. The main policy\u000d\u000a      message was that probation supervision needed to become\u000d\u000a      `desistance-focused', rather than `offending-related' [R3]. This message\u000d\u000a      has been developed by those working in practice in several ways ([S1],\u000d\u000a      [S2], [S4], [S6] and [S7] below), but particularly since an ESRC-funded\u000d\u000a      Knowledge Exchange Grant in 2011-12.\u000d\u000a    Engaging practitioners\u000d\u000a    The ESRC Knowledge Exchange Grant (awarded to Farrall, Professor\u000d\u000a      Fergus McNeill (PI, University of Glasgow) and Professor Shadd Maruna\u000d\u000a      (Queen's University Belfast: RES 189250258) led to the making of a film\u000d\u000a      [R4] about why people stop offending, and what can be done to assist these\u000d\u000a      efforts.

The report explored\u000a      the current jurisdiction of the Gibraltar Ombudsman and the limitations on\u000a      its capacity to operate to\u000a      its full potential. It made a number of recommendations, focusing in\u000a      particular on corporate\u000a      governance and on the need to enhance the interconnection between this\u000a      office and Parliament.\u000a    The combined impact of Kirkham's research includes:\u000a    (i) Changing approaches within Ombudsman schemes and informing best\u000a        practice\u000a    \u000a       Ombudsman schemes have changed their strategy and policies as a\u000a        result of Kirkham's\u000a        work. The UK Parliamentary Ombudsman has followed Kirkham's lead in\u000a        seeking\u000a        enhanced engagement with Parliament, a point accepted by the\u000a        Parliamentary Public\u000a        Administration Select Committee (PASC) when it examined Kirkham's report\u000a        [S1] (Q.39-\u000a        41). The Gibraltar Ombudsman's stated intention is to use Kirkham's\u000a        evaluation as the\u000a        basis for reform of the office, concluding that \"without doubt, this\u000a        report will mark a `before\u000a        and after' for the Ombudsman in Gibraltar\" [S2]. The Local Government\u000a        Ombudsman\u000a        (LGO) has accepted almost all the recommendations of Kirkham et al's\u000a        evaluation as\u000a        confirmed in the minutes of its governing body, LGO Commission [S3],\u000a        including proposals\u000a        on independence and the restructuring of its corporate governance and\u000a        quality control\u000a        regime.\u000a       The Parliamentary Ombudsman has placed Kirkham's consultation\u000a        response at the heart of\u000a        her efforts to obtain a legislative amendment to remove the MP filter\u000a        (which denies citizens\u000a        the right to bring a complaint directly to her) from the current scheme\u000a        [S4] (p 23).\u000a       Practitioner debate on best practice within the Ombudsman community\u000a        has been regularly\u000a        informed by Kirkham's research, with his work often directly cited by\u000a        Ombudsmen [S5]. A\u000a        direct contribution to debate has been achieved through regular\u000a        invitations to speak at the\u000a        leading forums for senior practitioners, including the British and Irish\u000a        Ombudsman\u000a        Association (renamed the Ombudsman Association) in 2009, the Caribbean\u000a        Ombudsman\u000a        Association in 2008, and the International Ombudsman Institute (IOI) in\u000a        2012. The Chair of\u000a        the IOI recently described Kirkham's presentation to its global\u000a        quadrennial gathering as a\u000a        `stimulating opening to the Conference' [S6].\u000a       Kirkham's argument that the Ombudsman should be considered as part of\u000a        the integrity\u000a        branch of the constitution [R2] [R3] has been taken up by several\u000a        Ombudsmen in their\u000a        writing, speeches and Parliamentary submissions [S5]. Kirkham's recent\u000a        promotion of an\u000a        own-initiative power of investigation for the Ombudsman has also been\u000a        largely accepted by\u000a        the British Ombudsman community [S5].\u000a    \u000a    (ii) Influencing Governments' decision-making\u000a    \u000a       Kirkham's Gibraltar evaluation has been presented to the Gibraltar\u000a        Chief Minister and\u000a        separately to senior figures in the Gibraltar Government, with a view to\u000a        introducing\u000a        legislative reform [S2]. Kirkham's proposals are to: (1) amend the\u000a        Ombudsman statute; (2)\u000a        expand the office's jurisdiction; (3) reform the Ombudsman's legal\u000a        powers; and (4) clarify\u000a        key details of the relationship between the Ombudsman and the Government\u000a        in Gibraltar.\u000a       Kirkham's LGO evaluation was submitted to both the Department for\u000a        Communities and\u000a        Local Government (DCLG) and the CLG Parliamentary Select Committee for\u000a        their\u000a        consideration and response [S3]. Following the evaluation, the DCLG is\u000a        conducting its own\u000a        internal review, and the CLG is undertaking a Parliamentary inquiry in\u000a        Autumn 2013. The\u000a        evaluation includes the recommendation that the Government should grant\u000a        greater\u000a        autonomy to the LGO, and introduce amendments to legislation to\u000a        facilitate enhanced\u000a        independence and accountability.\u000a    \u000a    (iii) Forming opinions within Parliament\u000a    \u000a       Kirkham's work with Buck and Thompson specifically recommended merger\u000a        and reform of\u000a        Ombudsman schemes in Northern Ireland [R2]. The need for legislative\u000a        reform of the\u000a        Northern Ireland Ombudsman has been accepted by the Committee of the\u000a        Northern Ireland\u000a        Assembly, citing their work [S7], with the Assembly taking the decision\u000a        to introduce\u000a        legislation.\u000a       Kirkham was a member of a team of academics who submitted evidence to\u000a        the\u000a        Parliamentary Justice Committee arguing that the Administrative Justice\u000a        and Tribunals\u000a        Council (AJTC) should not be abolished, as per Government proposals.\u000a        This work repeated\u000a        the claims in favour of the AJTC made elsewhere in Kirkham's research\u000a        [R2] [R6]. Citing\u000a        the team's submission regularly, the Justice Committee produced a report\u000a        (2012-13 (HC\u000a        965)) in favour of preservation of the AJTC, which led the Chair of the\u000a        AJTC to thank\u000a        personally members of the academic team. \"Your combined submission was\u000a        one of the\u000a        most powerful the Committee received and clearly made an impact upon\u000a        them\" [S8].\u000a    \u000a    (iv) Shaping the debate at the policy-making level\u000a    \u000a       Kirkham's research has shaped the policy and recommendations of the\u000a        Law Commission in\u000a        its review of remedies in Public Law, as published in a series of Law\u000a        Commission reports\u000a        [S9]. Influenced by Kirkham's work and his responses to its consultation\u000a        process, the Law\u000a        Commission was persuaded to include Ombudsman reform at the heart of its\u000a        study of\u000a        administrative law remedies. With the bulk of the Law Commission's work\u000a        on remedies\u000a        failing to attract support, later reports of the Law Commission were\u000a        redirected specifically\u000a        on the Ombudsman, again partially in response to the arguments made in\u000a        Kirkham's\u000a        research and thereafter submitted to the Commission.\u000a       Many of Kirkham's recommendations were adopted by the Commission.\u000a        Specifically these\u000a        include (1) the removal of the statutory bar which prevents the\u000a        Ombudsman accepting\u000a        complaints that could otherwise go to court, and (2) the transfer of\u000a        complaints from the\u000a        Ombudsman to the courts and vice versa. The influence of the research on\u000a        the Law\u000a        Commission's thinking on Ombudsman reform is evidenced by citations in\u000a        their papers\u000a        between 2008 and 2011 [S9].\u000a       In its final report, the Law Commission accepted the conclusions of\u000a        Kirkham's research with\u000a        Buck and Thompson [R2] [R6] in recommending that a wholesale review of\u000a        the overall AJ\u000a        system, and in particular of the public service Ombudsmen network, was\u000a        necessary in\u000a        order to address the ad hoc nature of its evolution and current\u000a        incoherence [S9]. Kirkham\u000a        was invited in June 2012 to lecture at a special conference of the AJTC\u000a        on this issue [S10].\u000a        The conference was attended by over 50 people from public sector\u000a        organisations,\u000a        government, lawyers and voluntary associations affected by\u000a        administrative justice. The idea\u000a        of a review of the public service Ombudsmen network is currently being\u000a        pursued by the\u000a        Parliamentary Ombudsman [S5].\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Sheffield research on the role of Ombudsmen within the Administrative\u000a      Justice (AJ) system has:\u000a      (1) changed the approaches of Parliamentary and Local Government Ombudsmen\u000a      in the UK with a\u000a      view to improving their performance; (2) influenced government decision\u000a      making on the reform of\u000a      Ombudsman schemes in the UK and in Gibraltar; (3) contributed to forming\u000a      opinions among\u000a      parliamentary decision makers, via the Parliamentary Select Committee\u000a      system; and (4) shaped\u000a      debate and policy recommendations on administrative justice remedies\u000a      within the Law\u000a      Commission.

The focus of the research is on understanding and enhancing the\u000a      capacity of the office of\u000a      the Ombudsman to promote good administrative practice and deliver justice\u000a      to individuals for the\u000a      redress of grievances. The research builds upon a tradition of socio-legal\u000a      research on public law\u000a      and AJ undertaken in the School of Law since the 1980s led by Professors\u000a      Douglas Lewis and Ian\u000a      Harden, and work by Rhoda James and Mary Seneviratne specifically on\u000a      Ombudsmen. Kirkham's\u000a      early work (2003-06) identified innovatory trends and unfulfilled\u000a      potential in the operation of\u000a      Ombudsman schemes in the UK [R1]. In 2006, Kirkham and two colleagues from\u000a      other universities\u000a      (Buck and Thompson) delivered an ESRC-funded project which explored\u000a      Ombudsman schemes\u000a      around the world in the context of the operation of the wider AJ system\u000a      (2006-10). Kirkham was\u000a      principal author of most of the main outputs, including [R2] [R4] [R5]\u000a      [R6].

Throughout the world\u000a        there has been innovation both in the uses to which the office has been\u000a        put, and in the\u000a        methods applied by Ombudsmen in implementing their tasks.

In addition, the evaluation of\u000d\u000a      the JRC scheme was the\u000d\u000a      first major study of a randomised controlled trial in criminology in the\u000d\u000a      UK.\u000d\u000a    The research found:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      A majority of victims chose to participate in face-to-face meetings\u000d\u000a        with the offender when\u000d\u000a        offered by a trained facilitator;\u000d\u000a      Over 80% of victims who took part were satisfied with the process and\u000d\u000a        outcome;\u000d\u000a      Victims who took part were more satisfied with the criminal justice\u000d\u000a        response than those who\u000d\u000a        did not;\u000d\u000a      Victims of more serious offences found it particularly helpful;\u000d\u000a      Taking part in RJ conferencing reduced the frequency of re-offending;\u000d\u000a      RJ conferencing was value for money, in that the savings in terms of\u000d\u000a        reduced re-offending\u000d\u000a        were considerably more than the cost of running the schemes (&#163;9 savings\u000d\u000a        for every &#163;1\u000d\u000a        spent).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The evaluation was conducted in four stages, each resulting in the\u000d\u000a      publication of a separate report\u000d\u000a      which fed back results to the schemes and informed on-going policy\u000d\u000a      development. The first stage\u000d\u000a      (2001-2003) involved following the schemes as they were set up, including\u000d\u000a      interviews with referring\u000d\u000a      agencies and scheme personnel [R1]; the second stage covered the main\u000d\u000a      operation of the\u000d\u000a      schemes (2002-2004), including observation of RJ meetings and final\u000d\u000a      interviews with referring\u000d\u000a      agencies and scheme personnel [R2]; stage three (2002-2005) involved\u000d\u000a      interviews with victims and\u000d\u000a      offenders [R3]; the final stage (2006-2008) examined re-offending over the\u000d\u000a      next two years, taking\u000d\u000a      account of costs of reoffending (in collaboration with the Economics Unit\u000d\u000a      in the Home Office to\u000d\u000a      develop new methods of measuring costs and undertaking cost-benefit\u000d\u000a      analysis) [R4]. The\u000d\u000a      conclusions and implications of the research were set out and further\u000d\u000a      explored in a journal article\u000d\u000a      [R5] and book [R6]. Professor Shapland was awarded the Outstanding\u000d\u000a      Achievement award of the\u000d\u000a      British Society of Criminology 2013 principally for this research.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23011","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research undertaken by Professor Francis over the last 11 years has\u000d\u000a      generated impact in\u000d\u000a      shaping professional debate and contributing to changes in policy and\u000d\u000a      practice. This has resulted\u000d\u000a      in direct changes to the ways in which professional associations intervene\u000d\u000a      in social mobility issues\u000d\u000a      through setting up their own Work Experience schemes in an attempt to\u000d\u000a      address the issues raised\u000d\u000a      by Francis &#8212; in particular Inner Temple's Pegasus Access Scheme.\u000d\u000a      It has fed directly into the\u000d\u000a      formation of key recommendations within the Legal Education and\u000d\u000a        Training Review (LETR),\u000d\u000a      and has changed the outreach practices of a national Widening\u000d\u000a        Participation initiative. The legal\u000d\u000a      profession and its regulators now take social-economic background\u000d\u000a      seriously as a potential barrier\u000d\u000a      to the legal profession. Moreover, Social Mobility and Access to the Legal\u000d\u000a      Professions is now a\u000d\u000a      central concern of the UK Government, policy-makers and legal regulators\u000d\u000a      (source 1).\u000d\u000a    The research demonstrates the differential way in which students can\u000d\u000a      secure access to legal work\u000d\u000a      experience and the importance of an early and frequent engagement with\u000d\u000a      these groups prior to\u000d\u000a      University. A number of policy changes and schemes have been established\u000d\u000a      to address these\u000d\u000a      gaps, most prominently, Inner Temple's Pegasus Access Scheme. In\u000d\u000a      June 2010, Francis (and\u000d\u000a      his collaborator, Professor Sommerlad) organised a workshop to showcase\u000d\u000a      the Legal Work\u000d\u000a      Experience project findings with support of the Legal Service Board at its\u000d\u000a      London offices. This\u000d\u000a      workshop was attended by leading regulators and policy-makers, including\u000d\u000a      Magic Circle Law firms,\u000d\u000a      Inns of Court and representatives from the Bar Council, Law Society and\u000d\u000a      the Institute of Paralegals\u000d\u000a      (source 2). Francis was invited to apply to the prestigious Inner Temple\u000d\u000a      Academic Fellow\u000d\u000a      programme, designed to enhance dialogue between the profession and\u000d\u000a      academics. He was\u000d\u000a      appointed as one of the first five Academic Fellows in November 2010,\u000d\u000a      predominantly because his\u000d\u000a      research on social mobility was of utmost interest to Inner Temple. As\u000d\u000a      part of this Fellowship he\u000d\u000a      was invited to provide a keynote address at an Inner Temple conference in\u000d\u000a      February 2011 (source\u000d\u000a      3), which generated further media and policy engagement with his research\u000d\u000a      on legal executives,\u000d\u000a      part-time law students and legal work experience (source 4). The findings\u000d\u000a      on legal executives saw\u000d\u000a      a follow-up piece based on the research published in the trade press. This\u000d\u000a      piece included a\u000d\u000a      response from the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEX) and\u000d\u000a      generated 57 online\u000d\u000a      comments (source 5).\u000d\u000a    Francis' involvement with Inner Temple has enabled leading Law firms and\u000d\u000a      barristers' chambers to\u000d\u000a      respond to the findings highlighted in Francis' research by establishing\u000d\u000a      new social mobility and\u000d\u000a      access schemes, in particular, Inner Temple's Pegasus Access Scheme. Inner\u000d\u000a      Temple testify to\u000d\u000a      the impact of Francis' research on the Pegasus Scheme, stating that his\u000d\u000a      work informed the way in\u000d\u000a      which the scheme was formulated (source 6). It was launched in 2012, and\u000d\u000a      led to work experience\u000d\u000a      opportunities for 50 students in its first year. The success of the first\u000d\u000a      year has resulted in a larger\u000d\u000a      intake in 2013. Keele University links with Inner Temple have been further\u000d\u000a      strengthened through a\u000d\u000a      PhD studentship, jointly funded by Inner Temple and Keele University, to\u000d\u000a      evaluate the success of\u000d\u000a      the Pegasus scheme. Middle Temple has now launched a similar scheme to run\u000d\u000a      from 2013. The\u000d\u000a      research findings were kept at the forefront of policy and professional\u000d\u000a      debate, through citation in a\u000d\u000a      number of Legal Service Board publications (source 7, source 8) and\u000d\u000a      through speaking to the\u000d\u000a      profession at events at Inner Temple. A number of leading firms have now\u000d\u000a      also established\u000d\u000a      prominent social mobility schemes, for example, Allen &amp; Overy,\u000d\u000a      Clifford Chance, and Freshfields\u000d\u000a      (source 9).\u000d\u000a    The second major impact has been the transformation of the Aim\u000d\u000a          Higher &#8212; Access to the\u000d\u000a          Professions (A2P) scheme. This is hosted by Keele but has a\u000d\u000a      national reach to learners\u000d\u000a      throughout the UK. Francis worked with A2P to ensure that his research\u000d\u000a      finding about the\u000d\u000a      importance of regular and early contact with the profession can be\u000d\u000a      achieved, and has ensured that\u000d\u000a      his key research findings about `what the recruiters are looking for' are\u000d\u000a      directly communicated to\u000d\u000a      learners from non-traditional backgrounds. During 2012\/13, for example, 66\u000d\u000a      learners have been\u000d\u000a      supported by the A2P programme, with all participating feeling more\u000d\u000a      confident about their career\u000d\u000a      plans as a result of the programme. Francis has drawn on the lessons from\u000d\u000a      the Inner Temple\u000d\u000a      access scheme, through the connections established by his research, to\u000d\u000a      enhance mentoring\u000d\u000a      practices within the network by putting in place new mentoring protocols\u000d\u000a      for A2P.\u000d\u000a    Finally the recommendations of the LETR have drawn directly on\u000d\u000a      the research findings of\u000d\u000a      Francis in its final report and earlier publications. LETR draws\u000d\u000a      explicitly on the conclusion\/insight\u000d\u000a      that work experience represents a key (and differentially experienced)\u000d\u000a      barrier to entry into the\u000d\u000a      profession (source 10: p. 11; source 11: pp. 13-14). In particular, the\u000d\u000a      report recommends that\u000d\u000a      informal work experience should be subject to the same equality monitoring\u000d\u000a      and selection\u000d\u000a      processes as Formal Vacation Schemes. It recommends professional standards\u000d\u000a      for internships\u000d\u000a      and work experience, as well as a central clearing house for work\u000d\u000a      experience (source 12: Rec. 20\u000d\u000a      &amp; 25) to address concerns expressed in the research about knowledge,\u000d\u000a      awareness and the basis\u000d\u000a      upon which applicants secure informal work experience (source 12: paras\u000d\u000a      6.32, 6.44). This drew\u000d\u000a      on Francis (2011), which highlighted the importance of providing students,\u000d\u000a      particularly from non-traditional\u000d\u000a      backgrounds, with early access and information (source 12: para 6.146).\u000d\u000a    A key recommendation of the LETR, developed through the Discussion Paper\u000d\u000a      on social mobility is\u000d\u000a      that there should be greater diversity of and support for non-graduates\u000d\u000a      and a wider range of entry\u000d\u000a      points into the legal profession (source 12). At the same time the LETR\u000d\u000a      has acknowledged,\u000d\u000a      drawing on Francis's research, that notwithstanding alternative routes of\u000d\u000a      entry, non-traditional\u000d\u000a      aspirants to entry in the profession may still experience disadvantage\u000d\u000a      (source 10: p. 16 in relation\u000d\u000a      to part-timers (including issues of age &#8212; source 11: p. 9) and source 10:\u000d\u000a      pp. 22-3; source 11: pp.\u000d\u000a      27-8 in relation to legal executives). Francis' work on part-time law\u000d\u000a      students maintained a\u000d\u000a      significant profile in advance of its use in the LETR, through a follow-up\u000d\u000a      article in the professional\u000d\u000a      press, attracting 8 comments (source 13).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case-study is based on research conducted by Professor Francis at\u000d\u000a      Keele University which\u000d\u000a      provides insights into three crucial aspects of social mobility and access\u000d\u000a      to the legal professions:\u000d\u000a      legal executives, part-time law students, and legal work experience.

This covers three areas; legal executives (particularly\u000d\u000a      the experience of women), part-time\u000d\u000a        law students, and access to legal work experience. It was\u000d\u000a      conducted between 2000 and\u000d\u000a      2011 at Keele University where Francis has been Lecturer and Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer, and is now\u000d\u000a      Professor.\u000d\u000a    Although the legal executive qualification has secured an\u000d\u000a      increasing number of formal rights and\u000d\u000a      responsibilities, the research highlighted the ways in which many legal\u000d\u000a      executives (particularly\u000d\u000a      women), experience disadvantage in terms of professional status, pay and\u000d\u000a      so on. Further, it\u000d\u000a      argued that closer attention needs to be paid to individual experiences\u000d\u000a      rather than the rhetoric of a\u000d\u000a      professional association. The research insights were first published in\u000d\u000a      the 2002 International\u000d\u000a        Journal of the Legal Profession article, addressing profession-wide\u000d\u000a      issues, the 2006 Social &amp; Legal\u000d\u000a        Studies article focussed explicitly on women and further discussion,\u000d\u000a      including recent\u000d\u000a      developments, was presented in Chapter 4 of the 2011 book At the Edge\u000d\u000a        of Law. This work also\u000d\u000a      assisted in drawing much greater academic attention to legal executives,\u000d\u000a      including by Boon,\u000d\u000a      Rackley, Turbine and Westaby.\u000d\u000a    The research project on part-time law students (with Iain\u000d\u000a      McDonald of the University of the West\u000d\u000a      of England) represented the first academic analysis of this previously\u000d\u000a      forgotten cohort within legal\u000d\u000a      education. Professor Francis was principal investigator of this project\u000d\u000a      and lead author on all\u000d\u000a      publications. The key findings highlighted in the 2009 Journal of Law\u000d\u000a        and Society article\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that both the experience and outcome of part-time legal\u000d\u000a      education is considerably\u000d\u000a      `less than' those undertaking full-time legal education. The research drew\u000d\u000a      particular attention to a\u000d\u000a      number of multiple disadvantages which hinder opportunities in terms of\u000d\u000a      access to the legal\u000d\u000a      profession. Fundamentally, the research argued that such access routes\u000d\u000a      will often be undermined\u000d\u000a      by complicating factors and assumptions about merit.\u000d\u000a    These themes were further explored in the Access to Legal Work\u000d\u000a        Experience Project (2007-2011)\u000d\u000a      (with Professor Hilary Sommerlad, then of the University of Leicester).\u000d\u000a      Professor Francis\u000d\u000a      was principal investigator and originator of the project. Engagement with\u000d\u000a      the profession was built\u000d\u000a      into the project at its outset; Professor Francis secured the agreement of\u000d\u000a      the Law Society to\u000d\u000a      support the project through delivery of a number of research questions\u000d\u000a      through its annual\u000d\u000a      membership survey. This project drew on empirical research with students\u000d\u000a      and law firms, to\u000d\u000a      explore the role that work experience plays in mediating access to the\u000d\u000a      legal profession. It\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that although Formal Vacation Schemes are run according to\u000d\u000a      objective criteria, a key\u000d\u000a      factor in securing access to these schemes are criteria such as HEI\u000d\u000a      attended, A-levels secured\u000d\u000a      and informal work experience. The project demonstrated that prior\u000d\u000a      educational history and family\u000d\u000a      circumstances heavily structured students' ability to meet these\u000d\u000a      requirements. Moreover, the\u000d\u000a      processes of the formal schemes themselves required an understanding of\u000d\u000a      law firm culture that\u000d\u000a      those with greater exposure to the profession were better able to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate. This research was\u000d\u000a      set out in the 2009 International Journal of the Legal Profession\u000d\u000a      article and Chap.3 of At the Edge\u000d\u000a        of Law.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23129","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Adoption of sentencing guidelines\u000d\u000a    Based on his underlying research that identified the need for and most\u000d\u000a      effective form of sentencing guidelines, Wasik was appointed as the first\u000d\u000a      Chair of the Sentencing Advisory Panel (`the Panel'), advising first the\u000d\u000a      Court of Appeal, and then, from 2007, the Sentencing Guidelines Council.\u000d\u000a      The Panel's work involved quantitative analysis of sentencing statistics,\u000d\u000a      assessment of critical academic writing, wide consultation with interested\u000d\u000a      organisations and individuals, including victims of crime and the general\u000d\u000a      public. It was recognised as high-quality, thoroughly researched work, but\u000d\u000a      directly applicable to practice. The Panel also commissioned independent\u000d\u000a      empirical research into public attitudes to sentencing. Lord Chief Justice\u000d\u000a      Woolf said: `The advice of the Panel under Martin Wasik's authoritative\u000d\u000a      chairmanship is always thoroughly researched, carefully considered, and of\u000d\u000a      the highest quality' (source 1). In their text Easton and Piper refer to\u000d\u000a      the `value of the reasoned and researched advice given by the SAP\u000d\u000a      [Sentencing Advisory Panel]' (source 2). The advice from the Panel on the\u000d\u000a      basis of this research was adopted and their guidelines have been issued\u000d\u000a      on 11 occasions by the Court of Appeal and on 12 occasions by the\u000d\u000a      Sentencing Guidelines Council.\u000d\u000a    Some guidelines set out general principles, based on proportionality.\u000d\u000a      These include guidelines on offence seriousness, sentencing of young\u000d\u000a      offenders, and allocation of offences. Others provide clear and detailed\u000d\u000a      advice for judges dealing with difficult and emotive areas, such as\u000d\u000a      sentencing for rape, burglary, driving offences causing death, child abuse\u000d\u000a      offences, fraud, handling stolen goods, minimum terms in murder, and the\u000d\u000a      reduction in sentence for a guilty plea. This last guideline is `the\u000d\u000a      reference point' for judges dealing with the 90 per cent of defendants who\u000d\u000a      plead guilty (source 3). This guideline has been referred to in appellate\u000d\u000a      cases on 445 occasions in 2013 alone. The guideline on domestic violence\u000d\u000a      was strongly endorsed by Hallett LJ: `Investigators, prosecutors,\u000d\u000a      defenders and judges should read and re-read the guideline, and ensure\u000d\u000a      they are truly aware of its implications' (source 4). Early guidelines\u000d\u000a      developed by the Panel, such as those on handling stolen goods in Webbe\u000d\u000a      [2001] EWCA Crim 1217, remain the standard for any judge or magistrate\u000d\u000a      sentencing for that offence. This guideline has been followed and endorsed\u000d\u000a      by the Court of Appeal in 129 cases (63 since 2008). Many changes to\u000d\u000a      sentencing practice have resulted from the Panel's advice and the\u000d\u000a      resulting guidelines, including the principle that the starting point in\u000d\u000a      sentencing for rape should be the same in `stranger rape' and\u000d\u000a      `acquaintance rape' cases (source 5), and the adoption of a scale of\u000d\u000a      seriousness within child abuse images as a means of achieving consistent\u000d\u000a      sentencing for the offense of downloading child abuse images from the\u000d\u000a      internet (source 6). The Lord Chief Justice had previously sought the\u000d\u000a      views of the Panel in relation to issuing guidelines for this offence and\u000d\u000a      substantially adopted the Panel's advice in this case. The guideline on\u000d\u000a      sentencing for child abuse image offenses has been referred to and\u000d\u000a      endorsed in 268 appellate cases (54 since 2008). The guidelines for\u000d\u000a      sentencing in rape and child abuse image cases were subsumed within the\u000d\u000a      compendious guidance on sentencing for all sexual offences, issued by the\u000d\u000a      Panel and the SGC in 2005. The sex offence guidelines have been referred\u000d\u000a      to in 97 appellate decisions in 2013 alone.\u000d\u000a    In the early years of the Panel there was considerable judicial\u000d\u000a      scepticism about the guidelines project, but that was overcome, so there\u000d\u000a      is now a high degree of agreement within the profession of the value, and\u000d\u000a      therefore the impact, of sentencing guidelines. The Home Secretary who\u000d\u000a      sponsored the creation of the Panel said in 2008 `It is a remarkable\u000d\u000a      achievement that the Panel is now so highly regarded, not only by the\u000d\u000a      Court of Appeal but by practitioners, academics, and other jurisdictions'\u000d\u000a      (source 7), and the Lord Chancellor during the same period said: `The\u000d\u000a      acceptance of the Panel, and the good relationship it built up, initially\u000d\u000a      with the Court and with the SGC, is due in no small part to [Wasik's]\u000d\u000a      chairmanship ... [Wasik] made a huge contribution' (source 8). Lord Chief\u000d\u000a      Justice Phillips in 2007 said that `... [Wasik's] ability to draw together\u000d\u000a      academics, judges, magistrates and other practitioners, as well as\u000d\u000a      individuals from outside the criminal justice system, has contributed\u000d\u000a      significantly to increasing the Panel's influence' (source 9). Wasik was\u000d\u000a      appointed CBE in 2008 for services to criminal justice.\u000d\u000a    Importance of guidelines for practitioners\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a    Judicial training\u000d\u000a    The proper understanding and application of sentencing guidelines is now\u000d\u000a      a key feature of training for all judges and magistrates who sit in\u000d\u000a      criminal cases. Wasik, due to his role on the Sentencing Guidelines Panel,\u000d\u000a      is one of two keynote speakers (with Professor Ormerod QC) invited to\u000d\u000a      deliver the compulsory judicial training organised by the Judicial\u000d\u000a      College. In 2012 Wasik addressed 90 full-time and part-time Crown Court\u000d\u000a      judges over two days in September. He ran two training sessions for High\u000d\u000a      Court and Court of Appeal judges at the Royal Courts of Justice in October\u000d\u000a      and November 2012. He was the keynote speaker on sentencing in Judicial\u000d\u000a      College courses in April and September 2013 (a total audience of 200\u000d\u000a      judges). He has been retained for similar presentations through 2014 and\u000d\u000a      2015. The published sentencing guidelines are reproduced in full in the\u000d\u000a      relevant practitioner works: Blackstone (where Wasik writes the\u000d\u000a      sentencing material) and Archbold. Blackstone is a leading\u000d\u000a      practitioner work, with copies available on the bench in every criminal\u000d\u000a      court and is regularly cited by the Court of Appeal. Wasik's continuing\u000d\u000a      impact on judicial education was strengthened by his appointment in 2005\u000d\u000a      (to present) as a part-time Crown Court judge, and he sits for up to 30\u000d\u000a      days each year on the Midland Circuit. Training new practitioners and\u000d\u000a      re-training older ones has a direct impact on the effectiveness and\u000d\u000a      integrity of the criminal justice system throughout the UK.\u000d\u000a    Criminal law e-letter\u000d\u000a    Wasik produces (with Professor Ormerod) a monthly criminal law e-letter\u000d\u000a      which is mailed by the Judicial College to all judges who sit in criminal\u000d\u000a      cases. This has been described by HH Judge Phillips, Director of Training\u000d\u000a      for the College as providing a `massive contribution [to] keep[ing] judges\u000d\u000a      up to date with recent developments in criminal law and to alert[ing] them\u000d\u000a      to forthcoming changes. [Wasik and Ormerod] combine academic excellence\u000d\u000a      with a down-to-earth practical approach' (source 10).\u000d\u000a    Informing policy debates in other jurisdictions\u000d\u000a    The working process of the Panel, and the guidelines they produced, have\u000d\u000a      had international reach. The Panel hosted visits from judges and officials\u000d\u000a      from the USA, Canada, South Africa, South Korea, Scotland, New Zealand,\u000d\u000a      and Australia. According to Freiberg (source 11), the Sentencing Council\u000d\u000a      in the Australian State of Victoria chose to follow the Panel's model,\u000d\u000a      since `its membership was broader than that of the US Commissions and its\u000d\u000a      consultations were very wide, partly in order to democratise the\u000d\u000a      decision-making process'.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Martin Wasik's research has made a significant and enduring\u000d\u000a      impact on the law and practice of sentencing &#8212; the scale of which has\u000d\u000a      grown from 2008 onwards. This is evidenced by the adoption in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales of 23 sentencing guidelines developed by the Sentencing Advisory\u000d\u000a      Panel, which he chaired from 1999 to 2007, based on proportionality\u000d\u000a      principles advocated in his research and publications.

Drawing upon the\u000d\u000a      writings of von Hirsch and Ashworth, Wasik has urged the adoption of\u000d\u000a      proportionality (or `desert') as the anchoring principle for the\u000d\u000a      development of sentencing guidelines and as a proportionate constraint on\u000d\u000a      punitive excess (see references 2, 3 and 4, below), but has argued that\u000d\u000a      English guidelines should be narrative in form, rejecting the numerical\u000d\u000a      sentencing `grids' in the USA (e.g. reference 4). This has been the\u000d\u000a      approach adopted by the Panel in its advice, such as that issued by the\u000d\u000a      Sentencing Guidelines Council as Overarching Principles: Seriousness,\u000d\u000a      para 1.4: \"A court is required to pass a sentence which is commensurate\u000d\u000a      with the seriousness of the offence. Seriousness is determined by two main\u000d\u000a      parameters &#8212; the culpability of the offender and the harm caused or risked\u000d\u000a      by the offence\". He also argued for a step-by-step implementation of\u000d\u000a      guidelines, rather than the one-off adoption of an overall scheme. The\u000d\u000a      incremental approach (set out in detail in reference 2 below) has proved\u000d\u000a      highly effective in practice in England and Wales, while ambitious\u000d\u000a      attempts elsewhere (in some US States and in New Zealand) to implement\u000d\u000a      guidelines as a single package have failed completely, through judicial or\u000d\u000a      legislative resistance. Wasik's research has also argued that greater\u000d\u000a      consistency in sentencing can best be achieved through working with judges\u000d\u000a      towards proper engagement with sentencing guidelines, rather than the\u000d\u000a      elimination of judicial discretion (e.g. references 2 and 5).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23137","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Wilkinson's research impacts fall into two main categories: (a) targeted\u000a      interventions in\u000a      policymaking processes, which seek to influence and\/or inform law and\u000a      policy; (b) public and\u000a      stakeholder engagement, which seeks to stimulate and improve the quality\u000a      of debate.\u000a    Influencing and Informing Policymaking\u000a    Since the mid-2000s, Wilkinson has sought to influence and improve\u000a      policymaking by providing\u000a      information and evidence to those involved in policy formation processes\u000a      (including but not limited\u000a      to law reform). Some key examples are listed below.\u000a    (a) Sheldon and Wilkinson's work on `saviour siblings' influenced the Human\u000a        Fertilisation and\u000a        Embryology (HFE) Act 2008. Research carried out between 2003 and\u000a      2009 generated novel\u000a      arguments not only for permitting what came to be known as the creation\u000a      and selection of `saviour\u000a      siblings' but also for the extension of this practice to cases in which\u000a      the recipient is not a sibling,\u000a      cases in which the tissue in question is a solid organ rather than merely\u000a      umbilical cord blood, and\u000a      cases involving non-life-threatening conditions.\u000a    As well as enabling a challenge to `conventional wisdom', this work\u000a      influenced the wording of the\u000a      HFE legislation. One important issue debated in Parliament was whether or\u000a      not the use of `saviour\u000a      siblings' should be restricted to medical conditions which are\u000a      life-threatening or life-shortening.\u000a      Sheldon and Wilkinson submitted written evidence to the Joint Committee on\u000a      the Human Tissue\u000a      and Embryos (Draft) Bill and Lord Jenkin of Roding claimed in the House of\u000a      Lords that this was the\u000a      basis on which his committee came to its view on this matter. He stated -\u000a      \"We [the Joint\u000a      Committee] came to the conclusion that it really would be unduly\u000a      restrictive to refuse permission for\u000a      a saviour sibling to be used in those circumstances. We based this on\u000a        the evidence of two\u000a        distinguished academics, Professor Sheldon and Professor Wilkinson.\u000a      If anyone wants to read it, it\u000a      is in their memorandum at pages 454 and 455 of the evidence\" [source 1].\u000a      In addition, Sheldon\u000a      and Wilkinson's evidence is discussed alongside that of the Human\u000a      Fertilisation and Embryology\u000a      Authority [HFEA] in the written report of the Joint Committee on the Human\u000a      Tissue and Embryos\u000a      (Draft) Bill [source 2].\u000a    (b) Wilkinson submitted written evidence (based on his earlier research\u000a      on selective reproduction)\u000a      to the July 2013 Parliamentary Inquiry into Abortion on the Grounds of\u000a        Disability [source 3].\u000a      He is mentioned eight times in the report.\u000a    (c) Wilkinson is mentioned six times in the Nuffield Council on\u000a        Bioethics' high-profile 2011\u000a        report, Human Bodies donation for medicine and research\u000a      [source 4]. Wilkinson (2003) is\u000a      favourably cited, and the Nuffield Council testify that Wilkinson provided\u000a      thoughtful and challenging\u000a      critiques of the draft ethics chapters, leading to the Working Party\u000a      re-working and\/or strengthening\u000a      the arguments made.\u000a    (d) Wilkinson's research on the ethics of organ donation and sale led to\u000a      membership of the Ethical\u000a        Advisory Sub-Group of the Organ Donation Task Force (established by\u000a      the Department of\u000a      Health). The remit of this group was to advise the main Task Force on the\u000a      ethical bases of different\u000a      consent systems and the ethical acceptability of different systems. The\u000a      work of the Sub-Group was\u000a      reported in the Organ Donation Task Force's report: The Potential\u000a        Impact of an Opt Out System for\u000a        Organ Donation in the UK (November 2008). \u000a    (e) In 2012, Wilkinson acted as the `ethics expert' at a public dialogue\u000a      event in Newcastle-upon-Tyne,\u000a      organised for the HFEA by Dialogue by Design, a consultancy that\u000a      specialises in running\u000a      public and stakeholder engagement processes. The consultation in question\u000a      was entitled Medical\u000a        Frontiers: debating mitochondrial replacement, which the HFEA ran on\u000a      behalf of the UK\u000a      government. His role included giving three short talks on the ethical\u000a      questions, and being on hand\u000a      to help members of the public understand particular issues. These events\u000a      eventually fed into the\u000a      HFEA's 2013 policy recommendations on mitochondrial replacement, which\u000a      have been broadly\u000a      accepted by the UK government.\u000a    Stimulating and Improving Debate\u000a    Wilkinson's work on `social' sex selection stimulated debate amongst the\u000a      public and stakeholders\u000a      and has enabled improved public understanding via a series of appearances\u000a      in popular news\u000a      media. The key findings of this work were widely reported in the media and\u000a      were made available\u000a      via short pieces on the BBC News and This is Staffordshire\u000a      websites. In 2010, these pieces in turn\u000a      led to considerable media interest with interviews given to more than ten\u000a      UK local radio stations, as\u000a      well as to BBC Radio 5 Live, the World Service, LBC, BBC Radio Scotland,\u000a      the BBC TV News\u000a      Channel, and BBC 1 TV's The One Show which at that time had an\u000a      audience of around four million\u000a      viewers. He also appeared on a 30-minute panel discussion on Voice of\u000a      Russia Radio in 2010 to\u000a      discuss Sex Selection.\u000a    In 2011-12, Wilkinson held a Wellcome Trust Dissemination Award\u000a      (&#163;34,000). This grant funded\u000a      the following activities:\u000a    (a) Two stakeholder engagement seminars (2011). Participants\u000a      included representatives or\u000a      members of the following groups: (a) Activist, Campaigning, or Educational\u000a      Organisations with\u000a      special interests in genetic and reproductive technologies (e.g.\u000a      Genewatch, Human Genetics Alert,\u000a      ProChoice Forum, Progress Educational Trust); (b) Health Care\u000a      Professionals (and allied\u000a      Researchers) especially those in Reproductive Medicine; (c) Policy and\u000a      Regulatory Bodies with\u000a      remits or interests in genetic and reproductive technologies (e.g. HFEA,\u000a      Nuffield Council on\u000a      Bioethics); and (d) Stakeholder Organisations representing people with\u000a      disabilities, people with\u000a      particular genetic disorders, or actual\/prospective recipients of\u000a      infertility treatment services.\u000a    (b) The creation of a set of accessible and freely available\u000a        dissemination essays (2013). On\u000a      3rd July 2013, four dissemination essays by Wilkinson and Garrard were\u000a      published by Keele\u000a      University under the collective title Eugenics and the Ethics of\u000a        Selective Reproduction [source 5],\u000a      and released in hard and electronic copy. Written for a public audience,\u000a      they have enabled\u000a      dissemination of Wilkinson's research to hundreds of people in the NHS and\u000a      organisations\u000a      interested in these ethical debates, such as Progress Educational Trust\u000a      who are using the essays\u000a      as a source of information in their work promoting ethically sound\u000a      research and practice in relation\u000a      to genetics.\u000a    The ideas articulated in the essays have also been disseminated to the\u000a      public through the media:\u000a    (a) The essays gained significant and detailed coverage in the international\u000a        media in July 2013\u000a      including in The Independent (2 page article and front page\u000a      banner) [source 6] (78 reader\u000a      comments in July 2013) to which The Guardian wrote a response\u000a      piece [source 7], and which led\u000a      to a debate on Mumsnet with 423 comments in July 2013 [source 8];\u000a      The Telegraph (20 reader\u000a      comments in July 2013); and Arab Emirates' Top News. It was picked\u000a      up internationally on-line and\u000a      through syndication in Canada, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Spain, UAE, and\u000a      Vietnam (for\u000a      example an article was published on Vietnamese Health and Parenting\u000a      Website kien thu'c phu nu\u000a      on 11th July 2013 [source 9]). There was also extensive\u000a      coverage in specialist medical publications\u000a      including: Medical Xpress; The British Medical Journal;\u000a      and by the PGH Foundation. On 3rd July\u000a      2013 Wilkinson participated in radio interviews and debates about the\u000a      issues raised in the essays\u000a      on several BBC radio stations, including: Radio 4 Today, Radio\u000a      London, 5live, and the World\u000a      Service.\u000a    (b) Blog\/Online Publications. The publication of Eugenics and\u000a        the Ethics of Selective\u000a        Reproduction also led to requests for Wilkinson to write blog posts\u000a      and online articles. Wilkinson\u000a      wrote pieces for ETHOX [source 10], the Wellcome Trust Blog,\u000a      and Bionews, which has 18,000\u000a      readers per week.

The Seychelles\u000d\u000a      Bill has been passed into law\u000d\u000a      and the Malawian Bill is currently going through the legislative process.\u000d\u000a    Burdette's scholarship also informs and influences legal practice in\u000d\u000a      South Africa through his\u000d\u000a      contributions to major texts on insolvency law, Meskin and Henochsberg.\u000d\u000a      Both books are the\u000d\u000a      leading textbooks in their respective fields, and are widely used by\u000d\u000a      practitioners in South Africa.\u000d\u000a    b) Insolvency law and practice in the UK\u000d\u000a      A report by Walters (with Armour and Hsu, both external) was commissioned\u000d\u000a      by the Insolvency\u000d\u000a      Service to assess the impact of the virtual abolition of administrative\u000d\u000a      receivership and its\u000d\u000a      replacement with the power to appoint an administrator. It found evidence\u000d\u000a      to support the\u000d\u000a      hypothesis that secured creditor control in bankruptcy (through\u000d\u000a      administrative receivership) does\u000d\u000a      no worse a job than administration, a collective insolvency proceeding, in\u000d\u000a      generating net returns for\u000d\u000a      unsecured creditors. This finding was at odds with claims in the existing\u000d\u000a      law and finance literature\u000d\u000a      which suggested that secured creditor control creates perverse incentives\u000d\u000a      to liquidate assets at fire\u000d\u000a      sale prices without paying due regard to the interests of unsecured\u000d\u000a      creditors. In particular, the\u000d\u000a      report identified that banks are better able than unsecured creditors to\u000d\u000a      control insolvency\u000d\u000a      practitioner costs by negotiating competitive rates. This is because\u000d\u000a      secured creditors, such as\u000d\u000a      banks, are repeat players whereas unsecured creditors are often not repeat\u000d\u000a      players who also\u000d\u000a      suffer from coordination problems. The report also identified that\u000d\u000a      floating charge holders were\u000d\u000a      content for an administrator to be appointed even in cases where\u000d\u000a      administrative receivership was\u000d\u000a      an option available to them, owing to their charges having been granted\u000d\u000a      prior to the Enterprise Act\u000d\u000a      2002 reforms taking effect.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23322","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    a) Access to justice\u000d\u000a    Peysner and Seneviratne's work has been influential nationally and\u000d\u000a      internationally.\u000d\u000a    Peysner was consulted as one of a small group of distinguished academic\u000d\u000a      lawyers as part of the Review of Civil Litigation Costs (Ministry\u000d\u000a      of Justice, 2009) by The Right Hon Lord Justice Jackson (5.4 below).\u000d\u000a      Peysner's article \"Predictability and Budgeting\", (2004) 23 Civil Justice\u000d\u000a      Quarterly 15 was cited in evidence. Prior to this review he also worked\u000d\u000a      with The Law Society's Civil Justice Committee in formulating ideas for\u000d\u000a      the project management of litigation.\u000d\u000a    The Peysner\/Seneviratne report was cited (5.1 below) in the Report of\u000d\u000a        the Scottish Civil Courts Review (2009), at p 105, as evidence that\u000d\u000a      case management conferences were one of the main successes of the civil\u000d\u000a      justice reforms in England and Wales but also that the system of\u000d\u000a      allocating cases to judges could be improved. The findings of the report\u000d\u000a      were also cited in relation to telephone conferences, pre action\u000d\u000a      protocols, settlement offers, the disclosure regime and wasted costs\u000d\u000a      (references in 5.1 below).\u000d\u000a    The Peysner\/Seneviratne report has been widely influential in reviews of\u000d\u000a      civil justice systems in Australia. For example, the report's findings\u000d\u000a      were a key influence underpinning the view in Attorney General of New\u000d\u000a      South Wales, ADR Blueprint Discussion Paper (2009, 5.2 below) that\u000d\u000a      similar reforms, if introduced, should not be prescriptive about the\u000d\u000a      action that a lawyer must take, since this could lead to higher consumer\u000d\u000a      costs in some cases. It was also noted in this report, based on Peysner\u000d\u000a      and Seneviratne, that it was unclear that court annexed mediation produced\u000d\u000a      significant costs savings. Peysner and Seneviratne's findings that the\u000d\u000a      overriding objective gave too much discretion to the courts, resulting in\u000d\u000a      a lack of guidance and inconsistent interpretation of the rules, and that\u000d\u000a      the certainty of the previous system resulted in costs savings, were noted\u000d\u000a      by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its 2010 consultation paper on\u000d\u000a      Discovery in Federal Courts (ALRC CP 2) (5.3 below).\u000d\u000a    b) Complaints handling in the insolvency profession\u000d\u000a    In the present economic climate public confidence in the operation of the\u000d\u000a      insolvency system is high on the agenda as evidenced by the 2008-9 report\u000d\u000a      on Insolvency Practitioners by the House of Commons Business and\u000d\u000a      Enterprise Committee, which cited the work of Seneviratne and Walters.\u000d\u000a      The timeliness of the research therefore magnified its reception and\u000d\u000a      impact.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The immediate beneficiary of the research was its sponsor, the\u000d\u000a        Insolvency Practices Council (\"IPC\"), a public interest body established\u000d\u000a        by the government in 2000 to advise the insolvency profession and its\u000d\u000a        regulators on professional and ethical standards and on matters relating\u000d\u000a        to the regulation of, and complaints about, insolvency practitioners.\u000d\u000a        The research provided the IPC with an evidence base for its\u000d\u000a        recommendations for reform of complaints handling in its Annual Reports,\u000d\u000a        including in 2008 (5.6 below). The IPC closed in December 2011 but the\u000d\u000a        issue of complaints handling by insolvency practitioners remains under\u000d\u000a        review (5.9 below).\u000d\u000a      The IPC's Annual Reports and recommendations were considered by the\u000d\u000a        Joint Insolvency Committee, the body that co-ordinates regulation across\u000d\u000a        the eight organisations that are authorised to license and regulate\u000d\u000a        insolvency practitioners in the UK. The research therefore fed directly\u000d\u000a        into the formal structures that are in place for the co-ordination of\u000d\u000a        regulatory practice.\u000d\u000a      The references to the research in the IPC Annual Reports are\u000d\u000a        indicators of its influence in informing policy\/policy review in respect\u000d\u000a        of complaints handling, potentially influencing insolvency practitioner\u000d\u000a        regulators and affecting the entire community of c.1700 licensed\u000d\u000a        insolvency practitioners.\u000d\u000a      The Seneviratne\/Walters research was also cited in a report of the\u000d\u000a        House of Commons Business and Enterprise Committee in 2009 (5.5 below)\u000d\u000a        and directly informed the Committee's recommendation that the Department\u000d\u000a        of Business, Innovation and Skills should undertake a cost\/benefit\u000d\u000a        analysis of the case for establishing an insolvency ombudsman.\u000d\u000a      The research informed the IPC's call for the Financial Ombudsman\u000d\u000a        Service's jurisdiction to be extended to cover complaints by personal\u000d\u000a        debtors about bad advice received from any insolvency practitioner\u000d\u000a        regardless of whether the practitioner is operating under a standard or\u000d\u000a        group consumer credit licence. The recent application by the Insolvency\u000d\u000a        Practitioners Association for a group consumer credit licence suggests\u000d\u000a        that this recommendation, which derives directly from the research, has\u000d\u000a        gained traction, in spite of its rejection by the Office of Fair Trading\u000d\u000a        (5.8 below).\u000d\u000a      The research has also informed a review of complaints handling and\u000d\u000a        disciplinary practices in the Australian insolvency profession (5.10\u000d\u000a        below).\u000d\u000a      The research was relied upon by the Irish Law Commission upon as an\u000d\u000a        authoritative account of UK insolvency practice and complaints handling\u000d\u000a        (5.7 below).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Researchers, led by Seneviratne, have long influenced debate and had\u000d\u000a      impacts in practice within various dispute resolution frameworks.\u000d\u000a      Seneviratne's work on the civil litigation system (with Peysner), has had\u000d\u000a      broad and significant influence in reviews of civil justice systems\u000d\u000a      internationally, as has Peysner's other research undertaken at this UoA.\u000d\u000a      Seneviratne's work on insolvency complaints and disciplinary procedures\u000d\u000a      (with Walters) has had real influence in informing both domestic\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary and international debate regarding insolvency practitioner\u000d\u000a      regulation.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Nottingham Trent University\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Nottingham Trent University","InstitutionName":"Nottingham Trent University","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10004797}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aJohn Peysner and Mary Seneviratne, The Management of Civil Cases: the\u000d\u000a        Courts and the post-Woolf Landscape, commissioned by the Department\u000d\u000a      for Constitutional Affairs (DCA Research Series 9\/05, 2005).\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000aJohn Peysner, \"Predictability and Budgeting\", (2004) 23 Civil Justice\u000d\u000a      Quarterly 15.\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000aMary Seneviratne and Adrian Walters, Complaints Handling by the\u000d\u000a        Regulators of Insolvency Practitioners: A Comparative Study (2009) &#8212;\u000d\u000a      report for the UK Insolvency Practices Council.\u000d\u000a    \u000a\u000aMary Seneviratne and Adrian Walters, Complaints Handling in the\u000d\u000a        Insolvency Practitioner Profession (2008) Report for the Insolvency\u000d\u000a      Practices Council.\u000d\u000a    \u000aEvidence of the quality of the research:\u000d\u000a    The 2005 report by Peysner and Seneviratne was funded by the Department\u000d\u000a      of Constitutional Affairs.

The resultant UNHCR Report, in which the findings\u000a      of Craig's UK-based\u000a      research are cited more than 250 times, led to profound and lasting\u000a      changes to European asylum\u000a      law and policy.\u000a    CEAS measures-notably the Asylum Procedures Directive (APD), which\u000a      assumes that all EU\u000a      Member States guarantee certain minimum standards of decision-making to\u000a      asylum applicants &#8212;\u000a      and the Dublin regime, whose aim is to ensure that claims for protection\u000a      are made once only in the\u000a      EU-have supported the presumption that equivalent standards of asylum\u000a      decision-making apply\u000a      throughout the EU; these measures have been criticised for deflecting\u000a      asylum seekers away from\u000a      Northern Member States such as the UK, and for putting pressure on the\u000a      asylum systems of EU\u000a      \"entry points\" in Southern and Eastern Member States, including Greece. In\u000a      the past, those who\u000a      managed to travel onward from Greece and then applied for asylum would be\u000a      sent back to Greece\u000a      to make their application.\u000a    Craig led the UK component of a UNHCR Report which exposed numerous\u000a      differences in the ways\u000a      that asylum applications were assessed across 12 EU member states\u000a      (contravening the APD) and\u000a      some practices in these countries that breached international refugee law.\u000a      The UNHCR report\u000a      represented the first and most comprehensive publicly-available\u000a      comparative analysis of asylum\u000a      law and practice undertaken since the APD's adoption. Craig's UK-based\u000a      contribution was\u000a      fundamental to the Report given the UK's extensive reliance on mechanisms,\u000a      such as the Dublin\u000a      Regime and the APD, for returning asylum claimants to other EU Member\u000a      States to have their\u000a      claims considered.The research revealed that Greece had virtually no\u000a      procedures in place at all for\u000a      the proper consideration of asylum claims, meaning that presumptions,\u000a      shown to have been made\u000a      by the UK and other Member States, that asylum claimants could be returned\u000a      to Greece to have\u000a      their claims considered safely, were wrong. Since almost 300,000 people\u000a      apply for asylum\u000a      annually across the European Union and 85% of them enter the EU via\u000a      Greece, the findings of the\u000a      research had important implications for a significant number of vulnerable\u000a      people.\u000a    In 2011, the UNHCR relied on the findings in its submission to the Grand\u000a      Chamber of the ECHR in\u000a      the case MSS v Belgium and Greece (53 EHRR 2) that Greece was not\u000a      implementing EU\u000a      minimum standards for processing asylum claims. In January 2011, the ECHR\u000a      decided, based on\u000a      evidence which included the UNHCR research findings, that the transfer of\u000a      MSS by Belgium to\u000a      Greece would violate his right to an effective remedy. Specifically, the\u000a      judgment stated that \"by\u000a        sending him back to Greece, the Belgian authorities exposed the\u000a        applicant to risks linked to the\u000a        deficiencies in the asylum procedure in that State.\"\u000a    The decision in MSS v Belgium and Greece has been described as a\u000a      catalyst in the rethinking of\u000a      the mechanisms that return people to EU \"entry points\" to have their\u000a      asylum claims considered\u000a      because the Court accepted that the assumption of equivalent standards\u000a      across EU Member\u000a      States (which underpins such mechanisms) was unreliable.\u000a    As a direct result of the legal finding, based on evidence of practices\u000a      in Greece including the\u000a      UNHCR research and placing the burden of proof in cases concerning Greece\u000a      on the sending\u000a      country, other EU countries have stopped sending asylum applicants back to\u000a      Greece. This has\u000a      resulted in improved access to justice for this vulnerable group.\u000a      Following the ECHR's ruling, the\u000a      Federal Administrative Court in Switzerland issued a ruling indicating\u000a      that transfers to Greece\u000a      would have to be examined on a case-by-case basis. German courts also\u000a      halted a number of\u000a      transfers, to Malta and Italy, on grounds of alleged deficiencies in the\u000a      asylum system. Additionally,\u000a      on 31 October 2011 the Austrian Asylum Court quashed a decision to\u000a      transfer asylum-seekers to\u000a      Hungary to have their claims processed. The decision referred to the UNHCR\u000a      research findings of\u000a      contravention of the APD.\u000a    The UNHCR subsequently issued detailed recommendations for the\u000a      improvement of procedures in\u000a      all countries involved in the research study, including the UK. These\u000a      recommendations contributed\u000a      to the scope of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) to coordinate\u000a      support actions with\u000a      Member States facing pressures on their asylum support systems. EASO,\u000a      established by\u000a      Regulation 439\/20101 of the European Parliament and the Council in May\u000a      2010, strengthens EU\u000a      Member States' practical cooperation on asylum, enhances the\u000a      implementation of the CEAS and\u000a      supports Member States whose asylum and reception systems are under\u000a      particular pressure.\u000a      Under Article 10 of the Regulation establishing EASO, it states that EASO\u000a      will draw upon findings\u000a      and documentation from UNHCR research in the course of its operations.\u000a      From the very start of its\u000a      activities, and following the ruling in MSS v. Belgium and Greece, support\u000a      for Greece has been one\u000a      of EASOs main objectives. On 1 April 2011, just 2 months after becoming\u000a      operational as an EU\u000a      Agency, EASO and the Greek government signed an agreement on the\u000a      deployment of Asylum\u000a      Support Teams (ASTs) to Greece. EASO prioritised Emergency Support to\u000a      Greece through the\u000a      deployment of additional ASTs throughout 2012.\u000a    As a result of these cases, the UNHCR Report, to which Craig's research\u000a      made a significant\u000a      contribution, has had a profound impact on asylum law and policy. The\u000a      original court case and\u000a      others following it have been widely covered in the press, contributing to\u000a      public debate on asylum\u000a      procedures and the assumptions surrounding their fairness.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Of the over 300,000 applicants seeking asylum in the European Union each\u000a      year, 85% enter the\u000a      EU through Greece.

From its\u000a      inception, the CEAS has been characterised by competing pressures which\u000a      have hindered its\u000a      potential to develop into a framework aimed at offering protection to\u000a      those fleeing persecution. One\u000a      element of the CEAS, in particular, that is criticised for its targeted\u000a      deflection of refugees is the\u000a      Dublin Regime; this mechanism creates a hierarchy of criteria for\u000a      identifying the EU Member State\u000a      responsible for the examination of an asylum claim. This responsibility\u000a      lies predominantly with the\u000a      Member State which the asylum seeker first entered and the aim of the\u000a      Regime is to ensure that\u000a      applicants only claim asylum in one EU State.\u000a    Sarah Craig (Lecturer, Public Law, 2006-present) has developed a body of\u000a      research on legal and\u000a      procedural aspects of asylum and immigration processes in the UK and\u000a      Europe. Throughout her\u000a      research, Craig has demonstrated how negative integration in the EU, which\u000a      refers to integration\u000a      that is achieved by removing barriers between countries, was bad for\u000a      refugees. Craig has argued\u000a      that negative integration, through the introduction of a CEAS, encouraged\u000a      Member States to `race\u000a      to the bottom' by using it as a reason for unpicking national measures\u000a      which protected the rights of\u000a      asylum seekers at a higher level than the EU's minimum standards under the\u000a      CEAS. National\u000a      governments' anxiety not to be seen as a `soft touch' for asylum seekers\u000a      in comparison with their\u000a      European neighbours further compounded this problem.\u000a    In 2005, by which time the relevant CEAS Directives had been framed and\u000a      were starting to come\u000a      into force, Maria Fletcher (Senior Lecturer, Law, University of Glasgow\u000a      staff 2000-present)\u000a      developed this theme with Craig in their book chapter \"Deflecting\u000a      Refugees: a Critique of the\u000a      Asylum Procedures Directive\" in P. Shah (ed.) The Challenge of Asylum\u000a        to Legal Systems\u000a      (Cavendish, 2005). From 2006, Craig (Principal Investigator), Fletcher and\u000a      Kay Goodall (University\u000a      of Stirling) worked on a research project funded by the Nuffield\u000a      Foundation which examined the\u000a      operation of novel paper-based onward appeal procedures, introduced\u000a      throughout the UK in 2005,\u000a      but with different specific procedures in Scotland; publishing the\u000a      research in 2008 (Craig, Fletcher\u000a      and Goodall, Challenging Asylum and Immigration Tribunal Decisions in\u000a        Scotland: an evaluation of\u000a        onward appeals and reconsiderations). During that period, the Deputy\u000a      Director of the Nuffield\u000a      Foundation put the researchers in contact with Professor Robert Thomas\u000a      (Manchester University),\u000a      who was conducting Nuffield Foundation-funded research into asylum appeals\u000a      in England and\u000a      Wales. This contact led, at Robert Thomas' recommendation, to Craig being\u000a      approached by United\u000a      Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR) to be the UK's National\u000a      Project Officer in their\u000a      EU-wide research project into the implementation of the Asylum Procedures\u000a      Directive (APD);\u000a      research which was also aimed at making recommendations for reform. Craig\u000a      conducted this\u000a      research in conjunction with June Fraser (Immigration Practitioner). Craig\u000a      was able to bring both\u000a      her expertise as a legal practitioner as well as her extensive academic\u000a      knowledge to the research,\u000a      which complemented Fraser's contributions. In particular, Craig was able\u000a      to draw from her\u000a      research undertaken as part of the Nuffield Foundation research into\u000a      onward appeal procedures\u000a      which involved qualitative interviews with asylum applicants, UK Border\u000a      Agency (UKBA) and legal\u000a      practitioners, and judges.\u000a    The research analysed the implementation of the APD in UK law and\u000a      practice and compiled a\u000a      National Report on the findings. Facilitating the examination of the UK's\u000a      implementation in practice,\u000a      the UKBA allowed the researchers high-level access to interviews,\u000a      decisions and staff to facilitate\u000a      the examination of the UK's implementation of the APD in practice. The\u000a      same access was\u000a      negotiated in the other 11 Member States involved in the study, and the\u000a      National Reports were\u000a      synthesised into a Key Recommendations Document, and Detailed Reports on\u000a      Key Provisions,\u000a      which were published in March 2010. The governmental support for the\u000a      research, illustrated by the\u000a      fact that all participating countries gave access to the decision-making\u000a      process at the same time,\u000a      was a crucial part of the study.\u000a    All 18 articles of the APD were covered in the investigation, as they are\u000a      transposed in law and\u000a      implemented in practice in the 12 participating states: Belgium, Bulgaria,\u000a      Czech Republic, Finland,\u000a      France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the\u000a      United Kingdom. The\u000a      UK had been used by the UNHCR as a benchmarker of good practice in asylum\u000a      procedures for\u000a      new Member States. Craig's research on the UK was therefore an essential\u000a      element of the study.\u000a    The research team found numerous differences in the ways that asylum\u000a      applications are assessed,\u000a      and some practices that breached international refugee law. In particular,\u000a      the UK arm of the\u000a      UNHCR research, led by Craig, showed that the UK's procedures and\u000a      practices allowed people to\u000a      be removed to Greece for the processing of their claims, with no prior\u000a      substantive interview to\u000a      determine whether they had a stateable case and no right of appeal. This\u000a      was particularly\u000a      significant because the research revealed that Greece had procedures in\u000a      place which would\u000a      effectively refoule people to persecution contrary to the Refugee\u000a      Convention.\u000a    The Refugee Convention requires that applicants are given an opportunity\u000a      to present their claim to\u000a      a determining authority which gives individual consideration to their\u000a      protection needs. The main\u000a      findings of the study were that applicants were not always afforded\u000a      personal interviews, or were\u000a      not given enough time to prepare for interviews or to explain their\u000a      claims. Interpreters were not\u000a      always available or qualified, some decisions were not individually\u000a      motivated, and many claimants\u000a      were channeled into accelerated procedures, with reduced safeguards. The\u000a      UNHCR were\u000a      concerned by such practices creating the risk that protection needs are\u000a      not properly identified, and\u000a      persons may be sent back to persecution or serious harm (UNHCR,\u000a        Press Release, 25 March 2010).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23606","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"878675","Name":"Zimbabwe"},{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"},{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2233387","Name":"Cameroon"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Lambert's and Phillips's research has reached so far as to\u000d\u000a      inform and directly influence judicial\u000d\u000a      decisions of the UTIAC in Country Guidance cases.

Phillips's\u000d\u000a      expert submission significantly informed the UTIAC's decision, as is clear\u000d\u000a      from their repeated\u000d\u000a      references to his research in their development of Country Guidance.\u000d\u000a    In LZ (Zimbabwe), the determination by UT explicitly cites the\u000d\u000a      evidence of Phillips in over 35\u000d\u000a      different places, including:\u000d\u000a    a) At paragraph 8, the UT appraises Phillips's contribution \"He is a well\u000d\u000a      qualified and recognised\u000d\u000a      expert.... His evidence has been of high value, although we have not\u000d\u000a      accepted all of his\u000d\u000a      conclusions.\" Similarly at paras 105, 106, and 109 the UT explicitly\u000d\u000a      recognises the significant\u000d\u000a      impact of his evidence on their determination, while also articulating\u000d\u000a      some limits to this.\u000d\u000a    b) The UT's determination draws directly from the research in publication\u000d\u000a      3(iii) (above), at para 30\u000d\u000a      of the judgement drawing on Phillips's analysis of the judicial and\u000d\u000a      constitutional process, and\u000d\u000a      para 75 on gender relations.\u000d\u000a    c) Similarly, from 3(ii) above, the UT draws directly on Phillips's\u000d\u000a      analysis of case-law, and\u000d\u000a      unreported cases (in Magistrate's Courts) to reveal patterns of\u000d\u000a      prosecution and attitudes of the\u000d\u000a      police and the judiciary at para 31-38 of the UT's determination.\u000d\u000a    d) At para 43-44 of the judgement the UT draws directly on Phillips's\u000d\u000a      recent research on blackmail\u000d\u000a      published in 3(iv) above, and accepts his evidence and analysis\u000d\u000a      unreservedly.\u000d\u000a    Phillips's research has also contributed to the development of\u000d\u000a      strategies by organizations\u000d\u000a      campaigning for law reform and sexual rights, and also government\u000d\u000a      departments. This is\u000d\u000a      evidenced by regular consultation, and participation in strategic\u000d\u000a      committees. Phillips's research\u000d\u000a      (ref. 3(iii)) led the Swedish Department of Foreign Affairs to hire him to\u000d\u000a      brief the new Swedish\u000d\u000a      Ambassador to Zimbabwe (September 2010). The Minist&#232;re des Affaires\u000d\u000a      Etrang&#232;res of the French\u000d\u000a      Government appointed Phillips as `external evaluator' for bids received\u000d\u000a      from LGBT advocacy\u000d\u000a      groups around the world, for funding being offered by that Ministry (Nov.\u000d\u000a      2010 &#8212; Feb. 2011). This\u000d\u000a      appointment means direct intervention in the decision to distribute funds\u000d\u000a      to 3 LGBT projects\u000d\u000a      (selected from 123 bids around the world), offering a maximum amount of\u000d\u000a      180 000 Euros.\u000d\u000a      The publications listed in s.3 have also contributed to the strategic\u000d\u000a      deliberations of Human Rights\u000d\u000a      Watch (HRW www.hrw.org) and International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights\u000d\u000a      Commission\u000d\u000a      (IGLHRC www.iglhrc.org). The blackmail article published in the IJHR\u000d\u000a      (ref. 3(iv)) was chosen by\u000d\u000a      IGLHRC to be reprinted as the Introductory \"framing\" chapter for their\u000d\u000a      special report on Blackmail\u000d\u000a      in Southern Africa. Subsequently, IGLHRC invited Phillips onto their Board\u000d\u000a      of Directors (from Feb.\u000d\u000a      2011) in order to benefit more directly from his knowledge of the research\u000d\u000a      field and analysis of\u000d\u000a      LGBT analysis on a global scale. IGLHRC is a leading international\u000d\u000a      organization whose advocacy\u000d\u000a      has played a key role in the release of people detained on account of the\u000d\u000a      sexual orientation in\u000d\u000a      many countries, including most recently Cameroon, Nepal, Malawi and Egypt.\u000d\u000a      This Commission\u000d\u000a      was also instrumental in gaining consultative status for LGBT groups at\u000d\u000a      the United Nations, and\u000d\u000a      reports regularly to the UN Human Rights Committee, UN Special Rapporteurs\u000d\u000a      and relevant\u000d\u000a      human rights Treaty Bodies (e.g. Committee for the Elimination of\u000d\u000a      Discrimination against Women\u000d\u000a      CEDAW).

Her\u000d\u000a      research examined four metrics for assessing conflict severity: battle\u000d\u000a      deaths, civilian casualties,\u000d\u000a      population displacements and state failure, and showed how the first two\u000d\u000a      metrics (currently used in\u000d\u000a      the major databases on armed conflict) display significant and often\u000d\u000a      underappreciated analytical\u000d\u000a      and methodological limitations. The last two metrics also present\u000d\u000a      considerable methodological\u000d\u000a      challenges in application, but promise more analytical leverage in\u000d\u000a      assessing the true risk to civilian\u000d\u000a      populations in an armed conflict. This analysis was situated in the\u000d\u000a      context of the emerging CEAS\u000d\u000a      and discussed the practical challenges faced by the EU Court of Justice\u000d\u000a      and the senior UK and\u000d\u000a      French courts in using these four metrics through a comprehensive analysis\u000d\u000a      of the emerging case\u000d\u000a      law from these courts. This research (leading to ref (i) listed in s.3)\u000d\u000a      was used by the Upper Tribunal\u000d\u000a      to outline its approach to assessing conflict severity and the risk to\u000d\u000a      civilians in Iraq in a country\u000d\u000a      guidance case HM and Others (Iraq), which is where Lambert's\u000d\u000a      claimed-impact lies (see s.4\u000d\u000a      below).\u000d\u000a    Phillips's research analyzes the relationship between human\u000d\u000a      rights, sexual orientation and\u000d\u000a      gender identity in post-colonial Southern Africa, with particular focus on\u000d\u000a      the interaction between\u000d\u000a      criminal law, customary law, constitutional rights and political dynamics\u000d\u000a      in Zimbabwe and South\u000d\u000a      Africa; this has offered detailed reviews of the legal and social\u000d\u000a      treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual\u000d\u000a      and transgender (LGBT) people in Zimbabwe, which have directly informed\u000d\u000a      adjudication of LGBT\u000d\u000a      asylum claims from Zimbabwe in the UK. The initial research project,\u000d\u000a      funded by a Smuts Travel\u000d\u000a      Grant from the University of Cambridge, led to the award of a PhD for\u000d\u000a      Phillips' thesis Sexual Offences\u000d\u000a        in Zimbabwe: Fetishisms of Procreation, Perversion and Individual\u000d\u000a        Autonomy (Institute of Criminology,\u000d\u000a      University of Cambridge, 1999).

SEARCWL has funded his return to Zimbabwe and the\u000d\u000a      region each year since 2003, sustaining the continuation of his research.\u000d\u000a    Key elements of Phillips's research, used in adjudication of\u000d\u000a      asylum claims in the UK, include\u000d\u000a      analysis of all the case law relating to the prosecution of homosexual\u000d\u000a      offences in Zimbabwe and other\u000d\u000a      legal measures that have impacted on the lives of LGBT people (discovered\u000d\u000a      through interviews, and\u000d\u000a      research of archives, law reports, police dockets etc.), thereby\u000d\u000a      highlighting a pattern of state\u000d\u000a      prosecution (ref. 3(ii)). The research has also focused on the role of the\u000d\u000a      Constitution, and the\u000d\u000a      relationship between criminal and customary law, in framing the strong\u000d\u000a      political rhetoric that has\u000d\u000a      shaped attitudes to sexual orientation and gender identity in Zimbabwe\u000d\u000a      over the last 15 years (ref.\u000d\u000a      3(iii)). It has also provided a specific analysis of how this context has\u000d\u000a      led LGBT people to find\u000d\u000a      themselves frequent targets for blackmail; one publication specifically\u000d\u000a      considered the extent to which\u000d\u000a      the domestic law confronts or compounds blackmail, and the limits of\u000d\u000a      challenging it through the\u000d\u000a      human rights framework (ref. 3(iv)).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23614","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As noted above, the Government consulted on the advertising and trading\u000d\u000a      regulations in March\u000d\u000a      2011, in the run up to the London 2012 Olympics.

Aggregated data will be made available to the\u000a      public and the LSB\u000a      reserves the right to require the frontline regulators to remedy diversity\u000a      problems within firms and\u000a      chambers, where they persist over time.\u000a    The introduction of compulsory diversity monitoring and reporting has\u000a      sparked increased debate in\u000a      the legal professional press about the factors that contribute to a lack\u000a      of female representation in\u000a      the higher levels of the legal profession, and the attrition of BME\u000a      would-be lawyers as between\u000a      graduation and professional qualification. Further, it has led to the\u000a      further development of a range\u000a      of diversity initiatives that seek to encourage pupils from minority and\u000a      lower socio-economic groups\u000a      to aspire to a career in the legal profession, as well as others that\u000a      develop more systematic\u000a      mentoring schemes for young lawyers, others that seek to introduce more\u000a      fair and transparent\u000a      work allocation systems within law firms: see for example: Katy Dowell\u000a      `Freshfields adds socio-\u000a      economic background to census questions' The Lawyer 28th\u000a      February 2011 page 5.

Thus, our findings have the possibility of reshaping the\u000a      legal profession, as law firms,\u000a      barristers chambers and other legal entities are required to both report\u000a      on and to justify their\u000a      recruitment and retention of solicitors and barristers with reference to\u000a      diversity criteria.

Different career trajectories may have been the result of\u000a      individual choices, or the\u000a      availability of opportunities in an individual's first choice field, or a\u000a      combination of these factors.\u000a      Insight into the ways in which these factors drive career paths could only\u000a      be gained through in\u000a      depth exploration. The Legal Services Board (LSB) therefore commissioned Professor\u000a        Webley\u000a      (grant holder; category A staff at Westminster throughout), Duff\u000a      (Head of Department, category A\u000a      staff throughout), Professor Sommerlad (University of Birmingham),\u000a      Professor Muzio (University\u000a      of Newcastle), and Professor Tomlinson (University of Leeds) to undertake\u000a      a rigorous and\u000a      extensive qualitative study of female and BME professionals, at a variety\u000a      of career stages including\u000a      pre-entry, in a range of specialisms and sectors, in the North and South\u000a      of England, to investigate\u000a      the reasons for these practitioners' career patterns. The team conducted\u000a      socio-biographical depth\u000a      interviews with 76 lawyers and would-be lawyers including solicitors,\u000a      barristers, legal executives,\u000a      law graduates and law firm diversity managers in 2010.\u000a    The main themes revealed by our data analysis, included: the\u000a      fragmentation of the profession and\u000a      consequent nuanced nature of respondents' experiences; the legacy of the\u000a      profession's origins\u000a      and the significance of cultural stereotypes; the importance for career\u000a      success of personal\u000a      relations\/ bonding, socialising and informal culture and practices\u000a      relating to mentoring and work\u000a      allocation; the long hours' culture and emphasis on commitment (rarely\u000a      defined); and the lack of\u000a      transparency of some key procedures and practices in some organisations.\u000a      Our respondents\u000a      generally accepted that positive changes had taken place and were\u000a      continuing so to do, partly\u000a      reflected in the adoption of formal processes in some organisations.\u000a      Following a review of\u000a      academic, policy and professional press literatures and in light of our\u000a      empirical findings, we made a\u000a      series of recommendations aimed at improving diversity within the legal\u000a      labour market. These\u000a      were aimed at both employer organisations and regulators. One of our key\u000a      recommendations was\u000a      that law firms and chambers should be required to collect diversity data\u000a      from their staff and to\u000a      report the data to the legal regulators so as to permit them to monitor\u000a      diversity within organisations\u000a      and across specialisms and sectors. We also made a series of\u000a      recommendations relating to\u000a      workload allocation, flexible working, mentoring and diversity training,\u000a      some of which are being\u000a      developed by firms and chambers.\u000a    The LSB project built upon our findings from two previous Law Society\u000a      Projects. The first was\u000a      commissioned by the Law Society of England and Wales and was undertaken by\u000a      Duff and Webley\u000a      (Westminster) in 2003-04. It was a qualitative study undertaken via small\u000a      group interviews; women\u000a      solicitors were interviewed about their reasons for leaving the profession\u000a      or for having a break in\u000a      their period of practice to examine in depth the earlier findings from the\u000a      Law Society's quantitative\u000a      study indicating an attrition rate of 3:1 women to male solicitors from\u000a      the profession. Our findings\u000a      included the identification of women solicitors' concerns about working\u000a      conditions: the long hours\u000a      culture, lack of diversity in working models, and the mechanisms and\u000a      attributes used to determine\u000a      promotion and salary. They highlighted career progression issues: the\u000a      difficulty of changing subject\u000a      specialism, problems associated with trying to gain employment after even\u000a      a very short career\u000a      break, difficulties in achieving billing targets given obfuscatory\u000a      workload allocation models and the\u000a      lack of transparency in pay scales. It provided a rich vein of data about\u000a      the lived experiences of\u000a      women solicitors that allowed the Law Society to develop their equality\u000a      and diversity agenda, upon\u000a      which the LSB has built. The second Law Society project was commissioned\u000a      in 1998 and was the\u000a      sixth year of a quantitative cohort study following law students through\u000a      their training and\u000a      employment progression (Shiner, Boon category a staff until\u000a      September 2013 and Duff). This\u000a      ground-breaking cohort study allowed Law Society data on entry and\u000a      progression within the\u000a      profession to be stratified by gender, ethnicity, background and seniority\u000a      and shed light on the\u000a      segmented nature of the solicitors' profession. One of the key findings\u000a      was the lack of diversity and\u000a      social mobility within certain sections of the legal profession, which\u000a      contributed to the Law\u000a      Society's initiatives in this field, upon which the LSB diversity agenda\u000a      built.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23842","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Barlow's research at Exeter on cohabitation, marriage and the law has\u000d\u000a      been at the forefront of the fiercely contested public and policy debates\u000d\u000a      over cohabitation law reform &#8212; an issue central to the lives of 2.9\u000d\u000a      million cohabiting couples and their children.

The report's impact continued well into 2008 as the\u000d\u000a      government deliberated over the Commission's recommendation to introduce\u000d\u000a      new legal rights for cohabiting couples upon separation. Barlow was active\u000d\u000a      in influencing the reform debates. In January 2008, she presented\u000d\u000a      her conclusions at the media launch of the 24th British Social Attitudes\u000d\u000a      Survey. National media including The Guardian and Radio 4's Woman's\u000a        Hour reported the findings, highlighting continuing public ignorance\u000d\u000a      over common law marriage.7 The Nuffield Foundation invited\u000d\u000a      Barlow to deliver her findings to policymakers, lawyers, judges and\u000d\u000a      academics. In March 2008 she gave a public lecture at the Institute of\u000d\u000a      Advanced Legal Studies, London. As a result of this dissemination, the\u000d\u000a        research became widely known and was used by Resolution, (the\u000d\u000a      Solicitors' Family Law Association), to support its national campaign to\u000a        call for reform of cohabitation law.8\u000d\u000a    The government announcement in March 2008 that it would take no action on\u000d\u000a      the Law Commission's recommendations until research evaluated the similar\u000d\u000a      scheme in Scotland prompted Resolution, in a statement covered by BBC\u000d\u000a      News, to accuse the government of being \"seriously out of step with public\u000d\u000a      opinion\", citing Barlow's research. The debate continued into 2009,\u000d\u000a      culminating in a Private Member's Cohabitation Bill by Liberal Democrat\u000d\u000a      peer Lord Lester, supported by Resolution. Resolution and Lester's offices\u000d\u000a      contacted Barlow after her Nuffield seminar and the research informed\u000d\u000a        the Bill's contents.8. A briefing paper summarising her\u000d\u000a      research was sent to MPs and peers to inform the parliamentary debates and\u000d\u000a      proved instrumental to both sides. During the second reading of the Bill\u000d\u000a      in the Lords on March 13, 2009, the Attorney General cited Barlow's\u000d\u000a        findings of improved public awareness resulting from the Living Together\u000d\u000a        Campaign to justify government policy opposing the Bill, which\u000d\u000a      consequently did not progress beyond Committee stage, stating, 'The media\u000a        campaign LivingTogether is now in its fourth year. A study by Professor\u000d\u000a        Anne Barlow has assessed that campaign, and she says that it is very\u000d\u000a        positive.'

Thus her research has shaped legal advice and\u000d\u000a        information. Barlow's Living Together Campaign evaluation was\u000d\u000a      published on the MoJ website in 2007; it is still available and its\u000d\u000a      contents secured further funding for the campaign. A legal aid\u000d\u000a      leaflet published in 2009 by the Legal Services Commission references\u000d\u000a      Barlow's continuing common law marriage myth. A 2012 Home Office report on\u000d\u000a      cohabitation for all Members of Parliament (available in the House of\u000d\u000a      Commons library) drew on Barlow's Exeter data, stating9,\u000d\u000a    `Generally...there is no specific legal status for what is often\u000d\u000a        referred to as a \"common law marriage\".

Other\u000d\u000a      research by Barlow has been central to Law Commission activities. The\u000d\u000a      Commission's 2009 consultation paper on intestacy referenced Barlow's\u000d\u000a      Exeter cohabitation research 10 times, with its 2011 report citing it in\u000d\u000a      five places. Her research showing the continued existence of the\u000d\u000a      common law marriage myth (Barlow et al 2008) was confirmed as `a\u000d\u000a        powerful factor' in the Commission recommending and drafting a\u000d\u000a        Bill giving qualifying cohabitants automatic succession rights from\u000d\u000a      their deceased partner's estate on intestacy (Law Commission, 2011).3\u000d\u000a      The Community of Property research and Barlow's recent Pre-nuptial\u000d\u000a      Agreements study are cited in the Commission's 2011 and 2012 consultations\u000d\u000a      on Marital Property Agreements some six times.4,5 Their 2012\u000d\u000a      paper confirms `We were assisted by research ...carried out by\u000d\u000a        Professor Anne Barlow and Dr Janet Smithson of the University of Exeter'.5\u000d\u000a      The Commission plans to use the academics' data in its final report,\u000d\u000a      anticipating that it will provide \"important indications\" of public\u000d\u000a      attitudes towards pre-nuptial agreements and organised a joint conference\u000d\u000a      with Barlow for policymakers, academics and practitioners on 4 December\u000d\u000a      2012 to discuss reform in the light of research evidence.\u000d\u000a    Her pre-nuptial agreement research is also influencing the judiciary.\u000d\u000a      Mr Justice Coleridge invited Barlow to present this research at a Marriage\u000d\u000a      Foundation conference to a large audience of practitioners and policy\u000d\u000a      makers on 15th February 2013 and Lady Hale indicated in her\u000d\u000a      plenary address to the SLSA conference in March 2013 that if it had been\u000d\u000a      published in time, she `would no doubt have referred to it' in her\u000d\u000a      dissenting judgment in Radmacher v Granatino [2010] UKSC 42.10\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research undertaken by Barlow at Exeter into cohabitation, marriage and\u000d\u000a      the law has shaped, informed and influenced long-running public\u000a        and policy debates in Britain over the need to reform aspects of\u000d\u000a      family (property) law, in light of widespread public confusion and\u000d\u000a      on-going societal shifts.

She then undertook and published from two further funded\u000d\u000a      family property-focused studies on Community of Property (2004-2006) and\u000d\u000a      Pre-nuptial Agreements (2010-2012). This research underpins the\u000d\u000a      significant impact her research has achieved in the fields of family law\u000d\u000a      and policy with a range of users.\u000d\u000a    Her 2005 book advocated legal and policy responses (including a public\u000d\u000a      information campaign as one contributory option (pp. 107-110)) to reflect\u000d\u000a      the changing social realities of marriage decline and cohabitation growth.\u000d\u000a      Having proved national confusion over `common law marriage', a term that\u000d\u000a      has wide social usage but no legal force, her work had previously\u000d\u000a      convinced policymakers to launch a three year public information campaign\u000d\u000a      to dispel the myth that legally, cohabitants had marriage-equivalence (The\u000a        Living Together Campaign). Barlow was then selected to evaluate this\u000d\u000a      in terms of its effects on legal awareness and cohabitant behaviour and\u000d\u000a      decision-making. This evaluation was one of two related projects,\u000d\u000a      conducted when debates over cohabitation law reform reached their height\u000d\u000a      (2006-2009), which underpin her impact on cohabitation law and policy,\u000d\u000a      namely- The Living Together Campaign &#8212; An Evaluation and The\u000d\u000a        Common Law Marriage Myth Revisited. Working with Burgoyne (Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer, Psychology), and Research Fellow, Smithson (Law), Barlow\u000d\u000a      employed mixed methods approaches, including longitudinal quantitative and\u000d\u000a      qualitative techniques to evaluate the impact of The Living Together\u000d\u000a        Campaign and to ascertain more in-depth understanding of changing\u000d\u000a      public attitudes to marriage, cohabitation, current law and possible\u000d\u000a      reform. She concluded the campaign's attempt to inform cohabiting couples\u000d\u000a      of their legal rights had resulted in successes: 51% of the general public\u000d\u000a      and 53% of cohabitants believed the common law marriage myth in 2006 (down\u000d\u000a      respectively from 56% and 59% in 2001); 61% of the public also correctly\u000d\u000a      believed marriage offered greater financial security (up from 48%). Yet\u000d\u000a      she also found the campaign had increased uncertainty rather than directly\u000d\u000a      improved legal understanding. Her analysis concluded that most people\u000d\u000a      marry according to emotion rather than issues of legal and financial\u000d\u000a      status on relationship breakdown or death and that most cohabitants\u000d\u000a      exhibit an optimism bias about their relationship, the possibility of them\u000d\u000a      or their partner dying and about their ability resolve disputes amicably\u000d\u000a      on relationship breakdown. This prevents couples taking appropriate\u000d\u000a      protective legal action, such as making wills and\/or cohabitation\u000d\u000a      agreements. Public support for legal reform was very strong with 90%\u000d\u000a      believing a long-term cohabiting partner should be entitled to financial\u000d\u000a      provision on separation if children are involved and 66% agreeing a\u000d\u000a      cohabitant without children should inherit the family home owned by their\u000d\u000a      partner on their death where no will was made after just two years of\u000d\u000a      living together (Barlow et al 2008, 2010). MoJ published the campaign\u000d\u000a      evaluation in 2007 (Barlow et al, 2007) after Ministry scrutiny. The\u000d\u000a      related Nuffield study's findings appeared in the prestigious 2008 24th\u000d\u000a      British Social Attitudes Survey (Barlow et al, 2008) and a joint further\u000d\u000a      analysis of both projects was subsequently undertaken by Barlow and\u000d\u000a      Smithson and published in a highly regarded peer-reviewed specialist law\u000d\u000a      journal (see `Legal assumptions, cohabitants' talk and the rocky road to\u000d\u000a      reform' Child and Family Law Quarterly (2010) 22(3):328-350).\u000d\u000a    Barlow's research into reforming financial provision on relationship\u000d\u000a      breakdown continued through two socio-legal empirical studies on family\u000d\u000a      property issues. With Cooke (PI) and Callus (Reading University), she\u000d\u000a      investigated whether a system of European-style community of property &#8212;\u000d\u000a      formalising a 50\/50 property split on divorce\/separation\/death &#8212; would\u000d\u000a      improve the uncertain discretionary approach in England and Wales in a\u000d\u000a      peer reviewed Nuffield Foundation study (&#163;89,000). Published in 2006, it\u000d\u000a      concluded that whilst attractive, it risked the loss of contextually\u000d\u000a      important flexibility (see Cooke, E., Barlow, A. and Callus, T.\u000d\u000a      (2006) Community of Property: A Regime for England and Wales?:\u000d\u000a        Bristol: Policy Press). Drawing on this study and on her\u000d\u000a      cohabitation and marriage research findings alongside doctrinal analysis\u000d\u000a      of case law, Barlow, at the invitation of the Max Planck Institute and the\u000d\u000a      German Ministry of Youth and Families, provided a socio-legal analysis of\u000d\u000a      the inconsistent treatment in English family and welfare law of the value\u000d\u000a      of non-financial contributions to married, cohabiting and single parent\u000d\u000a      relationships. She concluded that family and welfare law should work in\u000d\u000a      tandem, not pull in opposite directions, to avoid relationship-generated\u000d\u000a      disadvantage. This was published as evidence in Germany's discussion of\u000d\u000a      options for reform of their community of property system and possible\u000d\u000a      effects on state welfare provision (Barlow, 2008).\u000d\u000a    Her later Nuffield Foundation-funded peer reviewed project Exploring\u000d\u000a        Pre-Nuptial Perceptions was undertaken with Smithson\u000d\u000a      (Law\/Psychology, Exeter) at a time when the Law Commission was conducting\u000d\u000a      reform considerations on marital agreements. This used mixed methods,\u000d\u000a      combining analysis of a nationally representative survey with a purposive,\u000d\u000a      qualitative follow-up study, to explore for the first time public\u000d\u000a      perceptions of binding pre-nuptial agreements as a mechanism to address\u000d\u000a      this financial uncertainty on divorce in England and Wales. Findings\u000d\u000a      published in a specialist peer-reviewed law journal in 2012, showed\u000d\u000a      support for such agreements to become binding in some circumstances but\u000d\u000a      significant reservations in others, with a noted gendered division of\u000d\u000a      responses on some issues but not others (Barlow and Smithson, 2012).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23843","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    (i) Impact on policy\u000a    All three studies have had a direct influence on government policy.\u000a    Shared time\/shared care: A key policy question has been whether to\u000a      amend the Children Act 1989 to include a statutory presumption of shared\u000a      time following parental separation. Trinder was a key player in this\u000a      debate, making oral and written submissions to national-level policy\u000a      reviews based on her 2010 research. Evidence of Trinder's impact on the\u000a      policy process starts with the Interim Report1,9 of the Family\u000a      Justice Review (FJR) a committee of inquiry set up by government. The\u000a      Review recommended against a \"substantially shared or equal time\"\u000a      presumption, citing Trinder's CFLQ findings that the cooperation required\u000a      to make shared contact work in high conflict families could not be created\u000a      by statute \"Trinder suggests that research indicates early or\u000a        pre-existing parent or family characteristics predict subsequent\u000a        pathways and outcomes. [footnote to Trinder 2010a] Co-operative parents\u000a        tend to develop flexible shared care arrangements with positive\u000a        outcomes. High conflict parents tend to develop rigid arrangements,\u000a        often through litigation, that are associated with poorer child\u000a        adjustment and lower levels of child satisfaction. It appears that if\u000a        parents share parental care fully before separation, they are more\u000a        likely to do so successfully after separation. The panel sees\u000a          that there are limits as to what legislation can achieve if\u000a        this approach to parenting is not taken prior to separation.\" (at\u000a      para 5.73, emphasis added). The Final Report2 of the FJR\u000a      reiterated the recommendation against a time-based presumption.\u000a      Trinder's CFLQ findings were summarised and directly cited again at para\u000a      4.19 alongside a verbatim excerpt from Trinder's written submission at\u000a      para 4.24. Under pressure from fathers groups, the Government rejected the\u000a      FJR's recommendation against a new presumption. However, whilst the\u000a      Government is still planning to introduce a presumption about continuing\u000a      parental \"involvement\", it accepted the arguments set out in the FJR\u000a      against a time-based presumption. The influence of Trinder's work in\u000a      bringing to the attention of policy-makers the relevance of the Australian\u000a      experience and the importance of quality rather than quantity is evident\u000a      in para 62 of the Government's response to the FJR3 \"The\u000a        Government is mindful of the lessons which must be learnt from the\u000a        Australian experience of legislating in this area, which were\u000a        highlighted by the Review and led them to urge caution. We will\u000a        therefore consider very carefully how legislation can be framed to avoid\u000a        the pitfalls of the Australian experience, in particular that a\u000a        meaningful relationship is not about equal division of time, but the\u000a        quality of parenting received by the child\".\u000a    PIPs: Trinder's evaluation study of PIPs has been highly\u000a      influential in shaping government policy on the availability and\u000a      content of these programmes. The eight main recommendations of Trinder's\u000a      2011 study, including the need for voluntary self-referral, more effective\u000a      and systematic screening; clearer aims and more focus on skills\u000a      development and the need for a suite of programmes, were reproduced\u000a      verbatim in the Final Report2 of the FJR in November 2011\u000a      (paras 4.87-4.90). The FJR report noted that the recommendations were\u000a      being considered by government (at para 4.88), but also added its own\u000a      strong endorsement \"These recommendations warrant careful consideration\u000a        by government\" at para 4.89. The Government's Response3\u000a      to the FJR in February 2012 accepted all the Trinder\/FJR recommendations\u000a      on PIP, quoting Trinder's evaluation as evidence for the use of PIP as a\u000a      pre-court or alternative to court option \"Evaluation evidence suggests\u000a        that the programme enables parents to better understand and discuss the\u000a        issues they have; and that PIPs work best when parents participate early\u000a        in the dispute resolution process (rather than when proceedings have\u000a        progressed further in the courts). PIPs are not currently available to\u000a        parents until their dispute reaches the court stage. The Government will\u000a        consider how to make such programmes available to parents as part of\u000a        pre-court dispute resolution processes\" (at p74). The government\u000a      also accepted the FJR recommendation that judges should continue to be\u000a      able to refer parties to PIP, again quoting the Trinder evaluation in\u000a      support \"The Government accepts this recommendation. Research has shown\u000a        the Parenting Information Programmes have been valuable to parties to a\u000a        court case at all stages of their dispute and the Government agrees that\u000a        judges should retain the power to order parents to attend these courses\u000a        where the judge feels that it is appropriate\" (at p74). As a result\u000a      of these recommendations there have been a number of further developments:\u000a      (a) the PIP programme is now being made available to parents on a\u000a      self-referral basis rather than being restricted to litigants10;\u000a      (b) the number of court referrals to PIP has risen. The 2011\/12 Cafcass\u000a      Annual Report at p19 (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1b1tlOu)\u000a      reports that 18,279 adults attended PIP in 2011-12 compared to 13,000 in\u000a      2010-11. The cost was &#163;2.83 million; (c) Trinder's recommendations also\u000a      led to the development in four pilot areas of an expanded PIP known as PIP\u000a      Plus incorporating the 2011 evaluation recommendations for a more\u000a      behaviourally-informed programme and better integration between education\u000a      programme, mediation and court. Trinder was commissioned by DfE to\u000a      evaluate the new programme with funding of &#163;99,000 for 2012\/13.\u000a    Enforcement: Trinder's research has been instrumental in\u000a        diverting the government from introducing further punitive sanctions\u000a      and towards exploration of an enforcement-specific parent education\u000a      programme. Trinder held two telephone briefings about the emerging\u000a      findings with the responsible MoJ civil servants4 between\u000a      November and February 2012. Trinder emphasised that few cases appeared to\u000a      be classic implacably hostile parents requiring punitive sanctions, rather\u000a      courts needed more educational\/therapeutic options to address conflict. In\u000a      February 2013 the government dropped its proposal for further sanctions.5\u000a      On 13th April Trinder submitted an interim written briefing\u000a      paper to MoJ, at their request, based on analysis of nearly half the\u000a      target sample of cases. The paper reiterated the findings on case type and\u000a      the need for educational\/therapeutic rather than punitive interventions.\u000a      The briefing was cited as support for the government's new policy\u000a      direction by the Children's Minister during the House of Commons Committee\u000a      stage of the Children and Families Bill on 14th April \"the\u000a        Government's decision not to introduce further new sanctions is\u000a        consistent with their interim findings on the enforcement work they have\u000a        researched. They also conclude that the Government's proposal to develop\u000a        an enforcement-specific case assessment and intervention pathway is a\u000a        positive step forward.... they demonstrate that we have taken a mature\u000a        approach to resolving the problem of enforcement.\"6 MoJ\u000a      and Cafcass are now discussing an enforcement-specific parenting programme\u000a      or `e-PIP' as a direct response to Trinder's recommendations.4, 10\u000a    (ii) Impact on public debate\u000a    Trinder has been a leading figure in the national debate on the\u000a      shared care issue, arguing against amending the Children Act 1989. In\u000a      February 2012, The Guardian published an article by Trinder\u000a      critical of the government's decision to reject the FJR's recommendation\u000a      for no new presumption (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1b1cwDr);\u000a      the article generated 464 comments on The Guardian website.\u000a      Trinder debated the issue with the Children's Minister, Tim Loughton, on\u000a      Radio 4's Today programme on 13th June 2012 (http:\/\/bbc.in\/1iIu7T1),\u000a      was guest contributor on Radio 5 Live's Your Call on the same day\u000a      and was quoted at length on the BBC website (http:\/\/bbc.in\/1iIuixN).\u000a    (iii) Informing professional decision-making\u000a    Trinder has been an invited speaker at a series of meetings and\u000a      presentations involving researchers, policy-makers and practitioners. She\u000a      was invited to present her research on shared care drawing on the 2010\u000a      CFLQ paper at the Judicial College on eight separate occasions between\u000a      November 2010 and February 2012 to audiences of 20-30 District and Circuit\u000a      judges each time. The course evaluations included comments such as \"Very\u000a        thought-provoking about effects of shared residence in practice. Good\u000a        opportunity for discussion\". In February 2012 the Course Director\u000a      HHJ Sally Williams specifically directed family judges to Trinder's\u000a      presentation (uploaded on the Judicial College website) in an Editorial in\u000a      the Judicial College Family E-letter7. The purpose of the\u000a      E-letter is to \"alert family judges, both full-time and part-time, to\u000a      those cases and pieces of legislation that are relevant to everyday\u000a      practice and likely to affect what they do in court\". The E-letter is sent\u000a      to all family judges in England and Wales.\u000a    Trinder also presented her research on PIPs to the Judicial College on\u000a      two occasions, again to groups of 20-30 District and Circuit Judges. Her\u000a      widely distributed briefing on enforcement (Trinder 2013) generated an\u000a      unsolicited email from a leading High Court Judge who commented that \"It\u000a      is extremely interesting and immensely useful\".8\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Three studies by Trinder have helped shape national policy and informed\u000a        practice on three related issues regarding arrangements for children\u000a      after parental separation.

However, achieving this\u000a      level of cooperation poses significant challenges for individual parents\u000a      as well as for the state and family justice system. Since joining the\u000a      University of Exeter's Law School as Professor of Socio-legal Studies in\u000a      September 2009 Trinder has undertaken three complementary studies\u000a      addressing how the legal and policy framework regulating post-separation\u000a      parenting might better support cooperative relationships.\u000a    The first study (Trinder 2010a,b) explored whether or not there should be\u000a      a statutory presumption of shared time (alternatively called `shared care'\u000a      or `shared residence'), whereby children spend roughly equal amounts of\u000a      time with each parent post-separation. The study, in the summer of 2010,\u000a      was a desk-based review of research into shared care arrangements for\u000a      children. Trinder's review was the first to appraise and synthesize the\u000a      findings of a large body of international research, with a particular\u000a      focus on recent large-scale Australian studies, and to consider the\u000a      implications for policy and practice in England and Wales. Key findings\u000a      included establishing that the quality of the relationship between parent\u000a      and child, rather than simply the amount of contact between them, was the\u000a      crucial factor in improving outcomes for children; identifying major risk\u000a      factors in practices such as regular overnight stays for children under\u000a      four; and showing that a statutory presumption could have the unintended\u000a      consequence of expanding shared care amongst high conflict parents where\u000a      shared time is associated with poorer outcomes.\u000a    The second study explored the effectiveness of a new parent education\u000a      programme designed as a tool to facilitate contact and cooperative\u000a      parenting. Education programmes for separated parents are used extensively\u000a      overseas, but a power to enable courts to refer litigating parents to a\u000a      programme was only introduced in England and Wales under the 2006 Children\u000a      and Adoption Act. In early 2011 Trinder led a multi-disciplinary team\u000a      commissioned by the Department of Education (DfE) at a cost of &#163;140,000 to\u000a      undertake the first national evaluation of Parenting Information Programme\u000a      (PIPs). This major study included a telephone survey of 600 PIP and\u000a      non-PIP attendees and qualitative interviews and focus groups with\u000a      parents, lawyers and mediators. It found that parents and professionals\u000a      were very positive about the aims, content and delivery of the programmes,\u000a      and that PIP attendance had a modest impact on the number of children\u000a      having contact (Trinder et al 2011, Smith &amp; Trinder 2012). However\u000a      there was no reduction in costs, conflict or subsequent court action\u000a      compared with those who did not attend PIPs. To address this, the\u000a      researchers made a range of recommendations about the content and\u000a      availability of the programme, including extending the programme to\u000a      parents before they reached the stage of going to court; including a\u000a      specific behavioural skills element within the syllabus; and more\u000a      effective linkage between educational and dispute-resolution elements of\u000a      the programme.\u000a    The third study examined the very difficult problem of cases where one\u000a      parent is reported to be in breach of a court order for contact. The 2006\u000a      Children and Adoption Act enabled courts to order a parent to undertake\u000a      community service for breaching a court order. However, this new\u000a      enforcement sanction has been rarely used. In mid 2012 the Government\u000a      suggested that a tougher approach was needed and announced a consultation\u000a      on further sanctions. There was, however, no existing research on the\u000a      nature and extent of non-compliance, nor why courts were avoiding using\u000a      the existing sanctions. Trinder therefore sought funding of &#163;71,000 from\u000a      the Nuffield Foundation to examine how courts approached enforcement\u000a      cases. This study was based on file analysis of a national sample of all\u000a      215 enforcement applications made in a two month period in 2012. It used\u000a      the electronic case records held by the Children and Family Courts\u000a      Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass). Trinder was the first external\u000a      researcher to be given access to these records. The study found that the\u000a      popular stereotype of the implacably hostile mother was misleading; most\u000a      enforcement cases involved mutual parental hostility, safeguarding issues\u000a      or teenagers refusing contact; courts typically used punitive approaches\u000a      when they were appropriate; sufficient punitive sanctions existed but\u000a      courts needed a wider range of educational and therapeutic tools to help\u000a      both parents implement orders effectively (Trinder 2013, Trinder et al\u000a      2013).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23969","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    ESYTC has had an impact in two main ways:\u000a    a. Providing the evidence base for the Scottish Government's reforms\u000a        to youth justice and thereby supporting reductions in offending\u000a    The findings on the effectiveness of policing and youth-justice\u000a      interventions (McAra and McVie 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4) formed the evidence\u000a      base for the Scottish Government's recent reforms to youth justice,\u000a      including the Early and Effective Intervention Programme for under 16s and\u000a      the Whole System Approach for under 18s. The Whole System Approach, in\u000a      particular, was developed to deal with high-risk young people involved in\u000a      offending and represents a major shift away from punitive measures towards\u000a      maximum use of diversion, a key focus being to keep 16 and 17 year-olds\u000a      out of the criminal justice system. The Whole System Approach has been\u000a      promulgated by the Scottish Government as \"an effective way of working\"\u000a      because it is underpinned by the ESYTC evidence that intensive\u000a      system-contact can have detrimental consequences for offending behaviour\u000a      and longer-term life chances (5.5).\u000a    The Early and Effective Intervention Programme has now been rolled out\u000a      nationally. The Whole System Approach was piloted by Northern Community\u000a      Justice Authority in 2010 and, on the basis of positive early evaluation,\u000a      was rolled out nationally to all 32 Local Authorities in September 2011,\u000a      along with guidance that draws heavily on ESYTC findings. All but two\u000a      Local Authorities in Scotland are currently signed up to adopting the WSA\u000a      (5.4).\u000a    These measures resulted in major and significant reductions in offence\u000a      referrals to the Scottish juvenile justice system. According to Daniel\u000a      Kleinberg, Ex-Head of Youth Justice in Scottish Government:\u000a    The following statistics are evidence of some of the success seen in\u000a      action on the insights contained within the Edinburgh Study &#8212;\u000a    \u000a      Nationally, since 2007\/8 offence referrals to the children's reporter\u000a        have fallen by 66%, from 16, 490 to 5,604 in 2011\/12, with a 31%\u000a        reduction from 2010\/11 to 2011\/12.\u000a      Since 2008-9 the Policing Performance Framework has collected data on\u000a        youth crime: the number of recorded crimes and offences committed by\u000a        children and young people (8-17 year olds) decreased by 32% between\u000a        2008-09 and 2011-12. The number of children and young people (8-17) who\u000a        committed crimes and offences decreased by 9% between 2010-11 and\u000a        2011-12. (5.2)\u000a    \u000a    The longer-term implications have been confirmed by Kenny MacAskill,\u000a      Cabinet Secretary for Justice: `The work they [McAra and McVie] have done\u000a      on the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime has been important\u000a      in providing the underpinning evidence for the approach this Government\u000a      has taken to youth justice issues. The more we resort to formal measures\u000a      in dealing with children, the greater the risk we draw them further into\u000a      the system. So we need to use those measures very carefully, and in a way\u000a      that tackles the needs, not merely the deeds, of all young people who\u000a      offend.' (5.3)\u000a    Confirming the `significant impact' that the work of McAra and McVie has\u000a      had on the 2005-2010 Labour and 2010- Coalition governments in England and\u000a      Wales, as developed by the Youth Justice Board (YJB), ex-Chief Executive\u000a      of the YJB, John Drew, has stated: `...the Edinburgh study is the most\u000a      significant large scale piece of research in this area undertaken in the\u000a      last several decades and needs careful review by all policy makers and\u000a      practitioners working in this area.'

(2010). This report examined proposals\u000a      for reform to the youth justice system via the Children's Hearings\u000a      (Scotland) Bill. It stated: `The [Edinburgh] Study offers a huge amount of\u000a      information and analyses on the lives and fortunes of these children and\u000a      the connections between socio-economic circumstances, parenting,\u000a      interventions, school exclusions and crime. This should be of immense\u000a      interest and use to government, councils and panels in shaping the\u000a      services needed and avoiding the mistakes of the past.'

Established in 1997 under the leadership of David J Smith\u000a      (Edinburgh 1994-2004) and Lesley McAra (appointed in Edinburgh 1995), and\u000a      managed throughout by Susan McVie (appointed in Edinburgh 1998), ESYTC is\u000a      one of the largest single-age cohort studies of its kind in the world and\u000a      is one of a small number of studies in this field that have been\u000a      influential worldwide. The study is innovative in its design in terms of\u000a      breadth of coverage (using a census approach to maximise inclusion),\u000a      complexity of data management (including development of multiple\u000a      datasets), and extent of data linkage (combining data from surveys with\u000a      various administrative sources). Data collection has included six annual\u000a      sweeps of self-report surveys from cohort members (age 12-17); official\u000a      records from police, social work, children's hearings, schools and\u000a      criminal convictions records; surveys of parents and teachers; a community\u000a      survey; and compilation of a Geographic Information System incorporating\u000a      census and police-recorded crime data. A follow-up self-report survey\u000a      sweep (age 24\/25) was recently completed for a sub-sample of the original\u000a      cohort.\u000a    The research has been guided by an expert Advisory Group (chaired by\u000a      Professor Sir Michael Rutter), including senior academics and\u000a      representatives from Scottish Government, Lothian and Borders Police, City\u000a      of Edinburgh Council Social Work and Education Departments, Scottish\u000a      Children's Reporter Administration, Scottish Prison Service, Crown Office\u000a      and Procurator Fiscal Service, and several voluntary bodies that work with\u000a      young people. These organisations have contributed to the research in\u000a      terms of facilitating access and advising the research team; and benefited\u000a      from it through receiving research briefings, bespoke seminars and\u000a      presentations, direct dialogue and advice on policy and practice. ESYTC\u000a      has an exceptionally strong public-policy focus across the UK, as\u000a      evidenced by close working relationships with policy-makers and\u000a      practitioners through activities such as: direct engagement with\u000a      politicians; expert testimony; advisory and awareness-raising activities;\u000a      and KE events for central and local government and other organisations.\u000a      The success of the research has been facilitated by the marriage of\u000a      McAra's theoretical insights with McVie's advanced quantitative expertise,\u000a      both often drawing from disciplines outside criminology, to generate new\u000a      understanding about youth offending.\u000a    The high quality of the ESYTC research has been enhanced by linking\u000a      self-report offending data with official data on both juvenile and adult\u000a      criminal-justice processes.

The ILC's work is generally regarded as highly authoritative by\u000a      governments and international courts, and is used by lawyers and\u000a      governments to influence judicial decisions. The second edition of Boyle's\u000a      monograph was cited extensively in its Report of 58th session (2006) (GAOR\u000a      A\/61\/10, pp.113ff). Critically, the ILC rethought its original findings.\u000a      Its final codifications (2001 and 2006) fully reflected the paradigm\u000a      advocated by Boyle's research.\u000a    As a result of Boyle's research being taken up by legal institutions his\u000a      work has had an impact on law and practice during the REF2014 period\u000a      because his analytical framework has been successfully channelled into the\u000a      international court arena and, in turn, adopted as the paradigm for the\u000a      evolving subject of international environmental law.\u000a    \u000a      The International Court of Justice's (ICJ) judgment in Pulp Mills\u000a        (2010) is the first decision of any international court to address the\u000a        core concepts of international environmental law. It deals with the\u000a        regulation of trans-boundary pollution and environmental impacts. Boyle\u000a        was counsel for Uruguay and based his written pleadings and oral\u000a        arguments mainly on material drawn from Chapter 3 of the (then\u000a        forthcoming) 3rd edition of his book &#8212; embodying the above research\u000a        findings. The ICJ judgment for Uruguay closely mirrors the analysis in\u000a        that chapter. Moreover, the work is cited expressly in the separate\u000a        opinion of Judge (Trindade): `...while a great part of that writing\u000a        continues, somewhat hesitantly, to refer to sustainable development as a\u000a        \"concept\", there are also those who seem today to display their\u000a        preparedness and open-mindedness to admit that it has turned out to be a\u000a        general principle of International Environmental Law'. [referencing\u000a        Boyle and Birnie] (5.3)\u000a      The Advisory Opinion on the Responsibilities of States with respect to\u000a        Activities in the Deep Seabed Area (International Tribunal on the Law of\u000a        the Sea (ITLOS) 2011) (5.4), builds on the judgment given in the Pulp\u000a          Mills Case (5.2), and again confirms the analysis advanced by\u000a        Boyle in Chapter 3 of the 2009 edition of International Law and the\u000a          Environment.\u000a    \u000a    The key findings of each court that support both the general\u000a      international law nature and preventative\/precautionary themes of Boyle's\u000a      analysis are:\u000a    i. The ICJ confirms explicitly in Pulp Mills that in\u000a      international law governments must regulate and control trans-boundary\u000a      pollution to the highest applicable international standards (para 187).\u000a      See also ITLOS (para 111).\u000a    ii. Pulp Mills is the first occasion in which an international\u000a      court has held that prior assessment of trans-boundary environmental\u000a      impacts (EIA) is a requirement of general international law (para 204). It\u000a      is also the first occasion when any international court has considered the\u000a      specific requirements of an EIA.\u000a    iii. Both courts accept that governments must take a precautionary\u000a      approach to environmental risk management, but this does not operate as a\u000a      reversal of the burden of proof (Pulp Mills at para 164; ITLOS at\u000a      para 131).\u000a    Confirming Boyle's pivotal role, Sir Michael Wood, Member of the\u000a      International Law Commission, has said: `The International Court of\u000a      Justice in The Hague (which tends not to cite authors by name in its\u000a      judgments) has largely adopted his pragmatic approach, including in its\u000a      most recent judgment dealing with environmental matters, Pulp\u000a      Mills...(2010). Likewise, Professor Boyle's writings were cited in 2009 by\u000a      a number of the participants (including by me acting as Counsel for the\u000a      United Kingdom) before International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in\u000a      Hamburg (established by the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention), in the\u000a      proceedings leading up to its first ever Advisory Opinion\u000a      (Responsibilities and Obligations of States Sponsoring Persons and\u000a      Entities with Respect to Activities in the Area). This seminal Advisory\u000a      Opinion follows the Pulp Mills judgment, and thus we have the beginning of\u000a      a solid case-law on the subjects such as environmental impact assessments\u000a      and the precautionary principle\/approach'. (5.5)\u000a    The impact is reflected in the following honour citation: `The Jury has\u000a      decided to award the 2011 Elizabeth Haub Prize for Environmental Law to\u000a      Professor Alan Boyle in recognition of his exceptional accomplishments in\u000a      international environmental law. In reaching its decision, the jury has\u000a      noted that through his pioneering and outstanding scholarly works\u000a      Professor Boyle has played an important role in structuring and theorizing\u000a      this new field of international law.

Historically, few legal academics gave much thought to\u000a      the problem of protecting the environment. Sceptics argued that the\u000a      subject was `soft' in character, lacking sufficiently widespread support\u000a      to generate binding rules of general international law. They believed that\u000a      relevant issues could be addressed by developing the law on responsibility\u000a      for trans-boundary damage. This was also the perspective adopted by the\u000a      United Nations International Law Commission (ILC) in its early work on\u000a      international environmental law.\u000a    Through his collaboration with Patricia Birnie from LSE (and later,\u000a      Catherine Redgwell at UCL), Boyle (appointed to Edinburgh in 1995)\u000a      challenged these positions as, at best, a questionable exercise in\u000a      reconceptualising an existing body of law, at worst, a retrograde step\u000a      which might weaken international efforts to secure agreement on effective\u000a      principles of international environmental law. Boyle was one of the\u000a      primary architects of the international environmental law as it is now\u000a      understood. The research was disseminated primarily through book chapters,\u000a      journal articles, and three editions of a seminal book, International\u000a        Law and the Environment. Boyle contributed 70% of all three editions\u000a      of the core text, the later editions of which, in 2002 and 2009, framed\u000a      the field as a legal discipline in its own right. The second edition (3.1)\u000a      was significantly expanded with new research to deal with the surge of\u000a      law-making in the field resulting from the major 1992 Rio Conference on\u000a      Environment and Development. The third edition was published in 2009\u000a      (3.2). Chapters 3-5, in particular, were substantially rewritten to take\u000a      account of burgeoning case law on trans-boundary environmental disputes\u000a      and the scope of overlap with human rights law. All three chapters were\u000a      written by Boyle.\u000a    Boyle's distinctive scholarship pushes the boundaries beyond existing law\u000a      to ask how international environmental law actually works &#8212; and\u000a      sometimes does not work. While other scholars proposed narrow theoretical\u000a      frameworks for the development of international environmental law as a\u000a      distinct subject area &#8212; for example, human rights approach,\u000a      intergenerational approach, policy-oriented approach &#8212; Birnie and Boyle\u000a      argued that:\u000a    \u000a      None of these frameworks in isolation provides an adequate\u000a        architecture for international environmental law, particularly against\u000a        the proliferation of international environmental litigation in the last\u000a        few decades.\u000a      International legal obligations in the environmental sphere stem from\u000a        general principles of international law and not only from specific\u000a        Treaty-set obligations.\u000a      Having started as a system of rules limited largely to liability for\u000a        trans-boundary damage, resource allocation, and the resolution of\u000a        conflicting uses of common spaces, international environmental law\u000a        should take a preventive and precautionary approach to the protection of\u000a        the environment.\u000a      Much greater emphasis should be placed on regulation and control of\u000a        environmental nuisances by governments.\u000a      Less prominence should be given to liability for damage as law's main\u000a        response to environmentally harmful activities.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23971","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The series of international workshops held by the Co-Investigators in\u000a      collaboration with the Argentinian Ministry of Science, Technology and\u000a      Innovative Production (MOST) served as both research method and\u000a      impact-generator and resulted in more open debate than had previously been\u000a      achieved in Argentina. These meetings were led by Arzuaga, who was\u000a      appointed an Edinburgh AHRC SCRIPT Centre Fellow (2006-) and subsequently\u000a      appointed Chair of the Argentinian Advisory Commission on Regenerative\u000a      Medicine and Cellular Therapies (2008). Research beneficiaries included\u000a      the MOST, select Argentine policy and science elites (legislators,\u000a      regulators, policymakers, key members of the life sciences, law and\u000a      bioethics academic communities), and invited UK experts.\u000a    The impact of the research is that, through the systematic engagement of\u000a      the research community and law and policy makers, the partnership between\u000a      the University of Edinburgh, on one side, and Argentinian research\u000a      regulators, on the other, overcame a long-standing impasse in Argentina\u000a      with respect to state non-intervention in the regulation of regenerative\u000a      medicine. There had previously been no thorough consideration of\u000a      appropriate regulatory models for Argentina to promote research in this\u000a      emerging field. More specifically, the iterative engagement and associated\u000a      findings led to:\u000a    \u000a      Influence on the annual agendas of the Advisory Commission on\u000a        Regenerative Medicine &amp; Cellular Therapies.

According to its Chair, Dr Fabiana Arzuaga: `This\u000a        research served to inform and shape crucial steps in Argentina towards\u000a        the construction of a legal framework and regulatory policies and action\u000a        for stem cells research and therapies, which led to a proposal to modify\u000a        the Civil Code of Argentina' (5.2).\u000a      Exposure of the reasons behind scientific and regulatory caution, as\u000a        well as uncertainty of having a `legal blank page'. Importantly, this\u000a        included an appetite for top-down regulation in Argentina. The research\u000a        provided regulators with evidence that stakeholders desired central\u000a        normative guidance and oversight, a finding subsequently confirmed by a\u000a        national survey (5.7). Recommendations about the need for a central\u000a        regulatory authority form a central part of the new model law.\u000a      Mobilisation of a close network of Argentine and UK researchers and\u000a        regulators which permitted swifter and more dramatic policy movement\u000a        than had previously been experienced in Argentine science governance.\u000a        The research did not just study key Argentine stakeholders, it brought\u000a        diverse interested groups together, helping to forge relationships\u000a        across user communities and fashion a more supportive environment in a\u000a        morally contentious area. Dr Florencia Luna, bioethics member of the\u000a        MOST, stated: `...the project has shown extraordinary results like\u000a        creating engagement with law\/policy, medical and scientific\u000a        communities...and facilitated an unprecedented consideration of\u000a        regulatory options' (5.4).\u000a      Facilitation and contribution to both the generation of law and the\u000a        design and uptake of new models for performing regulation.

The fourth (2010) examined\u000a      biobanks and the regulation of human tissues and cells, and the fifth\u000a      (2011) was a comparative exploration of the regulation of advanced\u000a      medicinal products. Parallel semi-structured qualitative interviews were\u000a      conducted with key stakeholders. Data and recommendations were\u000a      disseminated in reports and policy briefs and considered by the Ministers\u000a      of Science and Health and by representatives of INCUCAI (Argentine human\u000a      transplantation authority) and ANMAT (Argentine medicines and medical\u000a      devices regulator). All parties took part in the iterative process of\u000a      research design and the production of key findings.\u000a    The research revealed a regulatory environment that was not operating\u000a      optimally, and indeed was not operating as it was perceived to do by\u000a      different groups of stakeholders:\u000a    \u000a      existing legal mechanisms did not adequately reflect common values\u000a        deemed essential by key players in the research and regulatory\u000a        environments;\u000a      there was a strong conviction that regulation must be more proactive\u000a        and grounded on more effective stakeholder interaction;\u000a      the aspirations for regulation were diverse, but included a desire for\u000a        top-down value-informed normative rules, reflective of transparency,\u000a        honesty, democracy (from a procedural perspective) and knowledge,\u000a        solidarity, equality (from a substantive perspective).\u000a    \u000a    Accordingly, the research outputs argued that:\u000a    \u000a      regulation must better reflect the moral foundations of life science\u000a        practices (3.1);\u000a      better evidence from society must undergird regulatory design to\u000a        operationalise socio-moral values (3.2);\u000a      regulatory frameworks must place greater emphasis on identifying and\u000a        realising positive social outcomes for emerging technologies (3.1 and\u000a        3.5);\u000a      while individual choice and protecting individual integrity are\u000a        important, more emphasis should be given to community and the virtues\u000a        that support solidaristic outcomes (3.3 and 3.4); and\u000a      an overt commitment to appropriate legal regulation is defensible and\u000a        necessary in Argentina (3.2 and 3.5).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23972","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research findings were used by Laurie to design, test and implement\u000d\u000a      the Good Governance\u000d\u000a      Framework (GGF) for SHIP. This is based on a series of principles and\u000d\u000a      instances of best practice.\u000d\u000a      The GGF was successfully launched in 2012.\u000d\u000a    The principal users of the GGF are: (i) custodians of health data, such\u000d\u000a      as NHS Scotland, National\u000d\u000a      Records Scotland (NRS), and Caldicott Guardians with special remit for\u000d\u000a      patient confidential data,\u000d\u000a      and (ii) medical and statistical researchers seeking to link data. All\u000d\u000a      were involved in the design of\u000d\u000a      the GGF. Accordingly, the impact can be considered (1) at the level of the\u000d\u000a      governance community,\u000d\u000a      and (2) at the level of the researcher community (5.1, 5.2 and 5.3). A\u000d\u000a      central feature of the claim to\u000d\u000a      impact has been success in overcoming a prevailing `culture of caution'\u000d\u000a      concerning data linkages.\u000d\u000a    There are three elements to impact.\u000d\u000a    (1) Impact on the governance community\u000d\u000a    Laurie was uniquely placed to act as a conduit between the academy and\u000d\u000a      the governance\u000d\u000a      environment because of his position as Chair of the Privacy Advisory\u000d\u000a      Committee (2005-2013)\u000d\u000a      (5.7). Scottish Chief Scientist (Health), Professor Andrew Morris, has\u000d\u000a      said: `In concrete terms,\u000d\u000a      Laurie's research since 2009 led to the adoption of entirely novel\u000d\u000a      proportionate governance\u000d\u000a      mechanisms by key data linkage decision-making bodies within Scotland,\u000d\u000a      such as the Privacy\u000d\u000a      Advisory Committee which acts as sole advisor to NHS National Services\u000d\u000a      Scotland and National\u000d\u000a      Records of Scotland &#8212; two of the largest and most influential data\u000d\u000a      custodians in the country. This\u000d\u000a      has resulted not only in faster turn-around times for linkage approvals,\u000d\u000a      but also to greater\u000d\u000a      transparency and accountability of the governance systems, leading &#8212; we\u000d\u000a      believe &#8212; to more trust in\u000d\u000a      health-related research as a crucial dimension of public benefit and\u000d\u000a      economic growth in Scotland.\u000d\u000a      These changes have been directly instrumental in securing Scotland's\u000d\u000a      position as a Go-To country\u000d\u000a      for safe, secure and effective health-research' (5.1).\u000d\u000a    (2) Impact on the health researcher community\u000d\u000a    The implementation of the SHIP GGF delivers faster, more transparent and\u000d\u000a      consistent access to\u000d\u000a      researchers, within and beyond the NHS. Furthermore, the research\u000d\u000a      identified an unmet need for\u000d\u000a      training on the legal, ethical and governance issues related to data\u000d\u000a      sharing in medical research.\u000d\u000a      This resulted in the design and delivery of an online training module to\u000d\u000a      accredited researchers to\u000d\u000a      use SHIP. This was piloted by Laurie and Sethi with twenty members of the\u000d\u000a      active research\u000d\u000a      community in March 2012 and launched in the same year. It has since\u000d\u000a      accredited 56 researchers\u000d\u000a      (5.8 and 5.9).\u000d\u000a    Dr Hester Ward, Medical Director in NHS Scotland National Services said:\u000d\u000a      `The online SHIP\u000d\u000a      Information Governance Training Course, which was developed by Professor\u000d\u000a      Laurie and\u000d\u000a      colleagues, has become integral to the process of becoming a \"SHIP\u000d\u000a      approved researcher\".\u000d\u000a      Completion of this course helps NSS to ensure that only \"safe people\" who\u000d\u000a      have been trained\u000d\u000a      appropriately and understand their legal obligations, gain access to\u000d\u000a      sensitive information.\u000d\u000a      Professor Laurie's work has helped NSS to both develop our information\u000d\u000a      governance processes\u000d\u000a      and ensure that researchers are aware of their legal obligations. These\u000d\u000a      contributions have had a\u000d\u000a      significant impact on making sure that research, which is in the public\u000d\u000a      interest takes place, whilst\u000d\u000a      also ensuring the ongoing maintenance of the privacy of citizens'\u000d\u000a      information' (5.2). Since\u000d\u000a      deployment of the GGF and to 31 July 2013, NHS Scotland National Services\u000d\u000a      had received 344\u000d\u000a      applications for data linkage to be subject to the GGF proportionate\u000d\u000a      approach.\u000d\u000a    (3) Impact beyond the health sector\u000d\u000a    The GGF has been recognised for its transferable value as a model to\u000d\u000a      promote data linkage and\u000d\u000a      key features have been taken up outside the health sector. The Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government public\u000d\u000a      consultation on a proposal for a National Data Linkage Centre focused on\u000d\u000a      the founding principles\u000d\u000a      for the Centre. These were directly taken and adapted from the Principles\u000d\u000a      and Best Practices\u000d\u000a      developed by Laurie (5.4, 5.5, and 5.6).\u000d\u000a    According to Dr Sara Grainger, Head of Statistics Policy, Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government: `The arguments\u000d\u000a      set out by Professor Laurie and colleagues in the SHIP Working Papers on\u000d\u000a      Good Governance\u000d\u000a      formed a crucial part of the evidence-base used in developing Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government policy on data\u000d\u000a      access and analysis, published in November 2012 as \"Joined Up Data for\u000d\u000a      Better Decisions\". The\u000d\u000a      specific influence can be seen in what is now Scottish Government policy\u000d\u000a      to encourage all public\u000d\u000a      bodies to a) adopt a more proportionate approach to managing the risks\u000d\u000a      associated with data\u000d\u000a      sharing and linkage and b) place more emphasis on safe people and safe\u000d\u000a      environments, rather\u000d\u000a      than over-reliance on consent and anonymisation (safe data)' (5.3).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research on health information governance conducted by Laurie (2009-2013)\u000d\u000a      resulted in a\u000d\u000a      transformed and streamlined regulatory environment across Scotland through\u000d\u000a      design and\u000d\u000a      implementation of a state-of-the-art good governance framework for the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Health\u000d\u000a      Informatics Programme (SHIP).

It confronts the pre-existing\u000d\u000a      paradigm of `consent or\u000d\u000a      anonymise' applied to research on patient data and tissues, demonstrating\u000d\u000a      that this approach is\u000d\u000a      neither necessary nor sufficient in a robust governance framework that\u000d\u000a      promotes responsible data\u000d\u000a      linkage under a well-defined public interest mandate.\u000d\u000a    These research findings stem from two overlapping projects on which\u000d\u000a      Laurie served as legal lead\u000d\u000a      and Co-Investigator responsible for information governance dimensions\u000d\u000a      (2009-2013, section 3).\u000d\u000a      The Scottish Health Informatics Programme (SHIP) built a world-leading and\u000d\u000a      state-of-the-art\u000d\u000a      infrastructure to facilitate the use of health-related records in medical\u000d\u000a      research through an\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinary collaboration involving the Universities of Dundee,\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh, Glasgow and St\u000d\u000a      Andrews, NHS Scotland and National Records Scotland.

The core message he\u000d\u000a      conveyed was the\u000d\u000a      importance of effective enforcement, which implied the need for a shift in\u000d\u000a      emphasis from\u000d\u000a      criminalisation to confiscation among institutions and state actors.\u000d\u000a      Importantly, the work on the\u000d\u000a      Warsaw Convention &#8212; which reinforced the original Convention provisions on\u000d\u000a      money laundering\u000d\u000a      and the confiscation of criminal proceeds to achieve greater effect in\u000d\u000a      practice &#8212; endorsed\u000d\u000a      Gilmore's conclusions developed in the second edition of Dirty Money.\u000d\u000a      These conclusions were\u000d\u000a      confirmed in Gilmore's MONEYVAL-commissioned `horizontal' study of country\u000d\u000a      reports examining\u000d\u000a      peer-review evaluation on compliance, required by the FATF (2006-7): the\u000d\u000a      system was not\u000d\u000a      working (5.1). These steps served as the platform for the impact during\u000d\u000a      the REF period, which\u000d\u000a      involved two important contributions.\u000d\u000a    1. Gilmore's discussions with the then Head of the Dutch delegation to\u000d\u000a      FATF, Andrew Strijker, led\u000d\u000a      directly to the shaping of the Dutch FATF presidency agenda for 2009-2010,\u000d\u000a      in meetings from\u000d\u000a      November 2007 onwards. Regarding Gilmore's input, Mr Strijker has said\u000d\u000a      that: `...his authorship of\u000d\u000a      \"Dirty Money\" that has a broad audience, his horizontal review of country\u000d\u000a      assessments and\u000d\u000a      `lessons learned' from international practice, and his role as scientific\u000d\u000a      expert for MONEYVAL,\u000d\u000a      acted as the major trigger to draw from his experience'. Moreover,\u000d\u000a      `...those first discussions with\u000d\u000a      Professor Gilmore turned out to be rather important when looking at new\u000d\u000a      FATF recommendations\u000d\u000a      of 2012 and the latest FATF work' (5.2).\u000d\u000a    Reflecting the reach of Gilmore's research, the Dutch presidency led a\u000d\u000a      targeted review of FATF\u000d\u000a      standards, a process concluded in February 2012. A Dutch priority, flowing\u000d\u000a      from the early\u000d\u000a      discussions, was significantly to reinforce confiscation methods and to\u000d\u000a      embed this objective in the\u000d\u000a      culture of national enforcement practices. The achievement of this goal is\u000d\u000a      reflected in the adoption\u000d\u000a      of revised, markedly strengthened FATF Recommendations (R30 and R31,\u000d\u000a      replacing former R27\u000d\u000a      and R28), grounded in Gilmore's research conclusions. This is confirmed by\u000d\u000a      John Ringguth,\u000d\u000a      Executive Secretary to MONEYVAL: `[d]uring the review of the FATF\u000d\u000a      standards, begun under the\u000d\u000a      Dutch Presidency, Professor Gilmore encouraged MONEYVAL to promote a\u000d\u000a      global level greater\u000d\u000a      focus on the strengthening of those FATF standards which relate to law\u000d\u000a      enforcement, effective\u000d\u000a      criminalisation of money laundering, and effective confiscation. This\u000d\u000a      advice was followed'. (5.3)\u000d\u000a    2. In its 2008-2009 session, the House of Lords European Union Committee\u000d\u000a      published a report,\u000d\u000a      `Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism', in which Gilmore is\u000d\u000a      acknowledged as its `sole\u000d\u000a      specialist adviser' whose `unrivalled knowledge of the subject and wise\u000d\u000a      guidance [was] invaluable'\u000d\u000a      (p10). This work placed considerable emphasis on confiscation and the need\u000d\u000a      further to enhance\u000d\u000a      cooperation at the international (FATF) and regional (CoE and European\u000d\u000a      Union) levels.\u000d\u000a      MONEYVAL gave evidence acknowledging that `...many of the technical legal\u000d\u000a      problems...have\u000d\u000a      been addressed in the new Warsaw Convention', directly endorsing Gilmour's\u000d\u000a      prior input (p 202).\u000d\u000a      (5.4)\u000d\u000a    The Report strongly supports the work of MONEYVAL and stresses the need\u000d\u000a      for the UK\u000d\u000a      Government to participate in the realisation of FATF enforcement\u000d\u000a      objectives. As summarised in\u000d\u000a      the recommendations: `The review of the FATF Recommendations is a good\u000d\u000a      opportunity to re-\u000d\u000a      examine, not just the text of Recommendation 38, but the manner in which\u000d\u000a      it is implemented, and\u000d\u000a      the way in which compliance is measured.

His research broke new ground as the first monograph to address\u000d\u000a      money laundering\u000d\u000a      through the prism of international law. The research focuses on the\u000d\u000a      regional dimension of\u000d\u000a      international standard-setting, primarily by the Council of Europe (CoE)\u000d\u000a      and its specialised body\u000d\u000a      MONEYVAL, which is dedicated to implementing and monitoring standards and\u000d\u000a      practices. A multi-layered,\u000d\u000a      cooperative system to coordinate state responses to money laundering was\u000d\u000a      already in\u000d\u000a      place under the broad regulatory remit of the Financial Action Task Force\u000d\u000a      (FATF), the global\u000d\u000a      standard-setting body on money laundering. Gilmore's work was the first\u000d\u000a      evaluation of this system\u000d\u000a      and of the standards imposed on states, notably by the CoE's 1990\u000d\u000a      Strasbourg Convention on\u000d\u000a      Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime.\u000d\u000a      This called on\u000d\u000a      contracting states to criminalise money laundering, focusing on formal\u000d\u000a      legal obligations and\u000d\u000a      international cooperation.\u000d\u000a    The second edition of Dirty Money (1999) was a substantially\u000d\u000a      developed project (3.2).

Moreover, tracing these\u000d\u000a      processes had become\u000d\u000a      increasingly complex. Gilmore argued that: (1) governments were focusing\u000d\u000a      overwhelmingly on\u000d\u000a      achieving formal compliance with international standards by criminalising\u000d\u000a      money laundering and\u000d\u000a      associated activities.

In the aftermath of the 9\/11 attacks,\u000d\u000a      development of an effective\u000d\u000a      international strategy to deal with the financing of terrorism was an\u000d\u000a      acute political priority (3.5).\u000d\u000a      Evaluation of peer-reviewed state reports submitted to the FATF revealed\u000d\u000a      little by way of progress\u000d\u000a      on the ground (3.3). Gilmore's analysis was therefore significantly\u000d\u000a      hardened:\u000d\u000a    1. he stressed the need for the inculcation of a culture of effectiveness\u000d\u000a      and enforcement;\u000d\u000a    2. he advocated a deliberate rebalancing of priorities within national\u000d\u000a      laws, away from the dominant\u000d\u000a      focus on criminalisation to dealing also with the enforcement of rules on\u000d\u000a      the tracing, freezing and\u000d\u000a      confiscating of criminal profits.\u000d\u000a    Tellingly, Gilmore highlighted the fact that no FATF evaluation round had\u000d\u000a      undertaken a\u000d\u000a      comprehensive evaluation of national confiscation laws. He concluded that\u000d\u000a      governments had to\u000d\u000a      reconceptualise entirely the nature of the challenge they now faced, but\u000d\u000a      that international\u000d\u000a      cooperation could and should assist them through a recalibration of\u000d\u000a      emphasis within the\u000d\u000a      international regulatory framework.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23974","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    By the time these comments on the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979\u000a      were made, Reid had been appointed a Scottish Law Commissioner, charged\u000a      with directing a major programme of land law reform (now fully implemented\u000a      by legislation). Beginning in 2002 Reid wrote three consultative\u000a      Discussion Papers on land registration; Gretton, who succeeded him as a\u000a      Law Commissioner in 2006, was responsible for the final Report and for\u000a      draft legislation (2010). A Bill based on the Law Commission's draft was\u000a      introduced to Parliament by the Scottish Government in 2011 and was passed\u000a      the following year as the Land Registration etc (Scotland) Act 2012. The\u000a      Act is a substantial piece of legislation comprising 124 sections and five\u000a      schedules. The impact that is claimed is this legal change, being the\u000a      culmination of a programme of reform of property law by the Scottish\u000a      Government (5.1).\u000a    Reid and Gretton's earlier research had pointed to a conceptual flaw at\u000a      the very heart of the 1979 legislation. According to normal principles of\u000a      property law, ownership cannot pass from one person to another without a\u000a      consensual juridical act requiring the participation of both. But while\u000a      that juridical act &#8212; the granting and acceptance of a deed of conveyance &#8212;\u000a      was left undisturbed by the legislation, it had become a meaningless\u000a      formality. For ownership now passed by the act of registration alone and\u000a      without reference to the validity or otherwise of the underlying deed.\u000a      Title, in other words, derived from registration and not to any extent\u000a      from the deed; and in a phrase of Reid's, taken up by the Law Commission,\u000a      the registrar had a `Midas touch': whatever he registered turned to valid.\u000a      Quite apart from its departure from fundamental principles, this Midas\u000a      touch suffered from the same defect as in the myth from which the name\u000a      derived: its inflexible and indiscriminate nature created a valid title\u000a      even in cases &#8212; such as forged deeds &#8212; where validity was plainly the\u000a      `wrong' response.\u000a    Having made this conceptual error, the legislation then sought to\u000a      ameliorate its consequences, Reid and Gretton pointed out, by sometimes\u000a      allowing `rectification' of the Register on grounds of legal (as opposed\u000a      to factual) inaccuracy. But since, due to the Midas touch, an entry on the\u000a      Register could never actually be wrong, legal inaccuracy had to be\u000a      measured by reference, not to land registration law, but to ordinary\u000a      property law. The resulting `bijuralism' &#8212; the simultaneous application of\u000a      two different systems of law &#8212; was clumsy, complex and uncertain\u000a      (especially in relation to later transmissions). It was also, as Reid and\u000a      Gretton demonstrated, unnecessary. Its evident policy aim, of protecting\u000a      acquirers who relied in good faith on the Register, could be achieved by a\u000a      direct rule to that effect. The Midas touch could then be abolished,\u000a      bijuralism discarded, and the normal rules of property law (including\u000a      consensual transfer) restored. The 2012 Act so provides. The result is not\u000a      only simplicity and conceptual rigour but also a system which, by ceasing\u000a      to privilege fraud and error, strikes an appropriate balance between\u000a      existing owners and good faith acquirers from a non-owner.\u000a    The significance of these changes was conveyed by Fergus Ewing MSP,\u000a      Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism, proposing the motion in\u000a      Parliament that the Land Registration (Scotland) Bill 2012 should be\u000a      passed:\u000a    The bill seeks to provide the people of Scotland with a land register\u000a      that is fit for the 21st century....The bill will also provide for a\u000a      fairer and more balanced system of land registration ... By bringing\u000a      registration law more closely into line with general property law, the\u000a      bill addresses legal tensions that have caused confusion and uncertainty\u000a      for property owners since the introduction of the land register. The\u000a      changes will ensure that the land register continues to underpin the\u000a      Scottish economy. (5.4)\u000a    Commenting on the Land Registration Act, leading legal practitioner\u000a      Stewart Brymer said: `[A] special mention should be made of the dedicated\u000a      work and intellectual leadership of Professor Kenneth G C Reid and\u000a      Professor George Gretton. We are fortunate to have such eminent legal\u000a      scholars, and their contribution to the development of the Scottish law of\u000a      property, in what, I am sure, will be regarded in retrospect as a golden\u000a      age of the law of property in Scotland, cannot be over-estimated' (5.5).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research underpinning this case study &#8212; translated into policy and\u000a      legislation through service by Reid and Gretton at the Scottish Law\u000a      Commission &#8212; has contributed to the transformation of an outdated system\u000a      of land law in Scotland and its replacement with a coherent and principled\u000a      framework for land-ownership.

Extending to 655 pages, the book is mainly the work\u000a      of Reid (appointed in Edinburgh 1980), with an additional chapter by\u000a      Gretton (appointed in Edinburgh 1981). Reid and Gretton have written\u000a      extensively together on matters of property law, and are the authors of\u000a      the standard work on conveyancing (3.2) which, among other things, has\u000a      made their academic work more readily available to a professional audience\u000a      thereby facilitating uptake of the underpinning research.\u000a    Prior to the publication of The Law of Property in Scotland, this\u000a      field of law had been little studied: indeed it was hardly taught in\u000a      universities other than, indirectly, as an aside to conveyancing; and,\u000a      while there had been books on land law and, especially, conveyancing, no\u000a      work had attempted a scholarly study of property law in the round,\u000a      covering land and goods and intangibles. Based on an exhaustive study of\u000a      sources over a period of some 600 years, Reid's work proposed an\u000a      overarching theoretical structure which would work for property of all\u000a      types. By means of a new taxonomy and a series of high-level principles,\u000a      he showed how it was possible to organise and explain what had often\u000a      appeared as a jumble of unrelated rules. In short, Reid's work\u000a      rediscovered and reformulated the law of property in Scotland.\u000a    One result of that rediscovery was to expose major shortcomings in the\u000a      legislation which had introduced registration of title in Scotland.\u000a      Devised at a time when property law was largely unexamined and too little\u000a      known and understood, the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 undermined\u000a      a number of principles which, as a result of Reid's work, would come to be\u000a      seen as fundamental. Some of this had already been pointed out in The\u000a        Law of Property. In a later paper published in 1996 (3.3) Reid\u000a      emphasised the resulting conceptual impoverishment:\u000a    Registration of title gives every appearance of having been devised from\u000a      a severely practical point of view ... The result is that while\u000a      registration of title works (and works well) in practice, it does not work\u000a      in theory. This matters. A reform which is insufficiently conceptualised\u000a      is likely to run into trouble sooner or later. There will be\u000a      contradictions and paradoxes. There will be overlapping provisions. There\u000a      will be lacunae which the absence of a more general theory will make\u000a      extremely difficult to fill. And, in the particular case of registration\u000a      of title, there will be problems in accommodating the new system within\u000a      the background law of property.\u000a    Gretton was blunter still, describing the legislation in the following\u000a      year as `overambitious and under-researched' and having `all the\u000a      intellectual sharpness of a mashed potato' (3.4).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24411","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution (HLCC) is a\u000a      cross-party committee that examines all Bills before Parliament for their\u000a      constitutional compatibility, reporting to Parliament on the\u000a      constitutional impact of legislation.\u000a    In 2009, Tomkins was appointed as one of two legal advisers to the HLCC,\u000a      and has since drafted reports on over 30 Bills. On numerous occasions,\u000a      these reports have identified matters that have led to significant\u000a      legislative amendment by the House of Lords. Leading examples include the\u000a      Health and Social Care Bill (2011-12) and the Justice and Security Bill\u000a      (2012-13).\u000a    The Health and Social Care Bill (2011-12)\u000a    The Health and Social Care Bill sought to amend core aspects of the NHS\u000a      Act 2006, which governed the National Health Service in England. By virtue\u000a      of the 2006 Act, the Secretary of State is legally and politically\u000a      responsible to Parliament for the NHS in England. Tomkins highlighted\u000a      certain provisions in the Bill which would pose a risk to the Secretary of\u000a      State's continuing constitutional responsibility for the NHS. Two of these\u000a      provisions were; the definition of the Secretary of State's\u000a      responsibilities (Clause 1) and the introduction of Clinical Commissioning\u000a      Groups which would take over some service provision responsibilities\u000a      (Clause 1C). Tomkins advised HLCC that these provisions would risk\u000a      diluting the Government's constitutional responsibilities with regard to\u000a      the National Health Service. Following Tomkins' advice, the HLCC reported\u000a      (September 2011) that if the Health and Social Care Bill were enacted as\u000a      it stood, the chain of constitutional responsibility within the NHS would\u000a      be severed.\u000a    In November &#8212; December 2011, Tomkins and his fellow legal adviser\u000a      represented the HLCC at a series of meetings with Department of Health\u000a      officials and First Parliamentary Counsel, at which they discussed the\u000a      significant consequences of the Bill. Tomkins prepared a follow-up report,\u000a      which HLCC published in December 2011 [2; 3]. The report proposed\u000a      amendments to the Bill which were crucial to ensuring that the Secretary\u000a      of State's constitutional responsibilities for the NHS were positioned\u000a      beyond legal doubt. The House of Lords endorsed these amendments and the\u000a      amendments to Sections 1 and 1C of the Bill were adopted in the Act.\u000a    The follow-up report contains an Appendix (written by Tomkins) which sets\u000a      out in authoritative form the HLCC's understanding of the constitutional\u000a      conventions of ministerial responsibility to Parliament. This\u000a      understanding formed the basis of HLCC's subsequent work on the\u000a      Accountability of Civil Servants, an inquiry undertaken by HLCC in respect\u000a      of which Tomkins and Rawlings was a specialist adviser. Many of the\u000a      recommendations contained in the HLCC's final report from this inquiry\u000a      were supported by the Government in its response to the report.\u000a    The Justice and Security Bill (2012-13)\u000a    In Al Rawi v Security Service ([2011] UKSC 34) the UK Supreme\u000a      Court ruled that the courts had no inherent power to order that a civil\u000a      action may be heard under `closed material procedure' (CMP). CMP, invented\u000a      by statute in 1997, is used in some counter-terrorism contexts: it allows\u000a      sensitive material to be used as evidence in litigation without it being\u000a      served on the parties. Instead, it is served on a security-cleared\u000a      `special advocate'. The procedure is highly controversial.\u000a    In May 2012, the Government introduced its Justice and Security Bill into\u000a      Parliament. The Bill as introduced incorporated a number of\u000a      recommendations which Tomkins (together with Tom Hickman from University\u000a      College London) had made in an earlier response, on behalf of the Bingham\u000a      Centre for the Rule of Law, to a Green Paper published by the Government\u000a      in 2011. This response had argued that proposals such as advocating for\u000a      `closed material procedure' (CMP) to be available generally in civil\u000a      litigation were excessive. The Justice and Security Bill (as introduced)\u000a      proposed that CMP be available in civil trials only in the interests of\u000a      national security, a crucial recommendation made by Tomkins. However,\u000a      despite being an improvement on the 2011 Green Paper, the Bill remained\u000a      problematic.\u000a    When it was introduced into the House of Lords, Tomkins examined the Bill\u000a      and advised the HLCC. On the basis of his advice, HLCC published a report\u000a      (June 2012) which urged several amendments, including that; (a) any party\u000a      to a case (not only the Secretary of State) should be permitted to apply\u000a      for a trial to adopt a CMP; (b) the Bill needed to clarify the intended\u000a      relationship between CMP and the common law principles of Public Interest\u000a      Immunity; (c) Ministers should not be able to extend the availability of\u000a      CMP to other proceedings, such as inquests; (d) the Government should be\u000a      required to report annually to Parliament on the use of CMP; and (e) the\u000a      Bill should be independently reviewed five years after it comes into force\u000a      [7]. All of these recommendations were accepted by Parliament and now\u000a      appear in the Justice and Security Act 2013.\u000a    In both his work for the Bingham Centre and his advice on the Justice and\u000a      Security Bill for HLCC Tomkins drew extensively on research first\u000a      presented in his articles in the Law Quarterly Review and Current\u000a        Legal Problems on the Role of the Court, and Due Process in Law, as\u000a      they relate to questions of National Security (see (3) and (4) at Section\u000a      3, above).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Adam Tomkins of the University of Glasgow provides\u000a      research-based evidence and advice to the House of Lords Select Committee\u000a      on the Constitution, serving as one of their legal advisers since 2009\u000a      and, in that time, drafting reports on more than 30 Government Bills.

The research which underpins the\u000a      impact of his work centres on two main areas &#8212; the constitutional\u000a      conventions of ministerial responsibility and national security law &#8212; both\u000a      themes throughout Tomkins' academic career and key to several of his\u000a      publications.\u000a    (a) The conventions of ministerial responsibility\u000a    The convention of ministerial responsibility establishes the\u000a      accountability of government to Parliament. While at the University of\u000a      Glasgow, Tomkins has undertaken doctrinal scholarship on both the UK\u000a      constitution and EU public law in relation to such conventions. Among the\u000a      research questions explored by Tomkins' work in this area are the\u000a      following: how accountability and responsibility relate to one another;\u000a      how resignation and responsibility relate to one another; how ministerial\u000a      responsibility and the responsibility of others (e.g. civil servants)\u000a      relate to one another.\u000a    Tomkins' methodology in exploring these issues combines detailed\u000a      examination of case-studies, enabling him to distinguish constitutional\u000a      from unconstitutional conduct in a context that is often politically\u000a      fraught and lacking in clarity.\u000a    Key arguments advanced by Tomkins in the course of this work include the\u000a      following: that constitutional responsibility is a discrete concept, which\u000a      should be distinguished from what a minister is personally responsible\u000a      for; that the constitutional responsibility of ministers is owed\u000a      specifically to Parliament (although in other senses ministers may at the\u000a      same time owe obligations of responsibility to the Prime Minister, to\u000a      party, or even to the media); and that no constitutional distinction is to\u000a      be drawn between responsibility, accountability and answerability.\u000a    (b) National security law\u000a    Tomkins' scholarship which led to his recent outputs of 2010 [4] and 2011\u000a      [5] has given him extensive knowledge of due process in national security\u000a      litigation. National security requires the state to keep secrets; yet for\u000a      litigation to be fair it needs to be conducted as openly as possible. How\u000a      to trade off the competing public interests of national security secrets,\u000a      on the one hand, and open and natural justice, on the other, has proved to\u000a      be one of the most contested subjects in British public law in recent\u000a      years.\u000a    In his article National Security and the Role of the Court, Tomkins\u000a      sought to shift the focus from the treatment of national security and\u000a      counter-terrorism in the case law of the House of Lords towards an\u000a      examination of the approach taken in the lower administrative courts and\u000a      tribunals, whose task it is to consider such questions at first instance.\u000a    Through his analysis of decisions taken by these courts in the contexts\u000a      of control orders, proscribed organisations, and deprivation of\u000a      citizenship, Tomkins demonstrated that judicial scrutiny of government\u000a      actions and decisions taken in the interests of national security appears\u000a      never to have been more intense. Moreover, Tomkins' examination of the\u000a      work of the lower courts in this area has revealed that the approach they\u000a      adopt when considering whether something is in the interests of national\u000a      security differs considerably from that of the House of Lords. Whereas the\u000a      House of Lords argued that such questions are not questions of law but\u000a      instead of judgement and policy and should therefore be left to the\u000a      discretion of the Secretary of State, the lower courts have interpreted\u000a      the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights relating to the\u000a      right to a fair trial to mean that because questions of national security\u000a      have to come before the courts to ensure that such rights are not\u000a      violated, the claims made in the name of national security must be subject\u000a      to scrutiny by the courts.\u000a    Additionally, Tomkins has considered the issue of the use of closed\u000a      material in cases that deal with issues of national security and\u000a      counter-terrorism. Closed material is evidence that, for reasons of\u000a      national security, cannot be disclosed to individuals who are subject to\u000a      national security controls. Under such circumstances, a special advocate\u000a      with security clearance is appointed who is able to see the closed\u000a      evidence and make submissions to the court on behalf of the individual.\u000a      Once the special advocate has seen the close material, however, s\/he is\u000a      not generally permitted to communicate further with the individual.\u000a    Suggesting that the use of special advocates and closed material\u000a      represents one of the key struggles in accommodating security concerns\u000a      with due process in law, Tomkins has argued strongly for reform to current\u000a      rules governing such matters. He has proposed that a new rule should be\u000a      introduced such that: it can never be in accordance with the due process\u000a      of law for material evidence to remain closed in any form of legal\u000a      proceedings-even where a special advocate is appointed- unless both the\u000a      Government and the court have been required to balance the interest in\u000a      disclosure against the interest in non-disclosure.\u000a    Tomkins' scholarship in this area has contributed important commentary to\u000a      debates about the requirement for courts to be able scrutinise decisions\u000a      made by the executive to impose severe restrictions on people's rights and\u000a      civil liberties.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"25451","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact on policy debates\u000a    The research findings have influenced contributions to policy formulation\u000a      and access to justice\u000a      debates (e.g., following research presentations by Sarah Nason at the\u000a      Legal Services Research\u000a      Centre conference (Oxford 2012 \/Public Law Project London Conference\u000a      (2012)). The research\u000a      findings were presented at a time of consultation and debate about\u000a      possible changes to judicial\u000a      review and legal aid. The work provided empirical data, which assisted in\u000a      informing the debate and\u000a      responses to consultation exercises [5.1 &amp;, 5.2].\u000a    The research has also assisted the work of the Public Law Project (PLP)\u000a      (a non-Governmental\u000a      Organisation in the field of access to justice in public law). PLP's\u000a      Research Director confirmed that\u000a      the research has been of great interest to the PLP specifically for its\u000a      unique and original analysis of\u000a      the operation of the regional Centres and its addition to the evidence\u000a      base of empirical data\u000a      regarding judicial review generally which PLP has been collecting for many\u000a      years. The importance\u000a      of the data was proved when PLP were able to analyse and respond to recent\u000a      government\u000a      proposals to reform judicial review on the basis of empirical data rather\u000a      than general comment\u000a      [5.2].\u000a    The research has provided an on-going critical assessment of the\u000a      regionalisation project, in\u000a      particular adding to a base of knowledge about inconsistency of judicial\u000a      decision-making in the\u000a      Administrative Court especially at the permission stage [5.1 &amp; 5.10].\u000a    Impact within Her Majesty's Courts' and Tribunals' Service HMCTS\u000a    The research has impacted upon the case for maintaining and expanding the\u000a      regionalisation of\u000a      public law, particularly when other local courts (such as magistrates'\u000a      courts) were being closed due\u000a      to austerity measures [5.4].\u000a    In Wales the research has influenced the development of initiatives to\u000a      increase the number of\u000a      specialist practitioners and to broaden access to public law legal\u000a      services and remedies,\u000a      specifically by providing evidence of the lack of specialist legal\u000a      providers in Wales [5.6]. As a result\u000a      of the research the Administrative Court Lawyer for the Welsh &amp;\u000a      Western Circuits has begun to\u000a      arrange bi-annual, Administrative Court Office led training events [5.5].\u000a    In the Midlands the research has helped the Birmingham Administrative\u000a      Court put into place\u000a      measures to increase its share of the total caseload outside London and to\u000a      improve the efficiency\u000a      of the service it provides. The Administrative Court lawyer for the\u000a      Midlands has used the findings to\u000a      consider whether changes need to be made to increase the regional share of\u000a      the workload and\u000a      whether it is possible for the court to influence the region of issue.\u000a      E.g., it has been possible to see\u000a      the relatively low number of solicitors in the region issuing claims and\u000a      to target measures to attract\u000a      them. The research has also highlighted possibilities to provide an\u000a      improved quality of service\u000a      which in turn may result in an increase in usage of the regional\u000a      Administrative Court Centres [5.1 &amp;\u000a      5.5].\u000a    Impact on National assembly for Wales and Welsh Assembly Government\u000a    The research findings relating to public law in Wales formed part of\u000a      written and oral evidence to the\u000a      Welsh Assembly Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee. The\u000a      findings in relation to\u000a      access to justice, legal institutions, and the legal profession were cited\u000a      in the Committee's\u000a      December 2012 Report as informing the its understanding of what\u000a      institutions are needed to fully\u000a      establish a separate jurisdiction and on procedural changes necessary to\u000a      ensure currently\u000a      established Welsh institutions are sufficiently supported (para 33,\u000a      conclusions 1 &#8212; 4 (separate\u000a      jurisdiction for Wales) para 92 recommendation 2 (amendment to Civil\u000a      Procedure Rules) para 142\u000a      (legal education and qualification issues) [5.7]. The language used by\u000a      Sarah Nason in giving her\u000a      evidence to the Committee (that the Welsh jurisdiction question is one of\u000a      \"degrees and\u000a      development\") was adopted by the Committee's Chair in his response to the\u000a      Welsh Government's\u000a      launch of its own further consultation (in plenary 27 March 2012),\u000a      pertaining to the idea that a\u000a      Welsh jurisdiction would develop by degrees rather than as a singular\u000a      event (or even series of\u000a      events) and depends significantly on the establishment of separate legal\u000a      institutions (notably\u000a      separate courts) [5.7].\u000a    The research findings about the need to develop public law legal service\u000a      specialisation in Wales\u000a      were supported by recommendations made in a 2013 Welsh Government report The\u000a        Future of\u000a        Legal Services in Wales (July 2013).\u000a    Impact on the Judiciary:\u000a    The Lord Chief Justice for England and Wales has noted in his Birkenhead\u000a        Lecture to the\u000a      members of Grays Inn (21 October 2013) (paras 40 and 41 especially) that\u000a      the research discloses\u000a      the differential development of the public law bar outside London and that\u000a      this disparity requires\u000a      urgent rectification [5.6]. Both the present Lord Chief Justice and\u000a      President of the Queen's Bench\u000a      Division have drawn on the research findings in keeping up to date with\u000a      the variable Administrative\u000a      Court caseload (views expressed in a meeting with Sarah Nason at the RCJ\u000a      October 2013) [5.6].\u000a      Other members of the judiciary have noted that following the research they\u000a      are better informed in\u000a      dealing with cases in the regions [5.1].\u000a    Impact on legal services providers:\u000a    The research has contributed to awareness of public law outside London\u000a      and the need for London-based\u000a      advisers to take advantage of the regional Courts. It has contributed to\u000a      the growing\u000a      realisation of the need for those based in London to serve other nations\u000a      and regions better. That\u000a      has reflected itself in a greater awareness of the need to travel outside\u000a      London for the purpose of\u000a      giving advice to clients or for court hearings [5.1]. As part of the\u000a      research two CPD workshops\u000a      were held (Llandudno and Cardiff) in November 2010. The participants\u000a      included local authority\u000a      representatives, practitioners, and court staff. The findings were\u000a      considered by the Administrative\u000a      Court User Group in Wales and presented in the minutes of one of its\u000a      meetings (June 2012),\u000a      solicitors present agreed to action the recommendation to develop measures\u000a      ensuring they instruct\u000a      local counsel wherever possible [5.8].\u000a    Impact on legal aid provision\/access to justice for unrepresented\u000a        litigants\u000a    Early findings from the research formed part of Bangor Law School's\u000a      submission to the House of\u000a      Commons Welsh Affairs Committee (April 2009) considering closure of the\u000a      Legal Services\u000a      Commission Office in Cardiff. The findings were cited in the Committee's\u000a      Report (para 28) and\u000a      influenced the Committee's recommendation for an urgent reconsideration of\u000a      the plans to close the\u000a      Cardiff office [5.9]. The research finding that current legal aid policies\u000a      in relation to public law may\u000a      be disproportionately damaging to regional service providers have been\u000a      made known to the new\u000a      Legal Aid Board and will be taken into account when new legal aid\u000a      contracts are awarded [5.3].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Bangor Law School's research into the work of the Administrative Court\u000a      and the regional market for\u000a      legal services in public law has challenged the orthodox view that public\u000a      law is the preserve of\u000a      London.

In\u000a      2009 Administrative Court Centres were established in 3 English regions\u000a      and in Wales. The\u000a      research examined regional access to public law litigation, before and\u000a      after establishment of these\u000a      Centres, and provided data to Her Majesty's Courts' and Tribunals' Service\u000a      (HMCTS), the judiciary,\u000a      practitioners, and policy-makers, about the market for public law legal\u000a      services and barriers to\u000a      access to justice. The research consisted of data collection, collation,\u000a      and analysis (including\u000a      Administrative Court data) (conducted in 2009, 2011, and 2013); and\u000a      interviews (2009 - 2013),\u000a      electronic surveys (2009 and 2011), and workshops (Cardiff and Llandudno\u000a      November 2010 &#8212;approx.\u000a      20 attendees during each workshop, predominantly barristers, solicitors,\u000a      and local\u000a      government representatives, London March 2013 &#8212; 16 attendees,\u000a      Administrative Court Staff,\u000a      judges, barristers, solicitors, local government representatives, Legal\u000a      Aid Board representative).\u000a    A key hypothesis of the research was that legal service providers would\u000a      `cluster' around the new\u000a      Court Centres, thus increasing caseloads and improving access to justice\u000a      for litigants (including\u000a      meeting existing latent demand for public law advice identified by the\u000a      research) [a4 &amp; a6]. The\u000a      research found that geographical access to public law legal services was\u000a      patchy before\u000a      regionalisation [a4], and remains so after, predominantly because legal\u000a      aid policy has been\u000a      disadvantageous to non-specialist providers especially in the regions\u000a      where caseloads are\u000a      comparatively low [a1, a2, a3, a5 &amp; a6]. There was an evident lack of\u000a      specialist legal providers in\u000a      the regions and limited inter-action between solicitors and the local bar\u000a      [a4 &amp; a6]. The research\u000a      recommended further training for local providers and more engagement with\u000a      HMCTS [a4, a6 &amp; a3].\u000a      It also found that local barristers would be capable of handling many\u000a      so-called case-level or street-level\u000a      judicial review claims, despite local solicitors continuing to instruct\u000a      London-based counsel [a1,\u000a      a5, &amp; a6]. The research disclosed a link between unrepresented\u000a      litigation and poor outcomes for\u000a      claimants (notably failure at the permission stage) and built on previous\u000a      research highlighting\u000a      inconsistency in permission grant rates (especially across the plurality\u000a      of locations in which claims\u000a      can now be issued) [a1, a5 &amp; a6].\u000a    The research highlighted the successes of the regional Courts in reducing\u000a      waiting times and\u000a      providing an efficient, good quality, service to users [a1, a2, a3 &amp;\u000a      a5]. However, the research also\u000a      identified the difficulties of operating a specialist jurisdiction on a\u000a      small scale (such as judicial\u000a      deployment, court resources, sufficient caseloads, local awareness) [a1,\u000a      a3, a4, a5 &amp; a6]. It also\u000a      highlighted some problems of overlapping jurisdictions (i.e.\u000a      `forum-shopping' e.g. issuing in London\u000a      to take advantage of longer waiting times, and inconsistent development of\u000a      case law) and fed\u000a      these concerns into the Welsh Assembly's consultation on a separate\u000a      jurisdiction for Wales [a1,\u000a      a4, a5 &amp; a6].\u000a    The research exposed the diversity of topics covered by judicial review\u000a      litigation, the plurality of\u000a      roles performed by the procedure, and how this relates to the market for\u000a      legal services and the\u000a      development of legal principles [a1]. These concerns and the analysis of\u000a      caseloads informed\u000a      debate about the future of judicial review, dispelling myths about its\u000a      impact, and highlighting the\u000a      need for more nuanced analysis of its constitutional value and impact\u000a      [a1].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"26551","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Two documented examples of the impact arising from the aforementioned\u000a      research into evidence\u000a      in asylum claims are outlined below. The impact can be defined as an\u000a      effect on legal practice,\u000a      evidenced by research findings stimulating debate amongst practitioners,\u000a      leading to developments\u000a      in attitudes and behaviours, alongside documented evidence of influence on\u000a      guidelines. In both\u000a      examples, a set of judicial guidelines were drawn up to aid best practice\u000a      in asylum determination.\u000a    The first example of impact concerns the investigation into reception of\u000a      medical evidence which led\u000a      to the development of guidelines to be adopted by the IARLJ. The IARLJ is\u000a      the main international\u000a      organisation in the field of asylum and refugee law with a membership of\u000a      over 300 judges in 46\u000a      countries. Asylum applications may include presentation of, for instance\u000a      evidence of torture as the\u000a      basis of an asylum claim, or evidence of psychological disturbance as a\u000a      reason for inconsistent or\u000a      incomplete testimony. The quality of evidence presented can vary\u000a      internationally, and some types\u000a      of evidence, for instance the claim that injuries were caused by torture,\u000a      is inherently difficult to\u000a      establish, especially after the passage of time. As mentioned previously,\u000a      the need for guidelines on\u000a      medical evidence was recognised by the IARLJ in the Expert Evidence\u000a      Working Parties and their\u000a      development was discussed at IARLJ World Conferences.\u000a    Subsequently, Wallace and Wylie were chosen (E1)\u000a      to lead the research and to draw up\u000a      recommendations to be included in a guidance document for the IARLJ. The\u000a      guidelines (E2) set\u000a      out principles that are generally applicable across the wide variety of\u000a      refugee determination\u000a      systems and procedures found internationally. The guidelines were adopted\u000a      by the IARLJ and\u000a      recommended for use, and initially published on its website in May 2010\u000a      (with a final version\u000a      uploaded in June 2011). They are intended as a `living document', to be\u000a      refined through their use\u000a      in practice, and reviewed after a period of three years from publication.\u000a      It is expected that Wallace\u000a      and Wylie will undertake this review. Initial reactions within the\u000a      impact period have been positive,\u000a      and Judges have commented that the guidelines are useful both in practice\u000a      and in training\u000a      environments (E3).\u000a    Further to this, there has been interest in the guidelines from: Freedom\u000a      from Torture (E4), a UK\u000a      medical foundation for the care of victims of torture, in a 2011 report\u000a      where they are said to\u000a      \"represent the most current and complete guidance on these matters and a\u000a      consensus of\u000a      international judicial opinion, and could be used to good effect in\u000a      developing consistency in\u000a      decision-making in this area\" (p. 60); and in wider guidance drawn up by\u000a      the IARLJ as part of the\u000a      Credo project (E5), a partly EU-funded joint project of the\u000a      Hungarian Helsinki Committee, the\u000a      United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, IARLJ and Asylum Aid &#8212; the\u000a      IARLJ has drawn\u000a      up wider guidance on credibility assessment in asylum cases. For\u000a      assistance in the use of expert\u000a      medical evidence, users of the paper are directed to the guidelines (E5\u000a      p. 39).\u000a    Following publication of the guidelines, Wallace and Wylie\u000a      co-presented a paper at a symposium\u000a      in Edinburgh in 2011. This was based on the research for the IARLJ, and\u000a      aimed to disseminate the\u000a      research findings while raising the profile of the guidelines. Several\u000a      practitioners were in\u000a      attendance including: an advocate; an immigration judge; and\u000a      representatives from the UK Borders\u000a      Agency and the Scottish Refugee Council (E6).\u000a    The second example of impact is underpinned by the British Academy funded\u000a      work on COI. A\u000a      Working Party Session was led by Wylie (E7) at the 9th\u000a      World Conference of the IARLJ in 2011\u000a      where Wallace and Wylie's co-authored paper (E8)\u000a      formed the basis for a discussion on the\u000a      difficulties in ascertaining the objectivity and relevance of expert\u000a      country evidence compared to\u000a      expert medical evidence. The objective of such Working Party sessions is\u000a      to assist in the\u000a      development of a coherent body of international refugee jurisprudence: the\u000a      working party is said to\u000a      \"make a direct contribution to the principal constitutional objects of the\u000a      Association which, in turn,\u000a      strengthens the international refugee protection regime or system in the\u000a      world today while\u000a      protecting and advancing the rights of refugees.\" (E9).\u000a    Subsequently Wallace was asked, in May 2013, to sit on the\u000a      Advisory Board of a project to draft a\u000a      best practice guide for country expert evidence. This involvement can be\u000a      expected to have future\u000a      impact on the UK asylum determination process, but within this REF\u000a      assessment period, has\u000a      resulted in the publication of a best practice guide on writing COI\u000a      reports (E10). The guide was\u000a      published in July 2013 on the Electronic Immigration Network, and it\u000a      provides a practical hands-on\u000a      tool to aid the writing of effective and useful country evidence reports.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A series of projects which examined judicial reception of evidence and\u000a      enabled development and\u000a      uptake of guides for best practice in asylum determination has contributed\u000a      to international good\u000a      practice in a field where it is difficult to ensure objective and fair\u000a      decision making. The projects\u000a      included analysis of: gender guidelines; medical evidence; Country of\u000a      Origin Information (COI); and\u000a      best practice where children are subject to the asylum process, including\u000a      COI and evidence\u000a      relating to age assessment. The research has stimulated and contributed to\u000a      debate among\u000a      practitioners. Further, medical evidence guidelines proposed by the\u000a      research team have been\u000a      adopted by the International Association of Refugee Law Judges (IARLJ)\u000a      affecting judicial activity\u000a      internationally. In addition, research into reception of evidence\u000a      surrounding COI led to a position on\u000a      an Advisory Board and development of a further best practice guide.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Robert Gordon University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Robert Gordon University","InstitutionName":"Robert Gordon University","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10005500}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000aR1 Wallace, R.

Wallace (Professor of\u000a      International Human Rights\u000a      Law 2003 - 2009, Visiting Professor 2009 - 2012, returned to RGU full time\u000a      as Research\u000a      Professor of International Human Rights and Justice, 2012 &#8212; present); Anne\u000a      Holliday (Research\u000a      Assistant 2001 - 2010; Karen Wylie ( Research Assistant 2007 &#8212;\u000a      present).\u000a    For the last 10 years, the abovementioned team has analysed existing\u000a      guidance around asylum\u000a      determination and judicial reception of evidence. The first project in the\u000a      series ran from 2003 - 2005\u000a      when Wallace and Holliday were awarded a Nuffield\u000a      Foundation Research Grant to conduct\u000a      an analysis of the Immigration Appellant Authority's Gender Guidelines and\u000a      their application within\u000a      the UK asylum determination process. Wallace came to the project\u000a      having previously conducted\u000a      research on gender issues in asylum determination and bringing subject\u000a      expertise in the discipline\u000a      of international human rights law and refugee law. The team brought its\u000a      findings to practitioner\u000a      conferences in 2004 and 2005, followed by the publication of a chapter in\u000a      a text on international\u000a      law in 2006 (R3). In addition, an update of the EU and ECHR\u000a      sections on refugee law by Wallace\u000a      for immigration judges in 2004 made reference to the gender guidelines. A\u000a      more recent output\u000a      related to gender issues in refugee status determination took the form of\u000a      a sole-authored chapter in\u000a      Contemporary Issues in Refugee Law (R6).\u000a    Subsequently, in 2008, another Nuffield Foundation grant allowed Wallace\u000a      and Wylie to undertake\u000a      a project initiated by the IARLJ concerning the judicial reception of\u000a      medical evidence in asylum\u000a      claims. Wallace initiated the project having heard the call for\u000a      guidelines being expressed in various\u000a      fora by immigration judges and case workers. The format and the\u000a      requirement to produce a `user\u000a      friendly' tool were similar to the requirements for the gender guidelines\u000a      and both the medical\u000a      evidence guidance and gender guidelines both relied partly on a\u000a      comparative assessment of\u000a      guidance and practice within different jurisdictions. The medical evidence\u000a      project examined\u000a      international case law to establish how expert medical evidence was being\u000a      assessed in practice by\u000a      decision makers and legal representatives and an online questionnaire was\u000a      sent out to decision-making\u000a      bodies in international chapters of the IARLJ. From the data, Wallace\u000a      and Wylie\u000a      extrapolated generally applicable principles of how expert evidence should\u000a      be approached by\u000a      asylum and refugee status decision-makers worldwide, and drew up\u000a      guidelines for adoption by the\u000a      IARLJ in 2010. Further details on the development of the Guidelines\u000a      will appear in a peer reviewed\u000a      paper in the International Journal of Refugee Law.\u000a    Then, in 2008-2009, with British Academy funding, Wallace and Wylie\u000a      conducted research on a\u000a      related area where disputed asylum claims depend on expert evidence,\u000a      namely COI. It had\u000a      become apparent during the research on expert medical evidence that\u000a      evidence cannot be taken in\u000a      isolation, but that objective, current and accurate information of one\u000a      type impacts on other, related\u000a      evidence. Accordingly, medical evidence must be seen in the context of COI\u000a      from the country in\u000a      which the alleged torture or ill-treatment has occurred. Subsequently, Wallace\u000a      and Wylie were\u000a      amongst the authors of a discussion paper given at the 9th World\u000a      Conference of the IARLJ in 2011\u000a      where Wylie led the Working Party Session on `COI as expert\u000a      evidence'.\u000a    More recently, in 2010, research into COI in the context of claims\u000a      relating to children was\u000a      conducted, again with a Nuffield grant. Wallace had previously\u000a      published on issues around\u000a      children in the asylum process, including R1 and R2, and\u000a      has since published a co-authored case\u000a      note examining the best interests of the child (R4) and a further\u000a      co-authored paper in the British\u000a      Medical Bulletin on considerations in the assessment of age (R5).\u000a      This is a natural follow-on from\u000a      previous work in that it addresses the complexity of evidence in this\u000a      field and recognises the\u000a      particular needs of a vulnerable group in the asylum system. It again\u000a      highlights the need for\u000a      evidence that is transparent, contemporary and accurate to facilitate the\u000a      establishment of a\u000a      claimant's credibility.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"26552","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In line with the University's focus on applied, translational research,\u000d\u000a      the main impacts here are within two particular non-academic communities;\u000d\u000a      practitioners (particularly judges and tribunal chairs) and legislators.\u000d\u000a      Here the impact has been in respect of both legal substance and process,\u000d\u000a      and has contributed to debates around effecting change to the existing\u000d\u000a      law, and to how law is interpreted and applied.\u000d\u000a    The first example of impact describes contribution to the debate during\u000d\u000a      the parliamentary process for the Offensive Behaviour at Football and\u000d\u000a      Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill and contribution to the\u000d\u000a      discussion about whether to reject emergency legislative procedure. The\u000d\u000a      response (CE1) to Justice 2 Committee consultation in 2011 led to\u000d\u000a      discussion in Committee debates of the position put forward by Christie\u000d\u000a      and McArdle.\u000d\u000a    The written submission is referred to and used by various other\u000d\u000a      respondents and by MSPs (CE2) during debates. In addition, the\u000d\u000a      consultation response was an agenda item (CE3) where it was\u000d\u000a      discussed extensively (CE4). The submission added weight to the\u000d\u000a      argument behind rejection of emergency legislative procedure, and use of\u000d\u000a      more normal parliamentary process where lengthy debate of the Bill could\u000d\u000a      take place.\u000d\u000a    The stance taken in the written submission was also discussed in press\u000d\u000a      articles (Douglas Walker, \"New hate crime law's an attack on justice\", The\u000d\u000a      Sun, 2 Sept 2011; Eddie Barnes \"Reality bites\", Scotland on Sunday, Jun\u000d\u000a      26, 2011) meaning the issue, and the researcher's position on the issue,\u000d\u000a      has reached a wider audience than originally anticipated. The work has had\u000d\u000a      further reach into the area of human rights in Scotland, where the\u000d\u000a      submission paper was cited in the Scottish Human Rights Commission's\u000d\u000a      research report (CE5).\u000d\u000a    Christie was also invited to speak to the Fans Against\u000d\u000a      Criminalisation campaign which is made up of the main Celtic supporters'\u000d\u000a      organisations, at a public meeting they organised in opposition to the\u000d\u000a      Bill. An invitation-only symposium, drawing its audience from\u000d\u000a      practitioners and government bodies, was also organised, at which Christie\u000d\u000a      was invited to present her research findings. (In both cases, Christie\u000d\u000a      was unable to attend for the reasons underlying the special circumstances\u000d\u000a      noted for her) (CE6).\u000d\u000a    The second example of impact is largely concerned with impact on process\u000d\u000a      and procedure. These fields (process and procedure) are sometimes rather\u000d\u000a      overlooked in favour of substantive aspects of law but are the areas of\u000d\u000a      law that have significant relevance to, and impact on, legal practice,\u000d\u000a      both at the level of practitioners and courts. Evidence of this can be\u000d\u000a      found in the positive citations and reviews of Auchie's work by\u000d\u000a      practitioners in a number of fields, the MHTS book especially was\u000d\u000a      positively reviewed (CE7) in the light of its contribution to\u000d\u000a      practice, as well as academia.\u000d\u000a    The book has also been utilised in appeal hearings. There is evidence of\u000d\u000a      use made by Sheriff Principal Bowen of specific points relating to the\u000d\u000a      role of curators in appeal hearing in the case of Gordon Henderson v\u000d\u000a        Mental Health Tribunal and Grant Pagan (CE8), an appeal to\u000d\u000a      the Sheriff Principal from a decision of the Mental Health tribunal. It\u000d\u000a      was referred to by both sides in their arguments on a particular point of\u000d\u000a      statutory interpretation, and by the judge. In addition, the text was\u000d\u000a      cited in the judgement by Sheriff Principal Young in the case of Black\u000d\u000a        v MHTS in 2010 (CE9). The impact here is in its verifiable\u000d\u000a      effect on the practice of law in the courts.\u000d\u000a    The book has also been cited in consultation responses from Howard League\u000d\u000a      Scotland. (The Howard League for Penal Reform in Scotland is an\u000d\u000a      independent organisation whose members seek improvements to the criminal\u000d\u000a      justice system in Scotland.)\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Two particular examples of impact on legislative change and legal\u000d\u000a      practice are described: impact on the parliamentary process and impact on\u000d\u000a      mental health practice and procedure. The first example describes\u000d\u000a      contribution to debate during the parliamentary process for the Offensive\u000d\u000a      Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill and\u000d\u000a      contribution to the decision to reject rushed emergency legislation.

The first paper in this vein (UR1)\u000d\u000a      described recent trends in breach of the peace, with particular focus on\u000d\u000a      how the definition and scope of the crime within Scots law had waxed and\u000d\u000a      waned over the decades, and proved itself to be capable of being extremely\u000d\u000a      elastic and capable of being stretched to cover a wide range of types of\u000d\u000a      low to moderate level criminal behaviour. Christie then went onto\u000d\u000a      tackle further issues around the definition of breach of the peace and its\u000d\u000a      inherent flexibility, in the light of the requirements for procedural\u000d\u000a      fairness under Art 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (UR2).\u000a      This overall theme of the adequacy of common law and the need to\u000d\u000a      legislate, was further analysed (UR3) in the context of the debate\u000d\u000a      on assisted suicide following the media frenzy prompted by the Diane\u000d\u000a      Pretty case.\u000d\u000a    Christie's more recent paper on breach of the peace and offensive\u000d\u000a      behaviour (UR4) again seeks to explore the merits of using existing\u000d\u000a      common law in the guise of breach of the peace over further, rushed,\u000d\u000a      legislation. The paper was based on the position put forward in a written\u000d\u000a      response (CE1) with Dr David McArdle (Senior Lecturer, Stirling Law\u000d\u000a      School) to the Justice 2 Committee consultation on a proposed Bill, Christie's\u000a      contribution being on criminal law. The paper (UR4) involved an\u000d\u000a      examination of existing criminal law provisions to deal with offensive\u000d\u000a      behaviour in light of major debate following Old Firm (Celtic and Rangers\u000d\u000a      derby) games in the previous season and the Neil Lennon case. It concluded\u000d\u000a      that sufficient common law provisions were already available, contrary to\u000d\u000a      Government stated position, and it was critical of the Government's\u000d\u000a      approach to emergency legislation.\u000d\u000a    The second example of impact, which is largely seen as an impact on legal\u000d\u000a      practice and procedure, is underpinned by Auchie's text on the new\u000d\u000a      Scottish Mental Health Tribunal (UR5). In his role as part time\u000d\u000a      tribunal chair on the Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland, Auchie\u000d\u000a      recognised the need for a book on tribunal procedure to help those dealing\u000d\u000a      with a system that had been significantly overhauled. The text (UR5),\u000a      looks to explore, explain and put into context an important new\u000d\u000a      development in the law (the reformed Mental Health (Care and Treatment)\u000d\u000a      (Scotland) Act 2003).

This interest was particularly linked to\u000d      the impact of Professor Freeman's research, which has made a very\u000d      significant contribution to the knowledge and practice in this area,\u000d      including in relation to the lives of those affected by various related\u000d      issues, including: International Child Abduction, Relocation, Forced\u000d      Marriages, Mediation, Children's Rights, and Gender.\u000d    During the course of CFLP's existence and Freeman's research outputs,\u000d      public awareness has undoubtedly been raised in relation both to those\u000d      practising (legally and otherwise professionally), as well as those who\u000d      are affected by them, that is, victims and their families. Freeman has\u000d      made important contributions to scholarship in this field, producing key\u000d      peer-reviewed journal articles, delivering keynote conference papers, and\u000d      contributing by invitation to international policy debates. Further, her\u000d      work has influenced the development and shape of the law by the effect it\u000d      has had on legal practitioners and judges. It has been cited repeatedly by\u000d      members of the judiciary in their judgments, still a relatively rare\u000d      occurrence, which provides a cogent indication of its practical value,\u000d      reach and significance both domestically and internationally. The success\u000d      of the CFLP and its work has resulted in the appointment of Jacqueline\u000d      Mburu as Research Assistant on the University Responses to Forced Marriage\u000d      and Violence Against Women project from July 2012, and Sonalini\u000d      Gunasekera, as an Intern\/Research Assistant on the Long-Term Effects of\u000d      Abduction project between November and December 2012.\u000d    Freeman is an internationally-renowned authority in international child\u000d      law, was a long-term member of the Legal Working Group advising the\u000d      All-Party Parliamentary Committee on International Child Abduction until\u000d      its recent dissolution, and has been approached to become involved with\u000d      the successor to that group. She publishes widely and is regularly invited\u000d      to address both national and international conferences on her work, often\u000d      as keynote speaker, and to participate in multi-disciplinary working\u000d      groups operating in her areas of expertise. She was invited to address the\u000d      prestigious International Judicial Conference on Cross Border Family\u000d      Relocation, Washington DC, March 2010, where she co-presented a paper\u000d      detailing the global research in this area for the international experts\u000d      in attendance which has become a welcome resource concerning the available\u000d      conflicted research in this area. The written and broadcast media have\u000d      been keen to disseminate information about Freeman's research and\u000d      associated activities.\u000d    Baroness Hale of Richmond, a former academic and a member of the Supreme\u000d      Court with a keen interest in the development of Family Law, is the very\u000d      active Patron of the CFLP and is often involved in its activities. Lord\u000d      Justice Thorpe, Head of International Family Justice, England and Wales,\u000d      is an important supporter of the CFLP and Professor Freeman's work. Many\u000d      academics and researchers are keen to contribute to the work of CFLP, and\u000d      many attended the inaugural CFLP Summer School on \"Children and the Law\"\u000d      in 2010.\u000d    The CFLP's on-line, peer-reviewed journal continues the aim of bringing\u000d      together the academic and practical perspectives of Family Law. It has an\u000d      editorial board which includes key academics, lawyers, and judges. The\u000d      regard in which the CFLP and Professor Freeman are held by the\u000d      international community is evidenced in the success of the\u000d      multi-disciplinary international inaugural conference which the CFLP held\u000d      in 2010 on the linked themes of International Child Abduction, Forced\u000d      Marriage and Relocation, and the overwhelming response to the follow-up\u000d      conference in July 2013 on Parentage, Equality and Gender, which attracted\u000d      over 200 delegates. The Call for Papers for the 2013 conference received\u000d      approximately 150 responses, with accepted presentations from 25 different\u000d      countries, and renowned academics and researchers so eager to participate\u000d      that a waiting list had to be created for speaking places.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    The case study is concerned with the issue of international family law\u000d      disputes, especially how the law affects those involved in such cases.\u000d      Over the last few years, the research has had extensive impact among\u000d      lawyers, mediators, judges and families. The stimulus for the research was\u000d      realisation that there was a pressing need for closer professional\u000d      collaborations in order to deliver improved outcomes for affected\u000d      families. To this end, the Centre for Family Law and Practice (CFLP) was\u000d      established at London Metropolitan University (LMU) in January 2009. Under\u000d      the auspices of CFLP, interdisciplinary experts worked on these issues.\u000d      CFLP assists courts, including the United Kingdom and United States\u000d      Supreme Courts, with amicus curiae briefs based in particular on\u000d      the research of Professor Marilyn Freeman, abetted by that of Dr Frances\u000d      Burton.\u000d    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000d    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"London Metropolitan University","InstitutionName":"London Metropolitan University","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"London","UKPRN":10004048}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d    \u000a`The Effects and Consequences of International Child Abduction', Family\u000a        Law Quarterly, (1998) 32, 603.

So,\u000d      valuable though empirical research can be, citing it in judgment is\u000d      something that we judges find that we have to approach with considerable\u000d      care\". Baroness Hales expressed herself to be \"so pleased\" with Professor\u000d      Freeman's `Effects of Abduction' research because it distinguishes between\u000d      primary carer and other abductions which is a \"hugely relevant variable in\u000d      looking at the effects on the child of the abduction\" and said that\u000d      \"someone has to assess the benefits of the research from that point of\u000d      view as well\". She continued: \"One of the most interesting conclusions to\u000d      emerge from Freeman's research on the effects of child abduction is that\u000d      \"children abducted by their primary carers usually do not perceive the\u000d      experience as one of abduction but, when abducted by their non-primary\u000d      carers, they do,\" and it's that sort of comment that leads me to be more\u000d      sceptical of the American research that was being quoted. It doesn't draw\u000d      those sorts of careful distinctions. And it's the return that seems to\u000d      produce the more profound effects, this is again Marilyn Freeman's\u000d      research, but it is the effects of the parental conflict which seem to be\u000d      the greatest problem of the children. Now, this study was of course\u000d      looking at the effects on the children who were returned, but we need more\u000d      research there because we need to look at the effects on the children who\u000d      are not returned, who are in the same position as relocated children, but\u000d      the relocation having taken place in a different context, in a different\u000d      way, and that we need to compare the two to see whether doing it in one\u000d      way is more or less damaging than doing it in another\".

David Hodson,\u000d      consultant at the International Family Law Group, called the conference\u000d      `perhaps the most important international family law conference ever to\u000d      take place in England' (http:\/\/www.familylaw.co.uk\/articles\/david-hodson-on-international-family-law-3).\u000d    Freeman has an international\u000a        reputation for her research into international child law, developed\u000d      since the late 1990s. She published her first peer-reviewed article on the\u000d      effects of international child abduction in 1998, in the US-based, Family\u000a        Law Quarterly. Until this time, while child abduction was the\u000d      subject of international concern and an international legal regime had\u000d      been created for its control, very little research had been undertaken on\u000d      how it impacted on the families concerned, specifically the children, and\u000d      thus whether the legal mechanisms for its control were appropriate and as\u000d      helpful as they could be.\u000d    Freeman's research on child abduction provides new insights into the\u000d      realities of abduction for the families involved. Her research informs\u000d      international and domestic policy debates in this area, is used by legal\u000d      practitioners during court proceedings in many different jurisdictions,\u000d      and is often cited by members of the judiciary in their judgements.\u000d      Knowledge gained from Freeman's research has been applied in the practical\u000d      development of international law in this area. Freeman provided the\u000d      academic input of an Amicus Brief in the US Supreme Court case in the\u000d      seminal case of Abbott v Abbott in 2009, and the CFLP submitted an\u000d      Amicus Brief which cites and uses Freeman's research to the US Supreme\u000d      Court in the case of Chafin heard in December 2012. Leading and\u000d      junior counsel from two of the most prominent English specialist\u000d      barristers' chambers represented the CFLP pro bono in this\u000d      important case which addresses Freeman's research concerning the welfare\u000d      of children who have been abducted. Freeman was also asked to work with\u000d      another specialist team of lawyers on a recent UK Supreme Court case\u000d      concerning relocation, in which Freeman's research was critical. Her most\u000d      recent research develops her earlier work by examining specifically the\u000d      long-term effects of abduction on adults and young people who were\u000d      abducted as children, an area which has not been researched on this scale\u000d      before, and which Freeman is able to do because of her long-established\u000d      involvement in this area, and the significant expertise which she is\u000d      recognised as having by the professionals, and the families, involved in\u000d      these cases.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27756","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our research has had the following distinct Impacts:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aAdoption of Law-Proof Risk-Related Approach to Tender Design:\u000a        Following our findings on\u000a        contract standardisation and the recommendation that tender evaluation\u000a        criteria be transparently\u000a        defined, the Welsh Government established a Procurement\u000a          Implementation Board in 2010 to\u000a        create the Supplier Qualification Information Database (`SQUiD') tool.\u000a        As a result of our findings,\u000a        public purchasers using SQUiD move from a pro-forma approach to\u000a        tender design, to a new law-proofed\u000a        SME-friendly, risk-related approach.

This recommendation was\u000a        adopted by the Welsh\u000a        Government in 2009. As a result, the annual number of public sector\u000a        contracts valued at less than\u000a        &#163;130,000 advertised on the National Sell2Wales website increased\u000a        by 81% between 2009 and\u000a        2012[b2, b10]. Over the same period, public sector requests for\u000a        quotes publicly advertised\u000a        increased by 150% [b2]. NHS Wales followed suit in 2010, and\u000a        adopted our recommended\u000a        contract advertising threshold of &#163;25,000 [b2], resulting in a\u000a        major increase in transparency of\u000a        commercial opportunities for SMEs seeking to win NHS business.

Significantly,\u000a        using the \"Bangor simplified open\u000a        procedure\", both Councils have reduced the length of their tenders by\u000a        over 80%. The reduction in\u000a        procurement officer input to a mere 20 hours from start to finish has\u000a        saved each Council significant\u000a        time and money in tender design, development and assessment. This\u000a        represents a substantial\u000a        efficiency gain.

The TRI methodology has been\u000a        extensively used within 11 Local\u000a        Authority regions in Ireland since 2011. In 2013, the Enterprise Europe\u000a        Network (Flanders) cited\u000a        the TRI as the perfect methodology for improving tendering success\u000a        rates.\u000a      \u000aSME Tendering Competency Development based on our research: The\u000a        Welsh\u000a        Government's Business Wales-Tendering refers to the Tender\u000a        Review Instrument in the\u000a        \"How2Tender\" workshops they deliver to Welsh SMEs.

Following TRI use, within 1 year, its tender\u000a        success rate doubled from 20%\u000a        to 41%, accompanied by a financial turnover increase of 36%. Even more\u000a        significantly, they were\u000a        successful in joining 4 lucrative framework agreements that have secured\u000a        their future (having not\u000a        succeeded in joining any before), allowing them to safeguard their\u000a        employees' jobs and indeed to\u000a        award pay rises.

The Law\u000a      School procurement research group formed the Bangor Institute for\u000a      Competition &amp; Procurement\u000a      Studies, conducting evidence-based research projects, funded by\u000a      substantial grants from the\u000a      European Union Ireland\/Wales programme and the Welsh Government. In Phase\u000a      I of the research\u000a      (the Barriers Research Project, 2008\/9) our programme focused on the\u000a      procurement transparency\u000a      theme, isolating, identifying and categorising 6 main procurement barrier\u000a      groups inhibiting SME\u000a      engagement in public procurement. The Bangor Research Team was led by\u000a      Professor Dermot\u000a      Cahill (from 2007), assisted by Ceri Evans (Research Assistant 2009,\u000a      Research Lecturer from\u000a      2010) and Gary Clifford (Research Lecturer from 2010) . Empirical data was\u000a      gathered from 118\u000a      Welsh SMEs, and EU law jurisprudential research conducted in parallel, to\u000a      assess barrier\u000a      compatibility with EU procurement law. Phase II, the Winning in\u000a        Tendering Project (August 2010 to\u000a      November 2012), was designated as a \"Strategic Project\" by the EU INTERREG\u000a      programme on\u000a      account of the transferability of its findings to other EU Member States.\u000a      This research was\u000a      undertaken by Cahill, Evans, Clifford, Eyo (Lecturer from 2011) and Telles\u000a      (Lecturer from 2011).\u000a      We investigated low value procurement legal feasibility, focussing on EU\u000a      Remedies Directive\u000a      implications for SMEs seeking judicial review, electronic procurement and\u000a      cross-border legal-test\u000a      issues and finally developed a methodology and intervention to help SMEs\u000a      overcome\u000a      procurement-success inhibitors identified in Phase I.\u000a    This research led inter alia to the development of the bilingual Bangor\u000a      Law Tender Review\u000a      Instrument (TRI) and low value procurement tender design methodology,\u000a      following research\u000a      conducted with over 200 companies in Wales &amp; Ireland. The TRI\u000a      overcomes procurer feedback\u000a      deficiencies and assesses suppliers' tender submissions against a number\u000a      of criteria including\u000a      European Union Transparency of Tender Evaluation Criteria Jurisprudence,\u000a      Scoring Methodology\u000a      Relevancy\/Transparency Jurisprudence and ultimately involves a Final\u000a      Impact Analysis which\u000a      measures whether the participating SME's tendering strategy, behaviour\u000a      and\/or results have\u000a      changed for the better. The outcome of the entire 2008-2012 research\u000a      programme established\u000a      Bangor as a leader in procurement law and barrier research, with a\u000a      reputation as a trusted source\u000a      of advice for diverse non-academic communities., Our research was driving\u000a      policy change by\u000a      Government, changing poor public sector procurement practices and being\u000a      taken up internationally\u000a      by procurement policy formers and SME representative organisations. In\u000a      September 2013,\u000a      Bangor's contribution to the Winning in Tendering project was\u000a      runner-up in the industry-leading UK\u000a      Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply Awards category for Best\u000a      Procurement Project.\u000a    Key Insights\/Findings:\u000a    i. Low Transparency of Evaluation Criteria: We uncovered\u000a      significant evidence that public bodies in\u000a      Wales were not providing sufficient tender evaluation information,\u000a      contrary to European Court of\u000a      Justice case law, frustrating the application of Judicial Review\u000a      principles and creating an\u000a      unnecessary barrier to tendering by SMEs [a1, a2].\u000a    ii. Misinterpretation of European Law: We found overwhelming\u000a      evidence of widespread non-\u000a      advertising of `sub-OJEU-level' contracts across Wales (i.e., contracts\u000a      below &#163;130,000 which are\u000a      of the ideal size for SMEs because of their low value): this practice was\u000a      frequently contrary both to\u000a      the public sector's own organisation-specific financial standing orders on\u000a      advertising thresholds,\u000a      and also contrary to European case law on advertising contracts possessing\u000a      a `cross border'\u000a      interest element [a1, a2].\u000a    iii. Widespread use of Disproportionate Risk Thresholds: Our\u000a      research revealed that risk criteria\u000a      used in tenders were often disproportionate to the actual risk of contract\u000a      failure and hence were\u000a      unnecessarily locking out SMEs [a1, a2]. Given that 99% of Welsh\u000a      businesses are SMEs or micro-\u000a      businesses, this was having a significant negative impact on the Welsh\u000a      economy.\u000a    iv. Lack of Contract Standardisation: Public bodies, and even\u000a      units within the same public body,\u000a      were using widely different pre-qualification questions for requesting\u000a      essentially common data,\u000a      frustrating SME efforts to win tenders [a1, a2].\u000a    v. Method of Improving Tender Success Rates: We found that public\u000a      bodies were not providing\u000a      meaningful feedback to unsuccessful tenderers to enable them to optimise\u000a      future submissions. The\u000a      Bangor TRI overcomes this deficiency: an SME using the Bangor Law TRI will\u000a      increase its tender\u000a      success rate within a 12 month period, from typically winning 1 in every 5\u000a      tenders, to 2 in every 5\u000a      (i.e. doubling their win-rate) [a1, a2].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28054","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"934292","Name":"Mauritius"},{"GeoNamesId":"3439705","Name":"Uruguay"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"1966436","Name":"East Timor"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"3617476","Name":"Nicaragua"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The findings of DWDW are reflected within laws and legal policy debates\u000d\u000a      at both the international\u000d\u000a      and national levels.

Suggestions for legal drafting contained in\u000d\u000a      the `policy report' were\u000d\u000a      incorporated in the drafts of the Convention and Recommendation put before\u000d\u000a      the ILO International\u000d\u000a      Labour Conference (Decent Work for Domestic Workers, July 2011). The\u000d\u000a      `policy report', alongside\u000d\u000a      a summary version, was widely circulated by the ILO including to Committee\u000d\u000a      delegates, with the\u000d\u000a      ILO noting that \"Dr McCann's study has been indispensable to the ILO.\u000d\u000a        It shaped the international\u000d\u000a        standards and is influencing ILO policy at the international-level and\u000d\u000a        in countries across the world\"\u000d\u000a      [2]. The research underpins key provisions within international laws,\u000d\u000a      specifically Article 10 of ILO\u000d\u000a      Convention 189 and Articles 9-13 of Recommendation 201:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the requirement for equal treatment in hours limits\u000d\u000a      compensation and rest periods\u000d\u000a      the 24 hour weekly rest period\u000d\u000a      the classification of `on-call' hours as working time\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    At the national level, the Convention standards are binding on\u000d\u000a      ratifying states (i.e. the provisions\u000d\u000a      of the Convention must be reflected in national laws), with the convention\u000d\u000a      having thus far been\u000d\u000a      ratified by: the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Italy, Mauritius,\u000d\u000a      Nicaragua, the Philippines and\u000d\u000a      Uruguay. The Recommendation provides additional context and guidance for\u000d\u000a      legislators. These\u000d\u000a      international norms therefore directly influence the content of new legal\u000d\u000a      standards adopted in\u000d\u000a      domestic jurisdictions, such as in the Philippines &#8212; `An Act\u000d\u000a      Instituting Policies for the Protection and\u000d\u000a      Welfare of Domestic Workers (Republic Act 10361)' [3]. In addition, the\u000d\u000a      research is shaping policy\u000d\u000a      debates and substantive legal reforms at the national level, in part\u000d\u000a      through the ILO's efforts to\u000d\u000a      promote ratification and implementation of the new Convention and\u000d\u000a      Recommendation to Ministries\u000d\u000a      of Labour, national-level employers' organisations and trade unions. The\u000d\u000a      `policy brief' [C] and\u000d\u000a      subsequent guide to designing labour laws [4] is used by the ILO's network\u000d\u000a      of regional offices\u000d\u000a      (Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Arab States, Asia and the\u000d\u000a      Pacific, Europe and Central\u000d\u000a      Asia) when advising governments on how to reform their laws [2].\u000d\u000a      Accordingly, the provisions of\u000d\u000a      the Convention have been incorporated into national legislation even in\u000d\u000a      countries that have yet to\u000d\u000a      ratify the Convention, including in the `Spanish Royal Decree 1620'\u000d\u000a      (2011) on work in private\u000d\u000a      households [3], and `Thailand Ministerial Regulation No. 14 (B.E.\u000d\u000a      2555)' [3]. The Principle of\u000d\u000a      Universality devised by McCann and Murray [D] (p.14) and incorporated in\u000d\u000a      Convention No. 189,\u000d\u000a      Article 10(1), is also inspiring legal reform in Chile where\u000d\u000a      statutory hours limits traditionally exclude\u000d\u000a      domestic workers.

These organizations promoted the research\u000d\u000a      findings as a model for\u000d\u000a      national laws and working life in publications that disseminated to a\u000d\u000a      range of policy actors (national\u000d\u000a      governments, trade unions, national-level NGOs, etc.) [5]\u000d\u000a    The research is having a particularly substantial impact in Australia\u000d\u000a      as part of efforts at both the\u000d\u000a      federal and state levels to design regulatory frameworks for\u000d\u000a      `non-standard' work. In particular, the\u000d\u000a      report [D] was utilised by the United Voice union as part of its wage\u000d\u000a      justice campaign for workers in\u000d\u000a      the aged care sector [6]. The union used the Model Law in determining its\u000d\u000a      position on the first\u000d\u000a      review of the modern awards [labour standards] by the Australian Fair Work\u000d\u000a      Commission (January\u000d\u000a      2012, onwards), specifically, the `Aged Care Award' and `Social Community\u000d\u000a      Home Care and\u000d\u000a      Disability Services Award'. The research also informed the work of the\u000d\u000a      Australian Council of Trade\u000d\u000a      Unions' (ACTU) `Independent Inquiry into Insecure Work' [7]. The inquiry\u000d\u000a      was conducted by a\u000d\u000a      panel of experts and community members, and was chaired by former Deputy\u000d\u000a      Prime Minister Brian\u000d\u000a      Howe. A submission, drawn from the DWDW program, informed the Committee's\u000d\u000a      support for the\u000d\u000a      principles of decent work and universality of protection and the\u000d\u000a      associated call for an expansion of\u000d\u000a      the Australian National Employment Standards [8]. As a member of the panel\u000d\u000a      of experts attests: \"I\u000d\u000a        used McCann and Murray's Model Law extensively &#8212; both in the discussion\u000d\u000a        and on the panel &#8212; to\u000d\u000a        advocate for minimum standards on non-standard work...

In Timor-Leste,\u000d\u000a      the legal policy\u000d\u000a      advice outlined in the `policy report' was disseminated in September 2011\u000d\u000a      to the fourth Women and\u000d\u000a      Industrial Relations Conference `Our Work Our Lives' (Dili).

The research programme was led from UoM by Dr McCann, and\u000d\u000a      facilitated by a period\u000d\u000a      spent by Dr Murray as a visitor to the School of Law.\u000d\u000a    DWDW draws upon the collaborators' expertise on the regulation of working\u000d\u000a      conditions and\u000d\u000a      precarious work [E]. A focus was placed on the working time dimensions of\u000d\u000a      domestic work, noting\u000d\u000a      that across the globe &#8212; as outlined in the ILO report `Decent Work for\u000d\u000a      Domestic Workers' (2010) - domestic\u000d\u000a      work is characterised by working hours that are both excessive and highly\u000d\u000a      unpredictable.\u000d\u000a      WDW consequently sought to address and identify the most effective\u000d\u000a      regulatory mechanisms,\u000d\u000a      noting that the issue had become increasingly pressing in the light of\u000d\u000a      both the ongoing growth of\u000d\u000a      `global care chains', and an increased awareness of the habitual\u000d\u000a      mistreatment of domestic workers\u000d\u000a      (noted, for example, in the Human Rights Watch report As If I am Not\u000d\u000a      Human, 2008).\u000d\u000a    Hours of work are central to domestic workers' experience of working\u000d\u000a      life, and also a key concern\u000d\u000a      when seeking to improve the quality of domestic work. However, prior to\u000d\u000a      the DWDW programme\u000d\u000a      existing research on effective regulatory models was limited. Within most\u000d\u000a      labour law regimes,\u000d\u000a      domestic work had predominantly been subject to an `exclusionary model'\u000d\u000a      under which\u000d\u000a      transnational and domestic labour laws either entirely excluded domestic\u000d\u000a      workers, or limited their\u000d\u000a      range of entitlements (see, for example, the European Union Working Time\u000d\u000a      Directive, 2003). In\u000d\u000a      contrast, the DWDW programme put forward an original conceptual\u000d\u000a        framework for the regulation\u000d\u000a      of working time in domestic work, clearly establishing a set of policy\u000d\u000a      objectives that can be used to\u000d\u000a      underpin legal standards [C][D]. As outlined below, the research programme\u000d\u000a      also generated a\u000d\u000a      model regulatory framework that could be drawn upon by policy\u000d\u000a      actors in the designing of\u000d\u000a      legislative instruments or collective agreements.\u000d\u000a    In summary, the research generated three principal outcomes:\u000d\u000a    1. A conceptual framework centred on a set of key imperatives for\u000d\u000a        policy actors:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      To recognise work\/family reconciliation as an objective of working\u000d\u000a        time law\u000d\u000a      To isolate and address the working time dimensions of precariousness\u000d\u000a      To conceptualise the temporal dimensions of domestic work as an\u000d\u000a        unrestrained form of\u000d\u000a        working time flexibility\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    2. The research proposed a set of principles to underpin legal\u000d\u000a        reforms:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The legal recognition of the value of care-work\u000d\u000a      The value of work\/family reconciliation for domestic workers\u000d\u000a      The universality of legal protection\u000d\u000a      The importance of regulated flexibility\u000d\u000a      The need for innovative forms of regulation\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    3.

However, the same cannot be said for most European states, with\u000a      the COE CHR\u000a      expressing concern, in 2007, that cultures of police impunity had the\u000a      potential to emerge within\u000a      some member states. In line with these concerns, the work of Dr Graham\u000a      Smith was circulated and\u000a      discussed via a range of targeted engagements:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aWorkshop: Following recommendations by the European Court of\u000a        Human Rights (ECtHR),\u000a        `Council of Europe Committee of Ministers and the Committee for the\u000a        Prevention of Torture and\u000a        Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment', the CHR invited Smith to\u000a        serve as\u000a        rapporteur to an expert workshop on police complaints mechanisms,\u000a        attended by senior\u000a        practitioners from across Europe (including the heads of several police\u000a        complaints bodies). In\u000a        the workshop summary report the five principles of effective police\u000a        complaints investigation\u000a        were first presented [1].\u000a      \u000aOpinion: In the wake of this workshop, the CHR appointed Smith\u000a        to serve as his external\u000a        consultant on police complaints, and commissioned him to write an\u000a        Opinion (now translated\u000a        into 10 languages), which also examined existing police complaints\u000a        mechanisms across\u000a        Europe and ECHR case law [E]. The CHR thematic co-ordinator has praised\u000a        this work,\u000a        suggesting that Smith's \"...contribution to the Commissioner's\u000a          opinion on police complaints\u000a          mechanisms and its dissemination was essential... [and was]\u000a          based on independent research\u000a          and the results of the Commissioner's workshop on the subject.\"\u000a        [1]\u000a      \u000aResearch: Subsequently, Smith published articles on the CHR's\u000a        police complaints initiative in\u000a        two practitioner journals [2], and subsequent to the Opinion's\u000a        publication, Greater Manchester\u000a        Police (GMP) opened negotiations to investigate disproportionality on\u000a        grounds of ethnicity in\u000a        misconduct proceedings.\u000a    \u000a    Pathways to Impact: These activities led to a range of additional\u000a      outlets:\u000a    \u000a      In June\/July 2010, Smith provided a plenary, and served as the\u000a        moderator of the `police'\u000a        pathway (one of three pathways, encompassing two days of workshops) at\u000a        the `EU &#8212; Brazil\u000a        Human Rights Civil Society Seminar' jointly organised by the Brazil\u000a        Secretariat for Human\u000a        Rights and the European Commission Human Rights Unit (Brasilia).\u000a      In November 2011, Smith participated as a member of the review panel\u000a        in the Organisation for\u000a        Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OCSE) `Human Rights and the\u000a        Investigation of Terrorist\u000a        Crimes: A Practical Manual for Law Enforcement Officers' panel.\u000a      In March 2012, Smith gave a keynote speech at the EU\/UNDP\u000a        `Strengthening Palestinian\u000a        Police Accountability' workshop in Ramallah, alongside two additional\u000a        sessions, and has been\u000a        invited back to follow-up the `Three-Year Strategic Plan for\u000a        Strengthening the Accountability\u000a        of the Palestinian Civil Police' sketched out at the workshop. For the\u000a        conference, paper [B] was\u000a        translated into Arabic.\u000a      In April 2013, Smith presented research to a COE round table (Tbilisi,\u000a        Georgia), alongside\u000a        delegates from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova and Ukraine. This led to an\u000a        invitation to research\u000a        police complaints mechanisms in these five countries and to prepare a\u000a        report, subsequently\u000a        discussed in Baku (Azerbaijan), to assist with the development of these\u000a        new mechanisms [3].\u000a    \u000a    Primary Impact: During this period, the research led to a raft of\u000a      invitations to train police officers:\u000a    \u000a      Between 2010 and 2012 Smith conducted training for the Office of\u000a          the Police Ombudsman for\u000a          Northern Ireland (OPONI); and in November 2012 gave two\u000a        presentations to personnel. Taken\u000a        together, this work was highly praised, emerging from a long-standing\u000a        engagement with\u000a        Smith's Opinion for the ECR. As the Ombudsman attests:\u000a        [This] has been a key reference for many of the activities of\u000a          OPONI... [Dr Smith] has also\u000a          been a helpful expert in training sessions for the Office and of\u000a          course this could not have\u000a          been accomplished without his expertise and research forming a\u000a          background for his evident\u000a          connection with our investigators.... As we struggle to apply ECHR\u000a          principles\u000a          retrospectively to alleged police crimes from 1968 through 1998, in a\u000a          highly charged\u000a          political environment, Graham has provided sage advice and discussion\u000a          with myself and\u000a          our Director of Historical Investigations. None of this could be\u000a          accomplished without solid\u000a          research efforts and a broad understanding of the different police\u000a          oversight mechanisms\u000a          and their principles available around the world. [4]\u000a      In June 2012 &amp; March 2013, Smith gave two workshops within the\u000a        third phase of training\u000a        Bahraini police officers (senior and frontline, respectively).\u000a      In February 2013, Smith participated in a four day `Independent\u000a        Commission of Investigations'\u000a        training event in Kingston (Jamaica), leading for two of the days with\u000a        workshops on\u000a        independent and effective investigation of police complaints, and\u000a        citizen oversight.\u000a      In February 2013, Smith participated in the `Exercise Gaudi' element\u000a        of the Police Strategic\u000a        Command Course (College of Policing, Bramshill); the equality and\u000a        diversity component of the\u000a        Chief Superintendant training programme.\u000a      In March 2013, Smith gave a presentation on GMP DIPPS research to a\u000a        regional professional\u000a        standards meeting of Cleveland, Northumbria, Durham, N. Yorkshire, W.\u000a        Yorkshire and\u000a        Humberside police services.\u000a      In June 2013, Smith led three working groups on DIPPS at the ACPO\u000a        national conference on\u000a        professional standards, later summarised in the largest circulation\u000a        police weekly [5]\u000a    \u000a    Similarly, work with GMP (and others) examining disproportionality in\u000a      professional Standards has\u000a      been highly praised. In March 2013, GMP's Chief Constable accepted the\u000a      report's findings:\u000a    We have been very clear that disproportionality in discipline issues\u000a        has existed in GMP\u000a        and... the research carried out by Graham Smith is helping us to\u000a        understand some of the\u000a        underlying causes which are complex and wrapped up in a host of cultural\u000a        issues... We\u000a        believe it is better that this issue is openly debated and welcome\u000a        further research and\u000a        discussion with other employers. [6]\u000a    Likewise, the President of the National Black Police Association noted\u000a      that: \"The research report is\u000a      now the subject of working groups to address disproportionality in\u000a      Constabularies across the UK\",\u000a      going on to note how Dr Smith's research has \"reignited important\u000a        debates\":\u000a    The issue of disproportionality in Police Professional Standards has\u000a        been identified by the\u000a        National Black Police Association (NBPA) over many years but in the\u000a        absence of academic\u000a        research in this area, NBPA and community activist struggled to\u000a        influence Government and\u000a        Police Policy. Dr Smith's report provided a powerful reference point ...\u000a        the National Black\u000a      Police Association has been able to strengthen its argument for more\u000a        urgency on the part\u000a        of The Home Office and Police Leaders in terms of implementing policies\u000a        to drastically\u000a        improve minority representation in Policing and Police Leadership. An\u000a        example of this is the\u000a        recognition now, by Senior Police Leaders in Greater Manchester Police\u000a        and Metropolitan\u000a        Police of a 'Diversity Crisis in Policing' and moves towards addressing\u000a        this. [7]\u000a    Secondary Impact: The CHR Opinion document has been cited in legal\u000a      and policy contexts:\u000a    \u000a      Firstly, following his visits to COE member states, the CHR\u000a        has cited the Opinion when\u000a        recommending more effective investigation of police forces, and the\u000a        creation of independent\u000a        complaints bodies [8]; the CHR thematic co-ordinator noting that \"The\u000a          Opinion is used by the\u000a          Commissioner in his country monitoring and has become a central\u000a          reference document in\u000a          many member states which are contemplating or carrying out reforms in\u000a          this field\" [2].\u000a      Secondly, the Opinion has been used by Amnesty International,\u000a        a member of their policy\u000a        team affirming that: \"We have used it here several times when making\u000a          recommendations on\u000a          various countries (most recently Greece and Germany) and it is really\u000a          so useful as a lobbying\u000a          (and learning) document. It's... USABLE, which from an NGO standpoint\u000a          is very important (and\u000a          it nicely incorporates the specifics of the relevant ECtHR\u000a          jurisprudence)' [9].\u000a      Thirdly, the research has been picked up in a range of international\u000a        arenas. The UN Special\u000a          Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions used\u000a        the research in support of\u000a        an independent police complaints body, and proposed guidelines for\u000a        governments on the\u000a        creation and operation of effective external complaints mechanisms. The\u000a        support in the\u000a        Opinion for the existence of an independent police complaints body was\u000a        favourably cited in a\u000a        report to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Emergency Planning,\u000a        with the chair of the\u000a        enquiry noting that Dr Smith's CHR work had been \"an important\u000a          inspiration for the\u000a          commission\" with the report subsequently recommending the creation\u000a        of a more independent\u000a        complaints system in Norway. Finally, Dr Smith gave a live video-link\u000a        presentation to the\u000a        Victoria Office of Police Integrity Forum, (Melbourne, Australia)\u000a        regarding the independent\u000a        and effective investigation of deaths associated with police contact; a\u000a        subsequent `Issues\u000a        Paper' cited the Opinion and `Every Complaint Matters' (reference [B],\u000a        above) [10]\u000a      More recently, Smith has engaged directly with solicitors who\u000a        required an expert report on\u000a        behalf of a police officer they are representing in civil proceedings.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Fair and effective complaints procedures are essential to maintaining\u000a      public trust and confidence in\u000a      the police, protecting against cultures of impunity and establishing\u000a      accountability. Research\u000a      undertaken at the University of Manchester (UoM) has formulated a\u000a      regulatory approach to police\u000a      complaints determination that is fair, effective and human rights\u000a      compliant. The research has two\u000a      strands. Firstly, considering complaints law and practice across Europe,\u000a      via engagement with the\u000a      Council of Europe (COE) Commissioner for Human Rights (CHR). Secondly, an\u000a      assessment of\u000a      internal misconduct investigations, focusing specifically on Greater\u000a      Manchester Police (GMP).\u000a    Work undertaken with the CHR, notably the generation of an Opinion\u000a      `Concerning Independent\u000a      and Effective Determination of Complaints against the Police' has been\u000a      picked up and utilised\u000a      internationally by a range of governmental and non-governmental bodies,\u000a      and is being used within\u000a      a raft of training engagements. The report `Disproportionality in Police\u000a      Professional Standards' has\u000a      formed the basis for both ongoing internal discussion, and wider\u000a      considerations concerning the\u000a      issue of disproportionality within the professions.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Manchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Manchester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007798}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"611717","Name":"Tbilisi"},{"GeoNamesId":"282239","Name":"Ramallah"},{"GeoNamesId":"587084","Name":"Baku"},{"GeoNamesId":"2158177","Name":"Melbourne"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469058","Name":"Brasilia"}],"References":"\u000a    The research has been published in leading criminology and regulation\u000a      journals, official COE\u000a      documents and police research reports.\u000a    \u000a[A] (2012) Smith, G., Hagger Johnson, H. &amp; Roberts, C.\u000a      `Disproportionality in Police Professional\u000a      Standards: An Investigation of Internally Raised Misconduct Proceedings in\u000a      Greater\u000a      Manchester Police...'

The key researchers are Dr Graham Smith (Senior\u000a      Lecturer, 2005-date); Dr\u000a      Harry Hagger Johnson (Research Associate, 2011-2012); and Professor Chris\u000a      Roberts (Institute of\u000a      Population Health, 1988-)\u000a    Applying insights from a practice background, Dr Smith established the\u000a      idea that police complaints\u000a      procedures serve as regulatory as well as accountability mechanisms.\u000a      Drawing upon European\u000a      Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) case law, five principles of independent\u000a      and effective\u000a      investigation of police complaints were subsequently developed: These\u000a      were: independence:\u000a      (institutional, hierarchical and practical); adequacy (regarding\u000a      the gathering of evidence, and\u000a      ability to punish); promptness (to maintain trust and confidence);\u000a      public scrutiny (via open and\u000a      transparent procedures); victim involvement (to safeguard their\u000a      legitimate interests). Taken as a\u000a      whole, the research suggested that:\u000a    \u000a      Developments in police complaints determination in England and Wales\u000a        (since the late 1990s)\u000a        are relevant to regulatory, performance and service delivery, as well as\u000a        enforcement and\u000a        accountability objectives. Accordingly, an increased emphasis has been\u000a        placed on lesson\u000a          learning and the prevention of misconduct, instead of the punishment\u000a          of officers. [C][D]\u000a      This preventative approach is also being developed in the case law of\u000a        the ECHR, in regard to\u000a        the procedural obligations of contracting states to protect the right to\u000a        life, and against torture,\u000a        inhuman and degrading treatment. The five principles of independent\u000a          and effective\u000a          investigation of complaints were shown to provide the basis for a\u000a          framework for the fair\u000a          and effective determination of all complaints, under the auspices\u000a        of an independent police\u000a        complaints body. [B][E]\u000a      A two-tier disciplinary system, based not on different types of\u000a        wrongdoing but on the ethnicity of\u000a        alleged wrongdoers, was perceived to apply to the determination of\u000a        internally raised police\u000a        misconduct allegations in a project commissioned by Greater Manchester,\u000a        West Midlands and\u000a        British Transport Police services. It was recommended that police\u000a          services pursue a\u000a          regulatory approach to misconduct, with professional standards\u000a          departments seeking to\u000a          proactively prevent wrongdoing. [A]\u000a    \u000a    The most recent research has led to a renewed emphasis on the issue of\u000a      disproportionality\u000a      (disparate treatment in employment and regulatory practices), noting inter\u000a        alia that Asian officers\u000a      and staff within GMP were 2.8 and 3.6 times more likely than white\u000a      officers and staff, respectively,\u000a      to be investigated for corruption, and ethnic minority officers at GMP\u000a      felt they were more likely to\u000a      be formally investigated for wrongdoing, whereas white officers were dealt\u000a      with informally [A].\u000a    This work led to a UoM conference `Disproportionality and Misconduct in\u000a      the Professions:\u000a      Understanding and Responding to Difference' (March, 2013); with plans to\u000a      further this work,\u000a      recognising that stakeholder responses in specific professions differ in\u000a      their understandings of the\u000a      causes of disparate treatment, and the remedies required when dealing with\u000a      accusations. This is a\u000a      pressing issue at a time when the scope of many professional bodies is\u000a      shifting.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28056","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Pathway to Impact: The research has resulted in significant\u000d\u000a      developments relating to the care and treatment of extremely premature\u000d\u000a      babies and to an enhanced role for parental decision making. It has been\u000d\u000a      deliberated upon, and adapted through the applied policy recommendations\u000d\u000a      contained within a ground-breaking NCOB report [A]; overseen by Professor\u000d\u000a      Brazier, who was invited to chair the NCOB working party, and co-opted as\u000d\u000a      a member of the council to facilitate communication between the two, a\u000d\u000a      task achieved with \"considerable skill...

An extensive programme of consultation was initiated, including\u000d\u000a      European debate, which sought the view of parents, professionals and NHS\u000d\u000a      managers. The report played a major role in the amendment and development\u000d\u000a      of professional guidelines and good practice, and was subsequently\u000d\u000a      summarised via an editorial piece in the Journal of Medical Ethics\u000d\u000a      [3].\u000d\u000a    Impact of NCOB Report: As the co-author of the JME piece attests\u000d\u000a      Professor Brazier's role was \"pivotal in the success of the report...\u000d\u000a        a report that integrated a wealth of findings into a coherent and\u000d\u000a        compelling narrative with a set of clear suggestions for policy... its\u000d\u000a        success led to its having a huge influence across the relevant domains\u000d\u000a        of medical practice and policy regulation. No organisation or individual\u000d\u000a        concerned with the matters under review ignores it, and most cite it as\u000d\u000a        a canonical statement of what can be and what ought to be done\" [3].\u000d\u000a      More specifically, Professor Brazier contributed to the chapter on ethics,\u000d\u000a      and researched and drafted chapter eight on law, as well as supervising\u000d\u000a      the overall production of the final report. Although, as a member of the\u000d\u000a      working party (and former President of BAPM) testifies, whilst Professor\u000d\u000a      Brazier's \"contribution was formally in the section on Legal\u000d\u000a        issues, which was one of the cornerstones of the final document... her\u000d\u000a        perceptive inputs to the remainder of the document and her ability to\u000d\u000a        steer a big multidisciplinary group to consensus were most impressive.\u000d\u000a        She was a highly active contributor and challenger throughout the\u000d\u000a        process\" [4].\u000d\u000a    The report resulted in a high level of media interest which promoted\u000d\u000a      vigorous public and professional debate, and kept the subject on the\u000d\u000a      public and professional agenda. Professor Brazier gave a number of public\u000d\u000a      lectures, took part in the BBC radio programmes `Today' and `The Moral\u000d\u000a      Maze' and was interviewed by several newspapers, including The Telegraph,\u000d\u000a      and The Independent [5]. More recently, the report featured in the BBC2\u000d\u000a      documentary `23 Week Babies: The Price of Life' (2010) watched by 2.02\u000d\u000a      million viewers [1][6].\u000d\u000a    Within the NCOB report, detailed guidance was offered to assist in the\u000d\u000a      definition of `best interests', and amongst the report's main\u000d\u000a        recommendations were that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Guidance should reflect the current medical understanding of the\u000d\u000a        prospects for survival and the incidence of disability for babies born\u000d\u000a        extremely prematurely.\u000d\u000a      From 24 weeks gestation the presumption should be that intensive\u000d\u000a        neonatal support should be instituted for the baby.\u000d\u000a      From 23-24 weeks precedence should be given to parental wishes.\u000d\u000a      From 22-23 weeks intensive neonatal support should not be instituted\u000d\u000a        unless the parents make a fully informed and re-iterated request.\u000d\u000a      Below 22 weeks no baby should be resuscitated save with the fully\u000d\u000a        informed consent of both parents and within an approved clinical trial.\u000d\u000a      To minimise recourse to traumatic legal proceedings, the parties\u000d\u000a        should have readier access to clinical ethics committees.\u000d\u000a      Bioethics mediation, now utilised in parts of the USA, should be\u000d\u000a        introduced in the UK.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Reach and Significance: The NCOB Report is now cited in virtually\u000d\u000a      all accounts and debates relating to the care of extremely premature\u000d\u000a      babies - 176 articles and 10 legal documents since 2006 [2] - and has been\u000d\u000a      downloaded at least 2,212 times (with 23,274 page views) since September\u000d\u000a      2010 (no download data is available prior to this time) [1][7].\u000d\u000a    As the NCOB director confirms: \"The British Association of Perinatal\u000d\u000a        Medicine (BAPM) and several other organisations took up the Council's\u000d\u000a        recommendations and worked together to draw up new medical guidance in\u000d\u000a        2008 on the management of extremely premature babies, closely following\u000d\u000a        the recommendations made in the Council's report\" [1]. This is\u000d\u000a      recognised by BAPM in their palliative care framework:\u000d\u000a    Recent guidance from the Nuffield Council of Bioethics (Nuffield 2006)\u000d\u000a        and the British Association of Perinatal Medicine working group on the\u000d\u000a        clinical care of extremely preterm infants supports the decisions of\u000d\u000a        clinical staff and parents not to resuscitate or institute intensive\u000d\u000a        care when this would not be in the baby's best interests. The Department\u000d\u000a        of Health is developing guidance on end-of-life care for adults but not\u000d\u000a        yet for the fetus, neonate, or infant. [8]\u000d\u000a    As the BAPM secretary noted at the time: \"the Nuffield Council for\u000d\u000a        Bioethics advised us to develop an update to our previous document\u000d\u000a        (2001). We were able to discuss the draft with members of the NCoB\u000d\u000a        Working Group in December and are delighted that they were very\u000d\u000a        supportive of the progress and direction of the framework\" (BAPM\u000d\u000a      Newsletter). This led to the BAPM promulgating guidance on `The Management\u000d\u000a      of Babies Born Extremely Preterm...' in August 2008, which remains in\u000d\u000a      place to this day [8]. As noted, it closely follows NCOB guidance, and\u000d\u000a      thus represents the translation of research into practical impact in\u000d\u000a      neonatal care. Crucially, the BAPM framework mirrors the NCOB timeline and\u000d\u000a      the criteria to be utilised in the assessment of `best interests'. The\u000d\u000a      former President of BAPM confirms that the NCOB report significantly\u000d\u000a      influenced BAPM, and that the ensuing guidelines have had an impact on\u000d\u000a      practice in neonatal care:\u000d\u000a    \"This document remains the reference document in a range of settings\u000d\u000a        and is very frequently quoted in talks and publications as the benchmark\u000d\u000a        in the field. No lecture on perinatal ethics in this country or abroad\u000d\u000a        fails to refer to it, even if it is just as a starting point. The\u000d\u000a        document formed the basis of the professional document prepared under\u000d\u000a        the aegis of BAPM, RCPCH, RCOG, RCM, and RCN, entitled Management of\u000d\u000a        babies born extremely preterm at less than 26 weeks of gestation: a\u000d\u000a        framework for clinical practice at the time of birth, published in\u000d\u000a        Archives of Disease in Childhood, which is still the mainstay of UK\u000d\u000a        policy today... The document from this working group remains one of the\u000d\u000a        most influential documents in perinatal care since it was published and\u000d\u000a        required reading for all trainees in the area.\" [3]\u000d\u000a    The report has also been considered in detail by the Royal College of\u000d\u000a      Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) &#8212; with a recognition that the\u000d\u000a      Nuffield \"recommendations have recently been considered and adopted in\u000d\u000a        the development of a professional framework for care\" [9] -and\u000d\u000a      welcomed by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), who\u000d\u000a      noted that the \"advice is consistent with the current RCPCH framework\u000d\u000a        for `Withholding or Withdrawing Life Sustaining Treatment' (2004)\"\u000d\u000a      [10].\u000d\u000a    In conclusion, the NCOB Guidelines draw heavily on Professor Brazier's\u000d\u000a      prior work and her individual and steering contribution to the NCOB\u000d\u000a      report. Furthermore, impacts are clearly on-going as a recent article\u000d\u000a      (2012) in the Telegraph attests; \"with no legal definition of 'viable'\u000d\u000a        when it comes to premature babies\", an experienced neonatal\u000d\u000a      consultant observes that:\u000d\u000a    \"...most decisions he and the unit take are based on guidelines from\u000d\u000a        the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, revised by the British Association of\u000d\u000a        Perinatal Medicine.

The role of the law\u000d\u000a      relating to the care of infants, and who should speak on their behalf,\u000d\u000a      cannot be divorced from this wider context unless the neonate is not to be\u000d\u000a      regarded as a legal person at birth. Ongoing developments in neonatal\u000d\u000a      medicine enable doctors to resuscitate babies born at ever earlier stages\u000d\u000a      in gestation, and to keep alive babies with very severe impairments. Such\u000d\u000a      developments generate legal and ethical questions relating to the status\u000d\u000a      of the fetus\/neonate and the rights of parents to make decisions about the\u000d\u000a      treatment of their infant. This research strongly endorses the granting of\u000d\u000a      a legal personality at birth, rejecting ethical arguments on moral\u000d\u000a      personhood as basis for law [D][E]. The initial research was conducted by\u000d\u000a      Professor Margot Brazier (currently Professor, and former director of the\u000d\u000a      Centre for Social Ethics and Policy), joined from the 4th\u000d\u000a      (2007) edition of her seminal work Medicine Patients and the Law\u000d\u000a      by Dr Emma Cave (Reader, Durham University), with ongoing work developed\u000d\u000a      in tandem; recognising that it is crucial legal and ethical analysis keeps\u000d\u000a      apace with medical developments [A].\u000d\u000a    Taken as a whole, the research sought to identify and assess:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      How critical care decisions relating to the resuscitation of\u000d\u000a        extremely premature and \/or sick neonates might best be made in\u000d\u000a        conformity to key legal and ethical principles.\u000d\u000a      How far parents or doctors should be regarded as the principal\u000d\u000a          decision makers.\u000d\u000a      How communication between parents and professionals can be\u000d\u000a        improved, and the risk of legal conflict minimised [B].\u000d\u000a      The difficult dilemmas posed in the context of debates of fetal\u000d\u000a          viability and late abortions (see point 2, below).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Overall, the research focused upon how far conflict can be minimised and\u000d\u000a      how parents and doctors might effectively work in partnership, whilst\u000d\u000a      ensuring that the practical and `real life' factors inherent within such\u000d\u000a      human tragedies are fully taken into account. The principal results\u000d\u000a      of the research are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The neonate (unlike the fetus) once `born alive' does and should enjoy\u000d\u000a          full legal personality.\u000d\u000a      The lack of clarity about the legal test of `born alive' may need Parliamentary\u000a          intervention as the case law is in many cases of great antiquity,\u000d\u000a        and unfit to address the challenges posed by modern medicine.\u000d\u000a      The legal test of best interests is in need of further\u000d\u000a        clarification and expansion, and the thorny problems of parental and\u000d\u000a        sibling interests should not be avoided.\u000d\u000a      Decisions about resuscitation should be made where possible by\u000d\u000a        parents and doctors together.\u000d\u000a      Decisions about withholding or withdrawing intensive neonatal care\u000d\u000a        should be made where possible by parents and doctors together.\u000d\u000a      \u000aParental views should carry great weight, as it is the parents\u000d\u000a        who will have to care for the child should s\/he survive with significant\u000d\u000a        disabilities.\u000d\u000a      Much greater emphasis should be placed on communication between\u000d\u000a          professionals and parents as many conflicts that end up in the\u000d\u000a        courts derive from communication failures.\u000d\u000a      Simple and accessible guidelines were needed to assist decision\u000d\u000a        making and these might well be best drawn from professional guidance\u000d\u000a        drafted with substantial lay input.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28057","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context: Government policy for the past decade has promoted the\u000a      use of alternative dispute\u000a      resolution methods, especially mediation. In the areas of SEN and ASN\u000a      there is a statutory right of\u000a      appeal to a tribunal against local authority decisions. There is also a\u000a      parallel mediation route. This\u000a      research confirmed the disputatious nature of SEN\/ASN decision making and\u000a      its underlying\u000a      reasons.\u000a    Pathways to Impact and Dissemination: The findings were\u000a      disseminated as the research\u000a      progressed, including through the posting of working papers at regular\u000a      intervals on the project's\u000a      website and also via the ESRC website. In October 2009 Professor Harris\u000a      organised the\u000a      dissemination of results conference at UoM. All delegates and speakers\u000a      received a copy of the\u000a      briefing paper [1] which was subsequently cited in the Government's Green\u000a      Paper on SEN (March\u000a      2011) in its discussion of policy on mediation [2]. Attendees at the\u000a      conference included local\u000a      authorities, government officials, mediation organisations, academics, a\u000a      senior tribunal judge and\u000a      members of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council (AJTC).\u000a      Impact on advice to parents: In 2009 Professor Harris was invited\u000a      to a meeting with senior\u000a      members of the tribunal judiciary, including Judge Phillip Sycamore &#8212; the\u000a      President of the Tribunal,\u000a      and the Deputy President with responsibility for SEN cases (the SEND\u000a      jurisdiction), to discuss the\u000a      research findings. The Deputy President later noted that:\u000a    \"The research did indeed have an impact. It not only raised awareness\u000a        of mediation but\u000a        prompted further contact between the Tribunal and mediators who have\u000a        forms of block\u000a        contracts with Local Authorities. Initially we designed a letter which\u000a        now accompanies each\u000a        registration of an appeal with an exhortation to reconsider mediation.\u000a        This raised mediation\u000a        from around 2 or 3% to something around 5%.\" [3]\u000a    Around 3,000 appeals are registered each year and there is now a standard\u000a      letter by the Deputy\u000a      President sent to all appellants advising them of the availability of\u000a      mediation arranged by the local\u000a      authority, and recommending its take-up. The research has therefore\u000a      prompted this policy so that\u000a      cases with a potential for settlement can be resolved more quickly. The\u000a      Deputy President also\u000a      confirms that in pilot areas a direction to receive information on\u000a      mediation has been issued to\u000a      parties to an appeal, which has been \"very successful and around 18%\u000a        of cases given this\u000a        mediation direction then enter mediation\", and also confirms the\u000a      influence of [A]: \"I have found the\u000a        book you have written very interesting and with real value for SEND in\u000a        formulating our approach on\u000a        a strategic basis\" [3].\u000a    Impact on justice system: Professor Harris was also invited to\u000a      meet with the AJTC in August\u000a      2010. The Council's previous interest in the research was evidenced by its\u000a      contribution of two\u000a      speakers at the results dissemination conference. Its 2009-2010 Annual\u000a      Report to the Lord\u000a      Chancellor and others referred to the research, describing the (October\u000a      2009) dissemination event\u000a      as having been \"of particular interest to us both in respect of our\u000a        oversight of the First-tier\u000a        Tribunal... and our wider interest in the promotion of ADR as an\u000a        alternative to tribunal hearings\"\u000a      [4]. Harris' contribution to the AJTC's thinking is also acknowledged in\u000a      the Council's 2012 report\u000a      `Putting it Right &#8212; A Strategic Approach' [5]. The research itself &#8212;\u000a      particularly the book and the\u000a      briefing paper [A][1] &#8212; is discussed at length, prior to the Council's\u000a      conclusions and\u000a      recommendations concerning mediation; a juxtaposition indicative of its\u000a      growing impact.\u000a    Influencing Government policy: In its March 2011 SEN Green Paper\u000a      (Cm 8027) the Government\u000a      consulted on making entry into mediation a pre-condition to appealing. A\u000a      senior Department for\u000a      Education (DfE) policy official wrote:\u000a    \"I am happy to confirm that two of your articles &#8212; Is Mediation in\u000a        Need of Promotion? with\u000a        Sheila Riddell and Resolving Disputes about Special Educational Needs\u000a        and Provision in\u000a        England with Emily Smith (Education Law Journal 2009) [D][E] &#8212;\u000a        were, and continue to\u000a        be, important in helping us to develop our thinking on our proposal for\u000a        compulsory\u000a        mediation before parents can register appeals at the Tribunal.\" [6]\u000a    He also asked if Professor Harris would agree to be a `sounding board'\u000a      for further ideas as they\u000a      develop.\u000a    Further influence on policy thinking around the research has arisen from\u000a      Harris' invited keynote\u000a      speech in London (26th January 2012), at a Westminster\u000a      Education Forum (WEF) focusing on the\u000a      Green Paper proposals, chaired by the Shadow Minister for Children and\u000a      Families and a Member\u000a      of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Learning Disability. WEF seminar\u000a      attendees typically\u000a      include members of both Houses of Parliament, senior government officials\u000a      and representatives of\u000a      Ofsted and Ofqual, together with other stakeholders. Professor Harris'\u000a      speech related the research\u000a      to the Government's policy intention of making the system less\u000a      adversarial.\u000a    Initially, in September 2012 the Government published draft legislation\u000a      on SEN (Cm 8438) which\u000a      would, inter alia, have made entry into mediation a compulsory\u000a      pre-requisite to an appeal.\u000a      Subsequently, the policy was modified and the draft Children and Families\u000a      Bill (1st Reading, 5th\u000a      February 2013) replaced this requirement with one stating that the parent\u000a      or young person be\u000a      provided with information or advice about pursuing mediation (and if they\u000a      opt for mediation, to have\u000a      taken part in it) before an appeal may be brought. Professor Harris, at\u000a      the express invitation of the\u000a      DfE, made in the light of his research and expertise [7], attended a\u000a      meeting with the Department\u000a      and regional mediation providers in June 2013 to discuss the arrangements\u000a      for mediation under\u000a      this new framework. He subsequently made recommendations to the DfE which\u000a      were taken on\u000a      board in July 2013 in the framing of the draft new Code of Practice of SEN\u000a      to which all local\u000a      authorities and schools will be required to have regard. A senior DfE\u000a      policy official notes that these\u000a      recommendations, communicated on 16th July 2013, were: \"considered...within\u000a        the next couple of\u000a        days and the majority of them were taken on board at that time and\u000a        reflected in the revised text of\u000a        the Code which came round for further comment\" [8].\u000a    In the light of all these developments the research can be seen to\u000a        have had a significant\u000a        impact in influencing thinking on policy and practice in an important\u000a        field of dispute\u000a        resolution.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken at the University of Manchester (UoM) considers the\u000a      use of mediation for\u000a      citizen versus state disputes outside the context of the courts, and\u000a      efforts to render an appeals\u000a      system less adversarial.

The\u000a      researchers were: Professor Neville Harris (2000-date), Emily Smith\u000a      (Research Assistant, 2008-2009)\u000a      and Professor Sheila Riddell (The University of Edinburgh). This research\u000a      was conducted for\u000a      an ESRC-funded project `Dispute Resolution and Avoidance in Education: A\u000a      Study of SEN and\u000a      ASN in England and Scotland' (RES-062-23-0803, &#163;313,942). The funding\u000a      split between the two\u000a      institutions was 50:50.\u000a    Professors Harris and Riddell both contributed to the wider\u000a      consideration, analysis and\u000a      presentation of the research findings. The fieldwork in England, where one\u000a      in five children have\u000a      SEN, included surveys of 150 local authorities and parent support\u000a      services, and in-depth interviews\u000a      (some grouped into case studies) with key professionals, judges, local\u000a      authorities, parents and\u000a      others.\u000a    The researchers found that despite being available for a number of years\u000a      and although actively\u000a      advocated by ministers and others, mediation was not being widely used for\u000a      resolving disputes.\u000a      The key reasons found by the research included:\u000a    \u000a       A failure by local authorities to promote its use despite a legal\u000a          obligation to make it\u000a          known to parents. The reasons for this varied from cynicism about\u000a        its value, for example\u000a        because there was perceived to be little scope for compromise, to a\u000a        concern at the cost of\u000a        mediations which must be borne by the authority. [A][B][C][D]\u000a       A low take-up due to a lack of knowledge or trust in the process\u000a          among parents. The\u000a        researchers found this was borne not just out of ignorance, but also a\u000a        preference among\u000a        advisers and representatives for the appeal process, which leads to a\u000a        binding decision.\u000a        [A][B][D][E]\u000a       A wide-scale but largely unrecognised degree of successful\u000a          dispute resolution through\u000a        informal negotiation between parents and local authorities, often\u000a        facilitated in England by\u000a        parent partnership services. This removes the need for formal mediation.\u000a        [A][E]\u000a    \u000a    The research identified circumstances where mediation would or would not\u000a      be appropriate and the\u000a      wide-ranging pros and cons regarding its use as compared with the\u000a      First-tier Tribunal (Health,\u000a      Education and Social Care Chamber) in England and ASN Tribunal in\u000a      Scotland. It examined the\u000a      conduciveness of mediation to just outcomes to disputes. It also explored\u000a      the socio-economic\u000a      context to dispute resolution, children's rights perspectives and how\u000a      mediation fits into theories of\u000a      administrative justice.\u000a    The two most important recommendations to ensure that mediation could\u000a        have a\u000a        meaningful role in the future were: firstly, that it should be\u000a        better promoted, to ensure greater\u000a      awareness and understanding of it and increased take-up; secondly, that it\u000a      should be available as\u000a        a stage in the appeal process itself, provided it does not unduly\u000a      lengthen the process as a whole.\u000a      [A][D][E]\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28083","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Family visitor appeals: This research was referred to extensively\u000a      in a consultation paper issued\u000a      in 2010 by the Ministry of Justice on the re-introduction of fees for\u000a      immigration appeals, and\u000a      comprised part of the evidence base for that consultation. Concerns had\u000a      been raised that appeals\u000a      fees restrict access to justice. The consultation paper said that there\u000a      was a sound policy reason to\u000a      set fees initially at a level considerably below the full cost of\u000a      particular appeals and it drew directly\u000a      upon the research. According to the consultation paper:\u000a    \"In reaching this decision, we took into account that fees were\u000a        introduced by the previous\u000a        Government for Family Visit Visa appeals in 2000. Suggestions were\u000a        raised that those with\u000a        legitimate claims were being deterred from appealing. Research was\u000a        undertaken between\u000a        August 2001 and January 2002, with the results published as a Home\u000a        Office paper in 2003\u000a      [paper 6 above]... The paper found no conclusive evidence that the fee\u000a        was a deterrent to\u000a        legitimate appeals.\" [1]\u000a    The research findings were then directly utilised by the Ministry of\u000a      Justice, with a consultation\u000a      paper noting that \"the research found no clear evidence that the fee\u000a        in itself was a deterrent to\u000a        making an appeal.\" Fees were subsequently reintroduced through\u000a      secondary legislation, prior to\u000a      the removal of the appeal right altogether in 2013. Ultimately applicants\u000a      will be encouraged to re-apply, avoiding the need for an appeal procedure.\u000a    Asylum appeals: The principal beneficiary of the research has been\u000a      the Upper Tribunal. Given the\u000a      unique and innovative nature of the country guidance system &#8212; relying on\u000a      factual precedent\u000a      concerning the conditions in countries from which asylum claimants seek\u000a      refuge &#8212; the Tribunal\u000a      must manage the process carefully in order to reconcile competing aims\u000a      such as individual justice,\u000a      consistency, efficiency and flexibility. The research recommended that the\u000a      Tribunal adopt\u000a      innovative methods of managing its country guidance system.\u000a    The research was presented to the Administrative Justice &amp; Tribunals\u000a      Council at their away day in\u000a      2008, and considered at a roundtable seminar (June 2009) involving\u000a      Tribunal judges,\u000a      representatives and other stakeholders (organised by Professor Thomas as\u000a      part of the research\u000a      project) [2]. In 2010 an Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)\u000a      case, noted that the\u000a      country guidance system \"has recently been described by Robert Thomas\u000a      [C]... as his article\u000a        makes plain the development of the system has been encouraged by the\u000a        higher courts, who have\u000a        been concerned with the problem of inconsistent decisions in different\u000a        panels of the Asylum\u000a        Tribunal\" [3]. Also noting that the research had influenced the\u000a      Asylum Tribunal's country guidance\u000a      system, the judgement of Lord Justice Carnwath (then Senior President of\u000a      Tribunals, now Justice\u000a      of the Supreme Court) recommended that \"For an up-to-date review of\u000a        the development of the\u000a        system and of the modern practice it is unnecessary to do more than\u000a        refer to Robert Thomas'\u000a        comprehensive study: Administrative Justice and Asylum Appeals (2011)\u000a        chapter 7\" [4]; this\u000a      monograph was also been explicitly referenced in an official report, and\u000a      disseminated via a\u000a      national newspaper [5]. To this date, Professor Thomas' work continues to\u000a      be cited within asylum\u000a      appeal cases [6].\u000a    In addition to presentations and publications to practitioners, a\u000a      specially convened roundtable\u000a      seminar was organised by the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum\u000a      Chamber), which was\u000a      attended by judges from the High Court and the Court of Appeal as well as\u000a      tribunal judges and\u000a      other stakeholders. Professor Thomas gave an invited keynote speech, and\u000a      in that speech a\u000a      number of recommendations were presented, relating to how the country\u000a      guidance process could\u000a      be more effectively managed, in order to ameliorate concerns that had been\u000a      raised and to enhance\u000a      the country guidance process to enhance the tribunal system and access to\u000a      justice.\u000a    Direct impacts resulted from engagement with the Tribunal. In June\u000a      2011, It was suggested\u000a      that the Tribunal should produce more detailed guidance on the criteria\u000a      relating to the reporting of\u000a      Tribunal decisions and have an internal committee to keep the system under\u000a      review. The Tribunal\u000a      subsequently produced a detailed `Presidential Guidance Note' on the\u000a      reporting of its decisions [7].\u000a      The President of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)\u000a      commented that he was\u000a      \"grateful for the research... [It] was not confined to\u000a        publication [and] has indeed contributed to the\u000a        thinking of lead judges in this Chamber\". He continued by outlining\u000a      the specific areas of impact:\u000a    \"That seminar has led to judicial reflection on best practice, a new\u000a        Guidance Note on the\u000a        reporting of country guidance, an engagement with the Immigration Law\u000a        Practitioners'\u000a        Association on problems their members see arise, and an engagement with\u000a        the Home Office\u000a        Presenting Officers unit on management of country guidance cases. This\u000a        has proven to be\u000a        of considerable utility and has enabled us to case manage country\u000a        guidance cases with\u000a        more insight into common problems.\" [8]\u000a    The Upper Tribunal Judge with responsibility for the Tribunal's country\u000a      guidance work, has also\u000a      confirmed the value of Professor Thomas' work, noting that the Tribunal\u000a      now has \"an internal\u000a        Country Guidance Committee that keeps under review country guidance\u000a        issues and your book\u000a        continues to provide a helpful compass for us in deciding how to case\u000a        manage country guidance\u000a        cases better in the light of ongoing challenges\" [9].\u000a    The research has thus exerted direct and significant impact upon judicial\u000a      thinking and policy within\u000a      the Upper Tribunal, and in addition has studied the use of country of\u000a        origin information and\u000a        the operation of judicial remedies in asylum cases. As the\u000a      aforementioned Senior Immigration\u000a      Judge confirms, following the transfer of asylum `fresh claim' judicial\u000a      review cases to the Upper\u000a      Tribunal, and in developing the Tribunal's plans for handling this work:\"\u000a    \"... we are once again grateful for the background analysis that you\u000a        provide of UK remedies\u000a        in the asylum field.

The first project focused on family visitor appeals and showed\u000a      that the introduction of a fee\u000a      was not a significant deterrent to accessing the appeals process. The\u000a      second project on asylum\u000a      appeals made a number of recommendations concerning the handling of\u000a      appeals by the Tribunal,\u000a      and the reporting of its decisions.\u000a    The research on family visitor appeals was the basis for a Ministry of\u000a      Justice consultation paper in\u000a      2010, and was directly cited by the government when introducing fees for\u000a      immigration appeals.\u000a      The research on asylum appeals has influenced policy and thinking within\u000a      the Upper Tribunal\u000a      (Immigration and Asylum Chamber), with particular regard to the Tribunal's\u000a      management of its\u000a      country guidance system.

Both projects were empirical in\u000a      scope, and enjoyed\u000a      unprecedented access to the immigration appeals system, with Professor\u000a      Thomas seconded to the\u000a      Home Office in 2001.\u000a    Family visitor appeals research: This Home Office funded project\u000a      considered the use and\u000a      procedure of immigration appeals for individuals overseas wishing to visit\u000a      a family member in the\u000a      UK. It addressed the process by which individuals, refused a visa to visit\u000a      family members in the\u000a      UK, decide to appeal against such decisions to the Asylum and Immigration\u000a      Tribunal. More\u000a      specifically, it was assessed whether the introduction of an `appeal fee'\u000a      dissuaded people from\u000a      lodging an appeal, and the reasons for the higher success rate of oral\u000a      hearings over paper\u000a      appeals. This was the first published piece of empirical research into\u000a      immigration appeals, and was\u000a      commissioned in response to concerns that the appeal fee inhibited people\u000a      from activating the\u000a      appeals process.\u000a    The research found no clear evidence that the fee in itself was a\u000a        deterrent to making an\u000a        appeal, and whilst clear instances were identified where the level\u000a      of fee had deterred an applicant\u000a      from making an appeal, in many cases the applicant's sponsor played an\u000a      important role in the\u000a      decision to appeal. In 65% of the cases examined the sponsor paid for the\u000a      appeal, compared to\u000a      25% paid by the appellant. [D][E]\u000a    Asylum appeals research: This project examined the procedure and\u000a      determination of asylum\u000a      appeals by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (now the First-tier\u000a      and Upper Tribunal,\u000a      Immigration and Asylum Chamber). It was undertaken as a legal empirical\u000a      project funded by the\u000a      Nuffield Foundation (&#163;112,000), and ran from January 2007 to\u000a      December 2008. Alongside\u000a      Professor Thomas a research associate (Rute Caldeira) was employed for the\u000a      duration of the\u000a      project. The empirical element of the research involved: observatory fieldwork\u000a      at four tribunal\u000a      hearing centres (in particular asylum appeal hearings); the analysis\u000a      of tribunal determinations; and\u000a      a range of in-depth interviews with tribunal judges,\u000a      representatives, Home Office presenting\u000a      officers, country experts and medical professionals.\u000a    The research involved an in-depth assessment of the Tribunal's country\u000a      guidance system, by\u000a      which it assesses the degree of risk posed by conditions in countries from\u000a      which asylum claimants\u000a      originate. The research recognised that this provided an innovative tool\u000a      for managing the wider\u000a      adjudication process to promote consistent decision-making, and had much\u000a      to commend it.\u000a      However, it was also noted that the Tribunal could usefully refine the\u000a      country guidance system to\u000a      case manage appeals more effectively, thus enhancing its overall\u000a      effectiveness. The research\u000a      utilised fieldwork data to consider both the pros and cons of the country\u000a      guidance system, as well\u000a      as its practical operation.\u000a    The research recognised that the determination of asylum appeals is\u000a        inherently difficult &#8212;\u000a      not just in terms of making an individual decision, but also regarding the\u000a      management of a broader\u000a      adjudication process &#8212; given that there are 25,000 appeals each year and\u000a      some 600 Immigration\u000a      Judges. A number of recommendations were made, based upon the need\u000a      to `produce good quality\u000a      decisions through fair procedures', whilst ensuring that the appeals\u000a      process is as swift as possible.\u000a      This included a consideration of best practice around the effective\u000a      preparation of appeals, and the\u000a      suggestion of criteria governing the reporting of decisions. [A][B][C]\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30006","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Good Practice Guidance we have produced is the first and only\u000a      official guidance on psychiatric reports for sentencing in England and\u000a      Wales endorsed by HMCS. The authority of the Guidance is increased by the\u000a      fact that the research received the support of a steering group of senior\u000a      staff from the MoJ, HMCS, the Department of Health, a senior judge from\u000a      the Central Criminal Court, a district judge heading an MoJ pilot project\u000a      mental health court and the Chair of the Faculty of Forensic Psychiatry of\u000a      the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Reports may be commissioned by the\u000a      magistrates' courts and the Crown Court when a defendant is considered\u000a      possibly to have a mental disorder and an expert medical opinion is\u000a      necessary to assist sentencing. The Bradley Report (April 2009) indicates\u000a      that the estimated number of mentally disordered suspects passing through\u000a      police stations in England and Wales varies between 2% and 20%.\u000a    In 2010 the Mental Health Policy Lead for HMCS (A) supervised an\u000a      extensive programme of dissemination of the Guidance. This involved the\u000a      publication of the Guidance in the web site of the MoJ and the posting of\u000a      a notice on the intranet system for magistrates and Crown Court's judges.\u000a      In addition the Guidance was incorporated into the manuals for magistrates\u000a      and Crown Court's judges containing operational guidance in relation to\u000a      the court work. During the first few months (especially the first three\u000a      months) after the publication of the Guidance, the Mental Health Policy\u000a      Lead office was contacted by a number of forensic psychiatrists and\u000a      members of the judiciary (between 20 and 40 people) feeding back on the\u000a      usefulness of the Guidance in overcoming the previous lack of\u000a      consistency\/relevance of psychiatric reports for sentencing, and\/or asking\u000a      for advice and explanation in relation to the use of the Guidance. In\u000a      particular a number of inquiries from the courts concerned some aspects of\u000a      the commissioning process (including how to identify\/access suitable local\u000a      forensic psychiatrists and what skills are required for the production of\u000a      relevant\/high quality psychiatric reports for sentencing). Courts must\u000a      ensure that the Guidance is complied with, as failure to do so may lead to\u000a      objections raised by defence solicitors or the judiciary.\u000a    In 2010 the Guidance was endorsed also by the Faculty of Forensic\u000a      Psychiatry of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which contributed to its\u000a      dissemination among practitioners by making it available at various levels\u000a      to Divisions and Faculties across the UK and on the Forensic Faculty\u000a      website. According to the former Chair of the Faculty (in office until\u000a      July 2012) and current Clinical Director of Forensic Services at Oxleas\u000a      NHS Foundation Trust (South London)(B), the implementation of the\u000a      Guidance produced impact especially in relation to the relationship\u000a      between forensic psychiatrists and local courts. One example is that in\u000a      2012 in South London a single point of access to psychiatric services was\u000a      created, as advised by the Guidance. This is a single point of access\u000a      system allowing the commissioners to request a report from local health\u000a      providers by directing their request to the Bracton Centre (forensic\u000a      service) which will deal with the request and source a suitable\u000a      psychiatrist for the report. This Service Level Agreement has ensured\u000a      timely supply of psychiatric reports of consistent quality to the\u000a      magistrates' courts.\u000a    Another area of impact of the Guidance concerns the training of trainee\u000a      forensic psychiatrists and their communication with non-psychiatrists in\u000a      the commissioning of reports. B informed us that since 2010 the Guidance\u000a      has been used in training forensic psychiatrists by Educational\u000a      Supervisors and in Court Liaison Teams operational throughout South\u000a      London. The adoption of the Guidance for training has also been confirmed\u000a      by the Medical Director and consultant forensic psychiatrist at the South\u000a      Staffordshire and Shropshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (C).\u000a      She teaches the principles of the Guidance to core trainees and higher\u000a      trainees in forensic psychiatry and noted that the Guidance will enable\u000a      two significant improvements in the production of relevant psychiatric\u000a      reports, properly addressing the questions raised by the commissioner of\u000a      the report. Firstly, prior to the guidance, such reports lacked focus or\u000a      were `all purpose' reports not responding to the specific needs of the\u000a      commissioner. Secondly, psychiatric reports used to be written in a\u000a      specialist clinical language not accessible to a non-psychiatrist. By\u000a      learning the principles laid down in the Guidance, trainee forensic\u000a      psychiatrists are developing skills in the production of relevant,\u000a      well-written reports that more effectively address the needs of the\u000a      commissioner. C also cited improvements in interaction with the\u000a      commissioners as a result of the Guidance. Previously there was little\u000a      specific instruction on how to commission and produce a psychiatric\u000a      report. Accordingly there was a lack of consistency in the practice across\u000a      the sector and so commissioners occasionally questioned aspects of the\u000a      reports and required supplementary reports where they felt that issues had\u000a      not been satisfactorily addressed. She notes that the existence of the\u000a      official Guidance provides a solid source for practitioners' reference,\u000a      both for commissioners and consultant forensic psychiatrists. In this way\u000a      commissioners are clearer about what can be expected of a psychiatric\u000a      report and how a report should appear in terms of structure, language and\u000a      content, and consultant forensic psychiatrists can direct commissioners to\u000a      this Guidance for reference.\u000a    Impact on training and practice has been further confirmed by a\u000a      consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Ashworth Hospital (D) (one\u000a      of the 3 high secure psychiatric hospitals in England and Wales). While\u000a      doing research for his master's thesis at the University of Manchester\u000a      (2012), D learned about the Guidance, which became part of his\u000a      professional background. D learned about the Guidance also during an\u000a      expert witness training course at UCLAN (2012). Whilst the Royal College\u000a      of Psychiatrists' 2008 Report aims to achieve similar aims as the MoJ 2010\u000a      Good Practice Guidance, D finds that the latter is more detailed and\u000a      better fit for purpose. D informed us that he wrote 10 psychiatric reports\u000a      in 2012 and 5 in 2013, in all cases abiding by the Guidance and putting in\u000a      practice its recommendations. D brought to our attention that the Guidance\u000a      impacted on his practice beyond psychiatric reports for sentencing. When\u000a      writing psychiatric reports for admission to high secure care D follows\u000a      the recommendations of the Guidance as they are transferable to this other\u000a      field of activity.\u000a    We have recently been informed by the Head of Consultancy Service (E)\u000a      at St Andrew's Healthcare (the largest UK mental health charity) that\u000a      during 2013 the Service distributed the Guidance to over 70 clinicians\u000a      working within the Consultancy Service (including consultant forensic\u000a      psychiatrists) for information when they act as expert witnesses for the\u000a      courts through the Service.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The underpinning research led to the production of good practice guidance\u000a      for psychiatric reports for sentencing to be used by courts and forensic\u000a      psychiatrists, when commissioning and producing such reports. It is the\u000a      first and only official guidance on psychiatric reports for sentencing in\u000a      England and Wales endorsed by HMCS. In 2010 it was implemented by HMCS in\u000a      magistrates' courts and in the Crown Court in England and Wales. In the\u000a      same year it received the endorsement of the Faculty of Forensic\u000a      Psychiatry of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. The guidance has\u000a      improved the language, structure and content of psychiatric reports for\u000a      sentencing and it has enhanced the training of forensic psychiatrists.

Those who had been involved in the first and second\u000a      stages of the research were invited to participate in the third phase of\u000a      the work, in which the guidance was tested in practice. The aims of this\u000a      final stage were: to test the guidance among professionals who would use\u000a      it on the ground; to gain feedback on the relevance and usefulness of the\u000a      guidance; and to identify any necessary amendments or changes to the\u000a      guidance. The developed document was circulated by e-mail among a panel of\u000a      42 participants who had consented to re-contact. In addition, several\u000a      participants' colleagues requested participation at this stage and were\u000a      included in the e-mail circulation. It was generally felt that the\u000a      guidance reflected their input into its production, to be relevant, and to\u000a      be likely to lead to significant improvements in the quality, timeliness\u000a      and uniformity of reports.\u000a    The guidance is divided into three main sections: guidance on the\u000a      commissioning process; guidance on administration of reports (including a\u000a      pro forma for letters of instruction to ensure sentencers' requests for\u000a      reports gave a clear steer to the psychiatrist); and guidance on\u000a      production of reports (including a report template to ensure an\u000a      appropriate structure is followed).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30013","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In terms of primary impact, the research findings directly led to the\u000a      development of Liverpool City Council's media campaign (detailed below)\u000a      which aimed at raising awareness around alcohol involved sexual assault.\u000a      Moreover, the research was also the primary driver in both the decision to\u000a      focus the messages on potential male perpetrators and educating young men,\u000a      as opposed to potential victims. Due to existing contacts between the\u000a      Council and LJMU Centre for Public Health (Dr Karen Hughes), in July 2011\u000a      Dr Gunby was invited to present a paper on the underpinning research to\u000a      the Liverpool Student Safety Group (comprised of Student Union\u000a      representatives from Liverpool John Moores, Liverpool Hope and Liverpool\u000a      University, along with representatives from the police, Liverpool\u000a      Licensing, Sexual Assault Referral Centres, Domestic Violence Team, Fire\u000a      Service and Liverpool City Council). Following the presentation, Dr Gunby\u000a      was invited in August 2011 to work with Liverpool City Council to develop\u000a      a campaign. Clare met twice with Citysafe and corresponded via email\u000a      throughout the development phase (August-December 2011). The campaign ran\u000a      in Liverpool city centre from January to March 2012, and was co-funded by\u000a      the Liverpool City Council Community Safety and Cohesion Team and the\u000a      Liverpool Primary Care Trust. Other stakeholders involved in the\u000a      consultation process included the City Council's Youth Services team, the\u000a      BRM Domestic Violence Group, lead officers from SAFE Place Merseyside\u000a      (Sexual Assault Referral Centre) and RASA Centre (Rape and Sexual\u000a      Assault). The key aims of the campaign were:\u000a    - To clarify that in England and Wales engaging in sexual activity with\u000a      someone unable to consent, due to voluntary or involuntary intoxication,\u000a      is rape,\u000a    - To reduce and prevent the offences of rape and sexual assault, and\u000a    - To raise awareness of the impact of non consensual sex against young\u000a      women and girls using the night time economy (Nowak 2012: 2).\u000a    The campaign was aimed at men aged between 18-24, specifically students\u000a      and night time economy users, and involved the distribution of posters,\u000a      beer mats and mirror stickers, which depicted a drunk woman along with the\u000a      phrase `can't talk, can't consent' and the message `sex without consent is\u000a      rape'. These were distributed across Liverpool &#8212; in the Students' Unions,\u000a      around the Liverpool Universities campuses, and in City Centre pubs and\u000a      bars.\u000a    The campaign was also supported by information posted on various\u000a      websites, including Student Safety, Citysafe, PCT, Merseyside Fire and\u000a      Rescue\/Merseyside Police, a facebook advert and a webpage link, in\u000a      addition to adverts in newspapers and on the radio. Accordingly, the\u000a      messages promoted in the posters were supported by a range of\u000a      communication channels. Analysis has indicated that the campaign was\u000a      effective in reaching a significant audience. The facebook page generated\u000a      6,506 clicks from over 27 million impressions. Nowak has commented that\u000a      `as a passive form of advertising, the number of clicks is very\u000a      encouraging for the campaign, whilst the exposure gained from the activity\u000a      will have had a significant impact on the campaign's awareness' (2012: 5).\u000a      The campaign materials also included a link to the Citysafe Community\u000a      Safety Webpage which contained details to services providing support to\u000a      those who have been victims of sexual violence. Over the campaign period\u000a      4,670 unique views were generated to this page (including another 190 in\u000a      the month post campaign). A number of positive `tweets' citing the advert\u000a      were also identified on twitter, commenting in particular on how it was\u000a      important that the campaign was aimed at men, as opposed to women as\u000a      potential victims.\u000a    In terms of secondary impact, quantitative and qualitative evaluation\u000a      demonstrates that the campaign was effective in educating and raising the\u000a      awareness of young men. A street based survey, organised by Liverpool City\u000a      Council, found that from a sample of 275 males, 92% agreed that the\u000a      campaign raised an important issue, 73% agreed that the images and\u000a      information made men think about their behaviour and 78% agreed that the\u000a      campaign made it clear that if someone is so drunk they are unable to\u000a      meaningfully respond, then having sex with them would be a criminal\u000a      offence (Nowak, 2012: 17). Findings from six focus groups with a total of\u000a      41 male students, organised by Dr Carline and Dr Gunby, also support the\u000a      finding that the campaign effectively conveyed the message that having sex\u000a      with someone who is exceptionally intoxicated amounts to rape. Respondents\u000a      also thought it was positive that the campaign informed the public that\u000a      the majority of sexual assaults are committed by someone known to the\u000a      victim and in a domestic setting.\u000a    Accordingly, it can be seen that the research had a direct impact on the\u000a      Liverpool City Council, the NUS and the student population. This is\u000a      because the findings informed the Council's decision to develop a media\u000a      campaign that was intended to focus on potential perpetrators, as opposed\u000a      to victims. The impact upon the NUS occurs due to their involvement in the\u000a      campaign, in particular the placement of posters around campus, and in\u000a      turn this impacts upon the student population as they are the recipients\u000a      of the campaign message.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The findings of this research project directly led to the formation of a\u000a      Liverpool city wide campaign which ran in 2012. The findings highlighted\u000a      the prevalence of alcohol related sexual assault amongst the student\u000a      population in the Merseyside region, along with misunderstandings\u000a      regarding the relevant legal provisions and the presence of victim blaming\u000a      attitudes amongst the lay population. Following consultation with Dr Gunby\u000a      (formerly LJMU), the Council decided to develop a campaign focused on\u000a      raising awareness and educating young men (aged 18-24) on the issue of\u000a      intoxication, consent and the law of rape. This is a much called for and\u000a      significant change, as rape campaigns have almost exclusively focused on\u000a      the behaviour of young women, which tends to problematically reinforce\u000a      rape myths. To this end, Dr Gunby worked closely with Liverpool Citysafe\u000a      Crime Reduction Partnership on the compilation of the campaign. The main\u000a      beneficiaries of this research are Liverpool City Council, the National\u000a      Union of Students (NUS) and the student population within Merseyside.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Liverpool John Moores University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Liverpool John Moores University","InstitutionName":"Liverpool John Moores University","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10003957}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a&#8226; Gunby Clare, Carline Anna and Beynon Caryl (2012) Regretting It\u000a      After?

Research also indicates that this association\u000a      between alcohol and sexual outcomes inevitably serves to influence\u000a      judgments around the consensual nature of alcohol involved intercourse.\u000a      There is also a well established association between alcohol and sexual\u000a      offences, with England's Alcohol Harm Reduction strategy in 2004\u000a      highlighting that there are approximately 19,000 alcohol related assaults\u000a      each year. Research also shows that in 56% of reported rape cases the\u000a      complainant had consumed alcohol. However, whilst the association between\u000a      consuming alcohol and experiencing non-consensual sex is now largely\u000a      established, especially amongst student populations, little research had\u000a      previously addressed English students' experiences of non-consensual sex\u000a      when intoxicated. Or the alcohol related strategies used to procure\u000a      intercourse (e.g. targeting extremely drunk women), with most research\u000a      involving American students. Furthermore, major changes to the law of rape\u000a      occurred in 2003 and little research had been conducted examining the\u000a      impacts of these reforms on rape and sexual assault cases.\u000a    Given the paucity of research in England and Wales, the aim of the\u000a      research was to explore the experiences of, and perspectives towards,\u000a      alcohol intoxication and non-consensual sexual activity amongst students.\u000a      The research also generated original knowledge from legal practitioners\u000a      regarding the law's treatment of intoxicated rape complainants. The\u000a      research involved an interdisciplinary project undertaken by Dr Anna\u000a      Carline (Senior Lecturer in Law), Dr Caryl Beynon (Reader in Epidemiology)\u000a      and Dr Clare Gunby (Lecturer, January 2012 to June 2013). The research\u000a      encompassed three studies: an online survey of university students aged\u000a      18-24 to ascertain their experiences of, and understandings around,\u000a      alcohol involved non-consensual sex and the law of rape; semi-structured\u000a      interviews with barristers who prosecuted and defended rape cases; and\u000a      focus groups with students to examine attitudes and understandings in\u000a      relation to alcohol consumption and non-consensual sex. Findings indicated\u000a      that 33 per cent of women and 21 per cent of male students sampled had\u000a      experienced some form of alcohol involved non- consensual sexual activity\u000a      (although women experienced more \"serious\" levels of assault involving\u000a      penetration) and women were frequently targeted when they were too drunk\u000a      to consent to intercourse. The research also identified that women were\u000a      more likely to be blamed by lay persons for being assaulted if they were\u000a      drunk at the time, compared to women who had not been drinking alcohol. A\u000a      drinking double standard was also identified: whilst women were blamed\u000a      more for their assault as their level of intoxication increased, increased\u000a      intoxication in men resulted in a reduction of their responsibility for\u000a      perpetrating a sexual offence. In addition, the findings highlighted a\u000a      lack of understanding and confusion amongst students regarding the law of\u000a      rape and the meaning of consent, particularly in cases involving\u000a      intoxication. Barristers also identified that alcohol consumption\u000a      disproportionately impacted on the credibility of the victim at trial,\u000a      rather than the culpability of the defendant, despite significant changes\u000a      in the law which attempted to focus more on the behaviour of alleged\u000a      perpetrators.\u000a    The research recommended that future messages must emphasise the\u000a      responsibility placed on alleged perpetrators of assault to take proactive\u000a      steps in ensuring consent and highlight that sex with a person who is too\u000a      intoxicated to consent is rape. Rape campaign materials frequently and\u000a      problematically focus on altering the behaviour of young women, by\u000a      educating them on how to avoid being assaulted, as opposed to challenging\u000a      the actions of potential perpetrators, and also educating the public on\u000a      the law of rape. Messages which have been echoed in the Stern Review\u000a      (2010) and the Government's Action Plan to end violence against women and\u000a      girls (2012).

Here again, his\u000d\u000a      monograph prompted an\u000d\u000a      invitation from UNCITRAL to become a member of an expert-group. He\u000d\u000a      assisted UNCITRAL during\u000d\u000a      the first drafting process of procedural rules suitable for resolving\u000d\u000a      low-value cross-border disputes\u000d\u000a      arising from e-commerce.

Conflicts arising from a typical purchase on eBay (e.g. a\u000d\u000a      photographic camera that never\u000d\u000a      arrives or that is damaged) are almost never resolved in the courts\u000d\u000a      because the cost of bringing\u000d\u000a      such claims would outweigh the value of the dispute, especially so when\u000d\u000a      the parties are located in\u000d\u000a      different jurisdictions. Therefore, the use of traditional litigation for\u000d\u000a      disputes arising in this forum is\u000d\u000a      often impractical, time-consuming and expensive, particularly for settling\u000d\u000a      low-value cross-border\u000d\u000a      disputes.\u000d\u000a    Cort&#233;s (lecturer at Leicester from 2008 and senior lecturer from 2012)\u000d\u000a      researches the effectiveness\u000d\u000a      of informal, out-of-court dispute resolution, commonly known as\u000d\u000a      Alternative Dispute Resolution\u000d\u000a      (ADR), when complemented with Information and Communications Technology\u000d\u000a      tools. More\u000d\u000a      specifically his research (3.1-3.5) shows how the law could\u000d\u000a      guarantee standards of due process in\u000d\u000a      Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) methods (such as arbitration, mediation,\u000d\u000a      negotiation and\u000d\u000a      ombudsman schemes accessible online) and proposes the development of\u000d\u000a      incentives to promote\u000d\u000a      ODR systems that can instill trust in consumers' online transactions.\u000d\u000a    Cort&#233;s has provided (3.1) an in-depth account of the potential of\u000d\u000a      ODR for European consumers,\u000d\u000a      offering a comprehensive and up to date analysis of the development of\u000d\u000a      ODR. The monograph's\u000d\u000a      unique contribution was the discussion on best practices for ODR providers\u000d\u000a      that resolve consumer-to-business\u000d\u000a      disputes arising from e-commerce. It recommended the drafting of a\u000d\u000a      European\u000d\u000a      Regulation and included a blue-print with the legal standards that ODR\u000d\u000a      providers should have in\u000d\u000a      order to become accredited by public authorities. It argued that the\u000d\u000a      accreditation and monitoring of\u000d\u000a      ODR mechanisms are necessary to close the gap between the potential of ODR\u000d\u000a      services and their\u000d\u000a      actual use. Accordingly, the book concluded that if ODR systems were to\u000d\u000a      realise their full potential\u000d\u000a      in the resolution of e-commerce disputes and in the enforcement of\u000d\u000a      consumer rights, they must be\u000d\u000a      grounded firmly on a European regulatory model. His monograph has informed\u000d\u000a      the European\u000d\u000a      Commission and the UN Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL),\u000d\u000a      which realised that\u000d\u000a      an effective framework for online redress would in turn enhance the\u000d\u000a      competitiveness of online\u000d\u000a      trade. Similar conclusions have been reached by eBay-PayPal which, acting\u000d\u000a      as a neutral third\u000d\u000a      party, resolves over 60 million disputes a year between buyers and\u000d\u000a      sellers. Empirical research by\u000d\u000a      eBay has demonstrated that buyers who resolved their disputes in a short\u000d\u000a      period of time\u000d\u000a      subsequently enter into more transactions than those who have not had any\u000d\u000a      disputes during the\u000d\u000a      same time period. This research also found that sellers prefer to lose a\u000d\u000a      case quickly than to spend\u000d\u000a      weeks on a dispute that they eventually win.\u000d\u000a    Cort&#233;s' research also expanded outside the regional approach, examining\u000d\u000a      ODR systems that\u000d\u000a      operate internationally, where one of the parties lives outside the EU.\u000d\u000a      More specifically he has\u000d\u000a      conducted research on how to instil consumer protection measures that are\u000d\u000a      compatible with the\u000d\u000a      EU approach to consumer protection (3.2). Cort&#233;s has acted as an\u000d\u000a      expert for the UN (UNCITRAL\u000d\u000a      Working Group III) during the drafting of ODR rules, the goal of which is\u000d\u000a      to address effectively\u000d\u000a      cross-border disputes of low-value that arise from e-commerce (3.2).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31742","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Bell's research has influenced anti-discrimination law and policy in the\u000d\u000a      EU and contributed to the agendas of European NGOs working on\u000d\u000a      anti-discrimination. Changes in this area of law and policy have the\u000d\u000a      potential to reach individuals and businesses throughout the EU, but also\u000d\u000a      beyond.

The Network was created by\u000d\u000a      the Commission to be an independent source of research and data on how\u000d\u000a      national governments transpose EU anti-discrimination law. The work of the\u000d\u000a      Network is used by the Commission to inform its decisions on when to\u000d\u000a      initiate infringement proceedings against a state for non-compliance. In\u000d\u000a      practical terms, the Network produced a detailed annual report on each\u000d\u000a      Member State of the EU, as well as those countries recognised as\u000d\u000a      candidates for EU accession. Bell contributed specialist analysis of the\u000d\u000a      implementation of the prohibition of sexual orientation discrimination in\u000d\u000a      these countries, through making detailed comments on each annual national\u000d\u000a      report as well as co-authoring three editions of a comparative analysis\u000d\u000a      report, which provided an overview of the situation in the EU. During this\u000d\u000a      period, the Commission pursued a range of Member States from across the EU\u000d\u000a      for shortcomings in national anti-discrimination legislation. This led to\u000d\u000a      a steady enhancement in the quality of national legislation as states took\u000d\u000a      steps to comply with the EU Directives. The significance of this lies in\u000d\u000a      improved legal protection for individuals who are at risk of experiencing\u000d\u000a      discrimination.\u000d\u000a    In 2008, he led a half-day policy review meeting with the `Action against\u000d\u000a      Discrimination, Civil Society' Policy Unit within DG Employment, Social\u000d\u000a      Affairs and Equal Opportunities. This fed into preparation of a new set of\u000d\u000a      policy proposals published in July 2008. The Head of Unit in the European\u000d\u000a      Commission wrote to Bell on 10 July 2008 stating: `our initial\u000d\u000a        discussion with you was very inspiring and we continued to come back to\u000d\u000a        that in our internal discussions on the successive drafts of the\u000d\u000a        text' (5.1). On 2 July 2008, the Commission also published a\u000d\u000a      proposal for a new anti-discrimination Directive; the explanatory document\u000d\u000a      (5.2) cited a report co-authored by Bell (Developing\u000d\u000a      Anti-Discrimination Law in Europe). This report was also cited in a\u000d\u000a      European Parliament resolution in 2008 (5.3).\u000d\u000a    In addition, Bell was regularly invited to speak at conferences of EU\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and legal practitioners on the implementation of EU\u000d\u000a      anti-discrimination law. For example, this included the 2008 `Equality\u000d\u000a      Summit' (part of the French Presidency of the EU) and a 2009 European\u000d\u000a      Commission-funded conference in Brussels on comparative analysis of\u000d\u000a      national law and policy on positive action.\u000d\u000a    Influencing NGO strategy on the Proposed Directive\u000d\u000a    In anticipation of this proposed Directive, in 2008 Bell was invited to\u000d\u000a      chair an expert group on anti-discrimination law for the European Network\u000d\u000a      Against Racism (ENAR). ENAR is an EU-wide network of NGOs from EU Member\u000d\u000a      States. It combats racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related\u000d\u000a      intolerance. ENAR's expert group was composed of 24 members, mainly from\u000d\u000a      European and national level NGOs dealing with discrimination on a range of\u000d\u000a      grounds and representing 9 different countries, but also including some\u000d\u000a      academics. Bell (the only academic participating from the UK) wrote the\u000d\u000a      report of the expert group (5.4), which recommended that any\u000d\u000a      forthcoming Directive should cover a range of discrimination grounds\u000d\u000a      (religion, disability, age, sexual orientation) within one instrument\u000d\u000a      rather than separate Directives for each form of discrimination. Although\u000d\u000a      the European Commission had initially intended to propose a Directive\u000d\u000a      limited to disability discrimination, it changed its approach and the\u000d\u000a      final proposal covered several grounds of discrimination (in line with the\u000d\u000a      recommendations of the expert group).\u000d\u000a    After the proposed Directive was issued, Bell was consulted regularly by\u000d\u000a      several Brussels-based European NGOs on their strategy in seeking\u000d\u000a      amendments to the draft Directive. In particular, he provided advice to\u000d\u000a      ILGA-Europe. ILGA-Europe is a non-governmental organisation bringing\u000d\u000a      together 408 organisations from 45 European countries. It advocates for\u000d\u000a      equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people. Even\u000d\u000a      before the Commission had published its proposed Directive, Bell had\u000d\u000a      already drafted an alternative text for ILGA-Europe. He assisted\u000d\u000a      ILGA-Europe in comparing its text with that of the Commission and spoke at\u000d\u000a      a hearing in the European Parliament arguing for a revision of the\u000d\u000a      provisions of the Directive relating to benefits for unmarried partners\u000d\u000a      (10 December 2008). Some of the amendments recommended by ILGA-Europe were\u000d\u000a      subsequently addressed in the European Parliament's amendments (5.5)\u000a      to the proposed Directive (e.g. on the exception for marital benefits or\u000d\u000a      clearer protection from multiple discrimination).\u000d\u000a    In 2009, Bell was also invited to join a virtual network of 9 European\u000d\u000a      legal experts consulted by the `Social Platform', an umbrella network of\u000d\u000a      European NGOs concerned with EU social policy. The Social Platform\u000d\u000a      includes organisations such as the European Anti-Poverty Network, the\u000d\u000a      European Disability Forum, or the European Women's Lobby. As a member of\u000d\u000a      the virtual network, Bell provided advice and information to the Social\u000d\u000a      Platform regarding its approach to advocating amendments to the proposed\u000d\u000a      Directive.\u000d\u000a    Influencing Courts on Anti-Discrimination Law\u000d\u000a    A book that Bell co-edited in 2007 (3.1), was cited in an opinion\u000d\u000a      of Advocate-General Maduro of the European Court of Justice (5.6)\u000d\u000a      and in a judgment of the House of Lords (5.7).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Discrimination remains a common social problem within and beyond the EU;\u000d\u000a      e.g. the Fundamental Rights Agency found that in some EU states more than\u000d\u000a      one-third of ethnic minorities reported experiencing discrimination when\u000d\u000a      looking for work in the previous 12 months. Research by Professor Mark\u000d\u000a      Bell has helped to influence EU law and policy on combating\u000d\u000a      discrimination, as well as contributing to the agendas of European\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisations in this field. Specifically, his research\u000d\u000a      was used in formulating proposals for a new anti-discrimination Directive.\u000d\u000a      He advised several NGOs on their strategy for seeking amendments to\u000d\u000a      enhance the draft Directive.

Increasingly, law has been used as a method of combating\u000d\u000a      discrimination. Within the EU, anti-discrimination law initially focused\u000d\u000a      on gender equality.\u000d\u000a    Bell's (Leicester 1999-present, initially lecturer, now professor)\u000d\u000a      research has explored the transformation of EU anti-discrimination law\u000d\u000a      during the period since 1999. The law has shifted from its traditional\u000d\u000a      focus on gender and expanded to address other forms of discrimination,\u000d\u000a      such as those based on ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, age\u000d\u000a      and disability. This was crystallised by the adoption in 2000 of two EU\u000d\u000a      Directives dealing with these `new' forms of discrimination.\u000d\u000a    Bell's research in the period since 2000 has concentrated on analysing\u000d\u000a      the content of these Directives (3.4; 3.5), the reasons for\u000d\u000a      this shift in the direction of EU law (3.6), and comparative\u000d\u000a      analysis of the process of implementing the Directives in the Member\u000d\u000a      States (3.1; 3.2). This has been with a view to\u000d\u000a      understanding better what might make anti-discrimination law effective in\u000d\u000a      practice. Bell's research concluded that the Directives relied too heavily\u000d\u000a      on a strategy of enforcement via individual litigation (3.3). Given\u000d\u000a      that individuals face a range of barriers that deter litigation, such as\u000d\u000a      lack of information or the financial and emotional costs of legal\u000d\u000a      proceedings, it was unlikely that this would be an adequate means of\u000d\u000a      promoting equality. In particular, his later research contended that\u000d\u000a      tackling institutionalised forms of discrimination required public\u000d\u000a      institutions to be placed under legal duties to promote equality. This\u000d\u000a      culminated in his 2008 monograph (3.3), which provides a critical\u000d\u000a      evaluation of the EU's efforts to `mainstream' the promotion of ethnic\u000d\u000a      equality throughout law and policy. He found that improved institutional\u000d\u000a      structures were needed if these initiatives were to be effective.\u000d\u000a    His research has also explored the need to complement the existing\u000d\u000a      anti-discrimination Directives with further EU legislation in order to\u000d\u000a      fill some of the gaps in the current legal framework (3.4; 3.6).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31859","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research that led to this impact has been a continuing project over a\u000a      number of years, and arose out of an absence of critical analysis of the\u000a      lack of control of powers of entry to private premises available to\u000a      officials other than the police. As noted above, the published work is the\u000a      principal reference point for both academics and practitioners in relation\u000a      to this issue.\u000a    As revealed by the research, the number of non-police entry powers is\u000a      extensive.

He had discovered the 2005\u000a      edition of Professor Stone's book as being the only source that provided\u000a      information about these powers. He had also found that many government\u000a      departments where unable to list the powers which they had, until directed\u000a      towards the relevant section of Professor Stone's book.\u000a    Professor Stone was then involved in the drafting of the private member's\u000a      Bill, and its associated schedule of powers. Professor Stone also drafted\u000a      the Code of Practice which was attached as a schedule to the Bill. The aim\u000a      was to produce some standardisation into the ways in which such powers\u000a      were used, and to ensure that those subject to them were given proper\u000a      information about them &#8212; wherever possible before their exercise. These\u000a      changes would have the effect of addressing some of the problems\u000a      identified in the research as regards inconsistency and lack of clarity in\u000a      the scope of such powers. The Bill was introduced in the House of Lords in\u000a      the 2007-08 session, and completed all stages there in July 2008, but at\u000a      that stage it lacked government support, and was not debated in the\u000a      Commons.\u000a    The Home Office then (i.e. summer 2008) expressed interest in this\u000a      possible reform, and Professor Stone was involved with discussions with\u000a      Lord Selsdon and Home Office officials. Although still lacking government\u000a      support, Lord Selsdon reintroduced his Bill in the 2009-10 session, when\u000a      it again completed all stages in the House of Lords (concluding with its\u000a      Third Reading in April 2010).\u000a    Following the general election, later in 2010 the Coalition Government\u000a      indicated to Lord Selsdon that it intended to take over this matter, and a\u000a      reform along similar lines to the proposals contained in Lord Selsdon's\u000a      Bill and the Code of Practice was included in the Protection of Freedoms\u000a      Bill 2011. This became the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.\u000a    The result of the new legislation is a much clearer statutory framework\u000a      of law governing the powers of entry of officials other than the police.\u000a      The Act provides for a comprehensive two-year review, carried out within\u000a      each government department, of the need for existing powers (which is\u000a      currently ongoing), and a `gateway' procedure, which is intended to make\u000a      it harder to create new powers without establishing the necessity for\u000a      them. Where such powers do continue to exist, they will be exercisable\u000a      subject to a Code of Practice, which is currently in a draft form.\u000a      Professor Stone has provided his expert comments on this draft to the Home\u000a      Office, and expects to continue to be engaged with the implementation of\u000a      the law. This work is ongoing.\u000a    As will be seen from the list of agencies exercising powers of this type\u000a      given above, the impact of this reform and the underpinning research will\u000a      be widespread, and will affect virtually all government departments, many\u000a      aspects of local government work, and all companies involved in the\u000a      provision of public utilities.\u000a    All of the many thousands of officials who use such powers will become\u000a      subject to statutory provisions and a code of practice, which will\u000a      regulate their use. This should result in improvement in their operation,\u000a      not least from the point of view of the citizen who is subject to them.

Research carried out by Professor Stone from 2003\u000a      culminated in the publication of an updated, and significantly revised,\u000a      edition of Professor Stone's book, The Law of Entry, Search and Seizure\u000a      (4th edition, Oxford University Press, 2005). Research in this area has\u000a      continued, leading to a 5th edition of the text, published in the spring\u000a      of 2013. Professor Stone is the only UK academic currently focussing on\u000a      this specific area, and his work is regularly cited in both academic and\u000a      practitioners' texts relating to discussion of powers of entry.\u000a    The particular aspect of the research which is of greatest importance in\u000a      relation to this case study arose out of a lack of easily available\u000a      information about, and control over, the powers of entry to private\u000a      premises available to officials other than the police. Most central and\u000a      local government departments have such powers, as do officials from\u000a      companies running national utilities (electricity, gas, water). There was,\u000a      however, a lack of awareness of the existence of such powers amongst the\u000a      public, and no easy way of discovering their existence or scope.\u000a    In addition, in contrast to powers exercised by the police, there was no\u000a      code of practice governing their use. There was also a shortage of\u000a      critical analysis of such powers. The research therefore aimed to identify\u000a      and analyse these powers, and thus to provide a comprehensive survey of\u000a      them. In particular, work for the 2005 edition sought to place the area\u000a      and issues in their human rights context, following the coming into force\u000a      of the Human Rights Act 1998 in October 2000. This was important, in that\u000a      all public officials would now have to exercise the powers in a way that\u000a      was compatible with the rights contained in the European Convention on\u000a      Human Rights, and listed in the schedule to the Human Rights Act.\u000a    The research, which took place between 2003 and 2005, therefore involved\u000a      a systematic examination of all statutes and statutory instruments passed\u000a      since 1997, and identification of all powers giving a right of entry to\u000a      private premises (which are not always clearly signposted in the\u000a      legislation). All previously existing powers also needed to be checked for\u000a      repeal or amendment, using a combination of legal databases (e.g. Westlaw,\u000a      Lexis) and the provisions of subsequent legislation. Once identified, the\u000a      powers were classified and analysed according to their subject areas (e.g.\u000a      education, environmental health), or the officials who were using them\u000a      (e.g. Revenue and Customs, trading standards officers).\u000a    The analysis needed to take particular account of the impact of the Human\u000a      Rights Act, since all such powers will potentially involve a breach of\u000a      Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and will need to be\u000a      both necessary and proportionate to the objective which they are intended\u000a      to achieve, both in content and use. It also needed to consider issues of\u000a      consistency between powers (e.g. as regards the need for a warrant, or the\u000a      availability of force), and variations in the levels of intrusion allowed\u000a      (e.g. inspection or search). The research in this area is, inevitably, a\u000a      continuing process, since governments are continuously repealing or\u000a      amending old powers, or enacting new ones, in both primary and secondary\u000a      legislation.\u000a    The research revealed, and continues to reveal, the lack of any coherent\u000a      policy in relation to these powers. They are enacted in different ways, to\u000a      meet the specific needs of a particular department or groups of officials,\u000a      without any reference to how such powers are provided in similar\u000a      situations. This results in differences with no clear justification as to,\u000a      for example, whether obstruction of a person exercising the power is a\u000a      specific offence, or as to who has the power to authorise the use of the\u000a      power. This is true both for those powers which have been on the statute\u000a      book for many years, and those that are newly enacted.\u000a    The result of this lack of clarity and transparency is that individuals\u000a      who are subject to these powers, and whose premises may be entered, will\u000a      have great difficulty in discovering whether the official purporting to\u000a      exercise the power is acting lawfully or not. Indeed, the officials\u000a      themselves may not always be aware of the precise extent of or limitations\u000a      on their powers, thus increasing the risk that they will be used\u000a      inappropriately.\u000a    The research highlighted the need for the development of general\u000a      principles applying to all entry and search powers used by those other\u000a      than the police. This reform has now been achieved by means of the\u000a      Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31861","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    &#160;In terms of the range of the impact, as has been noted\u000d      above, dispute resolution is of major importance in underpinning civil\u000d      society and as a business. The rules relating to funding and costs of\u000d      litigation are important for access to justice, reduction in insurance\u000d      premiums (particularly in personal injury cases), and for the health of a\u000d      very large service industry. Over 1.5 million civil (non-family) cases\u000d      were started in 2011 (Ministry of Justice, Judicial and Court\u000d        statistics 2011 (published 2012)), and in 2012 the Law Society\u000d      reported that there were 128,778 practising solicitors in 10,102 firms.\u000d      All of these firms, and their clients, both UK based and international,\u000d      will be affected by changes in the ways in which cases are financed and\u000d      costs regulated. Five specific examples of the impact of the research\u000d      listed in 3 above are set out below. \u000d    i. 2009: Advice was given to Jackson LJ in a confidential meeting in\u000d      relation to his Review of Civil Litigation Costs, and Peysner also spoke\u000d      at meetings he attended. As indicated above, the Review proposed that\u000d      fixed fees, cost budgeting and a form of contingency fees should be\u000d      introduced (damage based agreements); the latter to replace recoverable\u000d      conditional fees which defendant insurers had to pay with the objective of\u000d      reducing motor and house insurance premiums. These are all policy\u000d      objectives that arise from Professor Peysner's research and his\u000d      conclusions on policy reforms required. These proposals have been\u000d      implemented in 2013 through the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of\u000d      Offenders Act 2012 (sections 44 to 47) and changes in rules of court. \u000d    ii. 2010\/2013: Involvement in Jackson 'Review of Civil Litigation Costs'\u000d      (above) led to an invitation to speak at the Holyrood Policy Conference,\u000d      Edinburgh, offering an English perspective on the Report of the\u000d        Scottish Civil Courts Review ('The Gill Review'). Peysner debated\u000d      the issues with another speaker, Sheriff Taylor, a member of the Gill\u000d      Review. This led to Peysner's approach on referral fees being taken up by\u000d      the following government review: 'Review of Expenses and Funding of Civil\u000d      Litigation in Scotland' (Taylor Review) (11\/9\/2013) - eg Ch 10, para 48:\u000d      In 2008, John Peysner, Professor of Law at the University\u000d        of Lincoln, predicted the impact of a prohibition of referral fees once\u000d        alternative business structures had been permitted in England and Wales&#8230;\u000d        'Referral fees between lawyers and brokers or insurers will be replaced\u000d        by transfer pricing within vertically integrated organisations. If these\u000d        arrangements are outside regulation but the remaining firms surviving\u000d        outside the corporate umbrella remain subject to the full rigor of\u000d        discipline, it is difficult to see how this can be sustained'. In June\u000d        2012, the SRA [Solicitors Regulation Authority] addressed the\u000d        concern that businesses may become alternative business structures in\u000d        order to circumvent the ban. So long as the formal requirements for\u000d        authorisation are met, the SRA could see no grounds on which to prevent\u000d        such arrangements, even where they are made explicitly to circumvent the\u000d        ban. It could be said that Peysner's comment was prescient. \u000d    iii. 2008: Representative Actions and Restorative Justice (2008)\u000d      - this report was commissioned by the Department of Business Enterprise\u000d      and Regulatory Reform (BERR) and its successor department, the Department\u000d      for Business, Innovation and Skills, adopted the proposal put forward by\u000d      Peysner and Nurse in the BERR report for pilot enforcement trials, which\u000d      were then carried out. It also adopted and announced the Consumer Advocate\u000d      (the Consumer Ombudsman proposal), and advertised the post as Chair of\u000d      Consumer Focus with the education role first and the Ombudsman powers to\u000d      follow. The Law Commission's Consultation Paper on Consumer Redress for\u000d      Misrepresentation and Aggressive Practices (LCCP 199\/SLCDP 149) makes\u000d      reference (page 47) to the BERR report in relation to compensation orders,\u000d      and (at page 51) in relation to the civil sanctions pilot. \u000d    iv.

For example, research into the\u000d      effect of delay in increasing costs (Peysner and Nurse's data analysis for\u000d      National Accident Helpline (2011)), and into court fees (through a\u000d      literature review for the Civil Justice Council (unpublished internal\u000d      document, 2011)), culminated in Peysner's interventions in the Jackson\u000d      Review (2009), following which all of these proposals were implemented in\u000d      the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 and court\u000d      rules. \u000d    (b) Innovative Financing Systems (i) Peysner was commissioned to\u000d      undertake desk research and empirical research (interviews) for the\u000d      Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission (2005-8) into the proposal for\u000d      a Contingency Legal Aid Fund to largely replace civil legal aid. This\u000d      included research into the operation of the Personal Injury Assessment\u000d      Board in the Republic of Ireland, and also involved advising officials and\u000d      the committee, including writing internal papers. The model proposed was\u000d      accepted by the Commission, but did not proceed owing to technical issues\u000d      with the role of the Accounting Officer and boundary issues between\u000d      Westminster and the Assembly government. \u000d    (ii) Peysner and Nurse, with Professor Hodges of the Centre for\u000d      Socio-Legal Centre, University of Oxford, carried out research into the\u000d      development and regulation of Third Party Funding for \u000d    commercial litigation funded by the global re-insurance company Swiss Re.\u000d      This involved semi-structured interviews with legal practitioners and\u000d      funders and desk research into bars to Third Party Funding including the\u000d      comparative context. The research established: that this model was more\u000d      widespread than had been believed; and that it was growing in scope and\u000d      could safely be self-regulated, unless and until it moved into the\u000d      consumer area. \u000d    (c) Appropriate and Efficient Dispute Resolution  \u000d    (i) Research was commissioned in 2008 by the Department for Business,\u000d      Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) into the need for, and mechanisms\u000d      to achieve, satisfactory compensation for groups of consumers, where they\u000d      have suffered detriment. The research used qualitative and quantitative\u000d      methods. Structured questionnaires to trading standards\/enforcement\u000d      officers were used to obtain quantitative data relating to the number of\u000d      consumer protection cases each year. Qualitative questions were also\u000d      designed to obtain views on restorative justice and representative actions\u000d      from enforcers, regulators and consumer groups. Interviews were carried\u000d      out with trading standards officers, other enforcers and regulators,\u000d      consumer groups and representatives, and some business representatives. A\u000d      BERR workshop on Restorative Justice was held at the Trading Standards\u000d      Institute Conference. \u000d    (ii) European consumers have been subject to particular detriment by\u000d      cartel and other anti-competitive activity without effective remedy.\u000d      Peysner's work has contributed to developing new initiatives of access to\u000d      justice in this area. Research was carried out with Professors Rodgers \u000d    (Strathclyde) and Riley (City University) into the impact of European\u000d      Commission proposals on the regulation of actions for breach of European\u000d      antitrust rules (i.e. Making antitrust damages actions more effective\u000d        in the EU: welfare impact and potential scenarios, Experts'\u000d      Report for Centre for European Policy Studies, Brussels, and the European\u000d      Commission (DG Comp)).

Cunningham's research has had the greatest impact\u000d\u000a      through her work\u000d\u000a      with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). ACPO is the body\u000d\u000a      which leads and\u000d\u000a      coordinates the direction and development of the police service in\u000d\u000a      England, Wales and Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland independently of the government. ACPO, on behalf of all chief\u000d\u000a      officers, coordinates the\u000d\u000a      strategic policing response. Alongside (but independent of) the\u000d\u000a      Government's development of its\u000d\u000a      Strategic Framework for Road Safety in May 2011, ACPO saw the need to\u000d\u000a      develop a strategy for\u000d\u000a      road policing. Cunningham has acted as a `critical friend' to ACPO in\u000d\u000a      drafting the current five year\u000d\u000a      road policing strategy and she, alongside Sgt Alan Jones of ACPO Road\u000d\u000a      Policing, developed one\u000d\u000a      of the three strategic goals of the new strategy: \"habitual compliance\".\u000d\u000a      Sgt Jones states: \"A key\u000d\u000a        requirement of the document was [a] request that the guidance should\u000d\u000a        exhibit academic weight\u000d\u000a        and merit... Dr. Cunningham was an integral member of the syndicate,\u000d\u000a        chaired by myself, which\u000d\u000a        developed the theme of habitual compliance. In 2010, I [was] requested\u000d\u000a        to draft the new Road\u000d\u000a        Policing Strategy. ... Sally proved to be extremely helpful in [the peer\u000d\u000a        review] process and using\u000d\u000a        her specialist academic knowledge and insight was able to assist the\u000d\u000a        police service in the\u000d\u000a        development of the draft document.\" (5.6)\u000d\u000a    The key to the strategy of habitual compliance can be seen on p.4 of the\u000d\u000a      document (5.1, 5.6):\u000d\u000a      \"Roads policing needs to shift from a target driven approach to\u000d\u000a        performance, to one that enables\u000d\u000a        officers to use their discretion and professional judgement to deliver\u000d\u000a        safer roads and improved\u000d\u000a        driver behaviour. Working with partners and stakeholders our ambition\u000d\u000a        must be to create a shift in\u000d\u000a        public attitude and behaviour to one of habitual compliance with the\u000d\u000a        laws and conventions of the\u000d\u000a        road.\"\u000d\u000a    Habitual compliance is a concept which aims to encourage drivers to abide\u000d\u000a      by the law of the roads\u000d\u000a      as a matter of course, through educating drivers about the need to do so.\u000d\u000a      It allows for the\u000d\u000a      employment of education of offending drivers through enforcement and\u000d\u000a      recognises that, in relation\u000d\u000a      to low-end offending, psychologists have found that what amounts to\u000d\u000a      careless driving can only be\u000d\u000a      tackled via education, whereas at the top-end violations require\u000d\u000a      deterrence through punishment.\u000d\u000a      The concept of habitual compliance is key to the new police approach in\u000d\u000a      road policing, referred to\u000d\u000a      by Chief Constable Phil Gormley, Head of ACPO Road Policing in his\u000d\u000a      introduction to the strategy.\u000d\u000a      In his Ministerial Forward to the Strategy, Mike Penning MP, Parliamentary\u000d\u000a      Undersecretary of\u000d\u000a      State for Transport, declared that \"I expect [this new Road Policing\u000d\u000a        strategy] to make an important\u000d\u000a        contribution to reducing road casualties\" (5.1).\u000d\u000a    Elsewhere Cunningham's work has been recognised by PACTS, who have\u000d\u000a      invited her to present\u000d\u000a      papers at two conferences. PACTS is a registered charity and an associate\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary Group.\u000d\u000a      Its objective is \"To protect human life through the promotion of transport\u000d\u000a      safety for the public\u000d\u000a      benefit\". It aims to advise and inform members of parliament on road\u000d\u000a      safety issues, and brings\u000d\u000a      together safety professionals and legislators to identify research-based\u000d\u000a      solutions to transport safety\u000d\u000a      problems. One of Cunningham's papers (3.2) was published by PACTS\u000d\u000a      as an occasional research\u000d\u000a      report, to inform the development of the coming ten-year strategy for\u000d\u000a      enforcing traffic law. This led\u000d\u000a      to Cunningham taking part in an Enforcement and Education Seminar at the\u000d\u000a      Department for\u000d\u000a      Transport in January 2011, at which discussions took place regarding\u000d\u000a      development of that\u000d\u000a      strategy. Rob Gifford, Executive Director of PACTS until December 2012,\u000d\u000a      states: \"The number of\u000d\u000a        academic researchers involved in assessment of car crime and the\u000d\u000a        contribution to road death and\u000d\u000a        injury is (surprisingly) very small and Sally's work on dangerous\u000d\u000a        driving has provided the road\u000d\u000a        safety community with key insights into how to tackle this issue. I\u000d\u000a        first came across her work when\u000d\u000a        preparing the programme for a conference organized by PACTS in March\u000d\u000a        2008. I am certain that\u000d\u000a        her conclusions helped in demonstrating to the government that, in\u000d\u000a        tackling road crime, we need to\u000d\u000a        focus both on low-level regular offending such as speeding and high-harm\u000d\u000a        offending such as death\u000d\u000a        by dangerous driving and dangerous driving itself.\" (5.3)\u000d\u000a    Most recently, Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate\u000d\u000a      (HMCPSI) has used\u000d\u000a      Cunningham's final report to the CPS from her AHRC funded project to help\u000d\u000a      to formulate a scoping\u000d\u000a      document that will define the parameters of a joint review between HMCPSI\u000d\u000a      and Her Majesty's\u000d\u000a      Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) of criminal charges relating to road\u000d\u000a      traffic fatalities to be\u000d\u000a      undertaken in the final quarter of the 2013\/14 business year. The\u000d\u000a      assistant inspector in charge of\u000d\u000a      this review states in relation to Cunningham's report that: \"A vital\u000d\u000a        aspect of this inspection will focus\u000d\u000a        on the decisions on prosecution and charge selection made by prosecutors\u000d\u000a        in the period since\u000d\u000a        2008 when the new offences created by the Road Safety Act 2006 came into\u000d\u000a        force. It is therefore\u000d\u000a        instructive for me and my colleagues to see some of these decisions\u000d\u000a        analysed by professionals\u000d\u000a        from another discipline and more importantly from a source outside the\u000d\u000a        criminal justice fraternity.\"\u000d\u000a      (5.7)\u000d\u000a    Cunningham has been able to draw on her research to respond in detail to\u000d\u000a      consultations issued by\u000d\u000a      both ACPO, in relation to its new draft of the Road Death Investigation\u000d\u000a      Manual, and the CPS, on\u000d\u000a      their charging policy for offences relating to bad driving. In relation to\u000d\u000a      the latter, she also took part\u000d\u000a      in a panel discussion organised by the victims' charity RoadPeace in\u000d\u000a      November 2012 on the\u000d\u000a      guidance provided by the CPS on charging in relation to road traffic\u000d\u000a      fatalities. RoadPeace is an\u000d\u000a      organisation which has used Cunningham's monograph (3.1) to help\u000d\u000a      them understand the law\u000d\u000a      relating to causing death offences, feeding into their policies on\u000d\u000a      encouraging the authorities to treat\u000d\u000a      road crime as \"real\" crime. Amy Aeron-Thomas, Executive Director of\u000d\u000a      RoadPeace comments: \"The\u000d\u000a        importance of the research conducted by Dr Sally Cunningham should not\u000d\u000a        be underestimated...\u000d\u000a        RoadPeace has benefited from Dr Cunningham's presentations at our\u000d\u000a        previous conferences and\u000d\u000a        our Traffic Justice panel discussion last November, \"You say Careless, I\u000d\u000a        say Dangerous\". ... We\u000d\u000a        may not always agree with her but we do always learn from her\" (5.5).\u000d\u000a      Cunningham also took part\u000d\u000a      in the Police Foundation Forum on Roads Policing in December 2012, at\u000d\u000a      which the discussion\u000d\u000a      revolved around impacting policy on roads policing, particularly through\u000d\u000a      the new Police and Crimes\u000d\u000a      Commissioners, and called for the introduction of a Roads Accident\u000d\u000a      Investigation Branch (5.4).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    1,754 people were killed on Great Britain's roads in 2012, down from\u000d\u000a      1,901 in 2011 (a reduction of\u000d\u000a      8%).

Knowledge of the way in which\u000d\u000a      these offences operate in\u000d\u000a      practice was previously sparse, although anecdotal evidence raised\u000d\u000a      criticisms of practice such as\u000d\u000a      claims that drivers tended to be \"over-charged\", leading to a high rate of\u000d\u000a      failure in such cases.\u000d\u000a    Cunningham's initial research involved an empirical study of police and\u000d\u000a      Crown Prosecution Service\u000d\u000a      files relating to road-deaths, in an endeavour to increase knowledge on\u000d\u000a      such matters, and to inform\u000d\u000a      proposals for law reform. It involved the analysis of over 300 road-death\u000d\u000a      files across three counties\u000d\u000a      in the East Midlands, and explored the role of prosecutorial discretion in\u000d\u000a      such cases as well as\u000d\u000a      examining the difficulties faced by police and prosecutors investigating\u000d\u000a      and prosecuting offences\u000d\u000a      linked to road-death (3.2), She also addressed the question of\u000d\u000a      whether reform of the substantive\u000d\u000a      law was desirable. Cunningham used the results of her own empirical study\u000d\u000a      as well as drawing on\u000d\u000a      existing literature relating to the philosophy of the criminal law\u000d\u000a      generally and to criminological and\u000d\u000a      psychological explanations for breaches of traffic laws specifically in\u000d\u000a      the writing of articles and a\u000d\u000a      monograph. Psychologists have conducted numerous projects on drivers and\u000d\u000a      how and why risk-taking\u000d\u000a      on the roads occurs, which Cunningham has argued could be applied to\u000d\u000a      offence definitions\u000d\u000a      in order better to deter and prevent risk taking on the roads (3.1;\u000d\u000a      3.3, 3.4, 3.5).\u000d\u000a    For her monograph (3.1) Cunningham undertook a further study which\u000d\u000a      was comparative in nature,\u000d\u000a      involving the examination of the law and policy relating to driving\u000d\u000a      offences in Sweden. Sweden was\u000d\u000a      chosen due to the excellent safety record on the roads of that country.\u000d\u000a      Cunningham interviewed\u000d\u000a      police officers, policy makers and prosecutors in Sweden in order to\u000d\u000a      understand the law in practice\u000d\u000a      and to see if lessons could be learnt in the UK. The results are reported\u000d\u000a      in a chapter in the\u000d\u000a      monograph and were disseminated at a conference organised by the\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary Advisory\u000d\u000a      Council on Transport Safety (PACTS) in 2008. The findings suggest that it\u000d\u000a      is Swedish culture and\u000d\u000a      the use of education and engineering to promote road safety, rather than\u000d\u000a      law enforcement, which\u000d\u000a      is the secret behind Sweden's safety record (3.1; 5.2).\u000d\u000a    More recently, Cunningham has undertaken a study of how the law in this\u000d\u000a      area now operates\u000d\u000a      following the introduction of two new \"causing death\" offences in the Road\u000d\u000a      Safety Act 2006. The\u000d\u000a      study used similar methods to her earlier research to explore how the new\u000d\u000a      offences have affected\u000d\u000a      the use of discretion by police and Crown prosecutors, and whether the\u000d\u000a      offences are likely to have\u000d\u000a      met the objectives set out by the Government prior to the law being\u000d\u000a      enacted. Her results,\u000d\u000a      identifying best practice for the purpose of developing policy in this\u000d\u000a      area, are being fed back to the\u000d\u000a      police forces involved in the project (of which there are three), as well\u000d\u000a      as the Crown Prosecution\u000d\u000a      Service, and is already leading to outputs in the form of journal articles\u000d\u000a      (3.6).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32041","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Domestic violence is an area where public bodies and government have been\u000a      keen to demonstrate progress in improving their response. Both Labour and\u000a      the coalition government have produced plans for responding to domestic\u000a      violence. Burton's impact on policy making in domestic violence cases has\u000a      been partly as a result of direct involvement in advisory bodies\u000a      considering her own and others' research in this area. From 2001-2006,\u000a      whilst Labour were in power, Burton was a member of the Domestic Violence\u000a      Advisory Group (DVAG convened by the LCD\/MOJ). She as invited to be a\u000a      member of this group as a result of her expertise on the legal responses\u000a      to domestic violence and was the only academic member.\u000a    The group was mainly comprised of senior judiciary, police, prosecutors\u000a      and representatives of support agencies such as Refuge and Womens' Aid\u000a      Federation England (WAFE). The group contributed significantly to the\u000a      consultation paper Safety and Justice (Home Office, 2003) which in turn\u000a      informed the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004. Although the\u000a      legislation predates the impact period, it has ongoing impact as key\u000a      measures, such as criminalisation of the breach of non-molestation orders,\u000a      continue to influence the effectiveness of remedies available to victims\u000a      of domestic violence. The influence of the legislation was evaluated by\u000a      Burton for the LSC in 2009 (3.6 and 3.7). It appeared that\u000a      criminalisation might have reduced the number of protection orders made,\u000a      but Burton advised caution on drawing this conclusion and recommended more\u000a      effort be put into ensuring specialist solicitors were available to\u000a      support victims through the legal system.\u000a    One of the key policies considered by the DVAG in 2002 was whether third\u000a      parties, such as the police, should be empowered to apply for civil\u000a      remedies on behalf of victims of domestic violence. Research by Burton (as\u000a      lead researcher), was used to inform a decision not to proceed with a\u000a      pilot at that time (3.2). However, the government is currently\u000a      reviewing this policy and Burton's research is being used as a resource to\u000a      inform that review process. The current review is motivated by the pilots\u000a      of domestic violence prevention orders, and continuing concerns about\u000a      police handling of domestic violence complaints. Burton found that the\u000a      police were concerned about being authorised as third party applicants for\u000a      civil protection orders, and recommended fuller consideration of who might\u000a      be authorised as an applicant in order to ensure the measure is successful\u000a      if implemented.\u000a    Overall Burton's research showed that service providers were in favour of\u000a      a pilot of third party applications, if issues of consent of the victim\u000a      are appropriately handled (3.2). The Home Office considered this\u000a      research when setting up pilots of domestic violence prevention orders\u000a      (DVPOs) in 2010. In several recent House of Commons briefing papers,\u000a      Parliamentarians have been referred to Burton's research on third party\u000a      applications (see 5.3), and also to her research for the Legal\u000a      Services Commission (LSC) examining trends in applications for\u000a      non-molestation orders (see 5.1-5.3).\u000a    Burton was part of an interdisciplinary team who were responsible for\u000a      evaluating the first five Specialist Domestic Violence Courts (SDVCs) in\u000a      England and Wales. Although some of these courts had been evaluated\u000a      individually, there was no study examining the features of best practice\u000a      for court specialisation by examining different models. The research\u000a      looked at best practice across the five courts and compared this with\u000a      other jurisdictions. The findings of this research, reported in 2003-4,\u000a      informed a decision by the MoJ and the CPS to introduce two more pilot\u000a      domestic violence courts experimenting with different models. Both the\u000a      original five court evaluation and the evaluation of the CPS pilot courts\u000a      (carried out in 2003-4) found that independent advocacy support for\u000a      victims of domestic violence was crucial to increasing their safety and\u000a      wellbeing.\u000a    The evaluation showed that the development of specialist courts was\u000a      central to the delivery of that support, and also helped to increase the\u000a      sensitivity of practitioners, especially magistrates, to the dynamics of\u000a      abuse; it contributed to attitudinal change and some improved outcomes,\u000a      although victim withdrawal remained high. As the research showed that\u000a      court specialisation did improve victims' experiences of the criminal\u000a      justice system, the two SDVC projects led to the decision to roll out\u000a      SDVCs nationally.\u000a    Within a few years, there were over 100 such courts and they formed a\u000a      central plank of Labour government policy to improve criminal justice\u000a      response to domestic violence (Safety with Justice, 2008, Home Office).\u000a      Court specialisation remains a key feature of criminal justice policy\u000a      (Swift and Sure, Home Office, 2012).\u000a    Outside government, Burton's research on the civil remedies for domestic\u000a      violence has been of interest to a wide range of third sector agencies and\u000a      practitioners. The outcomes of the research for the LSC, and\u000a      recommendations for more effective delivery of advice for victims of\u000a      domestic abuse, were discussed in a number of journals which have a\u000a      practitioner audience (such as Family Law) and WAFE published an article\u000a      for their Journal `Safe'. She is regularly contacted by third sector\u000a      support agencies for information about her research to inform their\u000a      campaigning and advisory services.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Domestic violence is a serious and pernicious problem, affecting one in\u000a      four women, and a significant number of men.

She has produced numerous\u000a      reports for policymakers and articles for practitioners and participated\u000a      in policy making bodies as an academic expert. All of this work has been\u000a      done whilst she has been at the University of Leicester (from 2001),\u000a      sometimes in collaboration with colleagues at Leicester or other\u000a      Universities. It has been concerned with examining the limitations of the\u000a      law and the gap between the law and practice in domestic violence cases.\u000a      The research has identified how protection afforded to victims of domestic\u000a      violence falls short of meeting their needs, and how the law and practice\u000a      might be improved (3.1).\u000a    In 2002 she completed a study of the civil remedies for domestic violence\u000a      for the Lord Chancellor's Department (forbear of the MOJ), examining the\u000a      issue of whether third parties should be able to apply for civil remedies\u000a      on behalf of victims. This informed a decision not to proceed with pilots\u000a      of third party applications at that time, but to strengthen the\u000a      enforcement mechanism for non-molestation orders (3.2).\u000a    She then went on, as part of an interdisciplinary team, to complete two\u000a      studies of specialist domestic violence courts for the Ministry of Justice\u000a      and Crown Prosecution Service (2003-5). The original team comprised four\u000a      academics (Burton, Cook, Robinson and Vallely; see below for affiliations)\u000a      and each was responsible for collecting and analysing the data and\u000a      reporting the findings to policy makers.

The team for the follow on\u000a      evaluation comprised three of the original academics and a research\u000a      associate (3.4) The original report recommended that specialist\u000a      domestic violence courts be expanded. The follow on report made\u000a      recommendations as to the best models for doing this and both reports\u000a      informed the national roll out of the specialist domestic violence court\u000a      programme (3.5).\u000a    In 2009 she was asked by the Legal Services Commission (LSC) to examine\u000a      why there had been a decline in applications for non-molestation orders\u000a      (civil protection orders for victims of domestic violence) under the\u000a      Family Law Act 1996. She analysed trends in applications and\u000a      contextualised those within the literature, making specific policy\u000a      recommendations as to how the downward trend might be reversed (3.6\u000a      and 3.7).\u000a    Affiliations of researchers: Mandy Burton (University of\u000a      Leicester), Trevor Buck (University of Leicester, 1989-2006), Dee Cook and\u000a      Christine Vallely (University of Wolverhampton), Amanda Robinson (Cardiff\u000a      University).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32050","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact on government, regulatory bodies, industry and charities\u000d\u000a      This research has changed the approach taken by regulators, policy makers\u000d\u000a      and industry to the issue of identifying and responding to the needs of\u000d\u000a      consumers in vulnerable situations.

Many of our policies to help these\u000d\u000a        households are focussed on energy companies and having a clearer\u000d\u000a        understanding of the barriers that they face helps us to develop and\u000d\u000a        implement policies in ways that help ensure that they meet our wider\u000d\u000a        objectives.

He has made\u000d\u000a      presentations on the research to the group in May 2011 and September 2013\u000d\u000a      and has been an active participant in developing policy within the group,\u000d\u000a      doing the initial drafting for a significant part of the report which will\u000d\u000a      be presented to the Citizens' Energy Forum in London in December 2013. The\u000d\u000a      research had a direct impact on the ways in which the Commission has\u000d\u000a      framed the problem, in terms of its discussion of the drivers of\u000d\u000a      vulnerability (as opposed to the traditional approach to framing the\u000d\u000a      problem in terms of vulnerable groups) (5.1).\u000d\u000a    Graham was also a member of Ofwat's Future Regulation Advisory Panel in\u000d\u000a      2012 where he was part of a group providing feedback to Ofwat on the\u000d\u000a      development of its regulatory policy (5.7).\u000d\u000a    Partly as a result of her involvement in the research, Lennard became the\u000d\u000a      Chair of the Public Utilities Access Forum (PUAF) in 2012, having\u000d\u000a      previously been Vice Chair from 2010. Here she plays an active role in\u000d\u000a      influencing the future direction of the Forum which includes regulatory\u000d\u000a      representatives as well as consumer bodies and voluntary organisations. In\u000d\u000a      particular, she played a central part in re-launching PUAF this year as\u000d\u000a      Essential Services Action Network (ESAN) with a wider remit and\u000d\u000a      membership. She is also a member of Ofgem's Consumer Challenge Group which\u000d\u000a      is currently involved in advising Ofgem on the next electricity\u000d\u000a      distribution price control from the consumer standpoint.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Complaint handling\u000d\u000a      The work CCES has carried out on complaint handling for both Ofcom and\u000d\u000a      Consumer Focus (CF) has provided an underpinning advice base for their\u000d\u000a      respective policy development on complaint handling by providers and\u000d\u000a      independent organisations (5.5). In its most recent policy paper (5.4),\u000a      CF has emphasised that society cannot simply or easily be divided into\u000d\u000a      `vulnerable groups' and `the rest'. People's circumstances change and\u000d\u000a      anybody can become vulnerable at any time, for example through job loss or\u000d\u000a      bereavement. In addition, CF stated that that the policies and practices\u000d\u000a      of service and product suppliers in different markets can heavily\u000d\u000a      influence the choices available, the decisions people make and the extent\u000d\u000a      to which people are in vulnerable positions (see 5.4)\u000d\u000a    International influence\u000d\u000a      International impact came when Graham was invited to provide a keynote\u000d\u000a      address for the ACCAN (Australian Communications Consumer Action Network)\u000d\u000a      national conference in Melbourne on 28 June 2010, as well as participating\u000d\u000a      fully in the conference itself. The problems in relation to\u000d\u000a      telecommunications complaints led to an investigation by the Australian\u000d\u000a      Communication and Media Authority and Graham's research was cited in their\u000d\u000a      final report (5.6). The work (3.3.and 3.4) has also\u000d\u000a      been extended to include work on complaints in the legal services field\u000d\u000a      for the Legal Ombudsman and discussion of relevant issues with the Legal\u000d\u000a      Services Board in the UK (5.3).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Essential services such as energy and water supply have, over the past\u000d\u000a      three decades, been privatised by the British government with some\u000d\u000a      reported negative results. One problem which became severe after\u000d\u000a      privatisation is how to combine competitive markets with access to\u000d\u000a      essential services because consumers in vulnerable circumstances find it\u000d\u000a      difficult to obtain the best deals and good service.

Throughout this REF period the Director has been Professor Cosmo\u000d\u000a      Graham, collaborating with Professor Sommerlad (Oct 2010 &#8212; March 2013),\u000d\u000a      the late Martin Fitch (1999-2006), Linda Lennard and Mike George. Fitch\u000d\u000a      was and Lennard is a Visiting Fellow at Leicester while George is an\u000d\u000a      associate with CCES. The research carried out by CCES has two,\u000d\u000a      inter-related strands.\u000d\u000a    The first strand is conceptual and provides an account of how the\u000d\u000a      regulation of essential services in the UK has changed and the\u000d\u000a      implications of this at a constitutional level (3.1, 3.2).\u000d\u000a      This can be characterised as a move from public ownership to private\u000d\u000a      ownership and reliance on market driven devices. There has always been\u000d\u000a      recognition that these services are \"essential\" and therefore there should\u000d\u000a      be universal access to them, including by people in disadvantaged\u000d\u000a      circumstances. This leads to the second strand of research examining the\u000d\u000a      practical and policy measures by which the tension between market devices\u000d\u000a      and social policy aims is mediated (3.3-3.6).\u000d\u000a    In the period 2008-13, this second strand has focused on two particular\u000d\u000a      issues: changing the perceptions of vulnerability held by policy-makers,\u000d\u000a      regulators and industry and improving the practical working of complaint\u000d\u000a      handling systems. The legislation for essential services requires\u000d\u000a      regulators to have regard to the interests of specified, vulnerable\u000d\u000a      `groups', such as older and disabled people, and to apply this in\u000d\u000a      requirements placed on companies. The research (3.4 and 3.6)\u000d\u000a      shows that this approach fails to reflect the reality that consumer\u000d\u000a      vulnerability is complex and multi-dimensional, driven by a number of\u000d\u000a      factors which are much wider than, for example, poverty and age.\u000d\u000a      Vulnerability may come about because of long-standing health issues and\u000d\u000a      family circumstances, for example, and also as a result of sudden life\u000d\u000a      events such as unemployment, bereavement or having to take on caring\u000d\u000a      responsibilities. Having learning disabilities or a lack of literacy may\u000d\u000a      make it difficult to navigate the energy market and access appropriate\u000d\u000a      help and advice. The group approach also fails to recognise that\u000d\u000a      vulnerability may be dynamic or transient, and that people may slip into\u000d\u000a      and out of vulnerability. It also leads to assumptions that everyone\u000d\u000a      within specific groups are by definition vulnerable but many do not view\u000d\u000a      themselves as vulnerable. Moreover, it ignores the critical roles of\u000d\u000a      markets and providers which frequently contribute to or exacerbate\u000d\u000a      vulnerability.\u000d\u000a    The aim of the research has been to influence policy makers and providers\u000d\u000a      to adopt a more accurate approach to vulnerability enabling them to\u000d\u000a      develop more effective policies and practices. Recent research in this\u000d\u000a      area has been funded by the eaga Charitable Trust (an independent\u000d\u000a      grant-giving trust that currently supports projects and research that\u000d\u000a      contribute to combating fuel poverty and ensuring that energy services are\u000d\u000a      fair and accessible for all groups in society), and focused on information\u000d\u000a      and advice for people facing multiple barriers in the energy sector and\u000d\u000a      current research on disabled people's energy costs and needs. This has\u000d\u000a      been followed up through work funded by Ofgem.\u000d\u000a    An important part of protecting consumers in vulnerable circumstances is\u000d\u000a      the existence of effective complaint handling regimes, both internal to\u000d\u000a      providers and external to them, in order that problems may be resolved\u000d\u000a      when things go wrong in timely and accessible ways. This has been an area\u000d\u000a      which has been neglected as providers have concentrated on growing market\u000d\u000a      share and regulators have concentrated on more structural issues. The\u000d\u000a      research (3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5) sets out a\u000d\u000a      best principles approach to complaint handling and demonstrates how good\u000d\u000a      complaint handling systems may lead to systemic improvements in service,\u000d\u000a      rather than simply dealing with individual cases.\u000d\u000a    Lennard and George are independent researchers not employed by an HEI.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32733","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact derived from Alldridge's research relates to his work with the\u000d\u000a      Law Commission Bribery Advisory Group from 2007 and the subsequent advice\u000d\u000a      on the draft Bribery Bill in 2009 and the Bribery Act in 2010. This impact\u000d\u000a      arose from earlier advisory work on the draft Corruption Bill in 2003 and\u000d\u000a      evidence given to the OECD delegation on bribery in international business\u000d\u000a      transactions, which are outside the REF impact assessment period but which\u000d\u000a      provide contextual background to the later impact achieved. As a result of\u000d\u000a      Alldridge's involvement in this legal formation, the UK now has a reformed\u000d\u000a      law of bribery, which is compliant with the requirements of the OECD\u000d\u000a      convention.\u000d\u000a    Earlier contextual advice and evidence on corruption and bribery\u000d\u000a          (2003-2008)\u000d\u000a      In 2003, the government introduced a draft Corruption Bill (Jan 2003, Cm\u000d\u000a      5777), for consideration by a Joint Parliamentary Committee. This draft\u000d\u000a      Bill itself was based on the Law Commission's 1998 report, and contained a\u000d\u000a      defence of consent, premised on the view that the principal-agent nexus\u000d\u000a      stood at the heart of bribery law. The procedure around bills is designed\u000d\u000a      to enable a parliamentary committee to consider a range of possible\u000d\u000a      solutions to a problem, and so the Committee (chaired by Lord Slynn of\u000d\u000a      Hadley) appointed Alldridge (who took a different view of the law,\u000d\u000a      reflected in his published work) as specialist adviser. Alldridge wrote\u000d\u000a      many of the questions put by the Committee to witnesses before it,\u000d\u000a      including all those put to Lord Falconer (the Lord Chancellor) and Lord\u000d\u000a      Goldsmith (the Attorney General). The Report from the Joint Committee on\u000d\u000a      the Draft Corruption Bill also contained an annex written by Professor\u000d\u000a      Alldridge setting out his views: `Annex 4: Note by Peter Alldridge,\u000d\u000a      specialist adviser, on locating the harm in bribery and corruption &#8212; an\u000d\u000a      alternative approach' (www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/jt200203\/jtselect\/jtcorr\/157\/157.pdf).\u000d\u000a    Related to this activity, in 2004 and 2008 the Working Group on Bribery\u000d\u000a      in International Business Transaction of the OECD conducted site visits to\u000d\u000a      the UK. Such visits are the primary means by which the `soft law'\u000d\u000a      obligations set out in the Convention are enforced (OECD Convention\u000d\u000a      Article 12). The purpose of the visit was to encourage the UK government\u000d\u000a      to enact legislation on bribery. The OECD's visits were motivated by its\u000d\u000a      increasing concern that the UK government was not complying with its\u000d\u000a      obligations under the Convention. As part of this process, the delegation\u000d\u000a      interviewed witnesses, including academic experts. Alldridge gave evidence\u000d\u000a      to this delegation in 2004 and 2008. In its 2008 report, the Working Group\u000d\u000a      cited the view of panelists consulted (including Alldridge) that the\u000d\u000a      consent of a principal should not constitute a defence in bribery cases,\u000d\u000a      and noted (para 39) that: \"principal consent at a minimum interferes with\u000d\u000a      the investigation and prosecution of foreign bribery cases in practice.\" (www.oecd.org\/dataoecd\/23\/20\/41515077.pdf)\u000d\u000a    Membership of the Law Commission Bribery Advisory Group and\u000d\u000a          alteration of consent defence principle\u000d\u000a      Assembled from March 2007, Alldridge was a member of the Law Commission\u000d\u000a      Bribery Advisory Group, in which he continued to put his view forward to\u000d\u000a      the British civil service. Alldridge's interventions were crucial in\u000d\u000a      altering the British government's position on the consent defence. In a\u000d\u000a      consultation paper produced in 2007, the Law Commission adhered to its\u000d\u000a      previous position that bribery is a crime against loyalty and not the\u000d\u000a      market (Law Commission Consultation Paper No 185, Reforming Bribery (LCCP\u000d\u000a      185, 2007)). It set out an answer to the position expounded by Alldridge\u000d\u000a      (in Annex 4 to the Report from the Joint Committee on the Draft Corruption\u000d\u000a      Bill) in an appendix (Appendix D &#8212; `The Harm in Bribery &#8212; Individual or\u000d\u000a      Market-Based?' pp. 264-279). The Commission felt that bribery should not\u000d\u000a      be conceived as anti-competitive behaviour (which was sufficiently\u000d\u000a      prevented by other offences). Instead, it recommended a version of the\u000d\u000a      bribery offence that turned upon the existence, among other things, of\u000d\u000a      prior duties (to act impartially, to act in good faith or to be in a\u000d\u000a      position of trust). During the consultation period, which ran until March\u000d\u000a      2008, Alldridge gave a paper to a conference at the Home Office (later\u000d\u000a      published [1]), which pointed out the flaws in this approach. He showed\u000d\u000a      that some of the duties envisaged by the Law Commission could only be\u000d\u000a      found in contracts, usually contracts of employment. Since they were set\u000d\u000a      out in contracts, they could be altered by contracts, and where this\u000d\u000a      occurred, it would create a defence of the consent of the principal.\u000d\u000a      Alldridge showed that bribery laws all over the world are directed to\u000d\u000a      protect competition.\u000d\u000a    As a result of this paper, the Law Commission changed its view. It\u000d\u000a      produced a further report in 2008 (Law Commission 313, Reforming\u000d\u000a        Bribery), which refers to Alldridge's 2008 paper published in Criminal\u000a        Law Review (2008) [1] and accepted that the argument made was \"a\u000d\u000a      very important objection\" (para 3.91). It also made substantial changes to\u000d\u000a      the proposal in the Consultation Paper. In particular, the Commission\u000d\u000a      accepted (finally, but not expressly) that bribery is a crime directed\u000d\u000a      against anti-competitive behaviour and replaced the idea of `duty' with\u000d\u000a      one of reasonable expectation, thereby avoiding the problem to which\u000d\u000a      Alldridge had drawn attention.\u000d\u000a    Advice on the draft Bribery Bill (2009)\u000d\u000a      In 2009, the Government introduced a draft Bribery Bill along the lines\u000d\u000a      proposed by the Law Commission. Alldridge was again appointed specialist\u000d\u000a      adviser to the Committee, this time chaired by Viscount Colville. He\u000d\u000a      contributed to questions and the debate in the Committee and to a report,\u000d\u000a      which was much more clearly focused upon ensuring compliance to the OECD\u000d\u000a      Convention. The Committee reported in July 2009 (29 July 2009 HL 115 HC\u000d\u000a      430 I and II). It endorsed the Bill, which was vastly improved compared to\u000d\u000a      the 2003 Bill. Thanks were given to Alldridge for his contribution. In\u000d\u000a      2010, the Bribery Act was passed, and came into force in April 2011.\u000d\u000a    Alldridge's work had a wide reach during the process of reform. Firstly,\u000d\u000a      his work had an impact on the parliamentary process, where he acted as a\u000d\u000a      specialist advisor to two Joint Committees on Draft Bills on corruption\u000d\u000a      and bribery, one of which took place during the REF2014 period. Secondly,\u000d\u000a      he had an impact on the Law Commission, which drew up the legislation,\u000d\u000a      shaping key aspects of the legislation. Thirdly, both prior to and during\u000d\u000a      the REF2014 period, he had an impact on the Organisation of Economic\u000d\u000a      Co-operation and Development's Working Group on Bribery in International\u000d\u000a      Business Transactions, which sought to ensure that the United Kingdom\u000d\u000a      complied with its obligations under the Paris Convention on the Bribery of\u000d\u000a      Foreign Public Officials. Fourthly, beyond such official bodies,\u000d\u000a      Alldridge's research has influenced public understanding of bribery in\u000d\u000a      international business transactions. He explained and analysed this issue\u000d\u000a      during the period of reform in numerous interviews with news and broadcast\u000d\u000a      media (including the New York Times, the BBC and CNN), and at\u000d\u000a      seminars and symposia open to non-academic audiences. The outcome of this\u000d\u000a      research &#8212; the legislation itself &#8212; has had a reach not merely to the\u000d\u000a      United Kingdom, but to all business transactions worldwide.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Alldridge's research rethinking the theoretical underpinnings\u000d\u000a      of the law of bribery has had a direct influence on the recent reforms of\u000d\u000a      the British law of bribery. With the coming into force of the Human Rights\u000d\u000a      Act 1998 and the OECD's Paris Convention on the Bribery of Foreign Public\u000d\u000a      Officials in 1999, the UK government was required to reform the law of\u000d\u000a      bribery. A Bill was drawn up in 2003, based on a report from the Law\u000d\u000a      Commission, which included a defence of consent (this allowed defendant\u000d\u000a      employers to argue that they could not be prosecuted for bribing foreign\u000d\u000a      customers, where the bribery had been effected by one of their employees\u000d\u000a      and the defendant employer had consented to this). The Commission saw\u000d\u000a      bribery not as anti-competitive behavior, but a crime against loyalty, a\u000d\u000a      conception that turned upon the existence of prior duties (to act\u000d\u000a      impartially, in good faith and to be in a position of trust). Through his\u000d\u000a      membership of the Law Commission Bribery Advisory Group, Alldridge was\u000d\u000a      able to show in 2008 that some of these duties could only be found in\u000d\u000a      contracts. As such, they could also be altered by contract, and where this\u000d\u000a      occurred, it would create a defence of the consent of the principal. As a\u000d\u000a      result of Alldridge's research and related membership of the Advisory\u000d\u000a      group, the 2009 Bill was amended, and the Act passed in 2010 did not allow\u000d\u000a      such a defence. The UK now has a reformed law of bribery, which complies\u000d\u000a      with the OECD convention and has been put on rational foundations.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen Mary, University of London","InstitutionName":"Queen Mary, University of London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007775}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aThe primary piece of underpinning research is reported in: [1] P.\u000d\u000a      Alldridge (2008) `Reforming Bribery: Law Commission Consultation Paper'\u000d\u000a      (2008) Criminal Law Review, 9: 671-81.\u000d\u000a    \u000aThis publication built on earlier research by Alldridge reported in, but\u000d\u000a      not claimed as underpinning research for the impact described in Section\u000d\u000a      4:\u000d\u000a    \u000a[2] P.

The research has taken the form of a publication in a\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed journal, Criminal Law Review [1]. This publication\u000d\u000a      developed and extended earlier research reported in another peer-reviewed\u000d\u000a      journal article prior to Alldridge's employment at Queen Mary from 2003\u000d\u000a      [2]. The Criminal Law Review paper [1], which provides the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research for the impact discussed in section 4, went through\u000d\u000a      a rigorous peer-review process prior to publication.\u000d\u000a    In this work, Alldridge challenges the view that bribery is an offence\u000d\u000a      against the relationship between principal and agent. According to this\u000d\u000a      view, a person (the agent) &#8212; often a lower official in a company &#8212; offends\u000d\u000a      by breaching the duty of loyalty they owe to their employer (the\u000d\u000a      principal), who receives a smaller price, or a worse deal, for the goods\u000d\u000a      they have to sell as a result of the corrupt activity of their agent.\u000d\u000a      Alldridge argues that this approach to the offence should be rejected. He\u000d\u000a      points out that while in criminal law, the consent of the victim is\u000d\u000a      usually a complete defence to a criminal charge, applied to bribery, this\u000d\u000a      leads to an anomaly &#8212; if an employer consents to their agents accepting a\u000d\u000a      bribe, then there is a defence to any charge of bribery. This is\u000d\u000a      unsatisfactory, since the real victims of the bribery may be other\u000d\u000a      competitors in the market, who have not consented to the bribery. In\u000d\u000a      Alldridge's view, bribery should be seen as an offence against the market,\u000d\u000a      not against the principal. It is the corruption of a market, not the\u000d\u000a      corruption of a relationship. Furthermore, Alldridge's research shows that\u000d\u000a      some of the duties envisaged by the Law Commission could only be found in\u000d\u000a      contracts, usually contracts of employment. Since they were set out in\u000d\u000a      contracts, they could be altered by contracts, and where this occurred, it\u000d\u000a      would create a defence of the consent of the principal.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32745","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact from this body of research can be divided into primary and\u000d\u000a      secondary impact.\u000d\u000a    Primary impact can be identified particularly in respect of the\u000d\u000a      influence of the research reports prepared for the DTI and BIS.\u000d\u000a    The findings of the 2005 report (2) were utilised in preparing the\u000d\u000a      Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, which implement\u000d\u000a      the UCPD into domestic law. The Regulations repealed around 30 existing\u000d\u000a      pieces of consumer law and thereby greatly simplified this area of\u000d\u000a      legislation. The partial Regulatory Impact Assessment published with the\u000d\u000a      consultation on the Regulations (URN 06\/2122) contains a list of measures\u000d\u000a      to be repealed, and this was carried through into the regulations\u000d\u000a      (Schedules 2 and 4 to the 2008 Regulation contain a list of legislation\u000d\u000a      that was amended or repealed, which is based on the measures indentified\u000d\u000a      in the 2005 report). This list reflects the recommendations made in the\u000d\u000a      report to simplify the overall regulatory landscape (having dismissed the\u000d\u000a      alternative of amending many measures to comply with the requirements of\u000d\u000a      the UCPD).\u000d\u000a    Between 2006 and 2010, Professor Twigg-Flesner (together with Deborah\u000d\u000a      Parry and Rick Canavan in some instances) were involved in a number of\u000d\u000a      meetings at the DTI\/BIS to discuss the potential for further-reaching\u000d\u000a      reform of consumer law, building on the research undertaken in 2005. These\u000d\u000a      discussions related, in particular, to the need to consolidate and\u000d\u000a      simplify the law relating to the sale and supply of goods. As a result of\u000d\u000a      the discussions, in 2010 BIS commissioned research (1), and the resulting\u000d\u000a      report has influenced work (evidenced by references in consultation\u000d\u000a      documents and Explanatory Notes) leading towards the introduction of the\u000d\u000a      Consumer Rights Bill (draft bill published on 12 June 2013), which will\u000d\u000a      consolidate and simplify many of the provisions of the law relating to the\u000d\u000a      sale and supply of goods in one Act.

For example, the\u000d\u000a      research on the UCPD (especially in (2)) formed the basis for discussions\u000d\u000a      about the Law Commission's advice on a private right of redress (November\u000d\u000a      2008) and further pre-consultation discussions on consumer redress for\u000d\u000a      misleading and aggressive practices.\u000d\u000a    Based on published research (3) and (4), Professor Twigg-Flesner was\u000d\u000a      invited by House of Lords Select Committee on the European Union\u000d\u000a      (Sub-Committee G) to give written and oral evidence for its enquiry into\u000d\u000a      the proposed Consumer Rights Directive.

Hull-based staff contributed about 60% of the overall work.\u000d\u000a      The report was commissioned to explore the actual impact of the EU Unfair\u000d\u000a      Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD), once adopted, on domestic consumer\u000d\u000a      law. The DTI requested information about what needed to be done in order\u000d\u000a      to implement the Directive into domestic law, and also the scope for\u000d\u000a      further simplification of domestic consumer law. The report considered the\u000d\u000a      case for both repealing existing legislation and modifying this to bring\u000d\u000a      it into line with the UCPD (see also (5) for a critical discussion). It\u000d\u000a      concluded that, whilst it was possible to amend existing legislation to\u000d\u000a      bring it into compliance, there was considerable scope for simplification\u000d\u000a      of the regulatory regime in respect of consumer transactions.\u000d\u000a    The second report (1) was directed by Professors Geraint Howells\u000d\u000a      (University of Manchester) and Professor Twigg-Flesner, with Rick Canavan\u000d\u000a      (Lecturer 2008 to present), Deborah Parry (see above), Andrew Bell,\u000d\u000a      Annette Nordhausen Scholes and Chris Willett (see Section 4), and was\u000d\u000a      produced during summer\/autumn 2010 and published in November 2010.

The report presented the\u000d\u000a      case for consolidation of the currently fragmented law, simplification of\u000d\u000a      terminology, and improved regulation of service quality.\u000d\u000a      Elements of the work from the second report were published as part of an\u000d\u000a      analytical piece ((5), written with Deborah Parry).\u000d\u000a    The findings of both reports were accepted by BIS (and its predecessors).\u000d\u000a      Taken together, the underpinning research identifies shortcomings with\u000d\u000a      existing domestic consumer law and suggests how this could be alleviated,\u000d\u000a      whether in response to specific developments at the European level, or by\u000d\u000a      preparing domestic legislation.\u000d\u000a    In addition, Professor Twigg-Flesner has researched into the impact of\u000d\u000a      proposed new EU legislation and its potential impact on UK consumer law\u000d\u000a      ((3) and (4)), in which he argued that the proposed Consumer Rights\u000d\u000a      Directive would be detrimental to consumers.

This has created opportunities for\u000a      direct collaboration with\u000a      users of RP, ranging from internationally-renowned activists to local\u000a      practitioners. This approach\u000a      has helped ensure that Johnstone's research is relevant and accessible to\u000a      key stakeholders, such\u000a      as the Youth Justice Board, the Prison Service, Probation Trusts, and\u000a      Schools.\u000a    These general activities created opportunities for specific\u000a      collaborations with stakeholders and\u000a      users. In 2008 Johnstone entered into a research partnership with the\u000a      Goodwin Development Trust\u000a      with the aim of auditing and evaluating RP in a local context. This\u000a      research and findings would\u000a      underpin a report containing practical guidance for the GDT and other\u000a      organisations wishing to\u000a      implement restorative approaches in the workplace (see source 2). In\u000a      particular, the research\u000a      identified the adverse impact on the use of RP from the absence of an\u000a      effective implementation\u000a      strategy. It also identified the importance of securing RP in workplace\u000a      culture.\u000a    Johnstone initiated a KTP with Hull CC with the specific aim of building\u000a      on the previous findings\u000a      and helping Hull CC measure and improve the use of RP across the City\u000a      (source 3). In particular,\u000a      Johnstone sought to enable `local' practitioners to take advantage of new\u000a      ways of thinking and\u000a      techniques about how to handle conflict and troublesome conduct. The\u000a      research proceeded in\u000a      three stages. Firstly it sought to ensure its relevance by collecting\u000a      local data from various services\u000a      experimenting with RPs and using this to develop a systematic measure of\u000a      `restorativeness' in Hull.\u000a      Secondly, it used ideas from Johnstone's general research and experiences\u000a      of working with other\u000a      users to create a restorative practices database which would (i) help\u000a      practitioners and service\u000a      developers to use RPs appropriately and effectively and (ii) provide tools\u000a      for management\u000a      evaluation of the impact this was having. Thirdly, the research ideas and\u000a      outputs were\u000a      disseminated amongst local users through over a dozen seminars, workshops\u000a      and meetings\u000a      between 2008 and 2010. Key participants and users of the research are\u000a      service providers in\u000a      policing, youth justice and schools over a 2 year period.\u000a    The ultimate beneficiaries of the research are 57,000 children and young\u000a      people (and increasingly\u000a      many adults) in Hull, and professionals working with them. As a result of\u000a      the research and more\u000a      effective use of RP, people in Hull are increasingly using restorative\u000a      language and practices at\u000a      home, in schools and in other settings. Service and business leaders\u000a      report that this is resulting in\u000a      significant reductions in youth offending; reduced truancy,\u000a      improved attitudes in classrooms and\u000a      improvements in educational attainment in Hull; higher levels of\u000a      well-being and happiness, and\u000a      improvement to internal workplace arrangements (the latter documented in\u000a      underpinning research,\u000a      pieces 4 &amp; 5). For example, the business leaders who form the Hull and\u000a      East Yorkshire Bondholder\u000a      scheme link the effective and appropriate use of RPs with outcomes such\u000a      as:\u000a    \u000a      a saving in policing costs, with a RP based system for young offenders\u000a        which cost\u000a        &#163;259,000 to introduce yielding a saving of &#163;3.5 million;\u000a      reduced entrants into the Youth Justice System by twice the national\u000a        average;\u000a      a 23 per cent reduction in custodial sentencing;\u000a      school engagement with difficult students and families at 95 per cent,\u000a        (pre-RP figures were\u000a        0-47 per cent);\u000a      classroom disruptions were reduced by 90 per cent;\u000a      savings of nearly &#163;60,000 per term in supply teaching costs;\u000a      anecdotal evidence of improved relationships and healing of rifts\u000a        between neighbours;\u000a        (see sources 5 &amp; 6)\u000a    \u000a    These benefits have resulted from the guidance on appropriate and\u000a      effective use of restorative\u000a      practices advanced in the research, as informed by robust research into\u000a      international restorative\u000a      justice values and principles, and international standards of service\u000a      delivery.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Hull City Council is deploying Restorative Practices (RPs) to transform\u000a      the lives and experiences of\u000a      children and young people.

Johnstone's work significantly\u000a      shaped the agenda of\u000a      restorative justice studies, in particular by assessing both the\u000a      feasibility and desirability of the\u000a      revolution proposed by the RJM and carefully addressing important\u000a      neglected issues: different\u000a      models of implementing restorative justice in practice; the problems of\u000a      integrating restorative\u000a      interventions with existing criminal justice processes; and the need to\u000a      specify and state carefully\u000a      what restorative justice interventions are designed to achieve and how\u000a      their success might be\u000a      assessed.\u000a    As part of a collaborative research project led by Johnstone and Simon\u000a      Green (Social Sciences,\u000a      Hull University) with Lambert (Research Associate, Goodwin Development\u000a      Trust (GDT)), this\u000a      research was used to analyse the implementation of RPs in a community\u000a      based organisation\u000a      between October 2008 and October 2010. The aim of the project was to study\u000a      the GDTs `journey\u000a      with restorative approaches' and to further understand RP and provide\u000a      recommendations for\u000a      organisations seeking to use and implement RPs. A key finding of the\u000a      research (subsequently\u000a      published: reference 4) was that the GDTs efforts to use RPs in its\u000a      service delivery were frustrated\u000a      by lack of an appropriate implementation strategy, but that they did\u000a      succeed in creating a more\u000a      collaborative workplace in which employees feel involved in decisions\u000a      which affect their work.\u000a    The next phase of the research commenced in October 2010, when Johnstone\u000a      and Green entered\u000a      a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Hull City Council (HCC) (with\u000a      Johnstone as\u000a      academic lead and Green as academic supervisor).

It\u000a      begins by securing recognition of the problem at international and\u000a      domestic levels. This requires the development of compelling case for\u000a      reform, one that is politically, economically and legally feasible. This\u000a      case study shows how research on fisheries regulation conducted at the\u000a      University of Hull has informed high level political discussions and\u000a      shaped governmental attitudes towards the fisheries regulation. It reached\u000a      and informed the views of civil society organisation (CSOs) and has\u000a      contributed to regulatory change.\u000a    Between 2007 and 2009, Barnes participated in the Commonwealth Fisheries\u000a      Programme (CFP). This was designed to shape Commonwealth fisheries policy\u000a      and to promote sustainable fisheries and improve livelihoods of coastal\u000a      communities in developing countries (Source 1). It was sponsored by the UK\u000a      Department for International Development, Australia's AUSAid, the\u000a      Commonwealth Human Ecology Council, and the Commonwealth Policy Studies\u000a      Unit. Central to this programme was a state of the art report on\u000a      sustainable fisheries, compiled by 26 experts in different fields of study\u000a      &#8212; `From Hook to Plate': (Publication 1, Section 3). As a known\u000a      expert on international fisheries law, Barnes was invited to contribute by\u000a      identifying legal impediments to sustainable fisheries regulation in the\u000a      Commonwealth. The research fed into the CFP study tour (2008-9) to a dozen\u000a      developing States with the aim of promoting sustainable fisheries. The\u000a      final research findings provided the case for and basis of options for\u000a      improving the international regulation of fisheries, subsequently taken by\u000a      a number of bodies.\u000a    Barnes' contribution to the Report identified and called for certain\u000a      measures:\u000a    \u000a      participation of all Commonwealth States in key treaties &#8212; the UN\u000a        Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, the UN Fish Stocks Agreement\u000a        1995, and the FAO Compliance Agreement (publication 1, p. 39);\u000a      capacity building to support implementation of the law, including\u000a        tackling IUU fishing (publication 1, p. 40);\u000a      the adoption of alternative regulatory measures (publication 1, p.\u000a        40).\u000a    \u000a    These conclusions informed and influenced the position of numerous CSOs\u000a      (Sources 4 and 5). The Port of Spain Statement 2009, representing the\u000a      views of over 800 CSOs across the Commonwealth called upon the\u000a      Commonwealth member states to endorse the recommendations in the `From\u000a      Hook to Plate' Report. It called for States to commit to strengthening and\u000a      implementing international and regional obligations and mechanisms for the\u000a      protection, conservation and sustainable use of marine resources and\u000a      ecosystems, including systems for data collection on small scale, address\u000a      overfishing, control Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing,\u000a      and abuse of flags of convenience (Source 2, para 49).\u000a    Following the presentation of the report and the Port of Spain Statement,\u000a      the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) Communiqu&#233; 2009 was\u000a      adopted, representing the values and positions of the 49 countries that\u000a      attended the CHOGM (Source 3 below). The communiqu&#233; was influenced by\u000a      Barnes' research and report which raised awareness, shaped political views\u000a      and helped secure recognition of the need for reform and strengthening of\u000a      certain legal commitments (Source 4 below). The 2009 Communiqu&#233; was the\u000a      first to directly address the regulation of fisheries. It specifically\u000a      responds to the issues raised in the research and report, acknowledging\u000a      that \"the unsustainable exploitation of the world's fish stocks posed a\u000a      threat to food security and could lead to long-term economic losses of\u000a      depleted stocks\" (para. 80). The Heads of Government also \"expressed\u000a      concern at the plunder caused by Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated\u000a      Fishing (IUU), in violation of, inter alia, the UN Convention on\u000a      the Law of the Sea and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries\"\u000a      (para. 80). Finally, they \"recognised that many developing states were\u000a      particularly vulnerable to illegal fishing by foreign fleets\" (para 80).\u000a      In light of these problems, as presented in the report, the Heads of\u000a      Government agreed \"that urgent action was needed to strengthen fisheries\u000a      and marine management in member states waters, particularly in the case of\u000a      the more vulnerable member states.\" These issues remain on the\u000a      Commonwealth policy agenda and were reiterated in the Perth Declaration on\u000a      Food Security adopted at the CHOGM in 2011. (Source 5 paras 7, 11, and\u000a      14).\u000a    Since the project started, a number of Commonwealth states have adopted\u000a      measures to tackle IUU fishing. In 2009 Mozambique adopted a National Plan\u000a      of Action to address IUU fishing. (Source 6). As influenced by the\u000a      research, the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism adopted the Castries\u000a      Declaration on IUU Fishing on 28 July 2010 (Source 7, 8).

It represented the cementing of a\u000d\u000a      pioneering research partnership, affording exceptional research access&#8212;and\u000d\u000a      influence&#8212;of a kind that CPS has rarely granted to external researchers.\u000d\u000a      Although the primary research partner\/stakeholder was CPS itself,\u000d\u000a      improvements in the quality of criminal prosecutions benefit all\u000d\u000a      concerned. Complainants should be treated more sensitively. Cases are\u000d\u000a      strengthened, improving outcomes; or discontinued more efficiently, saving\u000d\u000a      resources and sparing suspects from unnecessarily prolonged official\u000d\u000a      scrutiny or detention[i, ii, viii]. The ultimate beneficiary is society at\u000d\u000a      large, in terms of criminal proceedings better able to secure justice. In\u000d\u000a      the words of the Director of Public Prosecutions:\u000d\u000a    \"Pre-trial witness interviews represent a fundamental change to our legal\u000d\u000a      system as prosecutors were not allowed to interview witnesses in any cases\u000d\u000a      in England and Wales before these CPS pilots began. I consider witness\u000d\u000a      interviews to be an essential tool to help prosecutors to make better\u000d\u000a      informed decisions about criminal cases so that the right person is\u000d\u000a      brought before the right court for the right offence\"[iii].\u000d\u000a    Independent external research was regarded by CPS as a precondition of\u000d\u000a      national roll-out, and was therefore instrumental in promoting each of\u000d\u000a      these positive outcomes. As the CPS Policy Team Leader with responsibility\u000d\u000a      (at that time) for PTWI confirms: \"[T]he evaluation process, incorporating\u000d\u000a      your socio-legal study, was of considerable assistance to the prosecutors\u000d\u000a      in the pilot areas and assisted me in informing the content of guidance\u000d\u000a      and training that we provided and continue to provide. I think it also\u000d\u000a      fair to say that the contents and conclusions of your summary report\u000d\u000a      contributed to the decision to roll it out in the first place.... [Y]our\u000d\u000a      research was useful to CPS in developing this significant initiative in\u000d\u000a      prosecutorial practice\"[vi].\u000d\u000a    The published research findings and analysis, in conjunction with\u000d\u000a      informal advice to CPS, have continued to contribute to the further\u000d\u000a      refinement and implementation of PTWI on a rolling basis:\u000d\u000a    (1) Following completion of the PTWI Pilot and its evaluation\u000d\u000a        (centrally featuring Roberts and Saunders' socio-legal research), the\u000d\u000a        decision to implement PTWI nationally was announced in 2007\u000d\u000a      (Statement of Baroness Scotland, Attorney-General, HL Deb 27 Nov 2007, vol\u000d\u000a      696 cols 142-143WS; Statement of Vera Baird MP, Solicitor-General, HC Deb\u000d\u000a      27 Nov 2007, vol 468 col 24WS). PTWI was successfully rolled-out to all 42\u000d\u000a      CPS Areas in England and Wales in April 2008. A CPS press release stated:\u000d\u000a      \"The initiative was trialled in four CPS areas from January to December\u000d\u000a      2006, on the basis of which a decision was made to roll out the initiative\u000d\u000a      throughout England and Wales\"[iii]. The CPS Annual Report for\u000d\u000a      2007-2008 elucidated:\u000d\u000a    \"Between January 2006 and January 2007, the pre-trial witness interview\u000d\u000a      (PTWI) scheme was successfully piloted in four CPS Areas.... Following the\u000d\u000a      pilot, the four CPS Areas have continued to undertake PTWIs &#8212; by January\u000d\u000a      2008 over 90 interviews had been conducted, predominantly in serious\u000d\u000a      cases. An external evaluation concluded that the scheme improved\u000d\u000a        prosecutorial decision-making by strengthening cases which went to trial\u000d\u000a        and rejecting potentially weak cases at an early stage. National\u000d\u000a      implementation was achieved on time in April 2008 and around 180\u000d\u000a      prosecutors have been trained to undertake PTWIs\".[iv, emphasis supplied]\u000d\u000a    Many informed observers were initially sceptical or hostile to the\u000d\u000a      introduction of PTWI[v]. Crucially, the Pilot Evaluation research drew\u000d\u000a      attention to risks and potential shortcoming which would require on-going\u000d\u000a      monitoring and effective management to ensure the success of national\u000d\u000a      roll-out.\u000d\u000a    Building on the influence of the research in helping to pave the way for\u000d\u000a      PTWI's national roll-out, the principal on-going impacts of the research\u000d\u000a      post roll-out (April 2008 onwards) are attributable to:\u000d\u000a    (2) The experience gained by Pilot prosecutors who participated in the\u000d\u000a        \"training days\", and subsequently became PTWI \"champions\", extolling\u000d\u000a      the benefits of PTWI and passing on tips to their front-line colleagues.\u000d\u000a      The \"training days\", devised and run by Roberts, were organised around\u000d\u000a      presentations, by Roberts, of provisional results of the socio-legal\u000d\u000a      study, which were debated at length by prosecutors (and the research\u000d\u000a      findings augmented accordingly). Pilot prosecutors said that these\u000d\u000a      sessions were invaluable opportunities to pool experiences, and that there\u000d\u000a      was no substitute for face-to-face instruction and discussion, e.g. one\u000d\u000a      prosecutor emphasised the indispensability of \"[a]wareness training...\u000d\u000a      informing lawyers in a lecture or seminar scenario. Whilst lawyers have\u000d\u000a      memos and written guidance, they are less likely to read and digest\u000d\u000a      information, as they have other pressing concerns. A course, however,\u000d\u000a      ensures they are made aware\". The study's \"training days\"\/focus groups are\u000d\u000a      regarded by CPS as having made an on-going, long term contribution to the\u000d\u000a      development, practical implementation and refinement of PTWI: \"[A] useful,\u000d\u000a      possibly overlooked, aspect of your evaluation report was that you brought\u000d\u000a      together a lot of scenarios and views in one document, which made it\u000d\u000a      easier to pick through and discuss potential pitfalls in the pilot\u000d\u000a      evaluation meetings and later in the training sessions\" [vi].\u000d\u000a    (3) On-going influence on CPS operational policy guidance. CPS\u000d\u000a      internal documentation and operational guidance on conducting pre-trial\u000d\u000a      interviews was systematically revised in the light of the Pilot: see http:\/\/www.cps.gov.uk\/legal\/p_to_r\/pre_-trial_witness_interviews\/.\u000d\u000a      In particular, the summary research report written by Roberts and Saunders\u000d\u000a      [i] was hosted on the CPS website from January 2008 to mid-2013, and\u000d\u000a      during this time formed part of the operational resources provided to\u000d\u000a      front-line Crown Prosecutors in considering and conducting pre-trial\u000d\u000a      interviews.\u000d\u000a    PTWI continues to figure in developments of CPS operational policy, e.g.\u000d\u000a      in revised guidance for prosecutors in relation to rape and sexual\u000d\u000a      offences, which now states: \"The use of pre-trial witness interviews\u000d\u000a      (PTWI) is considered an effective tool in rape cases. This will\u000d\u000a      particularly apply in cases where the decision to prosecute is\u000d\u000a      'borderline'. In June 2009... the DPP instructed that prosecutors should,\u000d\u000a      as part of their decision-making in every rape case, consider whether or\u000d\u000a      not a PTWI is appropriate and provide reasons for their decision... This\u000d\u000a      instruction remains in force and should be followed in every case\"[vii].\u000d\u000a      This echoes our research finding of \"several striking illustrations in the\u000d\u000a      Pilot cases in which convictions were achieved that probably could not\u000d\u000a      have been secured without the benefit of a pre-trial witness interview\"\u000d\u000a      (viii, p.7).\u000d\u000a    (4) International policy transfer: Dissemination of research\u000d\u000a      findings is still on-going, especially in terms of international\u000d\u000a      impact[ix]. There has been interest from senior prosecutors and\u000d\u000a      policy-makers overseas, e.g. Hong Kong[x], in examining English\u000d\u000a      experiences of PTWI.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This research informed the introduction and on-going implementation of a\u000d\u000a      major criminal policy innovation, namely, Pre-Trial Witness Interviewing\u000d\u000a      (PTWI) by Crown Prosecutors across England and Wales.

This\u000d\u000a      restriction (absent in many other common law jurisdictions) increasingly\u000d\u000a      came to be viewed as contrary to the interests of justice, as highlighted,\u000d\u000a      e.g., in public criticism of the CPS following the collapse of the first\u000d\u000a      Damilola Taylor murder trial. PTWI is a revolutionary development in\u000d\u000a      English criminal procedure, enabling prosecutors to interview key\u000d\u000a      witnesses at an early stage in the process for the purposes of improving\u000d\u000a      their decision-making in relation to charge selection, discontinuance and\u000d\u000a      case preparation for trial. PTWI may also ameliorate complainants'\u000d\u000a      experiences of criminal proceedings and assist witnesses to give their\u000d\u000a      best evidence in court.\u000d\u000a    In order to test and fine-tune the policy, CPS conducted a \"live case\"\u000d\u000a      Pilot of PTWI between January 2006 and April 2007. Extending previous\u000d\u000a      successful research collaborations in relation to special measures for\u000d\u000a      vulnerable and intimidated witnesses[1], [2], CPS engaged Professor\u000d\u000a        Paul Roberts as a consultant to devise and conduct an independent\u000d\u000a      socio-legal evaluation of PTWI in action during the Pilot phase. This\u000d\u000a      project was designed to ascertain (in conjunction with other monitoring\u000d\u000a      activities undertaken by CPS) whether, and to what extent, Pilot\u000d\u000a      interviews achieved their stated objectives, and to identify areas of best\u000d\u000a      practice and issues for further practical consideration [3], [4]. A\u000d\u000a      qualitative socio-legal methodology was developed by Roberts, in\u000d\u000a      discussion with CPS Policy Directorate, to investigate the dynamics of\u000d\u000a      prosecutors' decision-making in relation to (i) case-selection; (ii)\u000d\u000a      interviewing strategy; (iii) interactions with other agencies (police;\u000d\u000a      counsel); and, crucially, (iv) the impact of PTWI interviewing on case\u000d\u000a      progression (decisions to charge, discontinue, secure further evidence, or\u000d\u000a      prosecute to trial)[5].\u000d\u000a    CPS granted Roberts unparalleled access to the 20 or so Crown Prosecutors\u000d\u000a      selected and trained to conduct Pilot interviews, and also to CPS' own\u000d\u000a      monitoring data on the 93 Pilot cases in which PTWI was considered.\u000d\u000a      Sixteen in-depth, semi-structured qualitative research interviews were\u000d\u000a      conducted by Roberts or his then doctoral student and research assistant,\u000d\u000a      Candida Saunders, with Crown Prosecutors and Chief Crown\u000d\u000a      Prosecutors in the four CPS Pilot Areas. In addition, Roberts organised\u000d\u000a      and led three \"training days\" (run as large focus and discussion groups)\u000d\u000a      with these and other PTWI prosecutors in May 2006 and January 2007, which\u000d\u000a      also provided supplementary research data.\u000d\u000a    A comprehensive final report (c.110,000 words), detailing the research\u000d\u000a      findings and containing twenty-two specific recommendations for further\u000d\u000a      consideration, was presented to CPS Policy Directorate in April 2007. A\u000d\u000a      heavily abbreviated summary was published by CPS on its website in early\u000d\u000a      2008 [3], and this document formed part of the guidance provided to Crown\u000d\u000a      Prosecutors in PTWI's crucial formative years following national roll-out\u000d\u000a      in April 2008.\u000d\u000a    In brief, the research demonstrated empirically that PTWI could in\u000d\u000a      principle achieve its stated aims of improving prosecutorial\u000d\u000a      decision-making, promoting effective prosecutions and helping complainants\u000d\u000a      and other witnesses in the interests of justice.

Specifically, his research contributed to strengthening the\u000a      UN's institutional architecture for human rights monitoring and\u000a      protection. Its success in this regard can be measured in terms of its\u000a      pivotal influence in initiating, informing and guiding the most ambitious\u000a      set of reform initiatives ever seen in the life of the treaty body system.\u000a      The beneficiaries of the institutional reforms promoted and facilitated by\u000a      O'Flaherty's research are the human rights treaty bodies themselves,\u000a      states that engage with the human rights bodies (e.g. through submission\u000a      of state party reports), civil society, and the individuals whose human\u000a      rights are better protected.\u000a    In 2009, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (the principal UN\u000a      official with responsibility for support to the treaty body system)\u000a      indicated the need for systematic reconsideration of measures to\u000a      strengthen the treaty body system. In response to that appeal, in\u000a      September 2009, O'Flaherty initiated a reflection process on reform of the\u000a      treaty body system, with the participation of treaty body members acting\u000a      in their personal capacity. As part of this reflection process, O'Flaherty\u000a      drafted a programme for a reform process, drawing extensively on his\u000a      academic work. In particular, the draft programme reflected the\u000a      institutional history of reform processes as laid out in [4] and employed\u000a      many of the concepts elucidated in [4], [5] and [6]. The programme was\u000a      examined by a committee of experts at a meeting in Dublin in November 2009\u000a      attended by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. At that meeting,\u000a      the Dublin Statement on the Strengthening of the UN Human Rights Treaty\u000a      Body System was adopted, which was a refined version of O'Flaherty's own\u000a      original draft.\u000a    The University of Nottingham has been explicitly credited for\u000a      facilitating the Dublin process and producing the Dublin Statement. For\u000a      example, the UN Secretary-General has noted that:\u000a    \"A number of consultations organized by stakeholders as a direct response\u000a      to the High Commissioner's call have taken place and resulted in the\u000a      adoption of statements which include various proposals to strengthen and\u000a      streamline the treaty body system. These meetings were organized in Dublin\u000a      in November 2009, for treaty body members, at the initiative of the\u000a      University of Nottingham, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\u000a      Ireland.\" [i]\u000a\u0009The Dublin Statement was subsequently debated and built upon\u000a      by all of the key global stakeholder groups (including states, civil\u000a      society, national human rights institutions, and UN officials) at a series\u000a      of meetings held in 2010 and 2011 in Switzerland, South Korea, South\u000a      Africa, Morocco, Poland and elsewhere. O'Flaherty was a participant at the\u000a      key meetings, which adopted statements on treaty body reform at their\u000a      conclusion [ii]. These statements also follow O'Flaherty's reform\u000a      proposals. For example, O'Flaherty's recommendation that state party\u000a      reports must involve broad consultation with all relevant stakeholders and\u000a      the need to encourage better participation of non-governmental\u000a      organizations and national human rights institutions [1] was adopted by\u000a      the Pretoria statement (2.10 and 3.3); the Sion statement (page 10); the\u000a      Poznan statement (paras 13-15) and the Seoul statement (sections 3(a) and\u000a      (b) and 4) [ii]. His advocacy for consolidation and integration of treaty\u000a      body recommendations into the broader human rights work of the UN [5] is\u000a      reflected in the Pretoria statement (10(2)(a)), which recommended that\u000a      \"[t]here should be better integration of the outputs of treaty bodies into\u000a      the work of OHCHR, especially through its regional offices\", and the\u000a      Poznan statement (para 4) [ii]. O'Flaherty's suggestion that certain\u000a      concluding observations be prioritised is reflected in the Pretoria\u000a      statement, which recommended that `[t]reaty bodies should consider\u000a      classifying Concluding Observations into short, medium and long-term\u000a      categories to aid in their implementation\" (9.3) [ii]. More generally,\u000a      according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, \"[t]he Dublin\u000a      Statement, adopted in November 2009, which was endorsed by many treaty\u000a      body experts, paved the way for the current treaty body strengthening\u000a      process\" [iii].\u000a    Subsequent to this series of meetings, in 2011 O'Flaherty was requested\u000a      by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene a culminating\u000a      meeting, also held in Dublin, to draw together the findings of the\u000a      reflection process. O'Flaherty drafted an outcome document for the Dublin\u000a      meeting, once again drawing heavily on his own research and publications.\u000a      Those adopted proposals contained in the original Dublin Statement were\u000a      carried over into the final Outcome Document. Additional examples of the\u000a      Dublin Process drawing directly on O'Flaherty's distinctive contributions\u000a      to the scholarly and practitioner literature include calls for further\u000a      reflection on the relationship between the treaty bodies and the Human\u000a      Rights Council [4], composition of treaty body membership [3] and better\u000a      integration of follow up procedures and enforcement measures [5].\u000a    A group of experts, including the chairs of almost all of the UN human\u000a      rights treaty bodies and senior UN officials, met in Dublin in November\u000a      2011, under O'Flaherty's chairmanship, where they adopted the \"Dublin\u000a      Outcome Document' of what had by then become known as the \"Dublin Process\"\u000a      [iv].\u000a    The Dublin Outcome Document &#8212; dubbed \"Dublin II\" &#8212; has been endorsed by\u000a      UN human rights treaty bodies including the UN Committee on Enforced\u000a      Disappearances [v] and the UN Human Rights Committee. The latter has\u000a      stated publicly that \"it is important to engage in this [reform] process\u000a      and adopt a view on the main issues\/proposals that have arisen to date, in\u000a      particular as set out in the Dublin II Outcome document\" [vi]. The UN High\u000a      Commissioner for Human Rights published her report on treaty body reform\u000a      in June 2012 and drew heavily from the Dublin II outcome document and\u000a      explicitly credited the Dublin Process and the work of the University of\u000a      Nottingham [vii].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Sustained published research in the area of UN human rights treaty body\u000a      reform has positioned O'Flaherty as the principal international specialist\u000a      in the area.

It is intended to monitor and support States for\u000a      the effective implementation at the national level of their treaty-based\u000a      human rights obligations.\u000a    The System has been in a state of escalating crisis over the last 20\u000a      years. The many dimensions of the crisis may be categorised in terms of\u000a      five challenges: input, analysis, output, impact\u000a      and environment. Issues of input include the problem of\u000a      under-reporting by States, that is failing to report when their reports\u000a      are due, and limited engagement in the process on the part of civil\u000a      society. Analysis is challenged by the very poor systems of\u000a      secretariat support and research services afforded to the treaty bodies\u000a      and the limited time available for consideration of country situations by\u000a      the treaty body expert members. The ultimate output challenge is\u000a      the fact that findings of treaty bodies are non-binding in nature. The impact\u000a      dimension of the crisis relates to the findings being constrained by such\u000a      factors as the lack of effective follow up procedures of the treaty\u000a      bodies. Environmental challenges relate to the emergence of new,\u000a      potentially \"competing\" oversight mechanisms, especially the UN Human\u000a      Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review procedure.\u000a    There have been numerous attempts at a reform of the system stretching\u000a      over many years, yet with only very limited success. Professor Michael\u000a      O'Flaherty's sustained research at the University of Nottingham, between 1\u000a      January 2004 and 31 January 2013, clarified key understandings of the\u000a      system and made concrete reform proposals relating, e.g., to its\u000a      multi-stakeholder dimensions; the need to acknowledge both legal and\u000a      diplomatic dimensions; the nature of the principal treaty body outputs\u000a      (\"concluding observations\"); reform of the periodic reporting procedures;\u000a      and the delivery of human rights impact on the ground. For instance,\u000a      O'Flaherty is the author of the leading academic work devoted to legal\u000a      analysis of \"concluding observations\" [6], in which a new conceptual\u000a      taxonomy is advanced. His published work also advocated the consolidation\u000a      and integration of treaty body recommendations into the broader human\u000a      rights work of the UN [5] and the greater involvement of non-governmental\u000a      organizations and national human rights institutions in the reporting\u000a      process [1]. More generally, O'Flaherty's published research identified\u000a      the need to recognize the treaty bodies as diplomatic actors [3],\u000a      critically evaluated past reform efforts and proposed effective reform\u000a      strategies. His principal publication on this theme, co-authored with\u000a      O'Brien [4], remains one of the most cited articles ever published in the\u000a      Human Rights Law Review. The authors argued for a reform process\u000a      that preserves the various functions of the treaty body system, avoids\u000a      marginalising particular categories of human rights and learns from\u000a      lessons of past (largely unsuccessful) reform efforts. Much of this agenda\u000a      came to be adopted by the Dublin Process and is clearly reflected in its\u000a      official outputs and achievements (see below, Section 4).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32983","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1220409","Name":"Tajikistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3573591","Name":"Trinidad and Tobago"},{"GeoNamesId":"933860","Name":"Botswana"},{"GeoNamesId":"878675","Name":"Zimbabwe"},{"GeoNamesId":"934292","Name":"Mauritius"},{"GeoNamesId":"2029969","Name":"Mongolia"},{"GeoNamesId":"174982","Name":"Armenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research had a significant impact on the 2011 Model Law on Public\u000a      Procurement of UNCITRAL, &#8212; a substantially revised version of the 1994\u000a      Model Law.\u000a    UNCITRAL is a UN agency concerned with trade. Inter alia, it adopts\u000a      `model' laws on commercial matters for use in national laws: governments\u000a      simply copy the UNCITRAL text (suitably adapted) into national\u000a      legislation. The model laws' purpose is to help states adopt sound\u000a      regulatory frameworks without unnecessary effort, whilst also promoting\u000a      standardised rules to assist trade (since companies find it easier to\u000a      operate abroad if the legal framework is familiar).\u000a    The Model Law on procurement deals with regulatory rules on public\u000a      procurement &#8212; that is, the acquisition of goods, works and services by\u000a      governments (from simple items such as furniture to complex infrastructure\u000a      such as power stations). A sound regulatory framework is considered\u000a      important to avoid wasting resources; ensure high-quality infrastructure;\u000a      secure adequate services in areas such as transport and health; and fight\u000a      corruption. Procurement is also a vehicle to achieve other policies, such\u000a      as reducing environmental damage, promoting competitive markets and\u000a      encouraging e-commerce. UNCITRAL's Model Law on procurement provides a\u000a      template that aims to help states to achieve and balance these objectives\u000a      whilst also facilitating trade. Intended ultimate beneficiaries are those\u000a      affected by the above interests including governments; taxpayers; citizens\u000a      and businesses using government services; suppliers, including those in\u000a      international markets and small businesses; and beneficiaries of social\u000a      programmes implemented through procurement (such as minority groups).\u000a    In 2003 UNCITRAL launched a review of the 1994 Model Law to: i) adapt it\u000a      to new practical and technological phenomena; and ii) improve its existing\u000a      rules. The resulting new Model Law was adopted in July 2011. New phenomena\u000a      addressed include matters essential for an effective modern purchasing\u000a      system, in particular e-procurement &#8212; including electronic auctions &#8212; and\u000a      framework agreements (sophisticated methods for procuring repeat needs,\u000a      such as maintenance and consultancy). Arrowsmith's research as described\u000a      in section 2 above substantially influenced the 2011 Model by analysing\u000a      precisely both which issues to address and how to address\u000a      them. As stated by the UNCITRAL Secretariat in item 5\/3 (which confirms\u000a      the statements below): \"..... [the] short description of her work\u000a        [below] does not do justice to the very significant influence that her\u000a        research has had on both the initial choice of issues for reform and in\u000a        the nature and quality of the final outputs\". Arrowsmith was also\u000a      appointed a member of UNCITRAL's Experts Committee on procurement,\u000a      responsible for advising the UNCITRAL Secretariat throughout the reform\u000a      process (2003-2011).\u000a    More specifically, the 2011 Model includes:\u000a    i) Extensive provisions on the \"new\" areas analysed by Arrowsmith\u000a      in items 3\/2, 3\/3, 3\/4 and 3\/5.\u000a    As recommended in these items, the Model authorises broad use of new\u000a      mechanisms (see item 5\/2). These are found in Article 7\u000a      (e-communications), Articles 53-57 (electronic reverse auctions), and\u000a      Articles 58-63 (framework agreements, authorising certain categories of\u000a      framework agreements, but not others, as per recommendations in item 3\/5).\u000a      The templates developed in Arrowsmith in research items 3\/2, 3\/3, and 3\/5\u000a      &#8212; based on her analysis of the complex practical phenomena involved and\u000a      her comparative research into regulation and practice &#8212; formed the basis\u000a      of the Secretariat's presentation of these novel issues to the Working\u000a      Group, to ensure the Group's understanding of the practical situations,\u000a      policy options and regulatory distinctions: see items 5\/3 and 5\/4. As the\u000a      Secretariat states in item 5\/3:\u000a    \"[Item 3\/5] was particularly significant in dealing with those areas\u000a        such as electronic communications, electronic auctions and framework\u000a        agreements in which very few states had actually adopted regulatory\u000a        rules. Without Professor Arrowsmith's research in carefully classifying\u000a        the variations in the phenomena to be regulated, identifying the issues\u000a        for regulators, and explaining the options to address them, it would\u000a        have been impossible for the Secretariat to draft comprehensive material\u000a        for consideration by the Working Group...; for the Working Group to\u000a        engage in focused discussion; and for the Group and the Secretariat to\u000a        produce the final high- quality text that was adopted by the Commission\u000a        in 2011.....the contents of the Model Law reflect many of the specific\u000a        recommendations made in the papers, both on matters of principle and\u000a        matters of regulatory detail\".\u000a    The above Articles of the 2011 Model Law also include numerous controls\u000a      and other detail on the new mechanisms, based on recommendations in items\u000a      3\/4, 3\/5 and 3\/6. A couple of examples (amongst many) are inclusion of\u000a      specific controls over communications which, as recommended, do not\u000a      explicitly distinguish between electronic and other means (Article\u000a      7(4)-(5)); and regular publication of aggregate information on awards\u000a      under frameworks (Article 23) (not found in existing regulatory systems\u000a      but recommended in the above work to fill a gap in transparency).\u000a    ii) Reforms on other areas, as specifically recommended or identified\u000a        for consideration, in items 3\/4, 3\/5 and 3\/6 (see item 5\/2 for\u000a      corroboration). A few examples are: a standard approach to services and\u000a      goods\/works, instead of provision of different procurement methods\u000a      specifically for goods\/works, on the one hand, and services on the other\u000a      (Articles 27 and 28(1)); explicit provision for social and environmental\u000a      award criteria (previously absent) but accompanied, as recommended by\u000a      Arrowsmith, by control through specific authorisation in national\u000a      regulations (Article 11); removal of previous exclusions from supplier\u000a      review (exclusion existing in the 1994 version are no longer found in the\u000a      2011 version); and new provision for an independent body to review\u000a      supplier complaints in all systems.\u000a    The Model Law is an international regulatory model of global relevance,\u000a      designed for use in any country (with options within it to take account of\u000a      differing national conditions). To give just a few examples, the 2011\u000a      Model has already been used:\u000a    \u000a      by Mauritius in enacting its latest revisions to the Public\u000a        Procurement Law 2006 (2010-2011) (these were based on the draft 2011\u000a        Model Law): see http:\/\/ppo.gov.mu\/Englis\/documents\/ppo2006.pdf e.g. s.2 definition of \"framework agreement\" and s.29, introducing\u000a        provision for frameworks for the first time, based on the 2011 Model Law\u000a      as the basis of the Bill currently before Parliament for the first\u000a        comprehensive procurement law in India (see the first draft by Planning\u000a        Commission of India, preface, s.6 stating \"The Public Procurement Bill\u000a        2011 draws substantially from the UNCITRAL Model Law of July 2011\" (http:\/\/infrastructure.gov.in\/pdf\/public-procurment-bill.pdf))\u000a        and the final Bill \u000ahttp:\/\/164.100.24.219\/BillsTexts\/LSBillTexts\/asintroduced\/58_2012_LS_EN.pdf\u000a        (which is modelled on the 2011 version of UNCITRAL in most of its rules,\u000a        and includes electronic auctions as added by the 2011 Model Law);\u000a      for an UNCITRAL-EBRD joint reform project for the Commonwealth of\u000a        Independent States and Mongolia (see generally www.ppi-ebrd-uncitral.com\/index.php\/en\/the-initiative).\u000a        The UNCITRAL Secretariat has already commented on draft legislation\u000a        prepared by the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, and legislative\u000a        revisions are currently being drafted by Armenia with the Secretariat's\u000a        assistance (item 5\/6)\u000a      to draft reform proposals for the Public Procurement Law of Ghana\u000a        (currently based on the 1994 Model), including to add new provisions on\u000a        remedies and social\/environmental issues from the 2011 Model and\u000a        introduce measures on e-procurement and frameworks (currently before the\u000a        Cabinet in a Cabinet Memorandum): see item 5\/5.\u000a      to draft legislation for several Caribbean countries e.g. new\u000a        legislation based on the Model Law is before the Legislative Review\u000a        Committee of Trinidad and Tobago for 19 Aug 2013: for details of this\u000a        and other Caribbean reforms see corroborating item 5\/6.\u000a      The 2011 Model is also being used by OECD in revising its methodology\u000a        for assessing systems for development aid, and in assessing compliance\u000a        with Art.9 of UN Convention on Corruption: item 5\/6.\u000a    \u000a    Given that the 2011 Model Law referred to here was only adopted two years\u000a      ago and the length of legislative processes, it is too soon for the\u000a      changes to the Model Law to be reflected even more extensively in national\u000a      legislation. However, its inherent importance can be gauged from the fact\u000a      that the 1994 Model Law was used as the main basis for procurement\u000a      legislation of more than 30 countries (para.226 in item 5\/1 below) and to\u000a      some degree in many more (e.g. in Africa in Botswana and Zimbabwe). Use of\u000a      the Model Law's provisions is a World Bank requirement for Bank-funded\u000a      reform of states' own procurement systems (World Bank, Note for\u000a        drafting public procurement regulations (March 2002)); this means\u000a      that although it is not legally binding on states, developing countries\u000a      are often effectively required to use it given that the World Bank\u000a      provides or contributes to procurement reform programmes. The 2011 Model\u000a      is likely to be similarly influential.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Sue Arrowsmith's research significantly influenced UNCITRAL's\u000a      revised 2011 Model Law on Public Procurement.

Arrowsmith's\u000a      extensive works on procurement regulation have included assessing the 1994\u000a      Model Law in comparison with other systems: item 3\/1 below. Hers was the\u000a      first work to examine procurement regulation from a principled and\u000a      comparative perspective and is cited by many authors on specific systems\u000a      (e.g. Quinot (South Africa)) as well as in later general\/comparative works\u000a      (e.g. Gordon; Evenett &amp; Hoekman). From 2000 she published on new\u000a      practices, notably e-procurement (including electronic auctions) and\u000a      framework agreements. This work analysed how these phenomena might be\u000a      regulated in EU law, but was done prior to actual legislation in the EU or\u000a      elsewhere, and focused on developing analytical templates and identifying\u000a      possible regulatory approaches that are of global relevance for addressing\u000a      these new phenomena through legal rules: see items 3\/2 and 3\/1. The\u000a      utility and broad relevance of these templates and associated\u000a      recommendations is shown, for example, by the fact that the templates\u000a      developed in item 3\/3 were used by Prof Yukins (Professor of Law, member\u000a      of UNCITRAL Experts Group and adviser to the US delegation at the Working\u000a      Group meetings) in published work analysing the US and UNCITRAL systems\u000a      prior to the UNCITRAL reforms (see item 5\/4 below, which evidences\u000a      research quality as well as impact on the UNCITRAL reform process of\u000a      2003-11).\u000a    This work led to UNCITRAL approaching Arrowsmith in 2003 for a paper\u000a      proposing reforms to the Model Law, which would draw on her research on\u000a      how to regulate the new practices (see item 3\/4). As stated by the\u000a      UNCITRAL Secretariat in item 5\/4: \"she was selected for this request on\u000a        the basis of the breadth and quality of her published work on\u000a        procurement regulation, including her innovative work on how to regulate\u000a        new areas of procurement practice ...which were only just coming to the\u000a        attention of regulators\". The resulting paper formed the direct\u000a      basis of the material presented by the Secretariat to UNCITRAL, which was\u000a      then adopted as the basis of a formal review of the Model Law (see item\u000a      5\/1). Contemporaneously, Arrowsmith published in the world's leading\u000a      comparative law journal explaining her recommendations in light of her\u000a      conception of the role and nature of the Model Law (item 3\/6).\u000a    UNCITRAL then asked her to develop a further paper detailing precise\u000a      options and recommendations for reform (see item 3\/5). This drew on her\u000a      earlier analytical templates: in many areas these provided the foundations\u000a      for a comparative study, allowing diverse national practical approaches\u000a      and legal concepts to be analysed within a common framework, and also\u000a      provided a basis for outlining regulatory options.\u000a    At all relevant times, Arrowsmith was (and is) Professor in the School of\u000a      Law.\u000a    Citations of item 3\/1 referred to above: Quinot, State Commercial\u000a        Activity: A Legal Framework (2008) Juta &amp; Co: Cape Town e.g. pp\u000a      12, 40, 220, 252, 269; Gordon, 35 Pub.

It was tasked with reviewing the Office for\u000d\u000a      Criminal Justice Reform proposals and creating a template from which\u000d\u000a      educational guidance designed for dissemination to jurors in rape trials\u000d\u000a      could be developed. Whilst this work was ongoing, the Court of Appeal\u000d\u000a      approved an expansive judicial direction that sought to dispel juror myths\u000d\u000a      in relation to &#8212; amongst other things &#8212; the relevance of delayed rape\u000d\u000a      reporting. In light of this, and in a context in which the Office for\u000d\u000a      Criminal Justice Reform's proposals to make greater use of expert evidence\u000d\u000a      had been met with reluctance by some legal professionals, the\u000d\u000a      Solicitor-General raised the question of whether judicial instructions\u000d\u000a      would provide a more appropriate medium. The emerging (and subsequently\u000d\u000a      published) findings of our ESRC study confirmed that judicial instruction\u000d\u000a      could have a positive impact, and were influential in the\u000d\u000a      Solicitor-General's decision to support their development by judges. As\u000d\u000a      the Solicitor-General notes:\u000d\u000a    \"The panel and I benefitted from the findings of this research as it\u000d\u000a      unfolded, which not only highlighted the existence of misconceptions about\u000d\u000a      rape amongst the public, but also, crucially, confirmed the positive\u000d\u000a      corrective influence of educational guidance on juror decision-making.\u000d\u000a      This in turn played a key role in framing the recommendations of the panel\u000d\u000a      to introduce a form of educational guidance to counter juror\u000d\u000a      stereotypes.....

It is extremely rare for academics to be\u000d\u000a      invited to present on their own research in this forum. In 2010, the JSB\u000d\u000a      issued revised guidance to judges, which now includes a series of extended\u000d\u000a      directions designed to counter dubious myths and expectations on the part\u000d\u000a      of jurors in rape cases. Our research is directly cited in support of the\u000d\u000a      appropriateness of this approach in the Crown Court Benchbook (Source C).\u000d\u000a      Moreover, the influence and value of our research in this regard has been\u000d\u000a      confirmed by the Solicitor-General [\"The research has subsequently also\u000d\u000a      influenced the development of dedicated judicial directions that judges\u000d\u000a      are encouraged (and frequently do now) use in rape cases, which were\u000d\u000a      issued by the Judicial Studies Board\" &#8212; Source A] and Judge Peter Rook,\u000d\u000a      QC, Senior Circuit Judge at the Old Bailey who, from 2006-2011, was\u000d\u000a      responsible for organising compulsory Judicial Studies Board Training on\u000d\u000a      Serious Sexual Offences, and played a key role in developing the judicial\u000d\u000a      directions [\"I started to provide judges with draft directions.

Their\u000d\u000a      use remains optional, but the recognition that they afford to the need\u000d\u000a      for, and value of, `myth-busting' guidance is of considerable importance,\u000d\u000a      and members of the senior judiciary have confirmed that they are\u000d\u000a      frequently utilised. These directions may change the overall tenor of the\u000d\u000a      rape trial, alter the ways in which jurors go about their deliberative\u000d\u000a      task, and ultimately ensure greater justice.

In some jurisdictions where the jury play a central role in\u000d\u000a      determining liability, prosecutors have introduced evidence to `educate'\u000d\u000a      jurors on the reactions of rape victims. In 2006, the Office for Criminal\u000d\u000a      Justice Reform proposed something similar in England and Wales. This was\u000d\u000a      based on two assumptions: (i) that certain complainant behaviours\u000d\u000a      (including courtroom demeanour, delayed reporting and failure to resist)\u000d\u000a      adversely impact upon jurors' perceptions; and (ii) that expert testimony\u000d\u000a      could educate jurors' understandings.\u000d\u000a    An ESRC funded project, conducted jointly by Louise Ellison (Leeds) and\u000d\u000a      Vanessa Munro (since September 2007, Professor of Socio-Legal Studies at\u000d\u000a      the University of Nottingham), sought to test these assumptions, and to\u000d\u000a      consider whether providing guidance via judicial instruction rather than\u000d\u000a      expert testimony would offer an equally &#8212; if not more &#8212; effective\u000d\u000a      alternative. The research used a method that Munro had developed in a\u000d\u000a      previous study exploring the impact on jurors of a rape complainant's\u000d\u000a      intoxication. Both investigators had published extensively on sexual\u000d\u000a      violence and rape prosecution: Munro specialising on social attitudes and\u000d\u000a      critique of consent, and Ellison specialising on evidential and\u000d\u000a      prosecutorial dimensions. Several articles have resulted, but articles (a)\u000d\u000a      and (b) below are the most relevant to its impact.\u000d\u000a    Article (a) examines the extent to which the jury-service eligible\u000d\u000a      members of the public, recruited to participate in the study, were\u000d\u000a      influenced by the complainant behaviours noted above. Our findings\u000d\u000a      supported concerns regarding the limits of current public understanding as\u000d\u000a      to what constitutes a `normal' reaction to sexual attack, and its\u000d\u000a      implications on jury deliberation. Many participants were adamant that a\u000d\u000a      complainant would immediately report her assault, be visibly distressed\u000d\u000a      whilst giving testimony and struggle against an attacker such that\u000d\u000a      additional injuries would have been sustained (either against the victim\u000d\u000a      or the attacker &#8212; or, optimally, against both).\u000d\u000a    Article (b) explores the extent to which guidance (whether provided by an\u000d\u000a      expert witness or by judicial instruction) shifted these expectations.\u000d\u000a      Participants who received guidance were more likely to question the\u000d\u000a      significance that could be attached to the timing of a rape complaint and\u000d\u000a      were more willing to accept that a `genuine' victim could exhibit few\u000d\u000a      signs of distress whilst testifying. Most continued, however, to expect\u000d\u000a      the complainant to physically resist, and to have sustained injury. It is\u000d\u000a      possible that expectations of force and resistance are so deeply ingrained\u000d\u000a      that attempts to disavow jurors of them through education in the rape\u000d\u000a      trial are unlikely to be successful. But it is also possible that guidance\u000d\u000a      which specifically addressed the feasibility of freezing in acquaintance\u000d\u000a      as well as stranger rapes could have been more effective. We found that\u000d\u000a      jurors responded in broadly similar ways regardless of whether guidance\u000d\u000a      was presented by an expert near the start of the trial or by the judge at\u000d\u000a      the end.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32985","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2215636","Name":"Libya"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"1220409","Name":"Tajikistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1522867","Name":"Kazakhstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2464461","Name":"Tunisia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"1512440","Name":"Uzbekistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3723988","Name":"Haiti"},{"GeoNamesId":"7909807","Name":"South Sudan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2275384","Name":"Liberia"},{"GeoNamesId":"597427","Name":"Lithuania"},{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The general principles of prison law and policy developed in the research\u000a      of DvZS and RM have\u000a      shaped the legal framework for modern prison regimes and changed their\u000a      practices in various\u000a      ways. This has occurred both at the international and the national level\u000a      in relation to imprisonment\u000a      generally, but also more specifically in relation to life imprisonment,\u000a      sanctions for young offenders\u000a      and the systems used to detain and transfer international and foreign\u000a      prisoners.\u000a    (1) Prisons: General and Comparative: DvZS's research on\u000a      imprisonment (Output 1a) led to his\u000a      appointment as a scientific expert by the Council for Penological\u000a      Cooperation (PCCP) of the\u000a      Council of Europe. Along with other experts, Prof. Andrew Coyle (King's\u000a      College London) and Prof.\u000a      Gerard de Jonge (University of Maastricht), DvZS had a key part in\u000a      developing and drafting the\u000a      2006 EPR and writing the accompanying official commentary. These Rules\u000a      have had an enormous\u000a      impact in the period under review. Between 2008 and August 2012, the CPT\u000a      (the main body\u000a      responsible for inspecting places of detention in Europe) cited these\u000a      Rules 88 times, in 37 of its\u000a      reports. These references are significant as the CPT used the Rules in its\u000a      reports to states to\u000a      indicate how they should improve their prison practices (See\u000a        http:\/\/cpt.coe.int\/en\/).\u000a    During the same period, the EPR were also cited with approval by the\u000a      ECtHR in 110 of its\u000a      judgments. In these cases reference was made to 751 different rules, as in\u000a      several cases more\u000a      than one Rule was cited. In some instances the impact on practice was\u000a      particularly direct. In the\u000a      case of G&#252;lmez v. Turkey (Application no. 16330\/02, 20 May 2008),\u000a      for example, the Court held\u000a      that the existing prison disciplinary system did not protect prisoners'\u000a      human rights adequately and\u000a      then ordered the Turkish government specifically \"to bring its legislation\u000a      in line with the principles\u000a      set out in Articles 57 &#167; 2 (b) and 59 (c) of the European Prison Rules\",\u000a      i.e., the specific provisions\u000a      in the EPR dealing with the requirements for proper prison disciplinary\u000a      practices.\u000a    Moreover, on 17 October 2011, the Council of Europe published its own\u000a      survey of the\u000a      \"implementation of the most recent Council of Europe Standards related to\u000a      the Treatment of\u000a      Offenders while in custody\" (Source 1a). This survey provided evidence of\u000a      the widespread\u000a      influence of the EPR in individual countries. In particular, 24 of the 31\u000a      respondent states reviewed\u000a      their national legislation in the light of the EPR. Training courses were\u000a      implemented in 29 countries\u000a      based on the EPR. Some countries made specific changes to bring national\u000a      practice into line with\u000a      the rules. For example, the Russian Federation reported that, as a result\u000a      of the EPR, it was\u000a      allowing the children of female prisoners to remain with their mothers and\u000a      granting extended visits\u000a      to prisoners by their family members.\u000a    The European Union is also beginning to take an interest in prison\u000a      policy. DvZS was invited as\u000a      an independent expert to a number of meetings where the government members\u000a      debated policy in\u000a      this area. The 2011 Green Paper on the application of EU criminal\u000a        justice legislation in the field of\u000a        detention (Source 1b) refers to the book by Van Zyl Smit and Snacken\u000a      (Output 1b) - the only \"non-\u000a      official\" source on which it relies. The Green Paper is expected to have\u000a      an important impact on EU\u000a      policy.\u000a    The influence of the general principles of prison law established by DvZS\u000a      and Snacken in their\u000a      book (Output 1b) can also be seen in the Model Detention Code that DvZS\u000a      developed together\u000a      with a barrister, Adam Stapleton, for the US Institute for Peace (USIP) in\u000a      2009-2011. The\u000a      Detention Code follows the structure of prison law propounded in the book.\u000a      The Detention Code\u000a      forms part of a series of related Model Codes covering the whole area of\u000a      criminal justice, which are\u000a      designed to be used in post-conflict or failed states where a new legal\u000a      framework is required to be\u000a      introduced quickly. USIP has reported that the Model Detention Code has\u000a      been used by\u000a      lawmakers in Haiti, Liberia and South Sudan, and that it was also\u000a      requested by the International\u000a      Committee of the Red Cross to give to a number of further countries, the\u000a      names of which are\u000a      confidential. USIP also plans to distribute it to colleagues in Libya and\u000a      Syria. (Testimonial 1).\u000a    The same general principles of prison law were fully deployed in a new\u000a      Prison Act that DvZS\u000a      and Adam Stapleton developed in 2010-2011 for the GIZ (the German\u000a      government development\u000a      agency) to present to the government of Bangladesh. There has been\u000a      intensive interaction with the\u000a      government of Bangladesh about the new law, in which DvZS has been closely\u000a      involved. This work\u000a      has, at the very least, shaped debate about prison policy in that country.\u000a      (Testimonial 2).\u000a    (2) Life Imprisonment: Since 2008 DvZS's work on life\u000a      imprisonment has had considerable\u000a      international impact. The ECtHR has referred to his article on outlawing\u000a      irreducible life sentences\u000a      (Output 2b) as an authoritative portrayal of the use of such sentences in\u000a      Europe on three separate\u000a      occasions in 2012 (Source 2). In 2013, he advised the successful applicant\u000a      to the Grand Chamber\u000a      in the case which finally declared irreducible life sentences to infringe\u000a      the European Convention on\u000a      Human Rights (Source 2). More generally, there has been a renewed interest\u000a      in life imprisonment\u000a      as an alternative to the death penalty. On 25 and 26 April 2011, DvZS\u000a      spoke in Astana to senior\u000a      representatives of the governments of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and\u000a      Tajikistan about what they\u000a      should do with the increasing numbers of lifers in their prisons (Output\u000a      2b was made available to\u000a      the government representatives at the meeting in Russian by the NGO Penal\u000a      Reform International\u000a      (Testimonial 3)), since their adoption of a moratorium on the death\u000a      penalty and contributed to the\u000a      drafting of a resolution supported by all participants (Sources 3a and\u000a      3b). In December 2011 DvZS\u000a      advised members of the Tunisian Constitutional Assembly in Tunis about\u000a      life imprisonment as a\u000a      viable alternative to the death penalty (Output 2a).\u000a    (3) Sanctions for Young Offenders: As a result of their research\u000a      on youth imprisonment (Output\u000a      3a) both DvZS and Prof. Frieder Dunkel (along with Prof. Andrea Baechtold,\u000a      University of Berne)\u000a      were appointed as scientific experts by the PCCP to draft a recommendation\u000a      and accompanying\u000a      commentary on the treatment of juvenile offenders (Output 3b). The\u000a      resulting 2008\u000a      Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers on the European Rules for\u000a      Juvenile Offenders\u000a      subject to Sanctions or Measures has had measurable impact in a wide range\u000a      of states. A Council\u000a      of Europe report (Source 1a) revealed that a majority of member states\u000a      used this Recommendation\u000a      to train their juvenile justice staff. Several states have also introduced\u000a      specific reforms based on\u000a      these Rules, ranging from additional access to correspondence and cultural\u000a      and sports events for\u000a      detained juveniles in Bulgaria, the creation of a new social integration\u000a      unit for such juveniles in\u000a      Lithuania. The impact of the Juvenile Offender Rules has been enhanced by\u000a      the CPT, which\u000a      referred to them in nine of its reports to states on their detention\u000a      systems, between 2008 and\u000a      August 2012. See http:\/\/cpt.coe.int\/en\/\u000a    (4) Transfer and Treatment of International and Foreign Prisoners:\u000a      The research that DvZS\u000a      and RM conducted on the international transfer of prisoners (Output 4b)\u000a      enabled DvZS to advise\u000a      the government of Malaysia in 2009 on both the substantive law, and key\u000a      requirements for drafting\u000a      legislation in this field. The impact of this research was significant as\u000a      it enabled Malaysia to\u000a      develop both a new policy and draft legislation in an area where it had no\u000a      clear prior policies\u000a      (Testimonial 4). The legislation was adopted by the Malaysian Parliament\u000a      in November 2012.\u000a      RM and DVZS were also invited in 2010 by the United Nations Office on\u000a      Drugs and Crime in\u000a      Vienna to develop a handbook for policy makers around the world on the\u000a      transfer of sentenced\u000a      prisoners. The UN Handbook on the International Transfer of Sentenced\u000a      Persons (Source 4) is\u000a      freely available to states to use as a guide for legislative and policy\u000a      development in this field.\u000a    These outputs also helped to inform the development of regional penal\u000a      policy in relation to the\u000a      treatment of non-national prisoners. From 2010-2012, DvZS and RM (and\u000a      Prof. Herzog-Evans of\u000a      the University of Rheims) worked with the Council of Europe's PCCP and\u000a      member states to\u000a      develop a new and updated recommendation on the treatment of foreign\u000a      prisoners\u000a      (CM\/Rec(2012)12) and its accompanying commentary. As with the other\u000a      Council of Europe\u000a      Recommendations, its application in 47 member states will ensure that it\u000a      will have significant\u000a      impact. In particular, this Recommendation will be of considerable value\u000a      and use to national prison\u000a      authorities struggling to cope with overcrowded prisons with an\u000a      over-represented foreign prisoner\u000a      population and striving to ensure the equal and individual treatment of\u000a      all prisoners (Testimonial 5).\u000a      In recognition of RM's research into the systems for detaining and\u000a      imprisoning those indicted and\u000a      convicted by international criminal courts (Outputs 4a and 4b), the\u000a      International Criminal Court\u000a      invited her to participate in seminars focused on developing international\u000a      detention law and policy.\u000a      In particular, at a seminar on 9-10 2008 discussed amendments to the ICC's\u000a      Regulations of the\u000a      Registry RM's views were requested in relation to changes to international\u000a      detention law.

Cooperation with\u000a      scholars abroad and regional and international bodies and courts provided\u000a      research opportunities\u000a      in this area. Within the relevant period, this research focused on:\u000a    (1) Prisons: General and Comparative: The key research insight is\u000a      that carefully crafted penal\u000a      and prison law, based on a sound understanding of human rights, can have a\u000a      significant impact on\u000a      prison conditions and penal outcomes generally. This is reflected in the\u000a      international comparative\u000a      research that DvZS, together with Prof. Frieder D&#252;nkel (University of\u000a      Greifswald), undertook to\u000a      establish the underlying principles of prison law and policy (Output 1a).\u000a      Throughout the 2000s,\u000a      DvZS continued to pursue further research on prison law and policy.\u000a      Research undertaken to\u000a      inform the drafting of the 2006 European Prison Rules (EPR) for the\u000a      Council of Europe (see below)\u000a      formed the basis for work on a definitive monograph on European prison law\u000a      and policy, co-\u000a      authored by DvZS and Prof. Sonja Snacken (Free University of Brussels)\u000a      (Output 1b). Through\u000a      detailed legal analysis of the judgments of the European Court of Human\u000a      Rights (ECtHR), the\u000a      reports of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), and\u000a      the Rules and\u000a      Recommendations of the Council of Europe, this book develops a principled\u000a      position on the rights\u000a      and duties of prisoners and prison authorities.\u000a    (2) Life Imprisonment: DvZS has pursued, largely independently,\u000a      research on life imprisonment\u000a      across the world. This work dealt with both the imposition and\u000a      implementation of life imprisonment\u000a      and argued that standards should be developed to ensure both that life\u000a      imprisonment was used\u000a      only for the most serious offences and that all persons sentenced to life\u000a      imprisonment should have\u000a      the prospect of being considered for release at some equitably determined\u000a      point during their\u000a      sentences. DvZS' initial study of life imprisonment in the USA, the UK and\u000a      Germany (as well as in\u000a      international criminal tribunals) was published in 2002 (Output 2a). It\u000a      was followed by an intensive\u000a      study of irreducible life sentences in Europe (2010) (Output 2b).\u000a    (3) Sanctions for Young Offenders: DvZS undertook research with\u000a      Professor Frieder D&#252;nkel on\u000a      the application of general prisoners' rights law to incarcerated young\u000a      offenders (Output 3a).\u000a      Similarly, DvZS and his co-advisers on the European Rules for Juvenile\u000a      Offenders subject to\u000a      Sanctions or Measures produced a series of publications on the topic in\u000a      order to explain the\u000a      principles that underlie it and to publicise it more widely (Output 3b).\u000a    (4) Transfer and Treatment of International and Foreign Prisoners:\u000a      The general rights-based\u000a      approach to imprisonment was taken further by RM, who developed additional\u000a      insights about\u000a      prisoners' rights in general as well as about specific questions relating\u000a      to the enforcement of\u000a      international sentences of imprisonment and the transfer of sentenced\u000a      prisoners from one country\u000a      to another. RM's research on the issue of international imprisonment began\u000a      during her PhD\u000a      studies, supervised by DvZS, who had published on the topic, and continued\u000a      upon her\u000a      appointment to a lectureship in September 2010. RM's findings from an\u000a      extensive period of\u000a      empirical research formed the basis of a substantial monograph on the\u000a      topic (Output 4a). Both\u000a      publications outline the current systems used to detain and imprison\u000a      persons accused or convicted\u000a      for the commission of international crimes, and make recommendations for\u000a      the strategic and\u000a      structural development of the international penal system. Further research\u000a      comparing the\u000a      international and inter-state systems for the transfer of prisoners was\u000a      also published as an article\u000a      (Output 4b).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32986","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"203312","Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2403846","Name":"Sierra Leone"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Since 2008, Bekou's research has significantly strengthened the capacity\u000a      of International Criminal Justice Institutions (the ICC) and States\u000a      (investigators, prosecutors, judges, defence lawyers, legislation\u000a      drafters, ministries) dealing with the most serious international crimes.\u000a      The distinctive significance of the research is that it tackles the key\u000a      challenges by:\u000a    1) providing global access to legal information;\u000a    2) facilitating the transfer of legal knowledge, expertise and skills\u000a      through appropriate analytical and methodological frameworks, and\u000a    3) enhancing capacity in post-conflict States.\u000a    First, the capacity of national and international criminal justice\u000a      institutions is significantly empowered through free, universal access to\u000a      legal information. Bekou's electronic knowledge platform (www.legal-tools.org),\u000a      offers an expansive library of legal documents and a range of research and\u000a      reference tools. 42,000 users from over 150 countries access the 67,000\u000a      documents currently on the database each month [B]. A letter sent\u000a      to all ICC State parties by the ICC Prosecutor (2011) recognises that the\u000a      Legal Tools \"has become the leading resource for legal information on core\u000a      international crimes\"[C]. Given that such legal information is not\u000a      normally available free of charge, under-resourced jurisdictions are\u000a      usually precluded from accessing it, thereby significantly lacking in\u000a      capacity. The fact that the Legal Tools tackles this key challenge has\u000a      been recognised by numerous States. In its official address to the ICC\u000a      Assembly of States Parties (ASP), Finland (2012) noted that the Legal\u000a      Tools \"provid[e] equal access to legal sources, which lies at the heart of\u000a      the complementarity challenge\"[G]. Austria (2008, 2009), Denmark\u000a      (2012), Finland (2009, 2011, 2012), the Netherlands (2011), Norway (2011,\u000a      2012) and Romania (2012), acknowledge the Legal Tools' value and\u000a      \"significant contribution\" to building national capacity through extensive\u000a      references in their official statements at the United Nations and the ASPs\u000a      [F,G]. Finally, in the 2012 Mbarushimana decision,\u000a      (ICC-01\/04-01\/10-OA-4, fn.79, 84, 86) the ICC Appeals Chamber started\u000a      using the Legal Tools methodology in all its citations [A]. In its\u000a      official statement in the 2012 ASP, Norway (commenting on this\u000a      development) stated that \"this attests to the reliability of this database\u000a      and makes the sources cited immediately available to all readers who have\u000a      access to the internet\"[G]. Besides this universal reach, the\u000a      analytical frameworks developed alongside the raw data [6],[C,F,G]\u000a      facilitate increased compliance with the ICC regime. Romania (2012) [G]\u000a      observed that `it leads towards an effective universality of the Rome\u000a      Statute'. The significance of NILD, the Nottingham-developed legal tool\u000a      for drafting national legislation (used also by Samoa for the drafting of\u000a      its legislation) has been recognised by the ASP Cooperation Working Group.\u000a      In its 2012 report (paras. 9,10,13), the Group formally requested its\u000a      future expansion [2],[D]. Since 2009, the 122 State Parties to the\u000a      ICC, in Resolutions adopted by consensus at the end of each ASP session\u000a      (2009, para.36; 2010, para.48; 2011, para.63; 2012, para.10), have\u000a      repeatedly highlighted the value of the Legal Tools, recognising their\u000a      \"significant contribution [...] to the promotion of international criminal\u000a      law and justice and thus to combating impunity\" [3],[H].\u000a    Second, the methodology developed by Bekou has changed the way in which\u000a      serious international crimes cases are organised, presented and disclosed\u000a      before the ICC [1,4,5]. The ICC adopted this methodology when it\u000a      held in Bemba: \"Each piece of evidence must be analysed -page by\u000a      page or, where required, paragraph by paragraph- by relating each piece of\u000a      information contained in that page or paragraph with one or more of the\u000a      constituent elements or one or more of the crimes with which the person is\u000a      charged, including the contextual elements of those crimes, as well as the\u000a      constituent elements of the mode of participation in the offence with\u000a      which person is charged\" [1,4,5],[A]. Since 2008, nine ICC\u000a      decisions have adopted this approach (in the Bemba, Katanga,\u000a      Muthaura and Ruto cases), which has been found to enhance:\u000a      (i) the efficiency of the criminal justice process and (ii) protection of\u000a      the rights of the accused [A,E]. The ICC President\u000a      acknowledged in 2009 that this legal tool `mak[es] the review of evidence\u000a      more efficient and enable[es] the judges to organise the presentation of\u000a      evidence in an expeditious manner' [E].\u000a    Third, in 2011-3 the research provided resources that led to improvements\u000a      in sex crimes prosecutions in the DRC and an increased observance of fair\u000a      trial standards in Sierra Leone. In DRC, the Minister of Justice (MoJ)\u000a      adopted the Nottingham developed `DOCF', [6a],[J] and piloted it\u000a      in two regions. In 2012, the MoJ decided to expand its use to a third\u000a      region with DOCF gaining first place in 2013 regarding the price\/quality\u000a      correlation as a coordination tool.

The \"complementarity\"\u000a      principle stipulates that the Court can only exercise jurisdiction if\u000a      national courts are \"unwilling\" or \"unable\" to investigate or prosecute\u000a      the listed crimes. Consequently, the ICC regime places great emphasis on\u000a      the capacity of such courts to undertake prosecutions.\u000a    The research undertaken by Olympia Bekou, (Lecturer, Associate Professor\u000a      and Professor, in the School of Law, 2005-present), identifies the key\u000a      challenges impeding the capacity to investigate and prosecute the most\u000a      serious international crimes. The research uniquely uses new technologies\u000a      to enhance such capacity and to facilitate better administration of\u000a      criminal justice for atrocities. It involves research outputs in the form\u000a      of academic publications and legal databases. Whilst all references below\u000a      relate to research carried out at Nottingham, the Legal Tools Database [6a],\u000a      besides having a distinct Nottingham component (NILD) has benefitted from\u000a      collaboration with other partners. However, Bekou's input in the overall\u000a      design, methodology and dissemination renders the Legal Tools Database a\u000a      predominantly Nottingham output.\u000a    First, the research identifies capacity issues that hinder the effective\u000a      administration of justice. These are: difficulties in accessing\u000a      information, lack of skills and expertise. These are then addressed by\u000a      identifying how to bridge the gap between institutions in well-resourced\u000a      and under-resourced jurisdictions so as to level the playing field in the\u000a      investigation and prosecution of the most serious international crimes. [3]\u000a      The research channels its findings in the creation of a free, online,\u000a      publicly available legal information platform, the Legal Tools Database,\u000a      which, for maximum outreach and dissemination, is hosted on the Court's\u000a      official website (see www.legal-tools.org). This platform is then used to\u000a      build national and international capacity [6a].\u000a    Second, the research introduces a set of conceptual\/analytical resources:\u000a      (a) the Legal Requirements document, detailing the legal requirements of\u000a      all crimes and modes of liability in the Statute of the ICC; (b) a bespoke\u000a      metadata scheme (i.e. a taxonomy that determines the mark-up of documents\u000a      and increases the quality of database searches); (c) a comprehensive\u000a      keywords list which maps the discipline of international criminal law [2,4,6a].\u000a      In addition, the research devises a methodology to oversee serious\u000a      international crimes cases and provides a framework for structured\u000a      analysis of the way courts deal with facts, means of proof and evidence\u000a      which the ICC has adopted, in the form of `in-depth analysis charts', to\u000a      improve its jurisprudence [5,1].\u000a    Third, by also concentrating on two particular post-conflict states, the\u000a      DRC and Sierra Leone, the research has produced a separate methodology for\u000a      the prioritisation and documentation of open case files (DOCF), which has\u000a      been adopted by the DRC government to tackle sex crimes and a set of `best\u000a      practices' on fair trial standards, which have been officially adopted by\u000a      the Sierra Leonean government. Both these outputs have significantly\u000a      enhanced compliance with international standards [6a and 6b].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35161","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Unit's progressive research into information rights law has resulted\u000d\u000a      in our researchers writing two definitive practitioner texts on the\u000d\u000a      subject (2009 and 2011) and has directly benefited two public bodies,\u000d\u000a      providing them with the tools and training required to bridge the gap\u000d\u000a      between legislation and operational requirements.

In 2011, the council commissioned Wolf to\u000d\u000a      deliver bespoke training to key officers within the organisation on the\u000d\u000a      Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIR) and its relationship to\u000d\u000a      the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). In April 2011, 30 senior\u000d\u000a      officers across a range of service departments within Durham County\u000d\u000a      Council received training on the EIR and in particular how service\u000d\u000a      departments are required to recognise requests for environmental\u000d\u000a      information so as to ensure compliance with the statutory provisions. The\u000d\u000a      training provided knowledge and expertise that allowed the Principal\u000d\u000a      Information Officer at Durham County Council to develop his own training\u000d\u000a      sessions as well as frequently asked questions and answers for use by\u000d\u000a      officers in the service departments. The Officer produced a revised FOIA\u000d\u000a      procedures packet clearly establishing processes and policies to deal with\u000d\u000a      requests which is widely in use by the local authority.

Second, it has prompted the\u000d\u000a      MMO to set up a senior level working group to review and develop new\u000d\u000a      departmental procedures regarding information sharing. The MMO is a\u000d\u000a      non-departmental government body. It has approximately 321 members of\u000d\u000a      staff. The MMO is responsible for the sustainable development of the\u000d\u000a      marine area. It has statutory responsibilities for fisheries management,\u000d\u000a      licensing, planning and regulatory enforcement. The MMO is a relatively\u000d\u000a      new organisation, established in 2010, and it therefore required training\u000d\u000a      in information rights law and information sharing, specifically tailored\u000d\u000a      to its needs, in order to fulfil statutory and regulatory functions. Our\u000d\u000a      group met with MMO officers shortly after it was established to discuss\u000d\u000a      their issues regarding information sharing and disclosure. This led to\u000d\u000a      research projects between 2010-13 reviewing its FOIA compliance and\u000d\u000a      providing research expertise relating to data sharing processes derived\u000d\u000a      from IRRIG's research into public organisation best practice. In 2011,\u000d\u000a      over 80 officers of MMO from throughout the UK received training over\u000d\u000a      seven days in Bristol and Newcastle (12 training courses were delivered\u000d\u000a      and a new methodological approach to sharing of information was\u000d\u000a      addressed).\u000d\u000a    The MMO commissioned the IRRIG to undertake further research projects in\u000d\u000a      2012. The first was to provide a review of the MMO's handling of requests\u000d\u000a      for information using freedom of information legislation. The second was\u000d\u000a      to provide an evaluation of the MMO data handling procedure. In this\u000d\u000a      regard the MMO's Litigation Lawyer comments:\u000d\u000a    \"The result of the combined projects was twofold. In the first\u000d\u000a        instance the MMO gained a very clear insight into the close relationship\u000d\u000a        between its operational practices and its obligations under information\u000d\u000a        sharing legislation. Second, and more importantly, the process has\u000d\u000a        resulted in the establishment of a senior level working group to review\u000d\u000a        MMO policy and procedure.

Information Rights is a fast developing area and includes Freedom\u000d\u000a      of Information, Data Protection and Environmental Information. Our remit\u000d\u000a      has extended to embrace research into privacy, breach of confidence and\u000d\u000a      issuance of injunctions. The Unit has developed a research group dedicated\u000d\u000a      to the research, publication and dissemination of information rights\u000d\u000a      scholarship. The Unit has been at the forefront of research into the\u000d\u000a      practical and substantive application of this new legal framework and\u000d\u000a      development of new methodologies for investigating information rights and\u000d\u000a      the use of FOIs as a research tool. Initial research by Kerrigan\u000d\u000a      (2002), Bessant (2009) and Wolf (2011), all researchers at\u000d\u000a      Northumbria 2002-13, highlighted knowledge gaps amongst both practitioner\u000d\u000a      and academic groups working in this developing field and the group has\u000d\u000a      subsequently identified and mapped a new methodology to change working\u000d\u000a      methods.\u000d\u000a    The central research question addressed by this group is:\u000d\u000a    How do public authorities who have a regulatory function and accordingly\u000d\u000a      hold personal, confidential and commercial information, fulfil their\u000d\u000a      statutory obligations to disclose information in the public interest\u000d\u000a      without compromising private information?\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The research was undertaken in a variety of ways using methodologies\u000d\u000a        appropriate to specific aims; Doctrinal and theoretical research, aimed\u000d\u000a        at establishing the requirements and scope of the legislation (Bessant,\u000a          Wolf, Moosavian, Savage and Hyde).\u000d\u000a      Research aimed at establishing the challenges for users of the\u000d\u000a        legislation (data subjects, application for information and those\u000d\u000a        responsible for the management of the information) and examining the\u000d\u000a        implementation of the different requirements governing information (Savage\u000d\u000a        and Hyde).\u000d\u000a      Critique of the current approach and suggestions for reform (Moosavian,\u000a          Savage and Hyde).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The research conducted by Moosavian (Senior Lecturer from\u000d\u000a      2008-13) has established a new conception of confidence and privacy. The\u000d\u000a      research was conducted in 2011 and published in April 2012. Moosavian\u000d\u000a      charted the emergence of a new action termed `misuse of private\u000d\u000a      information' (MPI), from traditional common law breach of confidence. The\u000d\u000a      new action has been employed to resolve privacy disputes and encompasses\u000d\u000a      Articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human\u000d\u000a      Rights Act 1998. The research engages a detailed examination of case law\u000d\u000a      to demonstrate precisely how elements within traditional breach of\u000d\u000a      confidence have been used to shape and inform the new two-stage MPI test.\u000d\u000a      For example, notions of confidential relationship and public domain are\u000d\u000a      relevant to the first-stage question of whether a claimant has a\u000d\u000a      reasonable expectation of privacy: and public interest issues play a vital\u000d\u000a      role in the second-stage balancing exercise.\u000d\u000a    Research by Savage (2011-13 Senior Lecturer) and Hyde\u000d\u000a      (2011-13, Lecturer at Northumbria) has created a new methodology for using\u000d\u000a      freedom of information requests to conduct large scale empirical research.\u000d\u000a      This research was conducted and published in 2012. The research produced\u000d\u000a      the first article, since FOIA came into force, proposing FOIA requests as\u000d\u000a      a research methodology. The second article by Savage and Hyde\u000d\u000a      (2013) reports on findings from a research project using a facilitative\u000d\u000a      method. The research was conducted in 2011-12 and key findings published\u000d\u000a      in June 2013. The data study involved Freedom of Information requests to\u000d\u000a      48 local authorities to facilitate evaluations and draw conclusions about\u000d\u000a      the manner in which Freedom of Information requests were being handled by\u000d\u000a      local authorities and to make recommendations about the handling of such\u000d\u000a      requests. Critical review of best practice was achieved by integrated\u000d\u000a      research with a significant group of local authorities. The research focus\u000d\u000a      has broadened to map the use of whistleblowing disclosures within a\u000d\u000a      complex regulatory landscape, involving both local authorities and\u000d\u000a      national regulators.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35162","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"174982","Name":"Armenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"617790","Name":"Moldova"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    National and global reach of the research to build Clinic capacity\u000d\u000a    Wider dissemination of the research has taken place via consultancy and\u000d\u000a      conferences.

Each year, approximately\u000d\u000a      170 undergraduate and postgraduate law students have been supervised by 20\u000d\u000a      members of staff with the support of 2 administrators and 2 trainee\u000d\u000a      solicitors. Clients are represented in more than 11 legal practice areas.\u000d\u000a      As a result, there has been a direct beneficial impact to the community.\u000d\u000a      From 1 January 2008 to date, the office has dealt with 2,761 new enquiries\u000d\u000a      from members of the public and businesses, resulting in 1,127 clients\u000d\u000a      being fully represented recovering over &#163;840,000 for these clients. Each\u000d\u000a      year, students and staff provide over 50,000 hours of free legal advice\u000d\u000a      and representation.\u000d\u000a    Impact on voluntary community legal services\u000d\u000a    In the voluntary and community sector, the SLO partners with Shelter, the\u000d\u000a      homelessness charity, to offer a national advice service to homeless and\u000d\u000a      at risk clients. Since 2009, the SLO has provided expert research on\u000d\u000a      complex problems the Shelter advisers are unable to resolve. A project\u000d\u000a      with Newcastle Citizens Advice Bureau developed a new form of training and\u000d\u000a      accreditation for law students, enabling them to become Gateway Advisers,\u000d\u000a      dealing with over 6,000 issues in the two years since the start of the\u000d\u000a      project in 2011. In collaboration with Age UK, the SLO established an\u000d\u000a      outreach office to provide an accessible legal service for elderly and\u000d\u000a      infirm clients. A partnership with Victim Support set up in 2012 provides\u000d\u000a      advocacy services for clients in challenging decisions of the Criminal\u000d\u000a      Injuries Compensation Authority, which the charity could not provide.\u000d\u000a    Impact on the practice of the legal profession\u000d\u000a    The Law Clinic Group's research indicated that real world experience is\u000d\u000a      critical in vocational education. The SLO works in collaboration with more\u000d\u000a      than 10 regional law firms on Law School inspired pro bono projects,\u000d\u000a      delivering benefits to the community as well as encouraging a culture of\u000d\u000a      free advice in these firms. Building on this, the SLO with national pro\u000d\u000a      bono charity LawWorks, launched the LawWorks North East Pro Bono Hub in\u000d\u000a      2011. The SLO is at the centre of the Hub, acting as a catalyst and\u000d\u000a      facilitator for a regional network of law firms to offer free legal advice\u000d\u000a      to the public and community groups in the North East and Cumbria. This\u000d\u000a      successful collaboration has led LawWorks to expand this model to other\u000d\u000a      regions including the North West and Wales (2012-13). The Legal Advice\u000d\u000a      Byker project with leading legal aid firm, Ben Hoare Bell LLP, created a\u000d\u000a      community outreach programme in 2011. This is in a deprived area of\u000d\u000a      Newcastle: students provide immediate legal advice to the public,\u000d\u000a      supervised by Ben Hoare Bell LLP lawyers. Over 90 people were helped in\u000d\u000a      the first year of operation.\u000d\u000a    Impact on regulators and policy makers\u000d\u000a    The SLO regularly hosts visits by MPs, Government ministers (including\u000d\u000a      two Attorneys General and the Solicitor General) and professional\u000d\u000a      regulators. This has resulted in membership of the influential\u000d\u000a      Attorney-General's Pro Bono Committee which co-ordinates National Pro Bono\u000d\u000a      Week and advises on government pro bono policy. The integrated clinical\u000d\u000a      model was recommended by the ACLEC First Report on Legal Education. In\u000d\u000a      2009, the school persuaded the Solicitors Regulation Authority to approve\u000d\u000a      a five-year pilot of a full qualification M Law degree, combining theory,\u000d\u000a      skills and clinic\/workplace training.

This research has led to new insights\u000d\u000a      into how students engage with legal theory in a practical context, thus\u000d\u000a      underpinning the development and dissemination of a new model of law\u000d\u000a      clinic at the core of the curriculum. The key finding is that supervised\u000d\u000a      real life experience enables students to better understand the legal rules\u000d\u000a      and practical reflection required for legal practice. The research has\u000d\u000a      also contributed to the broader academic field of professional learning,\u000d\u000a      providing cross-disciplinary insights into students' cognitive,\u000d\u000a      metacognitive and affective development and the impact this has on\u000d\u000a      employability.\u000d\u000a    The in-house live client model of clinical legal education emerged in the\u000d\u000a      UK as a direct consequence of pioneering work by Brayne\u000d\u000a      (Professor, 1985-1996), Grimes and Duncan, reflected in the 1998 book\u000d\u000a        Clinical Legal Education, Active Learning in Your Law School. This\u000d\u000a      provided a theoretical justification for clinical learning and examined\u000d\u000a      the various pedagogic models alongside associated issues such as ethics,\u000d\u000a      supervision and assessment methodology. Its conclusion was: \"The value\u000d\u000a        of clinic is not simply in its innovation and effectiveness but in the\u000d\u000a        potential it offers as a teaching and learning tool within the law\u000d\u000a        programme as a whole.\" Further research into the adult learning\u000d\u000a      process, particularly aspects of supervision, feedback, reflection and\u000d\u000a      assessment (e.g. Sylvester, Principal Lecturer 1994 to date;, Hall,\u000a        J Associate Dean 1998 to date and Hall, E 2013 to date,\u000d\u000a      2005; Plowden, Dean 1993-2011, and Kerrigan Executive\u000d\u000a      Dean, 1990 to date) showed how students benefited from authentic, real\u000d\u000a      life legal service and how it was possible to rigorously grade a\u000d\u000a      non-standard experience. Research by Kerrigan, 2007, 2011, showed\u000d\u000a      how live clinics provide a spontaneous opportunity for legal ethics\u000d\u000a      education. Outputs by Hall, J and Kerrigan 2011; Maharg,\u000d\u000a      Professor 2010-2013, 2011; and Woodley, Associate Dean 1973-2013\u000d\u000a      and Gray, Principal Lecturer 2000 to date, 2005; addressed the\u000d\u000a      integration of theoretical and practical approaches to learning law. These\u000d\u000a      and other insights from the research enabled the creation of a large,\u000d\u000a      robust and sustainable law clinic model: the Student Law Office, offering\u000d\u000a      a very wide range of free legal services to the community. Dissemination\u000d\u000a      via publication and presentations at national and international\u000d\u000a      conferences has encouraged the development of this model across the UK and\u000d\u000a      internationally, influencing other HEIs and policy-makers.\u000d\u000a    The Clinical Legal Education Group has published a range of national and\u000d\u000a      international peer reviewed outputs in high quality journals and books.\u000d\u000a      These include the only two books ever written in the UK on clinical legal\u000d\u000a      education.

Prof Patricia Wouters has worked here since 1996.\u000a    Only 158 of the world's 276 major transboundary watercourses (shared\u000a      between over 170 states)\u000a      have specific treaty arrangements in place. Many of these instruments are\u000a      inadequate to meet\u000a      contemporary challenges because they lack clear rules and institutional\u000a      mechanisms to ensure the\u000a      peaceful, equitable and reasonable use of shared water resources. In the\u000a      absence of specific\u000a      treaty arrangements, states must rely on general principles of customary\u000a      international law.\u000a      However, misperceptions and misinterpretations over the precise normative\u000a      content of these\u000a      principles limit their effectiveness.\u000a    Wouters' and Rieu-Clarke's research has revealed the importance of the\u000a      UNWC's provisions in\u000a      supplementing insufficient treaty practice. The Convention clarifies and\u000a      strengthens the principles\u000a      of customary law in this field. However, although it was adopted in 1997,\u000a      the Convention has not\u000a      yet entered into force and this has compromised peaceful transboundary\u000a      water development and\u000a      management around the world. Making the legal and policy case for its\u000a      entry into force based on a\u000a      solid research evidence base &#8212; as the authors of this case study have done\u000a      &#8212; therefore becomes\u000a      crucial.\u000a    The authors' research has increased knowledge and understanding of the\u000a      law pertaining to the use\u000a      and protection of international watercourses and concluded that the UNWC\u000a      should be adopted and\u000a      implemented. Their considerable body of research (more than 70\u000a      publications) has sourced and\u000a      analysed through legal analytical frameworks: (i) watercourse treaties\u000a      from around the world; (ii)\u000a      rules of customary law and state practice from around the world; (iii) the\u000a      work of international and\u000a      regional intergovernmental organisations, expert bodies and leading\u000a      publicists; and (iv) the\u000a      decisions of courts and tribunals.\u000a    The primary underpinning research includes Wouters' doctoral thesis\u000a      (1997, the basis for the 1996\u000a      Natural Resources Journal article) and Rieu-Clarke's doctoral\u000a      thesis, published as a monograph\u000a      (2005). These works have been supplemented by numerous publications in\u000a      peer-reviewed journals\u000a      (included in RAE 2003 and RAE 2008), research project reports and\u000a      international presentations.\u000a      Analysing more deeply the applicable laws in this field provided the\u000a      foundations by which Wouters\u000a      (2000 &amp; 2009) and Rieu-Clarke (2008 &amp; 2009) were able to advance\u000a      their research on the UNWC.\u000a      Wouters (2000) surveyed international conflicts over water, and assessed\u000a      how both the function\u000a      and content of the UNWC could help address those conflicts. By framing the\u000a      global water crisis as\u000a      a security issue, Wouters, Vinogradov (also in this UoA) and Magsig (2009)\u000a      were then able to\u000a      broaden out that analysis and make the case that international law in\u000a      general, and the UNWC in\u000a      particular, could play an important role in fostering global `water\u000a      security'.\u000a    Rieu-Clarke and Loures (2009) took this research further with their\u000a      analysis of three important\u000a      questions (i) why the UNWC, many years after its adoption, had not yet\u000a      entered into force; (ii) what\u000a      the potential benefits were of it entering into force: (iii) what action\u000a      was needed to ensure its entry\u000a      into force within the foreseeable future?

In 2011 McEleavy's expertise in\u000d\u000a      child abduction law led to him being invited to join the HELP working\u000d\u000a      group of the Council of Europe whereby a pilot on-line distance\u000d\u000a      learning course on human rights law in family matters was created for\u000d\u000a      European judges. McEleavy has provided other ad hoc forms of training,\u000d\u000a      including to: the Senators of the College of Justice, Scotland's most\u000d\u000a      senior judges, for the Judicial Studies Committee (Edinburgh 2012);\u000d\u000a      Commonwealth family law judges (Windsor 2010); specialist family law\u000d\u000a      barristers and solicitors on behalf of his own Chambers, 1 Garden Court\u000d\u000a      (London, 2006, 2010, 2011) and to the European Law Academy &#8212; ERA (Trier,\u000d\u000a      2011).

The advice McEleavy\u000d\u000a      provided had a direct and crucial impact on the drafting of the associated\u000d\u000a      statutory instrument, the Parental Responsibility and Measures for the\u000d\u000a      Protection of Children (International Obligations) (England and Wales and\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland) Regulations 2010 (SI 2010\/1898). For example, he\u000d\u000a      discovered that the failure of the EU to adapt the parallel EU rules in\u000d\u000a      Council Regulation 2201\/2003 for co-existence with the 1996 Hague\u000d\u000a      Convention, would have led to a partial application of the choice of law\u000d\u000a      rules in the latter instrument. This led the Parliamentary draftsman to\u000d\u000a      extend the scope of application of the choice of law rules in the 2010\u000d\u000a      Regulations, r. 7. See:Corroborating Evidence 5C.1.\u000d\u000a    In 2012 McEleavy was further commissioned by the Ministry of Justice to\u000d\u000a      draft a Practice Guide for judges and practitioners on the 1996 Hague\u000d\u000a      Convention.

She twice addressed EP Committees\u000d\u000a      on this topic in 2013. Her advice to the government of Montenegro in 2013\u000d\u000a      assisted in the formulation of Chapters 23 and 24 of the Montenegrin\u000d\u000a      Action Plan in the context of accession negotiations with the European\u000d\u000a      Union. See: Corroborating Evidence 5C.5.\u000d\u000a    McEleavy's expertise in the protection of children in private\u000d\u000a      international law, led to him giving evidence to the Irish High Court as\u000d\u000a      to whether Council Regulation 2201\/2003 could apply to cross-border cases\u000d\u000a      involving the detention of children for the purpose of their receiving\u000d\u000a      specialist therapeutic treatment. He subsequently advised the Irish Health\u000d\u000a      Service Executive in advance of an urgent preliminary ruling application\u000d\u000a      before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), and was a member\u000d\u000a      of the HSE legal team at the oral hearing.

This has been extremely influential in the\u000d\u000a      interpretation of the 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention and has been\u000d\u000a      cited by courts worldwide. In Mozes v.

In 2007\u000d\u000a      (Intersentia) McEleavy evaluated the impact of Council Regulation\u000d\u000a      2201\/2003 on United Kingdom law. In 2010 (ICLQ) he investigated the\u000d\u000a      impact of the EU decision that Member States ratify the 1996 Hague\u000d\u000a      Convention on the Protection of Children. The latter study also analysed\u000d\u000a      the inter-relationship of the Convention with the existing EU rules on the\u000d\u000a      protection of children contained in Council Regulation 2201\/2003.\u000d\u000a    In 2009 and 2012 he prepared papers for the UK government, as well as a\u000d\u000a      Practice Guide, all on the implementation and domestic effect of the 1996\u000d\u000a      Hague Convention. In 2012 Fiorini was commissioned to write a briefing\u000d\u000a      paper on how future EU rules on family law should be developed (European\u000d\u000a      Parliament 2013), building on her work in 2008 and 2010 (ICLQ).

RCS issued\u000a      press releases about the research, sparking media interest, including a\u000a      radio programme in which\u000a      Raitt participated: Rape Investigation, BBC Scotland, presenter\u000a      Eamon O'Neill (2009). Reports\u000a      were carried by The Times, Sunday Times, The Scotsman (a\u000a      commissioned Opinion see note 3,\u000a      below), Scotland on Sunday, The Herald (see note 5, below)\u000a      and BBC Scotland. The research also\u000a      attracted some interest from MSPs (e.g. email exchange with Alison\u000a      McInnes) in 2011 after Raitt\u000a      gave evidence to the Justice Committee on reform to evidence law and\u000a      safeguards for complainers\u000a      (13 December 2011) (see note 9, below). In 2009 the Criminal Justice and\u000a      Licensing (Scotland) Bill\u000a      introduced a new expansive regime to govern the obligatory disclosure of\u000a      evidence by the Crown\u000a      Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) to defence lawyers, which\u000a      struck at the heart of\u000a      complainers' privacy interests. Raitt's work was used by RCS to argue that\u000a      the proposed legislation\u000a      would be particularly damaging for rape complainers whose personal data,\u000a      including medical\u000a      records, once disclosed to the defence could become a source of character\u000a      evidence for their\u000a      cross-examination, without complainers having any opportunity to oppose\u000a      disclosure. These were\u000a      the type of circumstances envisaged in Raitt's research as likely to lead\u000a      to injustice, the remedy for\u000a      which was to entitle complainers to their own legal counsel, ILR, to\u000a      oppose or limit access to\u000a      records. The research also articulated the complex competing interests\u000a      which it was argued acted\u000a      to prevent the prosecutor from safeguarding the rights of complainers. The\u000a      research was used by\u000a      RCS to argue that complainers' privacy rights under article 8 of the ECHR\u000a      could be seriously\u000a      undermined without access to ILR. During the passage of the Bill, Raitt\u000a      produced a Briefing Paper\u000a      for RCS, (http:\/\/www.rapecrisisscotland.org.uk\/publications\/resources\/:\u000a      see note 6, below) based\u000a      on the research report, detailing the Bill's negative effects upon rape\u000a      complainers. This Paper was\u000a      downloadable from the RCS website and led to Raitt being invited by the\u000a      team steering the\u000a      legislation through Parliament to meet with them and RCS to discuss her\u000a      critique of the proposed\u000a      regime (Summer, 2009). Since the Bill became legislation in 2010, the\u000a      issue of disclosure and\u000a      privacy rights has continued to attract considerable criticism from some\u000a      practitioners and NGOs.\u000a      The COPFS responded to concerns over disclosure by publishing a leaflet\u000a      intended to allay\u000a      complainers' fears (COPFS Policy on Sensitive and Personal Records &#8212;\u000a      Information leaflet, May\u000a      2011: see note 8, below). In 2011 the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u000a      responded to\u000a      disquiet over the effect on privacy rights by sponsoring an international\u000a      conference devoted to ILR\u000a      for prosecutors, academics and practitioners: Without Fear or Favour:\u000a        A Voice for Rape Survivors\u000a        in the Criminal Justice System. Raitt gave a keynote presentation.\u000a      Other speakers were: Derek\u000a      Ogg QC, Head, National Sex Crimes Unit Scotland; Kate Mulkerrins, Head of\u000a      Policy DPP Ireland;\u000a      and Prof Lise Gotell, Canada (see note 4, below). Since 2008 Raitt has\u000a      given another 3 keynote\u000a      conference papers on ILR and 7 papers at workshops or research seminars\u000a      involving prosecutors,\u000a      legal and non-legal practitioners, policy-makers and academics.\u000a    Raitt's work has led to invitations to participate at policy-making\u000a      events organised by the Scottish\u000a      Government, including a consultation seminar (October, 2011) on EU\u000a      Directive 2011\/0129 (COD)\u000a      which recommended numerous rights for victims of crime including access to\u000a      legal assistance (see\u000a      note 7, below). ILR also featured in the international research programme,\u000a      Re-thinking Responses\u000a        to Rape, funded by the Scottish Universities Insight Institute\u000a      (SUII). Raitt was a co-applicant for the\u000a      SUII programme which had a multi-sector and multi-disciplinary focus, with\u000a      contributions from UK\u000a      and international participants, including representatives from Canada,\u000a      Ireland and Austria which\u000a      permit ILR. Following this programme, in late 2012 RCS established a small\u000a      working group\u000a      including Raitt and two experienced solicitor-advocates to design a pilot\u000a      ILR model suitable for\u000a      introduction in Scotland. The working group finalised its recommendations\u000a      in July 2013 and, at the\u000a      invitation of Scottish Government, the National Co-ordinator of RCS\u000a      submitted the model to\u000a      Government for their consideration (see note 10, below). This development\u000a      is particularly\u000a      significant as the consultation paper, Making Justice Work for Victims\u000a        and Witnesses (Scottish\u000a      Government, 2012) attracted responses in support of ILR. The Victims and\u000a      Witnesses Bill\u000a      introduced to Parliament in February 2013 provided an opportunity to\u000a      legislate on ILR. In their\u000a      Stage 1 Report on the Bill, the Justice Committee of the Scottish\u000a      Parliament stated: \"...we do\u000a      consider this issue [ILR] to be worthy of further consideration and we\u000a      therefore ask the Scottish\u000a      Government to examine this proposal further with the two organisations\u000a      [Faculty of Advocates and\u000a      RCS] and others and to report back to the Committee in due course.\"\u000a      http:\/\/www.scottish.parliament.uk\/S4_JusticeCommittee\/Reports\/juR-13-07w.pdf:\u000a      at para 148 (see\u000a      note 9, below). A subsequent meeting to discuss ILR involving Raitt, RCS,\u000a      Scottish Government\u000a      and the Crown Office took place on 15 October 2013. Further meetings are\u000a      planned.\u000a    Raitt's work for RCS has irrevocably changed the terms of the debate.\u000a      There is increasing\u000a      recognition within the legal profession and by politicians that the COPFS\u000a      position is untenable.\u000a      (Justice Scotland Seminar (Glasgow, 2012); Sir Gerald Gordon Seminar\u000a      (Edinburgh, 2012) Faculty\u000a      of Advocates, evidence to Justice Committee (2013)). It is notable that at\u000a      several public events the\u000a      COPFS has felt it necessary to defend its position on ILR and justify the\u000a      organisation's view that\u000a      prosecutors are capable of supporting complainers (e.g. presentation by\u000a      Ogg QC, and panel\u000a      discussion in Without Fear or Favour: A Voice for Rape Survivors in the\u000a      Criminal Justice System,\u000a      Conference Proceedings; Sir Gerald Gordon Seminar; Scottish Women's Aid,\u000a      Carloway Round\u000a      Table Seminar, Edinburgh, 2012). This represents a significant shift in\u000a      position: suggestions of ILR\u000a      were previously dismissed as fanciful, irrelevant and incompatible with\u000a      adversarial proceedings\u000a      and a fair trial.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research on ILR undertaken by Professor Fiona Raitt has re-framed the\u000a      terms of the debate in\u000a      Scotland concerning participation of rape complainers in the criminal\u000a      justice system.

In\u000a      2008, based on her expertise in criminal evidence, particularly gender and\u000a      violence, Rape Crisis\u000a      Scotland (RCS) commissioned Raitt to conduct research into the use of\u000a      Independent Legal\u000a      Representation (ILR) for rape `complainers' (the Scottish term for those\u000a      who allege that they have\u000a      been the victim of a criminal offence). The report was commissioned\u000a      against a background in\u000a      Scotland of low reporting (90% of rapes are not reported to the police);\u000a      high attrition rates (the vast\u000a      majority of reported cases are not pursued to trial); and poor conviction\u000a      rates, such that in 2009,\u000a      Scotland had the lowest conviction rate in the EU, save for Ireland. The\u000a      key research questions\u000a      addressed were:\u000a    \u000a      What difference could ILR make to complainers' experiences?\u000a      Is ILR compatible with an adversarial trial system such as the\u000a        Scottish one?\u000a      Is ILR contrary to the principle of `equality of arms' enshrined in\u000a        the European Convention\u000a        on Human Rights (ECHR)?\u000a      Could a suitable model of ILR be designed for Scotland?\u000a    \u000a    The research report, Independent Legal Representation for Complainers\u000a        in Sexual Offence Trials,\u000a      was published by RCS in 2010 (http:\/\/www.rapecrisisscotland.org.uk\/publications\/research\/).\u000aThis\u000a      was a library based research activity, supplemented by interviews and\u000a      correspondence with\u000a      researchers and practitioners in other countries. It enabled the\u000a      construction of a comprehensive\u000a      contemporary framework of the ILR models that operate elsewhere to\u000a      evaluate the most suitable\u000a      model for the Scottish legal system. The research identified features of\u000a      Scottish criminal procedure\u000a      and evidence that exacerbate the problems currently facing rape\u000a      complainers and that shape the\u000a      type of responses the criminal justice system can make. Without ILR,\u000a      complainers, who are often\u000a      highly vulnerable, have no legally qualified person to support them or to\u000a      vindicate their interests\u000a      and rights. Other than the UK, almost all other countries in Europe permit\u000a      rape complainers to have\u000a      a lawyer to protect their rights, e.g. to privacy and compensation. The\u000a      research explored the\u000a      objections to ILR in countries with adversarial systems, such as Scotland,\u000a      and found that third\u000a      party representation of the type proposed in ILR is not necessarily\u000a      incompatible with the Scottish\u000a      system of investigation and prosecution. It considered the operation of\u000a      ILR in Canada and Ireland,\u000a      countries with similar legal systems to Scotland. Models could therefore\u000a      be designed to\u000a      accommodate third party representation in the courts. Raitt's research\u000a      highlighted the key\u000a      procedural stages where the intervention of ILR could significantly\u000a      improve the experience of the\u000a      complainer, and concluded that there were no insurmountable procedural or\u000a      evidential barriers to\u000a      its introduction in Scotland. This knowledge, and how it could be applied\u000a      in the Scottish legal\u000a      system to encourage reporting of rape and reduce attrition, has been used\u000a      by RCS to re-frame\u000a      recent and current debates in Scotland over further law reform.\u000a    Raitt conducted all the research between 2008 to date while employed at\u000a      the University of Dundee.\u000a      The research has led to numerous invitations to international conferences,\u000a      Scottish Government\u000a      events, and to contribute a chapter to an edited volume.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37292","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Temkin's work on the prevalence of rape myths in the legal process has\u000a      effected change in a\u000a      number of ways that mitigate the risks of stereotyping.

Temkin also set out the arguments for\u000a      retaining the present law,\u000a      which does not grant anonymity to defendants. Most of these arguments had\u000a      been missed in\u000a      the draft. She also set out the historical and psychological evidence.\u000a      [C2]\u000a    The final report concluded that there was not enough evidence to support\u000a      a change in the law in\u000a      accordance with Temkin's research findings; the consequence of this has\u000a      been that the law has\u000a      remained unchanged.\u000a    &#8226; Reshaping practitioners' attitudes\u000a    The primary end-users for Temkin's research are practice professionals\u000a      involved in the criminal\u000a      trial process for non-consensual sexual offences. These include judges,\u000a      barristers, solicitors\u000a      and a range of expert witnesses drawn from medical, psychological, social\u000a      work and police\u000a      professions. Temkin has undertaken training programmes for judges,\u000a      prosecutors and other\u000a      relevant professionals to highlight rape myths, as indicated below. The\u000a      training examined the\u000a      key role of attitudes to rape in the processing of rape cases by the\u000a      criminal justice system. In\u000a      particular it analyses rape myths, what they are and how they work. The\u000a      purpose of this is, first,\u000a      to encourage those involved in the processing of rape cases to examine\u000a      their own attitudes,\u000a      which may influence the way they handle rape cases. Second, the purpose is\u000a      to encourage the\u000a      challenging of rape myths when these are utilised by the defence in rape\u000a      cases. Members of the\u000a      public who sit on juries may well harbour stereotypical ideas about rape\u000a      and, if these\u000a      stereotypes are encouraged in rape trials, this may affect their outcome.\u000a      This type of education\u000a      is therefore geared towards achieving fairer results in rape cases.\u000a    Training programmes have included:\u000a    \u000a      `Rape Myths and their Implications', Sexuality and Sexual Health\u000a        Section, Royal Society of\u000a        Medicine, 14 March 2008.\u000a      `Sexual Offences and the Law', Royal College of Obstetricians and\u000a        Gynaecologists, Forensic\u000a        Gynaecology Training Conference 2009.\u000a      `Attitudes and the \"Justice Gap\": The Perennial Challenge of Effective\u000a        Change', Canadian\u000a        National Judicial Institute Seminar `Women and Girls and the Justice\u000a        System', Ottawa, 3\u000a        November 2009.\u000a      `The Myths and Stereotypes of Rape', Crown Prosecution Service, Rape\u000a        and Serious Sexual\u000a        Offences Training Courses, March, May, June, September and December\u000a        2009, December\u000a        2010.\u000a      `Tackling Rape Stereotypes within the Criminal Justice System',\u000a        keynote address, Division of\u000a        Forensic Psychology Annual Conference, University of Kent, 2010.\u000a    \u000a    Since 2010, Temkin has been a Member of the Board of the Diploma in the\u000a      Forensic and\u000a      Clinical Aspects of Sexual Assault (DFCASA), Society of Apothecaries of\u000a      London. The Diploma\u000a      is concerned with the training of the forensic medical examiners (FMEs)\u000a      who are responsible for\u000a      the medical examination of male and female sexual assault complainants who\u000a      report to the\u000a      police. These examinations are necessarily crucial to the legal process.\u000a      There has been\u000a      growing evidence that FMEs were inadequately trained and therefore failing\u000a      at this task.\u000a      Therefore the setting up of the Diploma to educate FMEs and raise the\u000a      standards of medical\u000a      examinations in this area was a very welcome development. The Board's task\u000a      was to assist in\u000a      the setting up of the Diploma by proffering advice and support. The\u000a      Diploma is research-based\u000a      so that the best treatment for victims can be given.

The\u000a      context for the research\u000a      was the persistently low conviction rate for sexual offences, despite\u000a      various legislative changes.\u000a      The key legal questions in relation to non-consensual sexual offences are\u000a      whether the complainant\u000a      in fact consented or whether the defendant had reasonable grounds to\u000a      believe that there had been\u000a      consent. The Temkin study investigated the possibility that it is\u000a      attitudes, rather than law, that need\u000a      to change before conviction rates might increase. In other words, myths\u000a      about `real' rapes could be\u000a      central to answering the crucial legal question of whether consent existed\u000a      in a particular case.\u000a    The research therefore addressed the extent to which stereotypes of what\u000a      `real' rape looks like can\u000a      influence all stages of the criminal process, from whether a rape is\u000a      reported in the first place right\u000a      through to whether a conviction ensues after a jury trial. Police\u000a      treatment of the victim may be\u000a      influenced by notions of what constitutes rape, as might be the decision\u000a      of the Crown Prosecution\u000a      Service, since the further away from the `real' stereotype the case seems\u000a      to be, then the less likely\u000a      may be the decision to prosecute. In court, barristers and judges may also\u000a      have their own reliance\u000a      on stereotypes and the members of the jury may form negative views of\u000a      victims from stereotyping\u000a      myths and, as a result, not find the defendant guilty. There is\u000a      accordingly a potential `justice gap'\u000a      between the number of reported rapes and the number of convictions that\u000a      might be explicable by\u000a      the effects of stereotypical perceptions of `real' rape (e.g. that rape\u000a      only occurs by a stranger,\u000a      outdoors, threatening or using violence upon a victim screaming and\u000a      struggling to escape and who\u000a      reports the attack immediately, or that there is no rape where the woman\u000a      has been drinking,\u000a      flirtatious or wears revealing clothing). Temkin's and Krahe's empirical\u000a      work was thus designed to\u000a      test the prevalence and effect of rape myths and stereotypes.\u000a    The research consisted of a number of studies:\u000a    \u000a      Law students (and thus part of the likely pool of lawyers for the\u000a        future) were asked to react to a\u000a        number of written sexual-assault scenarios. The results showed adherence\u000a        to the `real rape'\u000a        stereotyping in which, for example, the defendant was seen as less\u000a        blameworthy when the\u000a        parties knew each other.\u000a      A similar study was conducted with more than 2,000 members of the\u000a        public eligible for jury\u000a        service. Again there was conformity with the stereotyping thesis.\u000a      The research also tested the effectiveness of a Home Office poster\u000a        campaign aimed at\u000a        highlighting questions of consent. Temkin's research found that it made\u000a        no difference to\u000a        attitudes whether the sample group had seen or not seen the allegedly\u000a        hard-hitting posters. The\u000a        poster campaign, accordingly, was seen by the research as ineffective in\u000a        combating\u000a        stereotypical attitudes.\u000a      The final study consisted of qualitative interviews in which 17 judges\u000a        and 7 barristers were\u000a        asked to detail their own experiences of criminal trials and\u000a        stereotyping. These interviews\u000a        confirmed the prevalence of stereotypical views held by jurors &#8212; e.g. by\u000a        being over-sceptical\u000a        about women who allowed men they had just met to see them home or who\u000a        had inconsistent\u000a        recall about events or who had taken time to complain.\u000a    \u000a    On the basis of this project, Temkin and Krahe made a number of\u000a      recommendations relating to law\u000a      reform and changes in trial processes, and called for more training of\u000a      judges and barristers\u000a      together with a media campaign starting at school level, to educate the\u000a      public about rape myths.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37312","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The `Longer view of contact' project has received widespread attention,\u000d\u000a      especially in the context of proposed legislative reform.

It demonstrates the\u000a        importance of basing decisions about contact on the specific\u000d\u000a        circumstances of each child, allowing for arrangements to be\u000d\u000a      flexible and evolve. Critically, the research shows that children were\u000d\u000a      often very clear about their own needs, that their involvement in\u000d\u000a      decision-making is associated with positive contact experiences, and that,\u000d\u000a      if children resist contact with non-resident parents, it is often for\u000d\u000a      their own reasons and related to the behaviour of the non-resident parent.\u000d\u000a    Caroline Willow, former National Coordinator of the Children's Rights\u000d\u000a      Alliance for England, noted that the research influenced debates on\u000d\u000a      `shared parenting' during the reading of the Bill, in particular eliciting\u000d\u000a      comments from Liberal Democrat for Home Affairs Baroness Hamwee and\u000d\u000a      Baroness Butler-Sloss [C6].\u000d\u000a    In a letter to the University from a leading practitioner in the field,\u000d\u000a      Alistair MacDonald QC, it is stated, among other things, `It is plain that\u000d\u000a      the research conducted by Professor Fortin has already had, and will\u000d\u000a      continue to have, a positive impact on policy and practice in the field of\u000d\u000a      law relating to children' [C5].\u000d\u000a    In an email to the University, Sir James Munby, President of the Family\u000d\u000a      Division of the Judiciary, states, among other things, that Professor\u000d\u000a      Fortin's research described herein `was of great practical importance to\u000d\u000a      judges and legal and other practitioners in the family justice system'\u000d\u000a      and, in the context of this impact audience, Sir James Munby also says the\u000d\u000a      research's message `has been absorbed by everyone and has influenced many\u000d\u000a      people's thinking' [C3].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research investigating the long-term impact of child contact arrangements\u000d\u000a      in the context of parental separation under the existing law has rapidly\u000d\u000a      and demonstrably impacted upon Parliamentary discussion, policy setting\u000d\u000a      and recommendations by the Children's Commissioner, upon the strategies of\u000d\u000a      cross-disciplinary groups of family justice practitioners who deal with\u000d\u000a      children's issues, and in judicial practice, such that prior presumptions\u000d\u000a      in relation to child contact have altered.

The research study drew on the findings of\u000d\u000a      an earlier pilot study led by Fortin [R2] which had demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      research with young adults on this aspect of parental breakdown produced\u000d\u000a      particularly rich research data.\u000d\u000a    The Nuffield project examined the experience of children dealing with\u000d\u000a      parental separation. Traditionally, separation has resulted in one parent\u000d\u000a      becoming the primary carer whilst the other becomes the contact parent. At\u000d\u000a      the time of the research project's conception there was intense political\u000d\u000a      debate around the question of promoting greater involvement of\u000d\u000a      non-resident parents in children's lives. The research gap addressed by\u000d\u000a      the project comprised a comprehensive investigation of the long-term\u000d\u000a      impact of contact arrangements under the existing law.\u000d\u000a    The research had two principal objectives. First, to give voice to a\u000d\u000a      group of people hitherto largely ignored, i.e. the young adults who had\u000d\u000a      been the subject of contact arrangements during their childhood. Second,\u000d\u000a      to investigate whether the young adults' evaluations of contact were\u000d\u000a      associated with any particular characteristics of contact, their\u000d\u000a      involvement in contact decisions, and the nature and extent of contact\u000d\u000a      problems (including safety concerns and exposure to parental conflict).\u000d\u000a    The study consisted of two parts:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      First, a telephone survey of young adults in England and Wales who\u000d\u000a        experienced the break-up of their parents' relationship before they\u000d\u000a        reached the age of 16. Participants were screened and then interviewed\u000d\u000a        using the Quancept Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing system.\u000d\u000a      The second stage of the study consisted of in-depth, face-to-face\u000d\u000a        interviews with a subgroup of young adults. These were selected on the\u000d\u000a        basis of two criteria: (i) that parental separation had occurred after\u000d\u000a        implementation of the Children Act 1989 (because this substantially\u000d\u000a        changed the law) and (ii) that they had had some contact with the\u000d\u000a        non-resident parent.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Key findings from the project included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Children are independent social actors. Children's own involvement in\u000d\u000a        decisions about contact is associated with positive contact experiences.\u000d\u000a        Children are not brainwashed into resisting contact with non-resident\u000d\u000a        parents but are able to form clear and mature views as to their own\u000d\u000a        needs.\u000d\u000a      In principle, a continuing relationship with both parents is vitally\u000d\u000a        important. This emerged as a view, at least in principle, held even by\u000d\u000a        those with bad experiences of contact. However, it was also clear that\u000d\u000a        no contact was seen as better than bad contact.\u000d\u000a      The ingredients of successful contact: continuous contact; a good\u000d\u000a        pre-separation relationship with the non-resident parent; efforts made\u000d\u000a        by the non-resident parent to maintain an enjoyable contact; and the\u000d\u000a        commitment demonstrated by the non-resident parent.\u000d\u000a      The relative unimportance of the amount or type of contact; there is\u000d\u000a        no blueprint for contact which will work for all, or the majority of,\u000d\u000a        children.\u000d\u000a      Resident parents are more likely to facilitate than to undermine\u000d\u000a        contact.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The research highlighted significant implications for courts and\u000d\u000a      policy-makers. In particular, it identified a number of risks that would\u000d\u000a      be associated with proposed legislation seeking to embed a presumption\u000d\u000a      about the involvement of both parents in the life of the child. Fortin's\u000d\u000a      research strongly suggested that courts should retain unfettered\u000d\u000a      discretions about the welfare of the child and should be able to focus on\u000d\u000a      individual needs.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38394","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Maruna's strategy for maximising the impact of his research has involved\u000a      a) frequent high-level\u000a      contributions to practice-oriented events, including the Annual Perrie\u000a      Lecture for HM Prison\u000a      Service (2010) and the 18th Annual Edith Kahn Memorial Lecture\u000a      at the House of Lords (Lords\u000a        Hansard, 692\/100); b) the production of accessible materials and\u000a      tools based on his research,\u000a      such as a brief summary of desistance research, commissioned by the\u000a      National Offender\u000a      Management Service (NOMS) for distribution throughout all prisons and\u000a      probation trusts in\u000a      England and Wales and across Europe by the Conference on European\u000a      Probation; and, c) direct\u000a      engagement with agencies, including appointments to the two UK bodies &#8212;\u000a      the \"Correctional\u000a      Services Accreditation and Advice Panel\" and the \"Scottish Accreditation\u000a      Panel for Offender\u000a      Rehabilitation\" &#8212; charged with assessing all new rehabilitative\u000a      interventions across the UK.\u000a    The impact of Maruna's research has been the transformation of\u000a      rehabilitation practice in the UK\u000a      and beyond. The Director General of the National Offender Management\u000a      Service (NOMS &#8212; with\u000a      responsibility for every prison and probation area in England and Wales\u000a      from 2005 to 2010) writes\u000a      that as a result of Maruna's research \"we changed the emphasis in both\u000a        prison and probation to try\u000a        and maximise the opportunities to encourage and sustain desistance from\u000a        crime. The changes\u000a          were to messaging, staff training and to prison regime design plus a\u000a          major programme of\u000a          change in probation called the Offender Engagement Programme\"\u000a      (Document on file). The\u000a      Commissioning &amp; Commercial Director at NOMS with responsibility for\u000a      the NOMS Competition\u000a      Programme currently competing over &#163;2.5bn of services, writes: \"Shadd's\u000a        research sits on a very\u000a        short list of key individuals who in the past decade have made the most\u000a        significant impact on and\u000a        have influenced and shaped the policies and practices for offender\u000a        services in the UK.\" Indeed,\u000a      Maruna's research featured strongly in the Ministry of Justice's 2011\u000a      Green Paper announcing the\u000a      initial plans for the Coalition Government's \"rehabilitation revolution\"\u000a      from 2011 (Sect 5).\u000a    Further, the NOMS Commissioning Intentions document which sets\u000a      out the framework for the\u000a      rehabilitative services it will fund, explicitly refers to the work\u000a      pioneered by Maruna that supports\u000a      desistance. The Head of Evidence and Offence Specialism at NOMS writes: \"The\u000a        evidence base\u000a        for what services we commission for prisoners and probationers...has\u000a        been particularly informed\u000a        by the understanding of desistance from Shadd's work\". The NOMS Guide\u000a        for Working with\u000a        Female Offenders also states explicitly that \"Shadd Maruna's work\u000a        (2010)... provides insights and\u000a        strategies that are highly pertinent when working with women offenders\"\u000a      (Sect. 5). In The\u000a        Probation Journal, Eleanor Fellowes of London Probation (2012)\u000a      wrote: \"The rolling out of new\u000a        National Standards can be seen as an explicit adoption of the invaluable\u000a        lessons of desistance\u000a        research, indeed the file I received as part of my induction into the\u000a        new model contained two\u000a        articles on the subject by Shadd Maruna (2010), Fergus McNeill and Beth\u000a        Weaver (2010)\" (Sect.\u000a      5). The Governor of HM Grendon Prison, an internationally renowned\u000a      therapeutic prison in\u000a      England, writes: \"Professor Maruna's work has been widely discussed in\u000a        prisons... has permeated\u000a        into the strategic development of prisons ... and enabled the\u000a          maintenance and promotion of a\u000a          humane and empathetic approach to prisoner management\" (Letter\u000a      in QUB REF Archive).\u000a      Indeed, in 2011, Maruna was awarded the inaugural Howard League\u000a        Research Medal for work that\u000a      \"makes an impact and changes penal policy and practice through high\u000a      quality research.\"\u000a    One specific area of impact has been in the creation of formal rituals\u000a      certifying steps toward\u000a      behavioural change following Maruna's (2011) analysis. For example, in\u000a      Durham probation\u000a      departments, progression toward rehabilitation is \"now formally\u000a      recognised\" drawing heavily on\u000a      \"Maruna's research on the importance of ritual and ceremony in desistance\"\u000a      (Document on file).\u000a      Likewise, the Governor of HM Grendon Prison writes: \"Having read an\u000a        article Professor Maruna\u000a        published regarding 'desistance reinforcing rituals'... led to the\u000a        setting up of a group of residents\u000a        and staff to review this and pilot a new approach. As a result a new\u000a        process of 'graduation' was\u000a        introduced where those completing therapy were presented with a\u000a        certificate with an audience of\u000a        their fellow community members ... family members or friends. ... This\u000a        ... important enhancement\u000a        to our therapeutic process and was directly inspired by Professor\u000a        Maruna's work\".\u000a    Maruna's research has also changed the focus of offender therapy from\u000a      correcting cognitive\u000a      deficits to promoting individual strengths. The Head of NOMS' Dangerous\u000a      Offenders Section\u000a      writes: \"Maruna's research on cognitive distortions has also changed\u000a        how facilitators of sexual\u000a        offender treatment programmes approach and address the cognitive\u000a        distortions of such offenders\"\u000a      (Letter in Archive). Likewise, the Head of Research and Offence Specialism\u000a      at NOMS states: \"Our\u000a        new programmes are significantly more focused on positive targets such\u000a        as social capital. ... This\u000a        shift was directly caused by Shadd's work on ... strengths-based\u000a        rehabilitation. We have also\u000a        developed a new tool for monitoring the acute risk ... focused on\u000a        monitoring men's strengths as\u000a        much as their deficits. Again we chose to take this focus because of\u000a        Shadd's work on strengths-based\u000a\u0009\u0009rehabilitation\" (Letter in Archive).\u000a    This impact has also manifested itself directly in a number of new\u000a      programmes for prisoners\u000a      explicitly based on Maruna's research. His research was the primary basis\u000a      for the development of\u000a      a new rehabilitative intervention known as the \"Belief in Change\u000a      Programme\" piloted at HMP\u000a      Channings Wood. The Head of Dangerous Offenders Section for NOMS writes\u000a      that \"Maruna's\u000a        work on desistance, reintegration rituals and strengths based approaches\u000a        has been incorporated\u000a        into the design and development of various interventions such as the\u000a        Healthy Identity Intervention\u000a        for extremist offenders\" (Letter in Archive). HM High Down Prison in\u000a      the East of England has\u000a      declared itself a \"Desistance Prison\" and invited Maruna to conduct a\u000a      \"desistance audit\" of all\u000a      aspects of the prison in 2011. Avon Somerset Probation Trust (ASPT) has\u000a      created a post of\u000a      \"Desistance Development Officer\"; her report Supporting Desistance in\u000a        Avon and Somerset\u000a        Probation has 75 citations to Maruna's research (on file). Maruna's\u000a      work is also explicitly cited as\u000a      foundational for the Good Lives Programme for offenders in Scotland in\u000a      both the programme and\u000a      theory manuals (on file). The Chief Executive of the St. Giles Trust,\u000a      London, argues that his highly\u000a      successful organisation is the \"living and breathing\" embodiment of\u000a      desistance theory: \"Shadd\u000a        Maruna is a pilgrim in making desistance theory not so much a theory but\u000a        a mainstreamed\u000a        practice. ... Fascinatingly the most enlightened civil servants in our\u000a        field, and there are some with\u000a        immense intellect and understanding, are all huge Shadd Maruna fans\"\u000a      (Letter in Archive). Maruna\u000a      was named a patron of the ex-offender charity UNLOCK and has provided a\u000a      strategic framework\u000a      for that organisations policy advocacy strategy. In 2007, Maruna was\u000a      commissioned, with Tim\u000a      Chapman, to revise the National Outcomes and Standards for Criminal\u000a      Justice Social Work\u000a      Services for Scotland, and he also produced a substantial report for the\u000a      Northern Ireland Office on\u000a      \"what works\" in reducing offending in advance of the devolution of\u000a      criminal justice in Northern\u000a      Ireland. As a result of the latter, the NI Department of Justice has made\u000a      desistance a central\u000a      organizing concept for its Strategic Framework for Reducing Offending,\u000a      citing Maruna's research\u000a      prominently (Sect 5).\u000a    The impact of this research extends beyond the UK. In a survey of 1,379\u000a      offender treatment\u000a      programmes across North America, The Safer Society Foundation found that\u000a      around 28% of\u000a      programmes said they were incorporating \"good lives\" approaches into their\u000a      work (McGrath, 2010,\u000a      below). The US Department of Justice, recently developed a $1.5 million\u000a      pilot test of the\u000a      desistance model explicitly \"based on Maruna's (2010) trans-theoretical\u000a      model.\" Maruna's findings\u000a      were instrumental in the establishment of the first mutual aid\u000a      organisation for ex-prisoners in\u000a      Japan, the Pathway Prisoner Reintegration Programme in New Zealand, and a\u000a      restoration ritual for\u000a      individuals completing parole held in Hawaii's State Supreme Court.\u000a      Maruna's research has been\u000a      the central organising theory for a federally-funded network of community\u000a      justice centres in the\u000a      state of Vermont and a system of \"halfway house\" interventions in\u000a      Connecticut. Maruna's research\u000a      has also been influential in Singapore where the psychology unit for the\u000a      prison service has adopted\u000a      an explicitly \"desistance-based\" approach (Day and Casey 2012). Likewise,\u000a      Maruna has been\u000a      invited to consult in Chile, where his ideas are now part of core\u000a      practices across several\u000a      organisations. Paz Ciudadana have drawn directly upon Maruna's theoretical\u000a      ideas in the drug\u000a      treatment courts in Chile, and FASCO have designed the \"first after-prison\u000a      project that has been\u000a      systematised and assessed in Chile\" drawing explicitly on Professor\u000a      Maruna's work.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Traditionally offender rehabilitation has been understood as a top-down\u000a      process through which\u000a      deficits are `corrected'. Maruna is the primary source of a\u000a      `strengths-based' or `good lives'\u000a      approach to rehabilitation. This is based on his research into how\u000a      individuals successfully desist\u000a      from crime of their own volition. The reach and significance of Maruna's\u000a      research is demonstrated\u000a      by surveys of those professionals involved in rehabilitation which suggest\u000a      that this approach now\u000a      underpins the practice of up to one quarter of treatment interventions\u000a      internationally (McGrath et al\u000a      2010). The US Department of Justice (2011) has recently funded a $1.5\u000a      million pilot test of\u000a      \"desistance theory\" explicitly \"based on Maruna's trans-theoretical model\"\u000a      (see Section 5, below).\u000a      This approach has also been widely adopted in England and Wales. As the\u000a      Director responsible for\u000a      commissioning all prison and probation services there comments: \"I can\u000a        with confidence say that\u000a        research carried out by Shadd Maruna into desistance from crime has\u000a        significantly impacted both\u000a        policy and operational practice, ... and is shaping the culture and\u000a        service delivery models of\u000a        providers across all aspects of the offender services market\"\u000a      (Letter, Commissioning and\u000a      Commercial Director NOMS, in QUB REF Archive, see Sect 5).\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    Queen's University Belfast\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen's University Belfast","InstitutionName":"Queen's University Belfast","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Northern Ireland","UKPRN":10005343}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"4831725","Name":"Connecticut"},{"GeoNamesId":"5242283","Name":"Vermont"},{"GeoNamesId":"5855797","Name":"Hawaii"}],"References":"\u000a    Since 2008, Maruna's work has been cited over 3000 times (Google Scholar)\u000a      making him one of\u000a      the most cited criminologists currently working in the discipline.

This\u000a      is the study of how and\u000a      why some individuals are able to move away from criminal behaviour after\u000a      long patterns of\u000a      criminality. This research differs from traditional rehabilitation\u000a      research which asks \"what works\" in\u000a      treatment programmes by comparing the recidivism outcomes between groups\u000a      in treatment and\u000a      control groups. Desistance research instead seeks to understand how the\u000a      process of personal\u000a      reform works by understanding the developmental pathways of individual\u000a      lives in social and\u000a      cultural context. Maruna's recent desistance research has included a\u000a      10-year longitudinal study of\u000a      the life trajectories of a sample of recidivist property offenders\u000a      beginning during their incarceration\u000a      and including multiple waves of data collection post-release (e.g., LeBel,\u000a      Burnett, Maruna &amp;\u000a      Bushway, 2008 &#8212; REF2). In this work, he has sought to better understand\u000a      the cognitive changes\u000a      that are related to desistance from crime and how these relate (or often\u000a      contradict) the goals of\u000a      correctional treatment delivered in the name of therapy (e.g., Maruna\u000a      &amp; Mann, 2006). He has also\u000a      explored the \"flip side\" of reintegration, examining community attitudes\u000a      to prisoner reintegration\u000a      (and their beliefs in individual `redeemability' of some offenders) and\u000a      seeking to understand how to\u000a      better work with communities in this process (e.g., Maruna &amp; King,\u000a      2009 &#8212; REF2). One key, recent\u000a      strand of this research has explored the dynamics of rituals and\u000a      ceremonies in recognising steps\u000a      toward behavioural change and countering the stigma that ex-prisoners\u000a      experience (e.g., Maruna,\u000a      2011). Through all of this work, Maruna and colleagues have developed a\u000a      widely adopted model of\u000a      offender rehabilitation practice (e.g., Maruna &amp; LeBel, 2010; Ward\u000a      &amp; Maruna, 2007) that has\u000a      challenged traditional \"deficit-based\" approaches to offender treatment\u000a      (that focus on the\u000a      assessment and targeting of risk factors) with an engagement-oriented\u000a      \"strengths-based\" approach\u000a      focused on promoting \"good lives\" based on reparation and \"making good\"\u000a      (see House of\u000a      Commons, 2012, Sect 5).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38395","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the research is as follows.\u000a    The IRA ceasefire of 1994 specified a cessation of `military operations'\u000a      only &#8212; i.e. punishment\u000a      violence against alleged anti-social offenders continued. Between 1973 and\u000a      2007 Republicans\u000a      were responsible for approximately 1570 such shootings and over 1000\u000a      beatings (PSNI 2010). In\u000a      1994 McEvoy and three human rights activists began direct dialogue with\u000a      the IRA to explore non-violent\u000a      alternatives to such practices. Following intensive negotiations with\u000a      senior IRA members, a\u000a      research report written by the team was presented to the Republican\u000a      leadership (Auld et al 1997 &#8212; the `Blue Book'). That document mapped out a route for the IRA to\u000a      `responsibly disengage' from\u000a      punishment violence. It proposed the creation of local CRJ projects which\u000a      would instead deal with\u000a      crime and anti-social behaviour using non-violent and lawful restorative\u000a      justice techniques. It also\u000a      suggested that relations between the police and Republican communities\u000a      could be gradually\u000a      improved through such projects. In late 1997, Sinn F&#233;in President Gerry\u000a      Adams announced that,\u000a      following extensive consultation with `external experts' (i.e. McEvoy et\u000a      al), Sinn F&#233;in would support\u000a      the establishment of CRJ as an alternative to IRA punishment violence. The\u000a      IRA subsequently\u000a      issued a series of statements, also confirming its support for the\u000a      initiative (press statements in\u000a      QUB REF archive). Four pilot projects were established in 1998. McEvoy\u000a      became a Board member\u000a      of the newly formed organisation Community Restorative Justice Ireland\u000a      (CRJI) and remains one.\u000a    The International Monitoring Commission (IMC), a body established by the\u000a      British and Irish\u000a      governments to assess the paramilitary ceasefires, concluded that while\u000a      one death occurred as a\u000a      result of a punishment beating in late 2007 involving IRA members, it was\u000a      un-authorised. In 2009\u000a      the IMC further concluded that the IRA remained `on an exclusive\u000a        political path' and `where\u000a        individuals have engaged in violence or other crime (including against\u000a        perceived anti-social\u000a        behaviour) we believe they did so without sanction' (IMC 2009:10). In\u000a        effect, no IRA sanctioned\u000a        punishment violence has occurred between 2008 and 2013. At the time\u000a      of writing (2013) there are\u000a      now five projects operational in Belfast, one in Newry\/South Armagh and a\u000a      further four in the Derry\u000a      area, processing approximately 1300 cases per year.\u000a    Given that the origins of the restorative justice projects lay in\u000a      dialogue with the IRA, they have been\u000a      the subject of extensive external review (e.g. Criminal Justice\u000a      Inspectorate NI 2008, 2011). As\u000a      evidenced by these inspection reports, the quality and value of their work\u000a      is now widely accepted.\u000a      [text removed for publication] also attest that ending punishment violence\u000a      would not have\u000a      happened without McEvoy's research. As Harry Maguire, [text removed for\u000a      publication] (convicted\u000a      of the murder of two British Army Corporals at an IRA funeral in 1988 and\u000a      released early under the\u000a      Good Friday Agreement) and current Community Restorative Justice Ireland\u000a      Director confirmed\u000a      (letter);\u000a    \"It was the process which Professor McEvoy and his colleagues engaged\u000a        in with Republicans &#8212;\u000a        known locally as the `Blue Book Process' &#8212; which ultimately led to the\u000a        creation of CRJI and the\u000a        creation of a non-violent alternative to punishment violence... the\u000a        Republican Movement could not\u000a        have delivered an end to punishment violence without having something\u000a        there in its place.\u000a        Community Restorative Justice was that alternative &#8212; a responsible and\u000a        progressive response to\u000a        crime and anti-social behaviour based upon restorative justice. Of\u000a        course it required the\u000a        commitment of our activists to implement it, but the Blue Book written\u000a        by McEvoy and his\u000a        colleagues was the road map to the IRA ending punishment violence...\u000a        McEvoy's subsequent\u000a        research conducted on restorative justice, practice standards, human\u000a        rights protections, the role of\u000a        combatants and former combatants in peace-making and how to work with\u000a        the police while\u000a        retaining our community credibility has been absolutely crucial to the\u000a        successful development of\u000a        Community Restorative Justice in the North of Ireland, and to our\u000a        efforts to improve relations with\u000a        the PSNI. We couldn't have done all of this without him, simple as\u000a        that.\"\u000a    Other than the engagement with the IRA and the involvement of [text removed for publication] as\u000a      staff and volunteers on the project, the other most challenging aspect of\u000a      these initiatives has been\u000a      their relationship with the formal justice system in general and the\u000a      police in particular. The\u000a      historically poor relationships between sections of the\u000a      Catholic\/Nationalist community and the\u000a      police was a key driver for the reform process instituted by the\u000a      Independent Commission on\u000a      Policing chaired by Lord Patten. While a political deal on policing was\u000a      eventually concluded in May\u000a      2007 when Sinn F&#233;in took its seats on the Policing Board, both the police\u000a      and Republican leaders\u000a      emphasised that the quality and durability of the relationship between the\u000a      PSNI and Republican\u000a      communities would be judged by events on the ground. Again successive\u000a      reports by the Criminal\u000a      Justice Inspectorate for Northern Ireland (CJINI), which are required in\u000a      order for the projects to\u000a      continue to receive mainstream statutory funding, have documented the\u000a      centrality of the CRJ\u000a      projects in developing good relationships with the Police (2008, 2011). As\u000a      one recent CJINI report\u000a      indicated \"Inspectors were told by senior police officers in West\u000a        Belfast and Derry\/Londonderry that\u000a        they regard Community Restorative Justice Ireland as the\u000a          single most important relationship they\u000a          have in reaching out to the previously estranged or hard to reach\u000a          republican\/nationalist\u000a          communities living in those areas\" (CJINI 2011:11).\u000a      McEvoy's research has been identified by the\u000a      police as central to this impact. As former RUC Assistant Chief Constable\u000a      Stephen White OBE\u000a      confirmed (letter);\u000a    \"It is to his [McEvoy's] great credit and perseverance that today his\u000a        RJ efforts are widely\u000a        recognised as having been a major success in persuading the IRA to end\u000a        community\u000a        punishments... [A]nother major benefit which flowed from his work is the\u000a        promotion of better\u000a        relations with the police through CRJ. Due to his personal and\u000a        professional efforts the progress\u000a        made in the area of community and police relationships has been truly\u000a        remarkable...The fact that\u000a        projects which have been spawned directly from his work include many\u000a        prominent former members\u000a        of the IRA, an organisation that spent 25 years trying to kill police\u000a        officers is, quite simply, a cause\u000a        for celebration...This work is of major strategic significance to the\u000a        police...the PSNI recognised\u000a        that they needed partners in Republican communities. Those partners had\u000a        to have local credibility\u000a        but often their past made it difficult for the police. The solution was\u000a        to focus on the work within the\u000a        projects and demonstrate that it was of high quality, lawful, human\u000a        rights compliant and\u000a        internationally and nationally respectable. That is where the research\u000a        done by Professor McEvoy\u000a        was a key factor. His research located these developments in the\u000a        international context and\u000a        provided a vision as to how, within CRJ projects, relations between the\u000a        police and the communities\u000a        could develop in the interests of both...In short, his research and\u000a        reputation helped give the police\u000a        the confidence to engage and to develop relationships on the ground...\u000a        In 2012 I agreed to join the\u000a        Board of Community Restorative Justice. I now sit on that Board with\u000a        former IRA activists, helping\u000a        to further enhance police community relations in local Republican\u000a        communities, largely because of\u000a        Professor McEvoy and his work.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact here relates to Kieran McEvoy's research on the development of\u000a      Community\u000a      Restorative Justice (CRJ) in Northern Ireland.

Further\u000a      research (McEvoy and Mika\u000a      2002) articulated the continued complex causes of punishment violence and\u000a      the challenges for all\u000a      in moving away from deeply embedded cultures of violence; the need to\u000a      balance human rights\u000a      compliant standards of policy and practice in community based projects\u000a      against excessive legalism\u000a      (McEvoy 2007); the leadership skills of former combatants in such\u000a      peace-making work (McEvoy\u000a      and Shirlow 2009, REF OUTPUT 2); the requirements from former IRA\u000a      activists, the community\u000a      and the police for a more effective working partnership (McEvoy and\u000a      Eriksson 2008); and the\u000a      lessons to be gleaned from this work with the IRA by human rights\u000a      activists elsewhere regarding\u000a      engagement with armed groups (Dudai and McEvoy 2012). As is evidenced\u000a      below, the practical\u000a      impact of the implementation of this research are that (i) No IRA\u000a      punishment attacks have occurred\u000a      since 2007; (ii) the capacity and credibility of the CRJI projects\u000a      is widely accepted and (iii)\u000a      relations between Republican communities and the police have improved\u000a      dramatically.\u000a    A number of important insights emerged from the research. (i) It\u000a      is possible to engage directly with\u000a      armed groups and affect their behaviour through research and practice\u000a      grounded in human rights\u000a      and restorative justice. (ii) Deeply embedded cultures of violence\u000a      can be challenged and\u000a      ameliorated through careful, well planned, politically nuanced\u000a      community-based programmes\u000a      underpinned by good research and policy work. (iii) Former\u000a      paramilitaries, if appropriately\u000a      resourced and motivated, can become key leaders in grass-roots conflict\u000a      transformation. (iv)\u000a      Restorative justice theory and practice can be both adaptable and\u000a      effective in community-led\u000a      programmes and delivered in a human rights-compliant manner (v)\u000a      State agencies may have to\u000a      accept a more balanced notion of `real partnership' when co-working with\u000a      well run, assertive and\u000a      confident community organisations. (vi) The police and other\u000a      criminal justice agencies can deliver\u000a      more effective crime prevention and policing as a result. (vii)\u000a      Other societies emerging from\u000a      conflict should be wary of the related dangers of excessive legalism and\u000a      state-centricity, cognisant\u000a      of the role and capacity of grassroots justice organisations and open to\u000a      direct engagement with\u000a      armed groups for peace-making ends.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38396","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2275384","Name":"Liberia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1512440","Name":"Uzbekistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Background\u000a    Prior to Allain's research, the 1926 definition of slavery had not\u000a      previously been utilised by courts of law. Following the introduction of\u000a      the 1926 definition, Slavery was only utilised by the League of Nations\u000a      against non-Members, in particular Liberia and Ethiopia. It was deemed not\u000a      to be applicable to Western states because colonial practices were instead\u000a      termed `forced labour'. In the early years of the United Nations, newly\u000a      independent states attempted to argue that colonialism and apartheid\u000a      should be regarded as slavery. These efforts were negated by Western\u000a      States. As a result of this stalemate at the international level, slavery\u000a      was not considered by courts from 1926 onwards [6].\u000a    It was only after the year 2000, as a result of developments in\u000a      international criminal law, most notably the establishment of the\u000a      International Criminal Court and a number of anti-trafficking conventions,\u000a      that the early 21st Century saw courts trying slavery cases for the first\u000a      time. However, in the absence of a clear historical understanding of the\u000a      concept, in 2002 and 2005 the European Court of Human Rights and the\u000a      International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) came to\u000a      diametrically opposed views as to the definition of `slavery'.\u000a    The Director of the UK-based leading international anti-slavery NGO,\u000a      Anti-Slavery International, Aidan McQuade, has noted that there was \"a\u000a        fundamental conceptual issue at the heart of focus of Anti-Slavery. The\u000a        very notion of `slavery' was contested, having no true settled meaning.\u000a        This has caused discrepancies in reporting parameters, confusion in\u000a        advocacy and difficulty in bring awareness to the general public\".\u000a      With the notion of slavery re-emerging as an important legal, political\u000a      and social phenomenon, Allain's research (as attested below) has become\u000a      the benchmark for any discussion as to what constitutes contemporary\u000a      slavery.\u000a    The reach and significance of the impact of his research is evident\u000a      across three areas; in the courts, in the world of NGO activism, and in\u000a      the policy\\funding community.\u000a    Legal Impact\u000a    Allain's research has become a central reference point in the courts. By\u000a      way of illustration, in 2008 Allain was contacted by the Australian Human\u000a      Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, asking whether he had any new\u000a      material relating to his research on slavery as they were contemplating\u000a      intervening in a case before the supreme court of Australia (known as `the\u000a      High Court of Australia'). Allain provided the Commission with an advanced\u000a      copy of his book The Slavery Conventions. On the basis of Allain's\u000a      legislative history of the 1926 and 1956 Slavery Conventions, the\u000a      Commission intervened[i].\u000a    In its ground-breaking 2008 judgment in the case (Tang), the High\u000a      Court agreed with Allain's view on the definition of slavery. Allain's\u000a      work is discussed in some detail in the intervention (paras 38- 47), in\u000a      the oral proceedings (pages 59-68, 94-103, 110-111, 124-125) and in the\u000a      judgement (paras 25-26, 33-34). As the transcript demonstrates, Allain's\u000a      test for establishing whether or not slavery exists in a specific\u000a      situation was discussed [ii] and later utilised by the Court in its\u000a      judgement. The High Court noted that it \"is important not to debase the\u000a        currency of language, or to banalise crimes against humanity, by giving\u000a        slavery a meaning that extends beyond the limits set by the text,\u000a        context, and purpose of the 1926 Slavery Convention. In particular it is\u000a        important to recognise that harsh and exploitative conditions of labour\u000a        do not of themselves amount to slavery. The term \"slave\" is sometimes\u000a        used in a metaphorical sense to describe victims of such conditions\".\u000a      The Court continued, by stating that in all countries of the world \"legal\u000a        ownership of a person is impossible\", but that the 1926 definition\u000a      was also \"concerned with de facto slavery\". The High Court of\u000a      Australia then cited Allain's research, and set out the legal test for\u000a      determining contemporary slavery that of \"effective (although not\u000a        legal, for that is impossible) ownership\" [iii].\u000a    As a result of the Tang judgement underpinned and justified by\u000a      Allain's research, individuals are being prosecuted and found guilty of\u000a      enslavement. Before the arguments and subsequent decision in Tang,\u000a      nobody in Australia had even been tried for slavery. Between 2008 and 2013\u000a      there have been six cases which have percolated up to the appellant level,\u000a      while dozens of cases have been tried to conviction in lower courts [iv].\u000a    Civil Society and Policy Impact\u000a    In addition to his influence in the legal arena, Allain has also had\u000a      significant impact in the civil society and policy community, particularly\u000a      in underpinning the lobbying and advocacy work of NGOs. He is lead author\u000a      on the Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines on the Legal Parameters of Slavery.\u000a      These guidelines were originally written to offer an accessible but\u000a      legally accurate guide to the 1926 definition of slavery for use in the\u000a      courts. However, in part because they were written as part of a\u000a      collaborative process with key activists and organisations in the field,\u000a      they have become the central template around which such organisation\u000a      construct their lobbying and advocacy work concerning the lived experience\u000a      of contemporary slaves. Kevin Bales (Co-founder of Free the Slaves, the\u000a      leading US-based anti-slavery NGO) has stated: \"It is hard to convey\u000a        just how important this achievement is today and is likely to be in the\u000a        future. In a fundamental way Allain's definitional guidelines have built\u000a        a solid bridge between law and reality, between policy and action\"\u000a      [vi]. In a similar vein, McQuade, of Anti-Slavery International,\u000a      has summed up Allain's contribution by saying: \"Allain's research has\u000a        given a solid foundation to our work at Anti-Slavery\".\u000a    McQuade goes on to say that Allain's research on the definition of\u000a      slavery has had fundamental and wide ranging impact beyond his\u000a      Organisation: \"this definition which had not been utilised previously\u000a        is now the benchmark which informs not only Anti-Slavery's work, but\u000a        increasingly all research, social policy, and advocacy around modern-day\u000a        slavery\" [v].\u000a    Funding Impact\u000a    Allain's research is also the foundation upon which a global movement to\u000a      eradicate slavery is based. That movement is an initiative of the\u000a      philanthropist Andrew Forrest, who has partnered with the likes of Bill\u000a      Gates, Richard Branson and others, to seek to achieve the stated aim of\u000a      `eradicating slavery in our life-time' (see: http:\/\/www.walkfree.org\/).\u000a    An initial part of the work of this initiative has been to document the\u000a      prevalence of contemporary slavery worldwide. Of course to make such a\u000a      determination the Walkfree initiative needed to have an agreed\u000a      definition of what constitutes slavery. Walkfree have adopted the\u000a      Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines as its working definition of slavery\u000a      and is producing what is term the annual Global Slavery Index, which\u000a      estimates the prevalence of slavery in 162 countries. The value of that\u000a      base-line data &#8212; based on Allain's underpinning research &#8212; is, as the\u000a      Attorney General of Canada has made plain, in its capacity to \" improve\u000a        information sharing and raise greater awareness and provide policy\u000a        makers with the foundation they need to prevent and eradicate human\u000a        rights violations\" [vi].\u000a    The Index is part of a broader four-pronged strategy that also includes a\u000a      popular movement, business-to-business pressure and the Global Fund for\u000a      the Eradication of Slavery. While the initiative is in its infancy, it has\u000a      already had a number of conspicuous successes. For example, it has been\u000a      successful in getting Inditex SA, the world's largest clothing retailer,\u000a      to stop using cotton picked by forced labourers in Uzbekistan and helping\u000a      Philippine activists pressure their Senate into ratifying the\u000a      International Labour Organisation's convention regarding the treatment of\u000a      domestic workers. Allain's research, developed through the Bellagio-Harvard\u000a        Guidelines informs the decisions regarding the allocation of the\u000a      Global Fund for the Eradication of Slavery. The Global Fund is being used\u000a      to back anti-slavery groups and help give governments and activists the\u000a      resources need to tackle the problem of modern-day slavery.\u000a    As Bales has noted: \"Commitments to the fund already exceed $2 billion\u000a        and it is expected to lever further sums from participating governments.\u000a        It is another clear impact that the fund and its guiding research base\u000a        rest upon the foundation of Allain's work\" [vi].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Allain's research on the legal definition of slavery has transformed the\u000a      concept of slavery from being seen primarily as a historical phenomenon to\u000a      being a tool of relevance in dealing with contemporary exploitive\u000a      practices. As a result, courts, particularly the Australian Supreme Court\u000a      (known as the High Court of Australia), have applied the law of slavery\u000a      where previously they did not; and leading NGOs now use Allain's work as\u000a      the basis of their understanding of slavery in their lobbying efforts, in\u000a      mobilizing public opinion, and in providing direct services to affected\u000a      people. Furthermore, Allain's research is the foundation upon which an\u000a      initiative, which has raised in excess of $2 billion to address\u000a      contemporary slavery, is based. This private\/public funding initiative\u000a      which is designed to `eradicate slavery in one generation' is utilising\u000a      Allain's research as the baseline as to what constitutes contemporary\u000a      slavery for its funding allocation for governments and NGOs in their\u000a      anti-slavery work.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Queen's University, Belfast\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen's University Belfast","InstitutionName":"Queen's University Belfast","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Northern Ireland","UKPRN":10005343}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    (a) Key Publications\u000a    [REF 2 output] Allain Slavery in International Law: Of Human\u000a        Exploitation and Trafficking, (The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 2013),\u000a      428pp.\u000a    \u000a[1] Allain, The Slavery Conventions: The Travaux Pr&#233;paratoires of the\u000a        1926 League of Nations Convention and the 1956 United Nations Convention,\u000a      (Martinus Nijhoff, 2008) 821pp.\u000a    \u000a\u000a[2] Allain (ed.)

The subsequent\u000d\u000a      adoption of the concept of \"justiciable problem\" and replication of the\u000d\u000a      PTJ survey by governments around the world has extended the reach of its\u000d\u000a      influence to the design of international legal aid policy and provision.\u000d\u000a      Since the publication of Paths to Justice in 1999, 14 different\u000d\u000a      jurisdictions have invested in and carried out 22 replications of Genn's\u000d\u000a      original study.\u000d\u000a    Civil and Social Justice Survey (England and Wales): The original\u000d\u000a      PTJ survey is now funded by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and\u000d\u000a      institutionalised as a continuous panel study, the Civil and Social\u000d\u000a        Justice Survey (CSJS), which replicates the original PTJ methodology\u000d\u000a      [a]. In the reporting period, the CSJS was run in 2010 and 2012, with the\u000d\u000a      most recent survey results published in 2013 [2]. Continued government\u000d\u000a      investment demonstrates the value of the findings for policy development,\u000d\u000a      even &#8212; or perhaps especially &#8212; in times of constrained public spending.\u000d\u000a    International adoption: The longevity and reach of Genn's\u000d\u000a      pioneering research is demonstrated by the worldwide adoption of the PTJ\u000d\u000a      survey approach and use of resulting data to inform legal aid policy and\u000d\u000a      services. Between 2008 and 2013, PTJ style surveys have been commissioned\u000d\u000a      by Governments in Australia (2008 and 2012) [3], Canada (2008) [4], Hong\u000d\u000a      Kong (2008) [5], Scotland (2009), Moldova (2011), Netherlands (2009),\u000d\u000a      Taiwan (2011) [6], and Ukraine (2010).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The report of the most recent Australian survey in 2012 [3] explains\u000d\u000a        that the PTJ method was adopted because \"Genn's [justiciable\u000d\u000a          problems] approach has a number of advantages over the more\u000d\u000a          traditional narrow approach...it allows more accurate estimates of the\u000d\u000a          incidence of legal problems...provides a more comprehensive assessment\u000d\u000a          of all the different pathways used for the resolution of legal\u000d\u000a          problems, and... provides a firmer basis for understanding both\u000d\u000a          `expressed' and `unmet' legal need\" [3, p. 5].\u000d\u000a      The Scottish Government, explaining its intention in 2009 to undertake\u000d\u000a        regular PTJ style surveys (now part of the annual justice survey) said\u000d\u000a        of Paths to Justice Scotland [b], \"This seminal piece of work\u000d\u000a          laid the foundations of how we view the prevalence of civil law\u000d\u000a          problems in Scotland and how people behave when faced with these\u000d\u000a          problems\" [11, para. 1.15].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Influence on policy and practice in the UK and abroad\u000d\u000a      Fourteen years on from publication, PTJ [a] and Genn's subsequent survey\u000d\u000a      and research [b, c] have led to identifiable changes during the REF impact\u000d\u000a      period in access to justice policies and practices. The far-reaching\u000d\u000a      national and international impact of PTJ was, in 2013, tracked and\u000d\u000a      documented in a Paths to Justice Review commissioned by the\u000d\u000a      Nuffield Foundation [1]. This Review provides evidence from policy\u000d\u000a      makers, legal aid and justice ministry officials in England and Wales,\u000d\u000a      Scotland, Northern Ireland, New Zealand, Canada and Australia. It confirms\u000d\u000a      that PTJ style survey results have been \"persuasive and influential\"\u000d\u000a      and have \"transformed understanding of public justice needs, of\u000d\u000a        not-for-profit service provision, and of market service provision\"\u000d\u000a      in the UK and around the world [1, p. vi]. PTJ research has influenced at\u000d\u000a      least three specific policy areas:\u000d\u000a    Spending prioritisation: The identification of problem clustering\u000d\u000a      and `trigger' problems in PTJ and CSJS has directly influenced legal aid\u000d\u000a      policy in the UK and internationally [1, p. 43]. From 2008-11 the Legal\u000d\u000a      Services Commission's (LSC) strategic prioritisation policy was directly\u000d\u000a      informed by CSJS data. \"We are aware that good, early advice prevents\u000d\u000a        relatively simple civil issues from becoming more serious and we are\u000d\u000a        working towards developing a framework of joined-up services with legal\u000d\u000a        aid providers being free to shape delivery around the needs of\u000d\u000a        particular areas\" [7, p. 9]. In Australia, PTJ surveys have\u000d\u000a      influenced the development of the Attorney-General's 2009 Strategic\u000d\u000a        Framework for Access to Justice [8] and the on-going development of\u000d\u000a      client centred services. Findings have shaped the direction of reform of\u000d\u000a      publicly-funded legal services, specifically: greater targeting of those\u000d\u000a      most in need, outreach to hard-to-help groups, joining-up of legal and\u000d\u000a      non-legal services, and early intervention to prevent problem escalation\u000d\u000a      [8, containing 53 references to PTJ-style surveys].\u000d\u000a    Redesigning existing legal aid services: Responding to PTJ and\u000d\u000a      CSJS identification of problem clustering, a strategic priority of the\u000d\u000a      English Legal Services Commission (LSC) from 2006 to 2010 was establishing\u000d\u000a      Community Legal Advice Centres and Networks (CLACs and CLANs) providing an\u000d\u000a      `integrated and seamless' service that would be a model for\u000d\u000a      delivery of `combined social welfare services' (including debt,\u000d\u000a      housing, welfare benefits, employment)' [9, p. 16-18]. By 2010 five had\u000d\u000a      been established (four during 2008-9 in Hull, Leicester, Derby, and\u000d\u000a      Portsmouth) and evaluated as offering significant benefits to the\u000d\u000a      community, `specifically the benefits conferred from having a range of\u000d\u000a        advice expertise, under one roof\" [10, p. 182]. In Australia, survey\u000d\u000a      findings have influenced the development of medical-legal partnership\u000d\u000a      pilots and legal aid programmes that link with health and social service\u000d\u000a      providers to provide `wrap around services' [1, p. 55].\u000d\u000a    Public legal education (PLE) initiatives: PTJ results underpinned\u000d\u000a      the development of PLE in the UK and abroad. From 2004-7 Genn headed an\u000d\u000a      MoJ funded PLE Taskforce which led directly to the establishment in 2008\u000d\u000a      of a Ministerial PLE Strategy Group, Chaired by the Minister (then Lord\u000d\u000a      Hunt) and with Genn as a member. This in turn led in 2010 to the creation\u000d\u000a      of Law For Life, a charity that \"equips ordinary people with the\u000d\u000a      knowledge, confidence and skills that they need to deal effectively with\u000d\u000a      everyday law-related issues\" [13]. Launching the charity in 2010 the\u000d\u000a      Justice Minister at the time, Lord Bach, made clear that the findings of\u000d\u000a      PTJ had influenced his decision to support PLE initiatives, saying that\u000d\u000a      the PTJ arguments were \"powerful... when [Genn] wrote them back in\u000d\u000a        1999 and even more so today...\" [13]. PTJ style survey results have\u000d\u000a      also inspired similar PLE projects in Canada [1, p. 56].\u000d\u000a    Impact on access to justice discourse in UK and abroad: Paths\u000d\u000a        to Justice and its tradition of surveys produced a fundamental shift\u000d\u000a      in justice policy thinking from a focus on lawyers and courts to a \"client\u000d\u000a      focus\" where policy is designed to meet the needs of the public. The Chief\u000d\u000a      Research Adviser to the Canadian Federal Justice Department, responsible\u000d\u000a      for conducting the 2008 PTJ style survey in Canada, stated that \"the\u000d\u000a        paradigm shift from a focus on lawyers and courts as the path to justice\u000d\u000a        to the broader range of legal problems and pathways to deal with them is\u000d\u000a        clearly influencing policy thinking\" [14]. In England and Wales, the\u000d\u000a      findings were used for a decade in the 2000s to better target legal aid\u000d\u000a      expenditure and deliver effective services [7]. From 2010-13, when the\u000d\u000a      Coalition government sought to cut legal aid, PTJ research findings were\u000d\u000a      frequently used by opposition politicians and the advice sector as\u000d\u000a      important evidence for preserving legal aid funding. For example, during\u000d\u000a      the House of Lords debate on the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of\u000d\u000a      Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO), Lord Hart (special adviser to the Lord\u000d\u000a      Chancellor in 1999) used PTJ to predict the impact of proposed legal aid\u000d\u000a      changes on citizens. He referred specifically to problem-clustering\u000d\u000a      saying: \"The spiral of decline triggered by one event leading to\u000d\u000a        another was all too obvious from the case studies I saw. ... the spiral\u000d\u000a        is well documented. I was particularly impressed by the work of\u000d\u000a        Professor Dame Hazel Genn at UCL in her book, Paths to Justice, and she\u000d\u000a        was a great help to the Department in my day\" [12].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Paths to Justice is a landmark body of survey research that has\u000d\u000a      provided critical data on the public experience of the justice system and\u000d\u000a      transformed understanding of and government policy on the legal needs of\u000d\u000a      citizens.

Adopting a pioneering approach to legal needs\u000d\u000a      research, Genn created the concept of the \"justiciable problem\" (disputes\u000d\u000a      that might have a legal solution) and asked:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      What are the justiciable problems the public face?\u000d\u000a      What do they do about them?\u000d\u000a      What happens when they cannot access good advice?\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Specific issues examined included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      incidence and nature of justiciable problems;\u000d\u000a      problem resolution strategies;\u000d\u000a      advice-seeking behaviour;\u000d\u000a      use of lawyers;\u000d\u000a      experience of legal procedures;\u000d\u000a      objectives in seeking redress;\u000d\u000a      outcomes and impact on health and well-being;\u000d\u000a      attitudes to the legal system.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The survey involved multiple stages and methods, including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Screening survey of face-to-face interviews with a national sample of\u000d\u000a        4,125 adults;\u000d\u000a      Main survey of face-to-face interviews with 1,134 adults;\u000d\u000a      Follow-up in depth interviews with 40 respondents experiencing\u000d\u000a        justiciable problems.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Key findings include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The experience of justiciable problems is widespread, but the most\u000d\u000a        common problems involve debt, consumer matters, disputes with landlords\u000d\u000a        or neighbours, and employment problems.\u000d\u000a      Problems often \"cluster\" together with identifiable `trigger' events\u000d\u000a        producing a cascade of further problems. This phenomenon points to a\u000d\u000a        critical need for targeted early advice and intervention.\u000d\u000a      Socially-excluded groups are disproportionately likely to do nothing\u000d\u000a        to resolve their problems, often feeling powerless and unsure about\u000d\u000a        rights and the availability of help. This indicates a need for targeting\u000d\u000a        this group and increasing their legal awareness.\u000d\u000a      There is a widespread lack of knowledge about where to get advice\u000d\u000a        about law-related civil problems. Citizens often seek help from\u000d\u000a        inappropriate sources. Free services need to be well `signposted' and\u000d\u000a        conveniently located.\u000d\u000a      Unresolved justiciable problems can significantly impact health,\u000d\u000a        family and work. There is value in investing in joined up services to\u000d\u000a        avoid the social cost of lack of access to justice.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Since the publication of Paths to Justice in 1999, Genn has\u000d\u000a      presented the research methods and findings to justice policy advisers,\u000d\u000a      judges and third sector advisers in the UK and around the world. She\u000d\u000a      repeated the survey in Scotland between 1997 and 1999, funded by the\u000d\u000a      Nuffield Foundation and run in collaboration with Professor Alan Paterson\u000d\u000a      (Strathclyde University) [b]. In 2001 the Legal Services Commission\u000d\u000a      repeated the Paths to Justice survey in England and Wales in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Genn, with further findings reported by Genn in 2004\u000d\u000a      [c]. This was followed by four further iterations of the survey, renamed\u000d\u000a      the Civil and Social Justice Survey (CSJS), in 2004, 2006, 2010,\u000d\u000a      and 2012.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38860","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Enonchong's research had a direct effect on the decision of the High\u000a      Court of Singapore in the\u000a      case of Tam Tak Chuen v Khairul bin Abdul Rahman and Others [2009]\u000a      Singapore Law Reports\u000a      240 (source 1 below). The court fully adopted all three main insights of\u000a      his research.\u000a    In Tam Tak Chuen, the court was faced with the question whether a\u000a      threat to do something that the\u000a      defendant had the right to do (i.e. to institute proceedings for the\u000a      winding up of a company) could\u000a      be regarded as illegitimate so that it could constitute duress. In\u000a      answering that question in the\u000a      affirmative, thereby developing the law of Singapore, the court was guided\u000a      by the relevant section\u000a      of the monograph.\u000a    In paragraph 21 of the judgment, Prakash J stated that there are two\u000a      elements to the wrong of\u000a      duress. Then, relying on Enonchong's argument, she continued:\u000a    \"In regard to the second element, that of illegitimate pressure, a threat\u000a      has been described\u000a      as illegitimate where the:\u000a    `terms secured as a result of the threat of lawful action are so\u000a      \"manifestly\u000a      disadvantageous\" to the complainant as to make it unconscionable for the\u000a      defendant to\u000a      retain the benefit of them.\" (See p. 34 of Duress, Undue Influence and\u000a        Unconscionable\u000a        Dealing by Nelson Enonchong (London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2006) (\"Enonchong\"))'.\u000a    After recounting the facts of the case, the judge turned to the question\u000a      whether illegitimate\u000a      pressure was exercised by the defendant. Again she turned to the book for\u000a      guidance, and stated at\u000a      paragraph 50:\u000a    \"Enonchong classifies the circumstances which, according to the\u000a      authorities, indicate when\u000a      a threat of lawful action that is not unlawful is illegitimate. These\u000a      categories are:\u000a    (a) where the threat is an abuse of legal process;\u000a    (b) where the demand is not made bona fide;\u000a    (c) where the demand is unreasonable; and\u000a    (d) where the threat is considered unconscionable in the light of all the\u000a      circumstances.\u000a    Then, adopting the four factors stated in the book, she applied them to\u000a      the facts of the case.\u000a    The first factor, whether the threat was an abuse of the legal process,\u000a      was applied in paragraphs\u000a      52 to 53. The second factor, whether the demand was made bona fide, was\u000a      applied in paragraphs\u000a      54 to 57. The third factor, whether the demand was unreasonable, was\u000a      applied in paragraph 58.\u000a      And the fourth factor, whether the demand was unconscionable, was applied\u000a      in paragraph 59. As\u000a      the court concluded that all the factors were satisfied, it held that the\u000a      defendant's threat of lawful\u000a      action was illegitimate and therefore constituted duress, since the other\u000a      element of duress was\u000a      also present. This was the first reported case in the Commonwealth to\u000a      decide that a threat of lawful\u000a      action, which was not unlawful, was illegitimate and constituted duress.\u000a    Thus, Enonchong's research had a direct impact on the court's decision.\u000a      The judge fully accepted\u000a      and adopted all three main insights of the research: (i) the distinction\u000a      between a threat of lawful\u000a      action that is unlawful and a threat of lawful action that is not\u000a      unlawful; (ii) that a threat of lawful\u000a      action that is not unlawful can constitute duress and (iii) that the four\u000a      factors proposed in the\u000a      research are the relevant ones to consider when deciding whether or not a\u000a      threat of lawful action\u000a      that is not unlawful is illegitimate and so can constitute duress.\u000a    This ruling was approved by different judges in two subsequent cases in\u000a      the same court. First, in E\u000a        C Investment Holding Pte Ltd v Ridout Residence Pte Ltd [2011] 2 SLR\u000a      232, Loh J approved the\u000a      passage in Enonchong's book relied on in the Tam Tak case,\u000a      although he advocated caution when\u000a      approaching the fourth of the four circumstances identified by Enonchong\u000a      and adopted in the Tam\u000a        Tak case (source 2). Secondly, in Tjong Very Sumito v Chan Sin\u000a        En [2012] 3 SLR 953 Chong J\u000a      cited Enonchong's book and the two previous decisions (Tam Tak and\u000a      EC Investment), in support\u000a      of the proposition that four factors are relevant to the question whether\u000a      a threat of lawful action is\u000a      illegitimate and adopted the four factors identified in Enonchong's book\u000a      (source 3). This means that\u000a      in Singapore the law on lawful act duress is now largely settled.\u000a    Thus Enonchong's research has had a direct and significant effect on the\u000a      development of the law\u000a      of economic duress in the Commonwealth. This area of the law is vitally\u000a      significant in both\u000a      domestic and international business transactions where parties seek to\u000a      exert pressure on each\u000a      other by threatening to do a variety of lawful acts. Prior to these court\u000a      decisions there was much\u000a      uncertainty in the Commonwealth about the extent to which lawful act\u000a      duress was actionable.\u000a      Following these rulings, based exclusively on Enonchong's arguments, the\u000a      law on lawful act\u000a      duress in Singapore is now largely settled.\u000a    The beneficiaries of the impact are all those (including judges,\u000a      arbitrators, lawyers and their clients)\u000a      who rely on the law of Singapore, both in Singapore and jurisdictions\u000a      where the law of Singapore is\u000a      applicable (including international commercial arbitrations). This area of\u000a      the law has particular\u000a      relevance to threats made in the course of commercial transactions,\u000a      whether domestic or\u000a      international. While it is impossible to quantify the number of cases on\u000a      this issue, allegations of\u000a      economic duress are common in everyday commercial life and practising\u000a      lawyers advise on it\u000a      frequently.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Enonchong's research has had a direct and significant effect on\u000a      the development of the\u000a      law relating to economic duress in Singapore and the Commonwealth.

The underpinning research is a\u000a      monograph entitled\u000a      Duress, Undue Influence and Unconscionable Dealing, published by a\u000a      leading\u000a      academic\/professional publisher (output R1 below). The research was\u000a      carried out in 2001-2005\u000a      and Enonchong was the sole researcher.\u000a    Enonchong's research emanated from the fact that the law was in a state\u000a      of flux, in England and\u000a      throughout the Commonwealth. First, it was unclear whether a threat of\u000a      lawful action could ever\u000a      constitute duress. Secondly, even if it could, there was no clear guidance\u000a      as to the circumstances\u000a      when such a threat could be regarded as illegitimate so as to constitute\u000a      duress.\u000a    The book examined the law relating to the circumstances when courts will\u000a      give a remedy to a\u000a      person who has made a payment or entered into a contract because of\u000a      pressure which the law\u000a      considers unacceptable, or where one party took unfair advantage of\u000a      another party's\u000a      circumstances of serious disadvantage to impose unfair contract terms on\u000a      the weaker party. Under\u000a      English law, and the law of many Commonwealth jurisdictions, there are\u000a      three main grounds on\u000a      which the courts can intervene in these circumstances: duress (or overt\u000a      pressure), undue influence\u000a      and unconscionable conduct.\u000a    The arguments underpinning the impact relate to the law of duress. Prior\u000a      to the impact (i.e. the\u000a      decision of the court) it was unclear in what circumstances a threat by\u000a      one person to do something\u000a      that he had a right to do (i.e. a threat of lawful action) could amount to\u000a      duress (that is to say,\u000a      unacceptable pressure) that can give rise to a judicial remedy.\u000a    In Chapter 3 Enonchong made three key points. First, he argued that a\u000a      distinction should be drawn\u000a      between a threat of lawful action which can become unlawful if made to\u000a      back a particular demand\u000a      (e.g., an unwarranted demand to pay money) and a threat of lawful action\u000a      which is not unlawful\u000a      even if made to support a demand (paragraphs 3-016 to 3-021). In the\u000a      latter case, where the threat\u000a      of lawful action is not unlawful, prior to publication of the research\u000a      there was no reported case\u000a      where it had been decided that such a threat constituted duress. Secondly,\u000a      Enonchong argued that\u000a      a threat of lawful action that was not unlawful could be illegitimate and\u000a      therefore constitute duress\u000a      in certain circumstances (paragraph 3-021). Thirdly, Enonchong identified\u000a      four circumstances\u000a      where he argued such a threat of lawful action could constitute duress\u000a      (paragraphs 3-022 to 3-031).\u000a\u0009  These are:\u000a    (a) where the threat is an abuse of legal process;\u000a    (b) where the demand is not made bona fide;\u000a    (c) where the demand is unreasonable; and\u000a    (d) where the threat is considered unconscionable in the light of all the\u000a      circumstances.\u000a    In England, and many other Commonwealth countries, this area of research\u000a      is not covered by\u000a      legislation and the development of the law is left to judges.\u000a    The insights advanced by Enonchong introduced innovative ideas on how\u000a      courts should deal with\u000a      the issue of lawful act duress. No commentator (or court) had ever\u000a      proposed the distinction\u000a      between a threat of lawful action that becomes unlawful because of the\u000a      demand, on the one hand,\u000a      and a threat of lawful action that is not unlawful even if made to support\u000a      a demand, on the other\u000a      hand. Moreover, although some commentators had expressed conflicting views\u000a      as to whether or\u000a      not a threat of lawful action could constitute duress, no one had\u000a      identified and explained the four\u000a      circumstances when such a threat could constitute duress. Enonchong's\u000a      approach in proposing the\u000a      four circumstances outlined above is completely new.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38861","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Arnull's work has had impact on EU primary and secondary law and the\u000d\u000a      evolution of case law. It has been of benefit to businesses and\u000d\u000a      individuals affected by EU measures through helping to secure access to\u000d\u000a      justice and effective dispute resolution. Because this reinforces the rule\u000d\u000a      of law, it has also been of benefit to the EU itself since this is one of\u000d\u000a      the values on which it is founded.\u000d\u000a    The ECJ's case law on standing came under renewed attack in the 1990s by\u000d\u000a      Arnull and other scholars, some of whom were cited alongside Arnull by AG\u000d\u000a      Stix-Hackl in Case C-312\/00 P Commission v Camar [2002] ECR\u000d\u000a      I-11355, 11371 (n.15). Arnull's 1995 and 2001 articles (R1 and R3), as\u000d\u000a      well as the book chapter published in 2000 (R2), were cited in UPA\u000d\u000a      by AG Jacobs, one of the ECJ's longest-serving and most influential\u000d\u000a      Advocates General. He described Arnull's 2001 article as `one of the\u000d\u000a      fullest and most authoritative recent studies' on the subject (para 100 of\u000d\u000a      the Opinion). The ECJ's decision in that case led to discussion in the\u000d\u000a      Convention on the Future of Europe on whether (and if so how) the standing\u000d\u000a      rules should be changed. A provision having that effect was included in\u000d\u000a      the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe. Following the failure\u000d\u000a      of that Treaty, the provision concerned was incorporated in the Treaty on\u000d\u000a      the Functioning of the EU, which took effect on 1 December 2009. The\u000d\u000a      relevant paragraph had never previously been amended. The General Court\u000d\u000a      acknowledged that the new provision `pursues an objective of opening up\u000d\u000a      the conditions for bringing direct actions...' (Case T-262\/10 Microban\u000d\u000a        v Commission, judgment of 25 October 2011, para 32). However, in\u000d\u000a      Case C-583\/11 P Inuit and Others v European Parliament and Council,\u000d\u000a      judgment of 3 October 2013, the Court of Justice construed the new\u000d\u000a      provision narrowly. Its judgment is likely to attract criticism from\u000d\u000a      academics and legal practitioners and lead to pressure for further reform.\u000d\u000a    Arnull's work on the EU's court structure prompted an invitation in 2010\u000d\u000a      to submit evidence (both written and oral) on the workload of the ECJ to\u000d\u000a      the House of Lords EU Committee. His evidence was cited extensively in\u000d\u000a        the Committee's report, The Workload of the Court of Justice of\u000d\u000a        the European Union, published on 6 April 2011 (see source 1 below).\u000d\u000a      The Committee endorsed Arnull's view that the relationship between the ECJ\u000d\u000a      and the national courts should be safeguarded (written evidence, para 21;\u000d\u000a      report, para 108) and that access to the case law in a language that all\u000d\u000a      EU citizens could understand reinforced the legitimacy of both the ECJ and\u000d\u000a      the General Court (oral evidence, QQ 15-19; report, para 68). The\u000d\u000a      Committee agreed with Arnull that the Member States and the other\u000d\u000a      institutions should be receptive when the ECJ suggested changes to its\u000d\u000a      procedural rules (oral evidence, Q 35; report, para 91). Following a\u000d\u000a      suggestion by Arnull (written evidence, para 14) and other witnesses, the\u000d\u000a      Committee recommended an increase in the number of Judges of the General\u000d\u000a      Court (report, para 136).\u000d\u000a    The Committee's report was welcomed by the British Government (source 2)\u000d\u000a      and the European Commission (source 3). The report was debated in the\u000d\u000a      House of Lords on 17 October 2011 (source 4).\u000d\u000a    The Committee visited the Union Courts in November 2010 and received\u000d\u000a      evidence from a number of members. On 28 March 2011, the ECJ submitted to\u000d\u000a      the European Parliament and the Council under Article 281 TFEU a package\u000d\u000a      of requests, including one for an increase in the number of Judges of the\u000d\u000a      General Court. The European Parliament and the Council gave partial effect\u000d\u000a      to those proposals in August 2012 with the adoption of Regulation 741\/2012\u000d\u000a      (source 5). They acknowledged the `continuing need to tackle delays\u000d\u000a      arising from the heavy workload of the General Court' (see preamble,\u000d\u000a      Regulation 741\/2012), but by the end of 2012 it was apparent that\u000d\u000a      agreement on increasing the number of Judges was some way off.\u000d\u000a    The Committee therefore decided to conduct a follow-up enquiry and sought\u000d\u000a      the views of the witnesses to the original enquiry on intervening\u000d\u000a      developments. In February 2013, Arnull submitted a response suggesting a\u000d\u000a      more economical way in which the problem might be resolved, and arguing\u000d\u000a      that there was a compelling case for increasing the number of Advocates\u000d\u000a      General in the ECJ. In its report published on 29 April 2013, the\u000d\u000a      Committee rejected the first suggestion (source 6, para 69) but\u000d\u000a      acknowledged that it had some support in the UK Government and other\u000d\u000a      Member States (paras 14 and 17). The Committee endorsed several other\u000d\u000a        points made by Arnull and quoted figures he had supplied on cases\u000d\u000a      concerning the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (paras 44 and 45). It\u000d\u000a      recommended that the Government should support an increase in the number\u000d\u000a      of Advocates General (paras 48-51). On 25 June 2013, the Council\u000d\u000a        adopted a decision increasing the number of Advocates General from\u000d\u000a      eight to nine in July 2013 and then to eleven in October 2015 (source 7).\u000d\u000a      Progress in other areas depends on the Member States.\u000d\u000a    The work described here is therefore shaping developments at case law,\u000d\u000a      legislative and Treaty level.

Facilitated by Birmingham's Institute of European\u000d\u000a      Law and staff seminar programme, the research comprises two monograph\u000d\u000a      chapters, three articles and two chapters in edited collections (outputs\u000d\u000a      R1 &#8212; R6 below). It examined:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the extent to which private applicants should be able to challenge EU\u000d\u000a        acts directly before the ECJ;\u000d\u000a      how to reconcile reform of the EU's court structure to accommodate the\u000d\u000a        growing case load with ensuring effective dispute resolution.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    These questions have important implications for the rights of individuals\u000d\u000a      and business entities and governance more generally.\u000d\u000a    The principal Treaty mechanism for challenging the validity of EU acts is\u000d\u000a      the action for annulment. The extent to which private applicants should\u000d\u000a      have standing to bring such actions has long been controversial, the ECJ\u000d\u000a      traditionally taking a strict view of the relevant Treaty provision.\u000d\u000a      Observing that in other respects the ECJ had construed that provision\u000d\u000a      liberally (R2), Arnull drew on developments in national legal systems,\u000d\u000a      human rights and the notion of citizenship to argue for a radically\u000d\u000a      relaxed standing test of `whether the applicant has been adversely\u000d\u000a      affected by the contested act' (R1). He pointed out that in certain\u000d\u000a      specific contexts, such as competition, State aid and dumping, the ECJ had\u000d\u000a      accepted that its general approach should be modified to counter obvious\u000d\u000a      injustice. Case C-309\/89 Codorniu v Council [1994] ECR I-1853\u000d\u000a      suggested that the ECJ might be willing to extend that modified approach.\u000d\u000a      However, old habits soon re-emerged, leading Arnull to call for a Treaty\u000d\u000a      change (R3). The debate came to a head in Case C-50\/00 P UPA v Council\u000d\u000a      [2002] ECR I-6677, where, after citing much of Arnull's work, AG Jacobs\u000d\u000a      proposed a new standing test of `substantial adverse effect' on the\u000d\u000a      interests of the applicant. However, the ECJ reaffirmed the traditional\u000d\u000a      test and asserted that any change to the position would indeed require a\u000d\u000a      Treaty change. It later overturned a controversial decision of the General\u000d\u000a      Court in which a more relaxed standing test had been applied. A provision\u000d\u000a      relaxing the standing rules was eventually included in the Treaty on the\u000d\u000a      Functioning of the EU adopted at Lisbon. Arnull's later work (R5 and R6)\u000d\u000a      examined the background to the new provision and considered its\u000d\u000a      implications.\u000d\u000a    Over roughly the same period, attempts were made to mitigate the effects\u000d\u000a      of the growth in the case load of the ECJ. Arnull's work in this area\u000d\u000a      explored the implications of the establishment of the General Court; the\u000d\u000a      limits initially imposed on its jurisdiction; and procedural reforms. As\u000d\u000a      the jurisdiction of the General Court grew and the most obvious case\u000d\u000a      management changes were introduced, Arnull argued that the reputation of\u000d\u000a      the General Court was now secure enough to enable more radical steps to be\u000d\u000a      contemplated, including more adventurous enlargement of its jurisdiction\u000d\u000a      (R4 and R5).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38862","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The law and practice of the Supreme Court of Canada and United\u000a        Nations High Commission\u000a        for Refugees has been significantly influenced by Cryer's research\u000a      on definitions of crimes,\u000a      principles of liability and defences in international criminal law,\u000a      specifically as they impact on\u000a      refugees.\u000a    Impact on Canadian Refugee Jurisprudence:\u000a    In July 2013, Cryer's book chapter (in R1 above) was cited by the\u000a        Supreme Court of Canada in\u000a      its landmark decision, Ezokola v Canada [2013] SCC 40 (see source\u000a      1 below). Cryer's argument\u000a      influenced the Court's new test to determine eligibility for refugee\u000a      status. In Ezokola, the Court had\u000a      to interpret Article 1F(a) of the 1951 Convention Relating to the\u000a        Status of Refugees, under which\u000a      claimants are denied refugee status if they are determined to have\u000a      committed a crime against\u000a      peace, a war crime or a crime against humanity. Prior to this case,\u000a      Canadian jurisprudence on\u000a      Article 1F(a) had been unclear and contradictory. Refugee applicants were\u000a      being excluded on the\u000a      basis of their membership of groups accused of such crimes, rather than\u000a      their individual\u000a      responsibility for the commission of crimes. The Federal Court of Appeal\u000a      in Canada had previously\u000a      held that those in authority could be considered complicit in an\u000a      international crime by remaining in\u000a      their position without protest and protecting their group\/government's\u000a      interests while being\u000a      conscious of the offences being committed in the name of their group. This\u000a      permitted guilt by\u000a      association and through passive acquiescence. The Supreme Court of Canada\u000a      was required to\u000a      bring consistency and coherence to this area of law. The Court recognised\u000a      that liability by virtue of\u000a      complicity plays a key role in the commission of international crimes,\u000a      owing to the large number of\u000a      people who tend to be involved in them. When deciding where the line\u000a      should be drawn between\u000a      association and complicity, the Court laid down a new `significant\u000a      contribution' test for determining\u000a      the criminal liability of refugees.\u000a    In creating this new test, the Supreme Court of Canada relied upon\u000a        Cryer's book chapter to rule\u000a      that there must be a voluntary, significant and knowing contribution on\u000a      behalf of the individual for\u000a      the criminal purposes of the group. Cryer's underpinning arguments,\u000a      utilised by the Supreme\u000a      Court, stress:\u000a    \u000a      The importance of the nature of joint criminal enterprise liability.\u000a    \u000a    The Supreme Court found that joint criminal enterprise requires that \"the\u000a      accused have made, at a\u000a      minimum, a significant contribution to the group's crime or criminal\u000a      purpose, made with some form\u000a      of subjective awareness of the crime or criminal purpose\" (para 67).\u000a    \u000a      The fact that to satisfy the actus reus requirement, membership in the\u000a        group per se is not\u000a        sufficient to ground liability. The defendant must perform an action\u000a        that contributes to the\u000a        implementation of the plan. There is no requirement that the\u000a        contribution made by the\u000a        defendant is a `necessary or substantial one', but...it needs to be\u000a        `significant' (pp.369-70).\u000a    \u000a    The Supreme Court held that \"guilt by association is not a means to\u000a      exclude\" and found that there\u000a      must be a link between the accused's conduct and the criminal conduct of\u000a      the group (para 67).\u000a      This helps to align Canadian jurisprudence with international law and\u000a      limits the overextended use\u000a      of Article 1F(a) of the 1951 Refugee Convention. The change\u000a        significantly impacts individuals\u000a        who would previously have been denied State protection, while\u000a      continuing to deny refugee\u000a      status to those individuals who were involved in serious international\u000a      crimes. The Senior Counsel,\u000a      Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes Section, Government of Canada,\u000a      confirmed that his\u000a      office \"uses [Cryer's] book regularly, most of the time when our office\u000a      provides legal advice to the\u000a      Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Border Service Agency...\u000a      the latter when\u000a      dealing with overseas visa applications or inland asylum or deportation\u000a      processes. Especially when\u000a      the question pertains to defences, either as a stand alone question or in\u000a      the context of child\u000a      soldiers, the book is one of the first sources we rely on, either directly\u000a      or as a guide for further\u000a      research ... The advice provided by our office... usually will find its\u000a      way into facta filed with either\u000a      the civil or criminal courts. Examples of the legal advice utilized in\u000a      this fashion in the civil context is\u000a      foremost the factum of the government as well as several facta of\u000a      intervenors in the recent case of\u000a      Ezokola before the Supreme Court of Canada, which itself referred to the\u000a      book in its decision\" (see\u000a      source 2 below).\u000a    Influencing UNHCR Guidelines:\u000a    In January 2013, Cryer participated as an invited expert to the UNHCR in\u000a      roundtable discussions\u000a      held in Colchester, UK, designed to revise and update the UNHCR's 2003\u000a      Guidelines on\u000a      International Protection: Application of the Exclusion Clauses issued\u000a      under Article 1F 1951\u000a        Refugee Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee\u000a        Convention). The aim of the\u000a      roundtable was to ensure that the guidance was aligned with advances in\u000a      International Criminal\u000a      Law, International Humanitarian Law, International Human Rights Law and\u000a      Refugee Law. Owing to\u000a      his expertise on International Criminal Law, and how crimes, principles of\u000a      liability and defences are\u000a      defined, Cryer was invited to provide expert advice on the expansion of\u000a      general principles of\u000a      liability in the determination of refugee status (the key issue to be\u000a      considered in the revision of\u000a      these Guidelines) (source 3). The discussion focused on the challenges\u000a      that modern developments\u000a      in the law on general principles of liability pose for refugee law, and\u000a      the fact that the guidelines\u000a      must reflect existing law rather than creating new law. A central concern\u000a      was whether a person\u000a      should be denied asylum on the basis of what s\/he has done. Cryer proposed\u000a      that the new\u000a      guidelines should reflect the controversy associated with the mental\u000a      element in group participation.\u000a      Drawing on the arguments in his book he advocated the need to balance the\u000a      dynamics of the\u000a      group nature of international crimes with individual responsibility, and\u000a      emphasised flaws in the\u000a      2003 guidance which contained little substance on the general principles\u000a      of the criminal law,\u000a      because it was not considered so important when this guidance was drawn up\u000a      (source 4).\u000a    Consequently the arguments in Chapter 15, where Cryer identified the\u000a      practical implications of\u000a      mens rea with regard to the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise\u000a      and criminal liability, underpin\u000a      proposals to reform the guidance on exclusion of refugees. Cryer's\u000a      contribution to the roundtable\u000a      has therefore influenced the UNHCR in applying the general\u000a      principles of liability and defining the\u000a      eligibility of refugee applicants, thus benefitting both the States which\u000a      implement the UNHCR\u000a      guidelines and those individuals seeking refuge within their borders. The\u000a      revised guidance\u000a      containing these changes, which will offer stronger legal protection to\u000a      refugees, will be published\u000a      by the UN in 2014. UNHCR guidelines are widely used by States in their\u000a      determination of refugee\u000a      status, and by lawyers acting for putative refugees. They are intended to\u000a      offer interpretative legal\u000a      guidance for governments, legal practitioners, decision-makers, the\u000a      judiciary, and UNHCR staff\u000a      carrying out refugee status determination in the field. In many cases, the\u000a      UNHCR actually\u000a      determines eligibility which States then follow. To give a sense of scale\u000a      of this problem, in 2010,\u000a      UNHCR conducted refugee status determinations in 67 countries, making\u000a      about 100,000\u000a      determinations. That amounts to 11% of global asylum applications (source\u000a      5, p.42.)\u000a    Summary\u000a    Cryer's research has thus shaped developments both in international\u000a        jurisprudence and at\u000a        the level of UN guidance, by facilitating access to justice for\u000a      refugee applicants in Canada and\u000a      contributing to improvements in the provision of guidelines for the\u000a      determination of refugees within\u000a      UN Member States. It thereby directly benefits governments, legal\u000a      practitioners, decision makers\u000a      and the judiciary implementing UNHCR guidelines, as well as the\u000a      individuals seeking refuge within\u000a      their borders.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Cryer's research on International Criminal Law has changed how\u000a      the human rights of\u000a      refugees are protected under International Law. First, it has\u000a      significantly influenced Canadian\u000a      jurisprudence in this field. Prior to the July 2013 decision of the\u000a      Supreme Court of Canada in\u000a      Ezkola v Canada, refugee claimants had been excluded from Canada on\u000a      the basis of their\u000a      association with others, rather than because they were individually\u000a      responsible for the commission\u000a      of international crimes.

It is a comprehensive\u000a      treatise on all aspects of\u000a      international criminal law. Cryer is the sole author of Chapter 15, the\u000a      chapter on general principles\u000a      of liability which examines:\u000a    \u000a      The nature of international criminal law and the definitions of\u000a        crimes, principles of liability\u000a        and defences.\u000a      The interpretation and application of international criminal law and\u000a        the law of armed conflict\u000a        in contemporary conflicts and circumstances.\u000a    \u000a    The arguments that underpin the chapter and the impact relate to the\u000a      general principles of liability\u000a      in international criminal law. In this regard Cryer argues for the\u000a      necessity to balance the dynamics\u000a      of the group nature of international crimes with individual\u000a      responsibility:\u000a    \"A person can be convicted of specific intent crimes such as genocide\u000a        even if that person did not\u000a        have the relevant mens rea for that offence, but the crimes were a\u000a        natural and foreseen incident of\u000a        the enterprise he or she was involved in on the basis of joint criminal\u000a        enterprise. This has led to\u000a        criticisms of joint criminal enterprise, as allowing the prosecution to\u000a        circumvent the proper mens\u000a        rea requirements for such serious crimes.\" (p. 373).\u000a    As Cryer notes, principles of liability play a more significant role in\u000a      international (as compared to\u000a      domestic) criminal law &#8212; reasoning which was to underpin the decision of\u000a      the Canadian Supreme\u000a      Court in Ezokola v Canada [2013] SCC 40. More specifically, he\u000a      stresses the importance of the\u000a      nature of joint criminal enterprise liability. He argues that joint\u000a      criminal enterprise requires that the\u000a      accused, at a minimum, made a significant contribution to the group's\u000a      crime or criminal purpose,\u000a      and did so with some form of subjective awareness of the crime or criminal\u000a      purpose:\u000a    \"membership in the group per se is not enough to ground liability on\u000a        this basis. There has to be\u000a        some form of action by the defendant to contribute to the implementation\u000a        of the plan...it needs to\u000a        be significant\" (pp.369-70).\u000a    As evidenced below, Cryer's research on the nature of international\u000a      criminal law and the definitions\u000a      of crimes, principles of liability and defences, and determination of\u000a      refugee status has played a\u000a      significant role in developments both in Canadian jurisprudence and more\u000a      broadly in the\u000a      formulation of UN policy in this field.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39044","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Macrory's research has led directly to new laws, regulations and a new\u000d\u000a      Environment Tribunal.\u000d\u000a    Legislative change: The Government accepted the core\u000d\u000a      recommendations in Macrory's 2006 Report [c], and legislated in the Regulatory\u000a        Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008 [1] for fixed monetary penalties\u000d\u000a      and discretionary requirements including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      variable monetary penalties;\u000d\u000a      compliance notices;\u000d\u000a      restoration notices;\u000d\u000a      variable monetary penalties with voluntary undertakings;\u000d\u000a      stop notices;\u000d\u000a      enforcement undertakings.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The published guidance to the Act explicitly refers to the Macrory Report\u000d\u000a      and the fact that the Act directly implements Macrory's recommendations\u000d\u000a      [2, pp.6, 17, 28, 43].\u000d\u000a    Creation of a new Environment Tribunal: Macrory's 2003 Report [a]\u000d\u000a      was the first to advocate a specific model for an environmental tribunal,\u000d\u000a      and it has been extensively referred to in discussions and literature\u000d\u000a      since then.

The work prompted us\u000d\u000a        to consider the issue in the round, and has influenced thinking in\u000d\u000a        government. As and when the opportunity arises, appeals are being\u000d\u000a        transferred if appropriate to the new tribunal in line with Macrory's\u000d\u000a        recommendation\" [15].\u000d\u000a    Creating a civil sanctions regime for environmental offences: For\u000d\u000a      a range of environmental offences committed after 2009, the UK\u000d\u000a      Environmental Agency has acquired civil sanction powers in Part III of the\u000d\u000a      Regulatory Enforcement &amp; Sanctions Act 2008 [2], the legislation\u000d\u000a      implementing Macrory's recommendations [b, c]. In its most recent\u000d\u000a      published Enforcement and Sanctions Policy (4\/1\/2011) the Agency states\u000d\u000a      that \"when considering the appropriate course of action to address\u000d\u000a        offending and to ensure compliance, we aim to follow the penalty\u000d\u000a        principles set out in the Macrory Review\" [3, p. 4]. In 2011, a\u000d\u000a      proposal by Oliver Letwin, Minister of State at the Cabinet Office, to\u000d\u000a      scrap the civil sanctions regime sparked debate amongst legal and\u000d\u000a      environmental professionals [17]. The Minister's main concern was the\u000d\u000a      possible impact on small businesses [11]. Opposition from Letwin and\u000d\u000a      others led to a cross-government review. This decided to keep the\u000d\u000a      sanctions regime recommended by Macrory in place: in future civil\u000d\u000a      sanctions would generally only be available in respect of companies with\u000d\u000a      250 plus employees, but offender Enforceable Undertakings (EUs) would be\u000d\u000a      available for everyone [18].\u000d\u000a    Impact on industry, NGOs and communities: The impact of civil\u000d\u000a      sanctions on industry, non- governmental organisations (NGOs) and\u000d\u000a      communities has been direct and far-reaching:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The Environment Agency reports that, in the period from January 2012 &#8212;\u000d\u000a        July 2013, 67 offender Enforcement Undertakings (EUs) were accepted by\u000d\u000a        the Agency [4].\u000d\u000a      Under previous regimes, these industries would have been prosecuted\u000d\u000a        even where no intention to breach regulations was involved. The\u000d\u000a        significance for industry now is that no formal admission of criminal\u000d\u000a        guilt is required (which can be a crucial factor for industry in terms\u000d\u000a        of reputation and insurability).\u000d\u000a      The Agency reports that approximately a third of breaches of\u000d\u000a        regulations are now self-reported by industry. Compliant industries\u000d\u000a        appreciate that no competitive gain is made since any economic gains\u000d\u000a        made by non-compliance, even inadvertently, are taken away in the form\u000d\u000a        of donations to third party charities.\u000d\u000a      The EUs also benefit charities and local communities. Over &#163;500,000\u000d\u000a        has been donated to charities under EUs since January 2012. This\u000d\u000a        includes large groups such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), but also\u000d\u000a        many local environmental groups such as Cheshire Wildlife Trust and\u000d\u000a        Young People's Trust for the Environment. Sums range from hundreds to\u000d\u000a        tens of thousands of pounds, and for some smaller charities these are\u000d\u000a        substantial and crucial to their survival [4,5].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Impact beyond the environment field: As an indication of the reach\u000d\u000a      of the impact of Macrory's work in this area, the terms Macrory\u000d\u000a          principles and Macrory characteristics have\u000d\u000a      become embedded in much of the contemporary institutional language of\u000d\u000a      regulatory sanctions, and are used by other regulatory institutions such\u000d\u000a      as the Food Standards Agency [6], Office of Fair Trading [7, 1.2, 2.8],\u000d\u000a      Office of Water Regulation [8 pp.1, 3, 4, 10] and Civil Aviation Authority\u000d\u000a      [9, Annex C, para. 3, 5, 11]. The National Audit Office, for instance,\u000d\u000a      states that \"The purpose of this programme of `Hampton Implementation\u000d\u000a        Reviews' is to provide regulators with a structured check on performance\u000d\u000a        against the Hampton principles and the Macrory characteristics.\"\u000d\u000a      [10, p.1]\u000d\u000a    Impact beyond England and Wales: While the 2006 Macrory Report\u000d\u000a      and proposals were focused on England and Wales, many of the underlying\u000d\u000a      principles and ideas have influenced policy development in other parts of\u000d\u000a      the UK where devolved governments have been considering the introduction\u000d\u000a      of civil sanctions. The Scottish Executive's 2012 Consultation\u000d\u000a        Document on Integrated Framework for Environmental Regulation relies\u000d\u000a      on the Macrory Report in its proposals for enforcement. It proposes to\u000d\u000a      create \"a range of flexible and proportionate enforcement options for\u000d\u000a        SEPA [Scottish Environmental Protection Agency]\" and supported this\u000d\u000a      recommendation by stating that Macrory's \"research suggests that a\u000d\u000a        flexible, proportionate, risk-based approach which utilises a range of\u000d\u000a        direct measures by SEPA is the most effective way of enforcing\u000d\u000a        legislation\" [12 at 3.5.3]. In August 2012 Professor Macrory led a\u000d\u000a      special seminar on policy development for SEPA and senior Scottish\u000d\u000a      government officials. The Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Bill, introduced to\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Parliament on 27 March 2013, proposes a new integrated\u000d\u000a      regulatory framework and a broader range of enforcement based on the\u000d\u000a      Macrory approach [19].\u000d\u000a    Similarly in Northern Ireland (NI), the Department of the Environment\u000d\u000a      published a White Paper in 2011, Environmental Better Regulation,\u000d\u000a      proposing new administrative penalties and a reform of criminal sanctions.\u000d\u000a      It concluded, \"The proposed changes are also in keeping with the\u000d\u000a        Hampton recommendations on risk-based inspection and the Macrory\u000d\u000a        review's recommendations on flexible penalties\" [13 p. 23]. In 2012\u000d\u000a      Professor Macrory was invited to discuss his proposals with the Minister\u000d\u000a      for the Environment and key legal officials in Northern Ireland.

In 2003, he was commissioned by the UK Department for\u000d\u000a      Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to investigate the possible\u000d\u000a      role of a new environmental tribunal. He:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      examined over 50 different appeal provisions in environmental\u000d\u000a        legislation, and found the system incoherent;\u000d\u000a      considered environmental judicial review proceedings and found that\u000d\u000a        judicial review applications concerning environmental decisions were\u000d\u000a        brought as much by industry as by members of the public or environmental\u000d\u000a        organisations.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    His 2003 report, Modernising Environmental Justice, Regulation and\u000d\u000a        the Role of an Environmental Tribunal [a], recommended an integrated\u000d\u000a      appeals system based on a specialised environmental tribunal. His study\u000d\u000a      argued this would bring heightened legal authority and coherence to\u000d\u000a      environmental regulation and significantly improve confidence in the\u000d\u000a      regulated industry, regulatory authorities and the general public.\u000d\u000a    Defra then commissioned Macrory to examine the issue of environmental\u000d\u000a      civil penalties. His 2003 Report [b] recommended that such penalties could\u000d\u000a      play a significant role in achieving more effective regulatory\u000d\u000a      enforcement. This report provided the intellectual foundations for his\u000d\u000a      subsequent work on civil penalties for the Cabinet Office. For both 2003\u000d\u000a      reports, Macrory was assisted by UCL Laws Research Assistant Michael\u000d\u000a      Woods.\u000d\u000a    Macrory was then invited to give evidence about his research on penalties\u000d\u000a      to the 2005 Hampton Review on Business and Regulation, and as a result he\u000d\u000a      was appointed by the Cabinet Office to lead a review on regulatory\u000d\u000a      sanctions more generally. The Macrory Review [c] looked at the\u000d\u000a      main reasons businesses failed to comply with regulations, and what could\u000d\u000a      be done to address the situation. The Macrory Review:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      considered the work of 56 national regulators and 468 local\u000d\u000a        authorities covering almost every area of business regulation;\u000d\u000a      included contributions from government departments, regulators,\u000d\u000a        judiciary, academics, victims and consumer groups, businesses and trade\u000d\u000a        associations.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    A report of the Review was published in 2006 by the Cabinet Office: Regulatory\u000a        Justice &#8212; Making Sanctions Effective (the Macrory Report)\u000d\u000a      [c]. The Macrory Report proposed six core principles that should\u000d\u000a      underlie the design of a modern sanctioning system, plus a number of characteristics\u000d\u000a      that all regulators should follow. Its core recommendations included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      designing sanctions in line with these core principles and\u000d\u000a        characteristics;\u000d\u000a      introducing new civil financial penalties as an alternative to\u000d\u000a        criminal sanctions;\u000d\u000a      introducing a new type of sanction, \"enforceable undertakings\",\u000d\u000a        negotiated between the regulator and the regulated body;\u000d\u000a      setting up pilot schemes to gain restorative justice for regulatory\u000d\u000a        non-compliance;\u000d\u000a      making available alternative sentencing options in criminal courts;\u000d\u000a      introducing new measures to improve transparency and accountability.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In 2010 after a new First Tier (Environment) Tribunal had been created in\u000d\u000a      line with Macrory's recommendations, the then Senior President of\u000d\u000a      Tribunals (Lord Justice Carnwath) requested that Macrory investigate\u000d\u000a      extending the jurisdiction of the new Environment Tribunal to other sorts\u000d\u000a      of environmental appeals. His study examined the provisions for\u000d\u000a      environmental appeals in over sixty pieces of legislation and conducted\u000d\u000a      research with the judiciary and practitioners. It found that the system\u000d\u000a      continued to be incoherent and confusing. The study was published in\u000d\u000a      Macrory's 2011 report, Consistency and Effectiveness &#8212; Strengthening\u000d\u000a        the New Environment Tribunal [d]. This proposed a more coherent\u000d\u000a      process with future appeals handled by the Environment Tribunal.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39230","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Following the presentations and contacts that Bano had made with users\u000a      such as the MoJ at the\u000a      outreach events outlined in section 2, above, the MoJ identified a policy\u000a      need relating to Shariah\u000a      Courts in the UK, and in 2009 commissioned Bano to conduct a specific\u000a      research project which\u000a      could be used to strengthen the evidence base on which future policy might\u000a      be made\u000a      (Corroborating Source 4). This commission was made on the basis of\u000a      Bano's expertise in this\u000a      area, with the intention of building upon her previous work (Output 4\u000a      in particular), notably in terms\u000a      of her findings around the construction of issues of identity, and the use\u000a      of participant interview\u000a      methodologies to explore Shariah practices (Corroborating Source 5).\u000a      The project was to involve\u000a      conducting empirical research into the nature and scope of Shariah\u000a      Councils in England, with a\u000a      particular focus on identifying as accurately as possible the number and\u000a      location of Shariah\u000a      Councils in England, their administrative structure, funding and\u000a      membership, and the range of\u000a      family-related work they carry out. There was such a paucity of research\u000a      in this hugely topical area\u000a      that Bano's work broke new ground. Even locating relevant Shariah Councils\u000a      was difficult, but,\u000a      through her efforts, 30 were identified, and surveyed via a\u000a      semi-structured questionnaire.\u000a    The results of this research were published by the Ministry of Justice in\u000a      report form\u000a      (Corroborating Source 6), with her findings that Shariah Courts did\u000a      not seek formal recognition as\u000a      alternative mechanisms of dispute resolution, and did not aim to replace\u000a      the established civil law in\u000a      matters of family law (most Shariah Courts are embedded within Muslim\u000a      communities, forming part\u000a      of mosques or community centres, and have evolved according to the needs\u000a      of those\u000a      communities), making a substantial contribution to the field. These\u000a      original and unique findings\u000a      were focused on the needs of the MoJ, and provided a means of\u000a      operationalizing Bano's wider\u000a      research themes into the policy language and agenda of government. As the\u000a      only research\u000a      commissioned by the MoJ on this topic, this report has been central in\u000a      informing governmental\u000a      discussions about the extension of dispute-resolution mechanisms like\u000a      Shariah Courts in a family\u000a      law context. The MoJ has, despite a change of Government during the\u000a      lifespan of the project that\u000a      meant a shifting of agendas and policy priorities, retained it as an\u000a      internal document for\u000a      subsequent policymaking practice, having consulted on its production and\u000a      used it to inform their\u000a      programme of engagement with Shariah councils (Corroborating Source 7).\u000a    As such, the research dissemination and outreach undertaken via this\u000a      project has contributed to\u000a      the internal workings and knowledge base of a Government Department in\u000a      relation to a complex\u000a      and often controversial issue. Indeed, subsequent to the completion of the\u000a      report, Bano was invited\u000a      by the MoJ to join a new initiative, the Family Justice Virtual Group &#8212; a\u000a      body which aims to provide\u000a      a forum for the development of research-led family justice policy (Corroborating\u000a        Source 8). Via\u000a      this mechanism, Bano's research findings, and the insights raised in the\u000a      MoJ report, have been\u000a      disseminated, and have contributed to ongoing debates in the field of\u000a      family justice and human\u000a      rights. For instance; in January 2012, Bano was invited by the Home Office\u000a      to attend and\u000a      participate in a roundtable discussion with the Home Secretary (the Rt Hon\u000a      Theresa May), the\u000a      Government Minister for Faith and Communities (the Rt Hon Baroness Warsi)\u000a      and a Ministry of\u000a      Justice Minister (Jonathan Djanogly MP), to discuss issues affecting the\u000a      Muslim community\u000a      (Corroborating Source 9). At the meeting, the findings of Bano's\u000a      ongoing research relating to\u000a      Shariah law, including religious marriage, were discussed, and the\u000a      MoJ-commissioned report\u000a      (Corroborating Source 6) was presented and considered. This\u000a      engagement demonstrates that\u000a      Bano's work has contributed to Government policymaking processes at the\u000a      highest level.\u000a    Additionally, her research has influenced wider social debates about the\u000a      accommodation of\u000a      Shariah law into English law. This is evidenced by the fact that in 2008\u000a      she was asked by the\u000a      editors of Ecclesiastical Law Journal to respond to a speech by\u000a      the Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr\u000a      Rowan Williams), in which he had claimed that there was a need to bridge a\u000a      distinct gap between\u000a      the practices of English law and religious (Muslim) minorities. Bano was\u000a      invited to deliver (and then\u000a      publish) a response piece in which she cautioned against the recognition\u000a      of religious norms and\u000a      principles into English law (Corroborating Source 10). This\u000a      engagement became a high-profile\u000a      dialogue and fed into the wider social understanding of these issues. When\u000a      the British Academy\u000a      sought to bring together a forum in 2011 on the issue of parallel legal\u000a      systems for the development\u000a      of ideas between researchers, policymakers, politicians and other\u000a      interested parties, Bano was\u000a      invited to disseminate her research with representatives of Government,\u000a      The Law Society, the\u000a      Equality and Human Rights Commission and other user groups (Corroborating\u000a        Source 1).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out by the University of Reading's Dr Samia Bano\u000a      (Lecturer 2005-2013) explored\u000a      the experiences of Muslim women who engage with the law, and particularly\u000a      their engagement with\u000a      Shariah law.

It looked at the\u000a      experiences of Muslim\u000a      women when using Shariah Councils, with a particular focus on debates\u000a      about multicultural rights\u000a      and the extent to which English law should accommodate the cultural and\u000a      religious demands of\u000a      minority religious communities (Outputs 1 and 2, Section 3).\u000a    Bano's work has demonstrated the complex realities of Muslim identity and\u000a      engagement with\u000a      Shariah law in the UK, and questioned assumptions about how far Muslim\u000a      women use religious\u000a      bodies to resolve family law disputes. Her research demonstrates a need to\u000a      ensure that formal\u000a      understandings of Shariah law reflect the lived realities of those who\u000a      participate in it (Outputs 3 and\u000a      4). A particular issue is that \"identities are fluid, multiple and\u000a      changing. The women in this study\u000a      identified themselves as Muslims, as British and as Pakistani in different\u000a      contexts. Cultural,\u000a      religious and legal diversity must therefore be understood to be in flux,\u000a      contested and open to\u000a      change\" (Output 4, p.63). Bano's research shows, via empirical\u000a      investigation of Muslim women's\u000a      own experiences, and theoretical interrogation of the ways that formal and\u000a      informal debates about\u000a      Shariah law construct issues of identity, that accepted notions of Shariah\u000a      as a parallel legal order\u000a      standing in opposition to `mainstream' English law are too simplistic. She\u000a      convincingly argues that\u000a      Shariah Courts form just one level in the construction of multi-layered\u000a      Muslim legal identities, and\u000a      do not lead inevitably to an exclusion of Muslim women from the mainstream\u000a      legal system. In\u000a      particular, Bano has argued through her research that Shariah Councils and\u000a      other mechanisms of\u000a      Shariah legal practice seek to remain part of Muslim communities,\u000a      providing practical and spiritual\u000a      guidance in matters of Muslim family law. They seek to complement the\u000a      existing legal system\u000a      rather than replace civil law in matters of marriage and divorce, a\u000a      critical finding in re-informing the\u000a      sometimes hostile and troubled public policy perceptions and debates\u000a      around this issue (Output 1).\u000a    These arguments have been developed in subsequent publications and\u000a      presented to a wide range\u000a      of academic and policy audiences (Corroborating Sources 1 and 2, Section\u000a      5). In 2008, Bano was\u000a      invited to join a roundtable of experts to discuss ways of developing the\u000a      knowledge base regarding\u000a      Shariah family law that is available to Government policymakers in the UK.\u000a      This meeting was\u000a      organised by Professor Mavis Maclean of the Oxford Centre for Family Law\u000a      and Policy (OXFLAP),\u000a      University of Oxford, and the MoJ, and Bano was one of the key\u000a      contributors. This allowed her to\u000a      present her research expertise in the context of a wider policy debate\u000a      around Shariah law, and to\u000a      outline how further research could be conducted in this area\u000a      (Corroborating Source 3). Finally, the\u000a      user engagement and impact-generating work that Bano has conducted with\u000a      the MoJ (outlined\u000a      below at section 4) has subsequently re-informed and stimulated her\u000a      ongoing research agenda:\u000a      most recently, her book (Output 1) includes detailed analysis of the\u000a      practical and conceptual limits\u000a      of religious arbitration in English law, based on data including that\u000a      obtained via the MoJ research\u000a      project.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39233","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Copies of the original research publication were disseminated directly to\u000a      a wide range of public, private and governmental organisations working\u000a      within the field of health and safety regulation. At the same time, a\u000a      series of presentations was given to industry audiences via organisations\u000a      such as the British Safety Council and the Institution of Occupational\u000a      Safety and Health (IOSH) between 2009 and 2012, thereby enabling the\u000a      research findings to percolate through a wider policy and user-group\u000a      audience (Corroborating Sources 3 and 4). This process of research\u000a      transfer was facilitated by a network of existing contacts that Almond had\u000a      cultivated with policy users and those in industry over a number of years.\u000a      These talks proved highly effective in getting the research across to a\u000a      large number of users who were then in a position to utilise the findings\u000a      as a means of underpinning attempts to redirect and inform public and\u000a      governmental policy-making discussions about health and safety regulation.\u000a      In addition, the research results were disseminated to a wider public\u000a      audience through coverage in a series of media articles (Corroborating\u000a        Sources 1 and 2). The core impact of the research derives from its\u000a      problematising and reframing of the issue of media stories about health\u000a      and safety as `regulatory myths', something which has\u000a      facilitated a better understanding among a wide range of public and\u000a      private bodies of the social impacts of such coverage. This understanding\u000a      has been utilised by IOSH in their submissions (Corroborating Sources 5\u000a        and 6) to the Young Review of Health and Safety (`Health and\u000a        Safety: Reducing the Burdens', 2010) as a basis for their criticisms\u000a      of the review process, and to strengthen their argument for a more\u000a      developed public engagement with health and safety regulation. Their\u000a      advocacy of \"better education, so that we have a `risk intelligent'\u000a        society in which people operate effectively and happily in a risk-based\u000a        system\", draws upon the research as evidence to support this\u000a      conclusion, employing the notion of regulatory myths as a way of\u000a      characterising the scale and the damaging implications of the problem of\u000a      public misperception. It was also utilised by the British Safety Council\u000a      in their submission to this process, again influencing their calls for an\u000a      evidence-led approach to regulation (Corroborating Source 4).\u000a      Additionally, Almond himself submitted the research to the Young Review\u000a      consultation process (Corroborating Source 7) in order to inform\u000a      the review. As such, the research findings played a role in holding to\u000a      account and public scrutiny the Young Review's public policy-making\u000a      process.\u000a    Subsequent to this, the Government-commissioned L&#246;fstedt Review made some\u000a      key recommendations about the future of health and safety regulation. This\u000a      report (Reclaiming health and safety for all, 2011) sought input\u000a      from various stakeholders on a range of issues concerning regulatory law\u000a      and practices, and regulation's public profile. The research output was\u000a      cited by IOSH in their submission (Corroborating Source 8),\u000a      responding critically to a request for information about \"examples\u000a        where health and safety regulations have led to unreasonable outcomes,\u000a        or to inappropriate litigation and compensation\" It was also\u000a      utilised by the British Safety Council in responding to this process (Corroborating\u000a        Source 4). Crucially, the research was cited by the L&#246;fstedt Review\u000a      itself in its discussion of the public perception of regulation, as \"a\u000a        helpful discussion of this issue,\" which established the troubling\u000a      political and legitimatory effects of these cases (Corroborating Source\u000a        9), as well as underpinning arguments in favour of a reframing of\u000a      the public standing of safety regulation. The importance of Almond's\u000a      research was cited by Professor L&#246;fstedt and others in public discussion\u000a      at the time of the review's publication (Corroborating Source 10).\u000a    The close and sustained nature of this engagement with a policy-making\u000a      process demonstrates the considerable significance of the impact\u000a      that the research has had via the conceptual reframing of the issue of\u000a      regulatory myths and the creation of an informed policy debate around\u000a      these issues. In the best traditions of socio-legal scholarship, the\u000a      evidence it provides has scrutinised the public process of law- and\u000a      policy-making (in the form of the L&#246;fstedt Review), and held it\u000a      accountable to an informed evidence base and a broader range of interests\u000a      and insights. The substantial scope of the impact produced can be\u000a      seen in its role in prompting a nascent reframing of wider debates about\u000a      health and safety regulation and the establishment of a more informed\u000a      understanding of risk issues. The research was cited in a number of\u000a      popular media sources (Corroborating Sources 1 and 2), and was also\u000a      influential in informing and shaping some core elements of the British\u000a      Safety Council's organisational manifesto, relating to the promotion and\u000a      creation of sensible regulation (Corroborating Source 4).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The findings of University of Reading research around the contemporary\u000a      proliferation of `regulatory myths' and media misrepresentation of health\u000a      and safety law have been used by a number of stakeholder organisations and\u000a      charitable bodies in evidence given to official Government reviews, and\u000a      drawn upon by those reviews as part of the development of policy\u000a      recommendations for Government.

Between 2007-2009, he undertook a research investigation into\u000a      `regulatory myths', an increasingly prominent feature of public debate\u000a      about health and safety regulation. This was published in 2009 in a\u000a      substantial peer-reviewed article in the Journal of Law and Society,\u000a      a leading socio-legal scholarly research publication with an international\u000a      reach and reputation (Output One).\u000a    A regulatory myth is a story about some act of regulatory\u000a      unreasonableness which is told as true and widely believed, but which\u000a      lacks factual verification. One example is the assertion that\u000a      schoolchildren must wear safety goggles when playing `conkers' in the\u000a      playground &#8212; something that has also been cited by politicians (David\u000a      Cameron, 01\/12\/2009) and Government bodies (the Young Review 2010),\u000a      despite the fact that it is untrue. These stories are important because\u000a      they affect public trust in the regulation of health and safety. Almond's\u000a      research identified the key features of these myths, such as a motif of\u000a      cultural conflict, a `post-trust' attitude towards regulation, a sense of\u000a      violated tradition and a factual fuzziness that makes them hard to\u000a      disprove. The research was primarily theoretical in nature, utilising\u000a      sociological analysis rather than empirical research. Almond demonstrated\u000a      that these stories express a form of politically motivated opposition to\u000a      interventionist, welfarist political undertakings, and are underpinned by\u000a      deregulatory agendas which are pro-tradition, critical of state\u000a      paternalism and which promote values of individual responsibility. He also\u000a      established that regulatory myths have had a detrimental influence over\u000a      policy-making, not least in validating political attacks on the regulatory\u000a      system and policies that fail to engage with the realities of occupational\u000a      health and safety. As such, these stories should be taken seriously as\u000a      challenges to the legitimacy of the law; they are expressions of a\u000a      political agenda and must be responded to as such, with an emphasis on\u000a      reasserting the values that regulation exists to protect, not simply on\u000a      rebutting stories that appear in the media.\u000a    Almond's findings fundamentally reconceptualised received understandings\u000a      of health and safety regulation as an object of media attention,\u000a      identifying the profound importance of this phenomenon at a time when\u000a      these wider perceptions were generally accepted as straightforwardly\u000a      reflective of a legal problem. The research has subsequently informed\u000a      public debates about regulation in this highly contested area (Corroborating\u000a        Sources 1 and 2), and provided insights that many organisations\u000a      working in the field have been able to rely on when seeking to establish\u000a      the need for more informed, and less distorted, debate. This was the first\u000a      scholarly research published anywhere to look at this issue, and has\u000a      subsequently been cited as a key contribution to regulatory studies\u000a      literature. It identified these stories as a coherent social phenomenon,\u000a      and coined the phrase `regulatory myth' to describe and reconceptualise\u000a      their appearance in contemporary media and public debates as meaningful\u000a      units of social analysis. It also provided policy-oriented insights to\u000a      assist in understanding how to counteract them.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39234","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Newdick's research was used in the development of an Ethical Framework\u000a      for use by NHS organisations and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) to assist\u000a      decision-making about the allocation of finite resources.

This document emphasises a\u000a      number of fundamental principles, and is written with a lay readership in\u000a      mind so as to guide NHS resource allocators (\"commissioners\") and patients\u000a      through the decision-making process. It reflected the approach developed\u000a      in Newdick's work in that it explicitly recognised the role of collective\u000a      considerations, like the cost of treatment and needs of the community, as\u000a      relevant elements in resource-allocation decisions. The Framework was\u000a      adopted for use in the Berkshire PCT, one of the first health authorities\u000a      to respond to the need for consistency in this area, in 2005, and was\u000a      subsequently adopted for use across the nine PCTs of the South Central NHS\u000a      Region (East Berkshire, West Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Isle\u000a      of Wight, Milton Keynes, Oxfordshire, Portsmouth and Southampton) in 2007\u000a      (Corroborating Source 1). This process was iterative and collaborative,\u000a      involving the sharing of expertise across an NHS region, and was\u000a      underpinned in part via Newdick's role as an Honorary Consultant and\u000a      Special Advisor on Law to the NHS South Central Priorities Committee.\u000a    The primary impact of Newdick's work (post-2007) took the form of a\u000a      change of policy and practice by a series of public bodies (the PCTs who\u000a      have implemented Ethical Frameworks as a result of his findings). The significance\u000a      of this impact derives from the research's widespread and pervasive use\u000a      within these organisations to guide all subsequent resource-allocation\u000a      decisions. Newdick's exemplar developed for Berkshire\/South Central Region\u000a      PCTs provides a pertinent demonstration of this, and there are many\u000a      examples from elsewhere in the country of PCTs - such as East Lancashire\u000a      in 2008 (Corroborating Source 2) and Wolverhampton City in 2009\u000a      (Corroborating Source 3) &#8212; which have explicitly based their practices and\u000a      policies on the initial model..\u000a    Newdick was also invited to contribute guidance materials based on his\u000a      research for the National Prescribing Centre (NPC), the central Government\u000a      body that informs resource decisions across the NHS (Corroborating Source\u000a      4), and the NHS Confederation published a report by Newdick recommending\u000a      this approach to other PCTs (Corroborating Source 5). These publications\u000a      disseminated a more robust and defensible way of balancing individual and\u000a      collective interests within NHS decision-making to a wider audience of\u000a      PCTs and NHS user bodies, illustrating the considerable reach of\u000a      this impact. As a result, decisions across the NHS are likely to be i)\u000a      different than they might otherwise be; ii) fairer in the way that they\u000a      account for collective and individual interests; and iii) less susceptible\u000a      to judicial challenge. Newdick's research (Output Two) was cited by the\u000a      Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice in a case concerning\u000a      inter-State resource allocation (Corroborating Source 6), and the South\u000a      Central Ethical Framework was endorsed in a 2011 UK Court of Appeal\u000a      decision involving the rights of transgender patients to cosmetic surgery.\u000a      A decision made under the auspices of the Ethical Framework was challenged\u000a      in judicial review, and was held to be lawful (Corroborating Source 7).\u000a    The impact of Newdick's work can also be understood in terms of a\u000a      redefinition of wider practice within the NHS and elsewhere. Newdick was\u000a      called to give evidence as an expert witness to the second inquiry into\u000a      the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust on the organisation and\u000a      structure of NHS decision-making processes (Corroborating Source 8), which\u000a      referenced his insights on institutional decision-making in its final\u000a      report (Corresponding Source 9, paragraph. 20.92), while in 2010 he was\u000a      invited to give expert evidence to NHS Scotland to assist in the\u000a      production of their report on priority-setting policy, Making\u000a        Difficult Decisions in NHS Boards in Scotland (Corroborating Source\u000a      10). This impact has even extended overseas: in December 2012, Newdick led\u000a      a two-day conference with Brazilian judges in the Federal University of\u000a      Fluminense, Rio de Janeiro, considering the extent to which his Ethical\u000a      Framework could resolve comparable judicial challenges in Brazil. In April\u000a      2013, legislative changes replaced PCTs with CCGs (clinical commissioning\u000a      groups); in May 2013, Newdick joined an NHS priorities committee to assist\u000a      local CCG commissioners to respond to the legal duties imposed upon them\u000a      and this role is likely to develop.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out by Professor Christopher Newdick in the School of\u000a      Law, University of Reading, explored the ways in which individualistic\u000a      `rights-based' models of healthcare cause problems within areas of finite\u000a      public resources, such as NHS treatment rationing and priority-setting.

The approach\u000a      he puts forward was developed in his book Who Should We Treat? &#8212;\u000a        Rights, Rationing and Resources in the NHS 2nd ed. (Oxford: Oxford\u000a      University Press. 2005), and journal article `Citizenship, Free Movement\u000a      and Health Care: Cementing Individual Rights by Corroding Social\u000a      Solidarity', Common Market Law Review (2006), among other\u000a      publications.\u000a    Newdick's work combined the legal principles developed by the courts\u000a      (which promote notions of `procedural justice') with the practical needs\u000a      of NHS priorities committees in order to produce a reasonable and ethical\u000a      process by which difficult decisions can be reached in ways that ought to\u000a      satisfy critical scrutiny. The demand for care is rising, resources are\u000a      being squeezed, medical developments offer more choice and hope for\u000a      treatment, and individuals are more litigious and possess increased rights\u000a      under domestic and EU law. Within this context, governments offer little\u000a      guidance on resource allocation, and so health commissioners are left to\u000a      develop their own processes for doing so. Newdick's research asked: if\u000a      hard choices have to be made, should we focus more on acute care to make\u000a      people better, chronic care to make them more comfortable, or preventative\u000a      care to stop people becoming sick in the first place? Do we need more\u000a      clinicians, more medicines or more hospitals? If hard choices are\u000a      unavoidable, who should make them: clinicians, local NHS managers, the\u000a      community or government?' As he stated in his 2005 book, there is `no\u000a      simple solution' (p1) and since 2011, within a climate of public-service\u000a      austerity, these decisions have become even more difficult.\u000a    Newdick's research into the procedural realities of NHS resource\u000a      allocation and the role of the actors involved in it identified that\u000a      decisions were often made on a case-by-case basis, as a matter of\u000a      `solving' discrete problems, and without a coherent frame of\u000a      understanding. By drawing on theoretical insights from communitarian\u000a      social and political theory, and the jurisprudence of UK and EU courts,\u000a      Newdick was able to devise a framework for decision-making that was both\u000a      procedurally fair and capable of taking into account collective interests\u000a      such as the cost of treatment, the needs of the community, and the need\u000a      for equity. His model applied communitarian theory so as to allow hard\u000a      choices to be made with finite NHS resources in ways which treat patients\u000a      transparently and consistently, even in the face of substantial pressures\u000a      on priority-setting mechanisms; as he notes: `as the pressures upon\u000a      resources become more intense, the pretence that rationing is someone\u000a      else's fault is no longer sustainable. If rationing is a fact of life, it\u000a      should take place within the framework of equality, fairness and\u000a      consistency between patients' 2005, p48). His model entails using\u000a      reflexive processes (rather than concrete principles) that recognise\u000a      individual rights as relative, not absolute, to guide decision-making.\u000a      This original research was thus of huge significance for the NHS in\u000a      underpinning the subsequent development of Ethical Frameworks to enable\u000a      resource allocation in a rational and transparent manner that should\u000a      reassure decision-makers, patients and the public. Priority-setting\u000a      exposes the NHS to the risk of judicial review; Ethical Frameworks nable\u000a      decision-makers to withstand this sort of legal challenge.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39236","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The original research (Output One) was published by the Nuffield\u000a      Foundation in November 2006 and was widely disseminated among\u000a      practitioners, policy-makers and interest groups. It was also made freely\u000a      available on the internet (Corroborating Source 3). The findings\u000a      were presented to user audiences via events including a one-day conference\u000a      held at the Nuffield Foundation at which key stakeholders, such as the Law\u000a      Commission and the Law Society, were in attendance.\u000a    The research has impacted upon public policy in two main ways. Firstly,\u000a      because the project fitted directly into an ongoing process of review of\u000a      the law relating to cohabitation breakdown, it proved immediately\u000a      influential, being repeatedly cited by the Law Commission in its 2007\u000a      Report on Cohabitation, and informing its decision to recommend reform of\u000a      the law (Corroborating Source 4: pp. 11, 70, 71, 193 and 198). The\u000a      endorsement of the researchers' work within those proposals meant that the\u000a      research evidence generated was able to stimulate and inform policy debate\u000a      around the issue of cohabitation and matrimonial property. Furthermore,\u000a      the need for reform, and the Law Commission's 2007 recommendations, were\u000a      also cited by the Supreme Court in the cases of Kernott v Jones\u000a      [2011] UKSC 53, and Gow v Grant [2012] UKSC 29. Despite this\u000a      judicial support, the Government announced in September 2011 that no\u000a      reform would be forthcoming in this Parliament.\u000a    In addition, the Court of Appeal in the 2009 decision of Radmacher v\u000a        Granatino utilised the research findings to evaluate arguments about\u000a      the basis on which decisions about the redistribution of property after\u000a      the breakdown of marriage should be made and the relevance of prenuptial\u000a      agreements (Corroborating Source 5, paragraph 8). Moreover, when\u000a      dealing with the existence of a European matrimonial regime in English\u000a      financial provision proceedings, Mr Justice Mostyn, the judge in B v S\u000a        (Financial Remedy: Marital Property Regime) [2012] EWHC 265 (Fam),\u000a      drew extensively upon the findings from the research concerning the\u000a      application of the regime in its home jurisdiction (Corroborating\u000a        Source 6, paragraphs 5-11). Together, this evidence demonstrates the\u000a      considerable scope of the impact of the research in informing judicial\u000a      decisions which not only rule upon the individual case being heard, but\u000a      also provide direction for subsequent exercise of judicial discretion in\u000a      deciding how financial provision orders should be made. The relevance of\u000a      the research is particularly acute where English judges are faced with\u000a      agreements drawn up in other jurisdictions.\u000a    The second principal impact of this research occurred subsequent to\u000a      Professor Cooke's appointment to the Law Commission, in May 2008, when its\u000a      findings proved to be instrumental in the development of the Commission's\u000a      Consultation Paper on Matrimonial Property Regimes (Corroborating\u000a        Source 2). This used the research to inform a discussion of the\u000a      potential for a qualifying prenuptial agreement, and to analyse reform in\u000a      England and Wales in the light of the law in neighbouring European\u000a      countries. Although uncited (due to Law Commission convention), Chapter 4\u000a      of the Law Commission document clearly draws heavily upon the comparative\u000a      basis of the research (the only relevant study), and the issues raised by\u000a      qualifying prenuptial agreements in Chapters 5 and 6 are evidently\u000a      informed by the findings from the empirical work carried out in the\u000a      comparator jurisdictions.\u000a    As the responsible Law Commissioner, Cooke is directly responsible for\u000a      the reform recommendations that will follow the Consultation (discussed in\u000a      Corroborating Source 7) and is well-positioned to implement policy\u000a      change based on the research findings; the intimacy of this connection\u000a      between research and policymaking illustrates the considerable\u000a      significance and depth of the project's impact. Callus served as a member\u000a      of the Law Commission's Advisory Board for the project and also submitted\u000a      a response to the consultation process (drawing on the earlier research).\u000a      This particularly focused on public support for the notion that the family\u000a      home should always be shared equally, irrespective of legal title or\u000a      contributions, thereby providing an additional pathway for the research\u000a      into the policy field (Corroborating Source 8).\u000a    The Law Commission Report that follows the 2011 Consultation Paper will,\u000a      in due course, propose draft legislation to implement any recommended\u000a      reforms. This is an ongoing process; the Law Commission published a\u000a      Supplementary Consultation Paper in September 2012 (Corroborating\u000a        Source 9), and is set to report on all aspects of matrimonial\u000a      property in late 2013\/early 2014. Both researchers remain heavily involved\u000a      in this process; Cooke as Law Commissioner and Callus via a working paper\u000a      submitted to the consultation process (Corroborating Source 10),\u000a      which the Law Commission expressly relied upon to inform discussion on how\u000a      English law on financial provision can be reformed (Corroborating\u000a        Source 9, p51). This constitutes a very significant influence on\u000a      policy made by government and quasi-government bodies, and it is unlikely\u000a      that the reform process or the direction of policy travel in this area\u000a      would be as it is but for the influence of Cooke and Callus' work.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The findings from a University of Reading research project have provided\u000a      a key evidential basis for law's ongoing development (via court decisions,\u000a      policy statements and statutory reform proposals) concerning financial\u000a      provision upon relationship breakdown. The project, which explored the\u000a      issue of community of property from a comparative perspective, produced\u000a      findings that assisted government and non-government decision-making\u000a      bodies in determining the value of different legal regimes in relation to\u000a      property disputes following domestic relationship breakdown.

This issue affects a substantial part of\u000a      the British population; in 2010, 16 per cent of all families contained\u000a      cohabiting couples, while 47 per cent comprised married\/civil partnered\u000a      couples (ONS 2011). Despite such statistics, family law does not provide\u000a      for property redistribution upon cohabitation breakdown, and the law\u000a      following divorce is the subject of much uncertainty due to wide judicial\u000a      discretion in the making of financial orders. Both the judiciary and the\u000a      Government have recognised that there is a need to reform the law on\u000a      financial provision (see Corroborating Sources 1 and 2), and it is\u000a      against this backdrop that the University of Reading's research was\u000a      conducted.\u000a    The project sought to investigate the benefits and disadvantages of a\u000a      European-style community of property regime as compared with the existing\u000a      system in England and Wales. As explained in Output One, Cooke,\u000a      Barlow and Callus found that \"In its most traditional form, community\u000a        of property provides for the automatic sharing of property and\u000a        liabilities during the relationship; and all forms of community of\u000a        property provide for a rule-based sharing of property when the community\u000a        is dissolved by divorce or death\" .This contrasts with the law in\u000a      England and Wales, which regards matrimonial property as individually held\u000a      by each partner and then subject to redistribution (but only in\u000a      the case of marriage) in a sometimes unpredictable way on separation.\u000a    A doctrinal analysis of the law in three comparator jurisdictions\u000a      (France, Sweden and the Netherlands) revealed the existence of very\u000a      different statutory matrimonial regimes, governing the financial\u000a      consequences of divorce via contractual agreement between parties and by\u000a      community-of-property principles. Building upon this foundation,\u000a      semi-structured interviews and case vignettes were carried out with 30\u000a      professional notaries across those jurisdictions in order to gauge user\u000a      experience. A clear picture emerged of the consequences of such regimes:\u000a      that community-of-property models reflected predominant social conceptions\u000a      of marriage as a partnership or joint venture; that, in all three\u000a      countries, the majority of couples simply fell within the default\u000a      community-of-property variant applicable; and that the concept of a\u000a      marital contract was accepted as the norm. These findings informed\u000a      subsequent, groundbreaking, empirical research in England and Wales on\u000a      user responses to the potential introduction of a type of community of\u000a      property regime for married and cohabiting couples. This research involved\u000a      semi-structured interviews with a random population sample of 74 married,\u000a      divorced or cohabiting interviewees, and found that there was support in\u000a      principle for a type of deferred community approach for division of the\u000a      family home, whether matrimonial or cohabiting, where children were\u000a      involved, and that the interests of children and their carers should be\u000a      paramount. The results of the research provide perhaps the only study of\u000a      public perceptions in this area, and a unique English-language study of\u000a      practices in other jurisdictions. Consequently, the research was ideally\u000a      placed to inform potential law reform in England and Wales.\u000a    * Cooke has been on secondment from the University of Reading\u000a      to the Law Commission for the period 2008-2014.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39752","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Torture Team research successfully challenged the narrative of the\u000d\u000a      US administration around the legality and use of \"enhanced interrogation\u000d\u000a      techniques\" (torture) on detainees at Guantanamo Bay.

In early 2008 an unpublished draft of Sands's\u000d\u000a        Vanity Fair article, \"The Green Light\" [3], based on his\u000d\u000a        research, was made available to the Chair of the US House of\u000d\u000a        Representatives Judiciary Committee, Congressman John Conyers Jr.\u000d\u000a        Congress then convened hearings to address the role of Bush\u000d\u000a        Administration lawyers in torture [1], and as a result of his research\u000d\u000a        findings, Sands was invited to testify before the US Committee on 6 May\u000d\u000a        2008 [1, p. 83] and 15 July 2008 [2]. Sands's Vanity Fair\u000d\u000a        article became part of the official congressional investigation [1 p.\u000d\u000a        9], was published in full in the official Congressional record [1, p.\u000d\u000a        87], and was relied upon by the Congressional Committee to identify\u000d\u000a        which Bush Administration officials would be subpoenaed to testify\u000d\u000a        before Congress in the Guantanamo Bay hearings [1, p. 108]. As a result\u000d\u000a        David Addington, Chief of Staff to the Vice President, and Douglas\u000d\u000a        Feith, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy for President Bush,\u000d\u000a        were subpoenaed and appeared before Congress. Both Addington [4, pp. 45,\u000d\u000a        56, 165] and Feith [5, pp. 2, 5, 7, 8, 9] were questioned by Congress\u000d\u000a        specifically about evidence presented in Torture Team on their\u000d\u000a        involvement in authorising torture. These investigations publicly\u000d\u000a        exposed how US law and the Geneva Conventions had been set aside by Bush\u000d\u000a        Administration lawyers, reiterated US commitment to the Conventions and\u000d\u000a        generated calls for a criminal investigation or public inquiry into the\u000d\u000a        actions of these officials.\u000d\u000a      \u000aSpanish Prosecutions: Torture Team led directly to two\u000d\u000a        judicial investigations in Spain [6]. In March 2009 a criminal\u000d\u000a        investigation was opened on six Bush Administration legal advisers,\u000d\u000a        alleging that these officials had enabled and abetted torture by\u000d\u000a        justifying the abuse of terrorism suspects. Gonzalo Boye, the Spanish\u000d\u000a        lawyer who initiated the investigation, said of Professor Sands, \"let\u000d\u000a          me just say that he played a very big role in my thinking. His book\u000d\u000a          showed me who the targets were\" [7]. In April 2011 the case was\u000d\u000a        stayed by a Spanish court; that decision was appealed and the case is\u000d\u000a        currently before the Spanish Constitutional Court. In a separate case\u000d\u000a        launched in April 2009, the Spanish courts are investigating allegations\u000d\u000a        that four former Guantanamo detainees who are Spanish citizens,\u000d\u000a        residents or subject to Spanish legal proceedings were tortured. This\u000d\u000a        case draws on Torture Team research and is on-going [6].\u000d\u000a      In 2011 Human Rights Watch, an international non-governmental\u000d\u000a        organization, published the report, Getting Away With Torture: The\u000d\u000a          Bush Administration and Mistreatment of Detainees, arguing that\u000d\u000a        sufficient grounds exist for the US government to order a broad criminal\u000d\u000a        investigation into alleged crimes committed in connection with the\u000d\u000a        torture and ill-treatment of detainees, the CIA secret detention\u000d\u000a        programme, and the rendition of detainees to torture. Sands's Torture\u000a          Team research was frequently cited and used as authority in this\u000d\u000a        report [9, pp.14, 40, 42, 79].\u000d\u000a      Following the Human Rights Watch report, The Constitution\u000d\u000a            Project's Task Force on Detainee Treatment, a US\u000d\u000a        independent bipartisan panel, was charged with examining the US\u000d\u000a        government's policies and actions related to the capture, detention and\u000d\u000a        treatment of suspected terrorists during the Clinton, Bush and Obama\u000d\u000a        administrations. The Project's 2013 report, Detainee Treatment,\u000d\u000a        relied on Sands's research to provide authority for the finding that the\u000d\u000a        US government engaged in torture [8, cited 13 times].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Worldwide debate and communication: Sands's research changed the\u000d\u000a      narrative about torture in the US by putting the emphasis on the role of a\u000d\u000a      small group of politically-appointed lawyers who were able to by-pass the\u000d\u000a      normal decision-making processes, including those within the military. His\u000d\u000a      research has been communicated to millions of people on an international\u000d\u000a      scale, through the large number and wide variety of mediums that have\u000d\u000a      reported the findings [10]. As well as extensive international press and\u000d\u000a      media coverage, the Torture Team research has also made the rare\u000d\u000a      crossover into the arts and been the subject of a number of dramatic\u000d\u000a      performances.\u000d\u000a    Media coverage: The Torture Team book has sold\u000d\u000a      internationally in excess of 25,000 copies and was nominated for the\u000d\u000a      Orwell Prize in 2009 [11]. Professor Sands also wrote four articles on his\u000d\u000a      research for Vanity Fair [3,12], with international circulation of\u000d\u000a      over 1.1 million [18]. The research was reported and discussed extensively\u000d\u000a      in the international media [10]. Notable examples in worldwide print and\u000d\u000a      online journalism include: Huffington Post; Newsweek Magazine;\u000d\u000a      The New York Times; Financial Times; Guardian; The\u000a        Times; Der Spiegel [10]. Sands's findings received\u000d\u000a      significant international television and radio coverage, including: US\u000d\u000a      National Public Radio show Fresh Air (listening figures of 4.5\u000d\u000a      million) [13]; a Democracy Now! interview aired on over 700 US\u000d\u000a      stations [13]; and a Russia Today interview viewed on YouTube over\u000d\u000a      11,000 times [13].\u000d\u000a    Public engagement and cultural artefacts: Sands's research\u000d\u000a      catalysed numerous large-scale public events designed for non-lawyers,\u000d\u000a      engaging members of the general public with the research findings and\u000d\u000a      increasing understanding of this vital human rights issue. This began in\u000d\u000a      2008 when Sands was invited to discuss his research findings in The Hay\u000d\u000a      Festival of Literature and Arts Festival [14]. Unusually for academic\u000d\u000a      research, Torture Team inspired the creation of several artistic\u000d\u000a      and cultural artefacts. The research was adapted into dramatic\u000d\u000a      performances, including plays attended by several thousand people and\u000d\u000a      starring some of the world's leading stage and film actors: in May 2008 at\u000d\u000a      London's Tricycle Theatre, with a cast that included Joanna Lumley, Corin\u000d\u000a      Redgrave and Vanessa Redgrave [15]; in January 2011 at the Long Wharf\u000d\u000a      Theatre, New Haven (USA) that included an interactive audience discussion\u000d\u000a      with Sands following the performance [16]; and a performance at the Hay\u000d\u000a      Festival, with a cast including Ralph Fiennes, Gillian Anderson and Damien\u000d\u000a      Lewis, which was podcast on the Hay Festival website [17].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Torture Team Project has directly influenced international\u000d\u000a      legal proceedings, government investigations and worldwide public debate\u000d\u000a      on the legality of the treatment of suspected terrorists.

The research is based on an in-depth analysis of official\u000d\u000a      documents and personal interviews with key members of the US military and\u000d\u000a      Bush Administration carried out by Sands in 2006-07. Torture Team\u000d\u000a      [a], published in the UK and US in 2008-09, examines how the US Military\u000d\u000a      went from using interrogations strictly regulated by federal law, the US\u000d\u000a      Army Field Manual 34-52 and the Geneva Conventions to allowing severe\u000d\u000a      interrogation techniques including sleep deprivation, forced nudity,\u000d\u000a      stress positions and water boarding.\u000d\u000a    Following the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, a number of\u000d\u000a      legal memoranda authorising the legality of \"enhanced interrogation\u000d\u000a      methods\" which contravened US law and the Geneva Conventions were written\u000d\u000a      by senior legal advisers in the Bush Administration. These memos paved the\u000d\u000a      way for the use of enhanced techniques on detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Abu\u000d\u000a      Ghraib and other locations outside the US, and led to the death of two\u000d\u000a      detainees and the torture of others. The US Supreme Court subsequently\u000d\u000a      ruled that Guantanamo detainees were entitled to the protections of the\u000d\u000a      Geneva Conventions and violations of it were war crimes.\u000d\u000a    Sands's earlier research, Lawless World (2005-06) [c], put the\u000d\u000a      issue of the legality of the Iraq war firmly on the British political\u000d\u000a      agenda. Then from September 2006 to September 2007 Sands researched\u000d\u000a      official documents in the US Library of Congress and conducted hundreds of\u000d\u000a      hours of interviews with a large number of high-ranking lawyers and\u000d\u000a      officials in the US military and the Bush Administration at the centre of\u000d\u000a      drafting and implementing legal memos authorising torture. Professor\u000d\u000a      Sands's reputation as a leading expert in public international law enabled\u000d\u000a      him to gain access to officials with direct involvement in critical\u000d\u000a      decisions on US interrogation policy, including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      William J.

Vogler\u000d\u000a      has actively promoted this approach through numerous consultancies over\u000d\u000a      recent years, on behalf of the Council of Europe, the European Union and\u000d\u000a      the US Department of Justice. He has worked as an adviser to drafting\u000d\u000a      committees and justice ministries in many countries of Eastern Europe, the\u000d\u000a      Caucasus and Eurasia, including Ukraine (where he was awarded the national\u000d\u000a      Medal of Honour for services to the drafting committee which produced the\u000d\u000a      2012 Criminal Procedure Code). He has also been able to articulate these\u000d\u000a      principles in summer schools and training sessions to legislators and\u000d\u000a      justice officials in the region on behalf of the Organisation for Security\u000d\u000a      and Co-operation in Europe\/Office for Democratic Reform and Human Rights.\u000d\u000a    But the opportunity for the most sustained and focused application of\u000d\u000a      this approach was in Georgia, during a period of rapid and radical\u000d\u000a      transition over the last decade. In 2002 this former Soviet republic was\u000d\u000a      amongst the most crime-ridden, dangerous and corrupt countries in the\u000d\u000a      world. By 2011, at the conclusion of the criminal-justice reform process\u000d\u000a      undertaken by the Sakaashvili government, it was found by the Former\u000d\u000a      Director of Crime Prevention at the United Nations Office on Drugs and\u000d\u000a      Crime, Jan Van Dijk, that the country had metamorphosed into one of the\u000d\u000a      safest countries in the Western world.\u000d\u000a    Items 1-3: Articulating Principle and Identifying Imbalance\u000d\u000a    In 2002, on behalf of the British Council, Vogler was the adviser to a\u000d\u000a      group of NGO\/opposition activists in Tbilisi developing a critique of the\u000d\u000a      Shevardnadze government's proposed redraft of the Criminal Procedure Code\u000d\u000a      (CPC). The critique that was advanced drew on Vogler's international\u000d\u000a      research and in particular focused on the failure of the draft to address\u000d\u000a      the endemic problems of state torture and corruption and the dominance in\u000d\u000a      all stages of authoritarian Soviet-style inquisitoriality. Vogler chaired\u000d\u000a      meetings between opposition NGOs, the drafting committee and government\u000d\u000a      ministers in 2002-03 in which these critiques were forcefully made by the\u000d\u000a      opposition group. Vogler's group eventually managed to convince\u000d\u000a      representatives of the Council of Europe to withdraw their support for the\u000d\u000a      draft proposals and they were abandoned.\u000d\u000a    Item 4: Correcting the Imbalances\u000d\u000a    Criminal justice reform was at the heart of the reform agenda identified\u000d\u000a      by the new Saakashvili government after the `Rose Revolution' in 2003.\u000d\u000a      With the support of the American Bar Association and the US Department of\u000d\u000a      Justice, Vogler served as a principal overseas adviser to a small\u000d\u000a      government working group drafting the new CPC in 2005\/2006 and made\u000d\u000a      numerous visits to Tbilisi to assist in the drafting process and to\u000d\u000a      present and commend the proposals to the Georgian Parliament. The\u000d\u000a      provisions on arrest (Arts 170-76), pre-trial release (Arts 5, 196-208),\u000d\u000a      and non-compulsion of witnesses (Arts 49-50) represented principled\u000d\u000a      attempts to reinvigorate adversarial elements in the pre-trial. The\u000d\u000a      establishment of jury trial (Arts 219-24, 226, 231-36) was an attempt to\u000d\u000a      introduce more popular justice in the trial phase. The innovations were\u000d\u000a      all the outcome of debates in which Vogler was able to provide extensive\u000d\u000a      data on practice elsewhere, directly from his `World View' research.\u000d\u000a    In 2009 Vogler was asked by the Council of Europe to assess the draft for\u000d\u000a      conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights and to develop\u000d\u000a      further critiques which were presented at the `Experts Review Panel on the\u000d\u000a      Georgian CPC' in Paris in February 2009 and which led to a number of\u000d\u000a      amendments. The CPC was finally enacted by the Georgian Parliament in\u000d\u000a      November 2009 and, in December 2010, Vogler was invited by the Council of\u000d\u000a      Europe to present recommendations on the implementation of the Code to the\u000d\u000a      Georgian Justice Minister and representatives of the Ministry of Justice\u000d\u000a      at a round-table meeting in Strasbourg.

This has involved\u000d\u000a      detailed evaluation of the historical and contemporary research data as\u000d\u000a      well as personal engagement in the reform process in countries as diverse\u000d\u000a      as Kyrgyzstan, Brazil and Malawi. The outcome has been the development of\u000d\u000a      a theory of criminal justice reform, first set out in 2005, which is\u000d\u000a      intended to have a direct, practical impact on the process. It envisages\u000d\u000a      the criminal trial as the location in which disputes between the three\u000d\u000a      Aristotelian social orders (the state, the community and the individual)\u000d\u000a      can be worked out and resolved. The participation of these three elements\u000d\u000a      is associated by Vogler with the global methodologies of inquisitorial\u000d\u000a      justice, popular justice and adversarial justice respectively. His\u000d\u000a      research has traced the history of each trial mode from its origins to the\u000d\u000a      present day. As a result he is able to show that that criminal justice\u000d\u000a      reform should not (as hitherto) be based upon donor influence, treasury\u000d\u000a      demands or sheer expediency but, instead, requires a strong theoretical\u000d\u000a      basis. In short, for a criminal justice system to achieve its purpose in\u000d\u000a      resolving social conflict, none of the three social orders should be\u000d\u000a      excluded from the procedure.\u000d\u000a    This analysis has important practical implications for the design of\u000d\u000a      criminal-justice reform programmes, requiring that the three major\u000d\u000a      methodologies should be engaged sequentially but never to the exclusion of\u000d\u000a      the others. Inquisitoriality should be dominant in the pre-trial,\u000d\u000a      adversariality in the trial and popular justice in the phase of judgement.\u000d\u000a      An imbalance between these elements, or the radical exclusion of one or\u000d\u000a      other (as for example, the exclusion of adversariality in Soviet criminal\u000d\u000a      justice or popular justice from the International Criminal Court) would\u000d\u000a      therefore fatally undermine the essential function of criminal justice.\u000d\u000a    In published work, Vogler has applied this perspective to an analysis of\u000d\u000a      contemporary reform practices around the world, especially in Europe, and\u000d\u000a      to the international criminal courts.\u000d\u000a    The practical implications of this work for criminal justice reform are\u000d\u000a      as follows:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Criminal justice reform should be based on clearly articulated\u000d\u000a        principle, not on expediency or donor influence.\u000d\u000a      There should be a balance in any given system, based on sequential\u000d\u000a        engagement through the process, between the three trial procedures: the\u000d\u000a        inquisitorial (authoritarian, forensic methods), the adversarial\u000d\u000a        (individual, rights-based forms) and popular justice (democratic\u000d\u000a        participation).\u000d\u000a      It is important in any reform process first to identify the existing\u000d\u000a        imbalances and discontinuities between different trial modes in the\u000d\u000a        unreformed procedure.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Reform measures should be aimed primarily at correcting these imbalances\u000d\u000a      at each stage.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39890","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"617790","Name":"Moldova"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"3595528","Name":"Guatemala"},{"GeoNamesId":"3595528","Name":"Guatemala"},{"GeoNamesId":"3932488","Name":"Peru"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    4. 1. Shaping and influencing EU policy and legislation\u000a      In developing the roadmap on procedural rights the EC accepted the\u000a      findings in 3.1 that existing European Convention on Human Rights\u000a      (ECHR) standards were not met in practice. The interim results of 3.4\u000a      were presented at an EU Experts Meeting in March 2009, attended by\u000a      delegates from most EU Member States as well as senior EU civil servants,\u000a      and were critical at this stage in promoting the need for the Roadmap.\u000a      Following adoption of the roadmap, an Impact Assessment was commissioned\u000a      in preparation for issuing each proposed Directive under the Roadmap, and\u000a      the research in 3.1 and\/or 3.4 was cited as a major source\u000a      of information in each of the three impact assessments published to date (5.2,\u000a      5.3, and 5.4). Further, as a result of the research, Ed\u000a      Cape was retained as an expert for the impact assessment of the proposed\u000a      Directive on Safeguards for Children and other Vulnerable Persons in\u000a      Criminal Proceedings. The lead EU civil servant responsible for major\u000a      aspects of the legislative programme, and who represented the Commission\u000a      in the negotiations, said that she `routinely used both Suspects in\u000a        Europe and Effective Criminal Defence in Europe'. She said\u000a      of the latter that it was the `\"bible\" for the negotiations, and certainly\u000a      when it was cited, that tended to be the end of the argument as it was\u000a      recognised as being the leading study in the field, and wholly reliable' (5.1).\u000a      The influence of the research studies is also evidenced by the fact that\u000a      the EU commissioned further research from Cape and others, `Procedural\u000a      Rights for Suspects in Police Detention in the EU: Empirical investigation\u000a      and promoting best practice' (2011 - 2013, 332,934 Euros), to develop\u000a      knowledge and understanding of how the procedural rights governed by the\u000a      Directives work in practice\u000a    4. 2. Improving policy-makers' understanding of deficiencies\u000a        in national laws, policies and practices\u000a      Professor Cape, and other members of the research teams, has been invited\u000a      to present the findings of the research at a large number of conferences\u000a      and similar events organised by the EU and government ministries,\u000a      promoting debate and influencing the implementation of European standards\u000a      concerning procedural rights amongst politicians, policy-makers and civil\u000a      servants. These include conferences organised by the German Ministry of\u000a      Justice (Berlin, 6 September 2010), the Helsinki Foundation for Human\u000a      Rights in Poland (Warsaw, 4 April 2011), the Polish Presidency of the EU\u000a      (Warsaw, 5-6 December 2011), and the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine\/US\u000a      Department of Justice (Kiev, 13 December 2012)\u000a    The Carloway Review, established by the Scottish Executive to examine the\u000a      implications of the Supreme Court decision in Cadder v HMA for\u000a      Scots law and procedure, made explicit reference to the findings of the\u000a      research (3.4) in informing its understanding of defence rights in\u000a      EU Member States (5.5)\u000a    4. 3.

This built on extensive prior\u000a      research by Cape, including on criminal legal aid contracting and an\u000a      evaluation of the pilot Public Defender Service in England and Wales (see\u000a        3.2 and 3.3). Conscious of the lack of empirical research on\u000a      procedural rights across EU jurisdictions, and recognising the value of\u000a      the first study, the EC commissioned a second piece of research which was\u000a      designed to provide evidence of: (a) the level of formal compliance by\u000a      Members States with ECHR standards and those to be considered for adoption\u000a      by the EU; (b) the level of compliance in practice; (c) the legal,\u000a      institutional and cultural factors critical in achieving compliance; and\u000a      (d) the interrelationship between ECHR and EU standards. This research\u000a      project (2007-2010) (see 3.4) broke new ground in conducting\u000a      comparative research on access to effective criminal defence in nine\u000a      European jurisdictions.\u000a    The research established:\u000a    2.1 that whilst the law of most (although not all) countries\u000a      complied with ECHR standards regarding procedural rights, there was\u000a      significant lack of compliance in practice, particularly at the\u000a      investigative stage;\u000a    2.2 that the police in most countries adopt a range of\u000a      rights-avoidance mechanisms, in respect of which enforcement mechanisms\u000a      were inadequate;\u000a    2.3 the importance of detailed regulations and procedures, and\u000a      effective enforcement mechanisms, in ensuring that procedural rights are\u000a      complied with;\u000a    2.4 the significance of the cultural practices and attitudes of\u000a      criminal justice professionals in ensuring that procedural rights are\u000a      respected;\u000a    2.5 that EU legislation, enforced by the European Court of\u000a      Justice, was likely to be more effective in establishing clear and\u000a      appropriate standards, and in ensuring compliance, than the ECHR.\u000a    The findings were crucial in helping the EU to determine what approach\u000a      should be adopted in the EU programme of reform, what reforms in Member\u000a      States would be necessary in order to comply with the EU Directives\u000a      resulting from the Roadmap, and what mechanisms would be necessary to\u000a      ensure compliance with that legislation.\u000a    In a further study, `Effective defence rights in LARN member countries'\u000a      (2010-2012), Cape was commissioned by the Open Society Justice Initiative\u000a      (OSJI, an international NGO) to develop the research methodology used in\u000a      the second study in order to examine access to effective criminal defence\u000a      in five eastern European jurisdictions (see 3.5).\u000a    Cape played a central role in the research design, implementation and\u000a      analysis in all of the studies, as well as in writing up the research.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39896","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"2440476","Name":"Niger"},{"GeoNamesId":"2287781","Name":"Ivory Coast"},{"GeoNamesId":"2464461","Name":"Tunisia"},{"GeoNamesId":"174982","Name":"Armenia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    4.1 Contribution towards improving FTG's (employees, agents,\u000a        partners and subsidiaries) understanding of the regulatory environment\u000a        relating to mobile money in Jordan, Egypt, the Ivory Coast, the United\u000a        Kingdom, the United States and internationally\u000a    As a result of the research and advice provided to FTG, they were able to\u000a      expand, cultivate, promote and explore new business opportunities in\u000a      Jordan, Egypt and the Ivory Coast. FTG realised a competitive advantage\u000a      with considerable expert knowledge (in the area of banking regulation and\u000a      AML) when negotiating with telecoms operators in those three\u000a      jurisdictions, providing a superior negotiating position and strategic\u000a      competitive advantage. Therefore, the research contributed towards\u000a      improving FTG's (employees, agents, partners and subsidiaries)\u000a      understanding of the regulatory environment relating to mobile money in\u000a      Jordan, Egypt, and the Ivory Coast, and of the applicability of United\u000a      Kingdom, United States and international banking regulation in this field.\u000a      The combination of factors that led to FTG winning contracts in excess of\u000a      &#8364;5m included the strong international brand of FTG, the expertise within\u000a      the bidding team (that included representation from the FTG's Fraud and\u000a      Revenue Assurance team which had commissioned the research from the UWE\u000a      team), and the assurance of AML compliance which had been provided by the\u000a      commissioned research.\u000a    The exact value and details of these contracts cannot be disclosed due to\u000a      a strict confidentiality agreement to which UWE were party. However, the\u000a      fact that the UWE research team were chosen to conduct two specific pieces\u000a      of work, worth in excess of &#8364;50,000, is evidence that FTG saw considerable\u000a      value in the engagement. The former Knowledge Management Director with the\u000a      France Telecom Group, has commented that whilst the financial impact of\u000a      the research is `impossible to precisely define', `France Telecom realised\u000a      a considerable competitive advantage with expert knowledge when\u000a      negotiating with telecom operators in the [relevant] territories' [see\u000a      5.1]\u000a    4.2 Improving awareness of compliance obligations as they\u000a        relate to mobile money applications\u000a    The research project informed FTG of all of the risks associated with\u000a      money laundering and banking operations in Jordan, Egypt and the Ivory\u000a      Coast. This contributed to the realisation of the following further\u000a      benefits:\u000a    4.2.1 FTG were able to launch new Mobile Money services in\u000a      Tunisia, Niger, Armenia and Uganda\u000a    4.2.2 FTG were able to continue to manage and limit the threat\u000a      posed by, and the associated financial costs of, fraud and revenue\u000a      assurance within acceptable levels (this figure is approximately between\u000a      0.5-3 per cent of revenues, but cannot be disclosed precisely because of\u000a      the confidentiality agreement) by focusing their operational efforts on\u000a      fraud and leakage items causing repeated costs. Examples include call\u000a      reselling, roaming fraud, telesales fraud, subscription fraud, SAC related\u000a      fraud costs, and leakage resulting from change management (including\u000a      governance of fraud risk acceptance). In particular, the findings and\u000a      conclusions of the research conducted by Ryder and Turksen resulted in FTG\u000a      identifying low levels of fraud compliance under obligations imposed by\u000a      the then Financial Services Authority under its Senior\u000a        Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls (SYSC) Handbook\u000a    4.2.3 the UWE findings assisted the FTG to achieve these important\u000a      goals by not only identifying the relevant banking, AML and fraud\u000a      regulations that they were required to comply with, but also by advising\u000a      them regarding best practice\u000a    4.2.4 industry standards usually quote fraud and revenue leakage\u000a      as affecting between 5- 15 per cent of revenue, depending on geographical\u000a      location. As a result of the research conducted by Ryder and Turksen the\u000a      FTG were able to continue to maintain their very low level of fraud and\u000a      leakage. This was beneficial to the FTG as it enabled them not only to\u000a      fully comply with the relevant banking, AML and fraud regulations, but by\u000a      also give them a superior competitive advantage, supported by the\u000a      provision of expert legal knowledge transfer. As the then Knowledge\u000a      Management Director, Group Fraud and Revenue Assurance, France Telecom\u000a      Group, has attested, `The impact and benefit [derived from the work] was\u000a      that France Telecom realised a considerable competitive advantage with\u000a      expert knowledge when negotiating with telecom operators in the named\u000a      territories providing a superior negotiating position and strategic\u000a      competitive advantage'\u000a    The former Head of Global Development for Orange has said of the research\u000a      that it `made a significant contribution to the international success of\u000a      France Telecom\/Orange, not least by improving understanding of the\u000a      regulatory environment relating to mobile money applications in a range of\u000a      countries, and improving awareness of compliance obligations as they\u000a      related to mobile money' [see 5.2]\u000a    4.3 Providing a foundation for FTG anti-fraud policy\u000a    The research findings were utilised by the FTG to form part of its\u000a      counter-fraud strategy documentation.

Mobile banking is seen as a potential area of growth for\u000a      many telecommunications companies. FTG approached Professor Nicholas Ryder\u000a      (then Associate Professor in Financial Crime, appointed 2006) and Dr Umut\u000a      Turksen (then Senior Lecturer in Law, appointed 2005) to conduct research\u000a      in the area of national and international banking regulation and its\u000a      applicability to mobile banking. This built on the body of research\u000a      conducted by Ryder on banking regulation and white collar crime in the UK\u000a      and EU. The key findings and conclusions of that body of research related\u000a      to the creation and development of a global anti-money laundering policy (3.1\u000a      below), comparison of related white collar crime strategies in the US and\u000a      UK (3.2 below), the jurisdictional scope and applicability of the\u000a      enforcement powers of UK financial regulatory agencies (3.3 below),\u000a      and the enforcement policies adopted in the US towards breaches of its\u000a      white collar crime and banking regulations (3.4 below).\u000a    FTG posed six specific research questions:\u000a    1) Do FTG activities in Jordan, Egypt and the Ivory Coast constitute a\u000a      banking activity which falls within the regulatory environment?\u000a    2) Are there any other activities that FTG needs to consider to avoid\u000a      meeting any banking regulation?\u000a    3) If FTG were to require a banking licence, what are the key regulations\u000a      that would be applicable?\u000a    4) Is the legislation and related regulations the same in all three\u000a      countries?\u000a    5) What are the consequences for non-compliance or part-compliance in\u000a      each of the three jurisdictions?\u000a    6) Are there minimum standards of compliance?\u000a    This research was ground-breaking in that it involved comparative\u000a      research on mobile banking and its regulation in Jordan, Egypt and the\u000a      Ivory Coast.

The scale and\u000a      significance of the amendments can be shown by comparing cl.5(1) of the\u000a      original draft Bill and\u000a      s.7(1) as it became:\u000a    Cl.5(1): A ... commercial organisation (\"C\") is guilty ... under this\u000a      section if &#8212; (a) a person\u000a      (\"A\") performing services for or on behalf of C bribes another person, (b)\u000a      the bribe was in\u000a      connection with C's business, and (c) a responsible person, or a number of\u000a      such persons\u000a      taken together, was negligent in failing to prevent the bribe.\u000a    S.7(1): A ... commercial organisation (\"C\") is guilty of an offence ...\u000a      if a person (\"A\")\u000a      associated with C bribes another person intending &#8212; (a) to obtain or\u000a      retain business for C, or\u000a      (b) to obtain or retain an advantage in the conduct of business for C\u000a    These significant changes came about as a result of Wells' written and\u000a      oral evidence (in May.2009)\u000a      before the joint House of Commons\/House of Lords legislative Scrutiny\u000a      Committee, which she was\u000a      invited to give because of her national and international expertise in the\u000a      field [a]. She used [3] to\u000a      argue that the corporate liability provision in the Bill was unnecessarily\u000a      restrictive and complex; did\u000a      not comply with the OECD convention; and unusually required both negligent\u000a      failure to supervise\u000a      and a lack of procedural due diligence ([a], Q115).\u000a    The Committee noted that Wells had \"... played your role already\u000a        behind the scenes in getting this\u000a        legislation into a draft form\" ([a], Q75). She went on to play a\u000a      further decisive role \"behind closed\u000a      doors\", when the Committee raised a further query by way of supplementary\u000a      question asking\u000a      whether \"removing the requirement to prove negligence under clause 5 would\u000a      be unfair to\u000a      businesses and mark a step change from any comparable criminal offence (Qq\u000a      61-64).? Wells\u000a      responded that \"... the debate about corporate liability starts from\u000a        the wrong foot or premise. A\u000a        company's liability for the acts of its employees is appropriate &#8212; and\u000a        this is particularly applicable in\u000a        the bribery context &#8212; because those acts benefit the company, those acts\u000a        are undertaken with\u000a        company resources (where does the money for the bribe come from? who\u000a        signs the contracts?\u000a        where do the profits end up? The answer in each case is `the business')\u000a        and companies are\u000a        peculiarly equipped to supervise and monitor the acts of their employees\u000a        and agents\" [i].\u000a    The Committee accepted her arguments, noting \"we are concerned by the\u000a        focus on whether a\u000a        `responsible person' was negligent, rather than on the collective\u000a        failure of the company to ensure\u000a        that adequate anti-bribery procedures were in place. In our view,\u000a        clauses 5 and 6 introduce a\u000a        narrow and complex solution to a pressing problem. We therefore\u000a        recommend the removal of the\u000a        need to prove negligence under clause 5(1)(c)\" [a], para 89. In\u000a      adopting the Committee's\u000a      suggestions, the Government agreed \"that there may be a risk that\u000a        requiring the prosecution to\u000a        prove negligence may involve unnecessary complexity and may have the\u000a        potential to undermine\u000a        the broad policy objectives of bringing about a shift away from a\u000a        corporate culture that is more\u000a        tolerant of bribery and promoting effective corporate anti-bribery\u000a        procedures\" [h], para 9. The\u000a      requirement to prove negligence was removed.\u000a    Thus, there was a comprehensive re-drafting of the relevant provision\u000a      which, subject to an\u000a      adequate procedures defence, renders corporations liable for bribery\u000a      offences by their employees\u000a      and agents. Lord Goodhart, a member of that Committee, made the following\u000a      observation\u000a      regarding Wells' contribution in the oral hearing ([a], Q112):\u000a    I found Professor Wells' suggestion on how to deal with corporate\u000a        offences very\u000a        persuasive, namely that there should be vicarious liability with the\u000a        company being liable for\u000a        any bribery committed by anybody acting on their behalf with a due\u000a        diligence defence...'.\u000a    The final report of the Joint Committee includes numerous citations to\u000a      Wells' evidence ([a]) and its\u000a      recommendations, particularly as regards the corporate bribery offence,\u000a      drew heavily on Wells'\u000a      evidence (eg at paras 41, 89-90, 103, 138). The final provisions of the\u000a      Act therefore owe a\u000a      considerable debt to Wells' research as they reflect her specific critique\u000a      and brought the UK into\u000a      line with the OECD Convention as she had suggested. For example, Monty\u000a      Raphael QC, General\u000a      Counsel, Peters &amp; Peters, who also gave oral evidence to the\u000a      Committee, commented that\u000a    Were it not for your reworking of Clause 7 of the Bribery Bill 2010,\u000a        it would not have\u000a        received the Parliamentary support it did. Section 7 as it became is a\u000a        testament to your\u000a        scholarship and innovation, drawing upon your well deserved reputation\u000a        as the authority on\u000a        comparative corporate criminal responsibility. This section is destined\u000a        to become the\u000a        \"offence of choice\" for prosecutions in the area of corporate bribery.\u000a      ([c])\u000a    The Chairman of the OECD Working Group on Bribery in International\u000a      Business transactions has\u000a      also noted how Wells \"clearly influenced\" the section of the\u000a      Bribery Act 2010 so that it now\u000a      complies with the requirements of the OECD's Anti-Bribery Convention\u000a      ([f]).\u000a    The international reach and significance of the corporate offence in the\u000a      UK Bribery Act has\u000a      triggered compliance responses from multinational corporations as a result\u000a      of its reverse onus\u000a      adequate procedures defence and because of its wide extra territorial\u000a      effect. Companies are\u000a      advised by Transparency International, among others, that compliance with\u000a      the UK Act goes\u000a      beyond that required under the US Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act 1977:\u000a    The Bribery Act ... presents heightened liability risks for companies,\u000a        directors and\u000a        individuals. To avoid corporate liability for bribery, companies must\u000a        make sure that they\u000a        have strong, up-to-date and effective anti-bribery policies and systems.\u000a      [j]\u000a    2. Major influence on OECD and International Bar Association\u000a    Beyond this specific and direct contribution to impact on domestic\u000a      legislation, Wells has\u000a      significantly influenced the international agenda in other respects.\u000a    She has worked with the OECD to develop its Anti-Corruption Initiative in\u000a      the corporate context.\u000a      Corporate liability is unfamiliar to many of the 40 Anti Bribery\u000a      Convention signatory states and her\u000a      expertise formed the basis of discussion at the high-level,\u000a      invitation-only event organised by the\u000a      OECD across South East Asia in September 2010. This was attended by a\u000a      range of government\u000a      anti-corruption representatives and other non-academic policy-makers\u000a      ([g]). The invitation was\u000a      issued to Wells in reflection of her contribution to the foundation of the\u000a      OECD approach to bribery\u000a      and corruption: \"We believe that you would be able to give the members\u000a        of the `Initiative' an\u000a        important basis for beginning their legislative work on legal persons'\u000a        liability under the UNCAC\"\u000a      ([b]).\u000a    Finally, her impact extends to developments in international law in\u000a      respect of corporate complicity\u000a      in human rights violations and to the work of the International Bar\u000a      Association's Human Rights\u000a      Institute's Task Force on Tax Havens, Poverty and Human Rights. Wells was\u000a      appointed a member\u000a      of this international task force in 2012. Wells' input occurred during the\u000a      REF period and specifically\u000a      used her research on remedies [1], [4] and [5] to develop the Task Force\u000a      recommendations around\u000a      corporate responsibilities. Thus, the research directly influenced the\u000a      work of the Taskforce and her\u000a      \"... input was of crucial importance ...\" and \"... has\u000a        considerably shaped the Taskforce\u000a        deliberations as well as the recommendations in the final report\".\u000a      In 2012, the Task Force met in\u000a      London and, Dublin; in June 2012, Wells contributed to the high level\u000a      multi-stakeholder\u000a      consultation event in Latin America by leading the evidence and feedback\u000a      sessions held by the\u000a      Task Force ([e]). The stakeholder meeting included lawyers,\u000a      representatives of international\u000a      institutions, revenue administration and NGOs from Brazil, Colombia,\u000a      Bolivia, Peru and Argentina.\u000a      Wells' presentation is an Appendix in the final Report.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Wells' research on corporate liability led to direct changes to UK law in\u000a      the Bribery Act 2010 and\u000a      has begun to have significant impact internationally.

Since appointment to the University of Bristol Law School\u000a      in January 2009, she has\u000a      produced a further body of theoretical work in the field of corporate\u000a      criminal liability as well as in its\u000a      application to the specific field of bribery ([1]-[5]), and for which she\u000a      was awarded a Leverhulme\u000a      research fellowship in March 2010 [6]. Her work straddles both domestic\u000a      and international aspects\u000a      of criminal law as well as the interrelation between them. In [1], she\u000a      explored the interface\u000a      between the regulation and deterrence of corporate crime, arguing that\u000a      legal responses were\u000a      incoherent, as they were torn between criminal deterrence and regulation\u000a      via negotiated civil\u000a      penalties.\u000a    This analysis was then applied in order to draw attention to the failure\u000a      of the UK government to\u000a      comply with the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention's requirements in relation to\u000a      corporate liability. Her\u000a      critical commentary on the draft Bribery Bill 2009 ([3]) was submitted as\u000a      Written Evidence to the\u000a      Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Committee.\u000a    As regards corporate criminal liability for economic offences in general,\u000a      Wells makes the innovative\u000a      argument that the Serious Fraud Office's approach has shifted towards\u000a      negotiation and settlement\u000a      as if this is a regulatory infraction, by-passing the usual models of\u000a      criminal law ([1]). Wells points\u000a      out that on its face the Bribery Act 2010 is at odds with the better\u000a      regulation rhetoric and the UK as\u000a      providing a patchwork of answers to the difficult questions about\u000a      regulatory-criminal law\u000a      interactions. Indeed, she argues that although the corporate offence\u000a      provision in the Bribery Act\u000a      2010 \"talks\" tough, it provides neither the full story (as corporations\u000a      had been responding to\u000a      international and other pressures for a good few years in any event) nor\u000a      any direct key as to how it\u000a      will be enforced ([4] and[5]). While the Serious Fraud Office announced in\u000a      October 2012 that it has\u000a      stepped back from the use of civil penalties (http:\/\/www.sfo.gov.uk\/bribery--corruption\/corporate-\u000a        self-reporting.aspx), questions remain about the adequacy of its\u000a      resources in supporting\u000a      enforcement in the area of bribery and other economic crime.

The report she\u000a      was commissioned to\u000a      write for the Law Commission's consultation paper on corporate criminal\u000a      liability (published as\u000a      Appendix C) examines the different theoretical models underpinning\u000a      corporate criminal liability\u000a      ([2]). She notes &#8212; with agreement from the Law Commission itself &#8212; that\u000a      \"Somewhat paradoxically\u000a      it has been in statutory interpretation rather than in the development of\u000a      common law principles of\u000a      attribution, that the courts have been most responsive to the social and\u000a      economic context of\u000a      business operations ... the variety in corporate form, reach and activity\u000a      taken together with the\u000a      extensive range of criminal laws require a flexible response in terms of\u000a      corporate liability models\"\u000a      ([2]: Appendix C, para 100; CP, para 5.110).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40292","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    BEREC and its associated office are responsible for reviewing regulatory\u000a      decision-making on\u000a      telecoms markets across all 28 EU member states.

In summary, the research kick-started and directly\u000a      shaped the substantial\u000a      changes to BEREC and its office both now and in the future, and is the key\u000a      reference point.\u000a    Boeger has facilitated this impact through workshops. For example, on 8\u000a      October 2012, the\u000a      Commission held an open workshop in Brussels where Boeger presented the\u000a      report (alongside\u000a      some of the other authors) to members of industry and their representative\u000a      association, national\u000a      telecoms regulators and representatives of the BEREC Office, including its\u000a      Administrative Manager\u000a      (who commended the quality of Boeger and Corkin's analysis, [f]). Senior\u000a      representatives of\u000a      several national telecoms regulators also offered highly positive feedback\u000a      ([i], [j]). On 21 June\u000a      2013, Boeger co-organised a workshop attended by the key stakeholders in\u000a      telecommunciations\u000a      regulation &#8212; EU and national regulators themselves, MEPs, EU commission\u000a      members &#8212; at which\u000a      there was a further drive to progress and discuss the reforms.\u000a    Substantial Reform of BEREC and its Office\u000a      BEREC and the BEREC Office are committed to implementing Boeger and\u000a      Corkin's evaluation and\u000a      associated recommendations. BEREC had already initiated several actions to\u000a      improve aspects of\u000a      the Article 7\/7a procedure before the evaluation report was completed in\u000a      2012, but its published\u000a      work programme for 2013 commits it formally to consider the report's\u000a      recommendations in this\u000a      internal review, describing the two processes as `closely linked' ([d], p.\u000a      20). The Head of\u000a      International Policy, AGCOM, and Chair of the BEREC `Framework\u000a      implementation' working group,\u000a      responsible for overseeing the internal review, wrote ([i]):\u000a    The `BEREC Evaluation Report is certainly a very useful reference tool\u000a        that we are\u000a        considering, within the [working group], for our ongoing work of\u000a        reviewing the [BEREC rules\u000a        of procedure], as well as any other internal guidelines and working\u000a        methods (especially as\u000a        far as art.7-7a procedure is concerned)'.\u000a    The review is ongoing but BEREC has already implemented far-reaching\u000a      improvements. The\u000a      BEREC Office in particular has put in place (with further progress\u000a      ongoing) comprehensive\u000a      changes to its working methods under Article 7\/7a. Describing the\u000a      evaluation report as a `motivator'\u000a      in the process ([f]), the Administrative Manager of the BEREC Office\u000a      discussed the following\u000a      changes at the workshop organised by Boeger and Corkin on 21 June 2013:\u000a      Extending time limits\u000a      for national regulators to comment on BEREC draft opinions; Developing\u000a      templates for BEREC\u000a      opinions; Monitoring notifications of regulatory measures and potential\u000a      early-warning \"alerts\";\u000a      Maintaining a register of regulatory experts and rapporteurs; Regular\u000a      assessment reports about the\u000a      work of Article 7\/7a working groups; Committing national telecoms\u000a      regulators to give the Article\u000a      7\/7a procedure high priority; Clarification of definitions and detailed\u000a      procedure for BEREC and its\u000a      Office under Article 7\/7a (including the role of rapporteurs); Improving\u000a      language and translation\u000a      support; Facilitating cooperation and tripartite meetings.\u000a    Some of the recommendations have directly prompted calls to tackle the\u000a      shortcomings BEREC has\u000a      so far been unable to address. The Head of International Policy at Ofcom\u000a      and Chair of the BEREC\u000a      `Evaluation' offers perhaps the most comprehensive assessment of the\u000a      far-reaching significance of\u000a      Boeger and Corkin's research in both the intra-and inter-institutional\u000a      context ([j]):\u000a    `I think the Article 7\/7a case study in the BEREC evaluation report\u000a        will come to be seen as\u000a        a very important contribution to the (ongoing) debate over the\u000a        appropriate institutional\u000a        arrangements in Europe, in the telecoms sector. It was enormously useful\u000a        to have a\u000a        professional, independent and dispassionate account of how the Article\u000a        7\/7a process has\u000a        worked in its first 18 months (warts and all). On the one hand, it\u000a        offered welcome validation\u000a        and recognition of the real efforts that have been made by NRAs, BEREC\u000a        and the BEREC\u000a        Office, to make the system work. I expect this will spur our continued\u000a        commitment going\u000a        forward. On the other hand, the even-handed but frank (constructive)\u000a        criticism in the case\u000a        study should also serve to prevent any of the actors involved from\u000a        becoming complacent,\u000a        and the recommendations provide useful orientation on where and how we\u000a        should deploy\u000a        our resources.'\u000a    Dialogue shaping\u000a      The Commission is compelled to commission\/produce this evaluation report\u000a      pursuant to EU\u000a      legislation. It is designed specifically to frame directly the published\u000a      inter-institutional discussions,\u000a      consultations and negotiations between the Commission, the European\u000a      Parliament and the\u000a      Member States (including ministries and telecoms regulators) in preparing\u000a      the next review of the\u000a      EU telecoms framework (five EU Directives and one EU Regulation). In this\u000a      context, the document\u000a      co-produced by Boeger and Corkin has acted as the primary point of\u000a      reference for all their\u000a      subsequent communications on the subject in a number of crucial respects.\u000a    The European Parliament is compelled by law to respond publicly to the\u000a      Commission by\u000a      commenting on the report (a plenary vote is scheduled for 12 Dec 2013).\u000a      Therefore, their\u000a      recommendations directly shape this published inter-institutional dialogue\u000a      leading, eventually, to\u000a      the Commission's call-for-input for the next review (which is expected\u000a      sometime in 2014).\u000a      Exploiting their research fully as a platform to generate wider\u000a      inter-institutional exchanges, Boeger\u000a      and Corkin's stakeholder workshop brought together academic experts\u000a      alongside senior policy\u000a      players in the formal process, including from the European Parliament, the\u000a      Commission, national\u000a      telecoms regulators and senior industry representatives, to exchange views\u000a      on the institutional\u000a      arrangements discussed in their study. At the workshop, Mr Sed&#243; I Alabart\u000a      MEP, Rapporteur on\u000a      the Opinion dossier, remarked ([h]): `We have already analysed the\u000a        Evaluation.... In our first\u000a        reading of the Evaluation, we can agree on the major topics. ... [W]e\u000a        can use this Evaluation to\u000a        discuss the future of BEREC or a regulatory authority.'\u000a    Direct influence on EU Parliament draft report\u000a      The evaluation has directly and significantly influenced a simultaneous\u000a      parliamentary draft report\u000a      evaluating the implementation of the entire EU telecoms framework. This\u000a      report proposes that the\u000a      conclusions reached by the research of Boeger and Corkin be addressed in\u000a      the forthcoming\u000a      framework review ([e], p. 5, pt. 4 (x)). The evaluation ([k]):\u000a    `clearly helped us with [the draft] report.... It especially\u000a        allowed us to \"get to the point\" when\u000a        it came to raising difficulties related to the implementation of those\u000a        Telco Package's\u000a        provisions in which BEREC has a role, such as art 7\/7a procedures.'\u000a    Inter-institutional pressure\u000a      The EU Commission is using Boeger's co-produced report to exert some\u000a      inter-institutional\u000a      pressure on BEREC and the BEREC Office to follow the line advocated by the\u000a      researchers in their\u000a      report. The Commission's strategic positioning means that even greater\u000a      weight and visibility has\u000a      been given to the evaluation report. The Commission has directly\u000a      incorporated the report into its\u000a      `thinking process' in its recent and potentially far-reaching initiative\u000a      on completing the single market\u000a      in telecoms. Vice-President Kroes announced in Dec 2012 that she\u000a      considered the report as\u000a      `comprehensive and balanced.... a valuable input into our forthcoming\u000a        reflections on how to\u000a        deepen the internal market in this area.'

Their research\u000a      exposes the influence of national regulators in the creation of the\u000a      current European regulatory body\u000a      BEREC and its secretariat, the BEREC Office.

She also took the lead (80\/20) in organising\u000a      the project dissemination\u000a      workshop, bringing together senior policy-makers and academic experts, on\u000a      21 June 2013 in\u000a      London. Corkin contributed (50\/50) to an expansive literature review and\u000a      then concentrated on\u000a      seeking avenues to broaden out the theoretical research framework into\u000a      other sectors.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40293","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"933860","Name":"Botswana"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"366755","Name":"Sudan"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The HRIC provides an international focus for developing expertise, advice\u000a      and scholarship on the\u000a      role of national, regional and global institutions in the implementation\u000a      of human rights. The specific\u000a      impact of Murray and Evans' research can be seen clearly in the direct\u000a      impact on the work of the\u000a      African Commission (Strand A) and of the UN Office of the High\u000a      Commissioner for Human Rights\u000a      (OHCHR) (Strand B).\u000a    Strand A: Direct impact on the work of the African Commission\u000a      The research and resulting outputs [4], conducted under the AHRC award [6]\u000a      has directly impacted\u000a      on developments at the African Commission. The impact has been achieved\u000a      through reports on\u000a      events, production of policy papers and direct advice to key stakeholders\u000a      [a][b]. For example,\u000a      drawing upon their research in this area (in particular [1]-[4]) and\u000a      connections with key\u000a      stakeholders, in November 2011, the research team organised a high-level\u000a      seminar attended by\u000a      representatives from governments, the African Union, the African\u000a      Commission, UN treaty bodies\u000a      and civil society organisations. The event examined the way in which cases\u000a      decided by the African\u000a      Commission could be implemented domestically in the state concerned\u000a      because of a lack of\u000a      information about the outcomes (drawing on [1] and [3]). The event and\u000a      resulting report resulted in\u000a      national human rights institutions, such as Kenya [f], adapting their\u000a      strategy; and in a change of\u000a      policy by the African Commission itself, including the need to revisit its\u000a      Memoranda of\u000a      Understanding and engagement with other actors [d]. It also led to Amnesty\u000a      International working\u000a      with INTERIGHTS to promote effective implementation of the Commission's\u000a      decisions on\u000a      Botswana and Sudan, and the Commission is now following up on their\u000a      intervention. Amnesty also\u000a      took up Murray's advice to join an amicus brief in support of a request\u000a      (by a Nigerian NGO, Socio-\u000a      Economic Rights and Accountability Project) for an advisory opinion before\u000a      the Court [h].\u000a    Key recommendations from the research team's paper [4], originally\u000a      published as a policy paper,\u000a      on what role the African Commission's Committee on the Prevention of\u000a      Torture in Africa (CPTA)\u000a      should play with respect to implementation of the Robben Island Guidelines\u000a      (RIG) have been used\u000a      by the Commission and others to direct their further approach. In\u000a      particular, the principal\u000a      recommendation of that research concerning the development of guidance\u000a      notes and\/or authoritative\u000a      statements was picked up and replicated in the Commission's Johannesburg\u000a      Declaration. That\u000a      Declaration states that `The CPTA should issue authoritative comments\u000a        on specific provisions of the\u000a        RIG and provide legal guidance and interpretation to facilitate the\u000a        effective national implementation of\u000a        RIG by all stakeholders' - a direct echo of the HRIC's advice [c].\u000a      Until then, the CPTA had not adopted\u000a      authoritative guidance on the RIG. The Declaration is the first of its\u000a      sort and is now used by the\u000a      Commission and other actors to direct the work of the CPTA [c, h].\u000a    Strand B: Direct impact on UN OHCHR\u000a      A high-level event, held in September 2011 under the AHRC grant [6] and\u000a      informed by [5] (by that\u000a      stage accepted for publication), brought together members of UN human\u000a      rights treaty bodies,\u000a      representatives of the OHCHR and members of governments, NHRIs and NGOs to\u000a      discuss the\u000a      implementation of treaty body concluding observations. The report of this\u000a      event written by Murray\u000a      and drawing upon the research insights of Murray and Evans was fed into\u000a      the broader reform\u000a      agenda of the UN human rights system and is now cited directly on the\u000a      OHCHR website. Only a\u000a      few, select events have informed this agenda; only two citations on the UN\u000a      website are from\u000a      academic institutions as having been key in policy formation [a]. A number\u000a      of the recommendations\u000a      and conclusions were used in the resulting report from the UN High\u000a      Commissioner on Human\u000a      Rights [d]. Very unusually, this refers directly to the Bristol event. For\u000a      example, over the last few\u000a      years, there has been a proliferation in the number of recommendations\u000a      flowing from the\u000a      examination of state reports, which has made the reports problematic to\u000a      implement. The Bristol\u000a      event report recommended that there was a need to `reduce the number of\u000a        concluding\u000a        observations being produced' ([a], p.7), and this is then repeated\u000a      in the High Commissioner's\u000a      recommendation in her June 2012 report to `reduce the number of\u000a        recommendations made to\u000a        states parties in the concluding observations' ([d], p.55). The\u000a      process of treaty strengthening\u000a      reform is a highly political one, and as with many things at the UN, the\u000a      direct attribution of changes\u000a      in policy to particular actors, whether these be states, or academic\u000a      institutions, is unlikely. The\u000a      Report by the High Commissioner has been immensely significant,\u000a      determining the path and\u000a      content of future negotiations. At the level of the UN, it is unusual to\u000a      find research findings within a\u000a      report of this nature. The research recommendation supports the production\u000a      of focused, prioritised\u000a      and deliverable outcomes through the state reporting process. The\u000a      Commissioner's report has\u000a      been used by states, other UN bodies and regional organisations to direct\u000a      the process of\u000a      strengthening of the UN treaty bodies [d].\u000a    The impact of this event is further corroborated by the Director of the\u000a      Human Rights Treaty Division\u000a      at the OHCHR [f]. This notes that `my colleagues and I have benefitted\u000a        from these two days of rich\u000a        discussions among a group of different stakeholders....the ideas\u000a        generated during the meeting will\u000a        certainly contribute towards the many different proposals made to date'.\u000a      This personalised\u000a      recognition by a high-level member of the UN secretariat of the role of an\u000a      academic institution in\u000a      influencing discussions at the UN is (again) unusual. The terminology used\u000a      `will certainly\u000a      contribute' is evidence of more than mere engagement and that the event\u000a      has had an impact on\u000a      the policy of the UN. At a national level, the Foreign and Commonwealth\u000a      Office [i] have noted that\u000a      Evans' advice was \"invaluable\" on the UN treaty body consultations\u000a      and through the UK\u000a      consultations which helped inform the UK policy. Further, it was noted\u000a      that the advice Evans\u000a      \"...provided to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights' consultation\u000a        process was also\u000a        important in kick-starting serious discussion about how to support the\u000a        treaty body system\".\u000a    Subsequent to the adoption of this report, Evans, as vice-Chair (May\u000a      2013) and incoming Chair of\u000a      the Meeting of Chairs of Treaty Bodies (the influential body which steers\u000a      the direction of all UN\u000a      human rights treaty bodies), has played and will continue to play a\u000a      leading in taking forward this\u000a      agenda at the UN. Evans was elected to this role by fellow chairs,\u000a      enabling him to implement the\u000a      research recommendations further.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Through their research on the implementation of soft law in international\u000a      human rights, Evans and\u000a      Murray, directing Bristol's Human Rights Implementation Centre (HRIC),\u000a      have made significant\u000a      direct contributions to UN treaty body strengthening and the African\u000a      Commission on Human and\u000a      Peoples' Rights.

Professors Murray and Evans (who have held posts at Bristol since\u000a      2003 and 1988,\u000a      respectively), have provided supporting research and policy work to\u000a      facilitate the understanding of\u000a      these issues. Firstly, this has occurred at the level of the African\u000a      Commission on Human and\u000a      Peoples' Rights, and secondly at the level of the UN in terms of its\u000a      treaty body strengthening\u000a      process. Murray and Evans, in their individual capacities as well as\u000a      through leading a research\u000a      team under the HRIC (in this REF period: Steinerte, Long, Hallo de Wolf,\u000a      Mottershaw),have played\u000a      a key role in both these processes.\u000a    In an edited collection [1]-[3] and individual publications [4] [5], they\u000a      note that little scholarship has\u000a      been devoted to analysing the African Commission as an operational system\u000a      in practice. They\u000a      have filled that gap. Evans and Murray contributed three chapters to [1]\u000a      covering issues from state\u000a      reporting mechanisms [1], evidence and fact-finding by the Commission [2],\u000a      and the role of Special\u000a      Rapporteurs [3]. A further unique aspect to this collection is that it\u000a      included (in line with the HRIC's\u000a      approach) work of NGOs, advocates and members of the Commission itself.\u000a      The distinctive voice\u000a      of Evans\/Murray's chapters derives from their insistence that\u000a      implementation is a two-way process\u000a      between the Commission and states; that the operation of the Commission\u000a      sometimes does not\u000a      meet that basic aim (for example, regarding reporting mechanisms, they\u000a      note \"its principal function\u000a        appears to be as a device to encourage States' attendance at the\u000a        sessions\").\u000a    This and other publications also developed the distinctive argument that\u000a      national bodies have a\u000a      key role to play in bringing about compliance with international\u000a      standards, rather than simply feed\u000a      into international-level processes [5]. This research also showed that\u000a      this entails changes to how\u000a      the UN and regional treaty bodies themselves structured their own work.\u000a    In 2008-12, Murray and Evans were awarded an AHRC grant to examine the\u000a      implementation of\u000a      soft law through the African Commission's Robben Island Guidelines ([6]),\u000a      which enabled them to\u000a      build on this work through a mix of publications (eg [4][5]), events and\u000a      policy papers. This was a\u000a      pioneering project examining how effective state appointed monitors were\u000a      at a time when regimes\u000a      were themselves being accused of carrying out atrocities against their\u000a      citizens. The tracking of one\u000a      soft law document in a number of states, accompanied by the high profile\u000a      events involving key\u000a      stakeholders in the UN and Africa systems, provides a unique perspective\u000a      on the use and\u000a      implementation of treaty body decisions. As part of this research, the\u000a      team also produced a policy\u000a      paper ([4]) on what role the African Commission's Committee on the\u000a      Prevention of Torture in Africa\u000a      (CPTA) should play with respect to implementation of the Robben Island\u000a      Guidelines. Uniquely, this\u000a      paper and the subsequent article [4] suggested a strategy the Committee\u000a      could adopt regarding\u000a      monitoring the implementation of the Robben Island Guidelines.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40294","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1282028","Name":"Maldives"},{"GeoNamesId":"587116","Name":"Azerbaijan"},{"GeoNamesId":"174982","Name":"Armenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3437598","Name":"Paraguay"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3194884","Name":"Montenegro"},{"GeoNamesId":"1522867","Name":"Kazakhstan"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The AHRC project had a direct impact in changing how OPCAT was\u000a      implemented in the\u000a      international arena (by influencing the work of the SPT and the\u000a      development of the OPCAT\u000a      Contact Group, a coalition of key NGOs in the field of torture\u000a      prevention), in diverse domestic\u000a      arenas (including the UK government), and through the research team\u000a      providing comments on\u000a      draft and existing domestic legislation.

The research team\u000a      also have standing -\u000a      including being invited to attend and making formal statements &#8212; at the\u000a      SPT's sessions in Geneva.\u000a      The team provided the Subcommittee with briefings on states that it then\u000a      used as background\u000a      information for its visits to these countries. In its second annual report\u000a      [b] in 2009, the\u000a      Subcommittee stated: \"The SPT has remained in close contact with\u000a        Bristol University's OPCAT\u000a        Project and has exchanged ideas and views on a number of issues central\u000a        to the SPT's work. The\u000a        project team has been involved in organizing regional activities and has\u000a        provided a critical external\u000a        academic perspective concerning aspects of the SPT's work, for which the\u000a        SPT is very grateful\"\u000a      (para 59).\u000a    Secondly, during the AHRC-funded project [5], the researchers established\u000a      the \"OPCAT Contact\u000a      Group\", comprising relevant civil society organisations (such as the\u000a      Mental Disability Advocacy\u000a      Centre and Penal Reform International) and including the \"Bristol OPCAT\u000a      Group\" [b, Annex VI].\u000a      The Contact Group subsequently obtained standing before the SPT, which\u000a      generally operates in\u000a      private, underlining the privileged position of this group. This influence\u000a      has continued. So, for\u000a      example, in his statement to the 67th Session of the UN General\u000a      Assembly (2012), the SPT Chair\u000a      (by then, Evans) drew particular attention to the support of the OPCAT\u000a      Contact Group as one of\u000a      the key civil society bodies which had assisted in the \"quite\u000a        remarkable\" amount of change within\u000a      the first six years of OPCAT [d]. The research team has drawn on the\u000a      Contact Group's access to\u000a      the SPT to make recommendations on the Subcommittee's annual reports -\u000a      indeed, as a result of\u000a      one such intervention, the SPT amended the format of its annual reports in\u000a      line with the\u000a      researchers' recommendations [l] [c, para 1]. Even more importantly, the\u000a      SPT adopted the\u000a      research conclusions by changing the nature and structure of its visiting\u000a      programme to include\u000a      national preventive mechanism advisory visits (the first of which were\u000a      conducted in 2012) [e]. In its\u000a      fourth annual report in 2010 [c], the SPT noted that it had \"...continued\u000a        to benefit from the essential\u000a        support provided by civil society actors, both the OPCAT Contact Group\u000a        (present during the\u000a        Subcommittee's November session) and academic institutions (in\u000a        particular the Universities of\u000a        Bristol ...), both for the promotion of the Optional Protocol and its\u000a        ratification, and for\u000a        Subcommittee activities\" (para 39).\u000a    Thirdly, one of the researchers (Evans) was made a member of the\u000a      Subcommittee in 2009 and\u000a      was subsequently appointed as Chair in 2011. This appointment reflects the\u000a      visibility and influence\u000a      that the AHRC-funded research programme had obtained. By acting as its\u000a      Chair, the\u000a      recommendations of the research team have a direct and powerful influence\u000a      on the operation of\u000a      the SPT [d][e].\u000a    Domestic arena\u000a    The research team can point to direct impact on policy changes in a\u000a      number of contexts which can\u000a      be attributed directly to the events and activities they carried out\u000a      during the project. For example, at\u000a      the first Bristol OPCAT conference in April 2007 and subsequently in\u000a      November 2007 , the UK\u000a      government realised that its proposed NPM would not provide coverage for\u000a      police cells [k]. As a\u000a      direct result, after the conference, in 2008 and subsequently the remits\u000a      of the HM Inspectorate of\u000a      Prisons (HMIP) and HM Inspectorate of Constabulary were amended to ensure\u000a      they could visit\u000a      these particular places of detention [j], thereby increasing the UK's\u000a      compliance with its international\u000a      treaty obligations. The research team developed a close relationship with\u000a      HMIP and the UK NPM,\u000a      as illustrated by the adoption of a Memorandum of Understanding between\u000a      the research team and\u000a      the UK NPM in 2012. A seminar was co-hosted by the HRIC and the UK NPM in\u000a      December 2009.\u000a      One further concrete outcome of that seminar was that the UK NPM\u000a      recognised that its size and\u000a      complexity required that the mandates and methodologies of each of its\u000a      members should be\u000a      mapped, a task which the researchers themselves addressed [f]. The\u000a      regularly updated database\u000a      of the 18 members of the UK NPM is hosted by the University of Bristol but\u000a      linked from the NPM\u000a      and Ministry of Justice websites [g]. This has been used by the NPM\u000a      members and others and has\u000a      increased the visibility of the work of the NPM in the UK.\u000a    Development of Legislation\u000a    In addition, in this REF period, the research team have been asked, and\u000a      continue to receive\u000a      requests, for advice on draft and existing legislation on NPMs in a range\u000a      of countries (Maldives,\u000a      Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Paraguay, South\u000a      Africa, and Montenegro)\u000a      [for example, [i]-[k]]. In some cases, the research team saw and commented\u000a      on several drafts of\u000a      legislation which had a direct impact on the final legislative product.\u000a      Layla Duisekova, UN\u000a      Development Programme, wrote to the research team that: \"Your visit at\u000a        the end of January was a\u000a        turning point in the NPM law making process\". Ulugbek Asimov\u000a      (Kyrygystan) wrote to the\u000a      researchers as follows: \"I would like to congratulate also you on this\u000a        occasion. To a large extent\u000a        thanks to your involvement, your invaluable advice, recommendations,\u000a        letters of support it has\u000a        been possible to adopt this important piece of legislation\" [i].\u000a      Evans and Murray participated in a\u000a      confidential meeting to prepare Hungary for the operation of the NPM and\u000a      their contributions are\u000a      reflected in the recommendations from that meeting [j]. All of this advice\u000a      draws upon the research\u000a      described in section 3 above.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Bristol research into international, regional and national\u000a      mechanisms for preventing\u000a      torture is at the root of important changes in the operation and working\u000a      practices of the key bodies\u000a      involved.

The SPT, which comprises 25 independent\u000a      experts from various\u000a      regions of the world, provides guidance to states on the establishment of\u000a      NPMs and advises the\u000a      NPMs themselves. Members of the SPT and the NPMs visit places of\u000a      detention, from prisons to\u000a      mental health institutions, to check that those who are detained are not\u000a      suffering torture or cruelty.\u000a      The international human rights community has become increasingly\u000a      interested in the role of NPMs,\u000a      and their effectiveness has been questioned.\u000a    AHRC-funded research [5] [1] led by Professors Murray (appointed 2003)\u000a      and Evans (appointed\u000a      1988) of the University of Bristol Law School was the pioneering\u000a      study of OPCAT, and examined\u000a      the factors that determine the effectiveness of NPMs. It considered how\u000a      states should decide\u000a      which institutions to appoint as NPMs, how those institutions are likely\u000a      to operate, and how they\u000a      have started to interact with the SPT. Key to this project was the\u000a      innovative interaction between the\u000a      research team and the research participants, which included national\u000a      bodies and NGOs and\u000a      involved joint work packages at the UN and domestic levels.\u000a    The OUP monograph [1] was based on this research and the researchers'\u000a      comments on draft\u000a      legislation and other advice which had been given during the lifetime of\u000a      the AHRC project. It\u000a      identifies key factors that have shaped the operation of national visiting\u000a      bodies since OPCAT came\u000a      into force in 2006, including looking in detail at the background to the\u000a      adoption of the Protocol and\u000a      at how the SPT carried out its mandate in its first few years. It examines\u000a      the range of places of\u000a      detention that could be visited by these bodies, and the expectations\u000a      placed on the bodies\u000a      themselves. The book also locates OPCAT within the broader system of\u000a      torture prevention in the\u000a      UN and elsewhere and identifies a range of trends arising from the\u000a      different geographical regions.\u000a      Finally, the book is able to draw lessons for other new human rights\u000a      treaties such as the UN\u000a      Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention\u000a      on Enforced\u000a      Disappearances, which have similar provisions concerning national\u000a      mechanisms. This monograph\u000a      remains the only academic treatment of OPCAT and established the research\u000a      team as the leading\u000a      academics in the field.\u000a    Murray's article [2] gives further detail about the normative criteria\u000a      that should be considered when\u000a      establishing an NPM. This provided the framework for proposed draft\u000a      guidelines for such\u000a      mechanisms. The paper identifies the particular practical issues that\u000a      arise with regard to the\u000a      composition and operation of these institutions; in this sense, the piece\u000a      offers an insider's view of\u000a      the system. It therefore goes beyond a technical analysis of the legal\u000a      terms into the 'real life' of an\u000a      NPM. It remains the only scholarly work in this field. Evans [3] put\u000a      forward arguments for why the\u000a      SPT had to change the way in which it operated in the light of its\u000a      expansion to 25 members and 50\u000a      states' parties. The arguments flowed from the AHRC research and 20 years\u000a      of research in torture\u000a      prevention all conducted at Bristol University. The paper drew on work\u000a      Evans had previously\u000a      conducted collaboratively [4] into the European system for torture\u000a      prevention, which explored what\u000a      made those mechanisms most effective.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40295","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    There are 10,500 care proceedings annually concerning around 18,000\u000a      children in England and Wales.

Responses to problems identified in the research have\u000a      reduced this to 37 weeks, with a plan to complete proceedings within 26\u000a      weeks. The findings from the research have directly impacted in three\u000a      ways: on the Family Justice Review, as well as the design and\u000a      implementation of the 2013 reforms to care proceedings which will reduce\u000a      their cost and duration; through changes in local authority\u000a      pre-proceedings practice; and on the better collation of statistics\u000a      concerning care proceedings by court administrative staff.\u000a    Family Justice Review and the reform of care proceedings\u000a    The findings on the wide variations in case duration between courts [5]\u000a      and [2], the impact this has on costs [3], the role played by lawyers in\u000a      progressing cases and the barriers to effective judicial case management\u000a      [6] and [4] made it clear why previous attempts to reduce case duration\u000a      through directives to judges were ineffective. Rather, more substantial\u000a      changes were necessary so that judges were fully familiar with the cases\u000a      they were expected to manage. The President of the Family Division and the\u000a      Judicial College are undertaking work to improve case management on the\u000a      basis of this research (and within the context of longstanding and acute\u000a      concern about costs and delays in care proceedings: [a](i) and [f]).\u000a    Masson's research was used extensively in the Family Justice Review\u000a      Interim Report ([a](i)). For example, it relied on [5] and [2] for its\u000a      account of the excessive use of experts in care proceedings ([a](i): pp\u000a      109-110). Throughout the Family Justice Review Final Report, key messages\u000a      from the body of Masson's research provided the empirical basis for many\u000a      of the Review's recommendations to support case management (training,\u000a      judicial continuity and management of judges) and the need for engagement\u000a      with service users ([a](ii)). These reforms are being implemented;\u000a      legislation has been introduced to curtail the use of experts &#8212; the use of\u000a      experts and the length of proceedings are already reducing, for the\u000a      benefit of children who will have more timely decisions about their\u000a      future, local authorities and the tax payer. A subsequent Parliamentary\u000a      Select Committee, designed in part to provide democratic overview of the\u000a      proposals in the Interim Review, employed Masson as its specialist adviser\u000a      ([b]) and her research formed the underpinning for much of the discussion\u000a      in that report, providing, for example, corroboration of the anecdotal\u000a      views of judges and others who gave evidence to the committee ([b]: paras\u000a      247 &amp; 263).\u000a    Masson was invited to give a seminar to the civil servants supporting the\u000a      Family Justice Review team, to speak to the Review about care proceedings\u000a      and case management, asked to review draft proposals and research\u000a      undertaken for the Review. In addition to the specific references to the\u000a      research, the Review also referred to evidence given by Masson and others\u000a      which relied on the first two studies, including the Family Justice\u000a      Council and the Council of Circuit Judges. For example, findings from [6]\u000a      and [4] formed the basis both for the framing of issues of case management\u000a      ([a](ii): paras 3.54-7) and the recommendations (eg para 3.83; 3.96), as a\u000a      result of which Sir Nicholas Wall publicly announced the creation of a\u000a      Family Business Authority ([d]: para 20 [referring to Masson's research]\u000a      and accepting that, as Masson suggested, the fundamental problems are\u000a      cultural, para 30); Masson's Consultation Response highlighted the need\u000a      for better service user engagement by courts and the Review agreed with\u000a      Masson's important comment that better data and research could improve\u000a      public understanding of family justice ([a.](ii): para 2.105); Masson\u000a      shared the preliminary results from [1] with the review ([a](ii): para\u000a      3.108) and the Review recommended that their use should be revisited in\u000a      the light of Masson's research (para 3.110). Masson's research on legal\u000a      representation was cited by the President of the Family Division as `nailing\u000a        three particular canards about solicitors who undertake publicly funded\u000a        Children Act work' ([f]: para 42) and concerns highlighted by Masson\u000a      about the best practitioners leaving the field were accepted by the\u000a      Justice Select Committee ([g]: para 44).\u000a    Findings of [1] were first shared with The President of the Family\u000a      Division and Ryder J (who was responsible for the Family Justice\u000a      Modernisation Programme) in June 2012. Pre-proceedings work is given far\u000a      greater emphasis in the 2013 reforms. The President has identified local\u000a      authority pre-proceedings work as `vital', noting that `it can\u000a        divert a case along the route which avoids the need for care proceedings',\u000a      the evidence for this is Masson's research ([h]). All judges who hear care\u000a      proceedings have been provided with a summary of Masson's findings by the\u000a      Judicial College ([e]).\u000a    Changes to local authority pre-proceedings practice\u000a    The pre-proceedings research [1] identified the effectiveness of the\u000a      process for pre-birth planning, importance of close monitoring of cases in\u000a      pre-proceedings to avoid drift, and drawing the court's attention to the\u000a      work undertaken. Local authorities have made such changes as a result of\u000a      the research: this has been endorsed in a good practice guide for social\u000a      workers ([i]) and RiP, the organisation providing national training on the\u000a      care proceedings reforms has filmed a lecture by Masson and Dickens on\u000a      pre-proceedings work, for use in training social workers.\u000a    Judicial Statistics\u000a    The findings in the care profiling study [5] and [2] that Final Hearings\u000a      were routinely booked at the start of cases for 3 or 5 days, but were\u000a      frequently much shorter, led to new instructions to courts in the \"Public\u000a      Law Outline\" (a court Practice Direction) in April 2008 about listing\u000a      final hearings. There was evidence that later listing did unblock court\u000a      time tables ([j]). The identification during the fieldwork of wide scale\u000a      mis-entry of cases into the county court database, which is used for the Judicial\u000a        Statistics, led to a review and a change of method to reduce the\u000a      problem of double counting ([c]). The published statistics are now more\u000a      reliable ([b]).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Masson's three linked studies of the operation of child protection\u000a      proceedings led to changes in the ways in which the courts handle the\u000a      10,500 care proceedings annually concerning around 18,000 children in\u000a      England and Wales. The findings from the research have directly impacted\u000a      in three ways: on the Family Justice Review as well as the design and\u000a      implementation of the 2013 reforms to care proceedings to reduce their\u000a      cost and duration; through changes in local authority pre-proceedings\u000a      practice; and on the better collation of statistics concerning care\u000a      proceedings by court administrative staff.

The research draws on Masson's\u000a      lengthy engagement in care proceedings, brought by local authorities under\u000a      the Children Act 1989, section 31 to protect children. These proceedings\u000a      have been a focus for government concern because of their length (which\u000a      impacts adversely on children's welfare) and their cost to the public\u000a      purse for legal aid, the courts and local authority children's services.\u000a    The research, conducted (2006-2010) with Julia Pearce (a senior research\u000a      fellow at the University of Bristol Law School, who left in May 2010) and\u000a      (2010-2012) with Dr Jonathan Dickens (Co I) Senior Lecturer in Social Work\u000a      at UEA), offers three linked studies of care proceedings.\u000a    \"The care profiling study\" [1] was funded by the Ministry of\u000a      Justice and conducted from November 2006 to May 2007 [5]. It was designed\u000a      to find baseline data against which reforms could be evaluated. It was a\u000a      quantitative study of 386 cases from 10 Court Areas, using court files to\u000a      derive a profile of each case in terms of the children and families\u000a      involved; local authority and other agency activity; the court processes;\u000a      and the outcome of the proceedings. It identified causes of delay and poor\u000a      use of court resources. A further element of the analysis used costs data\u000a      from the Legal Services Commission allowing the handling of cases to be\u000a      linked to case costs. This showed that costs rose with duration [3]. It\u000a      identified major flaws in the ways court recorded transfers to county\u000a      courts This resulted in double counting of some cases and inflation in the\u000a      numbers of these recorded in the Judicial Statistics. It also\u000a      showed substantial differences in the way different courts managed these\u000a      cases, in terms of transfer to higher courts, listing arrangements,\u000a      directions for use of experts, the number of hearings and case duration\u000a      [2].\u000a    \"The parents' representation study\" [2] was funded by the ESRC and\u000a      conducted from July 2008 to January 2010. It used ethnographic methods to\u000a      study the legal representation of parents in care proceedings. This added\u000a      depth to the earlier file-based study. It involved observing 109 court\u000a      hearings as well as the discussions between the parties and their legal\u000a      representatives, including 16 case studies followed to final hearing, and\u000a      61 interviews with lawyers\/ judges. It was undertaken in four court areas,\u000a      including two used in [6]. It provided a rich account of the work done by\u000a      lawyers representing very disadvantaged parents whose children are the\u000a      subject of these cases. It revealed how the course of care proceedings\u000a      continued to be determined by the parties' lawyers, rather than being case\u000a      managed by the judge as court rules and practice directions require,\u000a      providing evidence of, and reasons, for the failure of the care\u000a      proceedings reforms introduced in 2008 [4]. It identified a lack of\u000a      continuity in professional involvement (lawyers, social workers,\u000a      magistrates' legal advisers and judges) as impeding management and timely\u000a      decision making. It explained how decisions are reached, why experts were\u000a      appointed so frequently, and why legally weak cases involve (costly)\u000a      contested hearings.\u000a    \"The pre-proceedings study\" [3] funded by the ESRC and conducted\u000a      between April 2010 and June 2012 [1]. It used mixed methods to examine how\u000a      local authorities operated, and families and courts responded to, a\u000a      process introduced in 2008 with the aim of diverting cases from the courts\u000a      and reducing the duration of those that did go to court. It established\u000a      that the pre-proceedings process was effective in diverting almost a\u000a      quarter of cases from care proceedings but showed that a lack of provision\u000a      for monitoring cases resulted in substantial delays in taking some cases\u000a      to court. Also, judicial disregard for local authority pre-court work\u000a      meant that court proceedings for these cases were no quicker.\u000a    Together the studies provide a rich picture of the operation of care\u000a      proceedings, which helps to explain why they take so long and cost so much\u000a      to the public purse. They provide a picture, previously unavailable to\u000a      policy makers and practitioners, about what care proceedings were really\u000a      like, both in terms of the most common factors which resulted in court\u000a      applications and how cases were handled in the courts. They highlight that\u000a      (contrary to the impression held by the Judiciary and presented by the Law\u000a      Reports) the majority of cases concerned child neglect and involved\u000a      families who had been known to local authorities for a substantial time.\u000a      They made clear that reforming care proceedings was not simply a matter of\u000a      introducing new procedures but that changes in court culture and practice,\u000a      and in the court's response to local authority evidence, were required.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40403","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described in section 2 has produced impact in three major\u000a      ways. First, it has informed legislative debate, thereby influencing\u000a      legislative change, at EU level. Second, it has shaped executive policy\u000a      (specifically UK prosecutorial policy) at the national level. Third, it\u000a      has been used to inform law enforcement agents involved in the detection\u000a      and prosecution of cyberstalking.\u000a    (a) Informing the legislative debate at EU level\u000a    [3.1] was sent by the authors to all MEPs, the national Ministers\u000a      comprising the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and the Commission. With\u000a      regard to the debate in the European Parliament, [3.1] and a covering\u000a      letter were sent to MEPs in August 2012, in advance of the Parliamentary\u000a      debate on the issue, which took place in mid-September 2012. Several MEPs\u000a      confirmed that the article assisted them in their consideration of what\u000a      was an important and complicated piece of legislation. Those who responded\u000a      include, notably, a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice\u000a      and Home Affairs (one of the parliamentary committees which reported on\u000a      the draft) [5.1], the Vice President of the Parliament [5.2], who chaired\u000a      the debate on the Directive on 11 September 2012, and the President of the\u000a      Parliament [5.4]. In terms of the actual amendments to the text of the\u000a      draft Directive called for in [3.1], the call made in the article for the\u000a      proposed Directive to be rejected in its then-present form was heeded, and\u000a      the final text was in fact significantly transformed from its original\u000a      version. Although the call for a direct reference to cyberstalking in the\u000a      recitals and\/or body of the Directive was not, in the event, adopted, a\u000a      material error in the draft which had been pointed out in [3.1] was\u000a      rectified in the post-debate version which was sent to the Council, dated\u000a      20 September 2012 (compare the original proposal for the Directive, 18 May\u000a      2011, at eur-lex.europa.eu\/LexUriServ\/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0275:FIN:EN:PDF\u000a      with the final version of Directive 2012\/29\/EU, 20 September 2012, at\u000a      register.consilium.europa.eu\/pdf\/en\/12\/pe00\/pe00037.en12.pdf).\u000a    The research has contributed to an important debate on a vital piece of\u000a      legislation which will ensure that the victims of crime are in the future\u000a      afforded the same minimum protections in all EU countries. As a result,\u000a      the research has helped enhance the rights of, and mitigate harm to,\u000a      individuals, as well as improving access to justice.\u000a    (b) Influencing prosecutorial policies in the United Kingdom\u000a    In March 2013, Lang and Maple submitted a response [5.5] to the Crown\u000a      Prosecution Service (CPS) public consultation on the \"Interim Guidelines\u000a      on prosecuting cases involving communications sent via Social Media\",\u000a      issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in December 2012\u000a      (see: www.cps.gov.uk\/consultations\/social_media_consultation.pdf).\u000a      Lang and Maple's response to the consultation included a copy of [3.1].\u000a      The main argument made in the response was that the guidelines needed to\u000a      be much more victim-focussed, and that concentrating only on the reach of\u000a      social media posts (as the interim guidelines did) seemed to damn those\u000a      who criticised public figures, whilst exonerating cyberstalkers the reach\u000a      of whose posts could be very local indeed, but the vulnerability of whose\u000a      targets could be far greater. Accordingly, the response argued that\u000a      vulnerability of the \"target\" of the allegedly criminal communication\u000a      should be an additional public interest factor to be taken into account by\u000a      the CPS in making its decision as to whether or not to prosecute the\u000a      sender.\u000a    At the end of the public consultation period, the guidelines were\u000a      reviewed by the DPP and the CPS' Strategy and Policy Directorate in light\u000a      of the responses received, and final guidelines were published in June\u000a      2013 (see Director of Public Prosecutions, \"Guidelines on prosecuting\u000a      cases involving communications sent via social media\", 20 June 2013,\u000a      available at www.cps.gov.uk\/consultations\/social_media_guidelines.pdf).\u000a    Lang and Maple's response to the consultation called for `vulnerability\u000a      of the victim' to be expressly mentioned as an additional public interest\u000a      factor to be taken into account in considering whether to prosecute; this\u000a      call has been heeded. It is specifically mentioned in the summary of\u000a      responses [5.6, p.8], and led to a cross-reference being inserted into the\u000a      text, directing prosecutors to section 4.12(c) of the Code for Crown\u000a      Prosecutors which deals with vulnerability of the victim (compare Guidelines,\u000a      p.12, &#167;42 and Interim Guidelines, p.11, &#167;37). Lang and Maple's\u000a      response to the consultation (including the description of the special\u000a      vulnerability of cyberstalking victims in [3.1]) thus led directly to the\u000a      decision to make reference to the concept of victim vulnerability in the\u000a      final Guidelines. As a consequence, this concept should be at the\u000a      forefront of prosecutors' minds when deciding whether or not to bring\u000a      charges against those accused of crimes committed via social media,\u000a      including cyberstalking.\u000a    Lang and Maple's research has thus enhanced the manner in which the CPS\u000a      assesses whether to prosecute wrongdoers in the case of offences involving\u000a      the use of social media. It thus has positively affected the vital service\u000a      which the CPS performs for the public. In addition, the research has\u000a      influenced professional guidelines and affected professional practice, as\u000a      well as helping mitigate harm to individuals, not only by making\u000a      prosecution of those who perpetrate crime on vulnerable victims by means\u000a      of social media more likely, but also by disincentivising potential\u000a      perpetrators in the first place. The protection of the rights of\u000a      vulnerable victims, and potential vulnerable victims, which was\u000a      specifically advocated in the research, has thus been enhanced.\u000a    (c) Informing law enforcement agencies\u000a    On 18 April 2013, at the National Stalking Awareness Day Conference in\u000a      London, Lang and Maple presented [3.1] to the Stalking and Harassment Lead\u000a      for the UK Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), who was extremely\u000a      interested in the research and subsequently commissioned Lang and Maple to\u000a      prepare a provision-by-provision summary of the new EU Directive on\u000a      victims' rights, to be distributed to the Chief Police Officers of all\u000a      police forces in the country [5.8].\u000a    The impact of Lang and Maple's research on the activities of the ACPO,\u000a      beginning with the meeting in April 2013, has thus been considerable, and\u000a      has had a knock-on impact on the situation of victims of crime throughout\u000a      the UK. Every Chief Police Officer in the country is in possession of the\u000a      summary of the new Directive, which is being distributed among their\u000a      staff. As a consequence, police officers, in their day-to-day dealings\u000a      with the victims of crime, will ensure that victims receive all of the new\u000a      rights which the Directive contains. As a result, those who are the\u000a      victims of crime in the UK are likely de facto to enjoy the\u000a      benefits of the extra rights and protection which the Directive affords\u000a      them, some two years earlier than might otherwise have been the case.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes how research on the rights of victims of\u000a      cyberstalking conducted by a CRiL researcher in collaboration with\u000a      researchers from other disciplines has:\u000a    (a) informed the views of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in\u000a      the context of the adoption by the European Parliament of a new directive\u000a      establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of\u000a      victims of crime;\u000a    (b) influenced the formulation of new prosecutorial policies by the UK\u000a      Crown Prosecution Service in relation to crimes committed through social\u000a      media; and\u000a    (c) made information available to law enforcement agencies within the UK\u000a      involved in the repression of cybercrimes.\u000a    Through its impact on the adoption of new EU legislation and UK\u000a      prosecutorial policies, and by providing relevant information to UK law\u000a      enforcement officials, the research has had a positive impact on the\u000a      protection of individuals &#8212; including in particular the most vulnerable -\u000a      from cyberstalking, both at the national and European level.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Bedfordshire\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bedfordshire (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bedfordshire","PeerGroup":"E","Region":"East","UKPRN":10007152}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1 C.

The starting point of\u000a      the research is recognition of the need for enhanced legal protection of\u000a      the victims of cyberstalking, who are particularly vulnerable due to the\u000a      crime's terrifying combination of the anonymity and ubiquity of the\u000a      perpetrators and the ongoing psychological and physical risks which its\u000a      victims generally face (`repeat victimisation').\u000a    One of the main outputs presenting the findings of the research [3.1] was\u000a      published in August 2012, with the express intent of informing the\u000a      political debate at EU level at a time when a new EU directive\u000a      establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of\u000a      victims of crime was being discussed. The Directive in question (Directive\u000a      2012\/29\/EU) was adopted by the European Parliament on 12 September 2012\u000a      and by the Council of Ministers on 4 October 2012.\u000a    In [3.1], Lang and Maple argue that the EU has special responsibility\u000a      where cyberstalking is concerned due to the crime's significant\u000a      cross-border dimension, both in terms of the location of victims and\u000a      perpetrators and in terms of the location of intermediaries without whom\u000a      the crime could not be committed (including, e.g., Internet Service\u000a      Providers). The authors argued that the Directive on victims' rights,\u000a      which at that point only existed in the form of a Commission proposal (COM\u000a      (2011) 275), should expressly include the offence of cyberstalking in the\u000a      list of crimes the victims of which are `particularly vulnerable', and\u000a      criticised the Commission's proposal for failing to make a specific\u000a      reference to a crime of major potential cross-border significance.\u000a      According to the authors, the inclusion of victims of cyberstalking on the\u000a      list of vulnerable victims in the proposed directive would have tangible\u000a      benefits for victims throughout Europe. The research highlighted that the\u000a      Council of Ministers, which at that point was negotiating a `first reading\u000a      agreement' with MEPs, intended to shy away from an explicit list\u000a      altogether, thus returning responsibility for the definition of\u000a      `vulnerability' back to Member States. The authors argued that such a move\u000a      risked undermining the whole purpose of the exercise, which was to allow\u000a      victims to be treated in the same way no matter in which country they (and\u000a      the perpetrator) were located. It was further argued that omission of the\u000a      crime of cyberstalking from the list (or the absence of any list) would\u000a      have devastating consequences not only for the victims, but for the single\u000a      market itself.\u000a    This last point was developed in [3.2], which analysed the Directive as\u000a      adopted. Ultimately, the EU legislature decided not to include a list of\u000a      vulnerable victims and instead to set out the factors which police and\u000a      victim support services were to use when carrying out their `individual\u000a      assessment' of the particular victim. In [3.2], that choice is considered\u000a      from a number of angles, including whether it constitutes an instance of\u000a      `minimum harmonisation', and, if so, whether that doctrine, originating in\u000a      the effort to complete the Internal Market by 1992, could be applied to\u000a      the vulnerable victims of serious crimes.\u000a    [3.3] draws together the various strands of the earlier research,\u000a      updating the provision-by-provision analysis of the Directive from [3.1]\u000a      to reflect the post-adoption situation. Further, expanding on the argument\u000a      in [3.2], it reiterates the position that the approach finally taken by\u000a      the EU's legislature, in establishing an `individual assessment' of the\u000a      vulnerability of each victim, in lieu of a per se list, was the\u000a      wrong one.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40404","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described in section 2 has had a clear impact outside\u000a      academia, in particular in the following areas:\u000a    (a) Assisting NGOs in shaping their strategies (including litigation\u000a        strategies)\u000a    Dr Borelli's research on human rights and counter-terrorism has both\u000a      grown out of and fed into her long-standing collaboration with NGOs\u000a      specialising in the international legal protection of human rights.\u000a    Through her consultancy work, Borelli's research has had an impact on\u000a        the legal arguments put forward by human rights NGOs involved in human\u000a        rights litigation. For instance, the knowledge and expertise\u000a      acquired through research on prosecution of abuses committed during states\u000a      of exception was put to practical use through contribution to and\u000a      assistance in the drafting of an amicus curiae brief, submitted by\u000a      members of the Lawyers Advisory Committee of the NGO Peace Brigades\u000a      International UK to the Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia [5.7]. The\u000a      case arises out of the 2005 massacre of residents of the San Jos&#233; de\u000a      Apartado Peace Community by members of a paramilitary group, operating in\u000a      conjunction with the Colombian Army. The case, which concerns the criminal\u000a      responsibility of senior members of the Colombian armed forces for their\u000a      role in the massacre, is, as of October 2013, pending before the Supreme\u000a      Court of Justice.\u000a    Borelli's research has also contributed in a significant way to the shaping\u000a        of advocacy policies of human rights NGOs. For instance, in April\u000a      2011, in light of her expertise in the field of human rights and national\u000a      security, Borelli was commissioned by REDRESS to prepare [3.2]. A longer\u000a      version of the report, including the background research carried out in\u000a      order to identify problematic areas, has been made available to Redress\u000a      for internal use with a view to assisting the organisation itself more\u000a      generally to identify strategic areas for litigation and advocacy\u000a      activities. The Report, which contains a detailed analysis of the\u000a      international legal standards of protection against torture and\u000a      ill-treatment, has also been used by Redress as background material in\u000a      preparing training and discussion materials for meeting with governmental\u000a      experts and human rights activists [5.3]. Finally, Borelli's research has\u000a      also influenced public debate and informed relevant non-academic users.\u000a      A good example of this is again [3.2]. First, it has assisted the\u000a      organisation which commissioned it in identifying strategic areas for its\u000a      action; in that regard, a senior officer of REDRESS noted that the\u000a      research had \"informed, and helped to shape REDRESS's advocacy on the\u000a      issue of security legislation, which constitutes a critical development as\u000a      it facilitates\/perpetuates torture and frequently poses considerable\u000a      obstacles to accountability and reparation\". Second, the report, which has\u000a      also been translated into French, Spanish and Arabic, has been widely\u000a      distributed to and used by other human rights NGOs, including being\u000a      reproduced on their websites as reference material. For instance, Dignity,\u000a      a Danish human rights NGO with a similar mandate to that of REDRESS,\u000a      included the report in the \"toolkit\" of materials for practitioners and\u000a      human rights activists available on their website [5.4], whilst the\u000a      Spanish NGO RIS (Rights International Spain), an independent\u000a      non-governmental organisation whose stated mission is \"to strengthen human\u000a      rights accountability in Spain, focusing on access to justice for victims\u000a      of human rights violations\", has included it on the webpage dedicated to\u000a      international reference materials on \"Security and Human Rights\" [5.5].\u000a    (b) Informing the debate within international organisations\u000a    Due to its nature and subject-matter, Borelli's research on\u000a      counter-terrorism has had an impact on the public and institutional\u000a        debate on counter-terrorism and influenced the work of international\u000a      human rights monitoring bodies. A prime example of this type of impact is\u000a      that deriving from the REDRESS Report [3.2]. As mentioned above, the\u000a      Report was prepared in the context of a project funded by the European\u000a      Commission and was prepared with the express intention to inform and\u000a      influence domestic policy-makers and human rights institutions in a broad\u000a      range of States, as well as to contribute to the debate on human rights\u000a      and national security in relevant international fora, including the\u000a      European Union and the United Nations. The Report was submitted to the\u000a      European Commission and is highlighted by the Division on Human Rights and\u000a      Democracy of the Commission as one of its key references on torture from\u000a      EU-funded projects and partner organisations [5.2]. The Report has also\u000a      been circulated by REDRESS to members of various UN Human Rights bodies,\u000a      including the Human Rights Council and the UN Committee Against Torture.\u000a      The very fact of the publication of the report and its distribution by a\u000a      leading NGO with a long history of cooperation with international human\u000a      rights monitoring bodies ensures that the report is considered, given due\u000a      weight and informs the debate within those bodies. Further evidence of the\u000a      impact of the report on the international debate on the topic emerges from\u000a      the fact that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\u000a      Refugees (UNOHCR) posted the report on its public website [5.6]; the\u000a      website in question is a key point of reference for practitioners, policy\u000a      makers and experts working on human rights issues.\u000a    (c) Contributing to the public debate on counter-terrorism and human\u000a        rights\u000a    Borelli's research on human rights and counter-terrorism has informed\u000a      public debate on the controversial question of the protection of the\u000a      fundamental rights of terrorist suspects. An example of this type of\u000a      impact is that deriving from the research on rendition and intelligence\u000a      cooperation [3.1], carried out as part of a project on intelligence\u000a      accountability jointly undertaken by DCAF, the Human Rights Centre at the\u000a      University of Durham and the Intelligence Oversight Committee of the\u000a      Norwegian Parliament. The project brought together intelligence\u000a      practitioners and civil servants, members of oversight bodies,\u000a      representatives of civil society organisations and academics to discuss\u000a      new trends in international intelligence cooperation, examine the\u000a      challenges faced by intelligence oversight bodies and make recommendations\u000a      as to how oversight of international intelligence cooperation may be\u000a      strengthened. The research was presented to the Intelligence Oversight\u000a      Committee of the Norwegian Parliament, thereby contributing to informed\u000a      discussion in that forum. As noted above, [3.2] has also influenced public\u000a      debate on counter-terrorism measures.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study focuses on the impact on the legal and policy debate at\u000a      the domestic and international level of research carried out within the\u000a      Centre for Research in Law (CRiL) on the legal protection of fundamental\u000a      rights in situations of exception.\u000a    In particular, it discusses how the research in question has:\u000a    (a) assisted NGOs in shaping their strategies;\u000a    (b) informed the debate within international organisations;\u000a    (c) contributed to raising public awareness of issues relating to respect\u000a      for fundamental rights in the context of counter-terrorism.\u000a    By raising awareness of the relevant legal constraints upon States and by\u000a      assisting NGOs and international organizations, the research has\u000a      contributed to reinforcing the protection of the fundamental rights of\u000a      individuals belonging to specific groups and, more broadly, to the\u000a      strengthening of the rule of law at both the domestic and international\u000a      level.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Bedfordshire\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bedfordshire (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bedfordshire","PeerGroup":"E","Region":"East","UKPRN":10007152}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1 S.

Some aspects of the research build on\u000a      work previously carried out by Borelli at the Catholic University of Milan\u000a      (2002-03) and University College London (2005-10).\u000a    The research focuses on the application of international human rights\u000a      standards in situations of exception, and particularly in the context of\u000a      counter-terrorism, national emergencies and military activities. Within\u000a      that broader area of research, three principal strands can be identified:\u000a    1) The protection of human rights in the context of counter-terrorism.\u000a    This strand of the research focuses on the way in which certain policies and\u000a    measures adopted in the name of counter-terrorism in the years since 9\/11\u000a    have jeopardised basic principles of the rule of law and infringed the\u000a    fundamental rights of individuals. Such measures include the indefinite\u000a    detention of terrorist suspects; the practice of so-called extraordinary\u000a    rendition; and the use of evidence obtained by torture. Borelli, who has\u000a    acted as a consultant to civil society organisations involved in relevant\u000a    litigation in this regard (both domestically and at the international\u000a    level), has written a number of internationally recognised pieces on these\u000a    issues and has presented extensively on this topic; her most recent\u000a    publication in this area analyses the phenomenon of \"extraordinary\u000a    renditions\" of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism [3.3].\u000a    2) The transversal question of the relationship between national\u000a        security and the protection of fundamental rights. The research\u000a      analyses international and domestic legal instruments and the practice of\u000a      states and international monitoring bodies, and demonstrates that the\u000a      protection of national security and effective respect for the fundamental\u000a      rights of all individuals are not, nor should they be, mutually exclusive.\u000a      Borelli argues that the current international legal framework for the\u000a      protection of human rights is sufficiently flexible and allows states to\u000a      counter threats to national security whilst at the same time respecting\u000a      individual human rights. The research explores the role of various actors\u000a      in upholding the correct balance between national security considerations\u000a      and effective human rights protection; in particular, it critically\u000a      examines the role of national security services and the limitations which\u000a      should be imposed on their freedom of action. One output of that research\u000a      was published in 2011 in the context of a project sponsored by the\u000a      Intelligence Oversight Committee of the Norwegian Parliament [3.1]. The\u000a      impact of \"security legislation\" (i.e. laws enacted in order to counter a\u000a      &#8212; real or perceived &#8212; threat to national security) on the implementation\u000a      of the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment is analysed in\u000a      [3.2], a research report commissioned by REDRESS, a non-governmental\u000a      organisation specialising in the protection of victims of torture around\u000a      the world. [3.2], co-authored by Borelli and a staff lawyer at REDRESS,\u000a      surveys and critically analyses a broad range of \"security laws\" adopted\u000a      by states in the years since the events of 9\/11 and highlights problematic\u000a      issues which arise from such laws and\/or their implementation in practice.\u000a      The report concludes by identifying best practices and presenting\u000a      recommendations addressed to policy makers, judges and civil society\u000a      organisations, as well as a range of actors operating at the international\u000a      level.\u000a    3) The investigation and prosecution of large scale human rights\u000a        violations committed during situations of exception. Borelli was\u000a      involved in the DOMAC project (www.domac.is),\u000a      a major international collaborative research project which studied the\u000a      domestic prosecution of mass atrocities from a variety of angles. In that\u000a      regard, she was responsible for the work packages examining the impact of\u000a      the case law of the European and the Inter-American Courts of Human Rights\u000a      upon the capacity of States to undertake effective investigation and\u000a      prosecution of large scale abuses carried out within their territory in\u000a      the context of civil war, military occupation, and large scale\u000a      counter-terrorism operations. [3.4], based on that research, was published\u000a      in 2013 as part of the final output of the project.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40568","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The various strands of the underpinning research had an impact on a wide\u000a      range of actors: the UN,\u000a      the OECD and TI &#8212; UK.

The questionnaire\u000a      content and design of the surveys conducted impacted on questionnaire\u000a      design and analysis for\u000a      three projects conducted by TI-UK during 2010 - 2011. Carr took part from\u000a      the design to the\u000a      analysis stages in the three projects. The first project was a survey of\u000a      Bribery in the UK, the\u000a      second was National Integrity Survey. These surveys are published as\u000a      Corruption in UK Part One\u000a      National Opinion Survey (see (f) in section 5) and Corruption in the UK\u000a      Part Two &#8212; Assessment of\u000a      Key Sectors (see (g) in section 5) and Corruption in the UK Part Three &#8212;\u000a      National Integrity Survey.\u000a      The National Integrity Report was referenced in the new national strategy\u000a      on organised crime and\u000a      was discussed both in the House of Lords and the Welsh Assembly (see (h)\u000a      section 5).\u000a    TI's third project on Defence Companies Anti-Corruption Strategy resulted\u000a      in the first ever\u000a      Government Defence Anti-Corruption Index (see (i) in section 5). According\u000a      to TI's Programme\u000a      Director \"[Professor Indira Carr's] feedback was of high importance in\u000a      helping set the parameters\u000a      for the research for both indices, and in ensuring the resulting outputs\u000a      were clear and avoided\u000a      value-laden analysis. Her advice also stressed the need for conceptual\u000a      clarity between the indices,\u000a      and pointed out that potential outputs might be able to bridge the two\u000a      pieces of work: an angle TI-DSP\u000a      is currently considering in greater depth.

According to the World\u000a      Economic Forum and the\u000a      World Bank the cost of corruption equals more than 5% of global GDP (US $\u000a      2.6 trillion) with US\u000a      $1 trillion paid as bribes every year. A critical understanding of the\u000a      current international anti-corruption\u000a      strategies is therefore essential to combating corruption effectively,\u000a      thus enabling\u000a      poverty reduction, one of the Millennium Development Goals.\u000a    The Research\u000a    No detailed study examining the panoply of anti-corruption strategies and\u000a      their impact on the\u000a      different stakeholders (companies, civil society organisations, public\u000a      administration) had been\u000a      undertaken till this case study. This research therefore analysed closely\u000a      (1) the many regional and\u000a      international anti-corruption conventions and soft law instruments,\u000a      identifying the gaps in order to\u000a      recommend improvements, and (2) the impact of these strategies on company\u000a      attitudes, (3) the\u000a      improvements to public administration systems, and (4) the emerging\u000a      practices and relationships\u000a      between companies and CSOs (Civil Society Organisations). Empirical\u000a      surveys of companies,\u000a      CSOs\/NGOs (Non Governmental Organisations) were an integral part of this\u000a      research. The two\u000a      anti-corruption instruments that have made a huge impact globally are the\u000a      OECD Convention on\u000a      Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions\u000a      1997 (OECD Convention)\u000a      and the United Nations Convention against Corruption 2003 (UNCAC) and\u000a      these formed the\u000a      backbone of the analysis. Analysis of the above instruments and others\u000a      formulated, for instance,\u000a      by the African Union exposed many weaknesses (e.g. lack of whistleblower\u000a      protection, integrity\u000a      mechanisms within public administration), vagueness of terminology (e.g.\u000a      bribe vs facilitation\u000a      payments) and failure by states to implement or enforce using ambiguous\u000a      provisions (e.g. Art 5\u000a      OECD Convention). During the course of the research, the findings were fed\u000a      to the international\u000a      institutions that drafted these instruments.\u000a    The Surrey researchers were of the view that if a change could be\u000a      instituted in the OECD's\u000a      approach to the distinction between facilitation payments and bribes it\u000a      would ensure that\u000a      businesses did not pass off bribes as facilitation payments and so avoid\u000a      penalties. This change\u000a      towards facilitation payments would reduce the incidence of corruption,\u000a      the reasons being (1) the\u000a      ratification of the OECD Convention by developed economies (34 member\u000a      states) and emerging\u000a      economies such as Brazil, South Africa and Russia; and (2) active\u000a      enforcement in many countries\u000a      due to the peer review mechanism it operates. By way of illustration of\u000a      the effectiveness of the\u000a      OECD Convention and peer review, the UK with a 3.6% share of world GDP has\u000a      had 23 cases\u000a      (e.g. Macmillan Publishing, Mabey Johnson) and 49 investigations since its\u000a      implementation.\u000a    Change in the attitudes towards public administration by adopting\u000a      mechanisms that raise the\u000a      integrity of public officials is another feature that is promoted in the\u000a      UNCAC and reflected in the\u000a      policies adopted by donor organisations. As part of aid, states are\u000a      required to improve public\u000a      administration. The Surrey research found that these processes have been\u000a      largely unsuccessful\u000a      despite close engagement by donor agencies and substantial funding given\u000a      for improvements and\u000a      training. Using post-colonial literature as a backdrop, the study\u000a      identified the lack of ownership of\u000a      the instituted changes on the part of the donee as an explanation in the\u000a      failure to combat\u000a      corruption. These findings were communicated to UN organisations including\u000a      UNDESA (United\u000a      Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs) (see section 4).\u000a    As stated earlier, the empirical survey which was an integral part of the\u000a      research conducted,\u000a      formed an important contribution to the study and provided invaluable\u000a      insight and expertise to the\u000a      researchers. The survey exposed a surprising lack of awareness on the part\u000a      of UK companies\u000a      (who were seen by the international community as major suppliers of\u000a      bribes) of the anti-corruption\u000a      developments at both national and international level, and a commonly held\u000a      belief that corruption\u000a      was not an issue in their companies. This at a time when the BAE\u000a      allegations of bribery in the\u000a      Saudi arms deal (al-Yamamah contract) and the subsequent investigation by\u000a      the Serious Fraud\u000a      Office were making headlines in the broad sheets on a daily basis. The\u000a      research also exposed that\u000a      the level of engagement between CSOs and the private sector was negligible\u000a      which indicated that\u000a      CSOs also had to make a concentrated effort in engaging with the different\u000a      business sectors.\u000a      (Part of the research for this case study was funded by the AHRC and was\u000a      conducted by Carr (PI)\u000a      and Outhwaite (PDRA) between during 2007 - 2010.)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40569","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The work undertaken on the law and practice of statutory nuisance has\u000d\u000a      been part of a process of engagement over the last 20 years with the\u000d\u000a      environmental health profession involving most local authorities engaged\u000d\u000a      in environmental health in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\u000d\u000a      The research has made an impact on judicial decision-making, government\u000d\u000a      policy, better enforcement procedures through the training of enforcement\u000d\u000a      officers thus contributing to the health and wellbeing of citizens.\u000d\u000a    Impact on judicial reasoning in noise cases (wind farms and theme\u000d\u000a          parks)\u000d\u000a    The research has impacted on the way in which judges have decided their\u000d\u000a      decisions remain good law.

It was\u000d\u000a      found that the sanitary legislation in the 1840s dealt with the problems\u000d\u000a      of lack of sanitation relating in the cholera outbreaks as well as crowded\u000d\u000a      living conditions within the slum urban developments which arose during\u000d\u000a      this period of rapid industrial growth, the keeping of animals in close\u000d\u000a      proximity with humans in towns and the problems of factory emissions\u000d\u000a      causing respiratory diseases. This same piece of legislation was then\u000d\u000a      expanded to include modern forms of pollution such as noise, light and\u000d\u000a      insects. The research found that this resulted in legislation, which was\u000d\u000a      difficult to interpret and apply on the ground by government enforcement\u000d\u000a      officers and that the regulatory framework in place was unfit for purpose\u000d\u000a      and needed root and branch overhaul by Parliament. In the absence of that\u000d\u000a      overhaul the codes of practice are a necessary bridging mechanism and the\u000d\u000a      findings of this research were fed into such policy initiatives. The\u000d\u000a      research also found that the enforcement procedures were not uniformly\u000d\u000a      applied and abatement practices were not robustly carried out resulting in\u000d\u000a      inadequate resolution of public health problems.

By pinpointing barriers to diversity, research\u000a      commissioned from UCL Laws has had the following impacts:\u000a    \u000a      Genn's senior practitioners' study [a] resulted in better-informed\u000a        outreach work by the Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC) and senior\u000a        judiciary. It identified messages that needed to be communicated to\u000a        under-represented groups such as women, minorities and solicitors. The\u000a        study's finding that the requirement to go on circuit and lack of\u000a        flexible working was for some highly qualified practitioners an absolute\u000a        block on application to the High Court, has led to greater emphasis on\u000a        allowing flexibility regarding circuit requirements and contributed to\u000a        the introduction of legislative provision for flexible working for the\u000a        High Court introduced in April 2013 [13]. Judicial Statistics show a\u000a        significant increase in women appointed to the High Court from 10 in\u000a        2008 (9%) to 18 in 2013 (17%) [5].\u000a      Thomas's recommendation for improved diversity data collection was\u000a        implemented by the JAC and Ministry of Justice in 2010, supporting the\u000a        evaluation of changes in JAC practice and enabling more reliable\u000a        assessment of progress toward diversity (Recommendation 8 in [1]);\u000a      Thomas's research findings on diversity influenced the recommendations\u000a        of the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution's 2011\u000a        investigation into Judicial Appointments [3], including shortlists (at\u000a        36), merit (at 70, 73, 95), and membership of the JAC and selection\u000a        committees (at 155) to improve selection processes and produce more\u000a        diverse appointments;\u000a      In 2011, UCLJI created a Judicial Skills CPD course for lawyers\u000a        considering applying for judicial appointment [12].

Responses to Genn's\u000a        recommendations include more use of participative learning, modular\u000a        options in continuation training, and a new cross-jurisdictional course\u000a        The Craft of Judging, introduced in 2010 [7, p. 8] and reviewed\u000a        favourably in the press in 2012 [11]. Since 2008, the framework of\u000a        judicial abilities and qualities (JAQ), which Genn drafted from her\u000a        research findings, has been used as the basis for the development of all\u000a        judicial training in England and Wales [8, p. 3] and has been adopted\u000a        abroad [8].\u000a    \u000a    Genn's judicial training needs research and recommendations for change in\u000a      Scotland [f] were accepted and implemented [9, p. i, iii] and led to the:\u000a    \u000a      Development of a new training programme [9, p. 2] and the\u000a        establishment of the Judicial Institute for Scotland (JIS) in 2012\u000a        costing over &#163;900,000, which has transformed the approach and facilities\u000a        for judicial education. In 2013 the JIS commissioned the UCLJI to review\u000a        and evaluate the quality of the training introduced in response to the\u000a        2008 report (to be completed by 2015) [16].\u000a    \u000a    Thomas's review of judicial diversity strategies in other jurisdictions:\u000a    \u000a      Highlighted the need for greater exposure of lawyers to the work of\u000a        judges before applying for appointment and led to the Neuberger Panel\u000a        recommendations that judicial skills training be offered to lawyers\u000a        interested in applying for a judicial post [1, para. 71, 81] and the\u000a        establishment of the UCLJI CPD course Understanding Judging [2,\u000a        12].\u000a    \u000a    Thomas's review of judicial education and training in 12 jurisdictions:\u000a    \u000a      Contributed to the framework and deliverables for all four\u000a        Workpackages in the European Commission \"Menu for Justice\" Project.

Initiated by the Lord Chief Justice to\u000a      inform the outreach strategy of the Judicial Office and the Judicial\u000a      Appointments Commission's review of its appointment procedures, this is\u000a      the only research of its kind in the UK. The study [a], involving\u000a      interviews with serving judiciary and practitioners, revealed that:\u000a    \u000a      Key attractions of High Court appointment include intellectual\u000a        challenge, opportunity to shape the law, prestige and commitment to\u000a        public service;\u000a      Key deterrents disproportionately affecting women and primary carers\u000a        were the requirement for High Court judges to spend several weeks in\u000a        courts out of London every year, the lack of flexibility and isolation\u000a        of the role.\u000a    \u000a    Prompted by concerns over the slow progress toward increasing diversity\u000a      in the English and Welsh judiciary, in 2009 the Lord Chancellor's Advisory\u000a      Panel on Judicial Diversity commissioned Professor Cheryl Thomas\u000a      (Co-Director, UCLJI) to conduct research analysing the effectiveness of\u000a      judicial diversity strategies in other jurisdictions with those in the UK.\u000a      This study [b] found that:\u000a    \u000a      Other jurisdictions had implemented more pro-active strategies to\u000a        address diversity;\u000a      Strategies are most successful when directed at specific judicial\u000a        levels;\u000a      The Judicial Appointments Commission's unique rules work against\u000a        increasing diversity;\u000a      Judicial diversity data in England and Wales were deficient and\u000a        unreliable.\u000a    \u000a    In 2008-09, the UCL CICT was funded by the AHRC to conduct research on\u000a      judicial selection in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and\u000a      International Criminal Court (ICC). The team was led by Professor Philippe\u000a      Sands, Director of CICT, and included researchers from CICT and Queen Mary\u000a      University. Using interviews, case studies and survey data, the study [c]\u000a      found that:\u000a    \u000a      Selection of international court judges is often controlled by small\u000a        groups of diplomats, civil servants, lawyers and academics.\u000a      This politicises the process, works against the selection of the most\u000a        highly qualified candidates and undermines judicial independence.\u000a    \u000a    Judicial education and training\u000a      England and Wales: In 2006 the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), as\u000a      part of their Training Strategy Review, commissioned Genn to undertake an\u000a      empirical study of the training needs of the English judiciary and to\u000a      develop a Framework of Judicial Abilities and Qualities (JAQ) to\u000a      support the JSB's strategic objective to improve standards and integrate\u000a      diversity issues into the design and delivery of training. The study\u000a      involved focus group discussions and individual interviews with over 500\u000a      District, Circuit and High Court judges. The 2006 report [d] identified\u000a      the challenges faced by the judiciary, their development needs and\u000a      training preferences. Key findings were that:\u000a    \u000a      There should be a greater emphasis on judicial skills development and\u000a        the use of problem-based participative learning;\u000a      Training in cross-jurisdictional judgecraft skills should be made\u000a        available;\u000a      Training should be more flexible and better geared to judges'\u000a        individual needs.\u000a    \u000a    From this, Genn developed a JAQ, which was distributed for consultation\u000a      to the judiciary and key interested parties (including the Judicial\u000a      Executive Board, Bar Council and Law Society), and after receiving wide\u000a      approval was published by the JSB in 2008.\u000a    Scotland: Following the England &amp; Wales study, in 2007 Genn\u000a      was commissioned to conduct similar research for the Scottish Judicial\u000a      Studies Committee (JSC). This involved observing judicial training and\u000a      discussion groups with 90 serving judiciary at all levels (comprising\u000a      one-third of the Scottish judiciary). The final report was published in\u000a      August 2008 [f].\u000a    Europe: As part of the JSB 2006&#8212;09 review of judicial training,\u000a      Thomas was commissioned to conduct a review of judicial training and\u000a      education in 12 other jurisdictions. This involved surveys and interviews\u000a      with training leaders and judges in 9 European jurisdictions plus\u000a      Australia, the US and Canada. The report [e] identified how training\u000a      structures and evaluation approaches in jurisdictions affected training\u000a      methods, content and barriers. Based on this report, in 2009 Thomas was\u000a      commissioned to help design the framework for the European Commission Menu\u000a        for Justice Project.

Transcribe\u000d\u000a        Bentham recruited an active user community engaged in heavyweight\u000d\u000a      transcription. This is remarkable because, unlike most crowdsourcing\u000d\u000a      projects where material is straightforward to decipher, Bentham\u000d\u000a      manuscripts are not easy to read. The result is that the project has also\u000d\u000a      helped to develop IT and analytical skills among the public:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Only a minority of transcribers had ever worked with manuscripts or\u000d\u000a        had any specialised training in reading historical handwriting prior to\u000d\u000a        taking part in Transcribe Bentham [9, para. 42].\u000d\u000a      Bentham's handwriting is complex and time-consuming, requiring\u000d\u000a        concentration and commitment. Many transcribers found the intellectual\u000d\u000a        challenge and puzzle-solving aspect of transcription enjoyable and\u000d\u000a        highly rewarding, with several comparing deciphering Bentham's\u000d\u000a        handwriting to solving a crossword or Sudoku [9, para. 56].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The truly unique and innovative impact of Transcribe Bentham has\u000d\u000a      been recognised internationally, winning the 2011 Prix Ars Electronica\u000d\u000a      Award of Distinction in this leading Digital Arts competition:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The 2011 Prix Ars Electronica jury commended Transcribe\u000d\u000a          Bentham for its \"potential to become a standard tool for\u000d\u000a          scholarly crowdsourcing projects\", and its \"potential to create\u000d\u000a          the legacy of participatory education and the preservation of heritage\u000d\u000a          or an endangered culture\" [2, p. 206].\u000d\u000a      \u000aTranscribe Bentham was also shortlisted for the 2011 Digital\u000a          Heritage Award [13].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Influencing worldwide transcription and the wider information sector\u000d\u000a    Transcribe Bentham demonstrates that there is a worldwide audience\u000d\u000a      of potential volunteers who are willing and able to engage in demanding\u000d\u000a      crowdsourced tasks. If untrained volunteers are able to transcribe the\u000d\u000a      papers of Jeremy Bentham, some of which border on the illegible, this has\u000d\u000a      shown that they can transcribe almost anything. The Bentham Project has\u000d\u000a      made the code for the transcription tool freely available to download [d],\u000d\u000a      and Transcribe Bentham and its outreach activities are being used\u000d\u000a      as a model for other similar initiatives worldwide. For example:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The Public Record Office of Victoria has launched a pilot project with\u000d\u000a        the public to transcribe historical documents in its archive, using the\u000d\u000a        Transcribe Bentham transcription tool [6].\u000d\u000a      The Transcribe Bentham image viewer and transcription toolbar\u000d\u000a        is now being used by the Irish Letters of 1916: Creating History\u000d\u000a        project (based at Trinity College Dublin) [12].\u000d\u000a      Bentham Project staff have been consulted on how the initiative can be\u000d\u000a        used elsewhere by: the Natural History Museum, National Library of the\u000d\u000a        Netherlands, Library and Archives Canada, Royal Library in Denmark, San\u000d\u000a        Diego Natural History Museum, J. Paul Getty Research Institution and\u000d\u000a        Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints [10].\u000d\u000a      The European Commission-funded TranScriptorium project is using\u000d\u000a        the Transcribe Bentham transcription tool as a prototype tool\u000d\u000a        for crowdsourcing material in other languages as part of its wider\u000d\u000a        project to develop computers and programmes to read handwriting.\u000d\u000a        Consortium partners include the Dutch Institute for Lexicology and Greek\u000d\u000a        National Centre for Scientific Research, as well a number of academic\u000d\u000a        institutions: the University of Valencia, University of Innsbruck,\u000d\u000a        University of London Computer Centre and UCL's Bentham Project [9].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Advancing the Bentham Project\u000d\u000a    Given that the transcription task is much more onerous and demanding than\u000d\u000a      in most other crowdsourcing projects, the amount of work completed by Transcribe\u000a        Bentham volunteers is quite remarkable. Volunteers transcribed an\u000d\u000a      average of thirty-five manuscripts each week [9, para. 45]:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      This has speeded up publication of The Collected Works. It is\u000d\u000a        estimated that Transcribe Bentham could save between six months\u000d\u000a        and one year of an academic editor's time [10].\u000d\u000a      Without Transcribe Bentham, it will take at least 70 years to\u000d\u000a        transcribe the remaining Bentham Papers. With Transcribe Bentham\u000d\u000a        volunteers transcribing at the current rate, it will take about 35\u000d\u000a        years. If more volunteers can be recruited, it could be done in 12-17\u000d\u000a        years.\u000d\u000a      These user-generated transcripts will be added progressively to the\u000d\u000a        Digital Repository, and in this way the whole Collection is being\u000d\u000a        further enhanced as time goes on.\u000d\u000a      The project has resulted in significant publicity for Bentham studies,\u000d\u000a        history and philosophy more generally. In a 2010 roundup of\u000d\u000a        crowd-sourced transcription, the software engineer and expert on\u000d\u000a        crowdsourcing Ben Brumfield noted that Transcribe Bentham has\u000d\u000a        done \"more than any other transcription tool to publicize the field\"\u000d\u000a        [3].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Thus, the Project has proven how right Bentham was when he wrote: \"Many\u000a        hands make light work.

Bentham's views were visionary, and it was recognised that\u000d\u000a      they had great significance for contemporary debates on important issues\u000d\u000a      such as prison reform, international law, religion, democracy, sexuality\u000d\u000a      and animal welfare. The problem confronting the Bentham Project was how to\u000d\u000a      decipher the thousands of folios (and millions of words) Bentham had left\u000d\u000a      behind.\u000d\u000a    Achieving the goal of the Bentham Project requires transcribing and then\u000d\u000a      analysing all the manuscripts in the vast collection of Bentham Papers\u000d\u000a      held by UCL, as well as those in the British Library. The UCL collection\u000d\u000a      forms the main body, with approximately 60,000 folios (c. 30 million\u000d\u000a      words). Professor Philip Schofield, Director of the Bentham Project since\u000d\u000a      2001, has pioneered an award-winning, innovative approach to solving this\u000d\u000a      problem, which harnesses the power of the internet and the public around\u000d\u000a      the world to transcribe Bentham's words for the 21st century.\u000d\u000a    Bentham Papers Catalogue: The first step was to conduct research\u000d\u000a      on the UCL folios to create a catalogue of all the manuscripts.\u000d\u000a      Schofield's core research, which has produced 8 volumes of the Collected\u000a        Works [a], provided him with a deep understanding of the manuscripts\u000d\u000a      and enabled him to devise the specification for the entire catalogue. From\u000d\u000a      2003-06 Schofield designed and led an AHRC-funded project that produced a\u000d\u000a      searchable Catalogue [b] of all the Bentham Papers held at UCL, with\u000d\u000a      Deborah McVea compiling the catalogue under Schofield's direction.\u000d\u000a    Digital Database: With a Catalogue, Schofield then set out to\u000d\u000a      create a Digital Database [c] of high quality Bentham manuscript images\u000d\u000a      and a transcription tool for online transcription. Under an AHRC grant, in\u000d\u000a      2010-11 Schofield worked collaboratively with UCL Library Services (Martin\u000d\u000a      Moyle) and UCL Design, Photography and Web Services (Tony Slade) to create\u000d\u000a      digital images, and he guided the University of London Computer Centre\u000d\u000a      (Richard Davies) in programming a transcription tool according to his\u000d\u000a      specification for encoding the manuscript elements. Schofield also led a\u000d\u000a      team of Bentham Project Research Associates Justin Tonra (1\/5\/10-30\/9\/10),\u000d\u000a      Valerie Wallace (12\/4\/10-31\/3\/11) and Tim Causer (1\/10\/10-present) that\u000d\u000a      produced a transcription tutorial, Transcription Desk and image viewer.\u000d\u000a      Out of this Digital Database came the idea to harness the internet and the\u000d\u000a      public to accelerate the pace of transcription (crowdsourcing).\u000d\u000a    Transcribe Bentham: Launched in September 2010, the crowdsourcing\u000d\u000a      project Transcribe Bentham [d] was formulated as an experiment:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Could volunteers without previous training read and decipher Bentham's\u000d\u000a        handwriting and deal with composition and structural features of the\u000d\u000a        manuscripts?\u000d\u000a      Could the public then mark the manuscripts up in the required encoded\u000d\u000a        text language?\u000d\u000a      Could the public navigate Bentham's idiosyncratic style and his dense\u000d\u000a        and challenging ideas?\u000d\u000a      Would the work be of sufficient quality to be used in the Bentham\u000d\u000a        Project's editorial work?\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Anyone in the world with an internet connection can participate in Transcribe\u000a        Bentham. After registering, participants transcribe Bentham's\u000d\u000a      manuscripts into a text box and encode the features of the manuscripts in\u000d\u000a      Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) compliant language (XML). Schofield worked\u000d\u000a      with UCL Digital Humanities (Melissa Terras) on designing outreach for Transcribe\u000a        Bentham, and his research team conducted follow up research in 2011\u000d\u000a      [e] to measure the project's success.\u000d\u000a    Having demonstrated that Transcribe Bentham could produce public\u000d\u000a      transcription of sufficient quality to serve as a basis for the Bentham\u000d\u000a      Project's editorial work, in 2012 Schofield secured funding from the\u000d\u000a      Mellon Foundation to create a publicly accessible Digital Repository\u000d\u000a      for the Bentham Papers [f]. This includes the British Library Papers, and\u000d\u000a      will reunite in digital form the collection broken up at Bentham's death.\u000d\u000a      Transcribe Bentham also became part of TranScriptorium in\u000d\u000a      2012, a European Commission funded project which uses the Transcribe\u000d\u000a        Bentham transcription tool as a prototype for transcription in other\u000d\u000a      languages.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40597","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Those benefiting from the research are numerous and varied, including:\u000d\u000a      the judiciary of England and Wales, HMCTS, MoJ, Judicial College, Law\u000d\u000a      Commission of England and Wales, criminal law professionals, public as\u000d\u000a      serving jurors and defendants in serious criminal trials. The research [a,\u000d\u000a      b] has been widely covered in the press and generated substantial public\u000d\u000a      debate [13]. It has also been highlighted by the senior judiciary as\u000d\u000a      influential in judicial thinking about the future of trial by jury in this\u000d\u000a      country [3] and been used in reviews of the jury system in other\u000d\u000a      jurisdictions, e.g. Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the US\u000d\u000a      [7, 9, 10]. Benefits arising from the research include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Resolving long-standing concerns about the need for: racially balanced\u000d\u000a        juries, anonymity for those accused of rape, and change in upper age\u000d\u000a        limit for jury service;\u000d\u000a      Reforming official government reporting of conviction rates;\u000d\u000a      Prompting re-evaluation of judges' use of written directions;\u000d\u000a      Helping to prevent improper juror conduct and improve deliberations;\u000d\u000a      Influencing Law Commission proposals on reforms of contempt and\u000d\u000a        insanity laws.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Racially-balanced juries: Are Juries Fair? [a] resolved\u000d\u000a      long-standing concerns that racially balanced juries are needed to ensure\u000d\u000a      fairness in trials of ethnic minority defendants through its robust\u000d\u000a      evidence that all-White juries do not discriminate against ethnic minority\u000d\u000a      defendants. Previous reviews (Auld Review and the Runciman Commission) had\u000d\u000a      recommended racially balanced juries, but acknowledged that they did so in\u000d\u000a      the absence of reliable research, and this research has resulted in\u000d\u000a      abandonment of proposals to artificially construct racially mixed juries\u000d\u000a      [1].\u000d\u000a    Re-evaluation of juries and rape cases: The research [a] also\u000d\u000a      provided robust empirical evidence that, contrary to popular belief and\u000d\u000a      previous official reports, juries convict more often than they acquit in\u000d\u000a      rape. These findings were cited in the independent review of how public\u000d\u000a      authorities handle rape complaints (Stern Review 2010), and were relied on\u000d\u000a      in the report's conclusion that it was not realistic to achieve a much\u000d\u000a      higher jury conviction rate in rape cases [4, pp. 15, 16, 43, 91, 92, 94].\u000d\u000a      The research findings on jury conviction rates in rape cases and media\u000d\u000a      coverage of jury trials [a] were further relied upon in the 2010\u000d\u000a      government review on providing anonymity for those accused of rape [5, p.\u000d\u000a      vi, 19, 20, 21, 23, 32, 33].\u000d\u000a    Official reporting of conviction rates: Are Juries Fair?\u000d\u000a      [a] identified that official conviction rates in Crown Courts do not\u000d\u000a      distinguish between guilty pleas and verdicts decided by a jury and can\u000d\u000a      therefore provide misleading information about conviction rates. This was\u000d\u000a      relied upon in the Stern Review's call for a re-evaluation of how official\u000d\u000a      conviction rates for rape are reported, and the recommendation that the\u000d\u000a      publication of crime statistics always be accompanied by enough\u000d\u000a      explanation to ensure that their meaning can be widely understood and\u000d\u000a      makes clear what conclusions can and cannot be drawn from those data [4,\u000d\u000a      pp. 10, 18, 32, 33]. It was also relied on by the MoJ in its decision to\u000d\u000a      work with the National Statistician to clarify rape conviction rates and\u000d\u000a      review how conviction rates are measured in official government\u000d\u000a      statistical bulletins for all offences [5, p. vi, 19, 20, 21, 23].\u000d\u000a    Re-evaluation of the use of written legal directions: The findings\u000d\u000a      that juror comprehension of legal directions can be substantially improved\u000d\u000a      when a written summary is provided at the same time as the judge gives\u000d\u000a      oral legal directions to the jury [a] and that jurors prefer written\u000d\u000a      directions [b] has prompted a re-evaluation of the use of written\u000d\u000a      directions by the judiciary in England and Wales. In 2010 the Court of\u000d\u000a      Appeal relied on the findings [a] in R v Thompson et al in the\u000d\u000a      guidance it provided to the judiciary on using written directions [2,\u000d\u000a      para. 13, 94], and it is now common practice for written directions to be\u000d\u000a      used in most jury trials in England and Wales. The Irish Law Reform\u000d\u000a      Commission also relied on this research [a] in recommending that jurors\u000d\u000a      should have written information provided to them in all cases to aid\u000d\u000a      comprehension [9, para. 10.24-10.26].\u000d\u000a    Upper age limit for jury service: Findings [a] on the ability of\u000d\u000a      jurors from different age groups to comprehend judicial instructions, and\u000d\u000a      analysis of the proportion of each age group serving as jurors at each\u000d\u000a      Crown Court in England and Wales was relied upon by the government in\u000d\u000a      considering whether to raise the upper age limit for jury service to 75\u000d\u000a      [6, p.19]. This research was also relied upon by the Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a      Department of Justice in its 2011 Consultation Paper examining whether\u000d\u000a      there should be an upper age limit for jurors [7, pp. 3, 34, 56, 62].\u000d\u000a    Insanity defence: The Law Commission relied upon the research\u000d\u000a      finding [c] that jury verdicts of \"not guilty by reason of insanity\" are\u000d\u000a      extremely rare in deciding in 2012 that it could not proceed directly with\u000d\u000a      proposals to reform the insanity defence law [11, para. 1.3 and 1.4]. This\u000d\u000a      resulted in the Law Commission taking the unusual step of issuing a\u000d\u000a      \"scoping paper\" to find out how the defence operates in practice [12,\u000d\u000a      para. 1.23, 1.40, 1.44].\u000d\u000a    Contempt, the media and improper juror conduct: The research\u000d\u000a      findings on improper juror conduct [a, b] have had far-reaching impacts on\u000d\u000a      jury reforms in this jurisdiction and abroad. Findings that a substantial\u000d\u000a      proportion of jurors were uncertain what to do about improper conduct [a]\u000d\u000a      were relied upon in the Court of Appeal's 2010 judgment, R v Thompson\u000d\u000a        et al, in which it recommended that HMCTS should consult the\u000d\u000a      Judicial College on how best to explain to jurors their collective\u000d\u000a      responsibility, and that judges should direct juries on their collective\u000d\u000a      responsibility as part of their initial remarks to the jury after they\u000d\u000a      were sworn [2, para. 7, 8]. Findings on juror use of the internet [a] have\u000d\u000a      also been relied upon by:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The Law Commission for England and Wales in its 2013 review of\u000d\u000a        Contempt of Court in proposals for reducing contempts committed by\u000d\u000a        jurors involving use of the intent and modern media [8, para. 1.9, 2.25,\u000d\u000a        4.16, 4.23, 4.28, 4.55];\u000d\u000a      The Irish Law Reform Commission in proposals that specific statutory\u000d\u000a        provisions and administrative arrangements be put in place to reduce the\u000d\u000a        risk of inappropriate juror use of the internet [9, para. 8.18, 8.19,\u000d\u000a        8.24];\u000d\u000a      The US National Center for State Courts in its review of jurors' use\u000d\u000a        of new media, citing the research as the only systematically-based\u000d\u000a        estimate of juror misconduct anywhere in the world [10, p.3].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by the UCL Jury Project has directly influenced government and\u000d\u000a      judicial policies and practices and public debate both in the UK and\u000d\u000a      abroad.

Two years later, the\u000a      Succession to the Crown Act was passed, reforming the law to remove male\u000a      preference in the line of succession, to remove disqualification from the\u000a      throne arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic, and to limit the\u000a      requirement for the monarch's permission to marry to the six persons next\u000a      in line to the throne. These reforms are of exceptional benefit to the UK\u000a      public. The 2011 Act adds overdue stability and fairness to the political\u000a      process, while strengthening economic planning in the public and private\u000a      sectors by providing certainty over when the next election and possible\u000a      change of government will occur. The 2013 Act in turn modernises and\u000a      stabilises an institution that is a cornerstone of the UK's constitution\u000a      and holds significant symbolic meaning for many UK and Commonwealth\u000a      citizens. For both these important statutory changes, Blackburn's research\u000a      and interventions had a significant impact on policy makers, by providing\u000a      clarity and authoritative analysis in a complex and little understood area\u000a      of law and convention, and by contributing to public and Parliamentary\u000a      debate on reform and helping shape the legislative framework. A senior\u000a      parliamentarian describes Blackburn's contributions to both Acts as being\u000a      `material and valuable contributions' to some of the `most important\u000a      constitutional reforms in the history of the UK' [16].\u000a    Contribution to policy debate\u000a    Blackburn has participated directly with the royal household, government\u000a      and parliamentary bodies to help inform and shape thinking on how the\u000a      monarchy can modernise and evolve. In 2004 he gave a lecture at the\u000a      Department for Constitutional Affairs (subsequently published as an\u000a      article [2]) which was attended by the Queen's Private Secretary, and made\u000a      the case for reconfiguring conventions governing the monarch's exercise of\u000a      prerogative powers, including election timing. Blackburn further put into\u000a      the public domain his analysis of the role of the monarch in hung\u000a      Parliament situations in a prominently placed letter to The Times\u000a      in 2009 [10] and in a co-authored Hansard Society pamphlet [8]\u000a      launched in the House of Commons in early 2010.\u000a    Regarding the law on royal marriages and succession, Blackburn's research\u000a      and writings (including King &amp; Country) were quoted in House\u000a      of Commons Library papers [9] given to MPs and peers prior to\u000a      parliamentary debates on the subject during the six years between\u000a      publication of his 2006 book and preparation of the Succession to the\u000a      Crown Act 2013. During this period, Blackburn also presented his research\u000a      in public talks, including a public lecture in March 2007 at the Institute\u000a      of Advanced Legal Studies, and at a joint Kings College London\/Ipsos-MORI\u000a      conference on the monarchy in November 2012 attended by over 100 people.\u000a      He also spoke in the media on royal succession and modernisation issues on\u000a      numerous occasions [10].\u000a    Shaping legislation\u000a    When the House of Lords Constitution Committee examined the Coalition\u000a      government's constitutional reform programme in the early months of the\u000a      new Parliament, Blackburn gave oral evidence on the proposal for\u000a      fixed-term Parliaments [11]. During the Bill's passage, Lord Lloyd (the\u000a      former Law Lord) stated that Blackburn's evidence was \"important because\u000a      he is the man who has made a particular study of this very issue\", while\u000a      Lord Norton (himself a constitutional law expert) observed that\u000a      Blackburn's work The Electoral System in Britain was one of just\u000a      two works to have considered the issue in detail since the 1970's [14].\u000a      When the Fixed-term Parliaments Bill was introduced shortly afterwards,\u000a      Blackburn was the sole expert invited to give oral evidence to the House\u000a      of Commons Political and Constitutional Reform Committee to inform second\u000a      reading debate [12]. He also prepared written evidence for the Committee\u000a      which was published in the report and was explicitly mentioned in the\u000a      Government response [12]. During parliamentary consideration of the\u000a      legislation, Blackburn was invited to several meetings and gave a number\u000a      of lectures to audiences comprising politicians, government and\u000a      parliamentary officials, and academics [13]. These informed discussion and\u000a      built support for the reform and how it might be framed. He or his\u000a      research was cited on several occasions in parliamentary debates on the\u000a      Bill [14]. Through these interactions, Blackburn's research had a distinct\u000a      and material impact on parliamentary opinion, scrutiny and debate leading\u000a      to the passage of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011.\u000a    The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 reached the statute book on 23 April\u000a      2013. Blackburn's research and writings were persuasive factors in\u000a      parliamentarians and ministers taking up the case for modernising the law\u000a      on succession to the Crown and royal marriages, and in influencing how the\u000a      reforming legislation was framed so to achieve its social and political\u000a      objectives. Shortly after the Coalition government announced its intention\u000a      to introduce the Succession to the Crown Bill, Blackburn was requested to\u000a      give oral evidence to the House of Commons Political and Constitutional\u000a      Reform Committee on 10 November 2011 as one of only two experts [15].\u000a      Remarkably he was author of the only written memorandum of evidence for\u000a      the Committee on the subject published in its Report [15]. The final\u000a      provisions of the Act reflect closely the detailed research, analysis and\u000a      proposals in Blackburn's book [5]. In particular Section 1 superseded the\u000a      common law doctrine of male primogeniture, which reflected Blackburn's\u000a      argument that the law relating to the royal Head of State was of great\u000a      symbolic importance and must evolve to reflect changing social values.\u000a      Section 2 retrospectively applied removal of disqualification from\u000a      marriage to a Catholic where the person concerned is alive. The Royal\u000a      Marriages Act of 1772 was repealed and Section 3 introduced a new\u000a      statutory provision limiting the need for such consent to a small number\u000a      of persons closest in line to the throne, whilst removing the requirement,\u000a      as Blackburn had argued, for all descendants of George II to have\u000a      the Monarch's permission. All these provisions were highlighted to\u000a      policymakers on the basis of Blackburn's research and substantive\u000a      engagement.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    There has been growing public and political debate on modernising the\u000a      monarchy since the early 1990s, seeking to ensure the law best serves and\u000a      harmonises with UK society for symbolic as well as practical purposes.\u000a      However constitutional law is a highly complex area. Initiatives to\u000a      replace uncertain 'floating' election timing with fixed-term Parliaments\u000a      would involve reform of the ancient royal prerogative to dissolve\u000a      Parliament. To allow female succession, or permit the monarch to marry a\u000a      Roman Catholic, would mean overturning common law doctrine and ancient\u000a      statutes respectively. Professor Blackburn's research and interventions\u000a      have directly informed two historic legislative changes: the Fixed-term\u000a      Parliaments Act 2011 and the Succession to the Crown Act 2013. His\u000a      publications-leading academic works on the subject &#8212; were widely\u000a      consulted by policymakers and cited in parliamentary documents. He also\u000a      presented evidence to the constitutional reform committees of both Houses\u000a      of Parliament.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    King's College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"King's College London","InstitutionName":"King's College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003645}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Political interest in the idea of fixed-term\u000a      Parliaments was gathering momentum: it was proposed in Labour's 1992\u000a      election manifesto and had also been Liberal Democrat policy since 1992.\u000a      The rules on election timing have been a complex mix of ancient law,\u000a      constitutional history and modern political practice, and Blackburn's\u000a      1993-95 research was the first major study to analyse the inherent\u000a      problems of election timing being governed by the legal act of the\u000a      monarch, and to put forward a case for fixed-term Parliaments outlining\u000a      options for a new legislative framework. He examined the legal regulation\u000a      of the royal prerogative, the evolution of unwritten constitutional\u000a      conventions, little-understood procedural aspects of calling a general\u000a      election and the political advantage derived by Prime Ministers as adviser\u000a      to the monarch. The work produced coherent conclusions on conventions\u000a      governing general election timing, government formation following an\u000a      inconclusive result, and legitimate circumstances for calling an early\u000a      second general election. Blackburn continued to generate research leading\u000a      up to the 2011 Act. A publication in 2004 [2] addressed the theory and\u000a      practice of the role of the monarch in dissolution, and the legitimacy of\u000a      Prime Ministers calling an early second general election in hung\u000a      Parliament situations. His research in 2008-09 [3] analysed a proposal by\u000a      then Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, to make dissolution of Parliament\u000a      subject to a prior formal parliamentary vote. Blackburn opposed this,\u000a      arguing for a statutory framework for fixed-term Parliaments in the\u000a      journal Public Law [3].\u000a    In parallel, Blackburn conducted important primary research on the wider\u000a      role of the monarchy. Research underpinning his contribution to the 2013\u000a      Act was conducted between 2003-06 and published in his book King and\u000a        Country [5], which presented recommendations for modernisation and\u000a      reform. Blackburn examined the ancient common law doctrine of male\u000a      primogeniture as applied to royal succession and argued for its repeal,\u000a      contending that laws relating to the royal Head of State had great\u000a      symbolic importance and must evolve to reflect changing social values\u000a      about equality. He also analysed the ancient legal and religious duties\u000a      imposed on a monarch, notably that he or she cannot be or marry a Roman\u000a      Catholic. Blackburn studied the anomaly of Catholicism being singled out\u000a      for disqualification for political reasons in the 1689 and 1701 statutes,\u000a      and what this signified today. He also examined the Royal Marriages Act\u000a      1772 which declared the marriage of any descendent of King George\u000a      II to be void unless they first obtained formal consent from the reigning\u000a      monarch, and argued for its repeal.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41245","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Since 2008, Bowling's research has contributed to public debate on stop\u000a      and search and has made a wide-ranging substantial impact on police policy\u000a      and practice. Through his engagement with policymakers and his\u000a      contribution to the EHRC's ground-breaking report Stop and Think\u000a      in 2010 [6], Bowling's research has contributed materially to a change in\u000a      behaviour by some of Britain's worst offending police forces. The\u000a      beneficiaries include (i) the EHRC, (ii) UK police forces, (iii) members\u000a      of minority communities, and (iv) the general public, through fairer, more\u000a      efficient, effective and economical use of police power.\u000a    The impact of Bowling's research builds on a foundation of more than a\u000a      decade of public engagement in this field. He has disseminated research\u000a      findings widely in professional journals, national newspapers, radio and\u000a      television broadcasts and public lectures to various audiences including\u000a      senior police officers. He has been a member of, or advisor to, numerous\u000a      local, national and international bodies including the Metropolitan Police\u000a      Racial and Violent Crime Task Force (1999-2001), the UN World Conference\u000a      Against Racism (2001), Home Secretary's Stop and Search Community Panel\u000a      (2004-8) and the Home Affairs Select Committee (2006-7). His research was\u000a      cited in key policy documents including the 2005 APCO Stop and Search\u000a        Manual and he has written expert witness opinions in stop and search\u000a      cases.\u000a    Stopwatch-impact on public debate. In March 2010 Bowling, with\u000a      others, identified the need for a vehicle to disseminate research on stop\u000a      and search. Funded by the Open Society Foundation, Bowling organised a\u000a      conference at King's College London entitled `Where Now for Stop and\u000a      Search' chaired by cross-bench peer Lord Victor Adebowale. More than 100\u000a      people attended, including leading academics, lawyers, police chiefs, the\u000a      Independent Police Complaints Commission, Liberty, Association of Police\u000a      Authorities and civil society groups. Building on the momentum of the\u000a      conference, Bowling co-founded and launched StopWatch (www.stop-watch.org),\u000a      a coalition of researchers, policy-makers, lawyers and young people\u000a      working for fair and effective policing. The launch of StopWatch at King's\u000a      College London by the Reverend Jesse Jackson in October 2010 was attended\u000a      by over 200 people and widely reported in national and international news\u000a      media [14]. Bowling is an active contributor to the organisation, chairing\u000a      meetings, drafting documents and delivering keynote speeches at various\u000a      events [9, 13].\u000a    Today, StopWatch plays a significant role in informing and shaping public\u000a      debate using research evidence and working directly with the police to\u000a      help improve their use of stop and search. It has used a variety of\u000a      innovative mechanisms, including a theatre play (performed at Catford\u000a      Broadway Theatre 26 April - 27 May 2012 and positively reviewed in the\u000a      national press including The Times, Sunday Times and Time Out [14]) and\u000a      video and flash mobs (&gt;4,000 hits) produced by young people to\u000a      stimulate discussion about alternative ways to achieve good policing. The\u000a      theatre play, for example, concluded with Q&amp;A sessions to engage the\u000a      audience with researchers in the field (including Bowling), police\u000a      officers and the cast.\u000a    In the last three years StopWatch, has grown to become a coalition of 75\u000a      organisations and individuals. It undertakes legal and policy analysis,\u000a      political advocacy and supports litigation. It drafts fact-sheets and\u000a      policy briefings, submits evidence to national and international\u000a      organisations and contributes articles to national newspapers, all of\u000a      which are available on its dynamic and interactive website [9, 13]. A\u000a      national journalist describes StopWatch as `one of the most proactive and\u000a      prominent community advocacy groups working in this field' and its\u000a      advocacy as `credible and sober' [11].\u000a    Impact on police practice. In 2009-10 the EHRC appointed Bowling\u000a      as its sole external advisor to a major project aiming to reform police\u000a      stop and search. Working closely with the EHRC, Bowling indicated sources\u000a      of data, scrutinised the use and interpretation of that data, and helped\u000a      the Commission to draw conclusions and to develop a robust narrative.\u000a      According to a senior EHRC official, Bowling's research [3, 4] provided\u000a      the foundation for the approach taken in the report that\u000a      disproportionality in stop and search was de facto indicative of unlawful\u000a      racial discrimination thereby giving the EHRC the confidence to proceed\u000a      against offending police forces on this basis [8]. Moreover Bowling's\u000a      concept of `good enough policing' provided the EHRC with the conceptual\u000a      framework required by it to work constructively with offending police\u000a      forces [8]. In addition to providing the report with its underpinning\u000a      conceptual foundation and framework, Bowling's research is drawn on\u000a      extensively in the final report [6], including seven direct references and\u000a      explicit acknowledgement of Bowling's contribution. Stop and Think\u000a      concludes with a `vision of `good enough' policing', thereby placing\u000a      Bowling's concept at the heart of the analysis and advocating a method of\u000a      engagement inspired by this approach [8].\u000a    Following its publication in April 2010, the impact of the EHRC report\u000a      has been wide-ranging and significant. Based on the report's findings, the\u000a      EHRC entered into negotiations with five poorly performing police forces,\u000a      initiating legal enforcement action against two forces using its powers\u000a      under the Equality Act 2006. Following negotiation with the EHRC, and the\u000a      implementation of training and development packages based on Stop and\u000a        Think, all five forces committed to take steps to improve their stop\u000a      and search practice. Their progress was tracked by the EHRC and reported\u000a      in its follow up report, Stop and Think Again, published in May\u000a      2013 [7] and widely reported in the UK press. This report shows that in\u000a      all police forces targeted by the EHRC, levels of disproportionality fell\u000a      and the `hit-rate' for stops rose. Use of the power fell in all five\u000a      forces by between 20% and 50% concurrent in some forces with downward\u000a      crime trends. Senior officers from both the EHRC and the police\u000a      acknowledge Bowling's significant contribution to this result [8, 12].\u000a    In March 2011, the government introduced changes to the Police and\u000a      Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) Code of Practice A allowing police forces\u000a      discretion to choose whether or not to record `stop and account'\u000a      (introduced following the Lawrence Inquiry). Bowling worked with StopWatch\u000a      to produce a briefing note, based on his research [3, 4], arguing that the\u000a      evidence showed that recording was important to inform people why they had\u000a      been stopped and hold the police to account [10]. This was submitted to\u000a      the Metropolitan Police Authority consultation and Bowling spoke at the\u000a      hearing. The consultation concluded that recording was important for\u000a      fairness, effectiveness, transparency and accountability and\u000a      overwhelmingly supported by the public. Following this intervention, the\u000a      Metropolitan Police decided to continue to record stop and account.\u000a    In recent months there have been welcome new developments. In July 2013,\u000a      the Home Secretary launched a public consultation on use of stop and\u000a      search powers. Reporting on this announcement, the BBC referred to Stop\u000a        and Think Again noting that the reduction in stop and search as\u000a      reported by the EHRC had not compromised crime reduction [14]. The Home\u000a      Secretary's announcement foreshadowed the release of a report by Her\u000a      Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) later the same month on the\u000a      use by police of stop and search powers. This report cites both EHRC\u000a      reports and a senior officer within the HMIC confirms that the HMIC's\u000a      thinking in preparing its report had been influenced by the 2010 EHRC\u000a      report and Bowling's research in particular [12].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Safety and liberty &#8212; public goods delivered by the police &#8212; are important\u000a      to every individual and essential to a civilised society.

The debate was polarised\u000a      with police arguing on pragmatic grounds that disproportionality was not\u000a      indicative of institutional racism, but an inevitable product of\u000a      differences in crime rates among different ethnic groups and their\u000a      concentration in the places and at the times that stop and search is\u000a      carried out. Reformers in turn argued that disproportionality was\u000a      unacceptable in principle and indicative of discriminatory police\u000a      practice.\u000a    Bowling's research addressed these issues, starting with a research\u000a      monograph [1] submitted to the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry in 1999. This\u000a      examined the organisational culture and practices of policework, and set\u000a      out the theoretical basis for understanding institutional racism in\u000a      policing. The monograph was quoted during Inquiry hearings and cited in\u000a      the report as making an `important contribution' to the Inquiry's\u000a      understanding. Bowling subsequently co-authored the first significant\u000a      textbook on race and policing [2].\u000a    In 2007 Bowling published two key articles. The first co-authored article\u000a      [3], an innovative analysis of statistical data, demonstrated\u000a      decisively&#8212;for the first time in a peer-reviewed law journal&#8212;that the\u000a      disproportionate impact of stop and search on black and ethnic minority\u000a      communities amounted to direct and indirect discrimination. The second\u000a      article [4], an invited lecture to the prestigious Stockholm Criminology\u000a      Symposium in 2006, drew on theoretical and empirical research findings to\u000a      develop a process, captured by Bowling's concept of `good enough\u000a      policing', through which police and public could agree on standards of\u000a      fairness and effectiveness acceptable to both. This concept, coined by the\u000a      author, has subsequently been taken up and attributed to Bowling by other\u000a      academics (e.g. Mike Hough, `Procedural justice and professional policing\u000a      in times of austerity.' Criminology and Criminal Justice (2013 13\u000a      (2) 181-197)).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41246","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Professor Lewis's work has enriched and informed public policy and\u000a      political debate in UK legislatures, an influential commission, and the\u000a      campaign for the legalisation of assisted suicide in the UK. Her findings\u000a      have contributed to legal change on assisted dying in Canada and Australia\u000a      and to a judicial challenge to the current legal position in England and\u000a      Wales.\u000a    Enriching and informing debate\u000a    Professor Lewis's work identifying the features of legal regimes that\u000a      regulate assisted dying, evaluating the effectiveness of individual\u000a      safeguards, and examining the evidence for and against the slippery slope\u000a      argument has informed policy debate in the Scottish Parliament, through\u000a      her oral evidence and written briefings for the End of Life Assistance\u000a      (Scotland) Bill Committee [12]. The resulting report referred to Professor\u000a      Lewis's evidence on capacity and length of the physician\/patient\u000a      relationship [13]. Professor Lewis's work was also heavily cited and\u000a      quoted in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) Briefing\u000a      paper [14] provided to all members of the Scottish Parliament prior to the\u000a      final vote on the Bill in 2010, to which she also contributed in an\u000a      editorial capacity. In particular, her analysis of the slippery slope\u000a      argument in the Dutch context [6] was accepted in the SPICe briefing [14]\u000a      (at 18-19).\u000a    Outside the legislative context, but still influential in the public\u000a      policy debate, Professor Lewis's work informed her oral evidence to and\u000a      written briefings for CoAD in 2011 [2],[3],[8]. It was heavily cited in an\u000a      earlier 2010 Demos briefing paper prepared for CoAD [9] and in the 2012\u000a      CoAD Report [7]. Based directly on Professor Lewis's findings on\u000a      the effectiveness of legal safeguards [2], CoAD reached the key conclusion\u000a      that assisted suicide for the terminally ill could safely be legalised\u000a      with safeguards to protect the vulnerable [7] (citing [2] 34 times).\u000a    Professor Lewis's critique of the informal legal change produced by the\u000a      Director of Public Prosecutions' new guidance for prosecutors [4], [15]\u000a      has directly informed and shaped public and political debate, influencing\u000a      Parliamentarians, the campaign to legalise assisted suicide in the UK and\u000a      a judicial challenge to the current legal position. To trace the impact of\u000a      one key conclusion: Professor Lewis contends that factors in the Policy\u000a      `ensure that assistance in suicide remains an amateur activity\u000a      carried out by inexperienced individuals without the assistance of\u000a      professionals or amateur organisations (as in Switzerland)' and identifies\u000a      the risks associated with this approach ([4] at 129-130). The following\u000a      year, Patricia Hewitt MP stated in a Parliamentary debate [16]:\u000a    In the words of Professor Penney Lewis of the centre of medical law and\u000a      ethics at King's College, London, the guidelines `are designed to ensure\u000a      that assistance in suicide remains an amateur activity carried out\u000a      by inexperienced individuals without the assistance of professionals.\u000a    The amateur\/professional discussion recurred in Parliament in 2012\u000a      (Hansard HL HL Deb, 13\/2\/2012, c625, c629, c632 (Lord Joffe, Baroness\u000a      Young, Baroness Finlay)).The critique has also been used extensively by\u000a      Dignity in Dying (DiD) in its campaign for legal change and was cited in\u000a      its briefing\u000a      on the Final Policy (`assistance in suicide will remain an amateur\u000a        activity carried out by inexperienced individuals, with potentially\u000a      dangerous consequences for the person being assisted to attempt suicide,\u000a      and placing a terrible burden on those who assist them from compassionate\u000a      motives') and subsequent briefings, in its evidence\u000a        to CoAD (at 3) and in a recent paper\u000a        on a draft assisted dying bill (at 9). The discussion was reiterated\u000a      by Raymond Tallis, the Chair of Healthcare Professionals for Assisted\u000a      Dying, in media\u000a        interviews, a public\u000a        lecture and a press\u000a        release, and by Professor Lewis in interviews with BBC Newsnight,\u000a      the International Herald Tribune, the New\u000a          York Times, the Washington\u000a          Post and RIA\u000a          Novosti (Russia) [17]. Demos quoted extensively from the\u000a      critique in its briefing for CoAD [9] (at 6, 14, 15, 17,\u000a      and in its blog).\u000a      The 2012 CoAD Report concluded that `There is significant concern\u000a      that assisting suicide remains an amateur activity' [7] (at 23),\u000a      and included a lengthy quotation from Professor Lewis's evidence [7] (at\u000a      51). The CoAD conclusion was widely reported in national and international\u000a      press (see eg Independent;\u000a      New Law J 2012;162(7495); Cdn Med Assoc J 2012;184(2):E109-E112)\u000a      and challenged in the Church\u000a        of England's official response to CoAD's Report. Paul Bowen QC,\u000a      representing Tony Nicklinson (who was seeking to use the defence of\u000a      necessity to permit euthanasia), used Professor Lewis's argument in the\u000a      High Court, explaining why the status quo is unsatisfactory by relying on\u000a      `an assertion that the current policy of the [Director of Public\u000a      Prosecutions], by excluding professionals from assisting suicide,\u000a      encourages covert and amateur assisted suicides' (Nicklinson v Ministry\u000a        of Justice [2012] EWHC 304, [47]). Bowen also repeated this point to\u000a      the media in a widely\u000a        reported interview during the full hearing in June 2012. Professor\u000a      Lewis's comments to the Associated Press and the Press Association on\u000a      Nicklinson's death and the prospects for legal change following his\u000a      unsuccessful challenge were picked up in over 800 media outlets\u000a      internationally, and she was interviewed on Al Jazeera, ITN and BBC TV and\u000a      radio.\u000a    Legal change\u000a    Professor Lewis's work has contributed directly to legal change on\u000a      assisted dying. Her affidavit as an expert witness [10] (containing\u000a      [1],[2],[4] as exhibits) was influential in the 2012 decision of the\u000a      British Columbia Supreme Court (BCSC) to strike down the criminal\u000a      prohibition on assisted suicide as unconstitutional (suspended for one\u000a      year to allow the federal Parliament time to amend the Criminal Code) and\u000a      craft a `constitutional exemption' for Gloria Taylor, a seriously ill\u000a      plaintiff, allowing her to obtain lawful assistance in suicide. The\u000a      government was subsequently refused a stay of this constitutional\u000a      exemption by the BC Court of Appeal (Carter [2012] BCCA 336, [31],\u000a      [42]). Professor Lewis's evidence is cited 11 times in the BCSC judgment,\u000a      in particular, her research explaining the Dutch data on non-voluntary\u000a      euthanasia which rebut the slippery slope arguments central to the\u000a      Attorney General for Canada's unsuccessful case.\u000a    A bill to legalise a model of assisted dying is currently under\u000a      consideration in the Tasmanian Parliament. In an unsolicited email in\u000a      January 2013, Jessica Radford, the Deputy Chief of Staff to the Tasmanian\u000a      Premier wrote: `Research that you have undertaken and published has been\u000a      very important and informative in preparing the proposed model . . .'\u000a      Indeed [2] is cited over 50 times in the Consultation Paper [11], more\u000a      than any other single piece of research or body of research. The proposed\u000a      model reflects recommendations made in [2] on a number\u000a      of safeguards including a prospective voluntariness check (pp31, 47-48), a\u000a      palliative filter (p38), the presence of a health care professional at the\u000a      end of life (pp44-45) and consultation (p51).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Whether assisted dying should be legalised is often treated as an ethical\u000a      question transcending national boundaries and legal systems. Work in this\u000a      field is dominated by partisan exhortation by proponents or opponents of\u000a      legalisation. Professor Lewis's comparative research on legal change on\u000a      assisted dying highlights the central importance of the choice of legal\u000a      route in shaping regulatory regimes, evaluates the impact of legalisation\u000a      on non-voluntary euthanasia (the `slippery slope' argument) and assesses\u000a      the effectiveness of regulation in permissive jurisdictions. Her critique\u000a      of the unsatisfactory legal position in the UK coupled with expert\u000a      interventions, have shaped and informed policy debate, and directly\u000a      influenced the campaign to legalise assisted suicide and ongoing judicial\u000a      challenges to the current position.

Her\u000a      research (i) demonstrates the significance of the choice of a particular\u000a      route towards legalisation, including constitutional rights, defences\u000a      based on necessity or compassion, and legislative approaches, (ii)\u000a      assesses evidence for and against the slippery slope argument, and (iii)\u000a      assesses the effectiveness of different legal and regulatory regimes.\u000a    The significance of legal route\u000a    One of her most important conclusions is that regimes resulting from\u000a      necessity or compassion as mechanisms of legal change will include\u000a      termination of life without request where necessary to relieve suffering.\u000a      Applying the defence of necessity in cases of termination without request,\u000a      as in the Netherlands, is often seen as evidence of a slippery slope.\u000a      Professor Lewis has shown [1] that it is the grounding\u000a      in the doctor-centred duty-based defence of necessity (rather than the\u000a      patient's rights) which explains the Dutch legal acceptance of euthanasia\u000a      where necessary to relieve the suffering of an incompetent patient.\u000a    Evaluating slippery slope arguments\u000a    Professor Lewis's research [1], [4], [6] evaluates the impact of slippery\u000a      slope arguments in the context of different regimes. She concludes that\u000a      current evidence does not indicate either that legalisation causes an\u000a      increase in the rate of non-voluntary euthanasia (e.g. in the Netherlands\u000a      and Belgium) or that such rates are higher under a prohibitive approach:\u000a      in some prohibitive jurisdictions the rates of non-voluntary euthanasia\u000a      are higher than the Dutch rate, but lower in others. It also seems likely\u000a      that cultural factors may significantly influence baseline rates.\u000a    Regulatory regimes and evidence of their effectiveness\u000a    Evidence from jurisdictions that allow assisted dying provides important\u000a      information about how mechanisms work in practice. To interpret these data\u000a      meaningfully, however, it is essential to understand the context of\u000a      different legal frameworks. Professor Lewis's work includes: comparative\u000a      evaluation of regulation in the permissive jurisdictions of Netherlands,\u000a      Belgium, Oregon and Switzerland and the evidence for the effectiveness of\u000a      individual safeguards [2]; an examination of prospective vs retrospective\u000a      assessment proposing two-track regulation that gives greater weight to\u000a      prospective assessment than current English law coupled with strong\u000a      retrospective scrutiny [3]; and a critique of informal legal change in\u000a      England and Wales resulting from new guidance for prosecutors [4]. This\u000a      argues that a shift of focus away from the `victim', and desire to avoid\u000a      appearing to create a regulatory regime, open the door to assisted suicide\u000a      in cases which would not be permitted by most regimes, while exposing\u000a      helpers to the risk of prosecution.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41247","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Prof. Wintemute's research and detailed knowledge of comparative law\u000d\u000a      developments have allowed him to contribute to campaigns for legal change\u000d\u000a      and significantly influence the development of human rights law. In 1999,\u000d\u000a      he set out to find ways to participate in cases of discrimination against\u000d\u000a      same-sex couples or parents in international human rights courts, because\u000d\u000a      these cases can benefit many more countries than cases in national courts.\u000d\u000a      Judgments of the ECtHR apply to the 47 countries (with combined\u000d\u000a      populations of over 800 million people) that are parties to the EConHR.\u000d\u000a      Judgments of the IACtHR apply to the 23 countries (with combined\u000d\u000a      populations of over 550 million people) that are parties to the AConHR.\u000d\u000a      Favourable judgments of these courts could therefore benefit all lesbian\u000d\u000a      and gay individuals and same-sex couples and parents in these countries,\u000d\u000a      and their children.\u000d\u000a    Before 2000, there had been no \"third-party interventions\" in ECtHR cases\u000d\u000a      on sexual orientation discrimination. Seeing an opportunity to combine his\u000d\u000a      pre-PhD litigation experience at a New York law firm with his research at\u000d\u000a      King's, Wintemute contacted an NGO (ILGA-Europe, the European Region of\u000d\u000a      the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association)\u000d\u000a      about a potential third-party intervention. In so doing, he created an\u000d\u000a      academic-NGO partnership, which transformed ILGA-Europe's work, by opening\u000d\u000a      up a whole new field of activity, strategic litigation. Since 2000,\u000d\u000a      ILGA-Europe has been granted leave to submit 14 interventions to the\u000d\u000a      ECtHR, 9 of which Wintemute has drafted. In these 9 interventions (on\u000d\u000a      behalf of ILGA-Europe and 9 other NGOs, including the International\u000d\u000a      Federation for Human Rights or FIDH, and the International Commission of\u000d\u000a      Jurists), he has drawn on his research and expertise to advise the ECtHR\u000d\u000a      as to whether developments in comparative law support a finding of\u000d\u000a      discrimination violating the EConHR.\u000d\u000a    Since 1 Jan. 2008, these interventions have helped to persuade the ECtHR\u000d\u000a      to adopt crucial anti-discrimination principles in five cases, outlined\u000d\u000a      below. In cases (1)-(3) and (5), the only intervention supporting the\u000d\u000a      applicants was drafted by Wintemute, while in case (4), Amnesty\u000d\u000a      International's intervention stressed United Nations materials of limited\u000d\u000a      relevance to the case. In all five cases, the interventions contained much\u000d\u000a      more detailed comparative law research than the written arguments of the\u000d\u000a      applicants' lawyers. In case (4), only the intervention drafted by\u000d\u000a      Wintemute made the specific \"European consensus\" argument mentioned below.\u000d\u000a      All 5 judgments discussed below are extremely useful precedents, which\u000d\u000a      practising lawyers and NGOs around the world are citing when they seek\u000d\u000a      legal reforms from national legislatures and courts.

Austria (Chamber judgment of 24\u000d\u000a      June 2010): \"A cohabiting same-sex couple ... falls within the notion\u000d\u000a        of 'family life' [in Article 8]\" (judgment para. 92-94 for\u000d\u000a      reasoning; judgment paras. 5-6, 84 for references; cf. intervention paras.\u000d\u000a      4-13); and the right to marry in Article 12 could apply to a same-sex\u000d\u000a        couple in the future (judgment para. 61 for reasoning; judgment\u000d\u000a      paras. 5-6, 47-48 for references; cf. intervention paras. 14-27). This\u000d\u000a      overruled prior decisions by the ECtHR that same-sex couples did not enjoy\u000d\u000a      \"family life\" under Article 8 (Mata Estevez, 2001), and that\u000d\u000a      Article 12 \"secures the fundamental right [only] of a man and woman to\u000d\u000a      marry\" (Christine Goodwin, 2002). The \"family life\" statement was\u000d\u000a      cited by the IACtHR in Atala v.

A third aspect of Schalk is the\u000d\u000a      dissenting opinion (3 of 7 judges), which agreed with the intervention\u000d\u000a      that the absence of a legal framework for same-sex couples in Austria\u000d\u000a      (like the UK's Civil Partnership Act 2004) was discrimination violating\u000d\u000a      the EConHR (dissenting op. paras. 4-6, 9-10 for reasoning; judgment paras.\u000d\u000a      5-6, 85-86 for references; cf. intervention paras. 28-44).\u000d\u000a    (4) X &amp; Others v.

X &amp; Others made visible the\u000d\u000a      discrimination suffered by children of same-sex parents in most European\u000d\u000a      countries, which do not permit a child to have two legal parents of the\u000d\u000a      same sex. It will require changes to the laws of 7 European countries\u000d\u000a      (unless they abolish adoption by unmarried couples), and could inspire\u000d\u000a      changes in others.\u000d\u000a    (5) Vallianatos v.

He was asked to provide a report on international law with\u000d\u000a      regard to sexual orientation discrimination, with emphasis on the EConHR,\u000d\u000a      because a critical question for the IACtHR was how the ECtHR would handle\u000d\u000a      a similar case. Wintemute's evidence on this specific question helped to\u000d\u000a      persuade the IACtHR to conclude:\u000d\u000a    (6) Atala v.

Atala\u000d\u000a      lays the foundation for future IACtHR case law regarding sexual\u000d\u000a      orientation discrimination in the criminal law, in access to employment,\u000d\u000a      or in relation to the rights of same-sex couples, as well as with regard\u000d\u000a      to parental rights other than custody (including access to adoption).\u000d\u000a    Prof. Wintemute speaks frequently at conferences, seminars and NGO\u000d\u000a      training sessions about the potential applications of these judgments (eg,\u000d\u000a      Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile, 8 Nov. 2012; Ministry\u000d\u000a      of Foreign Affairs, Tallinn, Estonia, 23 Sept. 2013; Bandhu Social Welfare\u000d\u000a      Society, Dhaka, Bangladesh, 9 Nov. 2013; all funded by the local British\u000d\u000a      Embassy or High Commission).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Prof. Robert Wintemute has presented his comparative law research on\u000d\u000a      sexual orientation discrimination to the European Court of Human Rights or\u000d\u000a      ECtHR (through written and oral arguments on behalf of intervening\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisations or NGOs), and the Inter-American Court of\u000d\u000a      Human Rights or IACtHR (through oral and written evidence as an expert\u000d\u000a      witness).

In this field, which barely existed in 1993, he has\u000d\u000a      become one of the leading academic lawyers in the world.\u000d\u000a    In early 1993, the legal situation for same-sex couples and parents in\u000d\u000a      Europe, the USA and Canada was grim. There were no favourable decisions\u000d\u000a      from the ECtHR, the EU's Court of Justice, the UK's House of Lords, the\u000d\u000a      IACtHR, or the US or Canadian Supreme Courts. Same-sex couples could\u000d\u000a      register their relationships in Denmark, but nowhere else in the world.\u000d\u000a      Allowing a same-sex couple to marry was legally and politically\u000d\u000a      unthinkable, and there were no laws (in force) or appellate court\u000d\u000a      decisions authorising joint adoption of children. Discrimination against\u000d\u000a      same-sex couples and parents was largely seen as legal and unproblematic.\u000d\u000a    Through his research, Wintemute challenged this hostile status quo. By\u000d\u000a      analysing trends in international human rights law, EU law, and national\u000d\u000a      constitutional, criminal and family law, together with other data\u000d\u000a      (including resolutions of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly\u000d\u000a      and the EU's European Parliament), he has developed a conceptual framework\u000d\u000a      for analysing discrimination based on sexual orientation. This provides\u000d\u000a      arguments for interpreting international human rights treaties and\u000d\u000a      national constitutions as requiring differences in treatment based on\u000d\u000a      sexual orientation to be treated as \"suspect\" (prohibited discrimination\u000d\u000a      unless the government can establish a strong justification for them), in\u000d\u000a      the same way as differences in treatment based on race, religion or sex.\u000d\u000a      The underlying rationale is that an individual's sexual orientation is\u000d\u000a      difficult to change, or should not have to be changed, like their race,\u000d\u000a      religion or sex. He has also perfected an analysis of sexual orientation\u000d\u000a      discrimination as also constituting sex discrimination, and therefore\u000d\u000a      prohibited by existing law. Wintemute has demonstrated that, whether a\u000d\u000a      \"sexual orientation\" or \"sex\" approach is adopted, it would be extremely\u000d\u000a      difficult to justify denying same-sex couples the rights of different-sex\u000d\u000a      couples (including access to marriage), or excluding lesbian and gay\u000d\u000a      individuals and same-sex couples from access to parental rights, including\u000d\u000a      custody of their genetic children, adoption of children, and use of donor\u000d\u000a      insemination or surrogacy.\u000d\u000a    His research outputs include books published in 1995 [1] and 2001 [2],\u000d\u000a      both viewed as key texts, and several articles [3, 4, 5].

This\u000a      has resulted particularly from its influence on the policies and\u000a      activities of the Global Land Tool Network and UN-Habitat, and its use as\u000a      the basis for developing and implementing training tools and material used\u000a      by policymakers and practitioners around the world. It has also been used\u000a      to develop important new land laws; most recently, it has underpinned the\u000a      production of an entirely new Interim Legal Framework for the Benadir\u000a      region of Somalia. Through mainstream platforms such as the World Urban\u000a      Forum organised by the UN, the research has helped lead to new thinking\u000a      and synergies on innovative, pro-poor and gendered land and property\u000a      rights in the Muslim world.\u000a    Contributions to the development of GLTN policy: GLTN is the\u000a      world's leading pro-poor land and property rights network; its 60 global\u000a      partners include the World Bank, UN agencies, professional associations\u000a      and civil society networks (www.gltn.net).\u000a      UEL was a founder member of the Network when it was set up in 2006, and\u000a      led its International Advisory Board for research and training\u000a      institutions between 2006 and 2012. Recognising the gap in understanding\u000a      of Islamic dimensions of land in Muslim countries, in 2007 the GLTN\u000a      peer-reviewed and subsequently adopted the research underpinning and later\u000a      published in LLI [1] as the baseline for its `Islamic Mechanism'\u000a      cross-cutting theme. That Mechanism has since allowed the Network and its\u000a      members to adopt an Islamic lens as appropriate within a legal pluralist\u000a      approach.\u000a    The influence of the research is evident in the inclusion of the Islamic\u000a      Mechanism in key GLTN policy documents, including Handling Land:\u000a        Innovative tools for land governance and secure tenure [a], which\u000a      had been downloaded from the GLTN website more than 350 times as of 31\u000a      July 2013. That document likewise reflects the influence of UEL research\u000a      on the development of the GLTN's `gender' and `youth' themes. The insights\u000a      published in LLI are also highlighted prominently in the influential\u000a      report UN State of the Arab Cities Report 2012 [b, p.103].\u000a    Contributions to UN-Habitat policy: On the basis of his research &#8212;\u000a      and subsequent expertise &#8212; in Islamic dimensions, Sait has made invited\u000a      contributions to policy discussion and formulation within various\u000a      UN-Habitat forums. These have included his role as chair of the Evaluation\u000a      Panel of UN-Habitat Iraq operations (2011), and membership (since 2012) of\u000a      its Executive Director's Advisory Group on Gender Issues [c]. He also sits\u000a      on its Institutional Reform Panel (2011) and an ad hoc review panel for\u000a      projects relating to land law in Muslim countries including Somalia, Iran,\u000a      Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Syria.\u000a    One of the most significant contributions made by the research to\u000a      UN-Habitat policy has been its influence on the development of the Gender\u000a      Evaluation Criteria (GEC) framework, a set of 22 evaluation questions used\u000a      to assess, and where necessary improve, the gender responsiveness of\u000a      large-scale land tools. The GEC was developed jointly between 2008 and\u000a      2009 through consultation meetings and e-forums involving the UN-Habitat,\u000a      the International Federation of Surveyors (FIG), the Huairou Commission\u000a      and UEL. Sait (who was seconded to the GLTN as its Gender Officer in\u000a      2005-06) particularly influenced the incorporation into the GEC of the\u000a      cross-cultural perspective characteristics of the research described\u000a      above. According to the Human Settlements Officer of UN-Habitat's Somali\u000a      Programme, Sait's research contributions were \"vital in the\u000a      operationalizing of the Gender Evaluation Criteria...[his] gender and\u000a      Islamic research contributing to its pioneering cross-cultural\u000a      methodology\" [d]. He also co-authored the GEC implementation guide, which\u000a      was published in its most recent format in 2011 [e]. This guide, which is\u000a      the GLTN's primary gender tool, is now being rolled out to support\u000a      assessment of the gender responsiveness of programmes and institutions in\u000a      dozens of countries.\u000a    An earlier version of the guide co-authored by Sait is credited with\u000a      helping 55,000 residents achieve secure land tenure in the informal\u000a      settlement of Ponte do Maduro, Recife (Brazil) in 2010. The Brazilian\u000a      government, which had planned to evict all 55,000 from their homes,\u000a      announced at a GLTN roundtable meeting at the 2010 World Urban Forum that\u000a      they would instead regularize the area, granting ownership of the occupied\u000a      land to more than 8,000 low-income families. Implementing the Gender\u000a      Evaluation Criteria enhanced the capacity of the local community in Ponte\u000a      do Maduro to lobby the government to reach this decision [f].\u000a    Capacity development and training to support land and property rights\u000a        and gender equality: In 2007, LLI was converted by Sait and Lim into\u000a      a 250-page training package on land issues in the Muslim world [g]. A\u000a      series of three training events using this training package were held in\u000a      Nairobi for UN-Habitat staff (April 2009), GLTN partners (November 2009),\u000a      and government officials from 20 Muslim countries attending the UN-Habitat\u000a      Governing Council (April 2011), where it was further endorsed at a GLTN\u000a      side-event [g]. Since 2008, the training has been delivered to a total of\u000a      some 200 government representatives, professionals and civil society\u000a      representatives from dozens of Muslim countries. Training programmes, each\u000a      of which typically involves 25-30 high-level government, professional and\u000a      civil society participants, have included country training focussed\u000a      specifically on Asia (event held in Kuala Lumpur, 2009), Africa (Nairobi,\u000a      April 2011), Gulf and Arab countries (Kuwait May 2012), and North Africa\u000a      and the Middle East (Cairo, May 2013) [d, h]. The training package has\u000a      also been adopted for roll out in Iran [a, p. 89], and Sait has recently\u000a      been invited to Tehran to provide technical support during the First\u000a      Global Assembly of Islamic Cities in September 2013. Some of these events\u000a      &#8212; including that in Cairo &#8212; have combined training in Islamic law with GEC\u000a      gender rights training to particularly support the improvement of women's\u000a      rights in Muslim countries. Sait has also contributed to World Bank land\u000a      strategies through presentations made there in 2008 and 2012, and through\u000a      his use of the research to evaluate project proposals on development\u000a      issues in the Muslim world [i].\u000a    Development of the Benadir Interim Legal Framework: Somalia's\u000a      decades-long lack of a proper legal framework has had serious consequences\u000a      for the country's political and social stability. Previous attempts to\u000a      develop laws typically failed because of the difficulty of ensuring their\u000a      compatibility with Islamic law. From April 2013, LLI [1] has made a direct\u000a      and crucial contribution to the development of an interim legal framework\u000a      by the Regional Administration of Benadir, Somalia's principal region and\u000a      location of the national capital Mogadishu [k]. In April 2013, Somali\u000a      officials approached Sait through the UN to request that he provide\u000a      technical advice in and oversee the drafting and validation of that\u000a      interim framework. Sait subsequently provided extensive legal advice, much\u000a      of it drawing very heavily on the methodology used and insights published\u000a      in LLI [1].\u000a    The Human Settlements Officer of UN-Habitat's Somali Programme\u000a      acknowledges the direct and significant impacts of Sait's work on the\u000a      development of the Legal Framework for Somalia's Benadir Region: as well\u000a      as overseeing \"the difficult drafting process of the interim legal\u000a      framework...[Sait] visited Mogadishu and chaired the validation process\u000a      effectively, which led to the adoption of [the] legal framework in\u000a      September 2013\" [d]. The nature and impact of Sait's contribution &#8212; and\u000a      specifically of the use made of LLI [1] - is further acknowledged by the\u000a      Governor of Benadir Region Administration (and Mayor of Mogadishu). The\u000a      \"main reason\" for approaching Sait was, he says \"his book, Land, Law and\u000a      Islam...which we consulted at our meetings\". Highlighting the significance\u000a      of that contribution, he continues: \"I am very grateful to [the]\u000a      University of East London and Mr Siraj for his expertise and diplomacy,\u000a      which is the main reason why the Interim Legal Framework was adopted\" [j].\u000a      He also emphasises the significance of that legal framework, not just to\u000a      the Benadir Region, but to Somalia more broadly, describing it as: \"one of\u000a      the most important achievements of my career and partnership with\u000a      UN-Habitat. It serves as a model for other regions in my country, and also\u000a      other States\" [j].\u000a    The five framework regulations on land and human rights, governance,\u000a      business and investment, urban services and building regulations were\u000a      promulgated on 30 September 2013. The contributions made by Sait and the\u000a      use made of LLI [1] in the development of the Bendair Legal Framework are\u000a      acknowledged explicitly in that document [k]. UEL's contribution here\u000a      represents a continuation of engagement in Somalia since 2007, when Sait\u000a      and Lim provided technical advice on land tenure reform to the country's\u000a      Federal Government. Somali officials also participated in the Islamic law\u000a      training event in Nairobi (April 2011), and Sait contributed to Articles\u000a      43-48 of the draft Somali Constitution 2012 (Chapter 3), which deal with\u000a      land, property and environment.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research conducted at UEL has been instrumental in efforts to strengthen\u000a      land and property rights and gender equality in Muslim countries. These\u000a      impacts arise particularly from its influence on the incorporation by the\u000a      Global Land Tool Network (GLTN) of a much stronger emphasis on Islamic\u000a      issues in the implementation of land tools.

That diversity is\u000a      in some ways particularly pronounced in Muslim societies, which now\u000a      account for nearly a quarter of the world's population. However, research\u000a      on distinctively Islamic strategies and processes for regulating and\u000a      protecting land, property and housing rights is scarce, and global reviews\u000a      of land tenure rarely take these distinctive Islamic land laws\u000a      sufficiently into account.\u000a    Since 2004, Siraj Sait (Reader at UEL since 1999 excepting secondment to\u000a      UN-Habitat, 2005-6) and Hilary Lim (Principal Lecturer; joined UEL 1994)\u000a      have sought to redress this gap through the development of new knowledge,\u000a      professional methodologies and networks in the complex area of Islamic\u000a      land and property rights. Their research, which approaches these topics\u000a      from a human rights and gender equality perspective and within a legal\u000a      pluralism framework, has been supported and widely used by UN-Habitat, the\u000a      agency dealing with global human settlements. That research includes\u000a      examinations of Islamic land tools such as religious endowment (waqf)\u000a      administration, and waste land reclamation process (mewat) [1, 3,\u000a      4]. It also addresses women's equal rights to property through\u000a      investigations of various under-researched fields such as joint marital\u000a      property [5] and matrilineal practices [6] in Muslim communities.\u000a    The research underpinning the impacts described here has its origins in a\u000a      series of research papers on `Islam, Land and Property', produced by UEL\u000a      for the UN-Habitat training and website in 2005. Sait and Lim developed\u000a      this series into the book Land, Law and Islam: Property and Human\u000a        Rights in the Muslim World [1; hereafter LLI], which was\u000a      subsequently translated into Arabic. The book provides a comprehensive\u000a      exploration of Islamic development frameworks, law and human rights,\u000a      tenure models, inheritance, finance, endowment, and Muslim women's rights.\u000a    This focus on equal property and land rights among Muslim women was\u000a      addressed further in Sait and Lim's 2007 publication `Accidental Islamic\u000a      Feminism' [2]. Here, they set out a pioneering `compensatory' gender\u000a      equality approach, including various interlinked property flow systems\u000a      compensating for the lower inheritance shares typically afforded to Muslim\u000a      women. The novel, dialogic methodology adopted here drew on comparative\u000a      interdisciplinary studies and rights-based approaches within Muslim\u000a      discourses to develop authentic, context-specific Islamic interpretations\u000a      of universal development goals. Sait applied the same methodology to\u000a      further research on women's equal property rights, funded by UN-Habitat\u000a      and published in 2013 [5, 6]; to an African land law project funded by the\u000a      World Bank [3]; and to research on post-conflict situations supported by\u000a      the United Nations Environment Program, USAID and others [4].\u000a    Sait's research has drawn on comparative perspectives and best practice\u000a      examples from dozens of country studies conducted at UEL, including of\u000a      Afghanistan, Indonesia, Iraq, Somalia [3], Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania,\u000a      Senegal [4], Algeria, Burkina Faso, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Malaysia,\u000a      Morocco, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Turkey [5, 6]. The research employs a\u000a      tool-based approach developed by the GLTN, wherein principles and theories\u000a      are applied practically to solve problems in land administration and\u000a      management. The work was further both influenced by and influential in the\u000a      development of the `Islamic Mechanism', `gender' and `youth' as\u000a      cross-cutting issues that GLTN members have agreed to address in dealing\u000a      with land and property issues at country level.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42008","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"587116","Name":"Azerbaijan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Contributions to discussion, debate and policy formulation relating to\u000a      counter-terrorism:\u000a      The influence of Silke's research has been realised particularly through\u000a      his membership of and contribution to numerous expert panels and policy\u000a      committees, including the British Psychological Society's working group on\u000a      the Psychological Risk Assessment of those Convicted or Detained under\u000a      Terrorist Related Offences from 2007 - 2011. In 2009, he was appointed a\u000a      Specialist Advisor to the House of Commons Communities and Local\u000a      Government Committee for its inquiry into the UK Government's programme\u000a      for preventing violent extremism, in which role he provided an invited\u000a      briefing on understanding radicalisation to the Committee at the start of\u000a      its enquiry at the House of Commons, 14 July 2009 [a].\u000a    Major research findings, including about the implications of contemporary\u000a      discourses of radicalisation and extremism for the remit and parameters of\u000a      counter-terrorism policymaking [4], have also been shared with\u000a      policy-makers via their invited presentation in local and national policy\u000a      forums. These have included briefings provided to the Home Office\u000a      (Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism leadership programme: Silke,\u000a      July 2009; and Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, Home Office:\u000a      Richards, February, 2013); Foreign and Commonwealth Office\u000a      (Richards, July 2010); and local `Prevent' coordinators in Newham\u000a      and Birmingham (Richards, July 2012 and June 2010 respectively). Richards'\u000a      paper on radicalisation and `Prevent' [3] was presented in Birmingham as\u000a      part of a one-day conference (`Unravelling Extremisms: Informing the\u000a      Debate') to enhance the local authority's understanding of radicalisation\u000a      and `extremisms'. Attendees, who numbered around 100 in total, included\u000a      local authority employees, those involved in the delivery of `Prevent'\u000a      (including private contractors), and local police representatives.\u000a    Contributions to international policy formulation. Contributions\u000a      have also been made to international policy discussion through Silke's\u000a      presentation of research findings to a Pakistan delegation,\u000a      Foreign and Commonwealth Office (London, 11 February 2011); and to Senior\u000a        Government Officials from Azerbaijan (Foreign and Commonwealth\u000a      Office, London, 16 June 2009). In some cases, those findings have informed\u000a      significant shifts in international policy formulation. On 22 November\u000a      2010, Silke used expertise gained through the underpinning research on the\u000a      psychology of counter-terrorism to provide invited oral testimony (via\u000a      video link) to the Canadian Special Senate Committee on Anti-terrorism\u000a      (CSSC), a body created in May 2010 to undertake a \"comprehensive review of\u000a      the provisions and operation of the Anti-terrorism Act and to study\u000a      legislation related to anti-terrorism\". Silke drew on findings published\u000a      in [1] and [2] to advise the Committee on radicalisation,\u000a      de-radicalisation and counter-terrorism; this testimony informed the\u000a      development by the Committee of its 2011 report Security, Freedom and\u000a        the Complex Terrorist Threat: Positive Steps Ahead. That report\u000a      draws strongly on advice provided by Silke in recommending the provision\u000a      of federal government support for further research into \"the transition\u000a      from radicalization into violence in Canada...in order to better\u000a      understand and prevent violent extremism.\" It acknowledges Silke as an\u000a      expert witness, and cites his support for its recommendation that Canada\u000a      should make use of its existing justice system for criminal offences in\u000a      responding to the threat of terrorism [b]. Since the debate was judged to\u000a      be in the public interest Silke's testimony was, moreover, broadcast live\u000a      on the internet and recorded for later broadcast on television in Canada;\u000a      a transcription of his testimony was also made available online [c]. As\u000a      such, his expertise in this area contributed, not just to specialist\u000a      policy discussion and debate, but also to broader public awareness of\u000a      important issues relating to the research.\u000a    Improving understanding and developing new tools for counter-terrorist\u000a        professionals.\u000a      Prison staff: In 2009, Silke drew on research conducted as part of\u000a      the NOMS study [2] to give invited presentations at two national\u000a      conferences organised by the Ministry of Justice. Those presentations\u000a      focussed on key findings relating to the management and reform of\u000a      terrorist prisoners, around 130 of whom are currently incarcerated in\u000a      prisons in England &amp; Wales. These led to further invitations to share\u000a      those findings more widely &#8212; and thereby improve understanding of\u000a      prisoners convicted of terrorism-related offences - through guest lectures\u000a      for a combined total of more than 250 staff working with such prisoners at\u000a      UK prisons including: HMP Full Sutton (13 October 2009), HMP Frankland (27\u000a      April 2010), and HMP Feltham (29 March 2011). Silke has also used his\u000a      research to enhance understanding of terrorist psychology among\u000a      representatives of policing and security bodies, including the Territorial\u000a      Policing CT Showcase 2008 (31 July 2008), Olympic Security Directorate (30\u000a      June 2009), and Metropolitan Police (13 January 2010).\u000a    That research has further supported the development of new risk\u000a        assessment tools for use in evaluating terrorist and extremist\u000a      offenders. In 2008, Silke applied his expertise in terrorist psychology,\u000a      terrorists in prison and terrorist disengagement as a member of an\u000a      advisory group of experts on psychological risk assessment, set up to\u000a      inform the development by the NOMS Operational Intervention Services Group\u000a      of the Extremism Risk Guidance (ERG22+). This new risk assessment\u000a      tool, which was launched in 2011, particularly followed the group's\u000a      recommendation for a structured risk guidance approach specifically\u000a      designed for use with terrorist prisoners [d]. Prior to its development,\u000a      prison authorities had no risk assessment tool validated for use with such\u000a      prisoners. Between 2011 and the end of 2012, the new tool had been used to\u000a      improve the ability of prison psychologists and offender managers to\u000a      conduct risk assessments of more than 80 terrorist and extremist prisoners\u000a      in England and Wales; it is expected that assessments of the remaining\u000a      40-45 prisoners will be made by the end of 2013 [e]. The ERG is now\u000a      regarded as the primary risk assessment tool for such prisoners in England\u000a      and Wales; a modified version has been adapted by the Police, who use it\u000a      in community settings to divert potential extremists from pathways to\u000a      terrorist activity [e]. Silke's research also helped inform the\u000a      development of VERA-2 [f], the only other risk assessment tool\u000a      available for use with terrorist and extremist prisoners, which is used\u000a      widely in prisons in Australia and Canada. Finally, in 2012, precisely in\u000a      line with the recommendations made in [2], the National Offender\u000a      Management Service introduced its Healthy Identities Intervention\u000a        programme to support extremist prisoners' disengagement from\u000a      extremism. The programme is now available to all terrorism- and extremism-\u000a      related prisoners in England and Wales.\u000a    Military personnel: Invited talks have also been delivered to\u000a      improve understanding among UK and international military professionals,\u000a      including through addresses to the Advanced Command and Staff Course of\u000a      the UK Defence Academy (28 March 2011); and Higher Command and Staff\u000a      Course, Joint Services Command, and Staff College, Defence Academy\u000a      (Swindon, 23 January 2009). Between 2010 and 2011 Morrison was the project\u000a      manager on the government-funded Violent Dissident Republicanism project,\u000a      in which role he gave regular private briefings to both the Police Service\u000a      of Northern Ireland and the British Security Services. Silke has\u000a      contributed to a Senior Command and Staff Course of The Military College,\u000a      Irish Defence Forces, (Ireland, 18 January 2010). Further afield, Morrison\u000a      was invited in 2012 to present his findings on radicalisation within\u000a      prisons at a NATO Advanced Research Workshop in Ankara at the NATO Centre\u000a      of Excellence-Defence Against Terrorism (COE-DAT). Attendants included\u000a      approximately 25 senior military personnel from North Africa and\u000a      South-Eastern Europe who are currently involved in NATO's Mediterranean\u000a      Dialogue [g]. As a result of his participation in this event, Morrison was\u000a      commissioned in November 2012 to help develop a programme to assist the\u000a      Nigerian government in countering Boko Haram: a 5-day workshop was\u000a      subsequently delivered in 13-17 May 2013 [h].\u000a    Enhanced public awareness of and engagement with important social and\u000a        political issues.\u000a      As well as informing policy discussion and formulation and supporting\u000a      improvements in practice, the research has fed into public debates on\u000a      issues relating to terrorism and counter-terrorism. Silke's research has\u000a      been covered extensively in both national and international media outlets,\u000a      allowing him to inform media discourse, share key findings with a wide\u000a      non-academic audience and thereby increase public awareness of and\u000a      engagement with significant social and political issues and events\u000a      relating to terrorism. To that end, he has appeared on over 100 national\u000a      and international media programmes since 2008, including news and current\u000a      affairs programmes for the BBC, Sky News, CNN, ITV and Channel 4. He has\u000a      also been interviewed regularly on radio and in printed press outlets with\u000a      very large readerships, including The Guardian, The\u000a        Independent, The Daily Telegraph, The Observer, Newsweek,\u000a      Time magazine, and La Republica. His work on terrorist\u000a      psychology and critical incident psychology has also been the focus of a\u000a      number of television documentaries, including the BBC Horizon episode \"How\u000a      to Survive a Disaster\" first broadcast on 10 Mar 2009 on BBC 2 to 1.7\u000a      million viewers [i]. More recently, Morrison has also made a significant\u000a      contribution to national and international media-led debates on terrorism:\u000a      in the aftermath of the Boston bombings he was commissioned to write\u000a      analysis for both the Irish Post and City AM, whilst a piece on cnn.com,\u000a      analysing the threat posed by dissident Irish Republicans to the G8\u000a      summit, made a significant contribution to international media and public\u000a      discussion of that event.

Andrew Silke (Professor of Criminology\u000a      at UEL since 2005) has led UEL research responding to this by exploring\u000a      processes of radicalisation, de-radicalisation and disengagement with\u000a      violent extremism. The work, which particularly examines psychological\u000a      facets of terrorism [1, 2, 5, 6], has yielded pioneering insights into\u000a      these processes, originating partly from its rejection of approaches to\u000a      radicalisation based on personality traits and mental illness, and of\u000a      models based on de-radicalisation theories. Instead, it emphasises the\u000a      critical roles of social psychological processes and suggests that\u000a      disengagement is an unexceptional &#8212; and even inevitable &#8212; process for most\u000a      terrorists.\u000a    These insights stem particularly from two research studies commissioned\u000a      in 2006 by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), and in 2007 by the National\u000a      Offender Management Service (NOMS). The MoD study involved a comprehensive\u000a      review of then-current understanding of the theories and models of\u000a      terrorist disengagement. Key research findings included the insights that\u000a      disengagement is usually catalysed by a complex set of factors, including\u000a      declining interaction with peers who support involvement in terrorism and\u000a      creation, instead, of new relationships supporting a life away from the\u000a      terrorist group. Isolation from terrorist peers is therefore a vital\u000a      factor in facilitating disengagement, a finding with important\u000a      implications for terrorist imprisonment policies. The research also\u000a      elucidated the role in the disengagement process of `turning point'\u000a      events, which provide subjects whose commitment to terrorism might\u000a      previously have been weakening with a clear justification for leaving [2].\u000a      Building on this work, the NOMS study assessed current prison- based\u000a      interventions for terrorist offenders and examined the evidence for\u000a      developing new interventions aimed at disengagement in the area of violent\u000a      extremism. This study illustrated both the importance of offering\u000a      extremist prisoners programmes to provide a route out of extremism whilst\u000a      they were incarcerated, and the lack of such programme for prisoners in\u000a      England and Wales, recommending strongly that this should be addressed\u000a      [2]. The work also incorporated an assessment of foreign programmes based\u000a      on religious de-radicalisation; it challenged the claims of success\u000a      attributed to these programmes, highlighting their unlikely efficacy for\u000a      hard-core members of terrorist movements. The research concluded that a\u000a      prison-based programme was required in England and Wales, but that this\u000a      did not have to have a religious foundation to be effective.\u000a    Further contributions to this body of research have come from Dr John\u000a      Morrison, who joined UEL as Senior Lecturer in Criminology and Criminal\u000a      Justice in 2011. Morrison and Silke's work, which is based on extensive\u000a      interviews with convicted terrorists, as well as analyses of published\u000a      documentation, has illuminated the role of ordinary psychological\u000a      processes and small group dynamics to understanding radicalisation [1, 5].\u000a      More specifically, it has shown that involvement is usually a gradual\u000a      process, wherein identity issues and social networks are important\u000a      factors. Contrary to expectations, the research also demonstrated that\u000a      eventual disengagement is normal for most terrorists and that recidivism\u000a      is remarkably low [2]. Crucially, however, it highlights distinctions\u000a      between disengagement and de-radicalisation, arguing for a more\u000a      sophisticated understanding of how involvement in terrorism ends [2, 5,\u000a      6].\u000a    A final strand of the research underpinning impacts described here has\u000a      been produced by Dr Anthony Richards (UEL 2007-), whose work on the\u000a      conceptualisation of terrorism, radicalisation and extremism [3, 4] has\u000a      particularly assessed the impact of discourses of `radicalisation' and\u000a      `extremism' on the widening remit and parameters of UK counter-terrorism.\u000a      The results of his work on this, and on the remit of the `Prevent' strand\u000a      of the British government's counter-terrorism strategy, have been\u000a      delivered in briefings to, and meetings with, policymakers and\u000a      practitioners at both national (Home Office, Foreign Office) and local\u000a      level (Birmingham, Newham).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42107","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    An assessment of the impact of his research involves three aspects &#8212;\u000d\u000a      impact in relation to current practice and procedures, reform of the law,\u000d\u000a      and international developments. The impact has been in relation to\u000d\u000a      defining the debate; changing attitudes; developing policies practices and\u000d\u000a      procedures; and reforming the law.\u000d\u000a    The impact of his research is partly based in Wales, but extends beyond\u000d\u000a      including to the other nations of the UK and the international community.\u000d\u000a      Within Wales, there is a strong movement in favour of reform.

His contributions are referred to\u000d\u000a        in the report and in particular his draft statutory principles and\u000d\u000a        definition of well-being are incorporated as part of the specific\u000d\u000a        recommendations (5.e).

Williams was the only academic member of the group. Its\u000d\u000a        deliberations formed the basis of the report to the General Assembly\u000d\u000a        Open Ended Working Group set up to strengthen the protection of human\u000d\u000a        rights of older people. The expert panel considered, inter alia, the\u000d\u000a        international aspects of elder abuse and access to justice. Professor\u000d\u000a        Williams presented papers to the group on each of these subjects. His\u000d\u000a        contributions were included in the final report to the Open Ended\u000d\u000a        Working Group.\u000d\u000a      In recognition of his expertise, Professor Williams was appointed as a\u000d\u000a        Trustee of Help the Aged and, following its merger with Age Concern, is\u000d\u000a        now a trustee of Age UK and Age Scotland. As a trustee, he actively\u000d\u000a        contributes to the development. As a trustee of Help the Aged, Williams\u000d\u000a        played a key role in the merger between it and Age Concern. He was a\u000d\u000a        member of small joint panel charged with the task of bringing the two\u000d\u000a        organisations together. As well as the complex mechanics of the merger,\u000d\u000a        he provided significant input into the identification of the mission of\u000d\u000a        the new charity, namely to eradicate ageism and to promotion of the\u000d\u000a        rights of older people. Age UK is recognised as being the voice\u000d\u000a        of older people (5.b).\u000d\u000a      In addition to his papers at academic conferences, Professor Williams\u000d\u000a        has spoken at many professional and practitioner conferences on the law\u000d\u000a        and the human rights of older people including presentations to many\u000d\u000a        voluntary organisation and others campaigning against elder abuse (for\u000d\u000a        example, the Royal College of Nursing Cymru, and the Dignified\u000d\u000a        Revolution). Other non-academic presentations include political party\u000d\u000a        fringe events, Speaking up for Age Conferences, the British\u000d\u000a        Psychological Society, Age Cymru, the International Academy of Law and\u000d\u000a        Mental Health, the Older People and Ageing Network, and the\u000d\u000a        International Congress of Psychology and Law. These contributions have\u000d\u000a        raised awareness of older people's rights within different professions\u000d\u000a        and at a political level, as well as the third sector. Following\u000d\u000a        publication of its Working Paper on Social Care Law, Professor Williams\u000d\u000a        participated in a Law Commission consultation conference in\u000d\u000a        Cardiff(5.g). He presented a paper before members of the Commission and\u000d\u000a        consultees, on the case for reforming the law on elder abuse and the\u000d\u000a        possibility of doing this on a Wales only basis. Whereas the Law\u000d\u000a        Commission's Working Paper advocated a combined England and Wales\u000d\u000a        approach, the final Report recognised the possibility of a Wales only\u000d\u000a        approach, particularly since the National Assembly acquired primary law\u000d\u000a        making power.\u000d\u000a      The impact on practitioners and professionals has been achieved through\u000d\u000a        informing them of the legal framework and shaping policy. As his\u000d\u000a        research with Clarke and Wydall demonstrates, current criminal and civil\u000d\u000a        justice seeking options are underused mainly because practitioners are\u000d\u000a        unaware of what is available. The impact of his research is evidenced by\u000d\u000a        the Protection of Older People in Wales: A guide to the law -\u000d\u000a        Professor Williams was invited by the Older People's Commissioner (as\u000d\u000a        part of her legal duty to raise awareness amongst practitioners of the\u000d\u000a        law and older people in Wales), to write this Guide (5.a). It is written\u000d\u000a        in accessible language, available online (5.d) and in hard copy and\u000d\u000a        provides a definitive guide for the social care, health and voluntary\u000d\u000a        sector workforce. It features on the websites of many organisations\u000d\u000a        including the Welsh Local Government Association (5.h) and the NHS Wales\u000d\u000a        website (5.i). It is widely used in social care, health, voluntary\u000d\u000a        sector and by disability and other third sector groups. It provides\u000d\u000a        advice for practitioners on the existing legal framework to protect\u000d\u000a        older people. The key purpose of the Guidance is to ensure that law is\u000d\u000a        used, and that it is use effectively by practitioners to improve the\u000d\u000a        lives of older people experiencing abuse &#8212; the welfareist response to\u000d\u000a        abuse is not, on its own, sufficient and may deny older people access to\u000d\u000a        justice. For practitioners, the Guidance provides essential information\u000d\u000a        on the range of options available. For those experiencing abuse, it is\u000d\u000a        empowering and assists them to make informed decisions. The\u000d\u000a        International Federation on Ageing has identified the Guide as evidence\u000d\u000a        of good practice for other jurisdictions both in the United Kingdom and\u000d\u000a        beyond. The Minister for Social Services in the Welsh Government has\u000d\u000a        commended it.\u000d\u000a      A recent initiative by the Welsh Government is to introduce a\u000d\u000a        Declaration of Rights of Older People. The Older People's Commissioner\u000d\u000a        was given the responsibility for drafting this declaration. Professor\u000d\u000a        Williams was one of the co-authors of the declaration (5.a). Although it\u000d\u000a        will not have legal effect, the Government's intention is that the\u000d\u000a        principles should be embedded in the culture of the public sector\u000d\u000a        throughout Wales.\u000d\u000a      Internationally Williams's impact is evidenced through the recognition\u000d\u000a        by the United Nations of his contribution to the debate on older\u000d\u000a        people's rights and his central involvement in the UN Open Ended Working\u000d\u000a        Group (5.c). He has also advises Age International on constructing its\u000d\u000a        case for an international convention (5.b).

It\u000d\u000a      includes publications on elder abuse, social care, health care, the\u000d\u000a      criminal justice system and care home design. It focuses on the extent to\u000d\u000a      which older people are marginalised in the human rights discourse. The\u000d\u000a      basic tenet of the research is that law should be more age sensitive and\u000d\u000a      provide equal protection for people of all ages &#8212; see (3.a) and (3.c). The\u000d\u000a      link between human rights and social care was discussed in two articles in\u000d\u000a      the British Journal of Social Work &#8212; (3.a) and (3.d).\u000d\u000a    A particular area of concern is elder abuse and the nature of the state's\u000d\u000a      duty to prevent abuse and provide justice seeking options for those who\u000d\u000a      experience it. The research is based on a growing concern over the\u000d\u000a      prevalence of elder abuse. For the UK, it estimated that 4% of those aged\u000d\u000a      66 years and over (approximately 342,000 people) experience some form of\u000d\u000a      abuse. This excludes older people in institutional settings\u000d\u000a      and those lacking capacity. False comparisons are made with child\u000d\u000a      protection; these ignore the fact that adults and children are different &#8212;\u000d\u000a      (3.b), (3.c) and (3.e).\u000d\u000a\u0009  Williams' research highlights the difficulties\u000d\u000a      older people who experience abuse have in obtaining basic human rights\u000d\u000a      including justice and protection. &#8212; (3.h) and (3.j). Practitioners\u000d\u000a      currently rely on guidance (No Secrets in England and In Safe\u000d\u000a        Hands in Wales). Although this is helpful, it lacks the necessary\u000d\u000a      accountability when things go wrong. The lack of statutory duties results\u000d\u000a      in the `welfareisation' of abuse rather than seeing it as being about\u000d\u000a      accessing justice and protection. The case for a new public law on\u000d\u000a      vulnerable adult protection is advocated, in particular the imposition of\u000d\u000a      a statutory duty to investigate cases of suspected abuse. See (3.b),\u000d\u000a      (3.d), (3.e), (3.f), (3.h), (3.i) and (3.j). In response to his\u000d\u000a      contribution to this debate and involvement with the Welsh Government\u000d\u000a      planning group on social care reform and the National Assembly for Wales,\u000d\u000a      the Social Care and Wellbeing (Wales) Bill 2013 includes public law powers\u000d\u000a      for practitioners responding to cases of suspected abuse.\u000d\u000a    In addition, to the case for a new law, Williams' research highlights the\u000d\u000a      failure to use current law to its full extent to intervene to protect\u000d\u000a      older people at risk, and to ensure that appropriate criminal and other\u000d\u000a      legal remedies are pursued (3.c), (3.f), (3.h) and (3.j).\u000d\u000a    Further publications consider the extent to which older people's rights\u000d\u000a      are neglected, for example older prisoners and the need for care home\u000d\u000a      design to be human rights compliant.\u000d\u000a\u0009  His research resonates with the new\u000d\u000a      law making powers of the National Assembly for Wales and its law making\u000d\u000a      capacity. A particular issue relates to law reform capacity in Wales given\u000d\u000a      the acquisition of direct law making powers by the National Assembly. This\u000d\u000a      is discussed in the context of social care reform in the Statute Law\u000d\u000a      Review &#8212; (3.i). An ageing population presents global challenges. This has\u000d\u000a      raised the possibility of an international convention on the rights of\u000d\u000a      older people which is discussed by Williams in (3.g).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42108","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"718075","Name":"Macedonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"458258","Name":"Latvia"},{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Piotrowicz's research for the UNHCR trafficking guidelines has had a\u000a      direct impact on how states\u000a      deal with those at risk of being trafficked and has influenced the\u000a      development of policy. The\u000a      Guidelines have been cited in court judgments (eg, AZ v Secy of State\u000a        for the Home Department\u000a      [2010] UKUT 118, para 116) (5.7). His academic work has had impact through\u000a      his appointment\u000a      and election to international bodies (5.4). This recognises his expertise,\u000a      which in turn he has used\u000a      in his work with these organisations. He has contributed to the\u000a      development of law and policy on\u000a      trafficking in the EU through his participation in the European\u000a      Commission's Group of Experts. As\u000a      stated by the Chairperson of the Group, Dr Uhl, \"[h]e contributed\u000a      profoundly to the work and\u000a      discussions of the Group with his legal expertise\" (5.6). Piotrowicz's\u000a      nomination in 2012 by the UK\u000a      Government for election to GRETA was based on his academic work,\u000a      demonstrating external\u000a      recognition of its quality. He has already made one country-monitoring\u000a      visit, to Macedonia, and the\u000a      recommendations made subsequently are assisting the country concerned to\u000a      fulfil its anti-trafficking\u000a      obligations.\u000a    In 2012 Piotrowicz was appointed by the Special Coordinator for\u000a      Anti-Trafficking of the OSCE to\u000a      advise on the development of guidelines on how States should apply the\u000a      principle of non-punishment\u000a      to victims of trafficking. This was based on recognition of his academic\u000a      expertise as\u000a      developed in his publications. His work resulted in a report (April 2013),\u000a      which will have direct\u000a      impact on how States execute their obligation, through its elucidation of\u000a      the legal basis of the\u000a      principle and its application in different legal systems. The report has\u000a      already been cited by the\u000a      English Court of Criminal Appeal (L, HVN, THN and T v R, [2013]\u000a      EWCA Crim 991) (5.8).\u000a      Piotrowicz was nominated to be the rapporteur for two Opinions adopted by\u000a      the EU's Group of\u000a      Experts, and the adopted Opinions were about 70% and 90% of his work\u000a      respectively. The first\u000a      (5.2), on residence permits for victims of trafficking (2009), drew partly\u000a      upon Piotrowicz's previously\u000a      published research (\"European Initiatives in the Protection of Victims of\u000a      Trafficking Who Give\u000a      Evidence Against Their Traffickers\", 2002 (14) International Journal\u000a        of Refugee Law pp. 263-278).\u000a      The Opinion has been referred to by the European Commission in the\u000a      drafting of a new Directive\u000a      on the subject.\u000a    The second Opinion (5.1)was an evaluation of the first ever judgment of\u000a      the European Court of\u000a      Human Rights on human trafficking. The research for this has been\u000a      incorporated in an article\u000a      published in 2012 (3.2) The Opinion clarifies in practical terms States'\u000a      human rights obligations\u000a      towards people at risk of being trafficked. Its impact will be that it\u000a      contributes significantly to States'\u000a      awareness of their obligations towards victims and promotes their welfare.\u000a      Subsequently,\u000a      Piotrowicz was invited to address a high-level conference (government\u000a      ministers and\u000a      ambassadors) of the OSCE in Vienna in 2011 (5.9), the effect being to\u000a      communicate the results of\u000a      his research to the highest levels with regard to policy-making in the\u000a      field.\u000a    Piotrowicz has also had significant impact in anti-trafficking law\u000a      through training programmes in\u000a      migration law, organised by International Organisation of Migration and\u000a      the European Union, to\u000a      which he has been invited to contribute in many countries, including\u000a      Austria, Turkey, Latvia, Italy\u000a      and Germany. These involve the delivery of concentrated training sessions\u000a      on anti-trafficking law\u000a      and policy to those working in anti-trafficking, such as immigration\u000a      officials and non-governmental\u000a      organisations. Also in the area of direct dissemination of expertise,\u000a      Piotrowicz participated in a\u000a      project leading to publication of a handbook on migration law, by CUP, in\u000a      2012 (3.3), aimed at\u000a      practitioners in migration (government, international organisations and\u000a      non-governmental\u000a      organisations). The impact of Piotrowicz's published work is illustrated\u000a      by the comment on one of\u000a      his articles on trafficking by the Head of the International Migration Law\u000a      Unit at the International\u000a      Organization for Migration, Dr Touzenis, who wrote \"how valuable that\u000a      article has been to me in my\u000a      work, both research and in training activities, because of its clarity,\u000a      its approach and its very\u000a      complete analysis\" (5.3).\u000a    In addition, Piotrowicz is a regular contributor to the mass media,\u000a      including print journalism (The\u000a        Guardian, Times Higher Education) and the radio (BBC, Voice\u000a      of Russia, Voiced of America),\u000a      which regularly invites him to offer comment and analysis on the legal\u000a      dimension of major\u000a      international news stories. Consequently his research-driven expertise\u000a      enables him to contribute to\u000a      public debate of major issues and has impact by raising awareness of these\u000a      issues.\u000a      In October 2012 Piotrowicz was appointed adviser to the Government of\u000a      Romania on an\u000a      international project aimed at preventing trafficking of people for forced\u000a      begging. The appointment\u000a      was based directly on his expertise as shown by his research and\u000a      experience in the area. His work\u000a      has led to a handbook for police and judicial authorities on how to deal\u000a      with the phenomenon. He\u000a      has co-organised four international workshops on the subject in 2013 (in\u000a      Poiana Brasov, Vienna,\u000a      Paris and Brussels) and is co-organising a conference in Bucharest in\u000a      November 2013 at which\u000a      the handbook will be launched, This handbook will be made available to\u000a      police and judicial\u000a      authorities throughout Europe.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The work of Ryszard Piotrowicz in international law has had demonstrable\u000a      impact through his\u000a      influence in the development of law and policy with regard to human\u000a      trafficking, including court\u000a      citations. Recognition of Piotrowicz's published work led to appointment\u000a      (twice) to the European\u000a      Commission's Group of Experts on Trafficking in Human Beings, and his\u000a      nomination by the UK\u000a      Government, and election to GRETA (Council of Europe's Group of Experts on\u000a      Action against\u000a      Trafficking in Human Beings).

In 2001, Piotrowicz was\u000a      nominated by Australia to participate in the United Nations High\u000a      Commissioner for Refugees'\u000a      (UNHCR) Global Consultations programme: a series of meetings to which\u000a      UNHCR invited\u000a      specialists on refugee law, senior government officials as well as\u000a      representatives of civil society to\u000a      contribute to discussions on how best to apply the 1951 Convention on the\u000a      Status of Refugees to\u000a      global refugee problems. Piotrowicz contributed to the discussions, which\u000a      influenced the\u000a      development of refugee policy in the first decade of the 21st\u000a      century. In particular, he raised the\u000a      issue of trafficking of human beings, which had not been on the agenda.\u000a      Subsequently, he was\u000a      commissioned by UNHCR to draft guidelines on how refugee law can be used\u000a      to assist people at\u000a      risk of being trafficked. The draft prepared by Piotrowicz formed the\u000a      foundation of Guidelines,\u000a      published by UNHCR in 2006, which advise States on their obligations in\u000a      this situation. The\u000a      research elucidated how persons at risk of being trafficked may be\u000a      entitled to asylum. Most\u000a      importantly, Piotrowicz has demonstrated that the common perception of\u000a      human trafficking as a\u000a      human rights violation is incorrect. It is in fact a criminal act with a\u000a      human rights dimension:\u000a      trafficking is perpetrated by criminals; human rights become an issue in\u000a      terms of the response of\u000a      the state to this situation and how the state protects those at risk from\u000a      traffickers. This aspect has\u000a      been further analysed and explained by Piotrowicz. This work has been\u000a      published in international\u000a      journals. In 2012, Piotrowicz published an article in the International\u000a        Journal of Refugee Law (3.2)\u000a      on the practical ramifications for the human rights obligations of States\u000a      towards people at risk of\u000a      being trafficked, in light of a decision of the European Court of Human\u000a      Rights in 2010. The article\u000a      clarifies the exact nature of States' duties to prevent trafficking and to\u000a      protect and assist those at\u000a      risk of being, or who have been, trafficked.\u000a    In 2009 Piotrowicz published an article in Intercultural Human Rights\u000a        Law Review (3.5), which\u000a      critically analysed the legal nature of trafficking and demonstrates that\u000a      it is primarily a criminal act\u000a      with a human rights dimension. This article showed the development of his\u000a      thinking and clarified\u000a      how States should address trafficking in their legal systems. The article\u000a      strongly influenced his\u000a      work in drafting the Opinion No.6\/2010 of the EU Group of Experts on\u000a      Trafficking in Human Beings\u000a      (5.1).\u000a    In 2013 Piotrowicz was the principal author of a study on non-punishment\u000a      of victims of trafficking,\u000a      published by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe\u000a      (OSCE) (3.1), which has\u000a      already been cited in the English courts (5.9). This study addresses the\u000a      issue of how different\u000a      types of legal system can allow for people who have committed offence as a\u000a      result of being\u000a      trafficked not to be punished for this, on the basis that they are not\u000a      acting independently. It\u000a      analyses the international legal foundation for this and sets out\u000a      guidelines to assist states to amend\u000a      their national laws, where necessary, to respect the duty of\u000a      non-punishment. The work is\u000a      conceptually based but with very practical application.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42110","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has conferred benefit, and had impact, on society outside\u000a      the academic world at\u000a      three levels: local (via addresses to societies such as Local History\u000a      Groups and Women's Institutes\u000a      (see 5 a, 5e)), national (via broadcasting, see 5b,) and international\u000a      (via a website, see 5f). In\u000a      general terms it has brought a knowledge of Welsh Legal History to a range\u000a      of audiences largely\u000a      unaware of that history. At a time of focus upon legal identity,\u000a      uniformity and difference (due to the\u000a      Devolution settlement) it has helped towards bringing historical context\u000a      and insight to lay\u000a      understanding. The engagement with these varied lay audiences (often\u000a      elderly, often female) is\u000a      important, since a knowledge of Wales's legal past (largely ignored even\u000a      by professional legal\u000a      historians beyond Wales) raises awareness of the social context within\u000a      which the law has operated\u000a      and draws attention to aspects of past Welsh experience (language,\u000a      rurality, etc) which continue,\u000a      and will continue, to be of significance in contemporary Wales (\"It gave\u000a      us a completely new\u000a      perspective on the whole subject of law and order\", 5a). It also seeks to\u000a      contextualise, realistically\u000a      and by reference to the study of archival sources, the operation of past\u000a      criminal justice history, a\u000a      subject which attracts considerable public interest, yet one in which,\u000a      dogged by stereotype and\u000a      sensationalism, the public are often poorly served.\u000a    More specifically the engagement has taken a number of forms. Addresses\u000a      to public bodies,\u000a      societies and associations have been prominent. Ireland has taken part, by\u000a      invitation, in talks and\u000a      lectures to a variety of clubs and societies within West Wales. These\u000a      include Womens' Institutes,\u000a      Local History Societies and the like, often in small villages. Around 35\u000a      such speaking engagements\u000a      have been undertaken since 2008, and whilst some have been more general,\u000a      many have involved\u000a      presenting the results of specific research projects detailed above (crime\u000a      and punishment in\u000a      Victorian Wales, early criminal photography, women and crime, the Jacob\u000a      case and Victorian\u000a      prison life have been popular themes, see 3 a.) to 3.e) supra)).\u000a      It should be stressed that such\u000a      latter presentations (and others considered below) are detailed and\u000a      specifically related to original\u000a      sources explored by the author and are not undertaken for personal reward.\u000a      The result is a local\u000a      population as informed of its legal-historical heritage as any. The\u000a      contact also serves to challenge\u000a      any perceived barriers between the University and the locality within\u000a      which it is situated.\u000a    In similar vein Ireland has taken part in broadcasts, both in discrete\u000a      programmes (such as the BBC\u000a      Radio Wales Past Masters programme on The Sarah Jacob Case\u000a      (broadcast 26 April 2009) and in\u000a      appearances on magazine programmes (The Roy Noble Show BBC Radio\u000a      Wales). In 2013 a piece\u000a      on which he worked and in which he appeared on early criminal photography\u000a      and filmed, at his\u000a      suggestion, in Ruthin Gaol appeared on BBC 1's The One Show (27\u000a      June 2013: note the director's\u000a      comment \"Without his research and participation the film would have been\u000a      third-rate\" in 5b).\u000a    Ireland has been involved, having been invited for a preliminary\u000a      assessment of the material held, in\u000a      consultations with staff of Dyfed-Powys Police in relation to the\u000a      conservation, housing and display\u000a      of the Force's important historic archive (\"has provided invaluable advice\u000a      and support that has\u000a      made a significant impact on the future of the artefacts and archives\" see\u000a      5c). Discussions arising\u000a      out of this matter further led to a meeting also with the county\u000a      archivists of Carmarthenshire,\u000a      Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire and Powys (14 April 2011) with a view to the\u000a      long term allocation,\u000a      preservation and accessibility of the archive. On a related subject, but\u000a      specifically addressing the\u000a      issue of the public presentation of historical material, Ireland was also\u000a      involved in a meeting (10\u000a      May 2012) with individuals from Dyfed-Powys Police and a designer working\u000a      on a newly opened\u000a      display of crime and punishment in Carmarthen, at which he briefed those\u000a      present on the findings\u000a      of his work on criminality in the County and advised accordingly (\"with\u000a      this invaluable insight we\u000a      were able to recreate the prison cell...\", 5d).\u000a    He established in 2008 and maintains (with technical assistance by\u000a      Technoleg Taliesin) the\u000a      website of the Welsh Legal History Society\/Cymdeithas Hanes Cyfraith\u000a        Cymru. A founder\u000a      Committee member of this Society, Ireland devised the fully bilingual site\u000a      not only to give details of\u000a      the Society and its functions (to spread knowledge of, and promote\u000a      research into, the history of law\u000a      in Wales) but also (with the co-operation of archival repositories and\u000a      private individuals) to\u000a      establish a free online resource of research materials. The project is\u000a      ongoing, but includes a freely\u000a      accessible, searchable database of persons remanded to gaol in\u000a      Carmarthenshire between 1844\u000a      and 1871. The website, as evidenced by the detailed analytics, an overall\u000a      synopsis of which is\u000a      provided at 5f showing 4876 visitors to the site viewing 36,230 pages from\u000a      2008-end July 2013)), is\u000a      used by family and local historians as well as academics (as evidenced by\u000a      name searches within\u000a      the database). It is used internationally (in North America perhaps\u000a      particularly, but widely\u000a      elsewhere) as well as nationally and locally. It may be found at http:\/\/welshlegalhistory.org\/.\u000a      A presentation concerning this resource was made to delegates (largely\u000a      members of the legal\u000a      profession) at the important Legal Wales Conference in October 2009.\u000a    In all of these activities, public participation and debate is promoted\u000a      or assisted through the\u000a      responsible and informed involvement of a wide variety of individuals in\u000a      engagement with high\u000a      quality research in areas where there is otherwise public ignorance or,\u000a      worse still, partial and\u000a      stereotypical knowledge.

The\u000a      work is based on the\u000a      conviction that a failure to give proper consideration to material from\u000a      Wales has not only\u000a      impoverished understanding of the legal past of the country (which has\u000a      implications, for example,\u000a      on contemporary discussions as to whether there should be a \"separate\u000a      jurisdiction\" in Wales) but\u000a      has also distorted more generally the narrative of development of criminal\u000a      justice history within\u000a      England and Wales as a whole. So, for example, the detailed study of crime\u000a      and the responses to\u000a      it in Victorian Carmarthenshire, which saw its widest expression in a\u000a      monograph of 2007 (see 3c.),\u000a      challenges the writing of the history of criminal justice which is biased\u000a      in its concern with urban and\u000a      metropolitan experience and skewed by a fascination with serious\u000a      offending. Issues of cultural\u000a      variables such as language, tradition, religion and rurality feature\u000a      strongly within this text, as they\u000a      do in later work (see 3b.). At the same time the understanding of factors\u000a      which challenge\u000a      established social frameworks, understandings and differences-such as the\u000a      effects within the\u000a      nineteenth century of the impact of changing demography and immigration\u000a      (3f), or of photography\u000a      (as productive of and responsive to problems such as establishing a\u000a      concept of \"identity\" divorced\u000a      from local knowledge, 3e.) continue to inform the work. The approach is\u000a      unashamedly historical,\u000a      yet the issues raised within it are relevant outside the specific period\u000a      studied. The methodological\u000a      foundations of the research, relying on the recovery of lives of\u000a      \"ordinary\" people, even at the level\u000a      of their (literally) everyday experience (see 3d.), inevitably demand\u000a      reflection on the appropriate\u000a      audience for that work: a history of \"ordinary\" people which was presented\u000a      only to academic\u000a      audiences would be an uncomfortable paradox, a discussion of its findings\u000a      which ignored the\u000a      insights gained from exchanges with residents of modern rural Wales would\u000a      be blinkered.\u000a    Research material can be initiated by, and its results presented within,\u000a      a \"non-academic\" context\u000a      before being \"worked up\" for academic peers (3a., for example, is a form\u000a      of a paper which was a\u000a      plenary address to a British Legal History Conference, but originated in a\u000a      programme for BBC\u000a      Radio Wales). Research which is anchored in \"popular\" rather than\u000a      \"official\" perceptions of crime,\u000a      criminality and the perceived appropriate response to it, does not, of\u000a      course, involve the\u000a      renunciation of academic theoretical engagement: on the contrary, it\u000a      insists on challenging\u000a      dominant theoretical models which ignore such issues, or which\u000a      unthinkingly assume the priority of\u000a      change over stasis, the local over the (imagined) national or the \"legal\"\u000a      over the \"social\".\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42360","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"617790","Name":"Moldova"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Process from research to impact\u000a    The 1994 and 2001 reports were commissioned by the legal aid authorities\u000a      because a robust quality assessment mechanism was required in order to\u000a      implement franchising, contracting and competitive tendering on price. The\u000a      Legal Services Commission (LSC) accepted the 2001 report's recommendations\u000a      on peer review and implemented a three year rolling programme in 2003\u000a      using reviewers trained and monitored by the research team, of a sample of\u000a      contract holders in all areas of civil and criminal work in England and\u000a      Wales. This has continued to the present day under the aegis of Avrom\u000a      Sherr of London University. Professor Paterson was formally appointed by\u000a      the LSC as the designated cover for Professor Sherr in 2008.\u000a    Initially the dissemination of the quality assessment research by\u000a      Professors Sherr, Moorhead (now UCL) and Paterson was through the\u000a      publications listed in section 3. However, from presentations by\u000a      Professors Paterson and Sherr at the 2001, 2005 and 2007 International\u000a      Legal Aid Group (ILAG) conferences the leading policymakers of the most\u000a      developed legal aid programmes globally became aware of the outcome of the\u000a      peer review research. As a result, Professor Paterson, already Chair of\u000a      ILAG and the research adviser to SLAB, was asked to devise a peer review\u000a      scheme based on the teams' research to assess the quality of the legal\u000a      work done by the recently established Public Defence Solicitors Service\u000a      (PDSO) in early 2003. Shortly thereafter he became the adviser to a\u000a      partnership of SLAB, the Law Society and the Scottish Executive which\u000a      established peer review for all civil legal aid practitioners in Scotland\u000a      based on the research set out in section 2 (Source 1). Prof Paterson has\u000a      been responsible for the training and monitoring of the reviewers between\u000a      January 2008 and the present day. Lindsay Montgomery, the CEO of SLAB\u000a      stated in 2013 that \"the development of our quality regimes for legal\u000a        aid lawyers in Scotland was heavily influenced by the research work\u000a        published by Professor Paterson (in conjunction with Professor Sherr)\u000a        demonstrating the efficacy of peer review as a tool for quality\u000a        enhancement in the legal profession and legal aid\" (Source 4).\u000a    Strathclyde contribution to impact: The research contributions of\u000a      Paterson (University of Strathclyde) and Sherr (University of London &#8212;\u000a      Institute of Advanced Legal Studies) are approximately equal with respect\u000a      to peer review. Paterson took the initial lead on measuring quality, and\u000a      shared the responsibility for the research into, and eventual format of\u000a      the peer review, equally with Sherr. From 2003 onwards Moorhead\u000a      (University of Liverpool) played a major role in the implementation of the\u000a      research in England and Wales.\u000a    Types of Impact: The immediate impact of Paterson's research has\u000a      been the establishment of a peer review programme for civil and criminal\u000a      lawyers across the UK. The secondary impacts arising from this peer review\u000a      process are improvement in the quality of service provided, which in turn\u000a      has transferred to the recipients of Legal Aid. The UK peer review scheme\u000a      has now been implemented in several European countries with Paterson\u000a      playing a key role in the training of these reviewers.\u000a    Establishment of peer review system in the UK:\u000a    From 1st Jan 2008 to July 2009 400 civil firms in Scotland with around\u000a      800 practitioners and 4,000 files were assessed by peer review. An 18\u000a      month fundamental review of the civil peer review programme, conducted by\u000a      SLAB and the Law Society drawing on the monitoring work done by Professor\u000a      Paterson in relation to civil and children's peer review concluded that\u000a      peer review was reliable and value for money even in times of austerity.\u000a    In implementation of the review and in keeping with risk based quality\u000a      assurance the decision was taken in 2011 to extend the cycle to 6 years in\u000a      which every civil firm and practitioner's files would be assessed, to\u000a      focus particularly on poorer performing firms and to review a much larger\u000a      range of files for practitioners working in areas of law with vulnerable\u000a      clients (child law, mental health and immigration), together with the\u000a      existing review of all civil practitioners. Since the start of the third\u000a      cycle reviews of 140 firms, 320 practitioners and 2,240 files had been\u000a      conducted by January 2013. In 2011 despite the cuts to legal aid, the\u000a      Scottish Government, SLAB and the Law Society agreed to introduce a peer\u000a      review programme based on Professor Paterson's research to assess the work\u000a      of all 550 criminal law firms and 1500 criminal legal aid practitioners in\u000a      Scotland over a six year cycle (Source 2). By January 2013 80 firms, 230\u000a      practitioners and 2,000 files had been assessed.\u000a    In England and Wales the peer review programme conducted reviews of\u000a      approximately 1,000 firms between 2008 and 2012. The process in England\u000a      and Wales is on a sample basis rather than the case in Scotland where\u000a      every civil firm and practitioner is reviewed in cycles.\u000a    Quality of service provision:\u000a    The purpose of the quality assurance programme for legal aid providers is\u000a      not to covertly reduce the supply base, but to demonstrate the quality\u000a      floor that exists in the profession and to gradually raise overall\u000a      standards. The programme has established that errors in legal advice,\u000a      professional negligence or professional misconduct are relatively uncommon\u000a      in Scotland. The evidence also suggests that the programme is raising\u000a      standards. In the first cycle 10% of files failed the initial review\u000a      compared with 9% in the second. However, in the second cycle a tougher\u000a      standard was imposed to pass and in the third cycle the threshold has been\u000a      raised again. The proportion of special reviews (triggered by serious\u000a      concerns) reduced from 2% of firms in the first cycle to 0.5% of firms in\u000a      the second and the number of firms taken to final review decreased from 3%\u000a      to 2%. Further evidence of quality improvement stems from the fact that\u000a      practitioners and files received a higher proportion of distinction grades\u000a      in the second cycle (15.9% of practitioners and 11.6% of files as compared\u000a      with 13.7% of practitioners and 10.2% of files in the earlier cycle).\u000a    Benefits to recipients of Legal Aid:\u000a    The 350,000 persons a year who apply for or receive legal assistance each\u000a      year in Scotland, England and Wales are benefitting not just from the\u000a      raised standards, but from by a reduction in delays, an improvement in\u000a      client communications and a greater scrutiny of at risk files.\u000a    International reach and significance:\u000a    Dissemination at ILAG conferences in 2005 and 2007 led to requests for\u000a      Paterson to demonstrate the Scots peer review model in Canada, Chile,\u000a      Finland, Hong Kong, Moldova, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Northern\u000a      Ireland. Delegations from several of these jurisdictions have visited\u000a      Scotland to see the programme in action.\u000a    Paterson was invited by the Dutch legal aid authorities to demonstrate\u000a      peer review in Amsterdam and to train reviewers in 2008 to initiate a\u000a      pilot programme using peer review in mental health cases there in 2009. In\u000a      the meantime, the Dutch notaries made peer review compulsory in 2009 in\u000a      part drawing on demonstrations of the Scots programme. This was followed\u000a      by further training visits and a request in 2012 to assist with the\u000a      establishment of a pilot programme in social welfare in the Netherlands.\u000a    Inspired by a visit to Scotland to meet Paterson in 2007, the\u000a      representatives of the Ministry and The Finnish Bar Association agreed to\u000a      start examining different options for the development of quality\u000a      evaluation of legal aid in Finland. At the request of the Finnish Ministry\u000a      of Justice, Paterson demonstrated the peer review system in 2009 and in\u000a      2011 he provided training for 15 Finnish reviewers for a peer review pilot\u000a      programme there. In April 2013, the Head of Legal Aid in the Finnish\u000a      Ministry of Justice wrote, `The expertise of Professor Paterson has\u000a        been of key importance during the entire development process of the peer\u000a        review system in Finland. Thanks to Professor Paterson's\u000a        inspiring and professional training, the peer reviewers attending the\u000a        training were able to truly understand and appreciate the importance and\u000a        use of peer review as a quality evaluation method. The positive\u000a        experiences gained in England and Scotland convinced them of the\u000a        potential of peer review in getting valuable information on the quality\u000a        standard\" (Source 3).\u000a    In 2011, Paterson visited Moldova twice to train ten reviewers for a\u000a      criminal legal aid pilot peer review project there.\u000a    In summary: Scotland's legal aid lawyers are in effect being re-validated\u000a      well before the doctors in the UK, or the criminal advocates in England\u000a      and Wales, putting them ahead of anything that exists in other legal aid\u000a      countries\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact of a research programme into quality assessment measures for\u000a      publicly funded legal services has been the establishment of a peer review\u000a      programme for all civil and criminal lawyers operating in Scotland,\u000a      England and Wales. This programme has ensured that the quality of service\u000a      provided by legal aid lawyers in Scotland is consistently high, with only\u000a      10% of providers failing routine reviews. Moreover, the errors that do\u000a      emerge are primarily administrative failings rather than poor legal\u000a      advice. The Scottish model has been the basis for pilot projects in the\u000a      Netherlands, Finland and Moldova, and has been drawn on for a peer review\u000a      programme for all Dutch notaries.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Strathclyde\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Strathclyde (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Strathclyde","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007805}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1819729","Name":"Hong Kong"},{"GeoNamesId":"2759794","Name":"Amsterdam"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Publicly funded\u000a      legal services were late to come into the frame. Concerned by evidence\u000a      that most legal aid firms in England and Wales (70%) did only a small\u000a      proportion of the work (30% ) and were, therefore, by definition\u000a      `dabblers' who were likely to be doing the work inefficiently, the English\u000a      Legal Aid Board decided in 1993 to introduce optional contracting\u000a      (franchising ) for providers. In 2000, compulsory contracts were imposed\u000a      and now competitive tendering for contracts based on price is planned.\u000a      These initiatives (justified on value for money grounds) have all required\u000a      a robust quality assessment mechanism as an essential component in the\u000a      reforms. Similarly, in 2003 the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) introduced\u000a      quality assurance measures of its public defenders as part of the\u000a      justification for the expansion of their services.\u000a    Key research findings: Alan Paterson was first commissioned (along\u000a      with Professor Avrom Sherr and Richard Moorhead from Liverpool University)\u000a      by the English Legal Aid Board to provide a report [1], on assessing and\u000a      developing competence and quality in legal aid lawyers. At that time there\u000a      was no reliable, verifiable model for such an assessment. The theoretical\u000a      framework adopted and assessment of work done in other disciplines and\u000a      jurisdictions was provided by Professor Paterson and demonstrated for the\u000a      first time in the legal world (1) the potential for file auditing methods\u000a      for assessing quality, (2) that performance was a continuum (at a time\u000a      when quality in a professional context was seen as binary phenomenon), and\u000a      (3) the difficulties in identifying reliable proxies for quality in legal\u000a      services.\u000a    In 1998 the original research team were again commissioned by the Legal\u000a      Services Commission (LSC) to evaluate the quality of work done by lawyers\u000a      and the `not for profit' sector, who held the new legal contracts for\u000a      civil work that had been allocated by the LSC. The research [3], examined\u000a      a range of quality measures including peer review, model clients, client\u000a      satisfaction surveys and outcomes, and tested them against each other on a\u000a      substantial scale for the first time in a legal context. The fieldwork and\u000a      analysis established the reliability and validity of peer review (with\u000a      appropriate criteria, marking frameworks and training of assessors) and\u000a      showed (again for the first time) that it was the best available means for\u000a      assessing the quality of legal work. In 2003, Paterson's work for the\u000a      Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) demonstrated that file based peer review\u000a      was a viable quality measurement process for Scottish public defenders\u000a      [4]. In 2005, his work was used to justify and underpin the introduction\u000a      of peer review for civil legal aid practitioners in Scotland. In 2011, his\u000a      monitoring research work was again instrumental in the decision by SLAB\u000a      and the Law Society to expand civil and childrens' peer review in a risk\u000a      based direction.\u000a    Key researchers: For all of these reforms, the legal aid\u000a      authorities relied on research conducted by a small team of legal\u000a      researchers in the UK, one of whom was Professor Paterson, who has held a\u000a      Chair in Law at the University of Strathclyde from 1984 until the present\u000a      day.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42361","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Process from Research to Impact\u000d\u000a      The impact arises from the research commissioned in May 2007 by the Risk\u000d\u000a      Management Authority (RMA). Following its publication on the RMA website\u000d\u000a      in 2008, the report `Serious Violent Offenders: Developing a Risk\u000d\u000a      Assessment Framework' was widely circulated among policy makers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners working with the agencies involved in the risk assessment\u000d\u000a      and management of violent offenders.

The Chief Executive of the\u000d\u000a      Risk Management Authority Scotland has noted that the Government's, 2011,\u000d\u000a      Framework for Risk Assessment Management and Evaluation (FRAME) policy\u000d\u000a      paper (Source 1) was directly influenced by Barry et al.'s report, the\u000d\u000a      recommendations from which \"were opportune and influential\" in\u000d\u000a      creating the 2011 guidance, and notes that FRAME `applies across all\u000d\u000a        offender groups and agencies [and] to this extent the impact and reach\u000d\u000a        of [Barry et al.'s] report can be viewed as being significant'\u000d\u000a      (Source 2).\u000d\u000a    In one RMA document entitled `Violence Risk Assessment: Towards a\u000d\u000a      structured decision making framework: Phase 1' the RMA suggested that the\u000d\u000a      Barry et al. report was `[a] first step in a long-term project... the\u000d\u000a        journey towards a universal framework for violence [which] will not be\u000d\u000a        quick or straightforward'.\u000d\u000a    Chapter 1 page 6 of the FRAME guidance states \"This project is focused\u000d\u000a        on the development of a consistent, evidence-based framework for risk\u000d\u000a        assessment and management that is grounded in first principles and is\u000d\u000a        applicable across agencies and offender groups. . . The origins of this\u000d\u000a        project lie in the findings of earlier Scottish research [Barry et\u000d\u000a        al.2008] that sought to explore and advise on violence risk assessment.\u000d\u000a        The research identified confusion within and between agencies on\u000d\u000a        fundamental issues of understanding, assessing and communicating risk\"\u000d\u000a      (Source 1).\u000d\u000a    Impact on policy makers and policy\u000d\u000a      The RMA welcomed the recommendation that agencies collaborate to achieve\u000d\u000a      common definitions of risk and accepted that it should lead this process\u000d\u000a      through a national debate with stakeholders. The Multi-Agency Public\u000d\u000a      Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Guidance for Scottish professionals was\u000d\u000a      revised in early 2012 to incorporate Barry et al.'s recommendation that\u000d\u000a      the Violent and Sex Offender Register, which shares information between\u000d\u000a      police and social work, be rolled out nationally and include health boards\u000d\u000a      and prisons, and this has now been implemented.\u000d\u000a    Within the Scottish Government, the Community Justice division is now\u000d\u000a      looking at including violent offenders within MAPPA in view of developing\u000d\u000a      policies in this area (2013), and Scottish Government policy makers are\u000d\u000a      currently meeting with their counterparts in England and Wales regarding\u000d\u000a      lessons to be learnt from south of the border. The Scottish Government\u000d\u000a      also recently employed a researcher for two years to look at the\u000d\u000a      feasibility of violent offenders being incorporated into MAPPA. The Barry\u000d\u000a      et al. report was deemed crucial background reading for this new staff\u000d\u000a      member, since the report gives a clear structure to bringing violent\u000d\u000a      offenders into MAPPA (Source 3).\u000d\u000a    Impact on training of professionals\u000d\u000a      The RMA agreed with the recommendation that staff training on risk\u000d\u000a      assessment and management needed to be addressed. It also acknowledged\u000d\u000a      Barry et al.'s advice that training should not only focus on assessment\u000d\u000a      tools, but also on wider concepts of risk, risk formulation and theories\u000d\u000a      of risk and violence. The Chief Executive of the Risk Management Authority\u000d\u000a      Scotland noted that by May 2012 around one thousand social work staff had\u000d\u000a      undertaken this training, and the number has increased steadily since then\u000d\u000a      (Source 2).\u000d\u000a    The risk and needs assessment tool recommended by the Barry et al.\u000d\u000a      research was the Level of Service\/Case Management Inventory (LS\/CMI) which\u000d\u000a      supports criminal justice social workers to assess offender needs and risk\u000d\u000a      and to identify the most appropriate intervention. This tool has now been\u000d\u000a      wholly adopted by social work departments in Scotland and training in its\u000d\u000a      use is now complete. The recommendation that the tool's use and\u000d\u000a      effectiveness should be evaluated has been implemented, and in 2013\u000d\u000a      evaluation is ongoing (Source 3).\u000d\u000a    Influence on planning and strategy\u000d\u000a      In turn, this training and Barry et al.'s report are contributing to\u000d\u000a      further reflection within the RMA and among its key stakeholders on the\u000d\u000a      best way forward in the development of a consistent risk assessment and\u000d\u000a      management tool for violent offenders. The RMA consultation document\u000d\u000a      'Standards and Guidelines' (Dec 2012) acknowledged that \" a consensus has\u000d\u000a      developed in Scotland about the need to establish a meaningful way of\u000d\u000a      expressing risk that is shared between agencies and across geographical\u000d\u000a      boundaries\". This document was updated in March 2013 and now additionally\u000d\u000a      states that \"the publication of FRAME has laid the foundation for a shared\u000d\u000a      language of risk assessment and management\" (Source 4 p.103).\u000d\u000a    Management of risk\u000d\u000a      MAPPA operates 3 levels of risk to determine the intensity of agency input\u000d\u000a      into sexual and violent offenders: level 1 is low risk of harm and managed\u000d\u000a      by single agencies; level 2 is medium risk of harm and is managed by\u000d\u000a      practitioners in several relevant agencies; and level 3 is high risk of\u000d\u000a      harm and is managed by senior managers in several relevant agencies. The\u000d\u000a      aim is to downgrade the risk level according to the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      interventions, not least because level 2 and especially level 3 input is\u000d\u000a      intense and therefore costly. Since 2008, the number of sex offenders\u000d\u000a      managed at level 1 and down-graded from levels 2 and 3 has been\u000d\u000a      `significant' (Source 3). Level 1 offenders have increased to 88% of all\u000d\u000a      high risk offenders managed under MAPPA in 2012 compared to 76% in 2010,\u000d\u000a      and 66% in 2009, following on from Barry et al.'s recommendation that\u000d\u000a      categories of offender risk should be monitored and downgraded based on\u000d\u000a      sound risk assessment, management and regular review.\u000d\u000a    Wider influences\u000d\u000a      Since 2008, Barry's research has reached a wider audience of professionals\u000d\u000a      including a Think Tank organised by the Scottish Centre for Crime and\u000d\u000a      Justice Research (2008) and senior policy makers and practitioners in risk\u000d\u000a      assessment and management of high risk offenders at Rikkyo University in\u000d\u000a      Tokyo, Japan (2011). The Scottish Government's Children, Young People and\u000d\u000a      Social Care Directorate consulted with Barry on the future implementation\u000d\u000a      of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007. Her research\u000d\u000a      is referred to in Chapter 7 of Scottish Youth Justice Practice Guidance,\u000d\u000a      Feb 2013, (Source 4) noting that the comprehensive assessment of an\u000d\u000a      offender must include an assessment of the likelihood of the individual\u000d\u000a      committing further offences.\u000d\u000a      In 2012, Barry was funded by the London Probation Trust to undertake a\u000d\u000a      study of MAPPA processes and outcomes across London. This informed a\u000d\u000a      large-scale research proposal to ESRC in mid-2013 to compare the Scottish\u000d\u000a      risk assessment and management framework with similar developments in\u000d\u000a      England.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research commissioned by the Risk Management Authority (RMA) assessed\u000d\u000a      criminal justice practice in Scotland relating to high risk offenders, and\u000d\u000a      provided the rationale and founding principles for the RMA to create a\u000d\u000a      Framework for Risk Assessment, Management and Evaluation (FRAME),\u000d\u000a      published in July 2011.

The Social Work Inspection Agency also reported that while the\u000d\u000a      risk assessment and management of sexual offenders was well developed, the\u000d\u000a      same practice with violent offenders required further attention. The Risk\u000d\u000a      Management Authority (RMA) then initiated an enquiry into violence risk\u000d\u000a      assessment which would result in core recommendations for the development\u000d\u000a      of a violence assessment framework, to be implemented across agencies, in\u000d\u000a      order to reduce reoffending among violent offenders by grounding risk\u000d\u000a      practice in shared principles, values and standards.\u000d\u000a    Underpinning research:\u000d\u000a      In May 2007, the RMA was tasked with undertaking research to inform\u000d\u000a      whether violent offenders should be brought into multi-agency public\u000d\u000a      protection arrangements (MAPPA) which then only covered sex offenders in\u000d\u000a      Scotland. To do this, the RMA commissioned a team of researchers, led by\u000d\u000a      Dr Monica Barry, Senior Research Fellow at the University of Strathclyde,\u000d\u000a      to research and report on the development of a risk assessment framework\u000d\u000a      for violent offenders by evaluating current and developing research,\u000d\u000a      policy and practice within MAPPA. The team also included Prof. Hazel\u000d\u000a      Kemshall (De Montfort University) and Nancy Loucks (independent\u000d\u000a      criminologist). Barry et al. were successful in securing this research\u000d\u000a      funding following competitive tender, partly based on the fact that\u000d\u000a      Barry's earlier international literature review for the Scottish Executive\u000d\u000a      [1] had a high profile in academia and also in policy circles.\u000d\u000a    The commissioned project included in-depth interviews with policy makers\u000d\u000a      and practitioners\/managers in Scotland, and an international literature\u000d\u000a      review, which resulted in the co-authored final report, Serious Violent\u000d\u000a      Offenders: Developing a Risk Assessment Framework (2008) [2]. The key\u000d\u000a      findings from the research were that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Definitions of risk, violence and harm vary across agencies and\u000d\u000a        professionals;\u000d\u000a      Different classifications of risk fail to offer definitive guidance to\u000d\u000a        professionals in different fields and one working definition of harm\u000d\u000a        across all agencies would be welcomed by most agencies;\u000d\u000a      Movement of offenders between risk levels was constrained, not least\u000d\u000a        in terms of downgrading and exiting the system, and it was feared that\u000d\u000a        violent offenders would `swamp' the system;\u000d\u000a      Inter-agency cooperation was viewed as constructive and effective in\u000d\u000a        current work with sex offenders, but clearer guidelines, protocols and\u000d\u000a        agreements would ensure greater accountability when including violent\u000d\u000a        offenders;\u000d\u000a      Greater compatibility was needed in IT systems, information sharing\u000d\u000a        and training across the various agencies.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The final report not only underlined areas of attention and development,\u000d\u000a      but also made crucial recommendations to promote multi-agency practice.\u000d\u000a      Based on her fieldwork, Dr Barry established how agencies in Scotland\u000d\u000a      define risk and work with violent offenders. In particular, the interview\u000d\u000a      data showed concern amongst policy makers and practitioners about the\u000d\u000a      feasibility and viability of the current framework for sexual offenders\u000d\u000a      being a potential model for a violence assessment framework. Such a\u000d\u000a      framework could only be achieved by addressing the differing definitions\u000d\u000a      of risk, harm and violence used across agencies with different remits. The\u000d\u000a      report's findings underlined the need to establish agreed values, develop\u000d\u000a      a structured approach, and adopt shared practice standards and a common\u000d\u000a      language of risk across the agencies intervening in the risk assessment\u000d\u000a      and management process.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers: Dr Monica Barry, Senior Research Fellow, School\u000d\u000a      of Law, University of Strathclyde (April 2007 to present); Professor Hazel\u000d\u000a      Kemshall, De Montfort University; and Nancy Loucks, Independent\u000d\u000a      Criminologist.

Chief Justice Denham has stated that \"ISIS has proven\u000a      to be a significant improvement over previous paper-based record systems\u000a      in Ireland, and was developed with the helpful advice and assistance of\u000a      Professor Cyrus Tata based on his prior research and development of the\u000a      Scottish Sentencing Information System\" [Source E].Key issues on which\u000a      Tata advised were: public access and institutionalisation, data quality\u000a      and recording, case taxonomy, politics of sentencing reform, and\u000a      accordingly in some key respects the Irish approach improves on that of\u000a      Scotland. Unlike the Scottish SIS, the Irish system is publicly available.\u000a      Contemporaneous data is recorded by those trained for the task. ISIS\u000a      continues to be directed by a steering committee chaired by the Chief\u000a      Justice, (rather than delegated to court\/IT managers), and is expected to\u000a      be taken over by a Judicial Council [Source E].\u000a    An initial data collection phase of the project ran between 2007-9 in\u000a      Dublin, Cork and Limerick Circuit Criminal Courts, Dublin District Court\u000a      (29993 cases) and the Court of Criminal Appeal (305 cases). The ISIS\u000a      website was launched in 2010 by which point it contained information on\u000a      over 1000 cases [Source C]. In January 2013 funding was secured to enable\u000a      further expansion and development of ISIS [Source A]. Announcing this\u000a      development, the Chief Justice of Ireland said ISIS \"...gives a practical\u000a      overview and a snapshot in time of how our courts treat various offences,\u000a      who committed them and the circumstances in which they took place. It is\u000a      also a hub for keeping up with the latest judgments and academic thoughts\u000a      on various crimes and sentencing\".\u000a    Types of Impact:\u000a    1. Introduction of new technology to aid awareness of sentencing:\u000a      Prior to ISIS, public access to legal records was virtually non-existent.\u000a      Although paper-based records were sometimes available they did not permit\u000a      a meaningful picture of sentencing practices. As a web-enabled database,\u000a      ISIS provides quick and easy access to sentencing patterns, individual\u000a      cases and other relevant knowledge about sentencing, according to a\u000a      flexible range of search criteria. ISIS aims to provide flexibility so\u000a      that information is available at aggregate and individual case levels and\u000a      including both first instance and appealed and data collection is ongoing.\u000a      ISIS has international reach. Over 8900 user visits in 2011 originated in\u000a      50 different countries with the bulk coming from Ireland, the USA, the UK\u000a      and the Netherlands. Search phrases used indicate that users are looking\u000a      for information about specific cases as well as more general information\u000a      about sentencing in the Irish Republic. By 31st December 2012\u000a      there had been 32,544 hits on the ISIS website with over 8500 user visits,\u000a      and in the first quarter of 2013 alone there were 18,193 hits from 48\u000a      countries.\u000a    2. Practitioner Decision-Making: ISIS enables judges, and others\u000a      engaged in the sentencing process to develop their knowledge and\u000a      understanding of sentencing practices, so enhancing the pursuit of\u000a      fairness and consistency in sentencing. This not only assists sentencing\u000a      practitioners, but also benefits those brought before the courts (e.g.\u000a      defendants, witnesses including victims), as well as the wider public\u000a      [Source C]. As well as being a point-of-sentence tool, consistent with\u000a      Tata's advice, the ISIS project has begun to mine the data to produce\u000a      occasional published reports about matters of particular legal and public\u000a      interest, which together with a regular series of sentencing seminars run\u000a      by the ISIS steering committee, help to inform practitioners. The ability\u000a      of ISIS to assist the pursuit of fairness and consistency in sentencing\u000a      and public knowledge without threatening judicial independence and\u000a      impartiality is widely regarded as a particularly significant development.\u000a      For example, The Irish Justice and Equality Minister said in the Irish\u000a      Penal Reform Trust Annual Lecture 16th September 2011 that \"The system\u000a        [ISIS] informs judges &#8212; it does not interfere with judicial independence\u000a        in sentencing. . . As Minister, I believe the website to be of great\u000a        assistance in ensuring greater uniformity of sentencing.\" [Source\u000a      D]. Around 500,000 criminal matters are dealt with by the Irish criminal\u000a      justice system each year. By 2010 ISIS contained information on over 1000\u000a      cases [Source C].\u000a    3. Stimulation of Public Discourse: A wide range of Irish media\u000a      have welcomed the public accessibility of ISIS as an act of transparency\u000a      in the exercise of justice [Source F,G]. In making the ISIS publicly\u000a      accessible, the Irish approach contrasts favourably with that of Scotland,\u000a      as Tata advised the ISIS Steering Committee that the refusal to make the\u000a      SIS Scotland publicly accessible was one of the key reasons why it lost\u000a      momentum shortly after full implementation. Public access helps to embed\u000a      the system into everyday practices, as well as assist the public\u000a      understanding of sentencing and contributing to confidence in the justice\u000a      system. ISIS aids knowledge of , and understanding about sentencing and\u000a      criminal justice, which helps to stimulate more informed public debate.\u000a      [Source C] In late January 2013, consistent with advice and research of\u000a      Tata (2000), data in ISIS has begun to be mined to produce occasional\u000a      `Sentencing Snapshot' reports which have been prominently reported in the\u000a      media , thus contributing to public knowledge and understanding, [Sources\u000a      C,H,I]. ISIS has also been referred to in public discussion and debate\u000a      about sentencing practices sparked by high profile and controversial cases\u000a      [Source J]\u000a    4. ISIS enables greater predictability in the planning of policy and\u000a        management of criminal justice services: Beneficiaries also include\u000a      criminal justice managers and policy-makers including court service\u000a      managers dealing with the flows of first instance and appeal cases,\u000a      prosecution, prisons and community justice sectors. Greater knowledge and\u000a      understanding of sentencing, its dynamics, and the drivers of sentencing\u000a      trends enhance the ability to plan the provision of services (and the more\u000a      efficient expenditure of precious resources) and provide a more informed\u000a      basis for the development of criminal justice policy. For example, a\u000a      recent White Paper on Crime issued by the Department of Justice and\u000a      Equality commented : \"A development of some significance is the Irish\u000a      Sentencing Information System (ISIS) website [...]. This publicly\u000a      accessible resource includes statistics on sentencing, synopses of\u000a      relevant court judgments and a database on sentences imposed in various\u000a      crimes and cases.... [a] valuable tool not only for legal practitioners\u000a      and researchers but also for those concerned with the needs of victims and\u000a      their families.\" [Source K]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In 2010 a Sentencing Information System (ISIS) for the Republic of\u000a      Ireland was launched. Its development was partly based on an earlier\u000a      system developed for use in Scotland, and the ISIS project was informed by\u000a      the research which underpinned the Scottish system. The experience of this\u000a      Scottish-based research informed advice given by Tata to the Judiciary and\u000a      Court Service of the Republic of Ireland; a key recommendation was the\u000a      need for public accessibility of the system to ensure maximum utility. The\u000a      Irish system was launched in 2010 is now in use by judges and other\u000a      practitioners as well as the wider public. ISIS assists judicial\u000a      decision-making through the provision of meaningful, systematic\u000a      information about sentencing; and its public availability has helped to\u000a      shape and inform public discourse about sentencing and wider issues of\u000a      justice.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Strathclyde\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Strathclyde (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Strathclyde","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007805}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2964574","Name":"Dublin"},{"GeoNamesId":"2964574","Name":"Dublin City"},{"GeoNamesId":"2962943","Name":"Limerick"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

From 1995 to 2002 theoretical\u000a      research detailed below, was used to develop a prototype Sentencing\u000a      Information System for High Court judges in Scotland. The aim of the\u000a      system was to help judges during the process of sentencing by providing\u000a      access to a database (a Sentencing Information System or SIS) containing\u000a      sentencing information.\u000a    Key research findings: In most jurisdictions, information about\u000a      sentencing is unsystematic, of variable reliability, fails to deal\u000a      adequately with multi-offence cases and previous convictions, and can\u000a      easily lead to spurious implications (Tata 1997; 1998b). Therefore, trying\u000a      simply to feed ready-made administrative data into an information system\u000a      will not provide the kind of high quality sentencing information which\u000a      judges and others are seeking. The origination of a sentencing taxonomy\u000a      for the recording and retrieval of information is therefore vital (Tata\u000a      1997; 1998b; 2000).\u000a    \u000a      Public access to an SIS can inform the understanding of sentencing and\u000a        penal policy among legal and other criminal justice practitioners,\u000a        policy-makers and the wider public and so lead to a more productive\u000a        policy discourse. Rather than posing a threat to judicial independence,\u000a        properly managed public access to an SIS offers potential to shore up\u000a        collective judicial independence and public confidence (Tata and Hutton\u000a        2003).\u000a      Precisely because of its emphasis on description, (rather than\u000a        explicit prescription), and on use being non-mandatory, the authority\u000a        and institutionalisation of an SIS are key issues. The use of an SIS by\u000a        lawyers is a crucial mechanism by which an SIS can become embedded into\u000a        everyday routine practices (Tata 2000).\u000a      How to conceptualise and represent case similarity in sentencing\u000a        meaningfully is a fundamental conceptual challenge, which some consider\u000a        insurmountable. The SIS in Scotland showed that it is possible to do. It\u000a        developed two main ways of conceptualising and representing the\u000a        similarity of cases. One of these approaches was particularly novel and\u000a        sought to overcome a long-standing problem in previous academic and\u000a        official attempts to research sentencing (see Tata 1997, 1998a, 1998b,\u000a        2007). This was the attempt to capture and explicate the holistic and\u000a        intuitive ways in which judges think about sentencing cases.\u000a      An artificial intelligence approach is highly unlikely to gain support\u000a        (Tata 1998a, 1998b). Judges and other users greatly value flexibility in\u000a        the ways in which information can be retrieved, not least to view\u000a        information statistically and textually. This flexibility means,\u000a        however, that the task of measuring the effect of an SIS on sentencing\u000a        practices is more complex than it might first seem and that a\u000a        multi-dimensional approach to examining the effects is required (Tata\u000a        2000).\u000a      Data recording is not a simple technical matter. The experience of\u000a        Scotland emphasises the importance of consistent and accurate recording\u000a        of SIS data, overseen by a quality control system. Such an on-going\u000a        process is more assured where the SIS has a judicial institutional home\u000a        Tata 200; Tata and Hutton 2003).\u000a      An SIS has no hope of being a point-of-sentence tool unless it is\u000a        constructed together with its judicial users and in a way meaningful to\u000a        them (Tata 1998a, 1998b).\u000a      Delegation of an SIS to the courts' IT department will lead to\u000a        failure. A partnership between judges, sentencing scholars, court\u000a        managers, and IT specialists is necessary (Tata and Hutton 2003).\u000a      The development of an SIS cannot be understood apart from the legal\u000a        and political environment. Judicial leadership and corporate vision are\u000a        of the highest importance (Tata 2000; Tata and Hutton 2003).\u000a    \u000a    Key researchers: The research was conducted in School of Law,\u000a      University of Strathclyde from 1993-2003 by Neil Hutton Senior Lecturer;\u000a      Alan Paterson Professor of Law; Cyrus Tata Research Fellow\/\u000a      Lecturer\/Senior Lecturer; in collaboration with John Wilson, Lecturer\u000a      Department of Computer Science, University of Strathclyde, who contributed\u000a      research to the design and structure of the Scottish database.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42771","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In July 2009, Cullet was invited by the Indian Government to participate\u000d\u000a      in a meeting convened to debate a discussion paper on Integrated Water\u000d\u000a      Management &#8212; Policy and Actions. Following this meeting, Dr Mihir Shah,\u000d\u000a      member of the Indian Government's Planning Commission with responsibility\u000d\u000a      for water, requested that Cullet contribute a law section to the\u000d\u000a      discussion paper in question. Dr Shah also subsequently read Cullet's Water\u000d\u000a        Law, Poverty and Development &#8212; Water Law Reforms in India, as\u000d\u000a      evidenced by the direct (and indirect) references to the text in the\u000d\u000a      Planning Commission's Mid Term Appraisal for the Eleventh Five Year Plan,\u000d\u000a      2007-2012. Cullet then attended informal meetings with the Commission\u000d\u000a      throughout 2010, being formally included in the working group on water\u000d\u000a      governance for the preparation of the twelfth five-year plan set up in\u000d\u000a      October 2010 (5 to 8, below).\u000d\u000a    During the initial meetings of the working group, it was decided that\u000d\u000a      three sub-groups would be formed, each tasked with the preparation of\u000d\u000a      three new draft laws. Cullet was asked to chair the sub-group working to\u000d\u000a      draft a new groundwater model bill, and to become a member of the sub-\u000d\u000a      group dealing with national framework legislation (1, 2). The latter group\u000d\u000a      prepared a draft National Water Framework Act with the aim of ensuring\u000d\u000a      that the country has one set of overall principles guiding the water\u000d\u000a      sector at the union level (3, 4). This Act constituted a reaction to the\u000d\u000a      fact that none of the states in India has ever adopted legislation that\u000d\u000a      outlines the basic parameters and principles governing the water sector.\u000d\u000a    The task of the sub-group on groundwater, however, was more challenging,\u000d\u000a      since it required an updating of the Indian Government's existing model\u000d\u000a      bill on groundwater, previously modified in 2005, but which reflected\u000d\u000a      substantially an earlier draft from 1970. The group was highly critical of\u000d\u000a      the inadequacies of the existing legal framework for groundwater, pointing\u000d\u000a      to its failure to reflect the fundamental right to water, and to address\u000d\u000a      the direct links between rights to groundwater and land ownership that\u000d\u000a      exclude a vast number of landless people. Its members agreed that an\u000d\u000a      entirely different approach to groundwater legislation was needed and, in\u000d\u000a      particular, a re-thinking of the rules governing access to and control\u000d\u000a      over groundwater that had been in force since the late nineteenth century.\u000d\u000a      The group thus drafted alternative legislation, along with a reasoned\u000d\u000a      explanation for their decisions, a task which was made more challenging by\u000d\u000a      the recommendation of a previous expert group on groundwater that no\u000d\u000a      substantial changes to the legal framework were necessary.\u000d\u000a    Informed by Cullet's research, the central objectives of the new model\u000d\u000a      bill include the need to regulate and control iniquitous groundwater use\u000d\u000a      and distribution; to ensure safe drinking water for all; to regulate\u000d\u000a      groundwater extraction to ensure its sustainability; and to prevent the\u000d\u000a      contamination of groundwater resources. Such changes to the legal\u000d\u000a      framework are intended to aid in guaranteeing that the use of groundwater\u000d\u000a      in India becomes both more socially equitable and environmentally\u000d\u000a      sustainable.\u000d\u000a    While it is too early to judge the eventual impact of the model bill, the\u000d\u000a      two broader consultations conducted during 2011 indicated that experts and\u000d\u000a      central and state government representatives were largely in agreement\u000d\u000a      with the general scheme proposed in the draft model bill. Moreover, in\u000d\u000a      April 2012, the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called for a new\u000d\u000a      legal framework to govern groundwater extraction and use and naming\u000d\u000a      groundwater conservation as an `urgent priority' (9, 10). Impact will take\u000d\u000a      time to materialise since, under the Indian Constitution, a bill adopted\u000d\u000a      by the central government must then be legislated by each state\u000d\u000a      individually; there is thus a time lag from adoption to implementation. In\u000d\u000a      this case, however, the process may be shortened because the Planning\u000d\u000a      Commission aims to use financial conditionality as a means of imposing the\u000d\u000a      adoption of the new model bill by state governments.\u000d\u000a    The future of India and its neighbours is very much dependent on\u000d\u000a      decisions taken now to protect and provide equitable access to water for\u000d\u000a      the region's growing population, particularly in light of consistently\u000d\u000a      falling water tables and the fact that 80% of India's population rely on\u000d\u000a      groundwater to meet their drinking water needs. Philippe Cullet's research\u000d\u000a      and provision of expert advice directly to Indian senior policy makers has\u000d\u000a      had a notable impact on the conceptual framework informing water law and\u000d\u000a      governance, shifting patterns of ownership from individual landowners to\u000d\u000a      the state, and thereby rendering water use both more socially equitable\u000d\u000a      and environmentally sustainable.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Government of India has put forward a National Water Framework Act\u000d\u000a      arising from part of the work of the national Planning Commission.\u000d\u000a      Philippe Cullet's research on water law and governance has directly\u000d\u000a      impacted upon the nature of India's planned legislation on the issue,\u000d\u000a      facilitated by his chairmanship of a group within India's Planning\u000d\u000a      Commission.

He is also Senior Visiting Fellow at the\u000d\u000a      Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi.\u000d\u000a    Much of Cullet's research focuses on water law and governance,\u000d\u000a      specifically on groundwater, drinking water, sanitation and institutional\u000d\u000a      reforms in India. Water governance is a contentious issue in India, where\u000d\u000a      a significant percentage of the population do not have sufficient access\u000d\u000a      to drinking water for reasons including falling water tables, declining\u000d\u000a      infrastructure, economic factors and social norms. These problems,\u000d\u000a      however, have long been ignored in the drafting of water law, which is\u000d\u000a      concerned primarily with water's economic potential and the rights of\u000d\u000a      landowners. The unprecedented number of water reforms adopted since the\u000d\u000a      late 1990s have thus been conceived within a narrow framework, overlooking\u000d\u000a      existing scientific knowledge and new challenges, such as those posed by\u000d\u000a      the increase in groundwater use.\u000d\u000a    Cullet's research addresses the failure of the conceptual framework\u000d\u000a      informing water law reforms to consider the multiplicity of water uses and\u000d\u000a      functions, especially its human right, social and environmental\u000d\u000a      dimensions, issues widely explored in his 2009 monograph, Water Law,\u000d\u000a        Poverty and Development: Water Sector Reforms in India. Using\u000d\u000a      primary sources and an analysis of legal frameworks and their underpinning\u000d\u000a      ideas, Cullet proposes broad-based reforms to water laws at the national\u000d\u000a      level informed by a human rights, equity and sustainability perspectives.\u000d\u000a      Such reforms would help to ensure that water laws contribute to the\u000d\u000a      realisation of the human right to water for the poor and marginalised,\u000d\u000a      particularly in rural areas, rather than focussing simply on water's\u000d\u000a      economic dimension.\u000d\u000a    Similarly, output b examines the on-going development of Indian case law\u000d\u000a      concerning water, specifically the relationship between water and the\u000d\u000a      environment and control over water. Cullet assesses the most recent water\u000d\u000a      sector and law reforms, which propose drastic changes to the sector, and\u000d\u000a      outlines the problems posed by the Indian courts' lack of a unified\u000d\u000a      response. Output c continues to evaluate water laws in India,\u000d\u000a      demonstrating that, while the fundamental right to water has been a part\u000d\u000a      of Indian law for over two decades, there is no binding drinking water\u000d\u000a      legislation to support this right. Cullet contends that all reforms should\u000d\u000a      be based on the clear-cut premise that the fundamental right to water\u000d\u000a      prevails over other rights.\u000d\u000a    More recently, Cullet published \"Groundwater: Towards a New Legal and\u000d\u000a      Institutional Framework\" in his co-edited book on water conflicts in India\u000d\u000a      (output d). Cullet here underlines the deficiencies of the existing legal\u000d\u000a      framework governing groundwater in India (which is based on\u000d\u000a      nineteenth-century principles), asserting that it leads to further\u000d\u000a      deterioration of the resource annually. With 80% of the country's drinking\u000d\u000a      water needs derived from groundwater, Cullet argues for the necessity of\u000d\u000a      reforms that ensure a delinking of access to groundwater from land rights,\u000d\u000a      but in such a way as to preclude a more damaging form of privatisation\u000d\u000a      that would adversely affect groundwater users.\u000d\u000a    Taken together, Cullet's research is the only sustained academic effort\u000d\u000a      to analyse the multi- pronged reforms taking place in water law in India\u000d\u000a      since the 1990s.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42790","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"366755","Name":"Sudan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, Baderin's evolving body of work concerning the relationship\u000d\u000a      between Islamic law and international human rights has resulted in\u000d\u000a      international recognition of his expertise and its widespread uptake,\u000d\u000a      notably through his appointment as an advisor to DFID and FCO in the UK,\u000d\u000a      and as UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the\u000d\u000a      Sudan.\u000d\u000a    In relation to UK policy, Baderin was commissioned in 2008 by DFID as a\u000d\u000a      human rights expert on scoping visits to the Sudan, having previously\u000d\u000a      undertaken similar work in 2003.

Baderin's findings were outlined in two reports\u000d\u000a      submitted to DFID. More recently, he was invited in 2013 to join the UK\u000d\u000a      Foreign Secretary William Hague's Human Rights Advisory Group, which meets\u000d\u000a      regularly to discuss pressing human rights issues and to offer external,\u000d\u000a      impartial advice on foreign policy practice. Hague's invitation letter\u000d\u000a      stated that he felt it `important to have a Muslim perspective on the\u000d\u000a      human rights issues affecting our foreign policy (...).

Participants at the third\u000d\u000a      meeting included the Senior Minister of State Baroness Warsi, religious\u000d\u000a      leaders, theologians and experts in religious affairs.\u000d\u000a    However, Baderin's most significant impact has been outside the UK,\u000d\u000a      through his appointment in 2011 as UN Independent Expert on the situation\u000d\u000a      of human rights in the Sudan, a mandate renewed for an additional year in\u000d\u000a      2012 (3). Similar to his DFID post, Baderin was required to meet with the\u000d\u000a      Sudanese government, its international partners, NGOs and human rights\u000d\u000a      defenders to ascertain the technical assistance and capacity building\u000d\u000a      needs of the Sudanese government for it to comply with international human\u000d\u000a      rights mechanisms. Drawing on his research on the relationship between\u000d\u000a      Islamic law and international human rights in an African context, and his\u000d\u000a      fluency in Arabic, Baderin was ideally positioned to adopt this post, as\u000d\u000a      acknowledged in the report of the Consultative Group to the President of\u000d\u000a      the Human Rights Council:\u000d\u000a    `Mr Baderin has extensive academic and in-country experiences as a\u000d\u000a        specialist in human rights and Islamic law.

The Group remarked in particular his ability to\u000d\u000a        articulate the relationships between Islamic law and culture within\u000d\u000a        Sudan.'\u000d\u000a    To date, Baderin has completed three visits to the Sudan on behalf of the\u000d\u000a      UN (5, 6). His findings and recommendations have been discussed in\u000d\u000a      numerous international press conferences and were compiled in a report to\u000d\u000a      the UN Human Rights Council in September 2013 (4, 7).\u000d\u000a    In addition, Baderin's research has impacted upon the teaching of Islamic\u000d\u000a      law and international human rights in higher education. It constitutes `a\u000d\u000a      main source of reference' for the module `Islamic Law and Human Rights' at\u000d\u000a      the University of Khartoum, for example, as part of the cross-disciplinary\u000d\u000a      Post-Graduate Diploma in Human Rights. Mohamed Abdelsalam Babiker,\u000d\u000a      Assistant Professor of International Law at the University, explains that\u000d\u000a      Baderin's material was chosen (8):\u000d\u000a    `because it promotes a harmonious relationship between human rights\u000d\u000a        and Islamic law. In this respect, it addresses contemporary and\u000d\u000a        difficult issues, both in law and practice, that pertain to the Sudan as\u000d\u000a        a modern Muslim state. Since 2005 his scholarship has been taught and\u000d\u000a        there is no doubt whatsoever it generates serious debate, inspires and\u000d\u000a        engages the minds of our students on contemporary critical rights and\u000d\u000a        relate them to the Sudan's context.

Moreover, both his ground-breaking research and his advisory\u000d\u000a      roles ensure not only that a Muslim perspective is considered in the\u000d\u000a      on-going discussions surrounding human rights policy and practice in the\u000d\u000a      UK, but also raise awareness of the potential positive interaction between\u000d\u000a      Islamic law and international human rights.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The predominant perception of the relationship between Islamic law and\u000d\u000a      international human rights law is that of one grounded in conflict, with\u000d\u000a      Islamic law often presented as fundamentally incompatible with the tenets\u000d\u000a      of international human rights. Mashood Baderin's research challenges this\u000d\u000a      notion, arguing that, while the two legal systems operate differently in\u000d\u000a      terms of scope and application, they also share important commonalities\u000d\u000a      that facilitate the fulfilment of human rights obligations in Muslim\u000d\u000a      states.

He joined SOAS as Professor of Law in 2007\u000d\u000a      where he was Head of the School of Law from 2009-2012. He previously\u000d\u000a      lectured at Brunel University and the University of the West of England,\u000d\u000a      prior to which he practiced law in Nigeria as a barrister and solicitor of\u000d\u000a      the Supreme Court.\u000d\u000a    Since completing his PhD in 2001, Baderin has produced an extensive body\u000d\u000a      of work that explores the relationship between Islamic Law and\u000d\u000a      international human rights and how the two might be harmonised. International\u000d\u000a        Human Rights and Islamic Law, for example, published in 2003 and\u000d\u000a      2005, with an updated second edition expected in 2014, asked whether\u000d\u000a      international human rights and Islamic law are compatible, and if it is\u000d\u000a      possible for Muslim states to comply simultaneously with international\u000d\u000a      human rights law and Islamic law.\u000d\u000a    Since his arrival at SOAS in 2007, Baderin developed these ideas in\u000d\u000a      specific contexts and in relation to specific strands of Islamic law (e.g.\u000d\u000a      outputs b and c) to develop their wider impact on human rights practice in\u000d\u000a      Muslim states. For example, a 2013 book chapter, \"Islamic Law and\u000d\u000a      International Protection of Minority Rights in Context\", explores the\u000d\u000a      legal provisions for the protection of minority rights in both Islamic law\u000d\u000a      and international law, with a view to integrating the two. The argument\u000d\u000a      underpinning this research is that, while there are differences between\u000d\u000a      Islamic and international human rights in terms of scope and application,\u000d\u000a      these do not preclude the establishment of a common ground. He proposes\u000d\u000a      that international human rights law engage in active dialogue with Islamic\u000d\u000a      law, in order that the latter becomes a channel through which\u000d\u000a      international human rights law can be progressed, enforced and guaranteed\u000d\u000a      in the Islamic world. Baderin's research draws largely on evidence from\u000d\u000a      Islamic jurisprudence and international human rights practice, with\u000d\u000a      frequent use of country-specific examples to support his arguments.\u000d\u000a    Baderin's research constitutes an entirely original contribution to the\u000d\u000a      study of Islamic law and international human rights law. Prior to his\u000d\u000a      path-breaking research, no significant work published in the UK attempted\u000d\u000a      to synthesise international human rights law and Islamic law. Indeed, the\u000d\u000a      widely accepted and largely unchallenged academic perspective on this\u000d\u000a      issue was previously adversarial, particularly in the US, where the two\u000d\u000a      were seen to exist in a permanent opposition. Baderin's work successfully\u000d\u000a      undermines this approach in its proposal that this conflict can be\u000d\u000a      mitigated by positively establishing the concept of international human\u000d\u000a      rights from within the tenets of Islamic law. Owing to this unique\u000d\u000a      harmonising approach, coupled with his persuasive and eminently readable\u000d\u000a      style, Baderin's research and resulting expertise has proved influential\u000d\u000a      and even instrumental to those working in human rights policy and practice\u000d\u000a      in the UK and internationally who wish to transcend the unhelpful\u000d\u000a      dichotomy that has hindered a positive exchange of ideas.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42798","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Recent research conducted by the Iranian and Kurdish Women's Rights\u000d\u000a      Organisation in 2011\u000d\u000a      highlighted the increasing incidence of honour crimes in the UK.

(6) Rehman also\u000d\u000a      began to develop\u000d\u000a      training programmes and materials for the police in 2008 in keeping with\u000d\u000a      these definitions.

(9). More\u000d\u000a      broadly, the CPS guidance\u000d\u000a      presents honour crimes as a class of crimes that represent a fundamental\u000d\u000a      breach of human rights\u000d\u000a      and a manifestation of violence against women that transcends particular\u000d\u000a      cultural mores, stating,\u000d\u000a      \"Such crimes cut across all cultures, nationalities, faith groups and\u000d\u000a      communities.

Beyond\u000d\u000a      chapters in the book,\u000d\u000a      other outputs include freely available electronic resources, including an\u000d\u000a      extensive annotated\u000d\u000a      bibliography, case summaries, a training film on forced marriage in the\u000d\u000a      UK, catalogues of relevant\u000d\u000a      national and international penal codes and human rights provisions and a\u000d\u000a      directory of those\u000d\u000a      working on the topic internationally (http:\/\/www.soas.ac.uk\/honourcrimes\/).\u000d\u000a    Professor Welchman's contributions focussed on the legal status of honour\u000d\u000a      crimes in several\u000d\u000a      jurisdictions, mainly in the Middle East. More specifically, she examined\u000d\u000a      how the law and its\u000d\u000a      application can either provide a justificatory framework and judicial\u000d\u000a      leniency for those who commit\u000d\u000a      honour crimes or work towards deterring the commission of honour crimes\u000d\u000a      and punishing\u000d\u000a      perpetrators on an equitable basis. How the law can actively combat honour\u000d\u000a      crimes was also a\u000d\u000a      significant component of the research.\u000d\u000a    Also significant was the development of a definition of `honour crimes'\u000d\u000a      that was straightforward but\u000d\u000a      flexible enough to accommodate the diversity of honour crimes and the\u000d\u000a      complexity of circumstance\u000d\u000a      and belief that surround their commission. The lack of such a definition\u000d\u000a      highlighted the\u000d\u000a      opportunities available to the project to make significant and fundamental\u000d\u000a      contributions to the\u000d\u000a      research base.\u000d\u000a    At a two-day roundtable in November 1999 participants, including\u000d\u000a      scholars, lawyers, journalists\u000d\u000a      and human rights advocates working in the UK, South Asia and the Middle\u000d\u000a      East identified the\u000d\u000a      following elements discussed in Professor Welchman and Sara Hossain's\u000d\u000a      important Introduction to\u000d\u000a      the book:\u000d\u000a    The term `crimes of honour' (...) encompass[es] a variety of\u000d\u000a        manifestations of violence\u000d\u000a        against women, including `honour killings', assault, confinement or\u000d\u000a        imprisonment, and\u000d\u000a        interference with choice in marriage, where the publicly articulated\u000d\u000a        `justification' is\u000d\u000a        attributed to a social order claimed to require the preservation of a\u000d\u000a        concept of `honour'\u000d\u000a        vested in male (family and\/or conjugal) control over women and\u000d\u000a        specifically women's\u000d\u000a        sexual conduct: actual, suspected or potential.\u000d\u000a    Crucially, this definition situates honour crimes along a wider spectrum\u000d\u000a      of violence against women,\u000d\u000a      in line with the position adopted by the UN the same year, thereby fixing\u000d\u000a      honour crimes within the\u000d\u000a      scope of international human rights law and advocacy. Defining honour\u000d\u000a      crimes in this way remains\u000d\u000a      contested by several countries and by some advocacy groups that promulgate\u000d\u000a      a view stressing the\u000d\u000a      exceptionalism of honour crimes. Nevertheless, it is this definition and\u000d\u000a      the research that underpins\u000d\u000a      it that have influenced the responses of public-facing statutory services\u000d\u000a      in the UK and beyond.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43351","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The book has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on the\u000a      interpretation and application\u000a      of the Hague Convention on Child Abduction by courts in various countries\u000a      in the world including,\u000a      unusually, civil law and mixed legal systems eg Germany (Supreme\u000a      Court, Bundesgerichtshof,\u000a      XII Zivilsenat Decision of 16 August 2000, BGHZ 145), Quebec (Court of\u000a      Appeal, F.(R.) v G.

The book's treatment of \"settled\" has also been\u000a      influential in some\u000a      decisions of US state courts of appeal, see the Court of Appeal of\u000a      California in Esquivelzeta v\u000a      Sohn, 2013 Cal.

Finally for the US, the book\u000a      continues to be cited\u000a      positively in first instance decisions on child abduction, often due to\u000a      its extensive citation in earlier\u000a      decisions of higher courts like Mozes, above, and Gitter v\u000a      Gitter (2nd Cir. 2005) 396 F. 3d 124, eg in\u000a      Headifen v Harker, 2013 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 104044, judgment of 20 July 2012.\u000a    The view that the book is the \"leading treatise\" on the Convention has\u000a      recently been reiterated by\u000a      several courts in Australia in the course of giving significant\u000a      weight to a variety of points made in\u000a      the book (see the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia in Harris\u000a      v Harris [2010] FamCAFC\u000a      221, paras. 33, 35 and 152 and in Zotkiewicz v Commissioner of\u000a        Police (No.2) [2011] FamCAFC\u000a      147, paras. 80-82 and104; Bennett J in the Family Court of Australia in State\u000a        Central Authority and\u000a        Camden (No 2) [2011] FamCA 666, para. 117; and by the Family Court\u000a      of Western Australia in\u000a      Soysa and Commissioner, Western Australia Police [2012] FCWA 28,\u000a      paras. 153-156).\u000a    In Canada the Ontario Court of Appeal has placed reliance on the\u000a      book in several cases including\u000a      (Jackson v Graczyk, 2007 ONCA 388, paras. 3-39; Cannock\u000a      v Fleguel, 2008 ONCA 758, para. 26;\u000a      and Ellis v Wentzell-Ellis, 2010 ONCA 347, para. 20) and\u000a      the British Columbia Court of Appeal\u000a      made significant use of the book in Kubera v Kubera, 2010\u000a      BCCA 118, paras. 38 and 90, to give a\u000a      balanced construction on the meaning of \"settled\" and other matters in\u000a      Article 12 of the\u000a      Convention.\u000a    The book has been cited by the highest courts in Australia, New\u000a        Zealand and the UK (DP v\u000a      Commonwealth Central Authority [2001] HCA 39, paras. 35, 38, 84,\u000a      102, 124, and 125; Secretary\u000a        for Justice v HJ [2006] NZSC 97 at footnotes 93, 103 and\u000a      104; In re M and another (Children)\u000a        (Abduction: Rights of Custody) [2008] 1 A.C. 1288, para. 22; In\u000a        re E (Children) (FC) [2011] UKSC\u000a      27; [2012] 1 AC 144 in the judgment of the Court given by Lady Hale and\u000a      Lord Wilson, para. 6).\u000a      Again, the earlier cases, as leading authorities, have been influential in\u000a      the development of the\u000a      jurisprudence in these countries in the REF census period (see, for\u000a      example, the Australian\u000a      decisions above and the English and New Zealand decisions below).\u000a    The book has also been cited by the English Court of Appeal in Re W\u000a        (Minors) [2010] EWCA Civ\u000a      520, para. 17 (cited in turn by Cobb J in LCG v RL [2013]\u000a      EWHC 1383 (Fam), para. 79), by the\u000a      Irish High Court in P v P [2012] IEHC 31, para. 29, by the\u000a      New Zealand Court of Appeal in C v H\u000a      [2009] NZCA 100, para. 25 and by the New Zealand High Court on appeal in RCL\u000a      v APBL [2012]\u000a      NZHC 1292, para. 96.\u000a    One specific example of a judge being influenced by the book to give an\u000a      interpretation that widens\u000a      the application of the Convention by giving a later date to when a\u000a      `wrongful retention' takes place\u000a      and thereby protecting the rights of left behind parents to get their\u000a      child back is RS v KS, LS (By\u000a        his Guardian Marion Werner-Jones) [2009] EWHC 1494 (Fam): [2010] 1\u000a      FCR 338. Macur J said:\u000a    \"37 In that [case Wall J] decided as a matter of law that an intention\u000a        to wrongfully retain does not\u000a        have to be communicated to the left behind parent\/custodian in word or\u000a        deed for the purpose of the\u000a        twelve month period which triggers a prospective exception to summary\u000a        return on the basis of\u000a        `settlement', I respectfully disagree. I adopt the argument of Beaumont\u000a        and McEleavy, in The\u000a        Hague Convention on International Child Abduction at page 41, that this\u000a        approach would \"threaten\u000a        certainty\" and \"penalise an applicant by commencing the limitation\u000a        period before he could [or, I\u000a        insert, should] have been aware that his rights had been breached.\"\"\u000a    In the first case on the Hague Child Abduction Convention to be heard by\u000a      the US Supreme Court,\u000a      Abbott v Abbott, 130 S. Ct. 1983 (2010) the petition for a\u000a      writ of certiorari contained references to\u000a      arguments from the book on pages 29-30. This case was an attempt to get a\u000a      uniform\u000a      interpretation of Article 5 of the Convention on the important point that\u000a      a person who simply has a\u000a      right to object to a child leaving a country has a custody right for the\u000a      purposes of the Convention\u000a      and can get his or her child back under the Convention if the child is\u000a      removed from one Contracting\u000a      State to another without that person's consent (or authorisation of a\u000a      court in that country). The\u000a      book argued in favour of this interpretation at a time when views were\u000a      divided and this has helped\u000a      push the argument in favour of this approach in the courts of several\u000a      countries that have analysed\u000a      the issue (eg Australia, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa,\u000a      Switzerland and the UK)\u000a      and was the view adopted by the majority of the US Supreme Court in Abbott.\u000a    As of 26 July 2013 the Convention is in force in 90 States in the world,\u000a      see above.

The book has been cited by leading courts in Australia, Canada,\u000a      Germany, Hong Kong,\u000a      Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the UK and the USA as a leading\u000a      authority on the\u000a      interpretation of the Hague Child Abduction Convention 1980. The\u000a      Convention was concluded in\u000a      1980 and as at 26 July 2013 is in force in 90 States. At the time the book\u000a      was written there were 51\u000a      State parties to the Convention. As the only comprehensive monograph in\u000a      English on the\u000a      Convention, it seems reasonable to claim that it has assisted in widening\u000a      its ratification. The\u000a      Convention is one of the most successful private international law\u000a      treaties in history and seeks to\u000a      reduce the suffering caused by the wrongful removal\/retention (the legal\u000a      terms for abduction) of\u000a      children away from the country of their habitual residence. In particular\u000a      the book has helped to lead\u000a      to judicial decisions favouring a wide interpretation of \"custody rights\"\u000a      and a late date for \"wrongful\u000a      retention\" thereby increasing the number of children covered by the\u000a      Convention. These children\u000a      will usually be returned by the authorities in the country to which they\u000a      have been abducted to the\u000a      country in which they were habitually resident before the abduction. The\u000a      book has also helped\u000a      judges in several countries to arrive at their decisions on the meaning of\u000a      \"settled\" under Article 12\u000a      of the Convention preventing too many returns of children in cases where a\u000a      summary return is not\u000a      possible because the Convention return proceedings were not launched\u000a      within one year of the\u000a      abduction.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Aberdeen\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Aberdeen (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Aberdeen","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007783}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"5332921","Name":"California"},{"GeoNamesId":"2653883","Name":"Cannock"},{"GeoNamesId":"4155751","Name":"Florida"},{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"},{"GeoNamesId":"6093943","Name":"Ontario"},{"GeoNamesId":"6115047","Name":"Québec"},{"GeoNamesId":"5909050","Name":"British Columbia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1819729","Name":"Hong Kong"},{"GeoNamesId":"2058645","Name":"State of Western Australia"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000aPaul Beaumont and Peter McEleavy, The Hague Convention on\u000a        International Child Abduction\u000a      (1999, Oxford University Press).\u000a    \u000a","ResearchSubjectAreas":[{"Level1":"18","Level2":"1","Subject":"Law"},{"Level1":"11","Level2":"17","Subject":"Public Health and Health Services"},{"Level1":"16","Level2":"8","Subject":"Sociology"}],"Sources":"\u000a    1.

The book was the idea of Beaumont. He\u000a      was approached by\u000a      Peter Carter, Wadham College, Oxford University to see if he would offer a\u000a      book in the new OUP\u000a      series of Monographs on Private International Law of which Carter was the\u000a      Series Editor.\u000a      Beaumont had been teaching and researching on the Convention for a number\u000a      of years and had\u000a      identified the need for a thoroughly researched monograph on the subject.\u000a      OUP indicated that they\u000a      would be interested in this and Beaumont decided that he could best\u000a      achieve this by recruiting a\u000a      PhD student to work with him in producing the book. Beaumont obtained\u000a      funding from the\u000a      University of Aberdeen Research Committee in 1994 to fund a 3 year full\u000a      cost PhD studentship\u000a      with a view to the student (McEleavy, who had studied in Surrey and was\u000a      granted the studentship\u000a      after a publicly advertised process) and Beaumont (Professor from 1 April\u000a      1995) co-authoring a\u000a      book with OUP once the student had completed the PhD (which he did at the\u000a      first attempt in 1998\u000a      with no corrections under the external examinership of Sir Peter North,\u000a      Oxford University). The\u000a      University provided funding for McEleavy to work in the University in 1998\u000a      as a research fellow\u000a      after he completed his PhD in order that he and Beaumont could prepare the\u000a      monograph for OUP\u000a      on the topic. The original research conducted by McEleavy for the PhD,\u000a      under the supervision and\u000a      direction of Beaumont, involved painstaking analysis of all the travaux\u000a        pr&#233;paratoires of the\u000a      Convention, of all the then academic writings on the Convention, all the\u000a      case law in the English\u000a      and French speaking worlds (the two official languages of the Convention)\u000a      and some interviews\u000a      with key drafters of the Convention (eg Adair Dyer, formerly of the\u000a      Permanent Bureau of the Hague\u000a      Conference on Private International Law, who was the official who oversaw\u000a      the drafting of the\u000a      Convention and Professor Sandy Anton who was the Chairman of the Special\u000a      and Diplomatic\u000a      Sessions in The Hague that drafted and concluded the Convention and who at\u000a      the time of the\u000a      research was an Honorary Professor in this Law School). The book drew on\u000a      McEleavy's PhD\u000a      which had been influenced by Beaumont's insights but did not use parts of\u000a      the PhD and added\u000a      various new elements at the instigation of Beaumont (for example, chapter\u000a      14 on interpretation).\u000a      The book did not simply explain the historical development of the\u000a      Convention and describe the\u000a      leading case law on it but also carefully analysed each provision giving a\u000a      view as to how it should\u000a      be interpreted and concluding with suggestions for reform. It took full\u000a      account of the changed\u000a      sociological position from the time of the drafting of the Convention,\u000a      whereby most abductions\u000a      were by then (and still are) committed by primary carer mothers rather\u000a      than non-primary carer\u000a      fathers, and of the increased rights of children brought about by the UN\u000a      Convention on the Rights\u000a      of the Child. The suggestions for reform in the conclusions (pages\u000a      261-266) are sensitive to the\u000a      need to preserve the Child Abduction Convention as a quick summary return\u000a      mechanism while, as\u000a      far as possible, avoiding harm to the children involved and being fair to\u000a      the parents. The final\u000a      version of the book was one that fully reflected the views of both of the\u000a      authors and benefited from\u000a      the knowledge, research and insights of both authors in relation to the\u000a      Convention.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43352","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The main impact of the case trajectories research since 2008 has been on\u000a      the Criminal\u000a      Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007, most of which came into\u000a      effect in 2008, and the\u000a      Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010, implemented in\u000a      2010 and 2011. The influence\u000a      of the research is best described chronologically.\u000a    The evaluation of the fiscal fine as means of diverting cases from the\u000a      criminal courts to shorten\u000a      `case trajectories' and reduce court workloads showed that this system\u000a      worked well (pub 1). This\u000a      study was drawn on extensively when the fiscal fine system was expanded in\u000a      1996 by increasing it\u000a      from &#163;25 to a maximum of &#163;100 by legislation in 1996. The Summary\u000a        Justice Review Committee,\u000a      of which Duff was a member, returned to this topic in 2002-2004,and as\u000a      result of Duff's earlier\u000a      comparative research on prosecutor fines (pub 4), visited the\u000a      Netherlands (paras 1.13, 11.20) to\u000a      see how the more ambitious Dutch \"transaction\" worked. The Committee\u000a      recommended a further\u000a      increase in the maximum fiscal fine (to &#163;500) and suggested that, as in\u000a      the Netherlands, courts\u000a      should be made aware of previous fiscal fines offered to the accused. It\u000a      also recommended that\u000a      the system should be changed from one of \"opt in\" to \"opt out\" (ie the\u000a      fiscal fine is deemed to have\u000a      been accepted unless the recipient expressly refuses it), mainly because\u000a      of the findings in the\u000a      Aberdeen research (pub 1) that a significant proportion of court\u000a      workloads involved unanswered\u000a      offers of fiscal fines where the recipient had no intention of disputing\u000a      guilt (paras 7. 37-38 and\u000a      footnote 29). On March 10th 2008, the Criminal\u000a      Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007, s 50\u000a      (amending s 302 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995) implemented\u000a      these changes.\u000a      According to the Crown Office figures, the number of cases disposed of by\u000a      fiscal fine immediately\u000a      increased from 18,922 in 2007-8 to 36,903 in 2008-9 and reached 41,196 by\u000a      2011-12. The\u000a      number of cases going to court dropped from 127,418 in 2007-8 to 118,867\u000a      in 2008-9 and to\u000a      101,606 by 2011-12, Thus, the reforms to the prosecutor fine in 2008, in\u000a      which the work carried out\u000a      at Aberdeen was influential, have had a major impact on the trajectories\u000a      of criminal cases.\u000a    Aberdeen scholars' research on adjournments and pre-trial hearings\u000a      confirmed the need to secure\u000a      early disclosure of evidence by the prosecution to the defence as means of\u000a      shortening \"case\u000a      trajectories\" (pubs 2,3). The Privy Council's \"revolutionary\"\u000a      decision in Holland and Sinclair (see\u000a      above) meant that there was an urgent need to create a new\u000a      disclosure regime in Scotland which\u000a      would be compliant with the ECHR. The Government saw this as an\u000a      opportunity also to encourage\u000a      prompt disclosure, both to encourage early guilty pleas and reduce\u000a      pre-trial adjournments as a\u000a      result of late disclosure by the prosecution. A new statutory regime was\u000a      set out in 2009 in the\u000a      Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill. As a result of Duff's\u000a      publications on disclosure and\u000a      criminal justice, he was appointed as adviser to the Scottish Parliament's\u000a      Justice Committee at\u000a      Stage 1 of the Bill. The task involved the analysis of written evidence\u000a      submitted to the Committee,\u000a      advising MSPs what questions to ask of witnesses who gave oral evidence\u000a      before the Committee\u000a      and attending such sessions to advise the MSPs. The Justice Committee's\u000a      Stage 1 Report on the\u000a      Bill was published on 12th November 2009 (Scottish\u000a      Parliament Paper 334). Ultimately, Part 6 of\u000a      the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 implemented\u000a      the new disclosure scheme\u000a      which is now in force and has led to changes in prosecution practice (see\u000a      COPFS Disclosure\u000a      Manual 9th edition, Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service,\u000a      June 2011).\u000a    As a result of Duff's research and publications, he was asked to join a\u000a      research team to evaluate\u000a      the new statutory disclosure regime's effect on \"case trajectories\". The\u000a      project was led by the\u000a      Scottish Centre for Social Research and won the competitive tender to\u000a      secure the Scottish\u000a      Government funding.

It found that, as a result of increased disclosure, there was an\u000a      increase in the proportion\u000a      of accused pleading guilty at an early stage. There was some evidence that\u000a      the extent, quality and\u000a      speed of disclosure varied across different police forces and prosecution\u000a      offices. Delays in the\u000a      disclosure of CCTV evidence, forensic reports and full witness statements\u000a      were commonplace.\u000a      These findings will inevitably result in further adjustments by the police\u000a      and Crown Office to\u000a      increase the efficiency of the new regime.\u000a    Duff's published research on disclosure in both practitioner (SLT &#8212; see\u000a      above) and academic\u000a      journals (pub 6) also led to him being invited to conduct various\u000a      training sessions for sheriffs and\u000a      High Court judges, around 20 attending each session, on the new provisions\u000a      at the request of the\u000a      Judicial Studies Committee, which is responsible for judicial training in\u000a      Scotland (6th Oct 2009, 24th\u000a      Nov 2009, 1st Feb 2010, and 31st May\u000a      2010).

These\u000a      empirical studies have been associated with more theoretical work on \"case\u000a      trajectories\", which\u000a      has looked at different solutions to problems of delay in different\u000a      jurisdictions and how they relate\u000a      to different analytical models of the criminal justice process, in\u000a      particular the \"adversarial\" and\u000a      \"inquisitorial\" systems. For instance, the Government funded evaluation of\u000a      the introduction to\u000a      Scotland of \"fiscal\" (prosecutor) fines (pub 1) led Duff to examine\u000a      the origins and use of prosecutor\u000a      fines in the inquisitorial systems of continental Europe. The prosecutor\u000a      fine allows prosecutors to\u000a      divert minor cases from the court process with a consequent reduction in\u000a      court workloads and\u000a      hence, policy makers hope, fewer delays in case completion. Duff did\u000a      empirical work upon the\u000a      extensive use of the \"transaction\" (a prosecutor fine) in the Netherlands\u000a      by Dutch prosecutors and\u000a      the theoretical implications of such an \"administrative\" approach to\u000a      criminal justice (pub 4).\u000a    Similarly, the Law School's Scottish Government funded research on\u000a      adjournments, pre-trial\u000a      hearings and the agreement of evidence in criminal cases emphasised the\u000a      need for early\u000a      disclosure of evidence by the prosecution to the defence (pubs 2,3,5).\u000a      It has frequently been\u000a      argued by Scottish (and other) policy makers that early disclosure of the\u000a      prosecution's evidence to\u000a      the defence will lead to an increase in early guilty pleas, because the\u000a      accused will see the strength\u000a      of the evidence against him. Thus, \"case trajectories\" will be shortened.\u000a      In theoretical terms,\u000a      however, the lack of disclosure, whether early or late, is a hall-mark of\u000a      adversarial procedure and\u000a      to require disclosure of the prosecution evidence to the defence arguably\u000a      shifts Scottish criminal\u000a      procedure towards the inquisitorial models of the Continent, where early\u000a      disclosure has long been\u000a      routine (pub 6). Further, policy makers and legal practitioners\u000a      have suggested that the practical\u000a      effects of early disclosure can be greatly increased by \"sentence\u000a      discounting\" (ie reducing\u000a      sentences in return for early pleas), an argument which was borne out by\u000a      the above research\u000a      carried out by the Aberdeen Law School. Sentence discounting causes much\u000a      controversy in\u000a      academic circles and Leverick (Senior Lecturer) published a theoretical\u000a      article on this topic while\u000a      still at Aberdeen (pub 7). As regards the disclosure debate, the\u000a      Privy Council's ground-breaking\u000a      decision in Holland and Sinclair v HMA 2005 SC(PC) 3, 28, made\u000a      reform a matter of urgency, and\u000a      Duff has commented on the issue in practitioner titles (\"Sinclair and\u000a      Holland: A revolution in\u000a      disclosure\", 2005 SLT(News) 105-111; \"Dislosure, PII and the\u000a      confidentiality of personal records\",\u000a      2010 SLT(News) 181-184) and academic journals (pub 6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43462","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The UK has long suffered an under-supply of donated organs capable of\u000d\u000a      transplantation. In 2008, the waiting list for transplants numbered over\u000d\u000a      8,000 people. It was estimated that, at a minimum, an additional 50% of\u000d\u000a      donations would be required to meet existing needs. The human costs of\u000d\u000a      unmet need are extremely high. In 2007\/08, for example, approximately\u000d\u000a      1,000 people on the waiting list died from lack of available transplant\u000d\u000a      organs [Source 2: page 6, para 2.2].\u000d\u000a    In light of this need, the UK Organ Donation Taskforce was established in\u000d\u000a      2006 to identify barriers to organ donation and to make appropriate policy\u000d\u000a      recommendations to remedy the deficit. In January 2008 it issued a report\u000d\u000a      that made 14 recommendations for policy change [Source 1]. However,\u000d\u000a      the preparatory work for this report had not explored policy options that\u000d\u000a      would have required legislative change [Source 2: page 6, para 2.4].\u000a      Consequent to this report, the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, signalled his\u000d\u000a      preference for new legislation introducing an `opt out' system of presumed\u000d\u000a      consent and called for a \"serious debate\" on this option [Source 3].\u000d\u000a      He commissioned the Organ Donation Taskforce to undertake further work:\u000d\u000a      (1) to examine what measures would be required to introduce a `presumed\u000d\u000a      consent' system; (2) to explore the potential impact of presumed consent\u000d\u000a      legislation on organ donation rates in the UK; and (3) to consider public\u000d\u000a      attitudes to presumed consent [Source 2: page 6, para 2.4]. To\u000d\u000a      inform its work in relation to tasks (2) and (3), the Taskforce\u000d\u000a      commissioned the University of York's Centre for Reviews and\u000d\u000a        Dissemination to undertake a systematic review of relevant evidence\u000d\u000a      [Source 2: page 7, para 3.2]. The University of York's findings\u000d\u000a      were presented to the Taskforce in the Spring of 2008.\u000d\u000a    The Taskforce published its final report in November 2008 [Source 2].\u000a      Its overall recommendation was not to legislate for a system of\u000d\u000a      presumed consent, but rather to attempt alternative policy options. It\u000d\u000a      believed that organ donations should be increased without\u000d\u000a      legislation. Not only would such legislation be costly and challenging, it\u000d\u000a      argued, it may also erode public trust in the NHS and government and have\u000d\u000a      a counter-productive effect on organ availability. The Taskforce, in light\u000d\u000a      of the evidence it had received, put forward alternative non-legislative\u000d\u000a      policy options and recommended that the government should wait for a\u000d\u000a      period of 5 years to see if these alternative policy options would prove\u000d\u000a      successful [Source 2: page 37, para 15.7].\u000d\u000a    The research of the University of York was a key feature of the evidence\u000d\u000a      considered in the Taskforce's deliberations and it is clear that the\u000d\u000a      University of York's research had a significant and material impact on the\u000d\u000a      Taskforce's ultimate recommendation. Two of the 15 chapters in its report\u000d\u000a      (chapters 11 and 12) discussed the University of York's findings at some\u000d\u000a      length. The University of York's research findings were also published in\u000d\u000a      full as an annexe to the report (Annexe I). In particular, its conclusion\u000d\u000a      that presumed consent legislation in isolation was unlikely to explain\u000d\u000a      variations in organ donation rates was stressed in the Taskforce's overall\u000d\u000a      summary of its reasoning:\u000d\u000a    Taskforce members had a wide range of views at the outset. However, after\u000d\u000a      examining the evidence, the Taskforce reached a clear consensus in\u000d\u000a      recommending that an opt out system should not be introduced in the UK at\u000d\u000a      the present time. The Taskforce concluded that such a system has the\u000d\u000a      potential to undermine the concept of donation as a gift, to erode trust\u000d\u000a      in the NHS professionals and the Government, and negatively impact on\u000d\u000a      organ donation numbers. It would distract attention away from essential\u000d\u000a      improvements to systems and infrastructure and from the urgent need to\u000d\u000a      improve public awareness and understanding of organ donation. Furthermore,\u000d\u000a      it would be challenging and costly to implement. Most compelling of\u000d\u000a          all, we found no convincing evidence that it would deliver\u000d\u000a        significant increases in the number of donated organs. (emphasis\u000d\u000a      added) [Source 2: page 34, para 15.2]\u000d\u000a    On the publication of the Taskforce's report in November 2008, Gordon\u000d\u000a      Brown accepted its recommendation and abandoned his preferred option of\u000d\u000a      legislating for a presumed consent system. He conceded that a voluntary\u000d\u000a      system should be given a period of 5 years to prove its effectiveness [Sources\u000d\u000a        4]. Speaking at No. 10 Downing Street, he noted,\u000d\u000a    \"... they are not recommending the introduction of a presumed consent\u000d\u000a      system, as I have done ... The proposal is that we double the number of\u000d\u000a      volunteers to 50%. If we can't get there quickly we will return to the\u000d\u000a      proposal.\" [Source 5]\u000d\u000a    The target of increasing the numbers of organ donations within 5 years\u000d\u000a      without legislation was, in fact, achieved. NHS Blood and Transplant\u000d\u000a      reported in April 2013 that:\u000d\u000a    More than 3,100 lives were transformed by deceased donors in the last 12\u000d\u000a      months as the NHS hit the 50% increase in deceased organ donation, the\u000d\u000a      challenge set by the Organ Donation Taskforce in 2008... The number of\u000d\u000a      deceased organ donors across the UK in 2012\/13 hit 1212, representing a\u000d\u000a      50% increase since 2007\/08 when the four UK governments accepted the\u000d\u000a      recommendations of the 2008 Organ Donation Taskforce. There had been\u000d\u000a      almost no increase in the number of deceased donors over the previous\u000d\u000a      decade. [Source 6]\u000d\u000a    The University of York's research, accordingly, contributed substantially\u000d\u000a      to the Taskforce's recommendations which, in turn, had the following\u000d\u000a      highly significant impacts:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      A change in national policy direction on the part of the Prime\u000d\u000a        Minister\u000d\u000a      The prevention of a radical and costly alteration to the UK's\u000d\u000a        voluntary system of transplant organ provision\u000d\u000a      The avoidance of the potential corrosion of public trust in the NHS\u000d\u000a        and Government\u000d\u000a      A successful 50% increase in organ donations, thereby setting the UK\u000d\u000a        agenda for future organ donation policy\u000d\u000a      Corresponding life-saving benefits enjoyed by the recipients of the\u000d\u000a        additional donated organs.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Until recently, there have been insufficient organs for transplantation\u000d\u000a      in the UK. In 2008, the Prime Minister (Gordon Brown) signalled that, in\u000d\u000a      order to remedy this shortfall, he favoured legislating for a system\u000d\u000a      whereby everyone would be legally presumed to have consented to the\u000d\u000a      `donation' of their organs on death (unless one opted out). Brown\u000d\u000a      commissioned the Organ Donation Taskforce to explore the potential impact\u000d\u000a      of presumed consent legislation on organ `donation' rates. The Taskforce,\u000d\u000a      in turn, commissioned the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at\u000d\u000a      the University of York to conduct a systematic review of the international\u000d\u000a      evidence. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination has developed\u000d\u000a      particular research expertise in the conduct of systematic reviews &#8212; an\u000d\u000a      established scientific methodology for the conduct of meta-analyses of\u000d\u000a      datasets. The Centre's research findings, in the published view of the\u000d\u000a      Taskforce, provided the \"most compelling\" argument against a\u000d\u000a      legislative change. The Taskforce ultimately argued that a system of\u000d\u000a      `presumed consent' may actually have a negative effect on donation rates\u000d\u000a      and may erode public trust in the NHS and Government. The alternative\u000d\u000a      policy option it proposed would not only be more effective, it argued, but\u000d\u000a      would avoid any negative side-effects of a `presumed consent' system.\u000d\u000a      Gordon Brown reluctantly accepted this recommendation and abandoned his\u000d\u000a      legislative proposal so that the alternative policy option could be given\u000d\u000a      time to prove its effectiveness. In 2013, this alternative voluntary\u000d\u000a      system succeeded in meeting its target of increased donations. In this\u000d\u000a      way, a 50% national increase in life-saving organ donations was achieved,\u000d\u000a      while a costly and challenging legislative system with its potential\u000d\u000a      erosion of public trust was avoided.

The commissioned research\u000d\u000a      comprised a systematic review of evidence relating to a specific legal\u000d\u000a      issue: the notion of presumed consent to organ transplantation after\u000d\u000a      death. The research project focused on two key empirical questions about\u000d\u000a      this legal phenomenon: (1) in countries which have legislated to render\u000d\u000a      such consent presumed, what impact has the legislation had on organ\u000d\u000a      `donation' rates? and (2) what are the attitudes of the public,\u000d\u000a      professionals and other stakeholders to presumed consent legislation? The\u000d\u000a      systematic review examined a total of 26 studies and public opinion\u000d\u000a      surveys from across the world in response to these core research\u000d\u000a      questions.\u000d\u000a    On the question of the impact of presumed consent (`opt out')\u000d\u000a      legislation, the project team found five in-country studies that had\u000d\u000a      compared donation rates before and after the introduction of legislation.\u000d\u000a      These reported an increase in donation rates after the introduction of\u000d\u000a      presumed consent legislation. However, they had conducted little\u000d\u000a      investigation of any other changes taking place concurrently with the\u000d\u000a      change in legislation and so were unable to locate legislative impact\u000d\u000a      against the backdrop of other potentially significant contextual factors.\u000d\u000a      This weakness was emphasised by the between-country studies examined. They\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that additional factors were associated with an increase in\u000d\u000a      donation rates. In the four best quality between-country comparisons,\u000d\u000a      although presumed consent legislation was associated with increased organ\u000d\u000a      donation, other factors were also found to be important: (a) the\u000d\u000a      common\/civil law nature of the legal system, (b) public access to\u000d\u000a      information, (c) mortality from road traffic accidents and cerebrovascular\u000d\u000a      causes, (d) transplant capacity, (e) gross domestic product per capita,\u000d\u000a      (f) health expenditure per capita, (g) religion and (h) education.\u000d\u000a      Ultimately, the review concluded that presumed consent legislation in\u000d\u000a      isolation was unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates\u000d\u000a      between different countries:\u000d\u000a    A combination of legislation, availability of donors, transplantation\u000d\u000a      system organisation and infrastructure, wealth and investment in\u000d\u000a      healthcare, as well as underlying public attitudes to and awareness of\u000d\u000a      organ donation and transplantation may all play a role (Rithalia et al,\u000d\u000a      2009, p. 39)\u000d\u000a    On the question of underlying attitudes to presumed consent legislation,\u000d\u000a      thirteen surveys of public and professional attitudes to presumed consent\u000d\u000a      were identified. Eight of these explored the attitudes of the UK public.\u000d\u000a      The UK public opinion surveys showed support for presumed consent law but\u000d\u000a      with variation in the levels of support. The project team concluded that\u000d\u000a      the variation in results may have reflected differences in survey methods.\u000d\u000a      Although recent UK surveys indicated support for a presumed consent\u000d\u000a      system, the team ultimately concluded that it was inappropriate on the\u000d\u000a      basis of existing evidence to draw any overall conclusions about public\u000d\u000a      views in the UK.\u000d\u000a    Of the authors, Rithalia, McDaid, Suekarran, and Norman were employed as\u000d\u000a      Research Fellows by the University of York at the time of the research.\u000d\u000a      Myers held the position of Information Specialist, and Sowden held the\u000d\u000a      position of Deputy Director of the Centre for Reviews and\u000d\u000a        Dissemination.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43463","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Skinner's research has had two primary impacts. First, it influenced the\u000a      radical re-design of the\u000a      child support system through the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act\u000a      2008. Second, it\u000a      informed further reforms made to this system under the Welfare Reform Act\u000a      2012. These impacts\u000a      occurred by way of three different methods:\u000a    Method 1: Establishing a foundational principle for policy re-design\u000a    The Child Support Act 1991 is widely regarded as having been a major\u000a      policy failure. In 1999\u000a      Skinner (with Bradshaw, Stimson and Williams) published research with a\u000a      key finding that became\u000a      a foundational principle in the subsequent re-design of the system.\u000a      Skinner and colleagues\u000a      demonstrated convincingly that the Child Support Act was failing, in large\u000a      part, due to its failure to\u000a      recognise the deep connections between non-resident fathers' financial\u000a      commitments to their\u000a      children and their social and emotional bonds with those children. The\u000a      core finding that later\u000a      provided the foundation for the radical re-design of the Child Support\u000a      System was as follows:\u000a    \"The results of this research show that no child support scheme has a\u000a      prospect of success\u000a      unless it is based on negotiation between the parents, which is recognised\u000a      as fair, and the\u000a      perception of fairness on the fathers' part depends more than anything on\u000a      their ability (and the\u000a      former partners' willingness) to have shared parental responsibility for\u000a      their children... What is\u000a      needed is a service that enables these fathers and mothers to work out\u000a      arrangements for child\u000a      support, contact and other matters that concern them.\" (1999: 249)\u000a    This core finding was acknowledged and confirmed two years later by\u000a      research commissioned by\u000a      the Department for Work and Pensions. Referring to the summary of findings\u000a      of the ESRC's\u000a      Population and Household Change Programme [Source 1, p. 108],\u000a      Wikeley et al reiterated the\u000a      York research's basic message that negotiation between the parents that is\u000a      recognised by them as\u000a      being fair is crucial to rates of compliance with child support law\u000a      [Source 1, pp, 107; 159; 161]. This\u000a      principle became central to the eventual re-design of the system. Although\u000a      it took until 2006 for the\u000a      Government to signal that it was ready for radical reform, the report that\u000a      set out the re-design\u000a      recommendations focused centrally on the core message that parents should\u000a      be able to take\u000a      responsibility for making their own arrangements. Citing Wikeley et al\u000a      (who, in turn, had cited the\u000a      York research), Sir David Henshaw stated:\u000a    \"Parents who are able to should be encouraged and supported to make their\u000a      own arrangements.\u000a      Such arrangements tend to result in higher satisfaction and compliance and\u000a      allow individual\u000a      circumstances to be reflected.\" [Source 2: p. 5]\u000a    This core principle was then carried into the Government's White Paper:\u000a    \"The Government has accepted Sir David's principal recommendations. Based\u000a      on these it has\u000a      established four new principles for the reform of the child maintenance\u000a      system, [the second of\u000a      which is to] ... promote parental responsibility by encouraging and\u000a      empowering parents\u000a      to2028 make their own maintenance arrangements wherever possible...\"\u000a      [Source 3, p. 6]\u000a    The new child support system was eventually introduced through the Child\u000a      Maintenance and Other\u000a      Payments Act 2008. It reflected the core message of the original York\u000a      research, embedding the\u000a      principle of promoting and supporting parental arrangements about child\u000a      maintenance.\u000a    Method 2: Commissioned Research Feeding Directly into Policy Change\u000a    Skinner also conducted two further research projects that had been\u000a      commissioned by policy\u000a      makers directly to inform policy design and development. The first of\u000a      these &#8212; a comparison of child\u000a      maintenance systems in 14 countries &#8212; was commissioned in 2006 by the\u000a      Department for Work\u000a      and Pensions to help it undertake the \"far-reaching and ambitious\"\u000a      re-design of the child support\u000a      system [Source 5, p. 5]. The significance of the York research report to\u000a      the proposed re-design of\u000a      the system was noted in the Government's summary of responses to its\u000a      consultation:\u000a    \"The report [by Skinner and colleagues] illustrated how the UK's child\u000a      maintenance system\u000a      performs in an international context and drew out potential lessons and\u000a      policy implications\u000a      across areas such as private maintenance arrangements, enforcement,\u000a      administration, and\u000a      the disregard of child maintenance payments in benefits calculations.\"\u000a      [Source 5, p 90]\u000a    The second research project was commissioned in 2009 by the new agency\u000a      that had by then\u000a      replaced the Child Support Agency. The Child Maintenance and Enforcement\u000a      Commission asked a\u000a      research team from PriceWaterhouseCooper (including Skinner as the\u000a      academic consultant) to\u000a      undertake research that would help it understand the behaviour of parents\u000a      with no formal child\u000a      maintenance arrangements in place. This research helped the Government\u000a      understand how more\u000a      parents could be encouraged to make private agreements. It recommended a\u000a      range of supportive\u000a      services that tackled separated family relationships and the practical and\u000a      emotional consequences\u000a      of relationship breakdown. In January 2011 the new coalition Government\u000a      published a Green\u000a      Paper with proposals to further strengthen the new child support system:\u000a    \"Central to our approach to reform is an integrated model of relationship\u000a      and family support\u000a      services, which helps parents make their own, lasting arrangements.\"\u000a      [Source 8, p. 5]\u000a    The Government cited Skinner's research in its response to the\u000a      consultation submissions [source\u000a      9, pp. 1, 14, &amp; 17], and in the Minister's public discussion of the\u000a      proposals [source 10]. In 2012, the\u000a      government's proposals were legislated through the Welfare Reform Act. The\u000a      new policy\u000a      framework gave due recognition to the complex range of needs with which\u000a      separating parents may\u000a      require help before they can focus upon making child maintenance\u000a      arrangements. Five new\u000a      `Supporting Separated Family Guides' were produced to offer this support\u000a      and advice to separating\u000a      parents. On the last page of each of these guides it is noted that the\u000a      main sources of research\u000a      used to write them included Skinner's work with PriceWaterhouseCooper\u000a      [source 12].\u000a    Method 3: Research Expertise Leading to Academic Consultancies\u000a    In addition to producing excellent research on child maintenance, Skinner\u000a      has also been invited on\u000a      numerous occasions, as a direct result of her research experience and\u000a      expertise, to act as an\u000a      expert consultant.\u000a    \u000a      She was invited to participate in high-level policy seminars organised\u000a        to inform the\u000a        Henshaw review of 2006 and subsequent White Paper. These seminars also\u000a        involved key\u000a        Ministers, the DWP's Director of the Child Support Division responsible\u000a        for the policy redesign, as\u000a        well as other academic experts [sources 3, p. 94; source 5, pp. 10-11,\u000a        para 1.8].\u000a      The House of Commons' Work and Pensions Committee appointed\u000a        Skinner as one of its\u000a        two Specialist Advisors to help it respond to the White Paper proposals\u000a        of 2006 [Source 4, p. 7].\u000a        She helped to set the key recommendations for its report. The Committee\u000a        called on the\u000a        government to introduce holistic support services dealing with all\u000a        aspects of parenting in separated\u000a        families, not just child maintenance obligations.\u000a      Skinner was one of two academic consultants within a research\u000a        consortium commissioned\u000a        by the Department for Work and Pensions to conduct a further national\u000a        survey of separated\u000a        parents' experiences and views concerning child maintenance (Source 7,\u000a        p. 7, fn 6). She assisted\u000a        in the development of the survey instruments and data analysis. She also\u000a        commented on drafts of\u000a        the report. This research confirmed that parents supported private\u000a        agreements, but only if\u000a        supported by effective information and support services. This research\u000a        was relied upon in the\u000a        Green Paper that preceded the 2012 reforms [source 8, p. 20] and cited\u000a        in the response to the\u000a        Green Paper consultations [Source 9, pp. 44, 31]. It also directly\u000a        informed the development of the 5\u000a        new `Supporting Separated Family Guides' (noted above) subsequent to the\u000a        reforms [source 12].\u000a      In 2008, Skinner presented a paper about her research at a private,\u000a        high-level policy\u000a        seminar, chaired by a Minister and attended by the first Chair of the\u000a        new Child Maintenance and\u000a        Enforcement Commission and the Director of the DWP's Child Support\u000a        Division [source 6]. Her\u000a        findings were key in the development of Child Maintenance Options,\u000a        a service offering holistic\u000a        information and support to all separating parents (not just CSA\u000a        clients), helping them to make\u000a        private agreements (http:\/\/www.cmoptions.org).\u000a      In 2011, Skinner was invited by Maria Millar, the Parliamentary Under\u000a        Secretary of State, to\u000a        join a `Family Support Services Steering Group' as an academic expert to\u000a        help inform the reforms\u000a        being developed under the Welfare Reform Act 2012 [source 11].\u000a    \u000a    Conclusion\u000a    Skinner's body of work, by various means, has impacted significantly on a\u000a      radical change in child\u000a      support policy. Equally, it has directly informed the subsequent\u000a      development of a support\u000a      infrastructure to promote the success of the new legal regime. Child\u000a      maintenance obligations are\u000a      now recognised by policy-makers as being intimately interlinked with\u000a      family relationships. This has\u000a      been the consistent message of Skinner's research since the original study\u000a      in 1995.\u000a    However, these primary impacts give way to clear secondary impacts. The\u000a      policy changes\u000a      since 2008 affect all separated parents in the population, not\u000a      just CMEC clients. The agency\u000a      tasked with providing information and support to separating parents (Child\u000a        Maintenance Options)\u000a      estimates that it has already helped one million parents [source 13]. And\u000a      in turn, of course, the\u000a      benefit of those impacts will then be felt by the dependent children of\u000a      non-widowed lone parents\u000a      (estimated at 30% of all UK dependent children). The policy move to\u000a      parental agreements and the\u000a      delivery of new support services are targeted ultimately at the well-being\u000a      of children.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Christine Skinner (submitted under UoA:20 Law) has produced research with\u000a      colleagues over an\u000a      eighteen-year period that has impacted significantly on the development of\u000a      child maintenance law\u000a      and practice throughout the period 2008-13.

The\u000a      ESRC's Population and Household Change Programme funded the first\u000a        project in 1995. A team\u000a      of York researchers, including Skinner (Research Assistant, 1995; PhD\u000a      student 1996-98;\u000a      Research Fellow, 1990-00; Lecturer, 2000-08; Senior Lecturer, 2008 &#8212;\u000a      present), carried out path-breaking\u000a      empirical research on child support. The Child Support Act 1991 had\u000a      introduced a new\u000a      system of child maintenance in 1993. However, the new system had been\u000a      designed without the\u000a      benefit of adequate research on parents' attitudes and behaviour towards\u000a      child maintenance.\u000a      Both the Act itself and its implementation were controversial and\u000a      compliance with the new regime\u000a      was very low. Skinner and her colleagues conducted the first ever national\u000a      survey of 600 non-resident\u000a      fathers, estimating the population size and describing patterns of\u000a      maintenance payments\u000a      and contact arrangements. They also carried out a qualitative study of\u000a      fathers' willingness to\u000a      make maintenance payments. In combination, these studies demonstrated,\u000a      somewhat counter-intuitively,\u000a      that it was because fathers cared about maintaining their role as fathers\u000a      that they\u000a      became reluctant to pay maintenance. The Child Support Act's failure to\u000a      recognise this, they\u000a      argued, was its fundamental flaw. Skinner had sole responsibility for the\u000a      qualitative study of\u000a      fathers' willingness to pay maintenance. Additionally, she (with Bradshaw\u000a      and Stimson) planned\u000a      the survey. Skinner designed the survey sections dealing with child\u000a      maintenance, the Child\u000a      Support Agency, informal financial support, debts and financial\u000a      settlements.\u000a    The Department for Work and Pensions commissioned the second research\u000a        project in\u000a      the run up to its re-design of the child support system. By 2006, the\u000a      Government had signalled\u000a      that it wanted a re-design. Skinner (with York colleagues, Bradshaw and\u000a      Davidson) was lead\u000a      researcher on a comparative project on child maintenance schemes in 14\u000a      countries. This\u000a      research confirmed that private agreements between parents about child\u000a      maintenance were\u000a      advantageous. It also suggested that the UK compared unfavourably with\u000a      other countries in\u000a      terms of the effectiveness and economy of its regime.\u000a    The third project took place following the legislative changes of\u000a      2008. The Department for\u000a      Work and Pensions commissioned PriceWaterhouseCoopers in 2009 to conduct a\u000a      qualitative\u000a      enquiry into willingness to pay child maintenance among 67 parents without\u000a      agreements. Skinner\u000a      acted as a research consultant on this project, advising on research\u000a      design, analysis and findings.\u000a      She also co-authored the final report. This research extended her earlier\u000a      research and confirmed\u000a      its finding that the quality of family relationships is crucial to the\u000a      making of financial commitments\u000a      towards children.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43500","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"2275384","Name":"Liberia"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The protocols Leader has outlined for best negotiating commercial\u000a      interests and human rights\u000a      have been applied to existing and new international investment contracts.\u000a      Leader has provided\u000a      extensive guidance on investment and human rights law for governments\u000a      (including in Uganda\u000a      and the UK) and for NGOs working in this field (including Amnesty\u000a      International and Global\u000a      Witness). Much of this activity is undertaken in his role as Director of\u000a      the Essex Business and\u000a      Human Rights Project (EBHR), a University centre that fosters\u000a      interdisciplinary work on business\u000a      and human rights and offers training and research digests for non-academic\u000a      users. Leader and\u000a      EBHR's impact activities in the REF impact period have been varied, and\u000a      the most notable\u000a      examples are included below.\u000a    BP and Amnesty International\u000a    Leader's Amnesty International paper on the BTC pipeline project (2003)\u000a      attracted the attention\u000a      of BP, which invited Amnesty and Leader to aid their negotiation of\u000a      additional clauses to the BTC\u000a      contract. Using the principles developed in the research, he formulated\u000a      the content of a Human\u000a        Rights Undertaking for the BTC contract and with the support of\u000a      Amnesty International UK\u000a      secured its adoption by BP [corroborated by Amnesty International UK's\u000a      Economic Relations\u000a      Programme Director, source 1]. While the instrument was adopted in 2003,\u000a      new phases in its\u000a      impact have arisen since 2008. The BTC case received significant attention\u000a      from legal\u000a      practitioners and international bodies such as the UN and the\u000a      International Finance Corporation\u000a      (IFC). Leader's meetings with senior officials in Washington DC and his\u000a      contribution to two World\u000a      Bank workshops prompted the UN, IFC, and the World Bank to undertake their\u000a      own research in\u000a      this area. This research included a report published in 2009 and led by\u000a      the UN Secretary-General's\u000a      Special Representative for Business and Human Rights, Professor John\u000a      Ruggie. The\u000a      report entitled, `Stabilization Clauses and Human Rights', was influenced\u000a      by Leader's research\u000a      and as a result covered the details of the BTC case [corroborating source\u000a      2]. This impact has\u000a      also been confirmed by Amnesty International's Head of Business Networks:\u000a    `The significant institutional impacts of which I am aware include:\u000a      1)...Professor John Ruggie,\u000a      published a report [that] drew largely on Professor Leader's analysis. 2)\u000a      ...The interactions\u000a      that Sheldon had with the World Bank and International Finance\u000a      Corporation...has led to\u000a      recognition by the IFC that the interface between investment contracts and\u000a      human rights is a\u000a      significant issue that needs to be addressed. An outcome of this was IFC's\u000a      involvement in\u000a      and co-sponsorship of the research undertaken on this by Professor\u000a      Ruggie's team'\u000a    Economic Relations Programme Director, Amnesty International UK\u000a    The most recent impact of the Undertaking was on the OECD UK\u000a      National Contact Point, which\u000a      in 2011 decided not to uphold complaints made against BP. Their decision\u000a      was partly based on\u000a      the fact that BP had agreed to the Human Rights Undertaking\u000a      drafted and negotiated by Leader\u000a      [corroborating source 3, especially para 27].\u000a    Finally, his work with Amnesty International has also had a significant\u000a      and broader influence on\u000a      their NGO activities: `Sheldon Leader is a widely acknowledged expert in\u000a      the field of business\u000a      and human rights, whose leadership has served as a catalyst for research\u000a      and advocacy\u000a      initiatives that might not otherwise have taken place' [Economic Relations\u000a      Programme Director,\u000a      Amnesty International UK].\u000a    Impact on Ugandan legislation\u000a    In 2012 Uganda's Parliament appointed a Committee on Natural Resources to\u000a      evaluate\u000a      legislation drafted to manage the country's developing oil and gas\u000a      industry. To help with the\u000a      Committee's assessment of the legislation, in January 2012 Leader\u000a      delivered a three-day\u000a      training programme in Uganda for members of the Committee. The training\u000a      programme used\u000a      Leader's research to inform them of the human rights dangers related to\u000a      the extractive industries\u000a      and to recommend legislative solutions to the problems faced in Uganda. In\u000a      the words of the\u000a      Chairperson of the Natural Resources Committee, `the training helped\u000a      improve the\u000a      understanding of members about the oil and gas sector' [source 4]. The\u000a      Committee has also\u000a      confirmed that Leader's training programme influenced changes to the draft\u000a      legislation. These\u000a      changes included the addition of new clauses to increase transparency of\u000a      the management of\u000a      the extractive industries, to ensure full state ownership of a new\u000a      National Oil Company, and to\u000a      give the Ugandan Government discretion in deciding whether to open up new\u000a      areas for\u000a      extraction licencing [source 4].\u000a    Global Witness, and Government Petroleum Contracts\u000a    Leader has collaborated with NGO Global Witness on a number of occasions\u000a      to analyse\u000a      investment contracts in Liberia and to inform Global Witness campaigns for\u000a      contractual\u000a      amendments to protect the rights of Liberian citizens. His contribution to\u000a      the work of Global\u000a      Witness in Liberia has been most prominent with regard to two major\u000a      investment contracts:\u000a    \u000a      Leader and EBHR have provided analysis of the contract between the\u000a        Government of Liberia\u000a        and Firestone Liberia Inc. The contract, first signed by the\u000a        Transitional Government and later\u000a        amended without substantial public consultation in February 2008, came\u000a        under scrutiny from\u000a        Global Witness which published a report based on his analysis in\u000a        November 2008 [source 5].\u000a      Leader and EBHR have also provided analysis of Liberia's Mineral\u000a        Development Agreement\u000a        with China Union Investment Company, signed in January 2009. His\u000a        analysis of the contract\u000a        informed a Global Witness statement on the dangers of the contract\u000a        [source 6].\u000a    \u000a    His contribution to the operation of Global Witness and the effectiveness\u000a      of their campaigns,\u000a      both in general and in the above cases, has been attested by their Team\u000a      Leader in Conflict\u000a      Resources, who writes: `I cannot overemphasise how important that work of\u000a      Prof Leader and the\u000a      other experts has been to Global Witness and in turn to Liberia. It has\u000a      enabled the Government\u000a      of Liberia to negotiate contracts that will benefit the people of Liberia'\u000a      [source 7].

His aid to the FCO's\u000a      development of the\u000a      strategy primarily took the form of his contribution of academic inputs to\u000a      four stakeholder\u000a      meetings, each held to consult a range of relevant institutions to discuss\u000a      the best way to\u000a      implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

This work has led him to develop proposals for an alternative\u000a      way to guarantee human\u000a      rights standards are adhered to while meeting the commercial interests of\u000a      investors. It is these\u000a      proposals that have most directly underpinned the impact of his research.\u000a    Leader has applied his analysis of investment negotiations to several\u000a      substantive issues,\u000a      including:\u000a    \u000a      The mutual adjustment between competing social and economic rights,\u000a        where some rights are\u000a        furthered, while others are damaged, by investment projects. Leader has\u000a        applied his\u000a        observations about directions of adjustment to criticise cases such as\u000a        that of an Exxon Mobil\u000a        pipeline in Chad and Cameroon, where a contract between the host\u000a        countries and Exxon Mobil\u000a        means that those countries would face hefty financial penalties for\u000a        prosecuting the company for\u000a        human rights violations (see 2006 and 2011).\u000a      The conflict between an investor's concern for predictable regulation\u000a        of their investment\u000a        activity, and the host state's concern for regulatory flexibility, where\u000a        the latter is often aimed at\u000a        fresh social and environmental initiatives. In these cases the concern\u000a        is that the investment\u000a        contracts preclude changes to local human rights regulation that may\u000a        occur within the lifetime of\u000a        the investment project, which could mean that these regulations lag\u000a        behind developments in\u000a        international human rights. Leader's work in this area has focussed on\u000a        the case of BP's Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan\u000a        (BTC) oil pipeline construction project in Turkey. His research on this\u000a        case\u000a        (published in a report for Amnesty International, 2003) revealed that BP\u000a        struck a deal with\u000a        Turkey whereby BP would be compensated for any changes to local\u000a        regulations adopted in\u000a        compliance with international human rights legislation. His Amnesty\u000a        report proposes that\u000a        contractual mechanisms should be introduced to ensure that the BP\u000a        investment poses minimal\u000a        risks to the human rights of local populations (see also 2006).\u000a      The tendency of some international investors to allow for damage to\u000a        occur and subsequently\u000a        pay compensation, rather than taking measures to proactively prevent\u000a        damage. Leader has\u000a        argued that if the correct direction of adjustment is adopted,\u000a        investment regulation will require\u000a        investors to take proactive measures rather than allowing for human\u000a        rights contravention (2011).\u000a    \u000a    This research on investment and human rights has been informed by\u000a      Leader's engagement in\u000a      high profile cases of negotiations between international investors and\u000a      host states. In this respect\u000a      the research and the impact of the research has had a mutually influential\u000a      relation, with his\u000a      advice in negotiations informed by his research, and further research\u000a      publications informed by\u000a      practical engagement.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43503","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"203312","Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Issues concerning reparations are of major contemporary importance.\u000a      However, there is very little clarity about how we should implement these\u000a      legal provisions. Sandoval's work has therefore filled an important gap\u000a      and had a formative influence in legal applications of the concept of\u000a      reparations.\u000a    Expert Advice for the ICC, the UN, and other Courts\u000a    In July 2005 a Vice President of the International Criminal Court invited\u000a      Sandoval to work as a visiting professional at the Court to advise her on\u000a      how to understand reparations. Sandoval's research on the Inter-American\u000a      Court was particularly valuable to her role as advisor, as at this stage\u000a      the IAC was the only court with a clearly defined treatment of\u000a      reparations. This advice to the ICC has led to the research impacting on\u000a      ICC judgements during the REF period 2008-2013. Both the ICC and the UN\u000a      have contacted Sandoval on multiple occasions since 2008 to provide them\u000a      with expert advice on reparations for gross human rights violations and\u000a      international crimes.\u000a    For example, the ICC's report on the case of the Democratic Republic of\u000a      Congo v Thomas Lubanga Dyilo includes an annex written by Sandoval\u000a      [corroborating source 1]. This annex details the understanding of\u000a      reparations in the IACHR and is based on her research in this area\u000a      (2009b). The guidance given in the ICC report makes multiple references to\u000a      practices in the IAHCR and cites both Sandoval's annex and the briefing\u000a      papers written by her students and based on her research. The ICC judged\u000a      on the Lubanga case &#8212; its first judgement on reparation &#8212; in August 2012.\u000a      The Vice President of the ICC, who was also one of Judges on the Lubanga\u000a      judgement, has personally communicated her thanks to Sandoval for bringing\u000a      the ICC's attention to relevant cases in the IAC, which guided their final\u000a      judgement:\u000a    I want to thank you for all your support over many years and the generous\u000a      contribution that you always gave me to fine tune the many ideas that\u000a      there are. You were decisive when from the beginning you made me aware of\u000a      the importance of the Inter-American Court.\u000a    Vice President of the International Criminal Court\u000a    Other examples of Court use of Sandoval's reparations work include:\u000a    \u000a      In 2009 Sandoval used her research in an amicus curiae brief on\u000a        reparations for the Inter-American Court `Cotton Field' v Mexico case.\u000a        In accordance with convention, the final judgment did not quote the\u000a        brief, but the Court did acknowledge the brief [corroborating source 3,\u000a        para 14], as the only brief dealing with reparation to be submitted to\u000a        the Court, and it is clear from the judgment that many of the views put\u000a        forward in the brief were taken on board by the Court [full analysis of\u000a        the court decision reflecting the brief is available as corroborating\u000a        source 4].\u000a      Sandoval, in collaboration with legal charity and NGO Redress (see\u000a        below), is currently using her research to litigate the case of Garcia\u000a        Lucero v Chile at the Inter-American Court. Leopoldo Garcia Lucero and\u000a        others are seeking reparations for human rights violations under\u000a        Pincohet. The case has received international media attention (see for\u000a        instance The Guardian [source 5]).\u000a    \u000a    Redress\u000a    Sandoval's research on reparations has also had significant impact on the\u000a      activities of international human rights NGO Redress, with whom Sandoval\u000a      had collaborated to produce some of the underpinning research (2009a).\u000a      Redress has used her work in a number of submissions to a range of courts\u000a      including the International Criminal Court:\u000a    \u000a      Sandoval was asked by Redress to write its January 2010 amicus curiae\u000a        brief for the case of Manuel Cruz Cavalcanti [source 6]. Here Sandoval\u000a        used her research on rehabilitation to argue that Cavalcanti was\u000a        entitled to both greater monetary compensation and other forms of\u000a        rehabilitation. In January 2011 the court awarded Cavalancti greater\u000a        monetary compensation, in accordance with Sandoval's brief [source 7].\u000a      Aside from the Redress report written by Sandoval, a second Redress\u000a        report on the concepts of reparations and victim [source 8] makes\u000a        multiple references to her publication on the concepts of injured party\u000a        and victim (2009b). This report has formed a major part of their\u000a        campaigning and was submitted to the ICC to advise on how to award\u000a        reparations.\u000a      Sandoval's report on Rehabilitation, written for Redress, has been\u000a        used by the NGO in much of their international legal campaigning. The\u000a        report was cited in Redress' discussion paper submission to the\u000a        Government of Rwanda regarding reparations for survivors of genocide\u000a        [source 9], in which Redress argue that rehabilitation `should include\u000a        medical and psychological care as well as legal and social services'\u000a        (p.6).\u000a    \u000a    Sandoval's Redress report on rehabilitation has impacted not only on the\u000a      campaigns of Redress but also on the UN Committee Against Torture (UNCAT).\u000a      Her report recommends that UNCAT write a General Comment on Article 14 of\u000a      the Convention Against Torture, which deals with reparations for torture\u000a      victims, including rehabilitation. This recommendation was a contributing\u000a      factor to UNCAT's decision to publish, in December 2012, a General Comment\u000a      on Article 14.\u000a    Sandoval was subsequently consulted and interviewed by members of the\u000a      Committee responsible for the drafting of the General Comment and her\u000a      publications were circulated to Committee members. The influence of\u000a      Sandoval's research on the General Comment is most evident in its section\u000a      concerning rehabilitation, which states that `the provision of means for\u000a      as full rehabilitation as possible...should be holistic and include\u000a      medical and psychological care as well as legal and social services'\u000a      [source 10]. The influence of Sandoval's research was attested in comments\u000a      made by a member of UNCAT, Nora Sveaass. In a paper given by Dr Sveaass to\u000a      the Washington College of Law Sveaass said that Sandoval's Redress report\u000a      `gives a very good and comprehensive review on the history of\u000a      rehabilitation in treaties, declarations, and conventions on human rights,\u000a      and in particular reparation' [source 11].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Clara Sandoval's research has helped to clarify the scope of the\u000a      obligation to provide reparations under international law.

Sandoval's publications on the legal\u000a      principle of reparations deal with two questions: who can claim to be a\u000a      victim for the purposes of reparation? and what is the scope of particular\u000a      forms of reparations, such as rehabilitation, under international law?\u000a    In answer to the first question Sandoval (Lecturer in Law from 2003,\u000a      Senior Lecturer from 2009) has argued that the legal definition of\u000a      `victim' ought to be flexible, culturally sensitive, and broad, on the\u000a      grounds that applying the concept in this way will ensure we deal\u000a      adequately with all those who suffered serious human rights violations.\u000a      This research includes Sandoval's work on the use of the concepts of\u000a      victim and injured party in the Inter-American Court of Human Rights\u000a      (2009b), the details of which supported her contention that courts should\u000a      apply both concepts when awarding reparations for human rights violations.\u000a    Sandoval has also argued that reparations should extend to the family\u000a      members of direct victims of human rights violations, as those family\u000a      members are often also harmed by, for instance, the loss of the family\u000a      breadwinner, and suffer mental and emotional harm as the result of the\u000a      loss of a loved one (Sandoval et al. 2009). The research on the concept of\u000a      victim and family members has been used in debates at the International\u000a      Criminal Court, the Extraordinary Chambers of the Courts of Cambodia, and\u000a      in litigation (see section 4).\u000a    To answer the second question, Sandoval has worked with human rights NGO\u000a      Redress on research into the legal definition of rehabilitation, a\u000a      particular form of reparations. Before Sandoval's research on the issue,\u000a      nothing in academic research had been written on the legal concept of\u000a      rehabilitation and the concept was considered to be limited to physical\u000a      and mental health. Sandoval has argued that the concept of rehabilitation\u000a      should be considered to be more holistic: rehabilitation ought to include\u000a      the provision of assistance on social services, legal services, and\u000a      financial services to victims of human rights violations. Sandoval's\u000a      report for Redress (2009a) also recommended that the UN Committee Against\u000a      Torture publish clarification of the definition of rehabilitation.\u000a    Sandoval has also researched the gendered dimensions of reparations. Her\u000a      article on the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) `Cotton Field'\u000a      judgement (2011) is the culmination of her research into how judges should\u000a      approach claims from women who have been victims of discrimination, abuse,\u000a      and sexual violence. The paper proposes elements of a holistic gender\u000a      approach to reparations to be followed by international tribunals in cases\u000a      of violence and discrimination against women. These proposals are based on\u000a      research that Sandoval undertook before the Cotton Field\u000a      judgement, research which resulted both in this academic publication and\u000a      her amicus curiae submitted to the IACHR for the Cotton Field case\u000a      (see section 4).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43545","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    a) The first piece of research concerned the retention of Police National\u000a      Computer records for those found guilty as teenagers but with a subsequent\u000a      long conviction-free period, and was carried out in the early part of\u000a      2008, Our team members were called as expert witnesses in a Information\u000a      Tribunal case held in April 2008 between the Information Commissioners\u000a      (IC) and five police authorities, following a police appeal against an\u000a      earlier judgement by the IC that the police authorities should delete\u000a      early convictions from the Police National Computer. Our research on the\u000a      comparison of the risk of reconviction for those with an early conviction\u000a      before the age of 21 compared to the risk of a first conviction for those\u000a      conviction free before the age of 21 was developed under an ESRC research\u000a      methods grant, and relates to the concept of hazard rate convergence. The\u000a      research was used to form a report to the court. The report was quoted\u000a      extensively by the tribunal chair. For example, page 30 of the judgment\u000a      states that:\u000a    \"we did find the expert evidence helpful in making our own judgment\u000a        about the practical significance of the conviction information that is\u000a        at issue in this case and that it could be informed by the statistical\u000a        work in the Francis\/Soothill report...\"\u000a    The appeal case led to a Government review of the retention of police\u000a      records and to the appointment of a new post of Independent Advisor on\u000a      Criminality Information Management.\u000a    b) The second part of the research concerned the retention of DNA\u000a      profiles for those arrested but not found guilty and was carried out in\u000a      2009 and 2010. A Home Office consultation on DNA profile retention was\u000a      released in April 2009 which proposed controversial measures to the\u000a      retention of DNA sample profiles for those arrested but not found guilty\u000a      (these were six years for adult arrestees, with twelve years for adults\u000a      arrested for violent and sexual crimes). We made a submission to the Home\u000a      Office consultation document which criticised the methodology of the\u000a      research carried out by the Jill Dando institute, and suggested that a\u000a      differential retention period for those arrested for serious offences\u000a      lacked evidence.\u000a    Following subsequent press coverage of this issue in The Guardian\u000a      and online blogs, we were contacted by the Chief Economic Advisor to the\u000a      Home Office, John Elliott, to provide advice to improve their research,\u000a      and subsequently to critique their new research supporting the revised\u000a      policy. Our recommendation that there be no distinction between retention\u000a      periods for arrests for serious offences and arrests for less serious\u000a      offences was accepted, as was an improved methodology. This has now led to\u000a      a revised policy which has been implemented in a new Act &#8212; the Protection\u000a      of Freedoms Act 2010-12, which now contains a reduced five year retention\u000a      period for DNA profiles for those arrested but not found guilty.\u000a      This impact was chosen to be an ESRC\u000a        Impact case study.\u000a    c) The third part of the research has resulted in the OGRS3 tool that has\u000a      been adopted by the National Probation Agency for the assessment of\u000a      recidivism risk in pre-sentence reports presented to the courts, and is\u000a      thus being used to assess and prioritise offenders. For example, the\u000a      Ministry of Justice's 2011 National Offender Management Service guidance\u000a      \"Determining pre sentence reports\" states that \"A RoSH screening and\u000a        OGRS calculation must be completed for all report formats\" It is\u000a      also used in the Prison Service as a way of determining enrolment of\u000a      offenders into the Enhanced Thinking Skills (ETS) programme.\u000a    The OGRS3 tool is additionally increasingly being used as a measure for\u000a      \"payment by results\" contracts for reducing reoffending. Contractors are\u000a      assessed against the expected level of reoffending produced from OGRS from\u000a      an available prison sample, and their chosen intervention is expected to\u000a      reduce offending below that level, otherwise a reduced payment is made.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Policy on offender management has been changed in several areas through\u000a      statistical research on criminal careers.

Brian Francis (Senior Lecturer, then Professor of Social\u000a      Statistics) and Keith Soothill (Professor of Social Research) were the key\u000a      researchers in this work.\u000a    a) Data from the Home Office's Offenders Index was analysed, which\u000a      contains a one in thirteen sample of all convictions in England and Wales\u000a      organised by offender. The yearly risk of reconviction after age 21 given\u000a      a single non-violent conviction before age 21 was examined. Two birth\u000a      cohorts of offenders were used &#8212; 1953 and 1958. This risk of a\u000a      reconviction in the offending groups was compared with the risk of first\u000a      conviction for a non-offending group from the same birth cohort, obtained\u000a      by combining the non-offenders from the Offenders Index data augmented\u000a      with population data and using a discrete time hazard rate analysis. We\u000a      found that the risk of reconviction for the offending group declined\u000a      rapidly and had nearly converged to the risk of a first conviction for the\u000a      non-offending group by age 35 in both cohorts. This provided evidence that\u000a      the retention of criminal convictions long in the past was of no\u000a      operational value for future offending. [1]\u000a    b) The research described in a) was extended to deal with the topic of\u000a      the retention of DNA profiles for arrestees rather than the retention of\u000a      criminal records. This additional research was motivated by the\u000a      publication of a consultation document by the Home Office on DNA retention\u000a      methodology which contained a flawed methodology. [2] [3]\u000a    c) Ordinal split-sample regression models were investigated under\u000a      research funded by the Home Office for a new reconviction assessment tool\u000a      which can be used to estimate both one-year and two year reconviction\u000a      probabilities. The model can be used reliably on Police National Computer\u000a      conviction records. A new non-linear offending rate variable was developed\u000a      as part of the model which offers substantial improvement in predictive\u000a      ability over the old methodology.

Commenting on this controversial decision, one\u000a      firm of legal\u000a      practitioners (Paris Smith LLP) said in its legal blog of November 21st\u000a      2011 that it is no longer\u000a      good enough to say that \"we\u000a        did what Sealy and Milman told us to do\".

The hallmark of his scholarship is the bridge-building\u000a      between the academic and\u000a      practitioner communities in the exchange of insights. The focus in this\u000a      study is on Milman's\u000a      research since joining Lancaster in 2005, though continuity with earlier\u000a      research is apparent. The\u000a      impact covers the current REF period. The study covers that body of law\u000a      (primarily based on\u000a      legislation) that regulates the relationship between debtors and creditors\u000a      in the event of financial\u000a      default. An effective system of insolvency law is essential to any economy\u000a      where credit provides\u000a      the lifeblood for interactions. The research is doctrinal and enriched by\u000a      Milman's empirical studies\u000a      in the 1990s (e.g. on CVAs and transactional avoidance). Comparative\u000a      analysis is undertaken to\u000a      offer a range of diverse insights. Milman's research outputs take the form\u000a      of leading texts,\u000a      scholarly monographs, journal papers and essays included by invitation in\u000a      collected works.\u000a    In the Annotated Guide, the central research effort\u000a      involves an analysis of the interaction between\u000a      the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Insolvency Rules 1986. Both the Act and\u000a      the Rules are\u000a      continually being amended (and reinterpreted by the courts), so the\u000a      relationship between these\u000a      regimes is in a constant state of flux. This requires re-evaluation by\u000a      researchers. Add to this\u000a      additional secondary legislation and the unpredictability of judicial\u000a      decision-making and then one\u000a      can appreciate the difficulty of keeping on top of the research subject.\u000a      It is this ability to present an\u000a      expert real-time understanding of the law as it stands today\u000a      (aided by the annual publication and\u000a      the frequent Westlaw updates) that provides the real value of the Annotated\u000a          Guide to all users. The\u000a      publication went into ebook format in 2012 using Thomson Reuters ProView\u000a      technology.\u000a    Assessing 7 years of development (particularly when set against the\u000a      context of the pressures\u000a      exerted by the global economic crisis) in insolvency law represents a\u000a      considerable research\u000a      challenge. The Annotated Guide has to cope constantly with\u000a      new legislation and the implications\u000a      of fresh judicial rulings, some of which are contradictory. So, the Annotated\u000a          Guide offered first\u000a      detailed analysis of the new debt relief order regime in 2009 (a procedure\u000a      designed to provide\u000a      relief for debtors with no income and no assets), and the major changes to\u000a      core secondary\u000a      legislation in 2010 . Other significant legislative developments since\u000a      2005 analysed in the\u000a      Annotated Guide include the Cross Border Insolvency\u000a      Regulations 2006. The 16th edition begins\u000a      to address major upcoming changes to bankruptcy initiation procedure.\u000a      There are some 100 new\u000a      cases across the spectrum that have to be researched\/evaluated annually.\u000a      Having built up a vast\u000a      store of foundational knowledge in the field, Milman is in an ideal\u000a      position to contextualise any such\u000a      new developments by drawing upon his historical perspective.\u000a    The underpinning research predates 1993 and continues post 2005. The\u000a      volatile nature of the\u000a      research enterprise is reflected by the number of editions of the Annotated\u000a          Guide published since\u000a      2005, which constitute a link between the underpinning research carried\u000a      out at Lancaster and the\u000a      impact. Milman is a 50% contributor with the co-author Sealy, an Emeritus\u000a      Professor of Corporate\u000a      Law at the University of Cambridge.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43547","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the research reaches to international levels and national\u000a      and local levels in the UK, and has significance for the allocation of\u000a      funding for NGOs in Western Europe, national-level policy priorities in\u000a      the UK, and service delivery at regional-level in the UK.

The impacts of\u000a      the research on the allocation of funding and support for victims at\u000a      international-level is described by testimony provided for this case study\u000a      by the Director of the European Network Against Racism (ENAR):\u000a    \"ENAR...the largest European advocacy network on racial equality &#8212; has\u000a      been collaborating with Dr Iganski since 2009, when ENAR decided to become\u000a      more active in advocacy in the field of racially motivated hate crimes and\u000a      enlisted his expertise. ENAR had been impressed at the time by Dr\u000a      Iganski's book Hate Crime and the City and his sensitive approach\u000a      to victims, which takes into account the reality of the perpetrators as\u000a      well. First, we invited Dr Iganski to speak at an ENAR seminar on\u000a      supporting victims of racially motivated hate crimes. ENAR members\u000a      provided extremely positive feedback to his presentation and work. As a\u000a      consequence, ENAR decided to cooperate with him further. In 2010, the Open\u000a      Society Foundations commissioned ENAR to compile a trend mapping report on\u000a      racist violence and crimes in Europe. Dr Iganski was offered the\u000a      coordination role of the research, guiding and overseeing the national\u000a      authors, and drafting the final European report (Iganski 2011 Racist\u000a        Violence in Europe, Brussels: ENAR, launched at a meeting\u000a      held by the European Parliament's Anti-Racism and Diversity Intergroup in\u000a      March 2011. This report had a tremendous impact both for ENAR's future\u000a      funding as well as on the funding policies of the Open Society\u000a        Foundations. It confirmed that anti-racist activities and\u000a      organisations in Western Europe need to be supported to compensate for the\u000a      sharp decrease in public funding, on the one hand, and the dramatic surge\u000a      of anti-democratic political parties and movements, which had an impact on\u000a      victims of racist violence, on the other hand. As a consequence, the Open\u000a      Society Foundations commissioned further studies that led to the\u000a      establishment of the Xen Fund for anti-racist organisations working in\u000a      Western Europe in late 2011.\"\u000a    Impact on national-level policy for tackling hate crime in the UK\u000a    Iganski's research illuminating the psychological and emotional impacts\u000a      of `hate crime' upon victims has informed national-level policy in the UK\u000a      as testified by the Hate Crime Programme Manager at the Ministry of\u000a        Justice, UK, who has written that:\u000a    \"My personal view is that hate crime tends to cause more harm than\u000a      comparable `random' crimes, that they have a broader effect on communities\u000a      and create an enhanced fear of crime. Whilst these views were commonly\u000a      accepted, it was important that they could be substantiated and for that\u000a      we relied on the research of key academics. Amongst the most valuable was\u000a      the research of Dr Paul Iganski from Lancaster University. His work to\u000a      understand the findings of the British Crime Survey was invaluable to us\u000a      because it was the most definitive evidence that hate crime did have a\u000a      greater psychological impact on the victims.\" (Giannasi, P. [2014]\u000a      `Academia from a Practitioner's Perspective: A Reflection on the Changes\u000a      in the Relationship between Academia, Policing and Government in a Hate\u000a      Crime Context' in Neil Chakraborti and Jon Garland (eds.)

Most notably, though, his analysis of the British Crime\u000a      Survey has underpinned policy. It provided us with conclusive proof that\u000a      hate crime 'hurts more' than similar non-targeted crime, a principle that\u000a      has motivated government and CJS agencies and was cited in Government\u000a      Action Plans.\"\u000a    Impact on service delivery at regional level in the UK\u000a    Following a commissioned evaluation of their Race Hate Awareness\u000a        &amp; Prevention service, Iganski joined with the Preston &amp;\u000a        Western Lancashire Racial Equality Council and Lancashire Constabulary\u000a      to apply his research findings on the impacts and consequences of hate\u000a      crime to developing the design and delivery of their `Effective\u000a      Interventions in Addressing Hate' training in 2012\/13, for staff and\u000a      patients at Lancashire Care NHS Trust's medium secure forensic psychiatric\u000a      hospital, Guild Lodge. In the sessions Iganski presented his key research\u000a      findings on the harms of hate crime and also understandings of how\u000a      perceived hurts can provide the contexts for offenders' actions. Informed\u000a      by these understandings, in group work exercises and discussions involving\u000a      case studies of incidents that have occurred in the hospital, participants\u000a      discussed how they might support staff and patients who are victimised in\u000a      hate incidents. Evaluation comments provided by participants demonstrated\u000a      the impacts of the understandings shared, and changes in thinking among\u000a      participants, about the harms of hate crime:\u000a    \u000a      `Affects the person internally as it is about their personality &#8212;\u000a        something they can't change'.\u000a      `Understand definitions and psychological impact more'.\u000a      `Helpful to understand legal and psychological aspects of hate crime &#8212;\u000a        a learning curve for me'\u000a      `More empowered how to intervene if patients are abusive'\u000a    \u000a    In testimony provided for this case study, the manager of the Race\u000a        Hate Awareness &amp; Prevention service has noted that \"Dr Paul\u000a      Iganski's evaluation of our project has been invaluable in further\u000a      highlighting the harms caused by hate and the vital role NGOs play in\u000a      supporting victims of hate crimes.

While most victims of crime suffer some psychological and\u000a      emotional trauma, research evidence now clearly indicates that victims of\u000a      'hate crime' are more likely than other victims to report such effects.\u000a      This research has made a substantial contribution to the evidence. The\u000a      understanding developed has important implications for supporting victims\u000a      and for preventing offending, implications which have been followed\u000a      through in policy and practice informed by the research.\u000a    A significant step forward in the evidence was taken by Iganski's\u000a      research on the greater reported impact of racist crimes, published in the\u000a      monograph Hate Crime and the City in 2008. While early research in\u000a      the 1990s conducted mainly in the United States began to illuminate the\u000a      particular psychological and emotional impacts of 'hate crimes', the\u000a      research at Lancaster University overcame methodological limitations of\u000a      earlier studies by using large random samples of victims, multivariate\u000a      analyses, and multiple controls, with British Crime Survey (BCS) data. The\u000a      research led the field in its innovation. Extensions of the analysis since\u000a      then by Iganski and colleagues initiated and commissioned by the Equality\u000a      and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) using more recent sweeps of the BCS,\u000a      continues to lead the field into even further understanding of the impacts\u000a      and consequences of hate crime beyond racist crimes to other types of\u000a      identity crime in which victims are targeted because of their religion,\u000a      sexual orientation, disability, or age. The research is without precedent\u000a      and match internationally. It is cited internationally, and has resulted\u000a      in a range of impacts described in this case study. Some involve direct\u000a      impacts on service delivery for victims and offenders.\u000a    The hurts involved in `hate crime' also pertain to the perpetrators.\u000a      While understanding about the motivating impulses of hate crime offenders\u000a      has been increasingly drawn out by research across a number of countries,\u000a      research carried out at Lancaster University has made a unique\u000a      contribution by illuminating and sharing practitioner experience in\u000a      working with hate crime offenders in general and in intervening with the\u000a      offenders' felt hurts in particular. Informed by his earlier research on\u000a      the perpetrators of racist violence funded by the ESRC's Research Violence\u000a      Programme David Smith (Lancaster, Sociology) began to develop ideas on\u000a      what would constitute a helpful and effective approach to intervention\u000a      with such offenders in the community. On the strength of this published\u000a      work Smith was commissioned to evaluate one of only two specialist\u000a      probation programmes in the UK for racist offenders at the time (Palmer\u000a      and Smith 2010). Smith subsequently collaborated with Iganski on an\u000a      international survey of rehabilitation programmes for hate crime\u000a      offenders, commissioned and funded by the EHRC (Scotland) (2011), which\u000a      brought together an international research team of leading `hate crime'\u000a      scholars and practitioners. The research report, Rehabilitation of\u000a        Hate Crime Offenders, was launched at an engagement event organised\u000a      by the EHRC in Edinburgh in March 2011 attended by Scottish Government\u000a      officials, senior representatives from criminal justice agencies and NGOs\u000a      in Scotland. The event was reported on the STV\u000a        six o'clock news, in national Scottish newspapers, and in over\u000a      thirty local newspapers in Scotland. More recently, Iganski has continued\u000a      the work by updating this project's findings with evidence gathered by the\u000a      Northern Ireland Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders\u000a      (NIACRO) (2012) in a project commissioned by NIACRO for their Challenge\u000a      Hate Crime Programme.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43548","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research carried out by Skogly has resulted in a heightened attention\u000d\u000a      to the legal foundations for extraterritorial human rights obligations\u000d\u000a      amongst NGOs, the UN's human rights bodies and human rights practitioners\u000d\u000a      more generally.

The Principles were adopted in the\u000d\u000a      tradition of the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the\u000d\u000a        International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\u000d\u000a      (1986) and the Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social\u000d\u000a        and Cultural Rights (1998), both of which have had significant\u000d\u000a      impact upon the understanding of current international human rights law.\u000d\u000a      The Consortium actively disseminates the 2011 Principles and, after two\u000d\u000a      years, it is clear that the Principles are actively used by UN human\u000d\u000a      rights bodies and NGOs.\u000d\u000a    Following the adoption of the Principles, the UN Special Rapporteur on\u000d\u000a      the Right to Food, Olivier de Schutter, sent the following unsolicited\u000d\u000a      email to Skogly:\u000d\u000a      \"I think everyone will agree with me that these principles would never\u000d\u000a      have emerged without your own cutting edge work on this issue: you were\u000d\u000a      the first, [...], to put an explicit emphasis on this emerging dimension\u000d\u000a      of international human rights law\".\u000d\u000a    Likewise, the Human Rights Director of FIAN International stated that\u000d\u000a      \"Skogly's various research articles contributed to the discussion within\u000d\u000a      the Consortium.

The research is situated in the\u000d\u000a      debate amongst international human rights lawyers about the reach of human\u000d\u000a      rights obligations generally. The traditional view has been that states\u000d\u000a      have human rights obligations only towards their own citizens\/residents,\u000d\u000a      and that only states have such human rights obligations. The debate\u000d\u000a      questioning this traditional view amongst academics and practitioners\u000d\u000a      started in the late 1980s and addressed, inter alia, whether this\u000d\u000a      narrow view of obligation-subjects represented a true picture of how human\u000d\u000a      rights are violated and by whom. This led to significant discussion on\u000d\u000a      human rights obligations of non-state actors, such as international\u000d\u000a      organisations and multinational corporations, amongst others.\u000d\u000a    After significant contribution to the debate described above through her\u000d\u000a      work on the human rights obligations of international financial\u000d\u000a      institutions, Skogly's research took a different path, and addressed\u000d\u000a      whether states as the primary obligation subjects only have human rights\u000d\u000a      obligations towards their own citizens\/residence, or whether and if so how\u000d\u000a      international human rights law provides for obligations for states outside\u000d\u000a      their own borders. In other words, does a state have responsibility for\u000d\u000a      the human rights effects of its international cooperation or foreign\u000d\u000a      policy on individuals in foreign states? Part of the research was carried\u000d\u000a      out through archival work in the United Nations in Geneva where the\u000d\u000a      preparatory works for the two International Covenants on Human Rights was\u000d\u000a      analysed in depth. Furthermore, other sources of international human\u000d\u000a      rights law (including treaties, customary law) and case-law were studied,\u000d\u000a      and Skogly systematically detailed the foundations for and scope of\u000d\u000a      extraterritorial human rights obligations, particularly in the field of\u000d\u000a      economic, social and cultural rights.\u000d\u000a    The main findings of the research are threefold:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The drafters of the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\u000d\u000a        considered that States' human rights obligations go beyond national\u000d\u000a        borders, and that states should not be able to commit actions (or\u000d\u000a        refrain from necessary actions to protect human rights) abroad that they\u000d\u000a        could not carry out at home.\u000d\u000a      While this was clear for economic and social rights through an\u000d\u000a        analysis of the drafting history of the relevant covenant, the\u000d\u000a        extraterritorial reach of obligations for civil and political rights has\u000d\u000a        been confirmed by international judicial bodies such as the European\u000d\u000a        Court of Human Rights and the UN Committee on Human Rights.\u000d\u000a      Very little attention has been given to these aspects of human rights\u000d\u000a        obligations, by NGOs, the United Nations and national governments.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Through the publication of journal articles and a monograph in 2006 (Beyond\u000a        National Borders: States' Human Rights Obligations in International\u000d\u000a        Cooperation), Skogly's work became known in non-academic circles,\u000d\u000a      and in particular in non-governmental human rights organisations.

Beyani 2000a\u000a      underpins the formulation of the African Union (Kampala) Convention for\u000a      the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons (2009). In\u000a      that study (2000a: 146-7) and in a follow-up essay (2013a: 25-34), Dr\u000a      Beyani sets out criteria for determining the rights of internally\u000a      displaced Africans to bring actions against their states of origin. Those\u000a      criteria are partly replicated in Article 4 of the Kampala Convention. On\u000a      the basis of his scholarship, Dr Beyani was from 2004 to 2009 accorded a\u000a      lead role in the treaty making process of the African Union: this resulted\u000a      in the adoption of the Kampala Convention in 2009 (details on Dr Beyani's\u000a      role can be found in the Brookings Institution's documentary on his work -\u000a      section 5, source 5 &#8212; and in Beyani 2008: 197). This Convention is the\u000a      first to create binding obligations on how to protect and provide\u000a      assistance to persons displaced within states by causes such as violations\u000a      of human rights, generalized violence, armed conflict, and natural or\u000a      human made disasters.\u000a    From 2004 to 2006, Dr Beyani led the treaty making process of the\u000a      International Conference of the Great Lakes Region, resulting in the\u000a      adoption of the Great Lakes Region of the Pact on Security, Stability and\u000a      Development (section 5, sources 1, 2 and 3). This Pact was devised as a\u000a      means to end conflict in the Great Lakes Region where five States had\u000a      recently gone to war. Since it was agreed in 2006, the Pact has been used\u000a      by the Foreign Ministers of the Great Lakes Region as the basis for their\u000a      twice-yearly meetings to examine issues relating to peace, security, and\u000a      development, and make recommendations to the Heads of State of the Summit:\u000a      in August 2012, for example, the Pact formed the framework of the Great\u000a      Lakes foreign affairs ministers' efforts to find a solution to the\u000a      conflict in the eastern District Republic of Congo (\"Great Lakes Ministers\u000a      for Neutral Force in DRC\", Observer 7 August 2012). Portions of\u000a      Beyani 2000a inform his contribution to the drafting of the Great Lakes\u000a      Protocols. For example, the wording of Article 4(g) of the Protocol on the\u000a      Protection and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons -\u000a    \"Member States undertake to ... [e]nsure freedom of movement and choice\u000a      of residence within designated areas of location, except when restrictions\u000a      on such movement and residence are necessary, justified, and\u000a      proportionate\"\u000a    - finds its early form in Beyani 2000a: 60:\u000a    \"Standards pertaining to the movement and residence of persons in\u000a      regional entities ... [to be] determined on an objective basis by\u000a      reference to the justification, the reasonableness, and the proportion of\u000a      the act complained of\".\u000a    Beyani was among the team of experts appointed by the International\u000a      Commission on State Intervention and Sovereignty to formulate the\u000a      responsibility to protect. He was assigned the task of examining `state\u000a      sovereignty' and `intervention' in international law. His findings were\u000a      reflected in the formulation of the Responsibility to Protect as endorsed\u000a      by the World Summit Outcome in 2005 in General Assembly Resolution\u000a      A\/RES\/60\/1. 2005, para 138:\u000a    \"Each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations\u000a      from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\u000a      This responsibility entails the prevention of such crimes, including their\u000a      incitement, through appropriate and necessary means\".\u000a    In developing this formulation, Beyani relied on research undertaken and\u000a      published in chapter 1 of 2013a, where an early attempt at the formulation\u000a      can be found at pp.4-5:\u000a    \"Th[e] concept [of state sovereignty] cannot be examined in isolation of\u000a      its function in the system of international order ... [but rather must be]\u000a      be based on the idea of sovereignty as underlying a primary responsibility\u000a      for states to protect the safety, lives, welfare, and well-being of\u000a      persons, and to discharge the functions of government adequately\".\u000a    The Responsibility to Protect was invoked by the UN Security Council in\u000a      its resolution S\/RES\/1973 (2011) in relation to Libya (authorizing \"all\u000a      necessary measures\" to protect civilians) and in its resolution S\/RES\/1975\u000a      (2011) in relation to Ivory Coast (\"Reaffirming [the Council's] strong\u000a      commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and\u000a      unity of C&#244;te d'Ivoire ...\").\u000a    Why the impact matters. There are two important consequences which\u000a      derive from Beyani's research having had the impact demonstrated in this\u000a      study: a) the rights of refugees (and, especially, internally displaced\u000a      persons) are better protected than had been the case before Beyani was\u000a      given the opportunity to put his research to practical effect; and b) the\u000a      African constitution- and treatise-building initiatives detailed in this\u000a      study would, but for Beyani's interventions based on his underpinning\u000a      research, be at a significantly less advanced stage.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Beyani's research on the protection of refugees' human rights\u000a      demonstrably underpins his work as a drafter of the Kenyan Constitution,\u000a      as a United Nations Special Rapporteur, and as an expert advisor on the\u000a      content of international treaties concerning protections to be accorded to\u000a      internally displaced persons.

The core proposition of his\u000a      2000a and subsequent research outputs is that arrangements for refugee\u000a      protection invariably impose a false dichotomy between refugee-specific\u000a      standards and human rights standards. Although freedom of movement is a\u000a      fundamental liberty, international and domestic legal interpretations of\u000a      the concept are often premised, if only implicitly, on a model of\u000a      protection which does not recognize refugees as bearers of the full\u000a      panoply of human rights and freedoms. According to Beyani, the fundamental\u000a      challenge for those endeavouring to develop and advance national and\u000a      international norms regarding refugee protection is that of satisfactorily\u000a      addressing this core proposition.\u000a    Principally on the basis of 2000a, Beyani has become, over the past\u000a      decade, an international expert on freedom of movement and, in particular,\u000a      on internal displacement. In 1999-2000 &#8212; prompted by the fact that many\u000a      involved in the Rwandan genocide had infiltrated refugee camps in Tanzania\u000a      and the Democratic Republic of the Congo &#8212; Beyani agreed to chair a\u000a      research project examining the content and application of the 1951 United\u000a      Nations Refugee Convention. The resulting output (2000b) &#8212; making the\u000a      case, in accordance with Article 1(F)(a) of the Refugee Convention, for\u000a      excluding from refugee protection those who have committed international\u000a      crimes &#8212; was presented to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda\u000a      and led, in 2003, to the redrafting of the United Nations' High\u000a      Commissioner for Refugees' guidelines on the exclusion from refugee\u000a      protection (section 5, source 6).\u000a    Beyani 2013a is composed of essays written between 2000 and 2008;\u000a      research for chapter 3 of the collection (2013a: 36-63) was supported by a\u000a      &#163;70,000 grant from the Open Society Foundation. Beyani also received\u000a      funding from the Ford Foundation in 2003 (through the Pilkington Trust) to\u000a      produce a guide on the use of the African Human Rights System to protect\u000a      the rights of refugees; the guide was eventually published as Beyani\u000a      2013b. The importance of his research on displaced persons has been\u000a      recognized in his appointment as United Nations Special Rapporteur on the\u000a      Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons (section 5, source 4). As\u000a      Special Rapporteur, he undertakes field research and produces official\u000a      reports which are presented to the UN Human Rights Council and the General\u000a      Assembly each year.\u000a    Although this case study is confined to instances where Beyani's impact\u000a      during the REF period can be clearly connected to his research, it is\u000a      worth noting that his broader impact on international human rights law is\u000a      immense. For example, in December 2008 &#8212; following the violence after the\u000a      presidential elections in 2007 failed to produce a clear winner &#8212; he was\u000a      invited by the African Union Panel of African Eminent Personalities, led\u000a      by Kofi Annan, to participate in drafting the new Constitution of Kenya.\u000a      His nomination was ratified in February 2009 and he served in Kenya while\u000a      on sabbatical until October 2010. The new Constitution has been the engine\u000a      of wider reforms in Kenya, inspiring a rebirth of the country, renewed\u000a      peace, as well as democracy, good governance, and human rights protection.\u000a      Beyani played a key role in the making of this constitution, including his\u000a      carrying out civic education in all parts of Kenya during its preparation.\u000a      He is now performing a similar role in both Zambia and South Sudan.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43761","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impacts described in this case study were the result of much work by\u000d\u000a      many people (relatives,\u000d\u000a      survivors, campaigners, elected members, journalists and others) over a\u000d\u000a      long period. Scraton's\u000d\u000a      work at Edge Hill between 1990 and 2003 made a key contribution.\u000d\u000a    The research by Scraton and colleagues at Edge Hill University indicated\u000d\u000a      that police\u000d\u000a      records\/statements relating to the disaster had been altered and that this\u000d\u000a      had been part of a co-ordinated\u000d\u000a      strategy. Following the publication of No Last Rights (Scraton et\u000d\u000a      al., 1995) the then\u000d\u000a      Labour Government announced a judicial scrutiny under Lord Justice\u000d\u000a      Stuart-Smith (published\u000d\u000a      1998) to consider questions of suppressed evidence and the altering of\u000d\u000a      police documentation.\u000d\u000a      Scraton gave evidence. Stuart-Smith's findings were that `it would have\u000d\u000a      been better' had there\u000d\u000a      been no alterations and that it may have revealed an `error of judgement',\u000d\u000a      but stopped short of\u000d\u000a      stating that it amounted to unprofessional conduct.\u000d\u000a    The Judicial Scrutiny did not end the questioning of the official\u000d\u000a      construction and reconstruction of\u000d\u000a      the `truth' about Hillsborough. The Hillsborough Family Support Group with\u000d\u000a      support from Scraton,\u000d\u000a      the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, and Merseyside MPs (notably Maria Eagle\u000d\u000a      who contacted\u000d\u000a      Scraton with regard to getting key South Yorkshire Police records released\u000d\u000a      and sent to House of\u000d\u000a      Commons library) continued to campaign for a disclosure of official\u000d\u000a      documentation on the disaster.\u000d\u000a      Scraton's book Hillsborough: The Truth was published in 1999.\u000d\u000a    In 2009, at the 20th anniversary of the disaster, Andy Burnham, Secretary\u000d\u000a      of State for Culture,\u000d\u000a      Media and Sport, announced the Government's intention to waive the 30-year\u000d\u000a      rule withholding\u000d\u000a      public records to enable disclosure of all documents relating to the\u000d\u000a      disaster.\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/hillsborough.independent.gov.uk\/report\/Section-1\/summary\/).\u000d\u000a    The former Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport sums up the\u000d\u000a      impact of the research\u000d\u000a      thus:\u000d\u000a    It is impossible to overstate the importance of the work Professor\u000d\u000a      Scraton did in the 1990-2003\u000d\u000a      period.\u000d\u000a    Quite simply, the full horror and injustice of Hillsborough would never\u000d\u000a      have been revealed\u000d\u000a      were it not for his thoroughness and determination.\u000d\u000a    Phil Scraton turned over stones that others walked past.\u000d\u000a    His book \"Hillsborough &#8212; The Truth\" prompted me to call for full\u000d\u000a      disclosure on the 20th\u000d\u000a      Anniversary of the disaster.\u000d\u000a    The full implications of Professor Scraton's work will reverberate for\u000d\u000a      many years to come.\u000d\u000a    (Factual statement 1)\u000d\u000a    In the aftermath of the 20th Anniversary of the disaster, in\u000d\u000a      January 2010 the Home Secretary\u000d\u000a      announced the formation of the Hillsborough Independent Panel. Scraton\u000d\u000a      (now at QUB) was\u000d\u000a      appointed as one of the members. The Panel had the task of managing\u000d\u000a      disclosure, examining\u000d\u000a      documents and reporting on how they added to the public's understanding of\u000d\u000a      the disaster. The\u000d\u000a      publication of the Panel's report in September 2012 (Other Source 1)\u000d\u000a      represented the culmination\u000d\u000a      of attempts by bereaved and survivor groups to view this material. This is\u000d\u000a      of importance not only\u000d\u000a      because of the issues of `truth management' that have characterised the\u000d\u000a      aftermath of the disaster\u000d\u000a      but also because such limited evidence that has been belatedly released\u000d\u000a      has been `littered with\u000d\u000a      factual inaccuracies, contradictory statements, contestable assumptions\u000d\u000a      and ambiguous\u000d\u000a      identifications' (Scraton's (2007) Power, Conflict and Criminalisation,\u000d\u000a      Routledge). The Panel\u000d\u000a      Report drew upon, and confirmed, Scraton's earlier findings in the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research of this\u000d\u000a      case study and reported in Hillsborough: The Truth.\u000d\u000a    In addition to the disclosure of documents and the formation of the\u000d\u000a      Panel, there are a number of\u000d\u000a      impacts (arising before end July 2013) that stem from the work of the\u000d\u000a      Panel and that have direct\u000d\u000a      lineage to the underpinning Hillsborough Project conducted at Edge Hill\u000d\u000a      University which revealed\u000d\u000a      serious issues of `truth management' in the aftermath of the disaster:\u000d\u000a    Political impact: the Panel Report fully endorsed the findings of\u000d\u000a      Scraton's research regarding the\u000d\u000a      truth about Hillsborough, confirming his findings that police\u000d\u000a      records\/statements had been altered,\u000d\u000a      that this was part of a co-ordinated strategy and that other documents had\u000d\u000a      been altered or\u000d\u000a      suppressed, leading to a Prime Ministerial apology (Other Source 2). The\u000d\u000a      apology addressed in\u000d\u000a      particular the issue of safety at the ground, the long fight of the\u000d\u000a      families and acknowledged that `It\u000d\u000a      was wrong&#8212;quite profoundly wrong&#8212;that the police changed the records of\u000d\u000a      what happened and\u000d\u000a      tried to blame the fans. [...] Indeed, the new evidence with which we are\u000d\u000a      presented today makes\u000d\u000a      it clear, in my view, that these families have suffered a double\u000d\u000a      injustice: the injustice of the\u000d\u000a      appalling events&#8212;the failure of the state to protect their loved ones and\u000d\u000a      the indefensible wait to\u000d\u000a      get to the truth; and then the injustice of the denigration of the\u000d\u000a      deceased &#8212; that they were somehow\u000d\u000a      at fault for their own deaths.' The underpinning research by Scraton and\u000d\u000a      colleagues at Edge Hill\u000d\u000a      University published in 1995 was first raised in the House of Commons by\u000d\u000a      Colin Pickthall MP\u000d\u000a      (Other Source 3). Subsequently, in 2011 (Other Source 4) Andy Burnham MP\u000d\u000a      cited Scraton's 1999\u000d\u000a      book when identifying how the `lie [that] Liverpool fans were to blame'\u000d\u000a      was established. Later, in\u000d\u000a      2012, Andy Burnham MP acknowledged Scraton's work as the key work\u000d\u000a      influencing the\u000d\u000a      Independent Panel's findings (Other Source 5).\u000d\u000a    Community impact: the work of Scraton and his personal commitment\u000d\u000a      to the struggle resulted in\u000d\u000a      a close relationship with the Hillsborough families resulting in him being\u000d\u000a      highly trusted by them (as\u000d\u000a      reported, Other Source 6). As set out in the Panel's report, the newly\u000d\u000a      disclosed material has added\u000d\u000a      to and altered the public's understanding of the disaster, with impact on\u000d\u000a      families, survivors and the\u000d\u000a      wider community. The underlying research at Edge Hill by Scraton and\u000d\u000a      colleagues is cited in the\u000d\u000a      media as the key influence for the Hillsborough Independent Panel (as\u000d\u000a      reported, Other Sources\u000d\u000a      7-8). The work by Scraton and colleagues at Edge Hill is acknowledged by\u000d\u000a      the Chair of the\u000d\u000a      Independent Panel, The Right Rev. James Jones, who commented in 2013, `I\u000d\u000a      accept only a few\u000d\u000a      invitations to speak about the work of the Hillsborough Independent Panel.\u000d\u000a      I choose the occasions\u000d\u000a      thoughtfully.

Phil was a member of the Panel\u000d\u000a      and his knowledge and\u000d\u000a      research expertise were central to the Panel's work' (Other Source 9).\u000d\u000a    Legal impact: a significant early impact of the Panel's findings\u000d\u000a      was that all of the original inquest\u000d\u000a      verdicts of accidental death were quashed in the High Court in December\u000d\u000a      2012, with new inquests\u000d\u000a      ordered (Other Source 10).

This case study only relates to\u000d\u000a      research prior to\u000d\u000a      Scraton joining QUB. To provide context, according to Scraton (1999b:\u000d\u000a      273):\u000d\u000a    The Hillsborough disaster happened at a premier United Kingdom soccer\u000d\u000a        stadium in April\u000d\u000a        1989 claiming the lives of ninety-six men, women, and children. Over the\u000d\u000a        next decade there\u000d\u000a        followed a Home Offb01ce inquiry, a criminal investigation, compensation\u000d\u000a        hearings as far as\u000d\u000a        the House of Lords, the longest inquests in recent history, a judicial\u000d\u000a        review, a judicial\u000d\u000a        scrutiny, and private prosecutions ... Despite the evidence amassed,\u000d\u000a        much of it undisclosed,\u000d\u000a        the legal argument and offb01cial discourse, the bereaved and survivors\u000d\u000a        remain deeply\u000d\u000a        concerned that the `truth' of Hillsborough has been suppressed and\u000d\u000a        reconstructed.\u000d\u000a    The Edge Hill team led by Scraton were the first academics to take a\u000d\u000a      critical view of the evidence\u000d\u000a      associated with the Hillsborough Disaster, challenging the official\u000d\u000a      version. The underpinning\u000d\u000a      research for this impact case study discovered that South Yorkshire Police\u000d\u000a      Officers' evidence of\u000d\u000a      the Hillsborough disaster had been altered and reviewed. Usual practice of\u000d\u000a      recording evidence in\u000d\u000a      police notebooks was not followed. Instead, unsigned and un-witnessed\u000d\u000a      \"personal recollections\"\u000d\u000a      were collected. Although officers had not believed their recollections\u000d\u000a      would become templates for\u000d\u000a      their formal legal statements, this was in fact what transpired via a\u000d\u000a      process of scrutiny by police\u000d\u000a      solicitors. This information was uncovered when Scraton interviewed PC\u000d\u000a      Frost from South\u000d\u000a      Yorkshire Police. Subsequently PC Frost gave evidence to the Stuart-Smith\u000d\u000a      Scrutiny in October\u000d\u000a      1997. The process of this information coming to light is recounted in\u000d\u000a      Scraton's book Hillsborough:\u000d\u000a        The Truth (1999a).\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research by Scraton and colleagues at Edge Hill\u000d\u000a      University was the first to\u000d\u000a      discover the practices noted above and to expose serious anomalies between\u000d\u000a      police officers'\u000d\u000a      original experiences and the evidence they later put before official\u000d\u000a      inquiries. Scraton and\u000d\u000a      colleagues' work also raised the question of whether &#8212; and to what extent &#8212; other documentation was altered or suppressed. The importance of this research (and of later\u000d\u000a      work carried out at QUB)\u000d\u000a      was reflected in Scraton's appointment to the Hillsborough Independent\u000d\u000a      Panel in 2010, which\u000d\u000a      reported in 2012.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43762","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The following impacts were generated between January 2008 and July 2013,\u000a      each flowing from the provision of expert advice.

Ten\u000a      experts from Europe were appointed, with only two from the UK. Parrish was\u000a      the only lawyer in the group. The Group met with Commission officials\u000a      twice in Brussels and produced a report advising the Commission on the\u000a      general themes and specific priorities that should be contained in the\u000a      Commission's `Communication on Sport' (see Section 5, Other Sources 1).\u000a      The Communication set out the Commission's approach to implementing\u000a      Article 165 TFEU. The recommendations made by the Group were accepted by\u000a      the Commission and formed the basis of the subsequent Communication on\u000a      Sport entitled: `Developing the European Dimension of Sport' (see Section\u000a      5, Other Sources 2).\u000a    Impact 2 &#8212; Expert advice informs EU sports legislation: Following\u000a      the Communication, the two legislative chambers of the EU, the Council of\u000a      the European Union and the European Parliament, adopted two Resolutions in\u000a      response to the Communication. A Resolution is a legal instrument setting\u000a      out the legislature's jointly held views and intentions regarding the\u000a      overall merits of the policy and the performance of the specific tasks\u000a      contained in the Communication. The Council adopted a Resolution `On a\u000a      European Union Work Plan for Sport for 2011-2014' (see Section 5, Other\u000a      Sources 3). In the Resolution, the 27 Member States endorsed the priority\u000a      themes identified by the Group of Independent European Sports Experts and\u000a      \"[w]elcome(d) the Commission's Communication on Developing the European\u000a      Dimension in Sport and the main fields of action within its thematic\u000a      chapters...\". Simultaneously, the European Parliament adopted its own\u000a      Resolution on the Communication (see Section 5, Other Sources 4). The\u000a      Resolution endorsed many of the priority themes contained in the\u000a      Communication. In preparation for its vote on the Resolution, the European\u000a      Parliament commissioned a Study on `The Lisbon Treaty and EU Sports\u000a      Policy' (see Section 5, Other Sources 5). The study was co-authored by\u000a      Parrish and he presented its findings to the European Parliament (Culture\u000a      Committee), September 28th 2010, in Brussels. On the role of the expert\u000a      group (impact 1) and the European Parliament study (impact 2), the\u000a      Commission stated: \"while preparing this Communication, the Commission\u000a      consulted with a wide range of stakeholders to identify key themes to be\u000a      addressed at EU level, including consultations with Member States and key\u000a      sport stakeholders (EU Sport Forum, bilateral consultations), an online\u000a      consultation and an independent expert group. It has also\u000a      taken account of the results of a study on \"The Lisbon Treaty and\u000a          EU Sports Policy\" commissioned by the European Parliament\u000a      (European Commission Communication on Sport, 18\/01\/11, p.2\/3, emphasis\u000a      added.

As a means of\u000a      influencing the UK Government's position on EU sports policy in\u000a      preparation for the Council's Resolution, the House of Lords launched an\u000a      inquiry into EU sports policy. Parrish was appointed Special Advisor to\u000a      the House of Lords EU Select Committee (Sub-Committee G: EU Social and\u000a      Consumer Policies), Inquiry into Grassroots Sport and the EU (Nov 2010 &#8212; April 2011). Meeting weekly in Westminster, Parrish briefied the Chairman\u000a      and the Committee members verbally and in writing, provided questions for\u000a      oral evidence sessions, read and assessed evidence, attended committee\u000a      meetings and drafted the final report (see Section 5, Other Sources 6).\u000a      The government responded to the report in April 2011 and the European\u000a      Commission officially responded in September 2011. The report was debated\u000a      on the chamber floor in November 2011 and recorded in Hansard, with two\u000a      references to Parrish, in Vol.732, No.221, Thursday 10 November 2011 at\u000a      page 420-441. In a factual statement, the Chairman of the Select Committee\u000a      wrote: \"In your case, our committee's analyst and clerk were aware of your\u000a      research and its relevance to our enquiry through your publications\u000a      including Sports Law and Policy in the European Union and The\u000a        Sporting Exception in European Union Law and through your\u000a      participation in conferences and seminars\".

These books\u000a      also dealt with the question of whether the EU Treaty required an article\u000a      on sport as a means of resolving on-going problems, so the fit between\u000a      your research and our aims in pursuing the issue of sport and the EU was\u000a      excellent\"... \"I am pleased to report that the Government gave careful\u000a      consideration to our report and concurred with most of our\u000a      recommendations, thanking the Select Committee for making a timely\u000a      contribution to on-going debates\"... \"I am pleased to say that your input &#8212; written and oral &#8212; was of the highest order and greatly contributed to\u000a      the seriousness with which the report was read\"... \"At least one member of\u000a      the sub-committee had initially questioned whether the subject of\u000a      grassroots sport was a serious enough topic for the Committee to consider.\u000a      You should take much of the credit for changing that Member's view to the\u000a      point where he was prepared to explain its imporatnce to other doubting\u000a      peers\" (see Section 5, Factual Statements 1).\u000a    Impact 4 &#8212; Expert advice informs the European Commission's post-Lisbon\u000a        approach to nationality discrimination in European sport: As part of\u000a      the post-Lisbon sports agenda, the Commission funded two studies into\u000a      nationality discrimination in sport. The first concerned discrimination\u000a      against non-nationals in individual sporting competitions. Parrish\u000a      co-authored the study as the high level EU sports law expert (see Section\u000a      5, Other Sources 7). The study provided advice, inter alia, on the impact\u000a      of Article 165 TFEU on the ability of sports bodies to discriminate\u000a      against athletes on the grounds of their nationality. This was a European\u000a      Commission priority project as outlined in its 2007 White Paper on Sport\u000a      (see Section 5, Other Sources 8). The second study stemmed from a\u000a      commitment contained in the 2011 Communication on Sport, in which the\u000a      Commission committed itself to \"assess the consequences of rules on\u000a      home-grown players in team sports in 2012\" (See Section 5, Other Sources\u000a      2). Parrish co-authored the study as the high level EU and sports law\u000a      expert. The study was delivered to the Commission in December 2012 and was\u000a      published in August 2013 (see Section 5, Other Sources 9). Parrish\u000a      delivered the findings of the study to the European Commission's Technical\u000a      Committee on Free Movement of Workers (11\/04\/2013). The results of the\u000a      studies have informed Commission policy in this field and improved\u000a      dialogue between the Commission and sports stakeholders.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European\u000a      Union (TFEU) in December 2009 granted the European Union a competence to\u000a      develop a sports policy.

He continued that `all future\u000a      legal analysis will be impoverished if it ignores his framework' (Sports\u000a        Law Bulletin, 2003 6(4), July\/August). Stephen Weatherill (Oxford)\u000a      commented that the book has `done a great service to scholarship' and that\u000a      the core of the thesis is a `valuable framework for analysis' which is\u000a      `advanced with care and skill' (International Sports Law Journal,\u000a      2006 3\/4).

'Sports Law and Policy in the European Union'\u000a      (2003) was the first systematic and theoretically informed English\u000a      language monograph to explore this area. Similarly, 'The Politics of\u000a      Sports Regulation in the European Union' (2003) was the first sports\u000a      article to be published in the Journal of European Public Policy. These\u000a      works, and 'The Sporting Exception in European Union Law' (2008),\u000a      systematically explored the relationship between EU internal market law\u000a      and sport, the sources of legal uncertainty in the sports sector, the\u000a      meaning of the 'specificity of sport', EU policy priorities for the\u000a      sector, and whether Treaty reform could stabilise the relationship between\u000a      sport and EU law. The works concluded that legal disputes within the\u000a      sports sector could be effectively managed within the framework of EU law\u000a      without undermining the specificities of sport. This research established\u000a      Parrish as a key expert in the field and led to his participation in a\u000a      number of EU research projects, the quality of published outputs and the\u000a      expertise of the research team being criteria for the award of competitive\u000a      EU tenders:\u000a    \u000a      A European Parliament report informing MEPs on the impact of the TFEU\u000a        on EU sports law and policy (2010) (see Section 5, Other Sources 5).\u000a        This report drew heavily on the findings in 'The Sporting Exception in\u000a        European Union Law' (2008). The report made recommendations on EU\u000a        priorities in the area of sport that were subsequently adopted by the\u000a        Commission in its Communication on Sport and endorsed by the Member\u000a        States and the Parliament in two Resolutions on the Communication (June\u000a        2011 &amp; Feb 2012 respectively).\u000a      Two European Commission reports examining nationality discrimination\u000a        in individual sports (2010) (see Section 5, Other Sources 7) and alleged\u000a        nationality discrimination in European professional football &#8212; `the\u000a        home-grown players' study (2013) (see Section 5, Other Sources 9).\u000a    \u000a    The underpinning research and the contribution made to the above EU\u000a      projects resulted in Parrish being appointed to two senior advisory roles:\u000a    \u000a      Participation in the 2010 European Parliament study led to Parrish\u000a        being appointed Special Advisor to the House of Lords EU Select\u000a        Committee (Sub-Committee G: EU Social and Consumer Policies) Inquiry\u000a        into Grassroots Sport and the EU (Nov 2010 &#8212; April 2011) (see Section 5,\u000a        Other Sources 6). The approach to join the inquiry was made by the Clerk\u000a        of the Committee following a presentation on the report made by Parrish\u000a        at the Oval Cricket Ground in London in October 2010. An interview\u000a        conducted by Baronness Young of Hornsea in the Palace of Westminster\u000a        confirmed the appointment.\u000a      Parrish was appointed by European Commissioner Vassiliou to the Group\u000a        of Independent European Sports Experts (2010). The group produced a\u000a        report for the Commission recommending general themes and specific\u000a        priorities for EU action in sport (see Section 5, Other Sources 1).\u000a        These themes were endorsed by the Commission in its Communication on\u000a        Sport (see Section 5, Other Sources 2).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43902","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2464461","Name":"Tunisia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The HEAL network at Southampton has over 70 members, comprising one third\u000a      healthcare and law practitioners. Using research expertise developed by\u000a      Montgomery, Jones and Biggs, HEAL has made a substantive impact on\u000a      policymaking and professional guidance in the UK.\u000a    HEAL's responses to public consultations are often quoted. The Department\u000a      of Health highlighted HEAL's conclusion that a relevant governance\u000a      structure for prescribing was already in place in Summary of Public\u000a      Consultation on Proposals to Introduce Independent Prescribing by\u000a      Physiotherapists [5.1]. The equivalent report for podiatrists cited HEAL's\u000a      view that proposals provided \"good opportunities to ensure and enhance\u000a      responsiveness to patient need\" [5.2]. Liberating the NHS (2010 para 4.79)\u000a      [5.3], quoted HEAL to support its policy that \"consortia should have a key\u000a      role in helping improve quality of GP services\". The Nuffield Council on\u000a      Bioethics cited HEAL's response in Human Bodies (2010 p.88) [5.4], noting\u000a      \"the demand for female egg donation is potentially limitless\". Jones was a\u000a      lead reviewer for the legal aspects of the NCoB's report Novel Techniques\u000a      for the Prevention of Mitochondrial DNA Disorders (2012) [5.5].\u000a    Montgomery's research on bioethics governance (2002 ch 21; 2013) has\u000a      informed the strategic plans of three key bodies that he has chaired,\u000a      appointed in open national competition: the Human Genetics Commission\u000a      (2009-12), Nuffield Council on Bioethics (2012-) and Health Research\u000a      Authority (2012-) [5.6]. His work with the latter was commended by Lord\u000a      Turnberg in the second reading of the Care Bill 2013 [5.7]. Montgomery has\u000a      shared best practice with organisations overseas. Representing the NCoB,\u000a      he spoke about the UK's approach to public ethics at a WHO meeting in\u000a      Tunisia and to the Italian National Bioethics Commission [5.8].\u000a    HEAL hosted Robert Francis QC, within a month of his report on NHS\u000a      failures in Mid-Staffordshire being published (in conjunction with law\u000a      firm Hickman Rose and the Centre for Law, Ethics And Globalisation). This\u000a      brought Southampton researchers and students together with senior NHS\u000a      regional leaders to discuss the issues with Francis, and was used by\u000a      Montgomery to provide a confidential briefing on what had been learned to\u000a      senior civil servants and legal advisors supporting the formulation of the\u000a      Government's response [5.9].\u000a    Montgomery's research on NHS law (2002 chs 3-5) and board-level\u000a      experience in NHS organisations led to invitations to discuss legislative\u000a      reform; including a keynote presentation to 250 opinion formers at Age\u000a      Concern Hampshire's AGM, regular briefings to the Hampshire Senate on how\u000a      changes would impact locally and participation in a \"health leaders'\u000a      roundtable\", organised by Beachcroft Solicitors and Health Investor\u000a      Magazine [5.10].\u000a    Southampton's research has informed professional guidelines. Biggs drew\u000a      on her research to work with the General Medical Council on its Treatment\u000a      and care towards the end of life (2010) [5.11], the most significant UK\u000a      guidance on this area. Montgomery drafted the legal sections of the\u000a      revised British Society for Human Genetics guidance Genetic Testing of\u000a      Children (2010) [5.12] based upon his research into parents' and\u000a      children's rights. This guidance is accepted as good practice and was the\u000a      basis for the court's decision in X CC v Y &amp; Z [2013] EWHC 953 (Fam)\u000a      [5.13].\u000a    Biggs and Montgomery have researched when `broad consent' might be\u000a      legally effective. This led to Montgomery (with Professor Lucassen, HEAL\u000a      member from Medicine) presenting proposals to the HGC in 2010, the\u000a      Government's Human Genomics Strategy Group in 2011 [5.14], drafting\u000a      chapter 8 (Developing the legal and ethical framework) of the latter's\u000a      report, Building on our inheritance: genomic technology in healthcare\u000a      [5.15] (2012) and participating in the group advising the Chief Medical\u000a      Officer on ethical and legal issues of the 100,000 genome project\u000a      (announced by the Prime Minister in December 2012) [5.16]. Biggs is Ethics\u000a      Advisor to the Wales Cancer Bank Advisory Board [5.17].\u000a    Part of HEAL's impact strategy is to promote rigorous and informed public\u000a      debate. The HEAL blog and Twitter feed [5.18] cover current issues,\u000a      drawing on the members' research. Its 130-plus followers include the Daily\u000a      Telegraph medical editor and sixth form students at a Leicestershire\u000a      academy. The blog is designed to attract media enquiries. During the REF\u000a      period, HEAL members have given interviews to Radio 4's Today programme,\u000a      Radio Five Live, Sky and BBC News, as well as local television and radio.\u000a      The front page of the Times on November 24, 2009 [5.19] quoted Montgomery\u000a      discussing the HGC's report on the forensic DNA database (also covered in\u000a      the Guardian). The Daily Mail quoted from Biggs' Today Programme interview\u000a      on 12 July 2013 [5.20] In March 2012, Biggs took part in a public debate\u000a      on euthanasia at the Brighton Dome, with an audience of over 120 [5.21],\u000a      and Montgomery gave a public lecture at Portsmouth Cathedral on how faith\u000a      groups could respond to the changing architecture of governance in\u000a      bioethics [5.22].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research in Southampton Law School's Health Ethics and Law (HEAL) network\u000a      has made a significant contribution to improving the way in which ethical\u000a      issues in health are addressed in the UK and further afield.

Established by Jonathan Montgomery (1984-) and Caroline\u000a      Jones (2003-) in 2005, it collaborates to improve the way in which ethical\u000a      and legal issues concerning health are addressed in the UK.\u000a    The underlying principles were outlined in Montgomery's textbook Health\u000a      Care Law [3.1], which for the first time examined how the law in England\u000a      and Wales governed the full spectrum of health care, not merely medical\u000a      ethics. It contended that sociological and political factors need to be\u000a      considered alongside ethical arguments, arguing that health care law is an\u000a      area in which analysis of the institutional context and governance\u000a      structures is as important as substantive bioethical questions. This work\u000a      was described by the Journal of Medical Ethics as `some of the most\u000a      important and interesting legal analysis of medical law as a discipline'.\u000a    The notion that closer attention should be paid to how ethical issues are\u000a      regulated by legal and other softer normative structures underpinned\u000a      subsequent research led by Montgomery, Jones and Hazel Biggs, appointed at\u000a      Southampton in 2009. Montgomery continued to develop his ideas around\u000a      governance, including of ethical debates over assisted suicide and organ\u000a      donation, publishing 7 book chapters and 8 journal papers between 2002 and\u000a      2013. His Reflections on the nature of public ethics, published in 2013\u000a      [3.2], reflected on his own experience as a member of the Organ Donation\u000a      Taskforce, after it chose not to propose a `presumed consent' model for\u000a      organ donation, as well as other bodies and committees governing bioethics\u000a      in the UK. He identified four areas for future consideration in the\u000a      exploration of public ethics, including the need to take into account\u000a      contemporary policy debates and to assess how positions will be\u000a      represented in the media.\u000a    Adopting a similar approach, Jones' research in 2005 centred on donor\u000a      insemination and its implications for family law. A study of British\u000a      lesbian families using licensed donor insemination explored the\u000a      construction of implied bio-genetic links between donor-conceived children\u000a      and co-mothers, and to co-mother's extended families. In her 2007 book she\u000a      concluded that donor insemination requires developments in family law and\u000a      new definitions of parenthood [3.3]. The research [3.4] widened to an\u000a      analysis of the routes by which parliamentary bodies move from\u000a      consultation to formulating public policy on the issue of assisted\u000a      conception, revealing how the connection between consultation and policy\u000a      is less objective than is often claimed. It also teased out the\u000a      complexities and ambiguities of the legal provisions that resulted [3.5].\u000a    Biggs' 2009 research [3.6] explored the relationship between law and\u000a      ethics in the context of medical research in order to provide a practical\u000a      guide for members of research ethics committees, which review around 6,000\u000a      research applications each year for the Health Research Authority. Later\u000a      research [3.7] studied the implications of new guidelines published by the\u000a      Director of Public Prosecutions for cases of encouraging or assisting\u000a      suicide and suggested that a permissive change in the law would provide\u000a      better safeguards for those who seek assisted dying. Montgomery also\u000a      examined the implications of this development for constitutional theory\u000a      [3.8]\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43903","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The IML's research has had a continuing impact on analysis and assessment\u000a      of the development\u000a      of a new international liability regime for maritime and multi-modal\u000a      transport operators. Formally\u000a      titled the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\u000a      Carriage of Goods Wholly or\u000a      Partly by Sea, the Rotterdam Rules were approved by the UN General\u000a      Assembly on 11 December\u000a      2008, with a signing ceremony held in Rotterdam on 23 September 2009.\u000a      Despite initial fears that\u000a      the United States was preparing instead to act unilaterally, by updating\u000a      their own regulatory\u000a      regime, the US did take part in the drafting of the Rotterdam Rules and\u000a      signed them, as did eight\u000a      European nations involved in maritime transport. In all, signatures were\u000a      obtained from 25 countries\u000a      making up 25% of world trade volume. The Rules will come into force when\u000a      they are ratified by 20\u000a      countries. Seen by some as a vital step in modernising the system upon\u000a      which world trade\u000a      depends, the new Rules represent a possible international solution to the\u000a      many problems and\u000a      limitations of the existing regimes, which fail to address important\u000a      issues such as door-to-door\u000a      transport and electronic transport documents. The new Rules also\u000a      facilitate e-commerce, are more\u000a      detailed on shippers' obligations to make cargo ready for carriage, and\u000a      contain very specific\u000a      provisions on carriers' delivery obligations, while providing them with\u000a      the right to limit liability for all\u000a      breaches of their obligations under the Rules. At the same time, the Rules\u000a      support the principle of\u000a      freedom of contract between the parties and adopt a limited network\u000a      liability system which ensures,\u000a      to some degree, the absence of conflict with other unimodal carriage\u000a      compulsory regimes.\u000a    The new Rules were influenced by the IML's research for the EU\u000a      Commission, in particular the two\u000a      reports proposing a new uniform liability regime: Intermodal\u000a      Transportation and Carrier Liability\u000a      (1999), and Implementation of the Freight Integrator Action Plan (2006).\u000a      Numerous references to\u000a      these reports can be found in EU Commission working papers and policy\u000a      statements (5.1, 5.2, 5.3,\u000a      5.4). The possibility of the EU developing its own, separate regulatory\u000a      system was instrumental in\u000a      pushing other players to agree a new worldwide system, and references to\u000a      the IML's research can\u000a      also be found in policy documents of the United Nations Commission for\u000a      Trade and Development,\u000a      UNCTAD (5.5, 5.6, 5.7). The 2006 Action Plan, and the lengthy industry\u000a      consultation that followed,\u000a      steered the UN towards shifting the focus of the Rotterdam Rules from\u000a      maritime transport only to\u000a      what is now known as a \"maritime plus\" approach.\u000a    The IML has been involved in drafting key industry documents to help\u000a      inform and prepare legal\u000a      practitioners for the impact of the new Rules. The IML's John Dunt was a\u000a      member of the drafting\u000a      group which produced the 2009 Institute Cargo Clauses (ICC), the current\u000a      industry standard for\u000a      cargo insurance. Professor Charles Debattista chaired the Incoterms 2010\u000a      International Drafting\u000a      Group, drawing up internationally accepted definitions and interpretations\u000a      for most common\u000a      commercial terms involved in the delivery of goods from sellers to buyers.\u000a      These rules, published\u000a      by the International Chamber of Commerce, are widely used in commercial\u000a      transactions. Filippo\u000a      Lorenzon of the IML formulated the UK submissions to this Group.\u000a    Other examples of the IML's continued involvement in policy formulation\u000a      and implementation\u000a      include being asked in 2010 by the UK government to help draw up the\u000a      British Maritime Law\u000a      Association's position on the Rotterdam Rules, and provide expert advice\u000a      on their ratification for\u000a      the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Services. Filippo Lorenzon\u000a      has become Senior\u000a      Legal Advisor to the World Bank and has been asked to draft Egypt's law on\u000a      multi-modal transport.\u000a    His contribution to the World Bank has drawn praise from Periklis\u000a      Saragiotis (5.8), a Private Sector\u000a      Development Specialist for the Bank's Trade Logistics division, who said:\u000a      \"Lorenzon's expertise in\u000a      multimodal transport law and his deep understanding of the connections\u000a      between the law and\u000a      practice of multimodal carriage and its socio-economic implications have\u000a      been crucial for the\u000a      success of our broader Trade Logistics project in Egypt and specifically\u000a      for its Multimodal\u000a      Component. In this context, Lorenzon's expertise will be essential for the\u000a      improvement of Egypt's\u000a      multimodal legislative and regulatory framework and its alignment to\u000a      regional and international best\u000a      practices.\"\u000a    The IML runs regular Continuing Professional Development courses on the\u000a      legal impact of the\u000a      Rotterdam Rules, and held two workshops in London in 2009 on the practical\u000a      implications for\u000a      transport and insurance practitioners. Professor Yvonne Baatz helped the\u000a      British Maritime Law\u000a      Association organise a similar workshop designed to raise awareness among\u000a      the legal profession.\u000a      The President of the British Maritime Law Association, Mr Andrew Taylor,\u000a      thanking the speakers,\u000a      including Professor Baatz, for their work on the seminar said: \"I judge it\u000a      to have been a very\u000a      successful event. It was well attended indeed. More importantly your\u000a      contributions were of the\u000a      highest quality. This is what I wanted the BMLA to put on: a high level\u000a      analysis. In turn it generated\u000a      a stimulating debate with the audience.\" The IML has also published the\u000a      first complete commentary\u000a      on the new Rules (5.9), a work which has been extensively cited by legal\u000a      experts leading the\u000a      international debate on the subject. For example, key industry handbooks\u000a      such as Carver on bills\u000a        of lading by Guenter Treitel and F. M. B. Reynolds (3rd edition),\u000a      London 2012, and The Rotterdam\u000a        Rules: The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage\u000a        of Goods Wholly or Partly\u000a        by Sea, by Michael Sturley, Tomotaka Fujita and Gertjan van der\u000a      Ziel, London 2010, contain\u000a      numerous references to the research work of the IML.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The University of Southampton's Institute of Maritime Law (IML) has\u000a      played a significant role in the\u000a      development of a new international convention which, if it comes into\u000a      force, may govern the $18\u000a      trillion global containerized trade. Southampton researchers contributed\u000a      substantially to the debate\u000a      underpinning the new global liability regime devised to replace a system\u000a      which has struggled to\u000a      keep up with the pace of technological change. The new international legal\u000a      regime &#8212; the so-called\u000a      Rotterdam Rules &#8212; has dramatically altered the scope of regulatory\u000a      intervention in the sector and\u000a      affected the rights and liabilities of shippers, carriers, receivers and\u000a      insurers across maritime and\u000a      multimodal transport worldwide. A global provider of CPD training, the IML\u000a      continues to play an\u000a      important part in explaining the new Rules to industry players and\u000a      advising on how best to cope\u000a      with the impact of future change.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    University of Southampton\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Southampton (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Southampton","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007158}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2747891","Name":"Rotterdam"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1 Asariotis R., Tsimplis, M.N., The proposed US Carriage of Goods by\u000a      Sea Act [1999] LMCLQ\u000a      126-164; a response to which was published as Sturley, M., Proposed\u000a      amendments to the US\u000a      Carriage of Goods by Sea Act: a response to English criticisms [1999]\u000a      LMCLQ 519-529; this led to\u000a      a further reply: Asariotis R., Tsimplis, M.N., Proposed amendments to the\u000a      US Carriage of Goods\u000a      by Sea Act: a reply to Professor Sturley's response [1999] Lloyd's\u000a      Maritime and Commercial Law\u000a      Quarterly 530-535\u000a    \u000a\u000a3.2 Asariotis, R., UNCITRAL (draft) convention on contracts for the\u000a      international carriage of goods\u000a      wholly or partly by sea: mandatory rules and freedom of contract.

Since the\u000a      containers are designed for multi-modal carriage, that is they can be\u000a      transhipped from one means\u000a      of transport to another (ships, trucks, trains) without unpacking their\u000a      contents, they have had a\u000a      huge impact in reducing carriage costs of goods while increasing speed,\u000a      volume and efficiency. In\u000a      2012 the World Trade Organisation estimated that more than 90 per cent of\u000a      global trade, worth\u000a      some $18 trillion, was carried in containers, almost all using more than\u000a      one mode of transport.\u000a      However, international regulation has failed to keep up with the pace of\u000a      change and, since the\u000a      1970s, the lack of a global or even regional regime setting out the duties\u000a      and liabilities of multi-\u000a      modal transport operators has been identified as an obstacle to world\u000a      trade both by the United\u000a      Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and by the European\u000a      Union.\u000a    The European Commission asked the IML to undertake research in 1998-99\u000a      and 2005-06. The\u000a      work was funded by consultancy contracts between the IML and the\u000a      Commission. The researchers\u000a      examined some of the fundamental assumptions made in the past by\u000a      reformers, notably whether a\u000a      uniform liability system was preferable to the traditional network\u000a      approach adopted by the most\u000a      common standard form contracts in use. A critical aim was to reconcile the\u000a      positions of carriers and\u000a      shippers\/receivers, that is those providing transport services and those\u000a      paying for such services,\u000a      with all the complications arising from issues such as liability for items\u000a      lost or damaged, and the\u000a      related insurance issues. It was felt by some that technological\u000a      advancement required a revision of\u000a      the existing international regulatory framework, the so-called Hague and\u000a      Hague-Visby Rules,\u000a      dating back to 1924. One key driver of change was the impact of electronic\u000a      commerce; how could\u000a      bills of lading and other transport documents be translated into\u000a      instruments of trade suitable for the\u000a      age of the internet?\u000a    Dr Regina Asariotis, who left the IML in 2002, was the principal\u000a      investigator for the 1998-99\u000a      research (3.1, 3.4, 3.5) and led the consultations it involved with\u000a      industry players. Together with\u000a      Mikis Tsimplis, Professor of Law and Ocean Sciences, her work focused on\u000a      American resistance to\u000a      international uniformity. Their conclusions were critical of the US draft\u000a      statute, the Carriage of\u000a      Goods by Sea Act (COGSA) 1999, which set out to define unilaterally the\u000a      balance of rights and\u000a      responsibilities between shippers of cargo and ship-owners involved in\u000a      transport to and from the\u000a      US. Filippo Lorenzon, who joined the IML in 2002 and is its current\u000a      director, led the 2005-06\u000a      research (3.2, 3.3, 3.6), which also included industry consultations and\u000a      international academic\u000a      exchanges. Other researchers were Yvonne Baatz, Professor of Maritime Law,\u000a      who joined\u000a      Southampton in 1991, Charles Debattista, who joined in 1982 and was\u000a      Professor of Commercial\u000a      Law until 2011, Professor Hilton Staniland, who joined in 2008, Dr Andrew\u000a      Serdy, a Reader in law\u000a      who joined in 2005, and John Dunt, a Senior Visiting Research fellow who\u000a      joined in 2008.\u000a    Published in 2009, The Rotterdam Rules: a practical annotation,\u000a      is the fruit of cooperative research\u000a      within the IML, and has lead to a number of subsequent articles on the\u000a      topic. The work is\u000a      frequently cited in academic research and the criticisms made in these\u000a      publications are implicitly\u000a      addressed in policy papers worldwide.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43904","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Bill that led to the Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 1930\u000a      was described as a measure that would \"commend itself to all quarters of\u000a      the House\" (Hansard, October 29 1929, volume 231, column 128). This proved\u000a      to be the case, but the Act increasingly failed to keep pace with the\u000a      changing landscape of insurance and insolvency.\u000a    The Act applied where a person or company took out liability insurance.\u000a      If the insured became liable to another person - a third party - the\u000a      latter would ordinarily be able to sue the insured, with the liability\u000a      covered by the insurer; but under common law the third party was unable to\u000a      proceed if the insured became insolvent (instead becoming a general\u000a      creditor). The Act transferred the insured's rights under the insurance\u000a      policy to the third party, enabling direct proceedings against the\u000a      insurer.\u000a    Over the years the Act attracted mounting concern over its encouragement\u000a      of time-consuming procedures and unnecessary costs. The principal purpose\u000a      of the 2010 Act was to make it easier, quicker and less expensive for a\u000a      third-party claimant to recover compensation from an insurer without first\u000a      having to institute proceedings against the insured. Merkin was one of the\u000a      1930 Act's foremost critics, drawing on his research to argue for the need\u000a      for change and personally directing the Law Commission's attention to its\u000a      shortcomings - detailed in a 20-point letter - after the legislation was\u000a      spared immediate reform in a wider investigation into privity of contract\u000a      in 1991.\u000a    Merkin's research thus led directly to the new Act, playing a key role in\u000a      shaping the legislation so as to correct the defects of its predecessor.\u000a      His expertise in this field, demonstrated in written and oral evidence,\u000a      provided a point-by-point basis for the House of Lords Committee to\u000a      determine the feasibility of the new Act and to ensure the Bill could be\u000a      passed quickly and without the need for a debate (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4).\u000a      This process represented peer review in every sense, with the Committee\u000a      comprised of retired Law Lords, QCs, former cabinet ministers and other\u000a      Lords with extensive knowledge of the law. Law Commissioner David Hertzell\u000a      and The Right Hon the Lord Mance, former Lord of Appeal and now Justice of\u000a      the Supreme Court, were both heavily involved with the legislative changes\u000a      (5.5). The Rt Hon. the Lord Lloyd of Berwick DL, chairman of the House of\u000a      Lords Special Committee, told Merkin at the end of the hearing: \"It could\u000a      not have gone better.\" The House of Commons passed the Bill in less than\u000a      an hour.\u000a    Chief among the new Act's improvements is that a third party has a direct\u000a      claim against an insured's insurers, ensuring policy moneys go to pay the\u000a      victim's claim instead of being diverted to the insured's other creditors.\u000a      The effects of this should include ensuring the victims of asbestos\u000a      exposure obtain compensation; allowing victims to obtain information as to\u000a      the adequacy of any insurance before proceedings are commenced; and\u000a      preventing insurers from relying on policy conditions affecting claims\u000a      where those conditions have been disregarded by an insolvent insured. It\u000a      is not yet possible to gauge the precise benefits of the revised\u000a      legislation, as the Act has not yet come into force; but they are expected\u000a      - and, indeed, were designed - to be significant. In 2013 the Government\u000a      indicated its intention to amend the Act to introduce further specified\u000a      insolvency situations and then to implement it as soon as is reasonably\u000a      practicable (5.6).\u000a    The new Act met with approval from the wider law industry. For example UK\u000a      law firm Mills and Reeve wrote in 2010 (5.7):\u000a    \"Whilst the new regime is likely to result in more claims from third\u000a      parties, as it will now be possible to bring proceedings first against\u000a      insurers to resolve policy issues, if the policy defence is a good one\u000a      costs should ultimately be saved. In addition, if the policy defence\u000a      fails, insurers will now have ample opportunity to contest both liability\u000a      and quantum of the third party's claim to indemnity under the policy\u000a      rather than being presented with a monetary judgment obtained in default\u000a      against the insolvent insured which simply has to be paid.\"\u000a    A recognised leader in his field, Merkin continued to shape wider\u000a      thinking on insurance law both nationally and internationally. His work on\u000a      the 2010 Act, in addition to being detailed in a House of Lords paper and\u000a      freely downloadable minutes of evidence, forms chapter 21 of the ninth\u000a      edition of Colinvaux's Law of Insurance (2010), described by publisher\u000a      Sweet and Maxwell as the \"essential companion for insurance\u000a      practitioners\".\u000a    Other ILRG members have also contributed to the understanding of the Act\u000a      by those who will need to apply it in their commercial activities through\u000a      articles in practitioner newsletters and journals (Shipping &amp; Trade\u000a        Law, Insurance Law Monthly and Asia Pacific Law Review\u000a      in 2010); the practitioner reference works Marine Insurance: Law and\u000a        Practice (2012); and Insurance Disputes 3rd\u000a        edition (2011); and in the text book Maritime law 2nd\u000a      edition (5.8).\u000a    They have also delivered professional development courses in the UK and\u000a      overseas including on the renowned Short Course in Maritime Law (each year\u000a      from 2010 onwards) for a combined audience of approximately 200 to date.\u000a      The Short Course is provided in Southampton by the Institute of Maritime\u000a      Law for an audience consisting of market practitioners such as solicitors,\u000a      barristers and insurance and shipping professionals each year in August\u000a      and September.\u000a    The Act has also been covered on the Institute of Maritime Law Singapore\u000a      Short Course, which runs in Singapore annually over two weeks in May. The\u000a      Act has been covered in 2012 and 2013 and included in the course materials\u000a      in some previous years. The course is co-organised with the Singapore\u000a      Maritime Foundation and aimed at professionals practicing shipping law in\u000a      Singapore.\u000a    Dr Ozlem Gurses and Professor Paul Todd spoke about the implications of\u000a      the Act at a bespoke course on marine insurance provided to Raets P&amp;I,\u000a      a marine insurer, in the Netherlands on 10-11 June 2013, a two-day\u000a      intensive course on English insurance law. The audience was all members of\u000a      the underwriting team and claims handlers of Raets.\u000a    Most recently, advice on the implications of the Act has been provided to\u000a      a Turkish law practitioner dealing with an insurance policy incorporating\u000a      English law in April 2013. The issue was related to the third party's\u000a      right to bring a direct action against insurer under English law because\u000a      the policy, being on aviation insurance, was based on English standard\u000a      terms of aviation insurance. The same issue was also discussed at the\u000a      conference on liability insurance in Istanbul in March 2013 at which Ozlem\u000a      Gurses was one of the speakers.\u000a    The third party liability insurance market, to which this Act will apply\u000a      once it enters into force, is considerable, even excluding motor insurance\u000a      (which is separately regulated by the Road Traffic Act 1988). According to\u000a      the Association of British Insurers, the UK insurance industry is the\u000a      largest in Europe and the third largest in the world, accounting for 7% of\u000a      total worldwide premium income. About 30% of the UK insurance industry's\u000a      net premium income comes from overseas business, most of which is\u000a      long-term business (&#163;46 billion) (5.9).\u000a    The likely reach of the Act is global, as English law is the law of\u000a      choice for many business insurance policies.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Influential work on insurance law by Professor Rob Merkin led directly to\u000a      the repeal of the outmoded and increasingly unpopular Third Parties\u000a      (Rights Against Insurers) Act 1930. With its predecessor criticised for\u000a      its demands on time and costs, a new Act made it simpler, faster and\u000a      cheaper for a third-party claimant to recover compensation from an insurer\u000a      without instituting proceedings against the insured. Merkin not only drew\u000a      policymakers' attention to the old Act's defects but provided a detailed\u000a      basis on which to formulate its successor, which earned Royal Assent in\u000a      2010.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Legal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Southampton\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Southampton (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Southampton","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007158}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"745044","Name":"Istanbul"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000aColinvaux's Law of Insurance, 9th edition 2010, chapter 21.

Research by the University of Southampton has made a pivotal\u000a      contribution towards highlighting the need for - and helping to shape - a\u000a      new Act.\u000a    Rob Merkin, Professor of Commercial Law at Southampton Law School\u000a      (2000-2012) has been conducting research in the field of insurance law for\u000a      more than 20 years. He co-founded the School's insurance law research\u000a      group (ILRG), now comprising nine members of academic staff; Hjalmarsson\u000a      (Informa Senior Research Fellow in Maritime and Commercial Law joined\u000a      2004), Staniland (Professor of Maritime Law, joined 2007), Gurses (Senior\u000a      Lecturer joined 2010), Lista (Senior Lecturer joined 2008), Rose\u000a      (Professor of Maritime and Commercial Law joined 2012), Hudson (Professor\u000a      of Equity and Finance Law joined 2012), Todd (Professor of Commercial and\u000a      Maritime Law joined 2012), Bek (Research Fellow joined 2013), Steer\u000a      (Research Fellow joined 2013).\u000a    In the early 1990s the English Law Commission reviewed the concept of\u000a      privity of contract in common law, the doctrine that provides that a\u000a      contract cannot confer rights or impose obligations on any person other\u000a      than the parties to it. The 1991 consultation paper, Privity of Contract:\u000a      Contract for the Benefit of Third Parties (Law Commission Consultation\u000a      Paper No. 121), although recommending general reform, remarked: \"There are\u000a      various exceptions to privity, including the 1930 Act, which works very\u000a      well.\"\u000a    Merkin responded by contacting the Commission to highlight the\u000a      deficiencies of the 1930 Act. Following further consultation - including\u000a      with the Law Society's Insurance Law Sub-Committee, of which Merkin was a\u000a      member - the Commission resolved to investigate the Act in full. Merkin\u000a      was asked to supply written evidence, and the Commission's 2002 report,\u000a      Third Parties - Rights Against Insurers (Law Commission Report No. 272),\u000a      referred in detail to both this and his wider work on the issue.\u000a    In the summer of 2009, using a new system for the rapid enactment of Law\u000a      Commission reports, the government decided to implement the 2002 report in\u000a      legislation. A Bill was introduced into the House of Lords in November\u000a      that year. It was important the Bill should not need substantial\u000a      amendment, as this would prevent the use of the new expedited procedure.\u000a      As one of only three people invited by Lord Bach, Parliamentary\u000a      Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice, to give oral evidence\u000a      to a House of Lords Special Committee, Merkin was tasked with\u000a      demonstrating the bill was \"fit for purpose\" as it stood.\u000a    Merkin prepared two reports. The first was used by the Committee as a\u000a      basis for its deliberations. The second offered a point-by-point rebuttal\u000a      of suggestions regarding potential defects in the new legislation, so\u000a      helping remove doubts raised with and by the Committee. The House of Lords\u000a      passed the Bill, publishing a report containing Merkin's written and oral\u000a      evidence (House of Lords Paper No. 58, House of Lords Special Public Bill\u000a      Committee: Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Bill, February 9 2010),\u000a      and the Third Parties (Rights Against Insurers) Act 2010 received Royal\u000a      Assent on March 25 that year.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43961","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Scott at al's research has had impact in the sense of having \"made a\u000a      contribution to critical public debate around policy\" (REF Panel C\u000a      criteria, section C3, para. 80). It was considered by the government\u000a      during the scrutiny of Lord Lester's aborted Defamation Bill 2010 and was\u000a      relied on in the parliamentary debates culminating in the passing of the\u000a      Defamation Act 2013. The research is referred to in numerous parliamentary\u000a      publications, including a House of Commons Library Briefing Paper and\u000a      House of Lords Library Note. Scott relied on it when he gave evidence to\u000a      the Ministry of Justice Libel Working Group and to the Joint Select\u000a      Committee on Defamation.\u000a    The Ministry of Justice Libel Working Group considered the research in\u000a      detail and cited it in its report (section 5, source 1). The research was\u000a      circulated among all MPs and Peers by a lobby group ('Lawyers for Media\u000a      Standards'), and was extensively quoted in a House of Commons Library\u000a      Briefing Paper (section 5, source 2 at p. 4), and in a House of Lords\u000a      Library Note (section 5, source 3, at pp. 3-4, 11 and 12) in advance of\u000a      the Second Reading debate on the Defamation Bill 2010. Elements of the\u000a      argument presented by Lord Triesman during the House of Lords' Second\u000a      Reading debate (section 5, source 4) expressly rely on Mullis and Scott\u000a      2011a.\u000a    Scott was invited in April 2011 to meet with Ministry of Justice\u000a      officials to discuss the Draft Defamation Bill (now Defamation Act 2013)\u000a      and the proposals set out in Mullis and Scott 2012a and 2012b. He also\u000a      gave written and oral evidence to the Joint Select Committee on Defamation\u000a      in May 2011. In its report, the Select Committee cited Scott's evidence\u000a      explicitly and reiterated the central theme of the research when observing\u000a      that:\u000a    the key to reducing costs lies not only in reform of the law but, more\u000a      significantly, in changes to the way it operates in practice.... New\u000a      mechanisms and streamlined procedures are required to enable parties to\u000a      settle disputes more quickly and therefore cheaply (section 5, source 5 at\u000a      para.10).\u000a    (Other core themes of the research, such as \"the importance of the law\u000a      being accessible to the ordinary person\" (section 5, source 5 at para.13)\u000a      are also evident in the Select Committee's report, though they are not\u000a      explicitly linked to the research itself.)\u000a    On the issue of jurisdiction in libel law &#8212; the 'libel tourism' debate &#8212;\u000a      a high level workshop was organised by LSE in January 2009. Participants\u000a      included the Chairman of the House of Commons Select Committee on Culture,\u000a      Media and Sport who indicated that the discussions would bear\u000a      significantly on the subsequent inquiry into Press Standards, Libel\u000a        and Privacy. Following this event, Scott briefed the Select\u000a      Committee in advance of its inquiry, while Hartley advised Ministry of\u000a      Justice officials on the construction of clause 7 of the Draft Defamation\u000a      Bill, which focuses on jurisdiction.\u000a    The Ministry of Justice Libel Working Group (section 5, source 1 esp. at\u000a      pp. 19-21) recommended a single publication rule in preference to the\u000a      defence of non-culpable republication. This matter was reviewed in the\u000a      oral and written evidence submitted by Scott to the Joint Committee. In\u000a      its report, the MoJ Working Group noted explicitly the option of\u000a      introducing a 'non-culpable republication' defence (with reference to\u000a      Scott's evidence), although it ultimately preferred the introduction of\u000a      the alternative rule (section 5, source 5 at para. 58).\u000a    The research has impacted on broader policy debate. For instance, the\u000a      Joint Committee asserted that \"a rapid public correction, explanation or\u000a      apology is often the remedy most valued by the claimant\" (section 5,\u000a      source 5, paras 10 and 30). This is a key proposition to be found in\u000a      Mullis and Scott 2012a (esp. at pp.16-21) and was emphasized by Scott to\u000a      the Committee in written evidence, and was raised specifically in relation\u000a      to internet regulation during the oral evidence session.\u000a    The Joint Committee requested additional evidence from key witnesses on\u000a      the feasibility of the bifurcated approach to the determination of libel\u000a      claims as recommended by Scott (section 5, source 5 vol. II at 21). It\u000a      concluded that:\u000a    the Government [should] explore further the development of a voluntary,\u000a      media-orientated forum for dispute resolution in the context of the\u000a      current review of the regulatory regime governing the media (section 5,\u000a      source 5 para. 84).\u000a    This has become the more broadly preferred option in the wake of the\u000a      widespread public focus on the future of media regulation.\u000a    Finally, in line with a key proposition of Scott's research on the costs\u000a      regime, the Committee recommended that the Government should review its\u000a      current plans afresh \"with a view to protecting further the interests of\u000a      those without substantial financial means\" (section 5, source 5 at p.12\u000a      and para. 89).\u000a    Why the impact matters. Scott et al's research has significantly\u000a      informed discussions and law reform proposals concerning the feasibility\u000a      of a single-publication rule, and appropriate choice-of jurisdiction\u000a      rules, in libel law. Their defence of a revised multiple-publication\u000a      principle &#8212; the proposed new defence of \"non-culpable republication\" &#8212; is\u000a      an important contribution to current legal policy debate.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Scott et al's research has made a contribution to critical public debate\u000a      around libel reform.

All the underpinning\u000a      research has been undertaken since he joined the LSE in 2006. Parts of the\u000a      research were undertaken jointly with Andrew Murray (LSE), Charlie Beckett\u000a      (LSE) and Alastair Mullis (UEA). The research of Trevor Hartley (Emeritus\u000a      Professor, LSE) on libel tourism also formed part of the overall Law\u000a      Department project on libel reform.\u000a    There is, at the heart of nearly all proposals to reform libel law, a\u000a      tension among three competing interests: the rights of publishers, the\u000a      reputation rights of private citizens, and the principle of free speech.\u000a      The prevailing view among law reformers and political campaigners is that\u000a      decisions about how to prioritize these interests must always be put into\u000a      effect through the alteration of existing legal rules. A core claim of\u000a      Scott et al's research is that the prevailing view is right only up to a\u000a      point: libel reform should focus less on amendment of the substantive law\u000a      and more on problems of cost and process (Mullis and Scott 2009a). This\u000a      claim informs Scott et al's analysis of recent legislative initiatives\u000a      (Mullis and Scott 2011a) and has resulted in their putting forward a\u000a      broadly-based a reform agenda which draws on insights from social\u000a      psychology, political philosophy and human rights law and which is\u000a      markedly different from the agenda typically propounded by political\u000a      campaigners (Mullis and Scott 2012b).\u000a    The research has had demonstrable impact on multiple publication rules\u000a      and &#8212; in relation to libel tourism &#8212; on discursive remedies and\u000a      choice-of-jurisdiction rules. As regards multiple publication rules\u000a      (according to which a new cause of action arises each time the same piece\u000a      of defamatory material is published), Scott et al's research suggests that\u000a      a move to a single rule would be unsatisfactory, perhaps unlawful, because\u000a      it would fail to protect reputation. They recommend instead a new defence\u000a      of \"non-culpable republication\" (the recommendation has its origins in\u000a      2009b and is developed in 2011b).\u000a    On the questions of appropriate remedies and choice-of-jurisdiction\u000a      rules, the research provides reasons for and recommends stronger reliance\u000a      on a range of \"discursive remedies\" as opposed to damages. The research\u000a      also recommends a shift away from a court-based process towards a\u000a      simplified, cost-saving decision-making system (Mullis and Scott 2012b).\u000a      Central to Mullis and Scott 2012b is a theoretically-informed proposal for\u000a      a bifurcated approach to the determination of libel claims, with\u000a      determinations being made by \"an appropriately designed self- or statutory\u000a      media-regulator\".\u000a    (On the basis of the research, Scott was elected in December 2011 as\u000a      Academic Fellow of the Inner Temple, a conferral which recognizes inter\u000a        alia the outstanding contribution of the legal research of early- to\u000a      mid-career academics to the Bar of England and Wales.)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43964","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Jackson was appointed to the HFEA in 2003, largely as a result of her\u000a      published research, and most notably her 2001 book, Regulating\u000a        Reproduction. From 2008 to 2012, she was the HFEA's Deputy Chair.\u000a    Since 2003, there has been a number of policy changes in relation to the\u000a      pre-conception welfare principle, all of which have brought it more into\u000a      line with the position advocated in Jackson's 2001 book and 2002 article\u000a      (section 5, sources 1 and 2). In 2005, the HFEA changed its policy on the\u000a      `welfare of the child' assessments that clinics were required to carry out\u000a      before offering treatment. These were transformed into `welfare of the\u000a      child risk assessments', in which the clinic is under a duty to\u000a      consider whether the child is at risk of serious harm, rather than to\u000a      assess whether the would-be parents would be likely to be good parents.\u000a      The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act was subsequently amended (2008)\u000a      so that, instead of requiring clinics to take into account the child's\u000a      `need for a father' before offering treatment, the requirement is now to\u000a      take into account the child's `need for supportive parenting'.\u000a    The impact of Jackson's research can further be seen in the HFEA's 8th\u000a      Code of Practice (which came into force on 1 October 2009). This\u000a      stipulates that clinicians &#8212; so that they might address the supportive\u000a      parenting requirement appropriately &#8212; should be subject to the following\u000a      provision: `It is presumed that all prospective parents will be supportive\u000a      parents, in the absence of any reasonable cause for concern that any child\u000a      who may be born, or any other child, may be at risk of significant harm or\u000a      neglect.' (HFEA 8th Code of Practice, para 8.11).\u000a    Only if there is evidence to back up the assertion that any child to be\u000a      born would be at risk of significant harm and neglect, perhaps because the\u000a      couple have already had previous children taken into care, could a\u000a      clinician justify refusing treatment to a couple or individual on child\u000a      welfare grounds. This means that the process for people seeking fertility\u000a      treatment is now less discriminatory and intrusive. Contrary to previous\u000a      HFEA guidance, clinicians are no longer routinely required to approach a\u000a      potential patient's GP to inquire about their fitness to parent.\u000a    The new process is also less bureaucratic. A recent major piece of\u000a      empirical research, looking at the ways in which child welfare is\u000a      currently assessed in fertility clinics (E. Lee et al, Assessing Child\u000a        Welfare under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act: The New Law\u000a      (section 5, source 4, p.19) cites Jackson's 2002 article as playing an\u000a      important role in stimulating debates over the pre-conception welfare\u000a      principle:\u000a    As outlined in the previous section, the subsequent years saw on-going\u000a      discussion about the problem of `stereotyped opinions' (eventually\u000a      resolved formally through the removal of `the need for a father' as part\u000a      of the wording of s13(5)), and additionally the development of both\u000a      important debate about the desirability and plausibility of assessing `the\u000a      welfare of the child' before conception (see especially Jackson 2002,\u000a      2008) and protracted attempts to develop more meaningful guidance for\u000a      clinics on welfare assessments on the part of the HFEA.... As noted\u000a      previously, some have set out substantive objections to the meaningfulness\u000a      and moral integrity of the statutory demand for `welfare of the child'\u000a      assessments prior to conception (Jackson 2002, 2008).\u000a    According to Professor Lisa Jardine CBE, Chair of the HFEA:\u000a    \"Arguments and material from [Professor Emily Jackson's] research have\u000a      consistently underpinned and supported decisions taken by the Authority.\u000a      She has drawn directly on her research to inform discussions both in\u000a      committee, and in full Authority meetings. I and my members have on a\u000a      number of occasions modified our discussion and decision-making based on\u000a      interventions Professor Jackson has made. I can say with confidence that\u000a      decisions of the HFEA during the period of her membership have depended\u000a      directly on arguments drawn from her research. It is hard to imagine a\u000a      more direct impact of academic research on public business and outcomes\u000a      than this....\u000a    The HFEA's guidance has shifted significantly over the course of Emily\u000a      Jackson's membership of the Authority from a fairly restrictive model\u000a      towards one in which all patients are presumed to be supportive parents,\u000a      in the absence of evidence to the contrary. This shift has been driven by\u000a      a number of factors, one of which is the increasing recognition &#8212; set out\u000a      with particular clarity and force in Jackson's 2001 book and 2002 article\u000a      &#8212; that it is unfair and potentially discriminatory to subject infertile\u000a      people to special scrutiny before they are allowed to make the decision to\u000a      start a family.\" (Section 5, source 1.)\u000a    Jackson's research on the pre-conception welfare principle has also been\u000a      cited in policy documents in other jurisdictions, most notably Victoria,\u000a      Australia (section 5, source 5), where a similar change has taken place:\u000a      see, in particular, Victorian Law Reform Commission, Assisted\u000a        Reproductive Technology and Adoption: Final Report (No. 10 session,\u000a      2007), p. 27 (at\u000a      http:\/\/www.lawreform.vic.gov.au\/projects\/art-adoption\/art-and-adoption-final-report),\u000a      citing Jackson 2001 and her `Fertility Treatment: Abolish the Welfare\u000a      Principle', Spiked 11 June 2003 at\u000a      http:\/\/www.spiked-online.com\/newsite\/article\/5272#.Uo9pGl9FDGg\u000a      (a summarized version of the 2002 MLR article).\u000a    Why the impact matters. As a consequence of Jackson's research,\u000a      the law has been altered so that infertile people seeking fertility\u000a      treatment are now presumed to be fit to parent and so are no longer\u000a      subjected to an intrusive and discriminatory assessment procedure.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A core claim in Emily Jackson's 2001 book and 2002 article was that the\u000a      process for assessing infertile people's fitness to parent before being\u000a      allowed to have fertility treatment was unduly invasive and\u000a      discriminatory.\u000a    As a result of this research, the process was changed. In the UK,\u000a      infertile patients are now presumed to be fit parents, and withholding of\u000a      fertility treatment on child welfare grounds is only possible if the child\u000a      would be at risk of serious harm. The link between the research and the\u000a      policy change is affirmed by Professor Lisa Jardine, chair of the Human\u000a      Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) between 2008 and 2012.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    London School of Economics and Political Science\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"London School of Economics and Political Science","InstitutionName":"London School of Economics & Political Science","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10004063}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a(2001) E.

Over himself, over his own body and mind, the\u000a        individual is sovereign.\u000a      Its application to reproduction has been espoused by Professor Emily\u000a        Jackson.... She has written that \"interfering with a particular\u000a        individual's decision to conceive a child would usually involve\u000a        violating their bodily integrity and sexual privacy. We do not sterilise\u000a        people who have been convicted of violent offences against children\u000a        because, however gruesome their crime, their person must remain\u000a        inviolate ... the freedom to decide for oneself whether or not to\u000a        reproduce is integral to a person's sense of being the author of their\u000a        own life plan.... This approach emphasises the importance of the\u000a        individual, specifically the autonomy of the individual and the right to\u000a        make private choices.... [D]ecisions which fall into the private domain\u000a        are generally regarded as not of interest to the state. Certain\u000a        exceptions to this maxim do, of course, exist but these generally arise\u000a        in the sphere of criminal law. Thus, when the service to be provided is\u000a        the implantation of an embryo with the intention of establishing a\u000a        pregnancy, and in line with Article 8 of the European Convention on\u000a        Human Rights ... reproduction itself would seem to be firmly situated\u000a        within the private domain. The primary consequence of this is that the\u000a        right to private and family life espoused in Article 8 can be said to\u000a        apply to reproductive decisions.\"   \u000a    Source files: https:\/\/apps.lse.ac.uk\/impact\/download\/file\/1381\u000a    3.

In Regulating Reproduction\u000a      (2001), Jackson developed an account of what reproductive autonomy entails\u000a      and why it matters. In relation to assisted conception, her claim is that\u000a      although there are more opportunities for external scrutiny of decisions\u000a      to reproduce when people need external assistance in order to reproduce as\u000a      compared with when they reproduce naturally, this does not mean that these\u000a      opportunities should be taken. Decisions about whether, when and with whom\u000a      to reproduce are of such critical importance to a person's life plan that\u000a      the state needs a greater justification for interference with them than\u000a      the fact that it can do so relatively easily.\u000a    This argument was developed further in the 2002 Modern Law Review\u000a      article, `Conception and the Irrelevance of the Welfare Principle', in\u000a      which Jackson dismantles the pre-conception welfare principle, embodied in\u000a      section 13(5) of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.\u000a    According to s. 13(5), clinicians must base their decisions to provide\u000a      assisted conception services upon an assessment of the welfare of any\u000a      child who might be born as a consequence. This is problematic because it\u000a      means that the decision as to whether a child should exist should be based\u000a      upon an assessment of whether it is in the child's best interests to\u000a      exist. If interpreted literally, it could be used to deny access to\u000a      infertility treatment only where non-existence would be preferable to the\u000a      life that would be led by these would-be parents' offspring.\u000a    This was not the interpretation that had taken hold, however. In 2001,\u000a      clinicians were instructed by the HFEA's Code of Practice to take into\u000a      account factors such as the would-be parents' commitment to having and\u000a      bringing up a child; their ability to provide a stable and supportive\u000a      environment and their future ability to look after or provide for a\u000a      child's needs.\u000a    This prompted Jackson, in her 2002 article, to criticize s. 13(5) further\u000a      on the basis that it is in practice impossible for a doctor in a fertility\u000a      clinic to carry out the sort of in-depth scrutiny of parental fitness that\u000a      is routine in relation to adoption. Assessments of child welfare were not\u000a      only often intrusive and unfair but also ineffectual since the clinicians\u000a      charged with carrying them out did not have the training or resources to\u000a      scrutinize prospective patients' domestic arrangements. She also\u000a      criticized s. 13(5) for its inconsistency with existing legal principle &#8212;\u000a      in relation to tort actions for `wrongful life', the judiciary has been\u000a      adamant that existence must always be preferred to non-existence &#8212; and\u000a      because the application of the pre-conception welfare principle was\u000a      random: it did not apply to all clinical decisions to offer assistance\u000a      with conception. It would have been unthinkable for parental aptitude to\u000a      be addressed before investigating whether a woman's fallopian tubes are\u000a      blocked, or supplying her with an ovulation-predictor kit. Why, then, was\u000a      it regarded as axiomatic that parental fitness should be assessed before a\u000a      clinician took certain other steps to help a couple to conceive?\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43978","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Sunkin's research has produced the most comprehensive available\u000a      collection of data on Judicial Review. As the primary source of empirical\u000a      research on JR in England and Wales, Sunkin's work has been a significant\u000a      source of information for: civil society groups contributing to policy\u000a      debate on JR policy in England and Wales; court decisions in JR cases; and\u000a      policy-makers in the UK, including the Ministry of Justice (MofJ), the Law\u000a      Commission, and the Scottish Civil Courts Review. Sunkin has also worked\u000a      in partnership with the Public Law Project (PLP) to help their\u000a      campaigning, including co-authoring their responses to a number of MofJ\u000a      consultations on JR reform. The result has been a substantial contribution\u000a      to debate on JR in a number of contexts, informing the recommendations\u000a      made by major policy-makers and in some instances influencing changes made\u000a      in policy and legislation. The impacts of the research come under 3\u000a      categories: impacts on courts, policy, and civil society.\u000a    Impact in courts\u000a    Sunkin's research has had impact on court decisions, both through\u000a      citation of his publications and through recommendations made by Lord\u000a      Justice Jackson, following his review of the costs of civil litigation.\u000a      Lord Justice Jackson's 2009 report on Costs in Civil Litigation\u000a      [corroborating source 1] cites research by Sunkin to support these\u000a      recommendations (para 3.21, p.309 and para 5.2, p.352). Similar arguments\u000a      were accepted in the seminal decision of the Court of Appeal in Bahta\u000a        v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 895. One of the barristers on the case\u000a      comments that `the [research] proved very useful...[it] cast light in an\u000a      important area where there is a serious shortage of information to inform\u000a      policy, even in relation to cost orders' [corroborating source 2].\u000a    Impact on policy\u000a    Sunkin's publications on the impact of JR have informed the work of the\u000a      UK Law Commission, which cited his work in 2010 to support its\u000a      recommendations for improving monetary remedies against public bodies. Of\u000a      Sunkin's work the Law Commission's report comments: `We are glad that such\u000a      work has been undertaken, especially as it backs up our argument that\u000a      there can be positive benefits to litigation' [corroborating source 3].\u000a      His research has also informed policy changes. Sunkin's work on the\u000a      concentration of JR in London and the South East was recognised by the Law\u000a      Commission in 1994 [corroborating source 4, paras 2.20 and 2.28] and by\u000a      the Review of the Crown Office List, Lord Chancellor's Department\u000a      in 2000 [corroborating source 5, Chapter 6 para 21]. Reform ultimately\u000a      occurred in April 2009, when regional JR centres were established in\u000a      Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester and Leeds. A former High Court judge and\u000a      Chairman of the Law Commission writes that `Sunkin's work played a\u000a      significant role in the identification of the problems that flowed from\u000a      lack of easy regional access to judicial review ... and therefore played a\u000a      seminal role in contributing to the reform agenda that eventually led to\u000a      the regionalization of the Administrative Court' [source 6].\u000a    Similarly, Sunkin's research has informed recommendations that were\u000a      incorporated into a Draft Bill for the Scottish Parliament. His research\u000a      was cited to support the recommendations made by Lord Gill's Review of the\u000a      Scottish Civil Courts [source 7, Vol 2, Chapter 12. see esp. paras 34,\u000a      40-50]. The Review states: `... Research [by Sunkin]...suggests that [in\u000a      England &amp; Wales the pre-trial protocol and permission stage] ...work\u000a      well in filtering out unmeritorious applications and in prompting early\u000a      concessions where claims are well founded' (para 50); `We recommend the\u000a      introduction of a requirement to obtain leave to proceed with an\u000a      application for judicial review in Scotland, following the model ...[in]\u000a      ... England and Wales...' (para 51). Following this recommendation, the\u000a      Scottish Government has included a leave requirement in the Draft Courts\u000a      Reform (Scotland) Bill [the process from the Gill review, influenced by\u000a      Sunkin, to the Draft Bill, has been tracked by the UK Constitution Law\u000a      Group blog; see source 8]. Consultation on the Bill is on-going at the\u000a      time of writing (August 2013), with the potential for further impact of\u000a      Sunkin's work in this area if the Bill is passed into law.\u000a    Impact on civil society and the Ministry of Justice\u000a    In England, Sunkin's research has been used by a wide range of\u000a      organisations, including his collaborative partner institution the Public\u000a      Law Project (PLP), to submit responses to MofJ consultations regarding\u000a      reforms to JR and to legal aid. His joint submissions with the Public Law\u000a      Project have been partly responsible for influencing the MofJ's responses\u000a      to those consultations. In 2009, the Legal Services Commission (LSC) and\u000a      the MofJ issued a consultation on their proposal to withdraw solicitors'\u000a      delegated power to self-grant emergency representation in JR cases. Sunkin\u000a      and the PLP used his research to question the statistical data used to\u000a      justify the MofJ's proposal. Sunkin's research was distributed to\u000a      practitioners and expert groups and was widely utilised by them in their\u000a      responses to the consultation (see for example the Advice Service\u000a      Alliance's response to the consultation, corroborating source 9, paras\u000a      3.33-3.34). Ultimately the MofJ decided not to proceed with this reform.\u000a      This decision was partly based on the fact that respondents to the MofJ\u000a      consultation argued that the latter's permission rate statistics were\u000a      unsound [source 10, see especially para 15].\u000a    In December 2012 the MofJ issued another consultation on reforms to JR in\u000a      England and Wales. 22 of the responses to the consultation cited Sunkin's\u000a      research, including responses from The Equality and Human Rights\u000a      Commission, the Advice Workers Alliance, the Bingham Centre for the Rule\u000a      of Law, NGO Reprieve, Garden Court (barristers) the Constitutional and\u000a      Administrative Law Bar Association, and the Education Law Association.\u000a      Sunkin's work on JR was the only research referred to by the Government in\u000a      its response to the consultation.

The research has covered a broad variety of issues\u000a      concerning JR and has developed the most comprehensive available evidence\u000a      base on the use and impact of JR. The three most prominent questions of\u000a      the research have been: who uses JR? how does JR operate? and what is the\u000a      impact of JR?\u000a    Investigating who uses JR, Sunkin has studied the geographical and\u000a      demographic factors associated with the use of judicial review (see 1995\u000a      and 2008). This reveals the concentration of JR litigation in London and\u000a      the South East and the problems faced by populations in other regions in\u000a      accessing JR. Regarding the operation of JR, Sunkin has explored the\u000a      dynamics of public law litigation, including the incidence and reasons for\u000a      out-of-court settlement (see 2008, 2009a, 2009b). The work on the\u000a      operation and effects of the permission stage in JR (by which claimants\u000a      obtain the court's permission to have JRs dealt with in court) has\u000a      highlighted the variation in judicial approaches to permission and the\u000a      variations in refusal and grant rates according to procedure. This work\u000a      has also showed how the permission stage influences early settlement.\u000a    Regarding the impact of JR, Sunkin has undertaken both quantitative and\u000a      qualitative analysis of the effects of JR litigation on claimants, public\u000a      bodies and the quality of public services (e.g. 2010). The research found\u000a      a correlation between increases in legal challenges to local authorities\u000a      and improvement of local authority performance according to general\u000a      performance indicators. The qualitative research has found that legal\u000a      challenges can trigger a reassessment of the way local authorities work,\u000a      and can provide guidance and clarity as to how a local authority can\u000a      improve the quality of its public services.\u000a    Much of Sunkin's research has been undertaken in collaboration with\u000a      colleagues from other disciplines at Essex, other HEIs, and from\u000a      non-academic external organisations. Since 1992 Sunkin has developed a\u000a      partnership with the Public Law Project, a national legal charity, with\u000a      which he has developed a body of research that has been used to inform\u000a      their campaigning and lobbying. Sunkin's research has attracted total\u000a      funding of over &#163;530,000 over 6 grants from the ESRC and the Nuffield\u000a      Foundation.\u000a    As explained below, the research has provided an evidence base for much\u000a      debate and reform of JR in England, Wales, and Scotland. The research on\u000a      the geographical concentration of JR has led to major reforms to regional\u000a      JR access; the research on the permission stage in JR has informed, inter\u000a        alia, Scottish court reform initiatives; and the research on the\u000a      impact of JR has informed the work of the Law Commission in England and\u000a      Wales.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43982","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"1873107","Name":"North Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2589581","Name":"Algeria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The primary impact of Gilbert's research has been to inform and influence\u000a      court judgements\u000a      throughout the world. This has been achieved through the UN High\u000a      Commissioner for Refugees'\u000a      Guidelines on Exclusion, which has provided guidance for a huge number of\u000a      court cases since\u000a      2003. These guidelines were heavily influenced by the research described\u000a      in section two. Gilbert's\u000a      research has also been cited directly in court judgements, and has\u000a      underpinned professional\u000a      training that he has organised for the UN and the European Council.\u000a    The UNHCR 2003 Guidelines on Exclusion\u000a    In February 1998 Gilbert presented a paper at a closed symposium for the\u000a      UK Government's\u000a      Department for International Development (DfID), attended by\u000a      representatives of UNHCR and\u000a      other international agencies. Drawing on the underpinning research,\u000a      Gilbert's presentation\u000a      comprised a digest of the principle of Exclusion in article 1F of the 1951\u000a      Convention Relating to the\u000a      Status of Refugees [corroborating source 1]. His presentation led the DfID\u000a      to invite him to write a\u000a      Global Consultation paper, commissioned to clarify those issues in\u000a      international law that he had\u000a      identified in his research on exclusion. That Global Consultation paper\u000a      draws on Gilbert's\u000a      academic research into the regime interaction between different branches\u000a      of international refugee\u000a      law, and clarifies the range of issues raised by the overlaps between\u000a      Article 1F of the 1951\u000a      Convention, international treaties, and international human rights law.\u000a    Gilbert's Consultation paper was discussed in UNHCR in 2000 and at the\u000a      Lisbon Roundtable in\u000a      2001 in the presence of UNHCR officials, other international\u000a      organisations, government ministers,\u000a      lawyers and academics. Most importantly Gilbert's research, in the form of\u000a      the Global Consultation\u000a      paper, contributed significantly to the UNHCR 2003 Guidelines on Exclusion\u000a      [source 2]: apart from\u000a      two paragraphs (5 and 6), every issue addressed in the Guidelines is\u000a      raised in Gilbert's research.\u000a      The influence of Gilbert's research on the 2003 Guidelines has been\u000a      attested by the then Chief of\u000a      the Protection Policy and Legal Advice Section of the Division of\u000a      International Protection of\u000a      UNHCR (now the Director of International Protection, UNHCR):\u000a    I oversaw the production of the 2001 Global Consultations for the 50th\u000a      Anniversary of the\u000a      1951 Convention, which included Professor Gilbert's paper on\u000a      Exclusion...This paper directly\u000a      influenced UNHCR's 2003 Guidelines on Exclusion and the\u000a      accompanying Background Note\u000a    Director of International Protection, UNHCR\u000a    The Guidelines have been cited innumerable times in courts worldwide and\u000a      form the basis for\u000a      training on the topic for all UNHCR staff.

To this\u000a      end, in January 2013 Gilbert hosted a two day closed-door roundtable\u000a      attended by experts in\u000a      international refugee law including senior UNHCR staff, judges, academics,\u000a      and refugee law\u000a      practitioners. Gilbert co-organised and contributed to discussions in the\u000a      symposium, on which the\u000a      UNHCR will base their revisions.\u000a    Worldwide Training for Legal Professionals\u000a    In addition to his significant contribution to the primary international\u000a      legal document on exclusion\u000a      from refugee status, Gilbert was the founding Director of UNHCR's annual\u000a      Thematic Refugee\u000a      Training Programme at the International Institute for Humanitarian Law,\u000a      Sanremo, Italy. The\u000a      programme included the findings of his research on Exclusion and trained\u000a      judges, lawyers and\u000a      UNHCR staff from all over the world. Gilbert ran the programme from\u000a      2005-07 and was involved in\u000a      the planning and preparation in 2008. As a result of that training, the\u000a      European Council of\u000a      Refugees and Exiles used Gilbert as a trainer on Exclusion for judges and\u000a      lawyers from all over\u000a      Europe at its Athens workshop in February 2008 [see corroborating source\u000a      3].\u000a    In October 2009, Gilbert presented a paper on the topic at the European\u000a      Chapter of the\u000a      International Association of Refugee Law Judges in Berlin; he was one of\u000a      only two academics at\u000a      the conference and the only one to present a paper. He was also invited in\u000a      2012 to address\u000a      refugee law judges and lawyers from Commonwealth states at a workshop\u000a      sponsored by the\u000a      Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Gilbert's contributions to training\u000a      programmes, conferences,\u000a      and workshops have often led to the use of his research in court cases. In\u000a      May 2008, Gilbert was\u000a      invited to speak on Exclusion at the Center for Refugee Studies in Toronto\u000a      at a closed conference\u000a      for academics and judges on `Critical Issues Facing Refugee Law'. The\u000a      judges attending the\u000a      conference were from Canada, Australia and Germany. In one instance\u000a      Gilbert's contribution to the\u000a      conference impacted on a decision made by a judge in attendance. The\u000a      German judge in\u000a      attendance at the conference, Dr Harald D&#246;rig, sits on the German Federal\u000a      Administrative Court\u000a      (GFAC), and cited Gilbert in the Court's referral to the European Court of\u000a      Justice. Specifically,\u000a      Gilbert's research was cited in clarifying that the purpose of exclusion\u000a      clauses are to ensure that\u000a      persons not `deserving' of refugee protection cannot escape criminal\u000a      prosecution for past acts.\u000a      This supported the court's decision that exclusion from refugee status can\u000a      be applied in cases in\u000a      which the relevant party no longer poses a criminal threat [source 4].\u000a    The Impact of Research on Court Decisions\u000a    As a consequence of his chapter on Current Issues in Exclusion (2003), in\u000a      January 2009 Gilbert\u000a      was asked to write an expert opinion for Jackman &amp; Associates,\u000a      Toronto, on behalf of Mr Song\u000a      Dae Ri, a North Korean appealing against a denial of refugee status on\u000a      grounds of complicity in\u000a      crimes against humanity. Partly as a result of that opinion, the Canadian\u000a      Government conceded\u000a      without going to court that he should not have been excluded and granted\u000a      him refugee status.\u000a      Gilbert's research here influenced a significant decision by Canada, as\u000a      attested by one of the\u000a      Barristers working on the case: `This appears to be somewhat\u000a      unprecedented, as my colleagues\u000a      tell me that CIC [Citizenship and Immigration Canada] almost always just\u000a      adopts the exclusion\u000a      finding of the IRB [Immigration and Refugee Board]' [source 5].\u000a    Gilbert's research has also been accepted in several other court\u000a      judgments [source 6]. Within this\u000a      REF period, the most pertinent include: Plaintiff M47\/2012 v Director\u000a        General of Security [2012]\u000a      HCA 46 (5 October 2012); and AH (Algeria) v Secretary of State for the\u000a        Home Department [2012]\u000a      EWCA Civ 395 (2 April 2012).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Geoff Gilbert's research on exclusion in international refugee\u000a      law has influenced policies\u000a      of international organisations and courts around the world.

This\u000a      work has analysed case law, treaties, domestic legislation, and soft law\u000a      to reveal a tension in\u000a      international law between the right to protection against oppressive\u000a      regimes and the need to\u000a      prosecute international criminal law. The work that underpins Gilbert's\u000a      impact focuses particularly\u000a      on Article 1F of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees,\u000a      the primary legal\u000a      document used to define who is a refugee, the rights of refugees, and the\u000a      legal obligations of\u000a      states. The 1951 Convention is unusual for a humanitarian instrument in\u000a      that it allows an individual\u000a      to be excluded from its protection because of that individual's behaviour.\u000a      That exclusion from\u000a      protection, specified in Article 1F, is in many cases crucial for allowing\u000a      the prosecution, under\u000a      international criminal law, of alleged perpetrators. From 1993 to present\u000a      Gilbert has built a\u000a      collection of work that analyses the principle of exclusion from refugee\u000a      status in international law.\u000a    Gilbert's work shows that the overlap between the 1951 Convention and\u000a      international criminal law\u000a      has been fraught with confusion and a lack of clear guidance. Judgements\u000a      as to whether a certain\u000a      individual is to be excluded from refugee status for the purpose of\u000a      international criminal\u000a      prosecution often have to heed an opaque complex of constraints from\u000a      Article 1F, bi- and multi-lateral\u000a      international treaties, and international human rights law. The\u000a      contribution of the\u000a      underpinning research has been to document, analyse, and explain this\u000a      confusion related to\u000a      exclusion from refugee status. Gilbert's publications have covered a range\u000a      of cases and relevant\u000a      international law to survey the extent of this confusion, and to suggest\u000a      ways in which the\u000a      international community can provide clear guidance on how to employ\u000a      Article 1F. Much of the\u000a      underpinning research has also focussed on residuary guarantees where\u000a      Convention refugee\u000a      status does not avail. Gilbert has written about the relationship between\u000a      Articles 1F and 33(2) of\u000a      the Convention, the latter stating that refugee protection ought not to be\u000a      afforded to an individual\u000a      regarded as a danger to the security of the country he or she is in.\u000a    This research has been published as Transnational Fugitive Offenders\u000a        in International Law, in\u000a      which Gilbert analyses &#8212; inter alia &#8212; the relationship between\u000a      Article 1F and the prosecution of\u000a      individuals for war crimes, crimes against peace, crimes against humanity,\u000a      serious non-political\u000a      crimes and acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United\u000a      Nations. This work was later\u000a      published in an updated form in Feller, T&#252;rk and Nicholson, Refugee\u000a        Protection in International\u000a        Law, and translated for use by French readers in 2008. An expanded\u000a      version of Transnational\u000a      Fugitive Offenders was published as Responding to International\u000a        Crime (2006). Since 1998 Gilbert\u000a      has continued to work on the complex array of issues surrounding exclusion\u000a      from refugee status,\u000a      including how it is affected both by a hierarchy of different branches of\u000a      international law and by the\u000a      legal definition of acts of terrorism.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43989","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This research has had an impact on the inspection of prisons, police,\u000a      probation, prosecution and courts. It has influenced the strategic\u000a      thinking of ministers, senior civil servants, and Chief Inspectors, and\u000a      has informed the way these strategies have been transformed into\u000a      inspection policy and practice, for example by developing a risk-based\u000a      approach, encouraging unannounced inspections, inspecting the use of the\u000a      person escort record, encouraging dialogue between inspectorates and\u000a      government departments regarding research activity, and refining\u000a      inspection of corruption in prisons. These changes have been achieved\u000a      through the following mechanisms:\u000a    Non-Executive Director, Management Board\u000a      of HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate: www.hmcpsi.gov.uk\u000a    Professor Shute was appointed as the first non-executive director of this\u000a      Management Board by the then Attorney General (Rt Hon. Baroness\u000a      Patricia Scotland QC) and the then HM Chief Inspector (Stephen Wooler) in\u000a      2008, and remains in the role. Since 2009, the directorship has provided\u000a      one of the key vehicles through which to generate impact derived from the\u000a      research. The Board oversees the running of the Inspectorate,\u000a      which scrutinises the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Serious\u000a      Fraud Office. It sets the strategy and vision for the Inspectorate. It\u000a      also oversees joint inspection activity carried out by the Inspectorate\u000a      with other inspectorates. The ideas developed in the research - such as\u000a      the need for robust methodology, the value of thematic inspection, the\u000a      need for `lay' involvement in inspection, the need for inspection to be\u000a      informed by research, and the value of transparency - have underpinned\u000a      Professor Shute's work on the Board and hence have informed the\u000a      broad strategy the Inspectorate has set for itself. His research has also\u000a      had a strong impact on specific significant policy changes, such as the\u000a      decision in 2009 to move away from rolling programmes of area inspections\u000a      to a more risk-based approach, as well as (also following arguments drawn\u000a      from the research) ensuring that the broader strategy of the inspectorate\u000a      pays proper attention to using inspection resources efficiently to the\u000a      benefit of the public; ensuring that inspection reports are clear,\u000a      authoritative and influential; and ensuring that the inspectorate never\u000a      loses sight of the need for the criminal justice system to work\u000a      holistically. These policy changes were achieved through presentations and\u000a      discussion at Board meetings. Stephen Wooler, the former HM\u000a      Inspector of the CPS, has explained [see Section 5, C1] that Professor\u000a      Shute's contributions, based on his research, were central to the\u000a      introduction of various changes in inspection practice. Michael Fuller,\u000a      the current HM Chief Inspector of the CPS, further notes [C2] that\u000a      Professor Shute's research influenced key aspects of inspection practice,\u000a      including the highly- significant decision `to move away from the long\u000a      established rolling programmes of CPS Area inspections to a more\u000a      risk-based approach'.\u000a    Member, Ministerial Advisory Board on Joint\u000a          Inspection in the Criminal Justice System:\u000a    This Ministerial Advisory Board was in place for four years,\u000a      ending in October 2011. The Board had three independent members,\u000a      including Professor Shute. Its role was to provide ministers with high-\u000a      level advice and guidance on strategic issues concerning inspection across\u000a      the criminal justice system. For a period of four years, it was\u000a      influential in the decisions taken on strategy for joint inspection and\u000a      helped to shape the joint inspection programme itself. The fruits of\u000a      Professor Shute's academic research programme were folded into the advice\u000a      that the Board offered. The ideas presented, both orally at Board\u000a      meetings and via letters and memoranda sent formally to the three criminal\u000a      justice ministers and the five Chief Inspectors, included the importance\u000a      of a proportionate approach, the value of `whole system' inspection, the\u000a      value of unannounced inspection, and the need to inspect neglected parts\u000a      of the criminal justice system (such as pre- court summary justice).\u000a      Stephen Wooler affirms [C1] that the Board's impact came from its\u000a      ability to draw on leading-edge research to identify strategic priorities\u000a      and emphasis. He further affirms that the research carried out by\u000a      Professor Shute was particularly influential in this regard. Similarly,\u000a      Michael Fuller [C2] states that Professor Shute's research, and the ideas\u000a      and principles and approaches to inspection and the practical suggestions\u000a      for change that it generated, `all had a strong influence on the Board's\u000a      discussion, its general approach, and the decisions it then took on the\u000a      shape of the joint inspection programme that it approved'.\u000a    A further argument presented by Professor Shute in the research described\u000a      in this case study is that inspection must be evidence-based and\u000a      evidence-led. Drawing on his research, Professor Shute made that point\u000a      forcefully to ministers at Board meetings. As a `direct result' of\u000a      this argument and its translation into practice, `the Criminal Justice\u000a      Chief Inspectors' Group now has regular meetings with Ministry of Justice\u000a      and other Whitehall officials in order for the officials to keep them\u000a      abreast of government research in the areas they inspect jointly' - an\u000a      approach which has also `helped promote the development of an\u000a      evidenced-based approach to the formulation of criminal justice policy by\u000a      Ministry of Justice officials' [C2].\u000a    Chair, Independent Crime Statistics Advisory\u000a          Committee:\u000a    In 2011 Professor Shute was appointed as the inaugural Chair of this Advisory\u000a        Committee, which was established by the National Statistician (Jil\u000a      Matheson) with the approval of the Home Secretary (Rt Hon. Theresa May).\u000a      The Committee's role is to provide advice to the Home Secretary,\u000a      the National Statistician, and HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. Its Terms\u000a      of Reference explicitly state that it should advise HM Inspectorate of\u000a      Constabulary on its audits of police crime recording and data integrity.\u000a      In accordance with that duty, it has assisted the Inspectorate to develop\u000a      inspections of two key issues: freeing up police time, and crime data\u000a      integrity. The Chair's role is to provide strategic leadership for the Committee,\u000a      including setting its vision and acting as its ambassador with key\u000a      stakeholders within government and across the public arena. The analysis\u000a      and argumentation set out in the research described in this case study\u000a      have provided the touchstone which has informed Professor Shute's work as\u000a      Chair in relation to the Inspectorate. The fruits of his research have\u000a      been folded into the advice offered to the Inspectorate concerning the\u000a      construction of its current programme of inspection of crime data\u000a      integrity, including emphasising the importance of rigour and\u000a      transparency, advising on methodology, and emphasising the need to collect\u000a      time-series data to provide information about changes in quality in this\u000a      important area over time [C3].\u000a    Member, Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in\u000a          Custody:\u000a    The role of the Panel is to help shape government policy in\u000a      relation to deaths in custody, through the provision of high-level advice\u000a      and expertise. It is sponsored by the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office\u000a      and the Department of Health, and its members are appointed by ministers.\u000a      Professor Shute has been a member of the Panel since 2009. He\u000a      leads on information flows across the criminal justice system. As part of\u000a      that work, and building on the ideas drawn from the research, he initiated\u000a      an inspection by HM Inspectorate of Prisons (with HM Inspectorate of\u000a      Constabulary) on the way in which information of risk of harm is\u000a      transferred between criminal justice agencies. This has been published as\u000a      The Use of the Person Escort Record with Detainees at the Risk of Self\u000a        Harm: A Thematic Report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons [C4]. The\u000a      Report recommends changes relating to record-keeping, better\u000a      documentation, better training, better health-care screening, more\u000a      effective quality control, and more effective inter-agency collaboration.\u000a      The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has accepted [C5] all of\u000a      the recommendations in the Report which are its responsibility, and this\u000a      should result in changes which reduce the risk of self-harm for those\u000a      detained in custody.\u000a    High-Level Seminar on the Inspection of Corruption in Prisons:\u000a    Organised by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons (Nick Hardwick), with\u000a      Professor Shute, and held in London in October 2012, this seminar was\u000a      informed by Shute's research, which was `crucial to the way the\u000a      discussions were framed` [C6]. The seminar was attended by senior\u000a      stakeholders in the field and has `informed current thinking on the\u000a      strategy to eliminate corruption in prisons and on inspection of this\u000a      difficult issue' [C6].\u000a    Appointing HM Chief Inspector of the CPS:\u000a    In December 2009, Professor Shute served as the independent member of a\u000a      four-person interview panel, which recommended to the Attorney General a\u000a      preferred candidate for the position of HM Chief Inspector of the CPS.\u000a      Ideas set out in Professor Shute's research, such as the need for risk-\u000a      based inspection, were central to this process.\u000a    In all these areas, the research described in this case study has\u000a      influenced the thinking of ministers, senior policy-makers, and the\u000a      criminal justice inspectorates. It has had a `demonstrable impact' [C2] on\u000a      their work. By helping the inspectorates to improve our criminal justice\u000a      services and by promoting `the development of an evidenced-based approach\u000a      to formulation of criminal justice policy by the Ministry of Justice\u000a      officials' [C2], it has made a difference which touches us all.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes the impact that has arisen from an extended\u000a      research project carried out by Professor Shute, since 2009, on inspection\u000a      of the main criminal justice agencies &#8212; police, prosecution, courts,\u000a      prisons and probation &#8212; in the United Kingdom. The impact of the research\u000a      has been at a number of levels: the development by ministers and senior\u000a      civil servants of high- level strategy concerning criminal justice\u000a      inspection; the translation of that strategy into inspection policy; and\u000a      the conversion of inspection policy into inspection practice.

Does it `work'?\u000a      The second [R2] examines the various attempts made by ministers,\u000a        policy-makers, and the inspectorates since 1996 to introduce a more\u000a        joined-up approach to criminal justice inspection in England and Wales.\u000a        It reflects on why these efforts had only limited success and what\u000a        lessons might be learned.\u000a      The third [R3] takes the long view. It examines the development of\u000a        single agency criminal justice inspection of prisons and the police from\u000a        1835, when a system of inspection of prisons was first established,\u000a        until the present day. By tracking the evolution of these inspectorates\u000a        over time, it exposes shared themes and commonalities of approach, which\u000a        would otherwise be hidden. It pays particular attention to the\u000a        relationships between the inspectorates and ministers and explores the\u000a        ways in which ministers have sought to shape and influence these\u000a        inspectorates' work to serve their own policy objectives.\u000a    \u000a    Phase Two seeks to publish the outcome of further interviews\u000a      conducted with criminal justice ministers, agency heads, and chief\u000a      inspectors within a forthcoming book jointly authored with Professor Rod\u000a      Morgan who was HM Chief Inspector of Probation from 2001 to 2004 (Shute,\u000a      S. and Morgan, R., (forthcoming) Just Inspecting: Building\u000a        Accountability and Legitimacy in Criminal Justice, Oxford University\u000a      Press).\u000a    Phases One and Two of the research are supported by a grant of &#163;10k from\u000a      the British Academy\/Leverhulme Trust.\u000a    Some of the impact described in this case study came about while the\u000a      underpinning research was being carried out and took effect alongside its\u000a      production; other aspects happened after the articles had been completed,\u000a      but before they finally appeared in print.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44007","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact detailed below has been achieved as a consequence of the\u000a      relevant regulators being involved throughout the research process. The\u000a      policy-oriented research was commissioned by the agencies. Baldwin and\u000a      Black secured the commission &#8212; the outcome of a competitive bid &#8212; because\u000a      SNIFFER (the research forum for the agencies) recognized that their prior\u000a      research (2008, 2010b) had been favourably received by many regulators and\u000a      regulatory bodies.\u000a    The main objective of the commissioned research was to develop a strategy\u000a      for regulating low risk sites. The data which Baldwin and Black (2012)\u000a      uncovers provide an essential basis for understanding how and why\u000a      risk-based regulation developed, how it was implemented, some of the key\u000a      challenges of implementation, how these challenges could be addressed, and\u000a      the significance of the institutional and political context for the\u000a      development and operation of risk-based regulatory strategies in low risk\u000a      contexts.\u000a    The Irish EPA has used the GRID\/GRAF strategy to demonstrate legal\u000a      compliance with its European regulatory obligations. Black and Baldwin\u000a      have collaborated with the EPA in implementing that approach (and in\u000a      providing an account of this process: 2013b pp.3-14; see also section 5,\u000a      source 5). The Irish government had been found by the European Court of\u000a      Justice to be in breach of its obligations under EU law for the inspection\u000a      of septic tanks. In response, the EPA developed a National Inspection Plan\u000a      for septic tanks based on the Black\/Baldwin approach (an account of the\u000a      response is set out in 2013b pp.16-20). This has been approved by the EU\u000a      Commission and was implemented in 2012.\u000a    Evidence of the impact of the Baldwin\/Black approach can be found in\u000a      chapter 4 of the Irish EPA's Inspection Plan for Domestic Waste Water\u000a        Systems (section 5, source 6), where the Plan is explained.\u000a      Following the Baldwin and Black framework, the EPA makes it clear in\u000a      chapter 4 that determinations as to whether owners of domestic waste water\u000a      treatment sites are complying with their statutory obligations should be\u000a      based on regulatory standards which accord with \"the principles of Better\u000a      Regulation\", which means (among other things) \"focus[ing] on risk-based\u000a      inspections\" of treatment systems while also lowering the costs of\u000a      carrying out risk assessments by introducing a site registration system\u000a      which puts the burden on site owners to disclose, rather than on site\u000a      inspectors to discover, risks of contamination (p.12). The details of the\u000a      plan, elaborated at pp.13-28, are in line with GRID\/GRAF specifications.\u000a      According to Laura Burke, Director General of the Irish EPA:\u000a    \"[T]he research work [on GRID\/GRAF] undertaken Professor Julia Black and\u000a      Professor Robert Baldwin addressed a key challenge in the regulation of\u000a      wastewater from single houses and was timely in that it influenced policy\u000a      not only alone here in Ireland but also in the European Commission's\u000a      Environment Directorate. The solution required an understanding of the\u000a      challenge from an environmental perspective but also the motivation behind\u000a      how people act on this environmental issue. Another unique and important\u000a      feature of Professor Black and Baldwin's work was the interface between\u000a      independent research and framing a solution for the regulator.... Overall,\u000a      the output of the research work and the interface between research and\u000a      policy is an excellent example of the value that can be gained from\u000a      expenditure on environmental research.\" (Section 5, source 10.)\u000a    The reach of the research impact is considerable. The UK Environment\u000a      Agency (UKEA) and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA)\u000a      utilized the Baldwin\/Black framework when reviewing their approaches to\u000a      regulating small sewage discharges (including septic tanks) in the waste\u000a      and industrial sectors: see the testimonials from Nic Parr and Cath\u000a      Preston (section 5, sources 7 and 8). The UKEA has used the framework as a\u000a      strategic planning tool for areas other than low risk sites, and is keen\u000a      to rely on it as a basis for policy discussions with Government. SEPA is\u000a      using the GRID\/GRAF model as the foundation for its \"better regulation\"\u000a      approach to pollution prevention and control at three types of low risk\u000a      site (water treatment facilities, petrol stations and dry cleaners):\u000a      section 5, source 9. Furthermore, the EU network for the implementation\u000a      and enforcement of environmental law (IMPEL) has expressed an interest in\u000a      the research, as have environmental regulators in Australia.\u000a    Why the impact matters. As a result of Black &amp; Baldwin's\u000a      research having had the impact demonstrated in this study, monitoring\u000a      protocols for low risk sites are being improved (so that the likelihood of\u000a      poor water treatment and similar facilities being unsatisfactorily\u000a      regulated is significantly lowered), and the Irish EPA, which was\u000a      previously in breach of its European regulatory obligations, can now\u000a      demonstrate compliance with the relevant provisions of the EU\u000a      Environmental Directives.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The four Environment Agencies in England &amp; Wales, Northern Ireland,\u000a      Scotland and the Republic of Ireland have introduced, or are planning to\u000a      introduce, new strategies for regulating low risk treatment sites and\u000a      activities.

Black is also a\u000a      member of the LSE's ESRC Centre for the Analysis of Risk and Regulation\u000a      (CARR).\u000a    The research develops an innovative strategy for dealing with low risk\u000a      sites and activities and offers a framework for deciding how best to\u000a      intervene in order to regulate lower risks effectively and at lowest cost.\u000a      The methodology &#8212; extensively elaborated in 2008, 2010a, 2010b, 2012,\u000a      2013a and 2013b &#8212; relies on both field and secondary research into\u000a      compliance and enforcement mechanisms and risk-based regulation.\u000a    At the core of the research is a matrix, the Good Regulatory Intervention\u000a      Design (GRID), which enables regulators to categorize activities according\u000a      to breakdowns of two factors: the nature of the risk and the nature of the\u000a      regulated entity. Using GRID, regulators can select which intervention\u000a      tools to use &#8212; whether, for instance, to use inspections, information\u000a      campaigns or other control techniques. GRID also provides guidance on the\u000a      overall level of regulatory intensity that should apply (i.e., the level\u000a      of resources to be brought to bear and the severity of sanctions to be\u000a      deployed).\u000a    GRID is complemented by a Good Regulatory Assessment Framework (GRAF).\u000a      The GRAF is a survey regime which enables agencies to review their\u000a      performance when devising low risk strategies. Combined, GRID\/GRAF provide\u000a      regulatory agencies with a new approach to identifying and managing their\u000a      regulatory priorities and resources in the face of expanding\u000a      responsibilities and shrinking budgets. A detailed account of the Irish\u000a      Environmental Protection Agency's implementation of GRID\/GRAF in a\u000a      specific area is set out in 2013b.\u000a    The underpinning research consists of (i) qualitative empirical research\u000a      into risk based regulation in several countries and sectors (2005-2011);\u000a      (ii) qualitative empirical research (carried out over a number of projects\u000a      from 1995-2011) into compliance and enforcement practices by regulatory\u000a      agencies; and (iii) development of a positive and normative framework\u000a      (principally devised over 2006-2008) for compliance and enforcement\u000a      action.\u000a    There were four stages to the research. The first was a desk-based review\u000a      of regulators' approaches in five sectors and seven countries (including a\u000a      web-based survey of field officers' practices and semi-structured\u000a      interviews with agency officials). Stage two involved the development of\u000a      the framework with reference to five specific areas of low risk, and\u000a      revision of regulatory criteria in collaboration with inspectors,\u000a      regulatory managers, regulated bodies, relevant NGOs and government\u000a      departments. The third phase consisted of further `verification' meetings\u000a      with senior policy officials within the agencies (a total of 38 officials\u000a      across the four agencies). The final stage was the testing of the\u000a      regulatory framework in workshops with the English Environment Agency and\u000a      Scottish Environment Protection Agency (this took place in October 2011).\u000a      The research phases are detailed in a series of policy documents (section\u000a      5, sources 2, 3 and 4).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44012","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Istanbul convention\u000d\u000a    Chinkin's research has had significant impact by virtue of its having led\u000d\u000a      to the recognition of gender-based violence against women as a violation\u000d\u000a      of international human rights law.

Parties shall take the necessary legislative and other\u000d\u000a      measures to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, punish and\u000d\u000a      provide reparation for acts of violence covered by the scope of this\u000d\u000a      Convention that are perpetrated by non-state actors') has its basis in her\u000d\u000a      long-standing argument for due diligence as a mechanism for promoting\u000d\u000a      greater state accountability with a view to eliminating violence against\u000d\u000a      women (see, e.g., Chinkin 2001, p. 57: `Failure by the state to exercise\u000d\u000a      due diligence to prevent and punish violence against women constitutes a\u000d\u000a      violation of human rights for which it is responsible. Implementation of\u000d\u000a      national laws that address gender-based violence is one very clear and\u000d\u000a      pivotal way in which women's subordination can be addressed'). In March\u000d\u000a      2012 the Prime Minister announced that the UK would sign the Convention,\u000d\u000a      which he described as `unprecedented' and `vital' as it would `lift the\u000d\u000a      standards of protection for women across Europe'.\u000d\u000a    The impact of Chinkin's research on the drafting of the Istanbul\u000d\u000a      convention is discussed in the testimonial of Liri Kopa&#231;i-Di Michale\u000d\u000a      (section 5, source 2), a Head of Division at the Secretariat General of\u000d\u000a      the Council of Europe.\u000d\u000a    Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict\u000d\u000a    In 2009, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)\u000d\u000a      introduced a programme on access to justice for women, post-conflict. The\u000d\u000a      accompanying Report on The Protection of Economic, Social and Cultural\u000d\u000a      Rights Post-Conflict (2009), written by Chinkin and drawing on her\u000d\u000a      research on sexual violence in armed conflict, was presented at an expert\u000d\u000a      meeting of the OHCHR in Geneva and became a key component of the\u000d\u000a      programme. The research has also been used by the OHCHR for interventions\u000d\u000a      at the International Criminal Court: this is discussed in the testimonial\u000d\u000a      of Madeleine Rees (section 5, source 3), a former representative of the\u000d\u000a      OHCHR. Chinkin has also drawn on this research in assisting the FCO with\u000d\u000a      the UK's initiative on Tackling Sexual Violence as a Tactic of War and\u000d\u000a      Conflict. Following the announcement of this initiative by the Foreign\u000d\u000a      Secretary, William Hague, in June 2012, Chinkin was invited to the FCO to\u000d\u000a      discuss the approach that should be taken (section 5, source 8). Chinkin\u000d\u000a      further contributed to the UK's strategy as one of the speakers at the\u000d\u000a      conference organised by the FCO on this subject in November 2012 (section\u000d\u000a      5, source 7). At the G8 meeting in April 2013, the UK used its presidency\u000d\u000a      to agree a declaration on preventing sexual violence in conflict.\u000d\u000a    Improving access to justice for women in Argentina\u000d\u000a    In 2012 Christine Chinkin was invited by the Public Defender's Office,\u000d\u000a      Argentina to present her research and to work with judges, defenders and\u000d\u000a      prosecutors of the federal and provincial justice systems on programmes\u000d\u000a      that would contribute to developing legal means and strategies for\u000d\u000a      enhancing women's access to justice. The impact is evidenced by the\u000d\u000a      testimonials of the projects officer of the British Embassy in Buenos\u000d\u000a      Aires and the Ministerio Publico de la Defensa in Argentina (section 5,\u000d\u000a      sources 4 and 5).\u000d\u000a    Combating trafficking\u000d\u000a    Chinkin's research was a major influence on the development of the UN Recommended\u000d\u000a        principles and guidelines on human rights and human trafficking\u000d\u000a      (section 5, source 1). These guidelines have been adopted by the UN\u000d\u000a      General Assembly and are used by all UN agencies and most states that have\u000d\u000a      subsequently adopted national plans of action on combating trafficking.\u000d\u000a      The impact of Chinkin's research on the guidelines is evidenced by the\u000d\u000a      acknowledgement in the introduction to the guidelines, and by the\u000d\u000a      testimonial of Madeleine Rees (section 5, source 3), former representative\u000d\u000a      of the OHCHR and now Secretary General of the Women's International League\u000d\u000a      for Peace and Freedom: \"The OHCHR developed the Recommended Principles and\u000d\u000a      Guidelines on Trafficking in Human Beings, which is seen as the core human\u000d\u000a      rights guide on approaches to anti trafficking. Professor Chinkin was a\u000d\u000a      contributor and her research was a major influence on the wording and\u000d\u000a      concepts of the Guidelines. Adopted by the UN General Assembly, the\u000d\u000a      Guidelines are used by all UN agencies and by most states which have\u000d\u000a      subsequently drafted national plans of action on combating human\u000d\u000a      trafficking. The OHCHR convened a major conference on how to prosecute the\u000d\u000a      users of women in the context of trafficking. Professor Chinkin drafted a\u000d\u000a      concept paper [section 5, source 6] on how this could be done applying the\u000d\u000a      jurisprudence from the international ad hoc criminal tribunals and the\u000d\u000a      European Court of Human Rights....

Chinkin's work highlights the traditional\u000d\u000a      omission of women from the public sphere of international relations and\u000d\u000a      shows how the residual space protected from international intervention by\u000d\u000a      state sovereignty has excluded the worldwide subordination of women from\u000d\u000a      international scrutiny (see, in particular, Chinkin 2000, 2002 and 2005).\u000d\u000a      Far from challenging the global oppression of women, international law has\u000d\u000a      legitimated their unequal position worldwide.\u000d\u000a    The objective of the research has been to encourage policy makers to\u000d\u000a      rethink and restructure the discipline of international law so that it\u000d\u000a      might respond to structural bias and revise notions of what subjects are\u000d\u000a      appropriate for international legal regulation and of state\u000d\u000a      responsibility. The research has an obvious theoretical dimension, but it\u000d\u000a      is also &#8212; since it aims to alter the construction and content of\u000d\u000a      international legal principles and their application by international\u000d\u000a      institutions &#8212; a practical engagement directed towards law reform (Chinkin\u000d\u000a      2001).\u000d\u000a    While the research has addressed multiple issues within the international\u000d\u000a      legal system, it has had particular application and impact in\u000d\u000a      international human rights and criminal law (Chinkin 2002). It\u000d\u000a      demonstrates how initiatives to protect women's rights have been largely\u000d\u000a      concerned with the limited concept of equal treatment and\u000d\u000a      non-discrimination on the basis of sex: i.e., with a model of equality\u000d\u000a      that works most effectively for women where they participate in the public\u000d\u000a      sphere, but which fails to redress or even identify the structural\u000d\u000a      inequalities that prevent women actually accessing the public sphere (see\u000d\u000a      Chinkin 2012a).

After the consultation process\u000d\u000a      had ended, he was, in May\u000d\u000a      2009, subsequently part of a group that met the Scottish Government\u000d\u000a      Minister for the Economy to\u000d\u000a      discuss the Bill, and gave oral evidence to the Economy, Energy and\u000d\u000a      Tourism Committee of the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Parliament as part of the formal law-making process by the\u000d\u000a      Parliament (Reference 5.3\u000d\u000a      below). Professor Davidson's advice to the Scottish Government Bill team\u000d\u000a      and the Minister, and his\u000d\u000a      evidence to the Scottish Parliament was distinctly and materially based on\u000d\u000a      the arguments\u000d\u000a      articulated by him in the underpinning research.\u000d\u000a    As explained above, one of the key decisions for the Scottish Government\u000d\u000a      and Parliament was\u000d\u000a      whether to base the Act around the UNCITRAL Model Law on International\u000d\u000a      Commercial Arbitration\u000d\u000a      or to start with a clean slate. In developing its thinking on its adoption\u000d\u000a      of the latter approach, the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government cited Professor Davidson's views. Although the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government\u000d\u000a      introduced him in its report as the author of the SULI textbook on\u000d\u000a      arbitration, it is important for\u000d\u000a      impact measurement purposes to be aware that Professor Davidson's\u000d\u000a      substantive argument on the\u000d\u000a      key point at issue &#8212; which was then expanded upon by the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government &#8212; was first\u000d\u000a      developed by him in his underpinning research. Indeed, this is very\u000d\u000a      clearly evidenced by the fact\u000d\u000a      that the quotation of Professor Davidson in the Scottish Government report\u000d\u000a      set out below is taken\u000d\u000a      directly from p.46 of the underpinning research:\u000d\u000a    \"Professor Fraser Davidson of Stirling University who is the author of\u000d\u000a      the Scottish University Law\u000d\u000a      Institute textbook on arbitration said that the Model Law \"does not\u000d\u000a      provide a comprehensive\u000d\u000a      arbitration regime. It is thus much better to look to the example of\u000d\u000a      states such as England which\u000d\u000a      used the Model Law as the basis for the creation of a comprehensive,\u000d\u000a      modern arbitration statute.\u000d\u000a      Little will be lost by Scotland ceasing to be known as a country which has\u000d\u000a      adopted the Model Law.\u000d\u000a      Its adoption has not seen significant numbers of international\u000d\u000a      arbitrations attracted to Scotland.\" He\u000d\u000a      concluded: \"If Scotland is going to attract international\u000d\u000a      arbitrations....being able to boast an\u000d\u000a      effective, comprehensive, modern arbitration statute is going to be more\u000d\u000a      of an incentive than being\u000d\u000a      one of a large number of states across the globe which has adopted the\u000d\u000a      Model Law.\" (Reference\u000d\u000a      5.4 below).\u000d\u000a    Professor Davidson's views, as articulated in the underpinning research,\u000d\u000a      were also cited very\u000d\u000a      prominently and with approval by the Minister when closing the debate on\u000d\u000a      the Bill before the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Parliament on 18 November 2009 (Reference 5.5 below). The\u000d\u000a      Minister said:\u000d\u000a    \"Scots law has tended to feature mainly as an example of how not to do\u000d\u000a      things, but Professor\u000d\u000a      Fraser Davidson has suggested that, with the advent of the bill, the focus\u000d\u000a      has switched to Scotland\u000d\u000a      as a beacon for the future .... Let us hope that Professor Davidson's\u000d\u000a      words are prophetic and the\u000d\u000a      use of arbitration at home increases markedly as a result of the reforms\u000d\u000a      and modernisation that the\u000d\u000a      bill has introduced. We hope that, as a result, more international\u000d\u000a      arbitration work will be attracted to\u000d\u000a      Scotland and we will see a renaissance of Scottish arbitration.

The research has shaped the\u000d\u000a      substance of anti-terrorism law and been of especial benefit to those\u000d\u000a      citizens whose fair treatment within the criminal justice system has\u000d\u000a      depended upon parliament enacting counter-terrorism legislation which\u000d\u000a      takes proper account of human rights norms.\u000d\u000a    The research which Gearty has produced in connection with the Human\u000d\u000a      Rights and Terrorism project (beginning with 2007a) is premised on the\u000d\u000a      proposition that counter-terrorist activities &#8212; e.g. interrogation and\u000d\u000a      detention procedures and the gathering of intercept evidence &#8212; should, no\u000d\u000a      less than alleged terrorist activities, be governed by the rules of\u000d\u000a      criminal procedure.

The recommendations for legal\u000d\u000a      reform which emerged from the seminars are reflected in those parts of the\u000d\u000a      Act which make the criminal process central to counter-terrorist\u000d\u000a      strategies &#8212; in particular at ss 22 (post-charge questioning), 25\u000d\u000a      (recording of interviews), 26 (issue and revision of code of practice),\u000d\u000a      Part 3 (`Prosecution and Punishment of Terrorist Offences'), and ss 76, 77\u000d\u000a      (new terrorist offences triable under ordinary law).

From 2002 until 2009 Gearty was Director of LSE's\u000d\u000a      Centre for the Study of Human Rights as well as professor of human rights\u000d\u000a      law in the LSE's Law Department (he continues to serve in the latter\u000d\u000a      post).\u000d\u000a    The main research insight which Gearty's scholarship has brought to\u000d\u000a      public attention, and which underpinned the Human Rights and Terrorism\u000d\u000a      project, is the necessity of integrating counter-terrorism law with the\u000d\u000a      traditional criminal law model. One of Gearty's core claims is that this\u000d\u000a      model &#8212; because it demands that those accused of terrorism be subject to\u000d\u000a      principles of natural justice (e.g., being made aware of, and allowed to\u000d\u000a      respond to, all charges made against them) and to a burden of proof beyond\u000d\u000a      reasonable doubt &#8212; ensures that defendants in terrorism cases are treated\u000d\u000a      as subjects with basic human rights and are not presumed to be enemies of\u000d\u000a      the state. This core claim underpins Gearty's critique of those who argue\u000d\u000a      for an emergency-based approach to terrorism (Gearty 2008a), and has led\u000d\u000a      him to reject the argument that aggressive anti-terrorist actions by\u000d\u000a      Western powers are a \"lesser evil\" that should be tolerated. His views are\u000d\u000a      clearly expressed in his commissioned article for Government and\u000d\u000a        Opposition's special issue on terrorism (Gearty 2007a). A more\u000d\u000a      policy-oriented formulation of the argument can be found in Gearty 2007b,\u000d\u000a      there is a chapter explaining the theoretical underpinnings of the\u000d\u000a      position in Gearty 2007c, and the argument features in Gearty's 2013\u000d\u000a      evidence to the Joint Committee on Draft Detention of Terrorist Suspects\u000d\u000a      (section 5 source 3).\u000d\u000a    The ESRC-funded Human Rights and Terrorism project has co-opted lawyers,\u000d\u000a      prosecutors, politicians, civil servants, members of the security forces,\u000d\u000a      and experts in foreign affairs in its effort to formulate an appropriate\u000d\u000a      balance between respect for human rights and the interests of national\u000d\u000a      security. The project was led by Gearty and ran from 2005 to 2008. It took\u000d\u000a      the form of six closed seminars for decision-makers (Gearty produced a\u000d\u000a      discussion paper for each seminar), followed by a similarly restricted\u000d\u000a      conference at which Gearty debated with Professor Sir Lawrence Friedman on\u000d\u000a      the issues arising from the seminars. The seminars and the debate are\u000d\u000a      summarized in a report (Gearty,2008b), along with an adapted pr&#233;cis\u000d\u000a      (Gearty 2007d) in Prospect magazine.\u000d\u000a    A central objective of the Human Rights and Terrorism project was to\u000d\u000a      develop fresh ways of approaching and drafting terrorism legislation\u000d\u000a      (section 5, source 6). As is explained in section 4, Gearty's research\u000d\u000a      emanating from the project impacted specifically on the content of the\u000d\u000a      Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 (and is likely to have post-REF 2014 impact on\u000d\u000a      the drafting of other procedural rules relating to counter-terrorism).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44056","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    On the strength of his previous research on the subject, Collins was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by Consumer Focus to write a research paper on how a private\u000d\u000a      right of redress might be enacted and what the benefits of such\u000d\u000a      legislation might be (both as regards adequate redress and the reform of\u000d\u000a      the confused and outdated common law regarding misrepresentation, duress\u000d\u000a      and undue influence). Consumer Focus relied heavily on the legal analysis\u000d\u000a      in Collins's 2009 research paper in their own report, Waiting to be\u000d\u000a        Heard: Giving Consumers the right of redress over Unfair Commercial\u000d\u000a        Practices (section 5, sources 1 and 4).\u000d\u000a    That report was jointly used by the Law Commission of England and the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Law Commission in drawing up their consultation paper, Consumer\u000d\u000a        Redress for Misrepresentation and Aggressive Practices (section 5,\u000d\u000a      source 2). The section of the consultation paper entitled `Calls for a\u000d\u000a      Private Right of Redress' (paragraphs 1.19 et seq.) begins with a\u000d\u000a      discussion of Collins 2009. The consultation paper also includes several\u000d\u000a      references &#8212; in particular at pp. 24, 26, 84 and 149 - to Collins's other\u000d\u000a      works in this area (cited in section 3, above).\u000d\u000a    Collins organised and was one of the speakers at the only public event\u000d\u000a      concerning the Consultation Paper. This event was attended by civil\u000d\u000a      servants from the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills and by\u000d\u000a      officials involved in the day-to-day enforcement of consumer protection\u000d\u000a      rules, as well as by the teams from both Law Commissions (section 5,\u000d\u000a      sources 6 and 7). This provided further opportunity for his research to\u000d\u000a      influence the final Law Commission proposals. Jessica Uguccioni, a lawyer\u000d\u000a      at the Law Commission, commented that \"written response to [the] proposals\u000d\u000a      can be relatively narrow in what it says, so the LSE event meant we were\u000d\u000a      able to get a much better feel of the reaction.\" (Section 5 source 5.)\u000d\u000a    The Law Commissions published their final report in 2012: Consumer\u000d\u000a        Redress for Misleading and Aggressive Practices (section 5, source\u000d\u000a      3). The final report proposes `targeted' or narrow reform - in the form of\u000d\u000a      a Consumer Bill of Rights &#8212; without addressing the more systematic\u000d\u000a      weaknesses of the common law. The report contains frequent references\u000d\u000a      (most notably at pp. 33, 48 and 81) both to Collins 2009 and to his other\u000d\u000a      cited research.\u000d\u000a    Parliament altered the law so as to put in place the substance of the Law\u000d\u000a      Commissions' Bill of Rights proposal by enacting the Consumer Protection\u000d\u000a      from Unfair Trading (Amendment) Regulations 2013. Direct connections can\u000d\u000a      be drawn between the Collins's 2009 research paper and the 2013\u000d\u000a      Regulations. For example, at p. 26 of his 2009 paper, Collins states:\u000d\u000a    \"The Consumer Bill of Rights should aim to give consumers a consistent\u000d\u000a      direct right of redress across the consumer protection landscape. In the\u000d\u000a      context of this report, it should ensure that consumers enjoy an extension\u000d\u000a      of existing rights of redress in particular areas of unfair commercial\u000d\u000a      practices, where at present no private law remedy is available or no\u000d\u000a      remedy in damages is available. A reform of this nature would involve\u000d\u000a      statutory changes to the private law doctrines of duress and undue\u000d\u000a      influence, and misrepresentation. It might also require adjustments to\u000d\u000a      other aspects of the law of tort.\"\u000d\u000a    And section 27J of the 2013 Regulations provides that:\u000d\u000a    \"a consumer has the right to damages if ... the consumer has incurred\u000d\u000a      financial loss ... or\" &#8212; the extension of the existing rights &#8212; if\u000d\u000a      \"the consumer has suffered alarm, distress, physical discomfort or\u000d\u000a      inconvenience which the consumer would not have [incurred or] suffered if\u000d\u000a      the prohibited practice in question had not taken place.\"\u000d\u000a    Details of the new regulations, acknowledging and providing a link to\u000d\u000a      Collins's 2009 report, are provided in the Government's press release at\u000d\u000a\u0009  https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/news\/new-powers-\u000d\u000a        to-protect-vulnerable-and-elderly-consumers-against-rogue-traders.\u000d\u000a    Why the impact matters. The consequences of Collins's research\u000d\u000a      having had the impact demonstrated in this study are a) that the relevant\u000d\u000a      consumer law principles and attendant legislative provisions have been\u000d\u000a      rendered more coherent and robust, and b) that consumers will now be able\u000d\u000a      to seek redress for unconscionable sales practices, enhancing consumer\u000d\u000a      rights and potentially reducing such practices and associated costs to\u000d\u000a      consumers over time.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Scams and underhand sales practices are estimated to cost consumers in\u000d\u000a      the UK over &#163;3 billion each year.

All of\u000d\u000a      the research underpinning this case study was produced while he was a\u000d\u000a      member of the Law Department (and all of it was produced since 1993). The\u000d\u000a      research project concerns the best ways to use the law to prevent scams\u000d\u000a      and underhand sales practices, which are estimated to cost consumers in\u000d\u000a      the UK approximately &#163;3.3 billion annually. Since these unfair commercial\u000d\u000a      practices operate across borders, the research focuses on European\u000d\u000a      measures and their implementation in the UK. The European Directive on\u000d\u000a      Unfair Commercial Practices expressly avoids any connection with contract\u000d\u000a      law and the possibility of a remedy of private redress for consumers\u000d\u000a      against losses caused by unfair commercial practices.\u000d\u000a    The research identifies the lack of adequate mechanisms for private\u000d\u000a      claims for redress brought by individual consumers who have suffered loss\u000d\u000a      as a result of unfair commercial practices. The most detailed of the\u000d\u000a      papers dealing with this matter is Collins 2009, which shows that although\u000d\u000a      the reformed UK consumer law has criminalised a wide range of unfair\u000d\u000a      commercial practices, the victims of these practices do not always have a\u000d\u000a      right to compensation against rogue traders. The common law governing this\u000d\u000a      issue was developed in the nineteenth century in the context of commercial\u000d\u000a      transactions. Collins' research has identified gaps in the laws governing\u000d\u000a      misrepresentation, duress and undue influence, through which consumers who\u000d\u000a      have been the victims of various scams can fall, leaving them with no\u000d\u000a      possibility of obtaining compensatory damages for their losses, and in\u000d\u000a      some instances unable to recover money paid. For instance, there is rarely\u000d\u000a      liability in private law for misleading though literally true statements\u000d\u000a      and misleading omissions to provide material information to consumers,\u000d\u000a      even though such misleading statements and omissions can be criminal\u000d\u000a      offences. Similarly, pressurised sales techniques may be effective even\u000d\u000a      though they fall short of the requirements for duress and undue influence;\u000d\u000a      so though they are criminal offences, these techniques may create binding\u000d\u000a      contracts, leaving the consumer with no redress.\u000d\u000a    The research shows that a private right of redress would 1) stimulate\u000d\u000a      compliance with the law on unfair commercial practices, 2) serve the goal\u000d\u000a      of restorative justice, and 3) provide the opportunity for a long-overdue\u000d\u000a      overhaul of the existing private law rules in the field. The research\u000d\u000a      proposes various ways by which to overhaul these rules so as to provide an\u000d\u000a      effective remedy for individual consumers for losses suffered as a result\u000d\u000a      of all criminal offences.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44099","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context to impact\u000a      In 2011, as a result of a sustained increase in violence and public\u000a      disorder at Glasgow Rangers\u000a      and Glasgow Celtic football matches, which was closely related to\u000a      deep-rooted sectarian (i.e.\u000a      Protestant \/ Roman Catholic) tensions in West Central Scotland, the First\u000a      Minister of Scotland,\u000a      Alex Salmond, chaired a \"Football Summit\", which was attended by Scottish\u000a      Government\u000a      Ministers, the Police, football clubs and football authorities. These\u000a      sectarian tensions also reflected\u000a      long-standing racism directed against Irish immigrant communities in\u000a      Scotland, and historic cultural\u000a      associations between Glasgow Rangers fans and extremist Ulster Unionism\u000a      and Glasgow Celtic\u000a      fans and militant Irish Republicanism. Following the summit, sectarian and\u000a      offensive behaviour by\u000a      football fans and related threatening communications were identified as\u000a      priorities and the Scottish\u000a      Government introduced highly controversial legislation in the Scottish\u000a      Parliament, which was\u000a      passed as the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening\u000a      Communications (Scotland) Act\u000a      2012.\u000a    The expertise of Drs Goodall and McArdle, as articulated and demonstrated\u000a      in the underpinning\u000a      research, had a distinct and material impact beyond academia by informing\u000a      and enriching the\u000a      Scottish policy debate on hate crime and on the development of legislation\u000a      by the Scottish\u000a      Parliament and Scottish Government in the following ways.\u000a    Impact on policy beyond academia\u000a    Dr Goodall's body of work has showcased her expertise on the interaction\u000a      between hate crime and\u000a      legislation. She was awarded funding in 2011 by the Royal Society of\u000a      Edinburgh and the Clark\u000a      Foundation to organise a colloquium, seminar and workshop on\u000a      \"Conceptualising the 'racial' in\u000a      Scots Criminal Law\". The events took place in October 2011 and April 2012.\u000a      Non-academic\u000a      participants included the Scottish Government, the Crown Office and\u000a      Procurator Fiscal Service (i.e.\u000a      the Scottish public prosecutor's office), the English judiciary, the\u000a      Equality and Human Rights\u000a      Commission, the Scottish Police, local government and Women's Aid\u000a      Edinburgh. This research-based\u000a      leadership had impact by enriching public policy debate beyond academia on\u000a      legal aspects\u000a      of race crime and sectarianism (which are often inter-related in Scotland)\u000a      by facilitating the\u000a      participation of and communication between these key non-academic\u000a      stakeholders, and by\u000a      disseminating a range of views for them. Dr McArdle was part of a\u000a      multi-disciplinary team of\u000a      experts awarded &#163;40,000 by the Scottish Government to inquire into the use\u000a      of Football Banning\u000a      Orders in Scotland, specifically their perceived under-use as a sanction\u000a      for those convicted of\u000a      sectarian-motivated offences associated with football matches. The\u000a      research was completed in\u000a      April 2011 and was published by the Scottish Government in report form in\u000a      July 2011. By co-authoring\u000a      a report published by the Scottish Government, Dr McArdle impacted on\u000a      Scottish public\u000a      policy development beyond academia by enriching and informing debate\u000a      between key\u000a      stakeholders, including the Scottish Government itself. Then, as a result\u000a      of his co-authorship of the\u000a      report and therefore his demonstrated expertise in the area, the Scottish\u000a      Government asked Dr\u000a      McArdle and Niall Hamilton Smith (also of Stirling University) if, in\u000a      conjunction with the Scottish\u000a      Government Community Safety Unit, they would organise a one-day workshop\u000a      for thirty invited key\u000a      participants including senior Scottish Government officials, the Scottish\u000a      Police and other non-academic\u000a      stakeholders to facilitate discussion of the contents of the highly\u000a      controversial Offensive\u000a      Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill 2011.\u000a      The event was held\u000a      in November 2011. Dr McArdle's research-based leadership in\u000a      co-organising the workshop in\u000a      conjunction with the Scottish Government impacted on public policy\u000a      development beyond\u000a      academia by facilitating the participation of and communication between\u000a      these non-academic\u000a      stakeholders in the debate on policy development, and by disseminating a\u000a      range of views for them.\u000a    Dr Goodall and Dr Mcardle are also co-investigators on a\u000a      multi-disciplinary team which in 2013\u000a      received &#163;157k funding from the Scottish Government to study the operation\u000a      of the Offensive\u000a      Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012.\u000a      The team's first\u000a      report will be submitted to the Scottish Government in November 2013 (i.e.\u000a      within the current REF\u000a      period).They are therefore continuing to impact on Scottish public policy\u000a      development beyond\u000a      academia by enriching and informing the understanding of the Scottish\u000a      Government and other key\u000a      non-academic stakeholders in this controversial area.\u000a    Impact on law-making by the Scottish Parliament\u000a    As a result of their expertise as articulated and demonstrated in the\u000a      underpinning research, Drs\u000a      Goodall and McArdle were invited to give evidence to the Justice Committee\u000a      of the Scottish\u000a      Parliament on the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening\u000a      Communications (Scotland) Bill\u000a      2011 as part of the formal law-making process. Their evidence, which is\u000a      extensive and drew upon\u000a      the ideas developed in the underpinning research, is available on the\u000a      official record of the Scottish\u000a      Parliament (see section 5, para.4 below). The research therefore\u000a      contributed to the debates,\u000a      scrutiny and law-making processes of the Scottish Parliament and had an\u000a      impact beyond\u000a      academia by enriching and informing law-making and public policy in\u000a      Scotland.\u000a    Dr Goodall and Dr McArdle were cited frequently by the Justice Committee\u000a      in its Stage 2 Report on\u000a      the Bill, which is also part of the law-making process in the Scottish\u000a      Parliament (see section 5,\u000a      para.5 below).\u000a    The Justice Committee specifically requested further clarification from\u000a      the Scottish Government in\u000a      respect of several of the points Dr Goodall and Dr McArdle had made, which\u000a      the Scottish\u000a      Government undertook to do when it published its response to the Justice\u000a      Committee's report in\u000a      October 2011. Dr Goodall and Dr McArdle also provided written submissions\u000a      on the Bill to the\u000a      Justice Committee, which was underpinned by their research (Dr McArdle's\u000a      submission was co-\u000a      authored with Dr Sarah Christie of Robert Gordon University).

This\u000a      has been developed and articulated throughout a range of articles,\u000a      including Dr Goodall's 2009\u000a      International Journal of Human Rights article `Challenging Hate Speech:\u000a      Incitement to Hatred on\u000a      Grounds of Sexual Orientation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland'.\u000a      This paper examines the\u000a      pieces of legislation that attempt to criminalise hate speech in this\u000a      context and considers whether\u000a      they can be kept sufficiently narrow to protect freedom of expression. It\u000a      concludes that in the UK,\u000a      closely drafted legislation to combat hate speech may indeed have a useful\u000a      impact and need not\u000a      lead to restrictions on freedom of expression. These same legal and\u000a      ethical issues are further\u000a      probed by Goodall throughout her body of work relating to the use of\u000a      legislation to criminalise hate\u000a      speech. Dr Goodall has continued her exploration of these issues, focusing\u000a      on the expression of\u000a      hate crime in sectarianism and racism, with a specific article on\u000a      sectarianism in the criminal law\u000a      (Edinburgh Law Review 2011) and a major project on conceptualising racism\u000a      in Scots Criminal\u000a      Law. Her expertise in the field of hate crime and legislation has had a\u000a      substantial impact beyond\u000a      academia on policy debate and law making on hate crime in Scotland during\u000a      the current REF\u000a      period.\u000a    While at Stirling, Dr McArdle was a co-author of the 2011 Scottish\u000a      Government report on football\u000a      fan banning orders. This report was one of the key starting points for the\u000a      Scottish Government\u000a      when developing a new policy in 2011-12 on how best to deal with\u000a      increasingly serious sectarian\u000a      public disorder (which in Scotland is often related to rival football\u000a      fans). The report found that while\u000a      the implementation of existing banning order legislation had improved and\u000a      that the banning orders\u000a      may have been of increasing utility in dealing with overall levels of\u000a      disorder, there were a number\u000a      of important issues which required action to improve effectiveness. As\u000a      detailed in section 4, Dr\u000a      McArdle's research expertise in the area of football banning orders, as\u000a      articulated in the official\u000a      Scottish Government report, had an impact beyond academia on the\u000a      development of policy and\u000a      law on football-related hate crime in Scotland during the current REF\u000a      period.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44228","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The LIS work has resulted in a number of impacts in terms of national\u000d      policy and also further research. Our work found that there were a number\u000d      of key differences between the approaches in England, Scotland and Wales\u000d      in terms of the relationship between central and local authorities; the\u000d      nature and definition of local values espoused; the organising process for\u000d      investigations and complaints; and, the number of allegations and\u000d      investigations received in each jurisdiction. In particular the report\u000d      found that in comparison to the number of local councils (including Parish\u000d      and Town Councils) that were covered by the integrity framework, the ratio\u000d      of allegations to councillors was low, and the ratio of breaches of the\u000d      code of conduct were lower still. Crucially our work suggested, however,\u000d      that for those involved in local government the framework was highly\u000d      valued despite these low rates, and indeed it was suggested that it might\u000d      have been a sign that the system worked.\u000d    These considerations became crucial in the decision over the fate of the\u000d      local integrity framework, which was perceived by the Conservative Party\u000d      whilst in opposition, as an unnecessary cost.\u000d    Standards for England used our comparative research as one of the\u000d      foundations for the report Local Standards 2.0 &#8212; the proportionality\u000d        upgrade? which was distributed to every local authority in England\u000d      and Wales. (1) and was also presented to the Department of Communities and\u000d      Local Government. Subsequently the entire local government integrity\u000d      framework for England in the Localism Act 2011 was overhauled.\u000d      Individuals have replaced local standards committees; Standards for\u000d      England has been abolished; and a new code of conduct for local government\u000d      has been instituted (2). Through the SfE's work the Sunderland research,\u000d      therefore, had a direct impact on major changes to UK local government\u000d      policy and regulation.\u000d    The LIS work also led to a number of broader impacts, howeverm which are\u000d      still being felt today. On the strength of its local government research,\u000d      for example, members of the Sunderland university team were asked to make\u000d      submissions to the Committee for Standards in Public Life report Standards\u000d        Matter (3). In addition members of the team were invited to make\u000d      submissions to the Triennial review of CSPL for the Cabinet Office in 2012\u000d      (4). The research was also the basis for further research by Michael\u000d      Macaulay on the initial impact of the Localism Act 2011, on the\u000d      local framework, which was published by Teesside University in 2012 and\u000d      was featured as a lead story in the local government magazine The\u000d        Municipal Journal (5)\u000d    The LIS has also resulted in a number of international impacts including\u000d      (a) advising Transparency International New Zealand's work on national and\u000d      local integrity (6), and (b) being employed as an international expert for\u000d      the Council of Europe in Ankara, Turkey, to develop integrity audit tools\u000d      (7).\u000d    Perhaps most tellingly the Sunderland research has been cited extensively\u000d      in Transparency International UK's most recent (October 2013) research on\u000d      local government corruption risks (8). The TI report was mentioned 13\u000d      times in the second reading debate on Local Audit &amp; Accountability\u000d        Bill. John McDonnell MP drew heavily from the report and Brandon\u000d      Lewis, Under Secretary of State for DCLG, acknowledged the report in the\u000d      House of Commons. The TI report has also featured extensively in national\u000d      and international media (9).\u000d    In short, the Sunderland LIS research has been led to publications in\u000d      international academic journals and it has had a direct impact on major\u000d      legislative changes in UK local government policy. It continues to have a\u000d      lasting impact in the UK policy arena through providing a foundation for\u000d      other major research projects such as the TI work, and also in the\u000d      continuing international reach of the research team. The whole nature of\u000d      the integrity framework in English local government has now fundamentally\u000d      altered, and the Sunderland research has played a significant role in\u000d      these developments.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    This case study centres on research, which had an impact on a major piece\u000d      of local government legislation.

The work was commissioned in\u000d      October 2009 through a competitive tender process and the research\u000d      contract was worth &#163;40,000. The election of the Coalition Government\u000d      brought an electoral commitment from DCLG to fundamentally alter the\u000d      structure and powers of local government in order to better reflect the\u000d      concept of `localism'. These myriad changes were manifested in the Localism\u000d        Act 2011. One of the major changes that was considered was to\u000d      England's local integrity framework, and to that end Standards for England\u000d      commissioned a comparative research project to form a submission to DCLG.\u000d      Professor Macaulay then of Teesside University, and a Visiting Professor\u000d      at the University of Sunderland was the Principal Investigator and project\u000d      manager; Dr Newman of Sunderland University was constitutional law\u000d      specialist, researcher and also workshop co-ordinator for the duration of\u000d      the project; two research assistants (Dr Rosemary Lucas and Dr Susan\u000d      Poole) were also part of the research team.\u000d    The team was awarded the project due to the researchers' track record in\u000d      local government integrity. Michael Macaulay has spent the last decade\u000d      researching local integrity in the UK, and his RAE 2008 submission was\u000d      predicated on research in this field that has been published in Public\u000d        Administration Review, Local Government Studies and other\u000d      internationally recognised journals. That body of knowledge was\u000d      significantly enhanced by Dr Newman's legal expertise.\u000d    The research was conducted between October 2009 and January 2010 and was\u000d      designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the local integrity frameworks\u000d      in England, Scotland and Wales. The study utilised a mixed methodology and\u000d      engaged with practitioners at all levels of local government: from members\u000d      of local standards committees, to national policy makers from around the\u000d      UK (e.g. Adjudication Panel, Local Government Ombudsman; Public Service\u000d      Ombudsman for Wales; Welsh Standards Commissioner; etc.). In total there\u000d      were approximately 20 practitioners and policy makers involved and they\u000d      were consulted with via one-on-one semi-structured interviews (for those\u000d      directly involved in local government) or by participation in a\u000d      development centre (held in Middlesbrough in December 2010) for those at a\u000d      national level. The Development Centre allowed high level policy makers to\u000d      reflect on initial comparative findings and established a direct route to\u000d      the local government community.\u000d    The significance of LIS studies has been recently recognised in two\u000d      separate symposium issues of leading journals both of which are to be\u000d      published later in 2013 (International Review of Administrative\u000d        Sciences and International Journal of Public Administration),\u000d      which Macaulay and Newman have contributed towards both as authors and\u000d      guest editors. Their research has led to a number of journal articles,\u000d      book chapters and conference papers in internationally recognised\u000d      publications (please see section 3).\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44230","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The impact of the underpinning research can be demonstrated in a number\u000d      of different areas: there is the impact on policy and practice; on the\u000d      media; and on further academic studies.\u000d    First, the research has had a direct impact on Transparency international\u000d      and TIUK in particular, in terms of both its future strategy and also its\u000d      future advocacy policy. These are summarised in its policy recommendations\u000d      document (1) and in its strategy document, summarised below. Following the\u000d      research, and as a direct result of its findings, TIUK produced a national\u000d      advocacy strategy, with four priority areas.\u000d    Perhaps more importantly, TIUK subsequently developed a \"Corruption\u000d      Scorecard', which also draws directly from our research and indicated a\u000d      number of red-flag areas that were uncovered during our investigation,\u000d      including prisons, money laundering and a lack of an overall national\u000d      strategy (2).\u000d    The research remains housed in its own discrete section on the TIUK\u000d      website\u000d      (http:\/\/www.transparency.org.uk\/our-work\/corruption-in-the-uk)\u000d      and the reports have been downloaded over 5000 times (http:\/\/www.transparency.org.uk\/our-work\/publications\/81-corruption-in-the-uk--overview-&amp;-policy-recommendations).\u000d    Yet the impact here is not simply on TIUK but on a much broader policy\u000d      and practice, the NIS study elicited a personal response from the Prime\u000d      Minister David Cameron (3) and has led to a number of questions being\u000d      raised in Parliament, particularly around corruption in prisons and the\u000d      recent restructuring of HM Prison's Corruption Prevention Unit (4). The\u000d      research has also been cited and used in the Home Office's 2011 strategy\u000d      on Organised Crime (5). In October 2013 the newly formed National Crime\u000d      Agency released its inaugural strategy to fight organised crime (CM 8715)\u000d      and the TIUK was again cited (6).\u000d    The research has already made an impact in academic circles and is cited\u000d      extensively in Nicholl's et al (2011) second edition of Corruption and\u000d        Misconduct in Public Office (7). The work has also received major\u000d      media coverage including BBC television, The Guardian, The Telegraph and\u000d      the Wall Street Journal. In February 2012, for example, it was included as\u000d      the subject of a commentary in The Guardian (8).\u000d    The NIS work has also resulted in a number of other national and\u000d      international impacts including advising Transparency International New\u000d      Zealand's work on national and local integrity (9); being employed as an\u000d      international expert for the Council of Europe in Ankara, developing\u000d      integrity audit audit tools (10).\u000d    In summation the research on integrity systems has had a tangible and\u000d      demonstrable impact not only on the sponsor organisation, TIUK, but also\u000d      on national and international policy, and has been used by government\u000d      departments, law enforcement agencies, and European bodies. That the\u000d      research is still being directly cited by a newly created agency such as\u000d      the National Crime Agency, as recently, as October 2013, hopefully\u000d      establishes that the impact in ongoing and that the Sunderland work is\u000d      being utilised at the highest policy levels.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    This case study centres on a body of work commissioned by Transparency\u000d      international UK looking at corruption in the UK.

In\u000d      2010 TIUK commissioned a suite of research, which involved both\u000d      quantitative and qualitative studies. The research was subject to a\u000d      competitive tender and was (in total) worth approximately &#163;35,000. The\u000d      research comprised three inter-related studies:\u000d    (1) a national public opinion survey, (published Dec 2010);\u000d    (2) an investigation into corruption risks in key sectors in the UK (e.g.\u000d      police, prisons, legal services &#8212; published July 2011).\u000d    (3) An assessment of the UK National Integrity System (published July\u000d      2011).\u000d    In part, the projects were awarded on Michael Macaulay's previous\u000d      experience in working on the 2003 National Integrity System, upon which\u000d      the new study was founded. TIUK has argued that, together, this body of\u000d      research represents \"the most comprehensive research ever undertaken in\u000d      this area\" (http:\/\/www.transparency.org.uk\/our-work\/corruption-in-the-uk).\u000a      To date the reports have been downloaded over 5000 times (http:\/\/www.transparency.org.uk\/our-work\/publications\/81-corruption-in-the-uk--overview-&amp;-policy-recommendations).\u000d    The NIS concept was originally created in the late 1990's but in 2010 a\u000d      new methodology was introduced comprising key respondent interviews, desk\u000d      based research and quantitative assessment. Previously there was no fixed\u000d      methodology for the NIS (despite there being nearly one hundred studies\u000d      having been conducted). The UK study was the first in a 26-wide EU-funded\u000d      project to assess European integrity and was one of the very first\u000d      assessments in the world (and the first in the EU) to be published using\u000d      this new methodology. For full details on the TI European NIS Project\u000d      please see http:\/\/www.transparency.org\/enis.\u000d    Michael Macaulay was the principal investigator all three projects and is\u000d      a Visiting Professor within the Law Department at the University of\u000d      Sunderland. Chris Newman was invited to participate I the National\u000d      Integrity System study as a legal expert with a particular interest into\u000d      the sections on corruption legislation and the judiciary. Dr Newman is\u000d      named in the report as an advisor .\u000d    As evidence of the quality of work, each piece of TIUK research was peer\u000d      reviewed by leading academics in the field of corruption including Alyson\u000d      Warhurst (Warwick University); Indira Carr (Surrey University); Michael\u000d      Levy (University of Cardiff) and John Hatchard (Open University). In\u000d      addition the NIS study was subjected to a validation workshop of over 40\u000d      leading academics and practitioners before its results were published.\u000d    The suite of research brought us into direct contact with leading\u000d      practitioners and policy makers from law enforcement agencies (the\u000d      respective Heads of the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the Serious\u000d      Fraud Office were both interviewees; as well as the ex-Chief Inspector of\u000d      HM Prisons); from political organisations and Parliament (including a\u000d      number of members of eth House of Lords); the CBI's head of governance;\u000d      and leading Civil Society organisations.\u000d    The suite of research, therefore, pioneered new methodologies; directly\u000d      dealt with leading practitioners; and has been adopted in new studies such\u000d      as the TI New Zealand NIS study. The research has led to a number of\u000d      journal articles, book chapters and conference papers in internationally\u000d      recognised academic forums (please see section 3).\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44380","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    By 2011 in the UK, around 27,000 people were being subjected to\u000a      immigration detention each\u000a      year, at a cost of &#163;130M. Trends at a global level also suggest increasing\u000a      use of the practice over\u000a      the past 30 years. During 2011, for example, the USA detained 429,000\u000a      immigrants under such\u000a      powers, at a cost of $1.7B. In response, a large number of NGOs worldwide\u000a      are seeking to\u000a      improve detention practices. In addition, government officials and judges\u000a      often have to rule on\u000a      detention cases. Publication of the research led Wilsher to be approached\u000a      by external\u000a      organisations and government bodies in the UK and abroad for advice. The\u000a      research enabled\u000a      Wilsher to help create new standards and influence reforms and campaigning\u000a      to improve the rights\u000a      of detainees through a number of routes:\u000a\u000a\u0009  The UK Supreme Court cited Wilsher's work in the landmark decision in\u000a      A and Others v\u000a        Secretary of State for the Home Department (known as the `Belmarsh\u000a      decision')5, one of\u000a      the most important cases in recent British and global human rights law. It\u000a      ruled that\u000a      immigration powers could not be used to detain foreigners without trial\u000a      simply on suspicion\u000a      of them having connections to terrorist groups. This led the UK Government\u000a      to repeal part\u000a      of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act and rethink its\u000a      counter-terrorism strategy. It is\u000a      extremely rare for an academic to be cited in the UK courts. The case has\u000a      been cited by\u000a      other judges in, for example, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong\u000a      and India on over\u000a      150 occasions when courts have had to decide upon the appropriate limits\u000a      upon\u000a      immigration detention. Wilsher's work was also relied upon in submissions\u000a      by Justice in\u000a      another recent case before the Supreme Court R (appn) Lumba and Mighty\u000a        v Secretary of\u000a        State [2011] UKSC 12, which ruled on the long-term detention of\u000a      foreign national criminals\u000a      post-sentence when the Court ruled that detention could not be based upon\u000a      secret\u000a      unpublished policies.\u000a    A joint report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons and Independent Chief\u000a      Inspector of Borders\u000a      and Immigration &#8212; `The effectiveness and impact of immigration detention\u000a      casework'\u000a      (December 2012, pp. 30-35) - drew extensively on Wilsher's work. This\u000a      report was\u000a      prepared in order to research and suggest reforms to the detention of\u000a      foreign national\u000a      prisoners pending their deportation to reduce cost and needless\u000a      deprivation of liberty. It\u000a      argued that non-cooperation by detainees with their removal should be\u000a      dealt with by\u000a      criminal law and not administrative detention. This was one of the main\u000a      arguments of the\u000a      author's book that was extensively quoted. The Home Office response\u000a      accepted most of\u000a      the recommendations of the report, in particular the need to resolve cases\u000a      during the\u000a      criminal sentence rather than using administrative detention.6\u000a\u000a    In 2010 Wilsher was approached to act as an expert consultant to the\u000a      Turkish Ministry of\u000a      Interior to assist in drafting their rule-book for immigration detention\u000a      facilities. This involved\u000a      detailed discussion and redrafting of the standards that bind detention\u000a      centres in Turkey,\u000a      which is a major transit route for migrants. Its detention centres have\u000a      been heavily criticised\u000a      by the European Commissioner for Human Rights, Thomas Hammarberg, for\u000a      lengthy and\u000a      unlawful detention. Wilsher noted unlawful areas in current Turkish\u000a      practice that did not\u000a      specify time limits to detention. The rules were changed, which led to\u000a      detainees having\u000a      stronger legal guarantees against arbitrary detention. The final\u000a      publication, Refugees,\u000a        asylum-seekers and illegal migrants (2011)7, Turkish\u000a      Ministry of the Interior No. 687,\u000a      contained an important set of performance criteria requiring detention\u000a      centres to show that\u000a      all detentions are justified on an ongoing basis.\u000a    In 2010--2011, Wilsher was approached to act as a member of an expert\u000a      committee\u000a      formed by the Equal Rights Trust (ERT), a leading anti-discrimination\u000a      charity, in the drafting\u000a      of their report Unravelling anomaly: detention, discrimination and the\u000a        protection needs of\u000a        stateless persons and of their follow-up Guidelines to Protect\u000a        Stateless Persons from\u000a        Arbitrary Detention (June 2012)8. According to the lead\u000a      author and Director of ERT, Dr\u000a      Wilsher was highly influential in shaping the guidelines to reflect\u000a      international best practice\u000a      and contributed to a reconsideration of the way that NGOs promote the\u000a      rights of detained\u000a      stateless persons (those who have no nationality, or no effective\u000a      nationality, and therefore\u000a      do not benefit from the protection of any state but are also vulnerable to\u000a      being detained for\u000a      long periods as a result of the difficulty in identifying a country that\u000a      will accept them and\u000a      cooperate with proceedings). Previously, NGOs had unconvincingly attempted\u000a      to align this\u000a      group with refugees and asylum-seekers. Wilsher drew their attention to\u000a      wider\u000a      jurisprudence to show that this was not necessary. The launch event\u000a      involved the ERT\u000a      President Sir Bob Hepple (a world-renowned discrimination lawyer), Sir\u000a      Stephen Sedley (a\u000a      retired Court of Appeal judge) and representatives from United Nations\u000a      (UN) High\u000a      Commissioner Refugees. One commentator said, `These Guidelines fill a\u000a        significant gap in\u000a        international law standards, and reflect the weight of expert opinion of\u000a        how some of the\u000a        most vulnerable people on earth should be treated under international\u000a        human rights law'\u000a        (Colm O'Cinneide, Ireland; Vice-President, European Committee\u000a      on Social Rights). The\u000a      Guidelines have been used as training materials by the International\u000a      Detention Coalition\u000a      (the leading NGO in the field, with 300 member groups drawn from 50\u000a      countries) at their\u000a      regional civil society training workshops in Asia, Africa and Europe. They\u000a      have also been\u000a      used by the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network (the leading NGO in the\u000a      region, which co-\u000a      ordinates 140 member groups).\u000a    In 2010 Wilsher was approached by Bail for Immigration Detainees, the\u000a      leading UK charity\u000a      dedicated to policy reform in the field of detention. It liaises closely\u000a      with the Home Office\u000a      and the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. The author provided guidance on\u000a      their research\u000a      study A nice judge on a good day: immigration bail and the right to\u000a        liberty, a large study of\u000a      immigration bail practice by judges across the UK tribunal system.9\u000a      Wilsher was able to\u000a      draw upon his research into the working of the UK bail system to help\u000a      design the bail\u000a      hearing observation framework that the report relied upon for its\u000a      findings. The report was\u000a      used as evidence in discussions with the judiciary and the Home Office.\u000a      The result was a\u000a      detailed new set of Bail Guidance for Immigration Judges, issued in 2012.10\u000a      This is binding\u000a      on judges in the UK courts when they are deciding whether to release\u000a      immigrants from\u000a      detention. The new Guidance reflects the fundamental rights contained in\u000a      UN international\u000a      standards that require detention to be neither unnecessary nor too\u000a      lengthy. The author was\u000a      able to contribute further to the development and application\u000a      of the new bail guidance in his\u000a      role as a judge at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.\u000a    In 2011-2012 Wilsher was approached to work extensively with the\u000a      Global Detention\u000a      Project (GDP) based at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. This is a unique\u000a      international\u000a      research and campaigning body that is funded by the Soros Foundation. Its\u000a      goal is to\u000a      monitor detention at a global level and provide information for NGOs to\u000a      use in campaigning\u000a      and policy change. It has the most extensive reach of any global research\u000a      body in this field,\u000a      with an expanding research base that covers some 50 countries. In 2012\u000a      Wilsher presented\u000a      some of his research findings at the GDP to an invited expert audience,\u000a      including staff from\u000a      the UN High Commission for Refugees. He has since helped GDP to design a\u000a      framework\u000a      for assessing and comparing detention centres across countries by\u000a      reference to legal\u000a      standards. The aim is to produce a map of detention practice. Wilsher used\u000a      his research\u000a      findings on the nature of different detention regimes to help compile\u000a      agreed and relevant\u000a      indices to measure detention, such as duration, access to judicial review\u000a      and basic\u000a      standards of care. The database will help researchers and NGOs worldwide\u000a      to influence\u000a      detention policy by giving them the best and most consistent dataset. The\u000a      data categories\u000a      have been compiled and the data collection is continuing.11\u000a\u000a\u0009  \u000a    This research helped to provide better access to justice for immigration\u000a      detainees who are often\u000a      vulnerable and ostracised. It also led to greater accountability of\u000a      governments in the UK and\u000a      Turkey in relation to their detention policies. This was achieved by\u000a      influencing courts, officials and\u000a      NGOs to change the legal framework and policies surrounding detention. A\u000a      broader impact was\u000a      also felt in a number of courts in Commonwealth, which used the research\u000a      in deciding cases\u000a      relating to the detention of immigrants.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Immigration detention is a widespread practice in the UK and beyond.\u000a      Thousands of vulnerable\u000a      individuals are held for long periods without trial or proper access to\u000a      justice.

It is\u000a      largely unregulated, giving\u000a      government officials great power to decide on whom to detain and whom to\u000a      release. Research\u000a      undertaken by Dr Daniel Wilsher (Senior Lecturer in Law at City University\u000a      London since 2004)\u000a      aimed to develop legal and ethical standards to regulate immigration\u000a      detention to protect the rule of\u000a      law. The research proposed standards to inform policy-makers and key\u000a      actors in the field to\u000a      improve the balance between migration control and fundamental rights. In\u000a      particular, arguments\u000a      were made for the importance of judicial review, time limits on detention\u000a      and the elimination of\u000a      detention of vulnerable groups such as children.\u000a    The work analysed extensively the historical practices and legal\u000a      framework surrounding the global\u000a      expansion of immigration detention. The research revealed the\u000a      vulnerability of the liberty of\u000a      migrants. It also showed that legal systems had found great difficulty in\u000a      providing appropriate\u000a      safeguards for immigrants. The traditional social contract view had\u000a      remained influential; persons\u000a      who had not yet been accepted into society found it difficult to claim its\u000a      protection.\u000a    The main outputs were a series of academic articles and a book-length\u000a      study, the first in book form\u000a      to take a global and historical approach to this important topic of public\u000a      concern.

The\u000d\u000a      extent of this impact can be gauged by the nature and variety of cases in\u000d\u000a      which it has occurred. The impact in appellate decisions is of particular\u000d\u000a      importance because when material is cited with approval, it becomes a part\u000d\u000a      of the law and a binding precedent.\u000d\u000a    a) in the United Kingdom\u000d\u000a    Blackstone's Criminal Practice has been cited with approval and\/or\u000d\u000a      applied by judges in the UK in relation to:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      when it is appropriate to give the jury a `Lucas' direction (a\u000d\u000a        direction to the jury on lies told by the accused) in R v Marsh\u000d\u000a        [2009] EWCA Crim 2696, an appeal against conviction of murder, Court of\u000d\u000a        Appeal, Criminal Division at [66]\u000d\u000a      what types of evidence may constitute `supporting material' for the\u000d\u000a        purposes of `Makanjuola' warnings (a warning to the jury about acting on\u000d\u000a        the evidence of impugned or unreliable witnesses) in R v Brown\u000d\u000a        [2009] NICC 21, a murder trial in Northern Ireland at [104].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Blackstone's Criminal Practice has also had an impact on the way\u000d\u000a      in which judges direct juries. Crown Court judges in England and Wales, in\u000d\u000a      deciding how to direct the jury, make use of the Bench Book issued\u000d\u000a      by the Judicial College, the body overseen by the Lord Chief Justice and\u000d\u000a      with responsibility for the provision of training for judicial\u000d\u000a      office-holders. The Bench Book contains `model' directions to\u000d\u000a      juries as well as advice on the law of criminal evidence and in both\u000d\u000a      respects it expressly refers to and relies upon Blackstone's Criminal\u000d\u000a        Practice. It does so on the subjects of circumstantial evidence,\u000d\u000a      expert evidence, corroboration and the special need for caution, lies, and\u000d\u000a      conducting a view [1]. These references assist judges to ensure that\u000d\u000a      juries are directed on these evidential issues as clearly and consistently\u000d\u000a      as possible. They also benefit judges in their understanding of the law of\u000d\u000a      evidence in these areas and therefore in their capability and performance.\u000d\u000a    Blackstone's Criminal Practice has also had an impact on educators\u000d\u000a      and students that extends significantly beyond the submitting higher\u000d\u000a      education institution, being among the practitioner works regarded by the\u000d\u000a      Bar Standards Board as an authoritative and reliable source and therefore\u000d\u000a      listed in its mandatory reading lists for `Criminal Litigation, Evidence\u000d\u000a      and Sentencing' specified for use by all Bar Professional Training Course\u000d\u000a      providers [2].\u000d\u000a    b) internationally\u000d\u000a    The Modern Law of Evidence has been cited with approval and\/or\u000d\u000a      applied by judges overseas in relation to:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the principle that adverse inferences can be drawn from failure to\u000d\u000a        give evidence, in Presho v Doohan [2010] 1EHC 148, High Court,\u000d\u000a        Ireland at [4]\u000d\u000a      the way in which the judge should direct the jury about the dangers of\u000d\u000a        visual identification evidence, in Maitland Reckford v R [2010]\u000d\u000a        JMCA 40, Court of Appeal, Jamaica at [25], an appeal against conviction\u000d\u000a        of murder, and Raymond Hunter v R [2011] JMCA Crim 20, Court of\u000d\u000a        Appeal, Jamaica at [29].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The underpinning research of The Modern Law of Evidence and Blackstone's\u000a        Criminal Practice has also changed and benefited the awareness,\u000d\u000a      capacity, performance and understanding of those engaged in reforming the\u000d\u000a      law of criminal evidence in China.\u000d\u000a    Professor Keane's international reputation as the author\/co-author of\u000d\u000a      these authoritative sources led to his selection by the Great Britain\u000d\u000a      China Centre (a public body that promotes understanding between China and\u000d\u000a      the UK), on behalf of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), as the\u000d\u000a      only non-Chinese scholar to participate in a project to be carried out by\u000d\u000a      the Centre for Criminal Procedure Reform (CCPR), Renmin University,\u000d\u000a      Beijing. Professor Keane's participation was funded by the FCO from its\u000d\u000a      Human Rights and Democracy Fund.\u000d\u000a    The project related to coerced confessions and their exclusion, the use\u000d\u000a      of `concealed evidence' and the use of evidence obtained through special\u000d\u000a      investigative measures such as tapping phones, using undercover police\u000d\u000a      officers and entrapment. The aim of the project included the encouragement\u000d\u000a      of a more uniform understanding among the Chinese judiciary of how the\u000d\u000a      rules in these areas should be interpreted and implemented. The aim was\u000d\u000a      also to draft proposals for the National People's Congress, for reform of\u000d\u000a      the Criminal Procedure Law in order to enhance rectitude of\u000d\u000a      decision-making and minimise the risk of miscarriages of justice and the\u000d\u000a      negative international reputation that they engendered (famously, for\u000d\u000a      example, in the case in which the `victim' of a murder walked back into\u000d\u000a      his village after the trial that had resulted in the conviction and\u000d\u000a      execution of the accused). The project was led by Professor Chen Weidong,\u000d\u000a      a legislation expert consultant with responsibility for advising the\u000d\u000a      legislative affairs committee of the National People's Congress. Drawing\u000d\u000a      materially and distinctly upon his own research in the relevant areas,\u000d\u000a      Professor Keane made two trips to Beijing (in June and December 2011). He\u000d\u000a      gave written and oral advice to Professor Weidong, to members of the CCPR\u000d\u000a      (including specific advice on the report of its empirical research), and\u000d\u000a      to a large number of senior judges from the Supreme People's Court and\u000d\u000a      from the Intermediate People's Courts of various Provinces.\u000d\u000a    The project achieved a number of important outcomes: a comprehensive\u000d\u000a      analysis of the problems relating to implementation of the relevant rules\u000d\u000a      in the Chinese legal system; practical suggestions for judicial\u000d\u000a      application in pilot courts and, most significantly, adoption by the\u000d\u000a      National People's Congress of some of its most important recommendations\u000d\u000a      for reform of the law. The amendments were included in the revised\u000d\u000a      Criminal Procedure Law which was adopted in March 2012 and came into force\u000d\u000a      on 1st January 2013.\u000d\u000a    The most important of the amendments make provision for:\u000d\u000a    (i) the right to appoint a lawyer when first interrogated (Art 33)\u000d\u000a    (ii) the duty to inform a suspect of that right (Art 34)\u000d\u000a    (iii) no person to be forced to prove his own guilt (Art 50)\u000d\u000a    (iv) in cases where there is no confession, facts to establish guilt to\u000d\u000a      be proved beyond reasonable doubt (Art 53)\u000d\u000a    (v) criminal prosecutions to be instigated where the collection of\u000d\u000a      evidence involves the commission of a crime (Art 55)\u000d\u000a    (vi) in cases where it is in dispute whether evidence was obtained\u000d\u000a      illegally, the burden to be on the prosecution to prove that it was not so\u000d\u000a      obtained (Art 57)\u000d\u000a    (vii)where the court believes it to be necessary for a witness to appear\u000d\u000a      before the court to testify, power to compel any such witness, except a\u000d\u000a      spouse, parent or child of the accused (Arts 187 and 188).\u000d\u000a    These changes are modelled on the English law of evidence advocated by\u000d\u000a      Professor Keane to members of the CCPR and others (detailed above). The\u000d\u000a      changes, including in particular the adoption of such fundamental rights\u000d\u000a      as the privilege against self-incrimination and the right of access to an\u000d\u000a      independent lawyer before interrogation, amount to a major re-balancing of\u000d\u000a      the Chinese criminal justice system in favour of the accused. The changes\u000d\u000a      also strengthen the hand of the judiciary vis-&#224;-vis the police\u000d\u000a      authorities and the procurator's office: for the first time, a trial judge\u000d\u000a      has the power to compel all but immediate family of the accused to give\u000d\u000a      evidence, a power of special importance when the judge wants to go beyond\u000d\u000a      the written statements of those who arrested and interrogated the accused.\u000d\u000a      The changes will improve the quality of the administration of Chinese\u000d\u000a      criminal justice by ensuring fairer criminal trials and reducing the\u000d\u000a      potential for miscarriages of justice.\u000d\u000a    [In the case of all references in this section to co-authored research,\u000d\u000a      the citations relate to material produced exclusively by Professor Keane.]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Adrian Keane's research relates to the law of criminal\u000d\u000a      evidence, that body of law which regulates the means by which facts can be\u000d\u000a      proved in criminal trials.

This was visible\u000a      during the June 2011 `Working Conference of the Initiative on Impunity and\u000a      the Rule of Law', held at City, which was attended by many stakeholders\u000a      including: senior members of international and intergovernmental\u000a      organisations such as UNESCO, the Organization for Security and\u000a      Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Inter-American Committee on Human\u000a      Rights; and journalists' federations and expert NGOs such as Amnesty,\u000a      Article 19, Journalistes en Danger, Reporters without Borders and the Red\u000a      Cross. Participants included the Assistant Director-General of UNESCO,\u000a      Janis Karklins and the Director of Human Rights of the UK Foreign Office,\u000a      Susan Hyland. UNESCO considered the conference to be a major international\u000a      and interdisciplinary event aimed at developing new global initiatives\u000a      intended to protect journalists and end the impunity of those who\u000a      threaten, assault or murder them. UNESCO stated on its website (2011) that\u000a      the Initiative `has already received the backing of Archbishop Desmond\u000a      Tutu, a long-time advocate for the worldwide protection of journalists'\u000a      rights'. Archbishop Tutu also sent a special message to the conference.\u000a      The conference marked the launch of a topical report by the New York-based\u000a      NGO, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) which revealed that 13\u000a      countries around the world had five or more unsolved cases of murdered\u000a      journalists committed during the past decade. The conference attracted the\u000a      sponsorship described in section 3.\u000a    UNESCO made use of the Initiative's London Conference as a preparatory\u000a      meeting for its Inter-Agency Meeting in Paris and stated on its website:\u000a      `As a first step towards this event [the UN Inter-Agency meeting], a\u000a      meeting entitled \"Safety and Protection for Journalists: A Responsibility\u000a      for the World\" was organised in June 2011 by the Initiative on Impunity\u000a      and the Rule of Law. The conclusions drawn from this meeting will be\u000a      presented at the UN Inter-Agency Meeting in Paris.' Research and policy\u000a      proposals prepared by the City research team became reference materials\u000a      for this meeting. Archbishop Tutu's speech at the conference raised\u000a      awareness about violence against media workers throughout society and\u000a      appealed to world governments for urgent intervention. Draghici and Woods\u000a      delivered proposals based on previous research (the scoping exercise)\u000a      carried out by Xenos, to strengthen existing UN mechanisms for increasing\u000a      co-operation and preventing attacks against journalists.\u000a    The Initiative produced a valuable impact on public engagement by\u000a      creating an international platform of academic and legal expertise\u000a      comprising governmental and non-governmental experts from organisations\u000a      (including International Bar Associations, Index on Censorship, OSCE,\u000a      Columbia Law School, Saferworld, the UK House of Lords, The Salzburg\u000a      Global Seminar and UN, Media Legal Defence Initiative and International\u000a      News Safety Institute) to seek acceptance for fighting violence against\u000a      journalists and the right of citizens to be informed. A list of relevant\u000a      resources and working papers is accessible on the Initiative website.\u000a    The City Law School (represented by Draghici) was subsequently invited to\u000a      participate in the Paris conference at UNESCO Headquarters in September\u000a      2011, an invitation-only policy-making event. The Legal Instruments Study\u000a      reached a significantly wider number of beneficiaries in this context,\u000a      including state delegations from all geopolitical areas of the world,\u000a      global and regional inter-governmental organisations and representatives\u000a      of cross-border civil society. City's research, by filling a gap in the\u000a      legal resources available, drew the attention of international\u000a      organisations to the deficit in implementation measures. It further\u000a      supported the priorities of the UN Plan of Action, aimed inter alia\u000a      at assisting countries in the development of legislation and mechanisms\u000a      compliant with international rules and essential for the creation of a\u000a      free and safe environment for journalists and media workers in conflict\u000a      and non-conflict zones. This is promoted by UNESCO as one of its\u000a      Communication and Information Themes [8]. The participation of academics\u000a      in the consultation process of inter-governmental organisation is\u000a      exceptional and indicative of the impact of this research. Woods was also\u000a      contacted by Mr Ian White on behalf of UNESCO UK in August 2013 to comment\u000a      on the draft response by the UK National Commission for UNESCO to the\u000a      proposed UN Plan of Action for the Safety of Journalists.\u000a    Draghici subsequently received further invitations to comment on and\u000a      contribute to the UN inter-agency implementation plan. She took part in\u000a      the 2nd Inter-Agency Meeting on `The Safety of Journalists and\u000a      the Issue of Impunity' held in Vienna in November 2012, where she provided\u000a      information on the main streams of City's work on safety of journalists\u000a      and on media rights. She also raised awareness of the CLJJ\u000a      interdisciplinary conference designed to celebrate World Press Freedom\u000a      Day, which took place on 3rd May 2013 [9]. This conference,\u000a      entitled `Obstacles to Free Speech and the Safety of Journalists', was an\u000a      activity which formed part of and is specifically referenced in the UNESCO\u000a      Implementation Strategy 2013-2014 [10]. At the conference, Draghici shared\u000a      the results of further research carried out with Woods since the 2011\u000a      report in a presentation entitled `Individual Torts and Collective\u000a      Victims: The Societal Impact of Crimes Against Journalists in\u000a      International Law'.\u000a    The legal study also provided a useful tool in shaping the advocacy\u000a      strategy of international non-governmental organisations. By invitation of\u000a      Mr Jim Boumelha, the President of the International Federation of\u000a      Journalists (IFJ), Woods gave a presentation on 26th October\u000a      2012 on the research findings at a one-day Summit in Nuremberg on the\u000a      safety of journalism aimed at discussing the IFJ future strategy, which\u000a      gathered inter alia IFJ members and representatives of UNESCO and\u000a      the International Red Cross. Mr Boumelha subsequently responded to City's\u000a      invitation to take part in the May 2013 conference, indicating the\u000a      interest of rights campaigners in continuing the exchange of information\u000a      and expertise with The City Law School.\u000a    The consultation proved crucial to shaping policy interventions and the\u000a      coordination of inter-agency mechanisms. It suggested high-level expert\u000a      consultations for the Austrian government at the UN Human Rights Council\u000a      and informed the final UN Action Plan to combat violence against\u000a      journalists on how to monitor progress at both national and international\u000a      levels. This Action Plan, prepared during the first UN Inter-Agency\u000a      Meeting on `The Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity', will\u000a      establish an inter-agency mechanism to monitor progress and assist\u000a      countries in the development of legislation favouring freedom of\u000a      expression. Evidence of the City contribution can be identified in the\u000a      UNESCO Implementation Strategy 2013-2014) [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Initiative on Impunity and the Rule of Law, a joint project of the\u000a      Centre for Law, Justice and Journalism, City University London and the\u000a      Centre for Freedom of the Media, University of Sheffield, has played an\u000a      agenda-setting role in a campaign involving several non-governmental and\u000a      inter-governmental bodies.

The Initiative also presented several reports\u000a      providing material for collaborative consultation with members of The Open\u000a      Society Foundation, Norwegian PEN (part of International PEN &#8212; the\u000a      worldwide association of writers) and UNESCO. The legal work is\u000a      complemented by sociological work by Tumber et al. since 2004 and\u000a      by a Political Aspects Study produced by Horsley (CFOM) in May 2011, also\u000a      presented at the June 2011 Conference. A comprehensive database detailing\u000a      key organisations in the protection of human rights, freedom of\u000a      information and safety of journalists was also compiled by Dr Dinardi\u000a      (Research Officer at City since 2009) to inform the Conference.\u000a    The research rested on a mapping of international instruments for the\u000a      protection of journalists with a view to identifying normative and\u000a      implementation lacunae and possible solutions thereto. It provided\u000a      evidence that the rights at stake (life, personal liberty and integrity,\u000a      freedom from inhuman treatment, freedom of expression and effective\u000a      remedy) are guaranteed in all general human rights instruments and have\u000a      been interpreted broadly by international monitoring bodies to include\u000a      positive obligations such as investigation and punishment of perpetrators.\u000a      Further, in times of war, journalists are entitled to protection as\u000a      civilians and benefit from the belligerent parties' obligations to\u000a      discriminate them from legitimate military targets. Notwithstanding this\u000a      multiplicity of normative systems, there are no binding instruments\u000a      specifically concerned with the risks facing journalists and states are\u000a      reluctant to accept supra-national monitoring institutions due to concerns\u000a      over erosion of state sovereignty. A lack of resources also affects the\u000a      implementation of positive obligations (e.g., effective police and\u000a      judicial systems) as well as the functioning of relevant international\u000a      bodies. The report formulated a series of proposals to enhance the\u000a      enforcement of journalists' rights, including a specific instrument for\u000a      the protection of journalists as a vulnerable category and as holders of a\u000a      public role, given the impact of attacks against them upon the public's\u000a      right to information and democratic control over ruling elites.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44432","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research which led to the impact is the work of one academic, O'Neill.\u000d\u000a      Research was conducted in the context of regular engagement with the law\u000d\u000a      enforcement community, particularly in Scotland, both before, during and\u000d\u000a      after research was conducted. This regular engagement led to targeted\u000d\u000a      research of direct relevance to the law enforcement community, both at UK\u000d\u000a      and International (to include EU) level. This led to effective engagement\u000d\u000a      at the policy level, with research directly informing responses to the\u000d\u000a      House of Lords' consultation process. This is reflected in the fact that\u000d\u000a      many of O'Neill's responses to the consultation ran in parallel\u000d\u000a      with responses from the law enforcement and criminal justice community\u000d\u000a      across the UK and beyond. It was anticipated at the very beginning of the\u000d\u000a      development of the research, during this REF period, that regular\u000d\u000a      engagement with this particular practitioner community would lead to\u000d\u000a      research output that would have a significant impact.\u000d\u000a    The direct audience for the impact claimed is the House of Lords'\u000d\u000a      European Union Committee, and thence to Parliament and the UK Government.\u000d\u000a      Material has also been made available by the House of Lords for reporting\u000d\u000a      purposes to the national press and other interested parties.

O'Neill's unique contribution to the report was\u000d\u000a      academic in nature and provided high level rationale, rather than a\u000d\u000a      practitioner perspective which focused on the operational aspects.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore her perspective was EU-wide, rather than from a national (e.g.\u000d\u000a      criminal law) perspective but nonetheless informed by deep knowledge of\u000d\u000a      Scottish police practices and procedure. In addition, her research has\u000d\u000a      focused on the security and law enforcement aspect of the Area of Freedom\u000d\u000a      Security and Justice of the EU, rather than the civil rights aspects,\u000d\u000a      which was covered by other contributors.\u000d\u000a    The impact being claimed is\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      on the drafting of the final House of Lords Report,\u000d\u000a      the influence of the report on the national debate,\u000d\u000a      in due course having an influence on the Governments\/ Ministerial\u000d\u000a        decision, which will,\u000d\u000a      impact on the UK relations with the EU, and through the EU, the rest\u000d\u000a        of the world.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The evidence submitted is the House of Lord's published report,\u000d\u000a      supporting online videos, and the House of Lords web site which provides\u000d\u000a      an overview of the development of the debate (some of which will be\u000d\u000a      outside the REF period).\u000d\u000a    The debate on this issue was opened by the Home Secretary on the 15th\u000d\u000a      October 2012.

The black letter law\u000d\u000a      outputs, listed at 3, in particular those marked REF2, are also based on\u000d\u000a      interaction with, in particular, the Scottish police services. They\u000d\u000a      develop an understanding of police concerns in the context of cross-border\u000d\u000a      law enforcement, and a level of understanding of the issues which arise in\u000d\u000a      practice. This was facilitated by one to one interviews with senior\u000d\u000a      members of police staff (not reflected in the research output) and more\u000d\u000a      generally through membership of the Scottish Institute of Policing\u000d\u000a      Research (SIPR), which facilitates police\/ academic interaction. The\u000d\u000a      researcher's ability to provide material of immediate use to the police is\u000d\u000a      reflected in repeated requests to present to police or police\/academic\u000d\u000a      events, and publication in police practitioner journals (in particular the\u000d\u000a      UK and Austria). Output has been made available on line, with details\u000d\u000a      circulated through SIPR, which has a UK and international police and\u000d\u000a      academic readership. The research output is both of a high academic level,\u000d\u000a      and focused on key practitioner issues.\u000d\u000a    Research in this area is predominantly about the significance of the\u000d\u000a      structures and legal frameworks dealing with cross-border drugs\u000d\u000a      trafficking\/ organised crime, and counter-terrorism operations, involving\u000d\u000a      what are now the 28 member states of the EU.

O'Neill's research provides a\u000d\u000a      distinctive voice in the debate in this area, approaching the area from\u000d\u000a      the perspective of EU law, rather than a (UK) criminal law approach to the\u000d\u000a      issues, coupled with a deep appreciation of the police practitioner\u000d\u000a      perspective, rather than the human rights\/ justice focus. All outputs for\u000d\u000a      O'Neill submitted for this REF fall into this category. Her\u000d\u000a      counter-terrorism monograph is the first such publication focusing on the\u000d\u000a      EU developments in this area. The engagement with the UK legislature is a\u000d\u000a      direct consequence of these research outputs.\u000d\u000a    The above research led to an ability to respond effectively to the House\u000d\u000a      of Lords' call for evidence on the UK's 2014 opt-out decision. By\u000d\u000a      approaching the matter from an EU perspective, and providing the only\u000d\u000a      academic voice with a distinctive Scottish dimension, O'Neill's responses\u000d\u000a      offered an independent, reasoned verification of the practitioner\u000d\u000a      responses from both police and prosecution communities.

He spoke on this at\u000d\u000a      numerous training events for local government officers after 2007, and\u000d\u000a      presented at a workshop for GTAA consultants, held in Birmingham on 10\u000d\u000a      July 2008, which contributed to a report to government on benchmarking\u000d\u000a      standards for future GTAAs; Home was involved in the resulting robustness\u000d\u000a      checks to identify circumstances or assumptions which might lead to GTAAs\u000d\u000a      either over- or underestimating need, and to suggest what sort of\u000d\u000a      adjustments might be made for greater accuracy and reliability of\u000d\u000a      evidence.\u000d\u000a    The methodology which Home and Dr. Margaret Greenfields had developed for\u000d\u000a      the Cambridge Sub-region GTAA (Romani Studies, ref.2 above) has\u000d\u000a      remained acknowledged as best practice and taken up in many of the GTAAs\u000d\u000a      undertaken for local government consortia from 2006 to the present. Home\u000d\u000a      was invited to give expert evidence at the South West Regional\u000d\u000a      Examination-in-Public of Gypsy accommodation needs, held in Exeter in\u000d\u000a      2008, resulting in revised regional guidance. In 2012 he advised Doncaster\u000d\u000a      Borough Council on its new GTAA and contributed subsequent planning appeal\u000d\u000a      expert evidence, while other GTAAs in the current round of such studies\u000d\u000a      (for the period 2011-2016) have contributed to draw upon the Cambridge\u000d\u000a      Sub-region approach, especially in relation to survey questionnaire\u000d\u000a      design.\u000d\u000a    The change of UK government in 2010 was soon followed by Basildon\u000d\u000a      Council's widely-publicized direct action against Gypsies in breach of\u000d\u000a      planning control at Dale Farm (Essex). During this time Home's research\u000d\u000a      expertise resulted in him being asked to give numerous media interviews\u000d\u000a      (local, regional and national), including Independent on Sunday (reach\u000d\u000a      metric 109,901, web reach metric 264,952), Radio Essex interviews and\u000d\u000a      Radio Sheffield (total reach metrics of 375,000), TV documentary for BBC1\u000d\u000a      Look East (reach metric 412,000).

Since the statutory\u000d\u000a      abolition of Regional Spatial Strategies and the greater local flexibility\u000d\u000a      accorded to GTAAs, Home's research methodology continues to inform new\u000d\u000a      local approaches to the new round of GTAAs, especially regarding the legal\u000d\u000a      status of 'tolerated' sites and of Gypsies settled in social housing.
